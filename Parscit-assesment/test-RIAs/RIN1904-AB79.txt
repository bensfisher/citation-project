EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
ES.1 OVERVIEW OF PRELIMINARY ACTIVITIES  
Section 6295(o)(2)(A) of 42 U.S.C. requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to 
establish energy conservation standards that are technologically feasible and economically 
justified, and would achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency. This executive 
summary summarizes the preliminary activities that DOE conducted in consideration of 
amended energy conservation standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. The 
executive summary describes the preliminary activities and summarizes key results from DOE’s 
preliminary analyses. Additionally, the executive summary delineates issues identified during the 
analyses about which DOE seeks comments from interested parties. These issues are highlighted 
in the public meeting presentation and are further discussed in chapter 2 of the preliminary 
technical support document (TSD). 
Figure ES.3.1 presents a summary of the analytical components of the standards-setting 
process and illustrates how key results are generated. The focal point of the figure is the center 
column, labeled “Analyses.” The columns labeled “Key Inputs” and “Key Outputs” show how 
the analyses fit into the process and how they relate to each other. Key inputs are the types of 
data and other information that the analyses require. Some key information is obtained from
public databases. DOE collects other inputs from interested parties or persons having special 
knowledge and expertise. Key outputs are analytical results that feed directly into the standards-
setting process. The issues on which DOE seeks comment from interested parties derive from the 
key results that are generated by the preliminary analyses. Arrows connecting analyses show the 
types of information that feed from one analysis to another.

ES.2  OVERVIEW OF THE PRELIMINARY ANALYSES AND THE 
PRELIMINARY TECHNICAL SUPPORT DOCUMENT  
For the preliminary stage, DOE publishes a notice of public meeting (NOPM) in the 
Federal Register, which announces the availability of the preliminary technical support 
document, the date and place of the public meeting, and presentation materials interested parties 
may review before the public meeting. In addition, the NOPM highlights the major analyses 
DOE developed in the preliminary stage of the rulemaking.  
The preliminary TSD describes each preliminary analysis in detail, providing detailed 
descriptions of inputs, sources, methodologies, and results. Chapter 2 of the preliminary TSD 
provides an overview of each preliminary analysis, the comments received in response to the 
analytical approaches DOE described in the framework document, and DOE’s responses to those 
comments. The following chapters of the preliminary TSD address the analyses performed for 
the preliminary stage of the rulemaking. 
A market and technology assessment (MTA) characterizes the relevant product markets 
and technology options, including prototype designs (chapter 3). 
A screening analysis reviews each technology option to determine whether it is 
technologically feasible; is practicable to manufacture, install, and service; would adversely 
affect product utility or product availability; or would have adverse impacts on health and safety 
(chapter 4). 
An engineering analysis develops cost-efficiency relationships that show a 
manufacturer’s cost of achieving increased efficiency. DOE uses manufacturer markups to 
convert manufacturer production cost (MPC) to manufacturer selling price (MSP) (chapter 5). 
A markups analysis converts the manufacturer costs derived from the engineering 
analysis to consumer equipment prices (chapter 6). 
An energy use analysis determines the annual energy use in the field of the considered 
products (chapter 7). 
Life-cycle cost (LCC) and payback period (PBP) analyses calculate, at the consumer 
level, the discounted savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the 
covered products, compared to any increase in the product’s installed cost likely to result directly 
from the imposition of a given standard (chapter 8). 
A shipments analysis forecasts product shipments, which then are used to calculate the
national impacts of standards on energy consumption, the net present value (NPV) of consumer 
costs and savings, and future manufacturer cash flows (chapter 9). 
A national impact analysis (NIA) assesses the cumulative national energy savings (NES) 
from standards and the NPV of consumer costs and savings associated with standards at different 
efficiency levels (chapter 10).

EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A preliminary manufacturer impact analysis (MIA) assesses the potential impacts of 
energy conservation standards on manufacturers, such as effects on expenditures for capital 
conversion, marketing costs, shipments, and research and development costs (chapter 12). 
The remaining chapters of the preliminary TSD address the analyses to be performed for 
the NOPR stage: 
x  A life-cycle cost analysis for subgroups evaluates the effects of energy conservation 
standards on various national subgroups of the population (chapter 11). 
x  A utility impact analysis examines impacts of energy conservation standards on the 
generation capacity of electric utilities (chapter 13). 
x  An employment impact analysis examines the effects of energy conservation standards 
on national employment (chapter 14). 
x  An environmental assessment examines the effects of energy conservation standards on 
various airborne emissions (chapter 15). 
x  A regulatory impact analysis examines the national impacts of non-regulatory alternatives 
to mandatory energy conservation standards (chapter 16). 
ES.3 KEY RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS  
The following sections describe in detail the key analyses DOE performed in support of 
the TSD. 
ES.3.1 Market and Technology Assessment  
When initiating an analysis of potential energy efficiency standards for appliance, DOE 
develops information for the products concerned on the present and past industry structure and 
market characteristics. This activity assesses industries and products both quantitatively and 
qualitatively, based on publicly available information.  
When evaluating and establishing energy conservation standards, DOE generally divides 
covered products into product classes by the type of energy used or by capacity or other 
performance-related features that affect efficiency. Different energy conservation standards may 
apply to different product classes. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q)) Table ES.3.1 describes all of the product 
classes being considered in this rulemaking.

* TTD = through the door 
** Compact refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers have less than 7.75 cubic feet (220

The product classes listed in Table ES.3.1 as proposed to be established during this 
rulemaking include the following: 
x  Product Class 5A was identified as Product Class 19 in the framework document. DOE is 
proposing to adopt the modified designation 5A to maintain consistency with Canadian 
Standards. 
ES-5  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x  Product Class 10A was identified as Product Class 20 in the framework document. DOE 
is proposing to adopt the modified designation 10A to maintain consistency with 
Canadian Standards. 
x  Product Classes 1A, 3A, 11A, and 13A are proposed as a result of proposed new test 
procedures which involve modification of compartment temperatures. According to these 
test procedures the energy use of all-refrigerators decreases, while that of the other 
products of existing Products Classes 1, 3, 11, and 13 increases significantly. Establishing 
meaningful energy standard levels for the all-refrigerators requires that they be separated 
from the other products of the existing product classes.  
The CFR establishes the test procedures for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and 
freezers. (10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendices A1 and B1) DOE has initiated a separate 
rulemaking to amend these test procedures. The proposed amendments address a number of 
issues that have emerged since the last test procedure revisions, including updating the reference 
to the AHAM HRF-1 test standard, modifying the test procedures for icemakers, specifying 
procedures for test sample preparation, modifying the test procedures for convertible 
compartments and special-purpose compartments, modification of the definition for anti-sweat 
heaters to include those that prevent sweat on interior surfaces, various test procedure language 
corrections, incorporating test procedures for variable anti-sweat systems previously addressed in 
waivers, establishing new compartment temperatures and volume calculation methods, 
modification to test procedures for advanced defrost systems, and modification of the definition 
of refrigerator-freezers to exclude combination freezer-wine storage products.  
For the residential refrigeration products that are the topic of this rulemaking, DOE 
addressed as part of the market assessment (1) manufacturer market share and characteristics, (2) 
existing regulatory and non-regulatory initiatives for improving product efficiency, and (3) 
trends in product characteristics and retail markets. This information provided data and resource 
material throughout the analysis. 
DOE reviewed literature and interviewed manufacturers to develop an overall 
understanding of the residential refrigeration products industry in the United States. Industry 
publications, including trade journals, literature from manufacturers, government agencies, and 
trade organizations provided the bulk of the information, including (1) manufacturers and their 
market share; (2) shipments by product type; (3) product information; and (4) industry trends. 
Chapter 3 of the preliminary TSD describes the market analysis and resulting information. 
DOE typically uses information about existing and past technology options and prototype 
designs to determine which technologies and combinations of technologies manufacturers use to 
attain higher performance levels. In consultation with interested parties, DOE develops a list of 
technologies to be considered. The identified technologies initially include all those DOE 
believes are technologically feasible. 
DOE developed its list of technologically feasible technologies for refrigeration products 
based on a review of trade publications, technical papers, and manufacturer literature and 
through consultation with manufacturers of components and systems. Because existing products 
ES-6  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contain many technologies for improving product efficiency, product literature and direct 
examination provided additional information. Before performing the screening analysis, DOE 
removed from the list those technologies for which the energy consumption could not be 
adequately measured using the relevant DOE test procedure. 
ES.3.2 Screening Analysis 
The screening analysis examines whether identified technologies (1) are technologically 
feasible; (2) are practicable to manufacture, install, and service; (3) have an adverse impact on 
product utility or availability; and/or (4) have adverse impacts on health and safety. As part of 
this analysis, DOE develops an initial list of options for enhancing efficiency from the 
technologies that the technology assessment identified as feasible. In consultation with interested 
parties, DOE reviews the list to assess whether the technologies: (1) are practicable to 
manufacture, install, and service; (2) would adversely affect product utility or availability; or (3) 
would have adverse impacts on health and safety. In the subsequent engineering analysis, DOE 
further examines the technology options that it did not remove from consideration in the 
screening analysis. 
ES.3.3 Engineering Analysis 
The engineering analysis (chapter 5) establishes the relationship between the cost of 
manufacturing residential refrigeration products and their efficiency. This relationship serves as 
the basis for calculating costs and benefits of modified product designs for consumers, 
manufacturers, and the Nation. Chapter 5 describes the product classes DOE analyzed, the 
representative baseline units, the efficiency levels DOE considered, the methodology DOE used 
to develop the manufacturing production cost model, and the cost-efficiency results.
ES.3.3.1 Product Classes Analyzed 
The engineering analysis analyzed seven key product classes that cover the range of 
product classes within the residential refrigeration product category and represent approximately 
90% of the shipments of these products. Based on its analysis of three product classes of 
standard-size refrigerator-freezers, two product classes within standard-size freezers, and two 
product classes within compact refrigerators and freezers, DOE generated seven cost-efficiency 
curves. The fourteen products serving as prototypical baseline-efficiency products for the 
analysis are described in Table ES.3.2. Chapter 5 includes additional details on the representative 
product classes and the cost-efficiency curves developed as part of the engineering analysis. 
DOE also reviewed the energy efficiency equations that define existing Federal energy 
conservation standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers and the impact which 
the proposed new energy test procedure would have on these equations. The proposed test 
procedure includes compartment temperature changes and changes to the method for 
determining compartment volumes. New energy efficiency equations representing current 
baseline efficiency products tested using the proposed test procedure were developed. In 
addition, these equations were examined to determine whether the slopes of the energy/adjusted 
volume curves are appropriate for the key product classes examined for the engineering analysis.  
ES-7  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The slopes of these curves determine whether the efficiency levels defined by the curves are 
more stringent for larger products as compared with smaller products.

ES.3.3.2 Manufacturing Cost Assessment 
DOE estimated the manufacturing costs associated with an increase in energy efficiency 
for each of the residential refrigeration product classes analyzed. The assessment method 
involved disassembling model units, analyzing the materials and manufacturing processes, 
analyzing the design approaches manufacturers use, and developing a spreadsheet model to 
describe costs. DOE built a detailed model for assessing manufacturing cost that estimates 
manufacturer production cost. DOE also aggregated manufacturers’ costs to maintain 
confidentiality of the data. DOE obtained input from interested parties on the manufacturing cost 
model inputs. Chapter 5 of the preliminary TSD includes information on the inputs used to 
determine the manufacturing cost, including material, labor, and overhead prices. Chapter 5 also 
includes information on the various components and features incorporated into designs for 
residential refrigeration products. 
DOE’s engineering analysis produced cost-efficiency curves for the seven representative 
refrigeration product classes. The cost-efficiency curves are described by the efficiency levels 
DOE analyzed and the increase in manufacturer selling price (MSP) required to improve a 
baseline-efficiency product to each of the considered efficiency levels. Table ES.3.2 through 
Table ES.3.4 present the key results of the engineering analysis. The maximum technology levels 
determined for the product classes (average of the two products analyzed for each product class) 
ranged from 45% to 56% except for product class 11, for which the level was 75%. Incremental 
cost curves were developed for efficiency levels up to 45% for all product classes but product 
class 7, for which the 45% level was higher than the 41% maximum technology level determined 
for one of the products of this class. DOE proposed a maximum technology level of 30% in the 
ES-8

framework document. Stakeholders commented during the framework workshop that the 
maximum level should be increased to 35%. DOE extended this level to 45% when the analysis 
indicated that higher efficiency levels could be attained. However, although the analyses, as 
described in chapter 5 of this TSD, indicated that some product classes could attain even higher 
efficiency levels, DOE did not extend incremental cost curves further due to expectations that 
higher levels would not be cost effective.

ES.3.4 Markups to Determine Product Price 
The markups analysis (chapter 6) develops appropriate markups in the distribution chain 
to convert the estimates of manufacturer cost derived in the engineering analysis to consumer 
prices. In developing markups, DOE determined the distribution channels for refrigeration 
products and the markup associated with each party in the distribution channel. For refrigeration 
products, DOE estimated markups taken by retailers, along with sales taxes. DOE developed 
separate markups for baseline products (baseline markups) and for the cost increase associated 
with improvements required to produce more-efficient products (incremental markups). Table 
ES.3.5 summarizes the markups developed for refrigeration products. Note that the manufacturer 
markup has already been incorporated into the incremental costs presented in the tables of 
Section ES.3.3.

ES.3.5 Energy Use Characterization 
The energy use characterization provides the basis for developing the energy savings 
from higher-efficiency appliances used in the LCC and subsequent analyses. The DOE test 
procedure provides standardized results that can serve as the basis for comparing the 
performance of different appliances used under the same conditions, but actual usage in the field 
may differ from usage estimated by the test procedure. DOE conducted a review of studies that 
measured the field consumption of refrigerator-freezers to compare such measurements to the 
ES-10  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DOE ratings, which confirmed that measurements of field energy use often vary considerably 
from the rated usage as determined by the DOE test procedure. 
To determine the field energy use by products that would meet possible energy efficiency 
standards, DOE used data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s 2005 Residential 
Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). RECS is a national sample survey of housing units that 
collects statistical information on the consumption of and expenditures for energy in housing 
units along with data on energy-related characteristics of the housing units and occupants. RECS 
provides enough information to establish the type (i.e., product class) of refrigeration product 
used in each household, and also provides an estimate of the household’s energy consumption 
attributable to refrigerators or freezers. As a result, DOE was able to develop a household sample 
for the representative product classes for standard-size units. DOE did not use RECS for compact 
refrigerators and freezers because a large fraction of these products are used outside the 
residential sector. 
DOE treated the RECS reported field energy consumption, referred to as FECRECS, as the 
actual consumption of the refrigeration product(s) in that household. Energy use for a 
household’s refrigerator or freezer is known to vary depending on its operating conditions, the 
behavior of its users, and other factors. DOE characterized field energy use of each product by 
using a multiplicative ‘usage adjustment factor’ (UAF) that adjusts the energy use from its test
energy consumption to reflect these factors.  
To develop a UAF for each RECS household, DOE utilized information that RECS 
provides on the size (i.e., volume), age and the product class of the refrigeration product. DOE 
determined for each household’s unit the corresponding maximum allowable tested energy 
consumption, referred to as TECSTD, based on the energy conservation standard that was in effect 
at the time the household purchased the refrigeration product. Using FECRECS and TECSTD, DOE 
then developed the UAF for each household to capture the combined effects of consumer 
behavior (e.g., door openings), operating conditions (e.g., room temperature and humidity), and 
product characteristics (e.g., efficiency relative to the minimum allowable). The UAF represents 
the adjustment that needs to be made to the maximum allowable tested energy use to arrive at the 
field energy consumption of the refrigeration product. For households that reported having 
ENERGY STAR refrigeration products, DOE calculated tested energy consumption based on the 
ENERGY STAR criteria in effect at the time the household purchased the refrigeration product. 
Chapter 7 provides more details on the methods, data, and assumptions used for developing 
UAFs. 
Tables ES.3.6 through ES.3.8 present the average annual energy use for the 
representative product classes at each considered energy efficiency level. The tables for 
standard-sized products show the average annual energy consumption calculated according to the 
proposed DOE test procedure and if the products were used in the appropriate RECS 2005 
household sub-samples (“field”). The table for compact appliances shows the average annual 
energy consumption according to the proposed DOE text procedure, using a distribution of 
product volumes based on the California Energy Commission’s appliance database.

ES.3.6 Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period Analyses 
Stipulating new energy conservation standards for products results in changes in 
consumer operating expenses—usually a decrease—and changes in consumer price—usually an 
increase. DOE analyzed the net effect of amended standards on consumers by evaluating the 
LCC using the cost-efficiency relationship derived in the engineering analysis, as well as the 
energy costs derived from the energy use characterization. Inputs to the LCC calculation 
included the installed cost to the consumer (purchase price plus installation cost), operating costs 
(energy expenses), the lifetime of the appliance, and a discount rate.  Because DOE found no 
evidence that repair or maintenance costs change as the efficiency of refrigeration products 
increases, it excluded those costs from its analysis. 
Because the installed cost of a product typically increases while operating cost typically 
decreases in response to new standards, there is a time in the life of products having higher-than-
baseline efficiency when the net operating-cost benefit (in dollars) since the time of purchase is 
equal to the incremental first cost of purchasing the higher-efficiency product. The length of time
required for products to reach this cost-equivalence point is known as the payback period (PBP). 
DOE conducted the LCC and PBP analyses using values that reflect energy consumption 
in the field. DOE identified several input values for estimating the LCC, including retail prices, 
energy prices, discount rates, and product lifetimes. DOE used EIA’s energy price data to 
determine prices for electricity in 2007 and used projections of these energy prices from EIA’s 
Annual Energy Outlook 2009 to estimate future energy prices. DOE developed discount rates 
from estimates of the finance cost for consumers that purchase refrigeration products.  
Because the basis for the lifetime estimates in the literature for refrigeration products is 
uncertain, DOE used actual data sources to estimate the distribution of refrigerator and freezer

lifetimes in the field. By combining survey results from RECS and the U.S. Census’s American 
Housing Survey with the known history of appliance shipments, DOE estimated the fraction of 
appliances of a given age still in operation. The survival function, which DOE assumed has the 
form of a cumulative Weibull distribution, provides an average and median appliance lifetime. 
To accurately estimate the share of consumers that would be affected by a standard at a 
particular efficiency level, DOE’s LCC analysis considered the projected distribution of product 
efficiencies that consumers purchase under the base case (i.e., the case without new energy 
efficiency standards). DOE refers to this distribution of product of efficiencies as a base-case 
efficiency distribution. DOE developed base-case efficiency distributions for each of the seven 
representative product classes. These distributions were developed from industry supplied data 
for the year 2007 and were comprised of product efficiencies ranging from existing baseline 
levels (i.e., meeting existing energy conservation standards) to levels meeting and exceeding 
ENERGY STAR levels. DOE then projected these distributions to the year that new standards 
are assumed to become effective (2014). To forecast the base-case efficiency distribution for 
each representative product class, DOE accounted for change in the market shares of ENERGY 
STAR appliances based on historical trends. Using the projected distribution of product 
efficiencies for each product class, DOE randomly assigned a specific product efficiency to each 
sample household. If a household was assigned a product efficiency that is greater than or equal 
to the efficiency of the standard level under consideration, the LCC calculation would show that 
this household is not impacted by that standard level.  
Table ES.3.9 through Table ES.3.15 show the results of the LCC and PBP analyses for 
the representative product classes at each considered energy efficiency level. Figures presented 
in Chapter 8 show the range of LCC savings and PBPs for all of the efficiency levels considered 
for each product class. Chapter 8 provides more details on the methods, data, and assumptions 
used for the LCC and PBP analyses.

ES.3.7 Shipments Analysis 
Shipment forecasts are needed to calculate for each product being considered the national 
impacts of standards on energy use, NPV, and future manufacturer cash flows. DOE’s shipments 
models consider shipments for new homes and replacements. Rather than simply extrapolating a 
current shipments trend, the analysis uses driver input variables to forecast sales in each market 
segment. For new housing units, annual product shipments are equal to the number of new 
housing units built multiplied by the purchase rate, which is determined by the market share of 
the product under consideration. To estimate shipments due to replacements, the models use 
sales in previous years and assumptions about the product lifetime, which determine how long an 
appliance is likely to remain in use. Chapter 9 of the TSD provides additional detail on the 
shipments analysis.

ES.3.8 National Impact Analysis 
The NIA estimates the following national impacts from possible candidate standard 
levels for residential refrigeration products: (1) national energy savings (NES); (2) monetary 
value of energy savings to consumers of the considered products due to standards; (3) increased 
total installed costs to consumers of the considered products due to standards; and (4) the net 
present value (NPV) of energy savings (difference between value of energy savings and 
increased total installed costs). DOE prepared an NES spreadsheet model to forecast energy 
savings and national consumer economic costs and savings resulting from new standards. The 
model uses typical values for inputs. 
A key component of DOE’s estimates of NES and NPV is the trend in energy efficiency 
forecasted for the base case (without new standards) and each of the standards cases (with new 
standards). To forecast the base-case efficiency distribution for each representative product class, 
DOE accounted for change in the market shares of ENERGY STAR appliances based on 
historical trends. For its determination of standards-case efficiency distributions, DOE used a 
“roll-up + ENERGY STAR” scenario to establish the distribution of efficiencies for the year that 
amended standards are assumed to become effective (i.e., 2014) and subsequent years. DOE 
assumed that product efficiencies in the base case that did not meet the standard level under 
consideration would “roll up” to meet the new standard level in 2014. It further assumed that the 
ENERGY STAR program and related efforts would continue to promote efficient appliances 
after the introduction of amended standards in 2014, and that this would lead to increased market 
shares for products with efficiency above the standard level. Chapter 10 provides additional 
details on this and other aspects of the NIA analysis. 
To estimate the national impacts of all of the product classes considered in this 
rulemaking, DOE allocated the consumer equipment costs and annual energy consumption of the 
representative product classes analyzed in detail in the engineering and LCC and PBP analyses to 
the product classes associated with each representative product class. The following list indicates 
which product classes were associated with each of the representative product classes:
x  Top-mount refrigerator-freezers: product classes 1, 1A, 2, 3, 3A, and 6; represented 
by product class 3. 
x  Bottom-mount refrigerator-freezers: product classes 5 and 5A; represented by product 
class 5. 
x  Side-by-side refrigerator-freezers: product classes 4 and 7; represented by product 
class 7. 
x  Upright freezers: product class 9 only. 
x  Chest freezers: product classes 8, 10, and 10A; represented by product class 10. 
x  Compact refrigerators: product classes 11, 11A, 12, 13, 13A, 14, and 15; represented 
by product class 11. 
x  Compact freezers: product classes 16, 17, and 18; represented by product class 18.

ES.3.8.1 National Energy Savings 
DOE calculated annual NES as the difference between national energy consumption in 
the base case (without new efficiency standards) and in each higher efficiency standard case. 
DOE estimated energy consumption and savings based on site energy and converted the 
electricity consumption and savings to source energy. Cumulative energy savings are the sum of 
the annual NES, which DOE determined over specified periods. 
The NES results shown in Table ES.3.16 through Table ES.3.18 are cumulative to 2044 
and are shown as primary energy savings in quads (quadrillion Btu’s).

ES.3.8.2 Net Present Value 
DOE calculated net monetary savings each year as the difference between total savings in 
operating costs and increases in total equipment costs in the base case and standards cases. DOE 
calculated savings over the life of the product. DOE used discount rates of 7 percent and 3 
percent to discount future costs and savings to the present. DOE calculated NPV as the 
difference between the present value of operating cost savings and the present value of increased 
total installed costs. The NPV results for the representative product classes are shown in Table 
ES.3.19 through Table ES.3.21 as the discounted value of the net savings in dollar terms.

ES.3.9 Preliminary Manufacturer Impact Analysis 
The preliminary MIA focuses on manufacturers of residential refrigeration products. 
Potential impacts include financial effects, both quantitative and qualitative, that might result 
from new energy conservation standards and lead to changes in manufacturing practices for 
refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. DOE identified potential impacts through 
interviews with manufacturers and other interested parties. Chapter 12 of the preliminary TSD 
includes details on the key issues DOE identified during the preliminary MIA. 
DOE found key issues regarding the following for residential refrigeration products:

x Increased conversion costs; 
x Impact to U.S. production and jobs; 
x Cumulative regulatory burden; 
x Impact to product utility; 
x Current economic conditions; 
x Circumvention and enforcement; and 
x Technical difficulty to achieve new standards 
DOE conducted the preliminary MIA by first identifying products, methods, and 
practices used in the residential refrigeration products industry. Next, DOE determined how 
energy efficiency improvements affect cost, production, and various other manufacturing 
metrics. Finally, DOE interviewed manufacturers for feedback. DOE developed and distributed a 
questionnaire for use during the interviews. At the beginning of the interview process, DOE 
interviewed manufacturers and adjusted the analysis as appropriate, based on the feedback 
received. During the interviews, DOE also examined any additional effects on competition, 
manufacturing capacity, direct employment, and the cumulative burden of other regulations 
affecting manufacturers, as well as several issues raised by individual manufacturers. 
ES.4 ISSUES ON WHICH DOE SEEKS PUBLIC COMMENT  
DOE is interested in receiving comments on all aspects of this preliminary analysis. DOE 
especially invites comments or data to improve DOE’s analysis, including data or information 
that will respond to the following questions or concerns that were raised in response to the 
framework document and in preparation of the preliminary TSD. 
ES.4.1 Use of the Proposed Designations for Product Classes 5A and 10A 
Two possible new product classes were identified in the framework document and 
designated product class numbers 19 and 20. DOE proposes to redesignate these product classes 
as 5A and 10A to maintain harmonization with Canadian Standards, as requested in comments 
received during the framework comment period. See chapter 2, section 2.2.1.1, of the 
preliminary TSD. 
ES.4.2 Establishment of Separate Product Classes for All-Refrigerators 
The proposed new energy test procedure uses new compartment temperatures. For 
refrigerators with freezer compartments and for refrigerator-freezers, the temperature of the fresh 
food compartment during the test would be reduced from 45 ˚F to 39 ˚F under the new test 
procedure. The freezer temperature for refrigerator-freezers would be reduced from 5 ˚F to 0 ˚F. 
ES-24  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
For both of these products, measured energy use would be significantly higher, in the range from
12 to 15%. For all-refrigerators, the compartment temperature would be increased from 38 ˚F to 
39 ˚F under the new test procedure, which would reduce measured energy use by roughly 3%. 
Product classes 1, 3, 11, and 13 include products such as refrigerators with freezer compartments 
and refrigerator-freezers, whose energy use would increase, as well as all-refrigerators, whose 
energy use would decrease. In order to maintain a meaningful and fair energy conservation 
standard for these product classes, DOE proposes that new product classes be established for the 
all-refrigerators. DOE seeks comment on this proposal.  
ES.4.3 Possible Combination of Product Classes 1 and 2, and Product Classes 11 and 12 
Shipments of refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers of product classes 1 and 2 are very 
low, significantly less than 1% of the shipments of residential refrigeration products. DOE 
believes that the shipments of refrigerator-freezers of product class 12 are also very low. The 
energy standards for product classes 1 and 2 are currently identical. While the energy standard 
for product class 12 is considerably less stringent that the standard for product class 11, there is 
no clear technical basis that DOE can currently discern for the difference. Product classes 1 and 
11 include refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers with manual defrost. Product classes 2 and 12 
include refrigerator-freezers with partial automatic defrost. Both product class groups have 
manual defrost evaporators serving the freezer compartments. However, product classes 2 and 12
include an evaporator serving the fresh food compartment that does not require manual defrost. 
Typically this evaporator would warm sufficiently during the compressor off-cycle to melt frost. 
For this reason, there is no defrost cycle involved that would add energy use. DOE invites 
comment on whether these pairs of product classes should be combined, thus eliminating product 
classes 2 and 12. 
ES.4.4 Approach for Development of Baseline Energy Use/Adjusted Volume Relationships 
under the Proposed Test Procedure 
In a separate rulemaking, DOE expects to propose new test procedures based in part on 
the updated version of AHAM Standard HRF-1-2008. The test procedures would include 
modified compartment temperatures and a modified volume calculation method. In general, if 
test procedure revisions affect the measured efficiency of a product, the required efficiency 
levels must be adjusted based on test results with the new test procedure for products which are 
minimally compliant under the previous test procedure. (U.S.C. 6293(e)(2)) AHAM provided 
data for some key product classes showing the differences in energy test results of the two test 
procedures. DOE developed curves relating energy use and adjusted volume for minimally-
compliant products based on use of the modified test procedure for all of the product classes 
relying in part on the AHAM data. DOE proposes to use these curves, discussed in Chapter 5 of 
the preliminary TSD, as the basis for the new energy conservation standards to be proposed 
initially in the NOPR phase of the rulemaking. DOE invites comment on the approach used to 
develop the curves and the resulting energy use represented by the curves.

ES.4.5 Possible Modification of the Baseline Energy Use/Adjusted Volume Curve Slope 
During manufacturer interviews conducted as part of the preliminary process, some
manufacturers indicated that some of the energy vs. adjusted volume curves of the current energy 
conservation standards for residential refrigeration products have slopes that are not consistent 
with actual energy trends. DOE concluded during the engineering analysis that the cost and 
energy analysis conducted for two different sizes of product of each product class was not 
sufficiently precise to allow accurate predictions of size-based differences in the cost-efficiency 
trends for the products analyzed. Hence, correction of the slopes of the energy vs. adjusted 
volume curves is not possible based on the differences in incremental cost curves of the two sizes 
analyzed for each product class. DOE conducted an energy use analysis to investigate this issue 
more directly. The analysis shows that the slope of the baseline-efficiency energy use curve may 
be too low for product class 5. Similarly, the slope of the curve for product class 4 may be too 
low (While DOE did not directly analyze this product class, the trend for product class 7 would 
apply to product class 4 with an adjustment for the TTD ice feature present in product class 7 -- 
TTD ice is not present in product class 4). The DOE analysis investigating this issue is discussed 
in Chapter 5. DOE invites comment on whether an adjustment to the slopes of the baseline 
energy use relationships based on proposed test procedures is warranted for any of the product 
classes and by how much. DOE requests information supporting comments indicating the need 
for such slope changes.
ES.4.6 Variation of Product Characteristics as Compared with Teardown Products 
DOE selected representative refrigeration products for detailed investigation. This 
investigatory work encompassed a variety of activities, including reverse engineering, physical 
teardown, manufacturing cost analysis, energy use analysis, and cost-effectiveness analyses 
regarding energy-reducing design options. DOE requested detailed design data for refrigeration 
products during the framework phase of the work, as embodied in Table A-10 of the framework 
document. Manufacturers, however, did not provide data in response to this request. Such design 
data would have allowed consideration of the variation of product designs, particularly variation 
of the costs to achieve reductions in energy use. DOE requests comment on the variation of 
refrigeration product designs and the distribution of incremental costs to achieve energy use 
reductions. 
ES.4.7 Development of Energy Standards for Low-Volume Products 
The TSD describes possible approaches to the development of energy standards for low-
volume products which were not directly analyzed during the preliminary analysis. The percent 
reduction in energy use for most of these product classes would be based on the percentage 
reduction established for similar product classes. These approaches are presented in Chapter 2, 
Section 2.15. DOE requests comments on these approaches. 
ES.4.8 Field Energy Use of Standard-Size Refrigeration Products 
Energy use of a household’s refrigerator or freezer is known to vary depending on its 
operating conditions, the behavior of its users, and other factors. DOE characterized field energy 
ES-26  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use of a refrigeration product by using a multiplicative ‘usage adjustment factor’ (UAF) that
adjusts the energy use from its test energy consumption to reflect these factors. The household 
sample used to calculate life-cycle costs for standard-sized products exhibits a wide range of 
UAFs for each product class, with mean values ranging from 1.08 for product class 5 to 1.48 for 
product class 10. A literature survey conducted by DOE confirms that an average UAF over the 
lifetime of a refrigeration product is likely to be greater than one. This literature spans most of 
the last two decades, but relatively few studies have been published recently. DOE invites 
comment and additional data regarding the relationship between field and test energy 
consumption for contemporary refrigeration products. 
ES.4.9 Field Energy Use of Compact Refrigeration Products 
DOE did not find any usable data on the typical field energy consumption of compact 
products. Therefore, for compact refrigerators and freezers, DOE assumed that the average field 
energy use of units of the representative sizes used in its analysis is the same as the energy use 
calculated by the DOE test procedure. DOE assumed that the variability of energy use of 
compact products in the field is solely a function of volume. To represent the distribution of 
volumes in the field, DOE used data from the 2008 California Energy Commission appliance 
model database. DOE invites comment and additional data regarding the relationship between 
field and test energy consumption for compact refrigeration products. 
ES.4.10 Repair and Maintenance Costs 
Because DOE did not find any evidence that repair and maintenance costs change as 
refrigeration product efficiency increases, it did not include these costs in its analysis. DOE 
invites comment on this approach and requests any specific information showing the extent to 
which repair and maintenance costs change as refrigeration product efficiency increases beyond 
the baseline levels used in DOE’s analysis. 
ES.4.11 Lifetime of Compact Refrigeration Products 
When DOE applied the average lifetime for a compact refrigerator given in Appliance 
magazine (10 years) to historical shipments, its model yielded a compact refrigerator stock that 
was more than double the existing stock indicated by the EIA’s RECS and Commercial Building 
Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). DOE therefore calibrated the average lifetime to match 
the existing stock of compact refrigerators as given by the surveys. The resulting calculated 
mean lifetime is 5.62 years. DOE invites comment on its approach for estimating the lifetime for 
compact refrigerators and freezers. 
ES.4.12 Base Case Efficiency Distributions 
To accurately estimate the share of consumers that would be affected by a standard at a 
particular efficiency level, DOE’s LCC and PBP analyses considered the projected distribution 
of product efficiencies that consumers would purchase in the base case (i.e., the case without 
amended energy efficiency standards). DOE’s projection takes into account growth in market 
ES-27

share of ENERGY STAR refrigeration products in the coming years. DOE invites comment on 
the approach used to forecast base-case market shares of the considered efficiency levels. 
ES.4.13 Forecasted Market Shares of Top-Mount vs. Side/Bottom-Mount Refrigerator-
Freezers 
DOE developed a simple model to forecast the market share of top-mount refrigerator-
freezers relative to side- and bottom-mounted products. This model was based on the historical 
consumer preferences of homeowners as a whole, as well as high-income homeowners, the 
historical market share differences between rental and owner-occupied households, and historical 
market shares of top-, side- and bottom-mount products in total shipments. The model forecasts 
that the market share of top-mount refrigerator-freezers will fall slowly, reaching 58.3% in 2015, 
56.2% in 2025, and 54.7% in 2035, with the remainder of shipments divided between side- and 
bottom-mount products in a ratio fixed by their relative sales in 2008. DOE seeks comment on its 
approach. 
ES.4.14 Maturity of Vacuum Insulation Panels for High Volume Production 
The engineering analysis indicates that dramatic reductions in energy use are possible in 
many of the product classes. The reductions depend on use of a number of design options, 
including vacuum insulation panels (VIPs). VIPs are currently used in refrigeration products, 
indicating that this technology is a viable design option.  The use of VIPs adds dramatically to 
the MSP estimates, up to $300 in the preliminary analyses. The LCC analysis indicates that 
efficiency levels incorporating VIPs are economically justified. Hence, DOE anticipates that 
standard levels may be proposed at levels requiring much more widespread use of VIPs in future 
products. DOE collected information regarding the viability of VIPs during the preliminary 
analysis. However, the importance of this technology to the preliminary results indicates that a 
more careful review is warranted of its viability for high volume production. DOE invites 
comments on this issue and also requests information that would allow such an assessment to be 
conducted. 
ES.4.15 Clarification of the Distinction between Manual Defrost and Automatic Defrost 
for All-Refrigerators 
DOE is considering adding product classes 1A and 3A for all-refrigerators with manual 
and automatic defrost. It is uncertain whether there are any products of the proposed product 
class 1A, because all-refrigerators typically use off-cycle defrost, which does not require manual 
initiation. Manual defrost “is accomplished by natural or manual means with manual initiation
and manual termination of the over-all defrost operation”. AHAM HRF-1-1979 DOE requests 
comment on the interpretation that off-cycle defrost is a form of automatic defrost for all-
refrigerators. DOE also requests comment on whether there are any all-refrigerator products on 
the market that use manual defrost.

ES.4.16 Analysis of Built-In Products 
Comments made during the framework meeting and comment period and discussion of 
potential addition of product classes for built-in products is discussed in Chapter 2 of the 
preliminary TSD. DOE seeks additional technical and cost information on built-in products that 
would aid in assessment of whether the costs to achieve higher efficiency levels are significantly 
higher with these products. 
ES.4.17 Technical Data for Alternative Foam-Blowing Agents 
Stakeholders indicated during the framework meeting and comment period that DOE 
should consider the effect of potential climate change legislation on the rulemaking analyses (see 
Chapter 2 of the preliminary TSD). DOE seeks up to date technical data on the resistivity 
differences and the impact to thermal performance of alternative foam-blowing agents. 
ES.4.18 Likely Scenarios for Alternative Foam-Blowing Agents 
DOE seeks comment on the likely scenarios for manufacturers, assuming that laws such 
as the current pending legislation banning HFC’s are passed. Specifically, DOE seeks 
information regarding the timing of switching to alternative agents. 
ES.4.19 Valuing Air-Borne Emission Reductions 
DOE will conduct an environmental assessment as part of the next phase of the standards 
rulemaking; the NOPR.  The primary environmental effects of energy conservation standards for 
refrigeration products are to reduce power plant emissions resulting from reduced consumption 
of electricity. DOE will assess these environmental effects by using NEMS-BT to provide key 
inputs to its analysis. The portion of the environmental assessment that will be produced by 
NEMS-BT considers carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and 
mercury (Hg).  DOE also plans on monetizing the emission reductions due to standards 
consistent with methods used in recent DOE standards rulemakings pertaining to refrigerated 
beverage vending machines and commercial clothes washers.  For example, in the case of CO2, 
DOE used values ranging from $5 to $55 per metric ton of CO2 to value the emission savings due 
to standards.  DOE invites comments on the approaches for monetizing the emission savings due 
to energy conservation standards.

CHAPTER 1.  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 PURPOSE OF THE DOCUMENT  
This preliminary technical support document (preliminary TSD) is a stand-alone report 
that provides the technical analyses and results supporting the information presented in the 
preliminary notice of public meeting (NOPM) and executive summary for residential 
refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. This preliminary TSD reports on the preliminary 
activities and analyses conducted in the period preceding the notice of proposed rulemaking 
(NOPR) of this rulemaking. 
1.2  OVERVIEW OF STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL REFRIGERATORS, 
REFRIGERATOR-FREEZERS, AND FREEZERS 
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, Pub. L. 94-163 (42 United 
States Code (U.S.C.) 6291–6309), established an energy conservation program for major 
household appliances. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1978 (NECPA), Pub. L. 
95-619, amended EPCA to add Part Ca of Title III (42 U.S.C. 6311–6317), which established an 
energy conservation program for certain industrial equipment. Additional amendments to EPCA 
give DOE the authority to regulate the energy efficiency of several products, including 
residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers—the products that are the focus of 
this document. The amendments to EPCA in the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 
1987 (NAECA), Pub. L. 100-12, established energy conservation standards for refrigerators, 
refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, as well as requirements for determining whether these 
standards should be amended. (42 U.S.C. 6295(b)) 
NAECA first established performance standards for residential refrigerators, refrigerator-
freezers, and freezers, and further required that DOE conduct two cycles of rulemakings to 
determine if more stringent standards are justified.b (42 U.S.C. 6295(b)) On November 17, 1989, 
DOE published a final rule in the Federal Register updating the performance standards; the new 
standards became effective on January 1, 1993. 54 FR 47916. Subsequent to this final rule, DOE 
determined that new standards for some of the product classes were based on incomplete data 
and incorrect analysis. As a result, DOE published a correction that amended the new standards 
for three product classes: (1) refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers with manual defrost, (2) 
refrigerator-freezers—automatic defrost with bottom-mounted freezer but without through-the-
door (TTD) ice service, and (3) chest freezers and all other freezers. 55 FR 42845 (Oct. 24, 
1990). DOE updated the performance standards once again for refrigerators, refrigerator-
a Part C has been redesignated Part A-1 
b  Definition of “refrigerators”, “refrigerator-freezers”, and “freezers” is provided in chapter 3 of the preliminary 
TSD.

freezers, and freezers by publishing a final rule in the Federal Register on April 28, 1997. 62 FR 
23102. The new standards became effective on July 1, 2001. By completing a second standards 
rulemaking, DOE had fulfilled its legislative requirement to conduct two cycles of standards 
rulemakings. 
Stakeholders submitted a petition in 2004 requesting that DOE conduct another 
rulemaking to amend the standards for residential refrigerator-freezers. In April 2005, DOE 
granted the petition and conducted a limited set of analyses to assess the potential energy savings 
and economic benefit of new standards. DOE issued a report in October 2005 detailing the 
analyses.1 The analysis examined the technological and economic feasibility of new standards set 
at Energy Star levels effective in 2005 for the two most popular product classes of refrigerators: 
top-mount refrigerator-freezers without TTD features and side-mount refrigerator-freezers with 
TTD features. DOE confined its updated analysis to these two classes because they accounted for 
a majority of current product shipments. Depending on assumptions about the impact that 
standards would have on market efficiency, DOE estimated that amended standards at the 2005 
Energy Star levels would yield between 2.4 to 3.4 quads,c with an associated economic impact to 
the Nation ranging from a burden or cost of $1.2 billion to a benefit or savings of $3.3 billion.d 
DOE published draft data sheets containing energy-savings potentials for refrigerator-
freezers in October 2005 as part of its fiscal year 2006 schedule-setting process. These data 
sheets summarized the following in table format: (1) the potential energy savings from
regulatory action in cumulative quads from 2010 to 2035, (2) the potential economic benefits or 
burdens, (3) the potential environmental or energy security benefits, (4) the status of required 
changes to test procedures, (5) other regulatory actions, (6) recommendations by interested 
parties, (7) evidence of market-driven or voluntary efficiency improvements, (8) regulatory 
issues, and (9) the 2005 priority. The data sheets for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers were 
based on the October 2005 draft technical report analyzing potential new amended energy 
conservation standards for residential refrigerator-freezers described above. This report and the 
associated data sheets provided input to the setting of priorities for rulemakings activities. Other 
products were given a higher priority, and limited rulemaking work on refrigerators and freezers 
was carried out in the following years prior to the enactment of the Energy Independence and 
Security Act of 2007 (EISA). 
EISA, signed into law on December 19, 2007, requires that DOE publish a final rule no 
later than December 31, 2010, to determine whether to amend the standards in effect for 
refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers manufactured on or after January 1, 2014. As a 
result, DOE is embarking on a standards rulemaking for these products to comply with the 
requirements of EISA.

1.3 PROCESS FOR SETTING ENERGY CONERVATION STANDARDS 
Under EPCA, when DOE is studying new or amended standards, it must consider, to the 
greatest extent practicable, the following seven factors (42 U.S.C. 6295 (o)(2)(B)(i)): 
1)  the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and consumers of the affected 
products; 
2) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the product  
compared to any increases in the initial cost or maintenance expense;   
3)  the total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition 
of the standard; 
4) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the products likely to result from the 
imposition of the standard;  
5)  the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney 
General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;  
6) the need for national energy conservation; and  
7) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.   
Other statutory requirements are set forth in 42 U.S.C. 6295 (o)(1)–(2)(A), (2)(B)(ii)– 
(iii), and (3)–(4) and 42 U.S.C. 6316(e). 
DOE considers stakeholder participation to be a very important part of the process for 
setting energy conservation standards. Through formal public notifications (i.e., Federal Register 
notices), DOE actively encourages the participation and interaction of all stakeholders during the 
comment period in each stage of the rulemaking. Beginning with the Framework Document and 
during subsequent comment periods, interactions among stakeholders provide a balanced 
discussion of the information that is required for the standards rulemaking. 
Before DOE determines whether or not to adopt a proposed energy conservation 
standard, it must first solicit comments on the proposed standard. (42 U.S.C. 6313(a)(6)(B)(i)) 
Any new or amended standard must be designed to achieve significant additional conservation of
energy and be technologically feasible and economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 6313(a)(6)(A)) To 
determine whether economic justification exists, DOE must review comments on the proposal 
and determine that the benefits of the proposed standard exceed its burdens to the greatest extent 
practicable, weighing the seven factors listed above. (42 U.S.C. 6295 (o)(2)(B)(i)) 
After the publication of the framework document, the energy conservation standards 
rulemaking process involves three additional, formal public notices, which DOE publishes in the 
Federal Register. The first of the rulemaking notices is a NOPM, which is designed to publicly 
1-3  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
vet the models and tools used in the preliminary rulemaking and to facilitate public participation 
before the NOPR stage. The second notice is the NOPR, which presents a discussion of 
comments received in response to the NOPM and the preliminary analyses and analytical tools; 
analyses of the impacts of potential amended energy conservation standards on consumers, 
manufacturers, and the Nation; DOE’s weighting of these impacts of amended energy 
conservation standards; and the proposed energy conservation standards for each product. The 
third notice is the final rule, which presents a discussion of the comments received in response to 
the NOPR; the revised analyses; DOE’s weighting of these impacts; the amended energy 
conservation standards DOE is adopting for each product; and the effective dates of the amended 
energy conservation standards. 
In September 2008, DOE published a notice of public meeting and availability of the 
framework document. 73 FR 54089 (September 18, 2008). The framework document, 
Rulemaking Framework for Residential Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezers, and Freezers, 
describes the procedural and analytical approaches DOE anticipated using to evaluate the 
establishment of amended energy conservation standards for these products. This document is 
available at: 
http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/refrigerator_freezer 
_framework.pdf. 
Subsequently, DOE held a public meeting on September 29, 2008, to discuss procedural 
and analytical approaches to the rulemaking. In addition, DOE used the public meeting to inform
and facilitate involvement of interested parties in the rulemaking process. The analytical 
framework presented at the public meeting described the different analyses, such as the 
engineering analysis and the consumer economic analyses (i.e., the life-cycle cost (LCC) and 
payback period (PBB) analyses), the methods proposed for conducting them, and the 
relationships among the various analyses.

During the September 2008 public meeting, interested parties commented about 
numerous issues relating to each one of the analyses listed in Table 1.3.1. Comments from
interested parties submitted during the framework document comment period elaborated on the 
issues raised during the public meeting. DOE attempted to address these issues during its 
preliminary analyses and summarized the comments and DOE’s responses in chapter 2 of the 
preliminary TSD. 
As part of the information gathering and sharing process, DOE organized and held 
interviews with manufacturers of the residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers 
considered in this rulemaking as part of the engineering analysis. DOE selected companies that 
represented production of all types of products, ranging from small to large manufacturers, and 
included the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) member companies. DOE 
had four objectives for these interviews: (1) solicit manufacturer feedback on the draft inputs to 
the engineering analysis; (2) solicit feedback on topics related to the preliminary manufacturer 
impact analysis; (3) provide an opportunity, early in the rulemaking process, to express 
manufacturers’ concerns to DOE; and (4) foster cooperation between manufacturers and DOE. 
DOE incorporated the information gathered during the engineering interviews with 
manufacturers into its engineering analysis (Chapter 5) and the preliminary manufacturer impact 
analysis (Chapter 12). Following the publication of the preliminary analyses and the NOPM 
public meeting, DOE intends to hold additional meetings with manufacturers as part of the 
consultative process for the manufacturer impact analysis conducted during the NOPR phase of 
the rulemaking. 
DOE developed spreadsheets for the engineering, LCC, PBP, and national impact 
analyses for each product. For each product, DOE developed an LCC spreadsheet that calculates 
1-5  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the LCC and PBP at various energy efficiency levels. DOE also developed a national impact 
analysis spreadsheet that calculates the national energy savings (NES) and national net present 
values (NPVs) at various energy efficiency levels. This spreadsheet includes a model that 
forecasts the impacts of amended energy conservation standards at various levels on product 
shipments. All of these spreadsheets are available on the DOE website for refrigerators and 
freezers 
(http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/refrigerators_freezers.ht 
ml).

CHAPTER 2.  ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK, COMMENTS FROM  
INTERESTED PARTIES, AND DOE RESPONSES 
2.1 INTRODUCTION  
 Section 6295(o)(2)(A) of 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) requires the U.S. Department of 
Energy (DOE) to set forth energy conservation standards that are technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and would achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency. This 
chapter provides a description of the general analytical framework that DOE uses in developing 
such standards. The analytical framework is a description of the methodology, the analytical 
tools, and relationships among the various analyses that are part of this rulemaking. For example, 
the methodology that addresses the statutory requirement for economic justification includes 
analyses of life-cycle cost (LCC), economic impact on manufacturers and users, national 
benefits, impacts, if any, on utility companies, and impacts, if any, from lessening competition 
among manufacturers. 
  
 The analyses performed as part of the preliminary analysis stage and reported in this 
preliminary technical support document (preliminary TSD) are listed below. 
 
x A market and technology assessment to characterize the relevant product markets and 
existing technology options, including prototype designs. 
x A screening analysis to review each technology option and determine if it: is 
technologically feasible; is practical to manufacture, install, and service; would adversely 
affect product utility or product availability; or would have adverse impacts on health and 
safety. 
x An engineering analysis to develop cost-efficiency relationships that show the 
manufacturer’s cost of achieving increased efficiency. DOE determines the increased cost 
to the consumer through an analysis of engineering markups, which convert manufacturer 
production cost (MPC) to manufacturer selling price (MSP).  
x An energy use analysis to determine the annual energy use of the considered products. 
x LCC and payback period (PBP) analyses to calculate, at the consumer level, the 
discounted savings in operating costs (less maintenance and repair costs) throughout the 
estimated average life of the covered products, compared to any increase in the installed 
cost for the products likely to result directly from imposition of the standard. 
x A shipments analysis to forecast product shipments, which then are used to calculate the 
national impacts of standards on energy, net present value (NPV), and future 
manufacturer cash flows. 
x A national impact analysis (NIA) to assess the aggregate impacts at the national level of 
the NPV of total consumer LCC and national energy savings (NES). 
x A preliminary manufacturer impact analysis to assess the potential impacts of energy 
conservation standards on manufacturers, such as impacts on capital conversion 
expenditures, marketing costs, shipments, and research and development costs.

 The analyses DOE will perform in the subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(NOPR) stage include those listed below. In addition, DOE will revise the analyses it performed 
during the preliminary analysis stage based on comments and new information received. 
 
x An LCC subgroup analysis to evaluate variations in customer characteristics that might 
cause a standard to affect particular consumer sub-populations, such as low-income 
households, differently than the overall population. 
x A manufacturer impact analysis to estimate the financial impact of standards on 
manufacturers and to calculate impacts on competition, employment, and manufacturing 
capacity. 
x A utility impact analysis to estimate the effects of proposed standards on electric, gas, or 
oil utilities. 
x An employment impact analysis to assess the aggregate impacts on national employment. 
x An environmental impact analysis to provide estimates of the effects of amended energy 
conservation standards on emissions of carbon (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen 
oxides (NOx), and mercury. 
x A regulatory impact analysis to present major alternatives to proposed amended energy 
conservation standards that could achieve substantially the same regulatory goal at a 
lower cost. 
  
 DOE developed this analytical framework and documented its findings in the 
Rulemaking Framework Document for Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezers, and Freezers 
(September 18, 2008). DOE presented the analytical approach to interested parties during a 
public meeting held on September 29, 2008. The framework document is available at 
http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/refrigerators_freezers.ht
ml.  
 
 In response to the publication of the framework document and the framework public 
meeting, DOE received numerous comments from interested parties regarding DOE’s analytical 
approach. This chapter (chapter 2) of the preliminary TSD summarizes the key comments DOE 
received from interested parties and describes DOE’s responses to those comments. In addition, 
in subsequent sections of this chapter, DOE has summarized any significant changes in analytical 
approach made since publishing the framework document that DOE used in its preliminary 
analyses. Lastly, in the executive summary of the preliminary TSD, DOE identified a number of 
issues for which DOE seeks public comment. DOE has explained each of those issues in the 
relevant analysis sections below.  
2.2 MARKET AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 
 When DOE begins an energy conservation standards rulemaking, it develops information 
that provides an overall picture of the market for the products considered, including the nature of 
the products, the industry structure, and market characteristics for the products. This activity 
consists of both quantitative and qualitative efforts based primarily on publicly available 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22

information. The subjects addressed in the market assessment included manufacturers, trade 
associations, and the quantities and types of products sold and offered for sale. DOE examined 
manufacturers of residential refrigeration products, which included both large and small and 
foreign and domestic manufacturers. DOE also examined data supplied by the key trade 
association for this product category, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
(AHAM). DOE also reviewed shipment data collected by AHAM and Appliance Magazine. 
Finally, DOE also reviewed other energy efficiency programs from utilities, individual states, 
and other organizations. Chapter 3 of the preliminary TSD provides additional details on the 
market and technology assessment. 
 
 DOE reviewed relevant literature and interviewed manufacturers to develop an overall 
picture of the residential refrigeration products industry in the United States. Industry 
publications and trade journals, government agencies, and trade organizations provided the bulk 
of the information, including:  (1) manufacturers and their market shares; (2) shipments by 
product type (i.e., refrigerator, freezer, etc.); (3) product information; and (4) industry trends.  
  
 Subsequent sections of this chapter of the preliminary TSD describe the comments DOE 
received in response to its review of the market for the framework document. The analysis 
developed as part of the market and technology assessment is described in chapter 3 of the 
preliminary TSD. 
2.2.1 Definitions 
In the framework document, DOE delineated 20 different product classes for residential 
refrigeration products. Of these, 18 product classes based on the following characteristics are 
already contained in the CFR: type of unit (refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, or freezer), 
geometric configuration for refrigerator-freezers (freezer mounting on top, side, or bottom), size 
of the cabinet (standard or compact), type of defrost system (manual, partial, or automatic), and 
presence or absence of through-the-door (TTD) ice service. DOE proposed two additional 
product classes (designated 19 and 20 in the framework document) beyond those presented in the 
CFR: automatic defrost refrigerator-freezers with bottom-mounted freezer and TTD ice service 
and chest freezers with automatic defrost. 
 
DOE received comments on the product definitions presented in the framework 
document. In response, DOE reviewed the definitions for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and 
freezers to determine scope of coverage as it pertains to the new product classes designated 19 
and 20 in the framework document, and examined the DOE refrigerator test procedure to 
determine product classification for products with convertible compartments. Discussion of these 
issues is presented below.  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-4
2.2.1.1 Automatic Defrost Refrigerator-Freezers with Bottom-Mounted Freezer 
and with TTD Ice Service and Chest Freezers with Automatic Defrost 
DOE received several comments regarding the classification of automatic defrost 
refrigerator-freezers with bottom-mounted freezer and TTD ice service. AHAM stated that DOE 
should re-label its proposed product class 19 as product class 5A so as to be consistent with 
Canadian product class definitions. (AHAM, No. 11 at p. 3) Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) 
agreed with that view and added that DOE should classify its proposed product class 20 as 
product class 10A. (NRCan, No. 16 at pp. 2-3) 
 
DOE believes that harmonization with international standards is important to reduce the 
costs of compliance and should be done whenever possible. DOE concurs with AHAM and  
NRCan and has re-designated product classes 19 and 20 as product classes 5A and 10A, 
respectively, to maintain consistency with Canadian standards. 
2.2.1.2 Refrigeration Products with Convertible Compartments 
Interested parties submitted a number of comments about convertible compartments to 
DOE. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), the Appliance 
Standards Awareness Project (ASAP), the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), the National 
Consumer Law Center (NCLC), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Northeast 
Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP), the Northwest Power and Conservation Council 
(NPCC), Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), and Southern California Edison (SCE) submitted a 
joint comment to DOE, hereafter referred to as the “Joint Comment,” stating that: (1) the test 
procedure should be updated to reflect product configurations that are currently on the market; 
(2) convertible bottom-drawer refrigerator-freezers should be rated with the convertible drawer 
operating as a freezer, which is not the way some of these products have been rated for 
ENERGY STAR; and (3) the convertible bottom-drawer refrigerator-freezer should be rated as 
bottom-mount refrigerator-freezer (product class 5A). (Joint Comment, No. 10 at pp. 2,3)  
 
Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool) agreed that convertible bottom-drawer products 
should be considered to be “classification 19”, adding that units with convertible compartments 
must be tested in their highest-energy state. (Whirlpool, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 
62-63, No. 17 at p. 4) However, both Whirlpool and General Electric (GE) clarified that testing 
of a convertible compartment as a freezer may define the product as something other than a 
bottom-mount refrigerator-freezer with TTD ice, and that the product should be rated the way it 
is tested. (Whirlpool, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 63-64; GE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 7 at p. 63-64) AHAM made a similar statement, adding that a convertible 
automatic defrost bottom-mount refrigerator-freezer equipped with no ice or water dispenser 
should be classified under product class 5 and that it should be tested with the convertible 
compartment operating as a freezer compartment in one test and as a fresh food compartment in 
a second test to determine which configuration has the highest energy use. (AHAM, No. 11 at p. 
4)  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-5
Several of the comments noted that the requirement to test a convertible compartment in 
its highest-energy state comes from AHAM Standard HRF-1, the 1979 edition of which is 
referenced by the current DOE energy test procedure for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers. 
 
DOE has learned that the convertible bottom-drawer product that prompted the question 
posed in the framework document is no longer on the market, but that a different product with 
convertible compartments was introduced by another manufacturer. This second product is rated 
in the ENERGY STAR database with one of the convertible compartments operating as a freezer 
compartment, and one operating as a fresh food compartment. DOE does not intend at this time 
to establish a new product class based on such a configuration. DOE agrees with stakeholder 
comments regarding the requirement that a convertible-compartment product be rated with the 
compartment in its highest energy-use position under the current DOE energy test procedures. In 
the NOPR addressing possible amendments to the test procedure, DOE considers whether the 
test procedure should be modified to improve clarity regarding this test requirement. 
 
DOE further notes that issues associated with multiple compartments and/or separate 
temperature control of drawers or otherwise isolated spaces within compartments will present a 
challenge to the energy test procedure that will require consideration as such features are more 
frequently added to products. For example, the test procedure does not indicate clearly how to 
adjust temperature setpoints and how to average compartment temperatures for a refrigerator-
freezer that has multiple fresh food compartments, multiple freezer compartments, or large 
internal sub-compartments that have separate temperature control. DOE notes that working 
Group 12 of Technical Committee 59 of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is 
developing IEC 62552, an international test procedure for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and 
freezers. The issue of establishing test procedures to accurately address such product features has 
been discussed as part of the IEC test procedure development. DOE anticipates that future DOE 
energy test revisions will consider approaches adopted by the IEC test procedure to address these 
issues. 
2.2.2 Product Classes and Scope of Coverage 
 When evaluating and establishing energy conservation standards, DOE generally divides 
covered products into product classes by the type of energy used, capacity, or performance-
related features that affect efficiency. Different energy conservation standards may apply to 
different product classes. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q))  
 
 DOE received several comments from interested parties regarding the product classes and 
their organization. Specifically, DOE received comments regarding whether to include built-in 
refrigeration products and wine storage products as additional product classes. 
2.2.2.1 Built-In Refrigeration Products  
 DOE received several comments on the inclusion of built-in refrigeration products as a 
separate product class. Sub Zero-Wolf, Inc. (Sub-Zero) requested that DOE establish separate 
product classes for built-in refrigeration products because they provide distinct utility and have

limited potential for energy improvement compared to conventional freestanding units. Sub-Zero 
cited the distinction made for compact products in the previous refrigerator energy conservation 
standard rulemaking as an example of establishment of separate product classes for products for 
which options for efficiency improvements are limited. Sub-Zero also noted that built-in 
products are a niche market with low production volumes, comprising perhaps 1.5% of all 
residential refrigeration product shipments. (Sub-Zero, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at pp. 
61-62 and No. 9 at pp. 1-3) The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) agreed, suggesting that DOE 
include built-in products as a separate product class. (EEI, No. 13 at p. 3) The Joint Comment 
disagreed, stating that DOE should not include built-in refrigeration products as a separate 
product class because built-ins provide the same service and amenity to consumers as standalone 
units, and they believe that manufacturers will find ways to make built-ins that meet performance 
standards similar to standalone units. The Joint Comment also notes that built-in units can 
already exceed ENERGY STAR and the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE) Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 efficiency levels. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 3), 
 
Sub-Zero further detailed the request for built-in product classes in a written comment. 
(Sub-Zero, No. 9 at p. 1-3) This comment suggests the following possible built-in product 
classes. 
 
x Built-in auto defrost top mount refrigerator-freezer w/o TTD ice and auto defrost all-
refrigerators 
x Built-in auto defrost top mount refrigerator-freezer w/TTD ice  
x Built-in auto defrost bottom mount refrigerator-freezer w/o TTD ice 
x Built-in auto defrost bottom mount refrigerator-freezer w/TTD ice 
x Built-in auto defrost side-by-side refrigerator-freezer w/o TTD ice 
x Built-in auto defrost side-by-side refrigerator-freezer w/TTD ice 
x Built-in auto defrost upright freezer 
x Built-in compact refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers 
  
Sub-Zero also pointed out in the written comment a number of design differences 
between built-in products and conventional products that make achieving higher efficiency levels 
more difficult for built-in products. (Sub-Zero, No. 9 at p. 2) These include the following.  
 
x More doors and drawers than conventional units, which leads to greater gasket length and 
door frame/gasket thermal load. 
x Limited access to condenser airflow since the products must be designed to be constrained by 
installation between cabinets. 
x More firm constraints on increases in exterior dimensions to allow increase in insulation 
thickness. 
x Use of glass doors. 
x Design for multiple compartments of different temperatures. 
x More complex hinge systems, which impact the ability to insulate the cabinet in the hinge 
region. 
 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-7
DOE notes that establishment of separate product classes must be based on consumption 
of a different kind of energy, or a different capacity or other performance-related feature that 
other products within a product group do not share. The Secretary must consider such factors as 
the utility to the consumer of such a feature and other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate, 
and any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency shall include an 
explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(q))  
 
Based on information received in discussions with manufacturers during the preliminary 
phase of the rulemaking, DOE is aware that achieving ENERGY STAR qualification for built-in 
products typically requires the use of more high-efficiency components. A conventional 
refrigerator-freezer, for example, typically requires use of a brushless DC condenser fan motor 
and a high-efficiency single-speed compressor to meet ENERGY STAR, whereas a built-in 
refrigerator-freezer generally requires use of brushless DC fan motors for both the condenser and 
evaporator, and a variable speed compressor. The cost of achieving ENERGY STAR based on 
these technical differences is estimated to be $43, as summarized in Table 2.2.1 below.a  DOE 
understands that the differential for achieving ENERGY STAR could be more or less, depending 
on the design details of the built-in product.

Built-in products can be built into the kitchen cabinetry in a way that is not possible for 
conventional products. Some of the design details associated with this unique utility can impact 
energy use. These products do not consume a different type of energy from conventional 
products. While a difference in the ability to achieve higher efficiency levels is noted, DOE does 
not have sufficient information to conclude that built-in products cannot meet efficiency levels 
that might be considered for future standards. DOE acknowledges that the cost of achieving 
higher efficiency levels is greater for built-in products. DOE has not sufficiently completed an 
assessment of the cost differences associated with built-ins (as compared to conventional 
products of the high-volume product classes) and for this reason has not made a determination at

Analysis of the TSD.

this preliminary stage regarding establishment of separate product classes for these products.  
DOE will work to complete this assessment as the rulemaking process progresses.    
2.2.2.2 Wine Storage Products 
 DOE received a number of comments on the subject of adding of wine storage products 
as a new product class covered under this rulemaking. Nearly all of these comments were in 
support of establishing a new product class for wine coolers. AHAM, ASAP, and PG&E all 
stated at the framework public meeting that DOE should include a separate product class for 
wine storage products. (AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at pp. 58-59; ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 46-47; PG&E, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at pp. 43-44) 
Specifically, these comments suggested that DOE create two separate product classes for wine 
storage products: those with manual defrost, and those with automatic defrost. EEI, Natural 
Resources Canada (NRCan), Whirlpool, Sub-Zero, and the Joint Comment expressed support for 
this position in their written comments as well. (EEI, No.13 at pp. 2-3;  NRCan, No. 16 at pp. 2-
3; Whirlpool, No. 17 at pp. 4-5; Sub-Zero, No. 9 at p. 3; Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 3)  
 
PG&E, however, modified its position in its written comment, stating that DOE should not 
establish new product classes for wine storage products at this time. The comment points out that 
the State of California already regulates these products, and that a Federal standard would 
supersede any State regulations. The comment further suggests that consideration is being given 
to strengthening the California energy standards for wine storage products and to expand the 
scope of product coverage, and that DOE introduction of a wine storage product class would 
limit California’s ability to take advantage of these energy savings opportunities. (PG&E, No. 14 
at pp. 1-2)  
 
DOE notes that the definitions of refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers in the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act (EPCA) do not include specification of temperature levels. DOE defined 
refrigerators as “designed for storage of food at temperatures above 32°F and below 39°F” in 
order to assure that refrigerator temperature levels are suitable for storage of food. (66 FR 57845, 
November 19, 2001) Wine coolers, which control for higher temperature levels, are therefore 
excluded from the product category of refrigerators. Because wine coolers are not defined either 
in the statute or regulations as part of this product category, or as a separate and independent 
product category, they are not covered products. Hence, DOE is not considering wine coolers as 
part of this rulemaking.  
2.2.3 Technology Assessment 
 As part of the market and technology assessment, DOE developed a list of technologies 
to consider for improving product efficiency. Initially, these technologies encompass all those 
that DOE believes are technologically feasible. DOE then removed those technology options 
whose energy consumption could not be adequately measured by the existing DOE test 
procedure. Finally, DOE also removed technologies that do not change or affect the energy 
efficiency metrics of these products before moving on to the screening analysis. Chapter 3 of the 
preliminary TSD includes the detailed list of all technology options identified for each type of 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-9
refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer. Comments on the selection of technologies 
identified in the framework document are discussed in section  2.3. 
2.3 SCREENING ANALYSIS 
 After DOE identified the technologies in the technology assessment that could potentially 
improve the energy efficiency of residential refrigeration products, DOE conducted the screening 
analysis. The purpose of the screening analysis is to evaluate the technologies to determine 
which options to consider further and which options to screen out. DOE consults with industry, 
technical experts, and other interested parties in developing a list of technologies for 
consideration. DOE then applied the screening criteria to determine which technologies are 
unsuitable for further consideration in this preliminary rulemaking. Chapter 4 of the preliminary 
TSD, the screening analysis, contains details on the criteria that DOE used. 
 
 Using the screening analysis DOE, in consultation with interested parties, examined 
whether various technologies described in chapter 3 of the TSD:  (1) are technologically feasible; 
(2) are practicable to manufacture, install, and service; (3) have an adverse impact on product 
utility or availability; and (4) have adverse impacts on health and safety. In the engineering 
analysis, DOE further considered the efficiency-enhancement options (i.e., technologies) that it 
did not screen out in the screening analysis.  
2.3.1 Screening Methodology 
 DOE received several comments regarding its methodology for screening technologies. 
The Joint Comment stated that DOE has been too quick to screen out technologies in previous 
rulemakings, that “manufacturers are much better at finding the lowest cost path to compliance 
than the Department”, and that DOE should review results of previous rulemakings to validate 
whether the methodology has been successful. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 4) The comment did 
not indicate what would constitute success of the methodology, nor did it specifically address the 
criteria used to evaluate the technologies. Whirlpool commented that the screening analysis 
should also examine whether various technologies are proprietary. If they are, they should be 
excluded as technology options from the engineering analysis. (Whirlpool, No. 17 at p.5) On the 
other hand, AHAM stated in both the framework public meeting and in written comments that it 
believes the screening criteria are appropriate. (AHAM, No. 11 at p.5 and Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 7 at p. 76) 
 
 DOE concurs with AHAM that the screening criteria are appropriate. The criteria are 
explicitly delineated in 10 CFR 430 subpart C appendix A section 4.(a)(4). DOE does not believe 
that a formal review of previous rulemakings to evaluate whether its screening methodology is 
“successful” is necessary. The time delay between the preliminary phase of the rulemaking and 
the effective date of the new standards is sufficiently long that some technologies appropriately 
screened out initially may be viable when the standards become effective. DOE is cognizant of 
the process used and the results achieved in previous rulemakings and has evaluated the 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-10
technologies in this rulemaking by rigorously applying the criteria in section  2.3 based on 
currently available information. Also, DOE acknowledges the need to exclude proprietary 
technologies from the engineering analysis and has done so where appropriate in this 
rulemaking. 
2.3.2 Alternative Foam-Blowing Agents 
 AHAM and Whirlpool both recommended that DOE add alternative foam-blowing agents 
to the list of technologies under consideration for the screening analysis. (AHAM, No. 11 at p.5; 
Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 5) DOE understands the intent of the comment to be that DOE should 
consider the impact of potential climate change legislation or direct EPA action limiting the use 
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as HFC-245fa. During investigation of technologies, DOE was 
not able to identify refrigerant blowing agent technology options that (1) have not been phased 
out in the past due to ozone depletion issues, and (2) provide better thermal performance than 
HFC-245fa, which is used extensively in the industry. Manufacturers confirmed during 
preliminary discussions that there are no available blowing agent options with better thermal 
performance.  
 
Manufacturers indicated during interviews that they have concerns about alternative 
foam-blowing agents which might have to be adopted as a result of potential climate change 
legislation regulating emissions of GHGs. HFC-245fa has a global warming potential (GWP) 
referenced to that of carbon dioxide (CO2) of about 1,000, but its conductivity is lower than all 
commonly known allowable alternative chemicals that are not GHGs. Hence, switching to a 
different foam-blowing agent will increase energy use of refrigeration products. Manufacturers 
expect that new legislation limiting the use of HFC blowing agents and refrigerants will be 
passed before the amended conservation standards for refrigerators goes into effect in 2014. For 
this reason, manufacturers have requested that DOE consider alternative foam-blowing agents in 
the analysis.  
 
 DOE points out that, because there are no alternative blowing agents that will 
improve efficiency, it is not appropriate to include this option in the list of technologies. An 
enforced transition to blowing agents with reduced global warming potential but higher thermal 
conductivity has the potential to make achieving high efficiency levels more difficult and more 
costly However, DOE cannot consider legislation that has not yet been enacted or rules that have 
not yet been established in determining its proposed standard levels before such legislation 
becomes law or before such rules have been established, regardless of the likelihood of these 
occurrences. Nevertheless, DOE acknowledges that climate change legislation could be enacted 
before the refrigeration products final rule is published. DOE also recognizes the additional 
challenge posed to the refrigeration products industry by potential limitations on HFC usage. For 
these reasons, the Department will consider conducting additional analyses addressing possible 
transition to alternative foam-blowing agents, to allow adjustment of the analysis results in a 
timely fashion in the case that such climate change legislation is enacted during the rulemaking 
process. Such analysis would consider the likely effect of increased energy consumption 
resulting from thermal conductivity increase of likely alternatives. This issue is discussed further 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-11
in sections  2.10 and  2.10.4 of this chapter, as well as in the manufacturing impact analysis in 
chapter 12.  
2.3.3 Alternative Refrigerants 
A number of stakeholders commented about the inclusion of alternative refrigerants as a 
technology option in the screening process. Both AHAM and Whirlpool stated that DOE should 
exclude hydrocarbon refrigerants because they are regulated by safety organizations such as 
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) that restrict the usage of these substances to quantities under 50 
grams due to flammability. (AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 117; Whirlpool, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 72-73) Alternatively, GE stated that there are processes in 
place at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to approve of hydrocarbon substances as 
safe for use as alternative refrigerants. (GE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 73) 
 
The dominant refrigerant currently used in the U.S. is HFC-134a. A possible replacement 
refrigerant is R-600a, isobutane. R-600a is used extensively throughout the world in residential 
refrigerators and has a better thermodynamic efficiency than HFC-134a. However, R-600a is a 
hydrocarbon and is flammable.  
 
DOE excluded consideration of R-600a in the engineering analysis because concerns 
regarding its acceptance by UL and under the EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy 
(SNAP) program have not been resolved. Current safety regulations limit the use of hydrocarbon 
refrigerants to quantities that are insufficient for most residential refrigeration applications. 
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) has established that no more than 50 g of isobutane can escape 
an appliance before requiring stringent safety testing, which essentially caps the allowable limit 
of R-600a at 50 g. This quantity is not enough for the typical residential refrigerator. Further, 
while thermodynamic efficiency of R-600a may be better than that of HFC-134a, it is not clear 
that the efficiency level of the alternative refrigerant is higher in practice. 
2.4 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS 
 The engineering analysis (chapter 5) establishes the relationship between the 
manufacturing production cost and the efficiency for each residential heating product. This 
relationship serves as the basis for cost/benefit calculations in terms of individual consumers, 
manufacturers, and the Nation. Chapter 5 discusses product classes DOE analyzed, the 
representative baseline units, the incremental efficiency levels, the methodology DOE used to 
develop the manufacturing production costs, the cost-efficiency curves, and the impact of 
efficiency improvements on the considered products. 
 
 In the engineering analysis, DOE evaluates a range of product efficiency levels and their 
associated manufacturing costs. The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the incremental 
manufacturer selling prices (MSPs) for a product that would result from increasing efficiency 
levels above the level of the baseline model in each product class. The engineering analysis 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-12
considers technologies not eliminated in the screening analysis. The LCC analysis uses the cost-
efficiency relationships developed in the engineering analysis. 
 
 DOE typically structures its engineering analysis around one of three methodologies: (1) 
the design-option approach, which calculates the incremental costs of adding specific design 
options to a baseline model; (2) the efficiency-level approach, which calculates the relative costs 
of achieving increases in energy efficiency levels without regard to the particular design options 
used to achieve such increases; and/or (3) the reverse-engineering or cost-assessment approach, 
which involves a “bottom-up” manufacturing cost assessment based on a detailed bill of 
materials derived from tear-downs of the product being analyzed. 
 
 For the preliminary analysis, DOE used a modified approach combining the design-
option approach and the efficiency-level approach. DOE conducted energy modeling and 
manufacturing cost modeling to determine the cost impact of groups of design options which 
combined can achieve defined efficiency levels. Reverse engineering of existing products was 
used to provide calibration of the manufacturing cost models. DOE selected several baseline and 
high-efficiency products on which to conduct teardowns, which also provided an initial 
indication of cost-efficiency relationships for certain product classes. This step involved 
physically disassembling commercially available products, consulting with outside experts, 
reviewing publicly available cost and performance information, and modeling equipment cost. 
Product data and energy testing were used to calibrate the energy models. Data requested from 
the industry was used to compare with data from the DOE analyses. The efficiency levels that 
DOE considered in the engineering analysis are attainable using technologies currently available 
on the market and incorporating these technologies into residential refrigeration products. 
Chapter 5 of the preliminary TSD describes the methodology that DOE used to perform the 
engineering analysis and derive the cost-efficiency relationship.   
 
 In response to the approach outlined in the framework document, DOE received 
comments regarding the following issues: (1) efficiency levels; (2) compartment temperatures; 
(3) product classes; and (4) manufacturing cost analysis.  Discussion of these issues is set forth 
below.  
2.4.1 Efficiency Levels 
 ACEEE and PG&E both stated that DOE should extend the cost-efficiency curves to 35 
percent lower energy than the federal standard. ACEEE mentioned that there are currently 
products on the market that exceed 30 percent below federal standards and that tax credits could 
increase the product volumes at these efficiency levels. (ACEEE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
7 at p. 105; PG&E, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 106) In response, Whirlpool stated that 
a 35 percent efficiency improvement is unrealistic and would be limited because of high costs. 
(Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 8) Additionally, Whirlpool and AHAM both recommended that DOE 
conduct analysis for an efficiency level between baseline and 15 percent because 15 percent 
represents a very significant change in efficiency and because the change in the test procedure 
(lower compartment temperatures for refrigerator-freezers) may make achieving the 15% level 
even more difficult for some products. (Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 8; AHAM, No. 11 at p. 7) 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-13
 
The development of cost-efficiency curves to higher efficiency levels does not dictate the 
level at which new standards will be set and provides fuller insight regarding the cost levels 
required to achieve higher efficiencies. This is important, in particular, to provide an 
understanding of the cost impact of a potential new ENERGY STAR level associated with each 
new baseline efficiency level. Therefore, DOE has extended the analysis up to efficiency levels 
of 35 percent or more, as appropriate. In response to the comments of AHAM and Whirlpool, 
DOE has also included a 10 percent efficiency level in the analysis. 
 
DOE also received comments from AHAM and Whirlpool regarding the definition of 
efficiency levels under the new test procedure.b Specifically, AHAM and Whirlpool stated, 
“These percentages should not be applied directly to baseline values obtained using the new test 
procedure. These percentages, when applied to baselines using the current test procedure are 
realistic.” (Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 7; AHAM, No. 11 at p. 7) DOE interprets these statements to 
mean that energy use for a percentage efficiency level would be defined to be equal to the new-
test baseline energy use minus the percentage efficiency level multiplied by the current-test 
baseline energy use. This definition is illustrated below in Eq. 2.4.1.  
 
  BaselineBaseline CTPANTPLevelEnergyNew u  Eq. 2.4.1 
 
Where: 
 
New Energy Level = energy consumption associated with efficiency level A, 
NTPBaseline =   baseline energy as calculated using the new test procedure, 
 A =   efficiency level, expressed as a percentage, and 
 CTPBaseline =  baseline energy as calculated using the current test procedure. 
 
For example, if the current baseline for a product is 500 kWh, and the new-test baseline 
energy use is 600 kWh, the 20 percent efficiency level would be 500 kWh, which is actually a 
16.7 percent reduction from 600 kWh.  
 
 DOE believes that this method is not appropriate as a definition for efficiency levels 
under the new test procedure because:  (1) it is confusing given that the energy use reduction 
would generally be less than the percent efficiency level; and (2) it is expected that a product at a 
given percentage efficiency level using the current test would exhibit the same percentage 
efficiency level using the new test.  Expressed in another way, an ENERGY STAR product 
should have similar sensitivity to the test procedure change as would a baseline energy product. 
DOE did not adopt the definitions suggested by AHAM and Whirlpool for these reasons. 
                                                 
b As described in Section 3 Market and Technology Assessment, DOE is proposing adopting provisions of the 
updated AHAM Standard HRF-1-2008 test procedure, which specifies new compartment temperatures that will 
increase energy test energy consumption for many product classes. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-14
2.4.2 Compartment Temperatures 
AHAM, GE, Sub-Zero, and Whirlpool all submitted comments stating that DOE should 
use the temperatures and volumes from the new test procedure when performing its engineering 
analysis. (AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 86 and No. 11 at p. 6; GE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 87; Sub-Zero, No. 9 at p. 4; and Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 7) 
 
DOE agreed with the manufacturers’ suggestion and conducted its engineering analysis 
using the new temperatures and volumes. 
2.4.3 Product Classes 
DOE received a number of comments regarding product classes and the representative 
units that were selected for its teardown analysis. AHAM commented on DOE selection of an 18 
ft3 product class 5 product, indicating that 17 ft3 or 19 ft3 sizes would be more appropriate, based 
on shipment data showing limited shipment of 18 ft3 products. AHAM also stated that the units 
selected for product classes 3, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 18 were representative of the typical volume for 
each class (AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. & at p. 98-99, No. 11 at p. 5) Whirlpool 
commented that the volumes of the proposed teardown units for the product classes in which it 
participates (3, 4, 5, and 7) are representative of the industry-wide offerings. (Whirlpool, No. 17 
at p. 6)  
 
DOE points out that the total volume of the product class 5 listed as 18 ft3 actually has a 
rated volume of 18.5 ft3, which should have been rounded up to 19 ft3. Also, DOE believes that 
products of this size would exhibit energy-use characteristics that are sufficiently similar to those 
of slightly larger or smaller sized units within the same product class. Hence, DOE continued its 
analysis of the 18.5 ft3 product. 
 
DOE received additional comments from AHAM and Whirlpool suggesting that the 
representative units for product class 5 should be French door bottom-mount models because 
they have higher heat-leakage than traditional bottom-mount units. (AHAM, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 7 at p. 67 and No. 11 at p. 4; Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 5) On the other hand, the 
Joint Comment suggested that DOE should not analyze product class 5 based solely on French 
Door models, stating that product types should not be chosen as the baseline simply because of 
higher inherent heat loss because this would lead to standards biased against efficiency and the 
grandfathering in of inefficient designs. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 3) 
 
DOE requested information during manufacturer interviews regarding the prevalence of 
French Door products within product class 5. The information received suggests that more than 
half of product class 5 shipments are products with French Doors. Hence, DOE considers this 
design feature more representative of the product class than single-door designs, and DOE has 
carried out the analysis based on designs having French Doors. 
 
Additionally, W.C. Wood Corporation, Ltd. (WC Wood) commented on DOE’s selection 
only of WC Wood products to represent ENERGY STAR products for product classes 9 and 10. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-15
WC Wood suggested that DOE also examine products from another manufacturer. (WC Wood, 
No. 8 at p. 1) WC Wood states that doing so would provide DOE with a broader selection from 
which to understand the current level of freezer manufacturing technology. 
 
DOE acknowledges that analysis of product classes 9 and 10 could be limited if 
ENERGY STAR products from just one manufacturer were examined, so it procured and 
conducted reverse engineering analysis on similar-sized units made by another key manufacturer 
of these products. 
2.4.4 Manufacturing Cost Analysis 
DOE received several comments regarding the manufacturing cost analysis. The Joint 
Comment, NRDC, and PG&E all stated that DOE should review the accuracy of its cost-
modeling methods from previous rulemakings, in order to identify and address inaccurate cost 
assumptions so that such inaccuracies are not incorporated in the refrigerator cost models for this 
rulemaking. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 4; NRDC, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at pp. 93-
94; PG&E, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at p. 94) Specifically, the Joint Comment states that 
DOE should account for the increased production levels and reduction of the learning curve 
associated with producing higher efficiency units. 
 
Thorough review of the accuracy of cost modeling of past rulemakings is beyond the 
scope of this rulemaking. DOE recognizes the need for accuracy in determination of the cost of 
achieving higher efficiency levels. To that end, DOE refrains from making or using cost 
projections that cannot be verified based on current information, as well as from making 
estimates that cannot be substantiated. DOE recognizes that this leads inevitably to cost estimates 
that may be high after a standard takes effect. However, the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007 (EISA) modified EPCA to require that not later than 6 years after the issuance of 
any final rule establishing or amending a standard, DOE shall publish either a determination that 
standards for the product do not need to be amended or a notice of proposed rulemaking 
including new proposed standards. (42 U.S.C. 6295, section 325 (m)) Hence, if the cost-
effectiveness of higher efficiency standards improves significantly, the energy conservation 
standards can be adjusted in a subsequent rulemaking. 
2.5 MARKUPS TO DETERMINE PRODUCT PRICE 
 DOE used markups to convert the manufacturer selling prices estimated in the 
engineering analysis to customer prices, which then were used in the life-cycle cost (LCC) and 
payback period (PBP) and manufacturer impact analyses. DOE calculates markups for baseline 
products (baseline markups) and for more efficient products (incremental markups). The 
incremental markup relates the change in the manufacturer sales price of higher-efficiency 
models (the incremental cost increase) to the change in the retailer or distributor sales price.  
 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-16
 To develop markups, DOE identifies how the products are distributed from the 
manufacturer to the customer. After establishing appropriate distribution channels, DOE relied 
on economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources to define how prices are 
marked up as the products pass from the manufacturer to the customer. See Chapter 6 for details 
on the development of markups. 
2.6 ENERGY USE CHARACTERIZATION  
 The energy use characterization, which assesses the energy savings potential from higher 
efficiency levels, provides the basis for the energy savings values used in the LCC and 
subsequent analyses. Studies show that measurements of field energy use often vary 
considerably from the rated usage as determined by the DOE test procedure. To determine the 
field energy use by products that would meet possible energy efficiency standards, DOE used 
data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s 2005 Residential Energy Consumption 
Survey (RECS).1,c RECS is a national sample survey of housing units that collects statistical 
information on the consumption of and expenditures for energy in housing units along with data 
on energy-related characteristics of the housing units and occupants. DOE used RECS to 
estimate the field energy usage of standard-sized refrigerator-freezers and freezers on a 
representative sample of housing units using these products. But DOE did not use RECS for 
compact refrigerators and freezers because a large fraction of these products are used outside the 
residential sector. 
 
AHAM and Whirlpool expressed opposition to using RECS data for the energy use 
characterization. (AHAM, No. 11 at p. 8; Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 9) They stated that the RECS 
data were collected in 2005 and may not be representative of the quickly changing refrigeration 
market. DOE uses the RECS to characterize energy use of refrigeration products because this 
survey is the only source that provides a nationally-representative household sample that 
includes estimates of energy use by refrigeration products. RECS also provides enough 
information to establish the type (i.e., product class) of refrigeration product used in each 
household. Changes in the refrigeration market are not an important factor because DOE’s 
approach provides a basis for estimating what the energy consumption would be if a household 
purchased a new and different product from the one they owned in 2005. As noted previously, 
DOE did not use RECS for compact refrigerators and freezers because a large fraction of these 
products are used outside the residential sector. 
 
EEI stated that units in unconditioned areas are more likely to have low energy usage 
during the winter season and higher energy usage during the summer season. (EEI, No. 13 at p. 
4) Although RECS does not report the precise location of the refrigerator, it does identify 
whether a household has a second refrigerator. For those households with two refrigerators, DOE 
estimated that the second unit is located in either the garage or the basement. DOE accounted for 
                                                 
c This is the most recent RECS. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-17
the operating conditions of units located in such unconditioned areas in its calculation of the 
energy use of second refrigerators. 
 
EEI stated that DOE should be careful when estimating the energy usage of compact 
equipment, especially since these units are more likely to be shut off most of the time (used only 
on social occasions) or used on a seasonal basis (e.g., college dormitories) compared to full-size 
units. (EEI, No. 13 at p. 4) Because DOE was not able to find suitable data on the field use of 
compact refrigerators and freezers, it used the DOE test procedure to calculate the annual energy 
use of products of different volume, and estimated the distribution of volumes in the field using 
model data from the California Energy Commission appliance database.2 
   
In calculating energy consumption of refrigeration products, DOE considered whether it 
would be appropriate to include a rebound effect (also called a take-back effect), which refers to 
the increased energy consumption resulting from actions that increase energy efficiency and 
reduce consumer costs. The rebound effect assumes that consumers give up some of the potential 
energy savings to receive more service. AHAM stated that the rebound effect does not impact the 
refrigeration market because most consumers have fixed kitchen space for a refrigeration unit, so 
purchasing a larger unit is not possible, and refrigerator size is a function of life stage, rather than 
operating cost. (AHAM, No. 11 at p. 8)  Whirlpool and EEI agreed with AHAM’s perspective. 
(Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 9; EEI, No. 13 at p. 4) DOE agrees that there is no evidence of a direct 
rebound effect for refrigeration products and it does not plan to include a rebound effect in its 
analysis. 
 
Chapter 7 of the preliminary TSD provides more detail about DOE’s approach for 
characterizing energy use of refrigeration products. 
2.7 LIFE-CYCLE COST AND PAYBACK PERIOD ANALYSES 
 New energy conservation standards affect products’ operating expenses—usually 
decreasing them—and consumer prices for the products—usually increasing them. DOE 
analyzed the net effect of amended standards on consumers by evaluating the net LCC. To 
evaluate the net LCC, DOE used the cost-efficiency relationship derived in the engineering 
analysis, along with the energy costs derived from the energy use characterization. Inputs to the 
LCC calculation include the installed cost of a product to the consumer (consumer purchase price 
plus installation cost), operating expenses (energy expenses and maintenance costs), the lifetime 
of the unit, and a discount rate. 
 
 Because the installed cost of a product typically increases while operating cost typically 
decreases in response to new standards, there is a time in the life of products having higher-than-
baseline efficiency when the net operating-cost benefit (in dollars) since the time of purchase is 
equal to the incremental first cost of purchasing the higher-efficiency product. The length of time 
required for products to reach this cost-equivalence point is known as the payback period (PBP). 
 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-18
Recognizing that several inputs to the determination of consumer LCC and PBP are 
either variable or uncertain, DOE conducted the LCC and PBP analysis by modeling both the 
uncertainty and variability in the inputs using Monte Carlo simulation and probability 
distributions. DOE developed LCC and PBP spreadsheet models incorporating both Monte Carlo 
simulation and probability distributions by using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets combined with 
Crystal Ball (a commercially available add-in program). 
 
 As described above in section 2.6, DOE developed samples of individual households that 
use standard-size refrigeration products. By developing household samples, DOE was able to 
perform the LCC and PBP calculations for each household to account for the variability in 
energy consumption and electricity price associated with each household. As noted above, DOE 
did not develop a household sample for compact refrigerators and freezers since a large number 
of such products are used in lodging, dormitories and other commercial establishments. DOE 
identified several other input values for estimating the LCC, including:  retail prices; discount 
rates; and product lifetimes. DOE characterized these values with probability distributions.  
  
 DOE developed discount rates separately for residential consumers and commercial 
consumers. Because some compact refrigerators and freezers are used in commercial 
applications, DOE developed commercial discount rates and for those commercial consumers 
that purchase compact refrigerators and freezers. DOE developed discount rates from estimates 
of the interest rate, or finance cost, applied to purchases of residential and commercial products. 
Following accepted principles of financial theory, the finance cost of raising funds to purchase 
such products can be interpreted as: (1) the financial cost of any debt incurred to purchase 
products, principally interest charges on debt; or (2) the opportunity cost of any equity used to 
purchase products, principally interest earnings on household equity.  
 
2.7.1 Retail Prices 
As described in section 2.5, DOE used markups to convert the manufacturer selling 
prices estimated in the engineering analysis to customer retail prices for the LCC and PBP 
analysis. The Joint Comment stated that analysis of past refrigerator standards has demonstrated 
that DOE has overestimated the increase in prices resulting from energy efficiency standards, 
and that DOE should revise its methodology or develop a correction factor for this rulemaking. 
(Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 5) DOE recognizes that every change in minimum energy 
conservation standards is an opportunity for manufacturers to make investments beyond what 
would be required to meet the new standards in order to minimize the costs or to respond to other 
factors. DOE’s manufacturing cost estimates, MIA interviews, and the GRIM analysis (which is 
conducted for DOE’s NOPR) seek to gauge the most likely industry response to proposed energy 
conservation standards. DOE’s analysis of responses must be based on currently available 
technology that will be non-proprietary when a rulemaking becomes effective, and thus cannot 
speculate on future product and market innovation.  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22

2.7.2 Energy Prices 
DOE used EIA’s energy price data to determine residential and commercial prices of 
electricity in 2007 in 13 geographic areas. DOE used projections of those energy prices from 
EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (AEO 2009) to estimate future energy prices.3 The Joint 
Comment recommended that DOE conduct a sensitivity analysis using a basket of other forecasts 
besides the AEO, as the AEO has estimated lower electricity prices than most other forecasts. 
(Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 6) DOE conducts sensitivity analysis using alternative AEO 
forecasts in addition to the AEO reference forecast. These alternative forecasts reflect different 
assumptions with respect to economic growth and other factors. In general, the range of AEO 
forecasts brackets long-run energy price forecasts made by other organizations. 
 
 The Joint Comment stated that DOE should consider consumers’ actual benefit of saving 
electricity at the margin rather than use the annual average cost of electricity. They noted that 
due to block rate structures used in some states, the last kWh of variable charges may be 
significantly higher than the annual average residential rate per kWh. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at 
p. 6 ) DOE did not use marginal energy prices in the current analysis because for a base load 
appliance such as residential refrigeration there is little difference between marginal and average 
prices. While it is true that many utilities use ascending block rate tariffs, the effect this has on 
the difference between marginal and average prices is offset by two other features of rate 
structures: first, residential consumers tend to pay relatively high fixed charges, which raises the 
average price relative to the marginal energy price; second, seasonal rates are also very common, 
with summer rates typically higher, and winter rates lower, than the average (this may be 
reversed in winter-peaking regions). As refrigerator energy use is not seasonal, over the year the 
rate differences average out. These arguments help explain why there is not a large difference 
between marginal and average prices. However, DOE bases its decision for which price to use on 
a review of the available data. In particular, analysis of the Edison Electric Institute Typical Bills 
and Average Rates Reports for summer and winter 2008 confirms that, averaged over the year 
and over a wide customer base as is appropriate for refrigerators; marginal and average rates are 
approximately equal.4,5 
2.7.3 Maintenance and Repair Costs 
 DOE considered expected changes to maintenance, repair, and installation costs for the 
products covered in this rulemaking. Typically, small incremental changes in product efficiency 
produce no, or only minor, changes in repair and maintenance costs over baseline efficiency 
products. Products having efficiencies that are significantly greater than baseline efficiencies can 
incur increased repair and maintenance costs since they are more likely to incorporate 
technologies that are new to the industry. 
 
 Whirlpool stated that maintenance, repair and installation (MRI) costs are, in part, a 
function of the complexity of the technology employed in the product and the experience level of 
the technicians repairing the product. Thus, if efficiency is improved through greater leverage of 
known technology, the assumption of little change in MRI costs is correct. However, if exotic 
new technologies are required to meet new efficiency levels, MRI costs could easily be double 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-20
current levels. (Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 10) DOE did not find data indicating increases in MRI 
costs associated with the efficiency levels considered in its analysis. 
2.7.4 Product Lifetime 
In DOE’s October 2005 draft technical report analyzing potential new amended energy 
conservation standards for residential refrigerator-freezers,6 an average product lifetime of 19 
years was estimated based on information in DOE’s 1995 TSD.7 Whirlpool commented that the 
September 2007 issue of Appliance magazine shows an average life for refrigerators of 14 years, 
a low of 10 years and a high of 18 years, and that this is consistent with Whirlpool's experience. 
(Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 10) The Joint Comment stated that 19 years is an accurate representation 
of the actual use of residential refrigerators; that many users continue to utilize their old 
refrigerators even after purchasing a new unit, while still others purchase used refrigerators to 
save up front costs; and that these factors work to increase the real product life such that DOE’s 
assumption is reasonable. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 6)   
 
DOE found that the basis for the lifetime estimates in the literature for refrigerators and 
freezers is uncertain. Therefore, for standard-sized refrigerator-freezers and freezers, DOE 
conducted an analysis of actual lifetime in the field using a combination of shipments data and 
responses in RECS on the age of the refrigeration products in the homes. As described in 
Chapter 8, this analysis yielded an estimate of mean age for standard-sized refrigerator-freezers 
of approximately 17 years and for standard-sized freezers of approximately 22 years. It also 
yielded a survival function that DOE incorporated as a probability distribution in its LCC 
analysis. For compact refrigerators and freezers, DOE based the product lifetime on a 
combination of historical shipments, historical saturations in the housing stock, and historical 
saturations in the commercial building stock. As described in Chapter 8, this analysis yielded an 
estimate of mean age for compact refrigerators of 5 years and compact freezers of 7 years. 
2.7.5 Product Energy Efficiency Distribution in the Base Case 
To accurately estimate the share of consumers that would be affected by a standard at a 
particular efficiency level, DOE’s LCC and PBP analysis considered the projected distribution of 
product efficiencies that consumers purchase under the base case (i.e., the case without new 
energy efficiency standards). DOE relied on data submitted by AHAM to estimate the base case 
efficiency distributions for each of the product classes that were analyzed in the LCC and PBP 
analysis. With respect to the distribution of future product energy efficiency in the absence of 
new standards, Whirlpool and EEI stated that the ENERGY STAR and the Consortium for 
Energy Efficiency (CEE) programs are well known and widely utilized by retailers, utilities and 
some state governments as voluntary market transformation programs, and that DOE should 
consider the future impacts of these programs in its base case projection. (Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 
11; EEI, No. 13 at p. 4) DOE agrees that the above programs are likely to affect the market and it 
projected an increase in the market share of ENERGY STAR appliances in the coming years for 
its base case forecast. Chapter 8 of the preliminary TSD provides more detail about DOE’s 
approach for base case efficiency distributions.

2.8 NATIONAL IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 The national impact analysis assesses the net present value (NPV) of total consumer life-
cycle cost (LCC) and net energy savings (NES) to the Nation. DOE determined both the NPV 
and NES for the performance levels considered for the product classes analyzed. To make the 
analysis more accessible and transparent to all interested parties, DOE prepared a Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheet model to forecast NES and the national consumer economic costs and savings 
resulting from new standards. The spreadsheet model uses as inputs typical values (as opposed to 
probability distributions). To assess the effect of input uncertainty on NES and NPV results, 
DOE may conduct sensitivity analyses by running scenarios on specific input variables.  
2.8.1 Shipments Analysis 
 Forecasts of product shipments are needed to calculate the national impacts of standards 
on energy use, NPV, and future manufacturer cash flows. DOE developed shipment forecasts 
based on an analysis of key market drivers for each considered product. In DOE’s shipments 
model, shipments of products are driven by new construction as well as stock replacements. 
 
The shipments models take an accounting approach, tracking market shares of each 
product class and the vintage of units in the existing stock. Stock accounting uses product 
shipments as inputs to estimate the age distribution of in-service product stocks for all years. The 
age distribution of in-service product stocks is a key input to calculations of both the NES and 
NPV, because operating costs for any year depend on the age distribution of the stock.  
 
 Chapter 9 of the preliminary TSD provides additional details on the shipments analysis. 
 
Framework phase comments regarding the shipments analysis were limited to agreement 
by AHAM and manufacturers to support the data collection effort (e.g. AHAM, No. 11 at p. 9), 
and statements highlighting the success of voluntary programs such as ENERGY STAR and 
CEE (e.g. Whirlpool, No. 17 at p.11).  
2.8.2 Efficiency Scenarios and Trends 
 Several of the inputs for determining NES and NPV depend on the product efficiency. 
DOE developed efficiency trends for the base case and standards cases. These trends specify the 
average annual historical and forecasted shipments-weighted product efficiencies. 
 
 In the framework document, DOE proposed to use a roll-up efficiency scenario in 
developing its forecasts of efficiency trends after standards take effect. Under a roll-up scenario, 
all products that perform at levels below a prospective standard are moved, or rolled-up, to the 
minimum performance level allowed under the standard. The distribution of products that meet 
the higher efficiency standard levels is unaffected.  
 
The Joint Comment stated that historical data are likely to demonstrate that the roll-up 
scenario bears no resemblance to the historical record and should be dropped from the analysis. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-22
It added that markets may respond with a very temporary situation where nearly all products just 
meet a new standards, but that it does not take long for a new distribution of efficiency 
performance above a new standard to emerge. The Joint Comment stated that over the analysis 
timeframe, a “shift” scenario is the dominant effect, and DOE should model a shift scenario that 
accounts for some time lag for the full shift effect to occur. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 7) DOE 
agrees that the historical record suggests that the likely market response to new standards is that 
baseline models will roll-up to the standard efficiency level but some fraction of shipments will 
be above the minimum. In developing the energy efficiencies forecasted over time for each of the 
standards cases, DOE used a “roll-up + ENERGY STAR” scenario to establish the distribution 
of efficiencies for the year that revised standards are assumed to become effective (i.e., 2014) 
and subsequent years. In this scenario, product efficiencies in the base case that did not meet the 
standard level under consideration would roll-up to meet the new standard level in 2014. DOE 
assumed that new criteria would be established for ENERGY STAR refrigeration products, and 
that such products would gradually gain a larger market share. The details of the approach are 
described in Chapter 10. 
2.8.3 National Energy Savings Analysis 
 The inputs for determining the national energy savings (NES) for each product analyzed 
are: (1) annual energy consumption per unit; (2) shipments; (3) product stock; (4) national 
energy consumption; and (5) site-to-source conversion factors. DOE calculated the national 
energy consumption by multiplying the number of units, or stock, of each product (by vintage, or 
age) by the unit energy consumption (also by vintage). DOE calculated annual NES based on the 
difference in national energy consumption for the base case (without new efficiency standards) 
and for each higher efficiency standard. DOE estimated energy consumption and savings based 
on site energy, and converted the electricity consumption and savings to source energy. 
Cumulative energy savings are the sum of the NES for each year. 
 
 The stock of a product is dependent on annual shipments and the lifetime of the product. 
DOE projected shipments under the base efficiency case and higher efficiency cases.  
2.8.4 Net Present Value Analysis 
 The inputs for determining net present value (NPV) are: (1) total annual installed cost; (2) 
total annual savings in operating costs; (3) a discount factor; (4) present value of costs; and (5) 
present value of savings. DOE calculated net savings each year as the difference between the 
base case and each standards case in total savings in operating costs and total increases in 
installed costs. DOE calculated savings over the life of each product, accounting for differences 
in yearly energy rates. DOE calculated NPV as the difference between the present value of 
operating cost savings and the present value of total installed costs. DOE used a discount factor 
based on real discount rates of 3% and 7% to discount future costs and savings to present values. 
 
The Joint Comment urged DOE to give primary weight to calculations based on the lower 
discount rate. The comment asserted that societal discount rates are the subject of extensive 
academic research, the weight of academic opinion is that the appropriate societal discount rate 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-23
is 3% or less, and NRDC and others have presented evidence to support the adoption of a 
societal discount rate in the range of 2 to 3% real. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 7)  
 
DOE notes that OMB Circular A-4 references an earlier Circular A-94, which states that 
a real discount rate of 7 percent should be used as a base case for regulatory analysis. The 7-
percent rate is an estimate of the average before-tax rate of return to private capital in the U.S. 
economy. It approximates the opportunity cost of capital and, according to Circular A-94, is the 
appropriate discount rate whenever the main effect of a regulation is to displace or alter the use 
of capital in the private sector. OMB revised Circular A-94 in 1992 after extensive internal 
review and public comment. OMB found that the average rate of return to capital remains near 
the 7-percent rate estimated in 1992. Circular A-4 also states that when regulation primarily and 
directly affects private consumption, a lower discount rate is appropriate. “The alternative most 
often used is sometimes called the social rate of time preference…the rate at which ‘society’ 
discounts future consumption flows to their present value.”8 It suggests that the real rate of return 
on long-term government debt may provide a fair approximation of the social rate of time 
preference, and states that over the last 30 years, this rate has averaged around 3 percent in real 
terms on a pre-tax basis. It concludes that “for regulatory analysis, [agencies] should provide 
estimates of net benefits using both 3 percent and 7 percent.”9 Consistent with OMB guidance 
DOE did not give primary weight to results derived using a 3-percent discount rate. 
 
 DOE calculated increases in total installed costs as the difference in total installed cost 
between the base case and standards case (i.e., once the standards take effect). Because the more 
efficient products bought in the standards case usually cost more than products bought in the 
base case, cost increases appear as negative values in the NPV. 
 
 DOE expressed savings in operating costs as decreases associated with the lower energy 
consumption of products bought in the standards case compared to the base efficiency case. 
Total savings in operating costs are the product of savings per unit and the number of units of 
each vintage that survive in a given year. 
 
 The national impacts analysis examines the potential economic impacts of alternative 
standard levels on consumers who purchase the products that meet each standard level. The Joint 
Comment stated that the electricity price mitigation effects of new standards on refrigeration 
products should be documented and the value of reduced electricity bills to all consumers 
quantified as a benefit. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 6) DOE investigated the possibility of 
estimating the impact of specific standard levels on electricity prices in its rulemaking for 
general service fluorescent lamps and incadescent reflector lamps.10 Whereas natural gas markets 
exhibit a fairly simple chain of agents from producers to consumers, the power industry is a 
complex mix of fuel suppliers, producers and distributors. While the distribution of electricity is 
regulated everywhere, its institutional structure varies, and upstream components are more 
complicated, with generation being priced using different methods across the country. For these 
and other reasons, accurate modeling of the response of electricity prices to a decrease in 
residential-sector demand due to standards is problematic. Thus, DOE does not plan to estimate 
the value of potentially reduced electricity costs for all consumers associated with revised 
standards. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-24
 
 Chapter 10 of the preliminary TSD provides additional details regarding the national 
impacts analysis. 
2.9 LIFE-CYCLE COST SUBGROUP ANALYSIS 
 The LCC subgroup analysis evaluates economic impacts on selected groups of consumers 
who might be adversely affected by a change in the national energy conservation standards for 
the considered products. DOE evaluates impacts on particular subgroups of consumers primarily 
by analyzing the LCC impacts and PBP for those particular consumers. 
 
 AHAM stated that DOE should consider low-income households as a consumer 
subgroup, since refrigerators are not optional for consumers, and thus the impact of price 
increase on low-income and fixed-income consumers may be more pronounced than for products 
that are more discretionary. (AHAM, No. 11 at p. 9) DOE intends to evaluate impacts of 
standards on low-income and fixed-income (i.e., senior) consumers. 
 
 DOE will use the LCC spreadsheet model to evaluate impacts on consumer subgroups. 
DOE can analyze the LCC for any subgroup by applying the LCC spreadsheet model to only that 
subgroup. DOE is particularly sensitive to increases in the consumer price of the considered 
products, and seeks to avoid a negative economic impact on any identified consumer subgroup.  
 
 The Joint Comment stated that if the Department insists on analyzing sub-groups in the 
LCC analysis, it should not only quantify the effects on those that are more negatively affected, 
but also consider those sub-groups that are more positively affected, such as those that rent 
housing and have no choice in refrigerator efficiency, yet are forced to pay the energy bills. 
(Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 7) It is unclear whether renters would be positively affected by 
revised standards, as the extent to which property owners (the purchasers of refrigerators in most 
cases) would pass on the higher cost of more-efficient products to tenants in the rent is uncertain. 
Therefore, DOE does not plan to analyze renters as a sub-group. 
2.10 PRELIMINARY MANUFACTURER IMPACT ANALYSIS  
 DOE performed a preliminary manufacturer impact analysis (MIA) to start to estimate 
the financial impact of higher energy conservation standards on manufacturers of residential 
refrigeration products, and calculate the impact of such standards on employment and 
manufacturing capacity. The MIA has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The quantitative 
part of the MIA relies on the government regulatory impact model (GRIM), an industry-cash-
flow model customized for this industry. The GRIM inputs are information regarding the 
industry cost structure, shipments, and revenues. This includes information from many of the 
analyses described above, such as manufacturing costs and prices from the engineering analysis 
and shipments forecasts. The key GRIM output is the industry net present value (NPV). Different 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-25
sets of assumptions (scenarios) will produce different results. The qualitative part of the MIA 
addresses factors such as equipment characteristics, characteristics of particular firms, and 
market and equipment trends, and includes assessment of the impacts of standards on subgroups 
of manufacturers. The complete preliminary MIA is described in chapter 12 of the preliminary 
TSD. 
 
 DOE will conduct the MIA in this rulemaking in three phases, and will further tailor the 
analytical framework for the MIA based on comments from interested parties. In Phase I, DOE 
creates an industry profile to characterize the industry and identify important issues that require 
consideration. In Phase II, DOE prepares an industry cash-flow model and an interview 
questionnaire to guide subsequent discussions. In Phase III, DOE interviews manufacturers, and 
assesses the impacts of standards both quantitatively and qualitatively. DOE assesses industry 
and subgroup cash flow and NPV using the GRIM. DOE then assesses impacts on competition, 
manufacturing capacity, employment, and regulatory burden based on manufacturer interview 
feedback and discussions.  
 
 Until recently, DOE reported MIA results in its standards rulemakings only during the 
NOPR phase of the rulemaking. However, DOE is now evaluating and reporting preliminary 
MIA information in this preliminary analysis. DOE gathered this information during the 
preliminary manufacturer interviews conducted for the engineering analysis.  
 
 In response to the process outlined in the framework document for conducting the MIA, 
DOE received comments on the cumulative regulatory burden faced by the industry as a whole 
and by small, niche manufacturers in particular. Specifically, manufacturers and trade 
associations expressed concern over potential climate change legislation that would regulate or 
eliminate the use of HFCs, the regulation of refrigerants through the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), and the regulation of potential alternative refrigerants through safety standards 
from organizations such as UL.  
 
 AHAM, GE, and Whirlpool all stated that DOE should consider the effects of potential 
climate change legislation within its analyses. All three organizations also believe that 
regulations restricting use of refrigerants and foam-blowing agents could be enacted by EPA in 
the absence of climate change legislation. This could present a major problem to manufacturers 
because the use of the most likely alternative refrigerant, R-600a, is currently restricted, due to 
safety concerns, by UL. (AHAM, No. 11 at p. 9, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at pp. 116-117 
and at pp. 182-183; GE, No. 15 at pp. 1-2; and Whirlpool, No. 17 at pp. 11-12)  
 
DOE agrees that potential climate change legislation and potential regulations and 
restrictions by EPA would present significant challenges to refrigeration products manufacturers. 
If these kinds of regulations were passed before the final rule for refrigeration products, DOE 
would consider them in its analysis of cumulative regulatory burden during this rulemaking. 
However, DOE cannot, either when determining new energy conservation standards or when 
considering the cumulative regulatory impact of such standards, factor unenacted legislation or 
rules that have not yet been finalized into its analysis. DOE recognizes the substantial impact that 
climate change and other regulations would pose for the refrigeration products industry. DOE 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-26
will consider conducting analyses addressing the impacts of the use of alternative refrigerants 
and foam-blowing agents possibly required by such legislation or regulations, in order to be 
prepared to adjust analysis results appropriately should such climate change legislation be 
enacted or rules be finalized during the rulemaking process. This issue is discussed also in 
section  2.3.2 and in chapter 12. 
 
As part of the preliminary MIA, DOE asked manufacturers about the potential impacts of 
amended energy conservation standards on their business, employment levels, market share, and 
competitive positions within the marketplace. Manufacturers stated that conversion costs are a 
concern and they anticipate that significant product modifications resulting in the need for new 
production facilities will drive production outside of the U.S. and substantially lower domestic 
employment levels. Additionally, manufacturers expressed some concern about competitive 
position and potential industry consolidation as a result of amended energy conservation 
standards. As part of the NOPR phase of the rulemaking, DOE will further analyze these 
concerns and seek further comments from manufacturers about conversion costs and 
profitability. DOE will then estimate both the qualitative and quantitative impacts on the 
refrigeration products industry.  
 
 The following is an overview of the information DOE will collect and the analysis that 
will be conducted during the MIA. For more detail, see chapter 12 of the preliminary TSD.  
2.10.1 Industry Cash-Flow Analysis 
 The industry cash-flow analysis relies primarily on the GRIM. DOE uses the GRIM to 
analyze the financial impacts of more stringent energy conservation standards on the industry 
that produces the products covered by the standard. The GRIM analysis uses many factors to 
determine annual cash flows from a new standard: annual expected revenues; manufacturer 
costs, including cost of goods sold, depreciation, research and development, selling, general, and 
administrative expenses; taxes; and conversion capital expenditures. DOE compares the results 
against base-case projections that involve no new standards. The financial impact of new 
standards is then the difference between the two sets of discounted annual cash flows. Other 
performance metrics, such as return on invested capital, are also available from the GRIM. For 
more information on the industry cash-flow analysis, refer to chapter 12 of the preliminary TSD. 
2.10.2 Manufacturer Subgroup Analysis  
 Industry cost estimates are not adequate to assess differential impacts among subgroups 
of manufacturers. For example, small and niche manufacturers, or manufacturers whose cost 
structure differs significantly from the industry average, could experience a more negative 
impact from the imposition of standards. Ideally, DOE would consider the impact on every firm 
individually; however, since this usually is not possible, DOE typically uses the results of the 
industry characterization to group manufacturers exhibiting similar characteristics. 
 
 DOE outlined the process it uses to establish manufacturer subgroups in the framework 
document and sought comment from interested parties on any potential subgroups within the 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-27
refrigeration products industries. AHAM and Whirlpool both commented that small, niche 
manufacturers should be considered because they have less access to the resources needed to 
develop, implement, and market newer technologies, such as alternative refrigerants. (AHAM, 
No. 11 at p. 9; Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 11) 
 
 Currently, DOE is characterizing the impacts on residential refrigeration products on the 
residential refrigeration industry. DOE did not identify any manufacturer subgroups within the 
industry other than small manufacturers. DOE will consider the possibility of small businesses 
being affected by the promulgation of amended energy conservation standards for residential 
refrigeration products. DOE identified a handful of small businesses within the industry in 
chapter 3 of the preliminary TSD. During the manufacturer interview process conducted as part 
of the NOPR, DOE will discuss the potential subgroups and subgroup members it has identified 
for the analysis. DOE will encourage the manufacturers to recommend subgroups or 
characteristics that are appropriate for the subgroup analysis. For more detail on the 
manufacturer subgroup analysis, see chapter 12 of the preliminary TSD.  
2.10.3 Competitive Impacts Assessment 
 DOE must also consider whether a new standard is likely to reduce industry competition, 
and the Attorney General must determine the impacts, if any, of any reduced competition. DOE 
will make a determined effort to gather and report firm-specific financial information and 
impacts. The competitive impacts assessment will focus on assessing the impacts on smaller 
manufacturers. DOE will base this assessment on manufacturing cost data and information 
collected from interviews with manufacturers. The manufacturer interviews will focus on 
gathering information to help assess asymmetrical cost increases to some manufacturers, 
increased proportion of fixed costs potentially increasing business risks, and potential barriers to 
market entry (e.g., proprietary technologies). The NOPR will be submitted to the Attorney 
General for a review of the impacts of standards on competition. The Attorney General’s 
comments on the proposed rule will be considered in preparing the final rule. 
2.10.4 Cumulative Regulatory Burden 
 DOE recognizes and seeks to mitigate the overlapping effects on manufacturers of new or 
revised DOE standards and other regulatory actions affecting the same equipment. DOE will 
analyze and consider the impact on manufacturers of multiple, product-specific regulatory 
actions. Based on its own research and discussions with manufacturers, DOE identified several 
regulations relevant to residential refrigeration products, including potential climate change and 
greenhouse gas legislation. 
 
 DOE outlined the cumulative regulatory burden process in the framework document and 
sought comment from interested parties on any additional regulations facing the residential 
refrigeration products industry. In response to the cumulative regulatory burden discussion in the 
framework document, AHAM, Whirlpool, and GE all commented that DOE should consider the 
effect of potential climate change regulation. (AHAM, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 7 at pp. 
116-117 and pp. 182-183, No. 11 at p. 9; Whirlpool, No. 17 at pp. 11-12; GE, No. 15 at pp. 1-2)  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-28
 
As stated in section  2.3.2, DOE cannot consider in its cumulative regulatory burden 
analysis any legislation that has not yet been enacted or any new rules that have not been 
finalized. However, DOE recognizes the impact that such legislation or rules could have to 
DOE’s rulemaking schedule and the challenge it presents to manufacturers. For these reasons, 
DOE will consider conducting additional analyses, addressing use of alternative foam-blowing 
agents, to allow adjustment of the analysis results in the case that such climate change legislation 
is enacted during the rulemaking process. 
 
DOE identified several other regulations relevant to refrigeration products manufacturers 
during interviews conducted as part of the manufacturing impact analysis. These issues included 
regulations from the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), new DOE test procedures 
for residential refrigeration products, amended energy conservation standards for other products 
manufactured by refrigeration products manufacturers, state energy conservation standards, and 
international energy conservation standards. All of these regulations and the potential climate 
change legislation are described further in Chapter 12. 
 
2.10.5 Preliminary Results for the Manufacturer Impact Analysis 
 As part of the preliminary MIA, DOE discussed potential impacts of amended energy 
conservation standards with manufacturers of residential refrigeration products. These 
discussions took place during the interviews DOE conducted for the engineering analysis. The 
interviews provided valuable information that DOE will use to evaluate the impacts of amended 
energy conservation standards on manufacturers’ cash flows, manufacturing capacities, and 
employment levels in subsequent phases of the MIA. DOE discusses its findings from the 
preliminary MIA interviews in the executive summary and in chapter 12 of the preliminary TSD. 
2.11 UTILITY IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 The utility impact analysis includes an analysis of the effect of new energy conservation 
standards on the electric and the gas utility industries. For this analysis, DOE adapted NEMS, 
which is a large multi-sectoral, partial-equilibrium model of the U.S. energy sector that the EIA 
has developed throughout the past decade, primarily for preparing EIA’s AEO. In previous 
rulemakings, a variant of NEMS (currently termed NEMS-BT, BT referring to DOE’s Building 
Technologies Program), was developed to better address the specific impacts of an energy 
conservation standard. 
 
 NEMS, which is available in the public domain, produces a widely recognized baseline 
energy forecast for the United States through the year 2030. The typical NEMS outputs include 
forecasts of electricity sales, prices, and electric generating capacity. DOE conducts the utility 
impact analysis as a scenario that departs from the latest AEO reference case. In other words, the 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-29
energy savings impacts from amended energy conservation standards are modeled using NEMS-
BT to generate forecasts that deviate from the AEO reference case. 
2.12 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 The intent of the environmental assessment is to fulfill requirements to properly quantify 
and consider the environmental effects of all new Federal rules. The primary environmental 
effects of energy conservation standards for heating products would be reduced power plant 
emissions resulting from reduced consumption of electricity. DOE will assess these 
environmental effects by using NEMS-BT to provide key inputs to its analysis. The portion of 
the environmental assessment that will be produced by NEMS-BT considers carbon dioxide 
(CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and mercury (Hg). 
 
 DOE has preliminarily determined that SO2 emissions from affected Electric Generating 
Units (EGUs) are subject to nationwide and regional emissions cap and trading programs that 
create uncertainty about standard’s impact on SO2 emissions.  Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets 
an annual emissions cap on SO2 for all affected EGUs.  SO2 emissions from 28 eastern States 
and the District of Columbia (D.C.) are also limited under the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR, 
published in the Federal Register on May 12, 2005. 70 FR 25162 (May 12, 2005), which creates 
an allowance-based trading program that will gradually replace the Title IV program in those 
States and D.C.. (The recent legal history surrounding CAIR is discussed below.) The attainment 
of the emissions caps is flexible among EGUs and is enforced through the use of emissions 
allowances and tradable permits.  The standard could lead EGUs to trade allowances and 
increase SO2 emissions that offset some or all SO2 emissions reductions attributable to the 
standard.  DOE is not certain that there will be reduced overall SO2 emissions from the 
standards.  The NEMS-BT modeling system that DOE plans to use to forecast emissions 
reductions currently indicates that no physical reductions in power sector emissions would occur 
for SO2,.  However, remaining uncertainty prevents DOE from estimating SO2 reductions from 
the standards at this time. 
 
 Even though DOE is not certain that there will be reduced overall emissions from the 
standard, there may be an economic benefit from reduced demand for SO2 emission allowances. 
Electricity savings decrease the generation of SO2 emissions from power production, which can 
lessen the need to purchase SO2 emissions allowance credits, and thereby decrease the costs of 
complying with regulatory caps on emissions. 
 
 With regard to NOX emissions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued 
the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) on March 10, 2005. 70 FR 25162 (May 12, 2005). On July 
11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued its 
decision in North Carolina v. Environmental Protection Agency, in which the court vacated the 
CAIR and remanded to EPA to promulgate a rule consistent with the court’s opinion. 531 F.3d 
896 (D.C. Cir. 2008). If left in place, the CAIR would have permanently capped emissions of 
NOX in 28 eastern States and the District of Columbia. However, upon consideration of petitions 
for review, the D.C. Circuit decided on December 23, 2008 to allow CAIR to remain in effect 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-30
until it is replaced by a rule consistent with the court's earlier opinion. North Carolina v. 
EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 550 F.3d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Therefore, DOE’s 
Environmental Analysis is based on CAIR, pending revision by EPA. See 
www.epa.gov/cleanairinterstaterule.  
 
 Similarly, for Hg emissions, the EPA issued the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR). 70 FR 
28606 (May 18, 2005). CAMR would have permanently capped emissions of mercury for new 
and existing coal-fired power plants in all States by 2010. However, on February 8, 2008, the 
D.C. Circuit issued its decision in New Jersey v. Environmental Protection Agency, in which the 
D.C. Circuit, among other actions, vacated the CAMR. 517 F.3d  574 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  EPA has 
decided to develop emissions standards for power plants under the Clean Air Act (Section 112), 
consistent with the D.C. Circuit’s opinion on the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR).  See 
http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/pdfs/certpetition_withdrawal.pdf.  Pending EPA's 
forthcoming revisions to the rule, DOE is excluding the CAMR from its Environmental 
Analysis.  
 
 Both with and without emissions caps, decreased power production at emitting power 
plants can have environmental-related economic benefits. When NOX and Hg emissions are 
subject to emissions caps, electricity demand reductions may result in incremental changes in the 
prices of emissions allowances in cap-and-trade emissions markets rather than physical 
emissions reductions. When there are physical emissions reductions, economic benefits can 
accrue from the decreased environmental damage from lower emissions. Therefore, both with 
and without emissions caps, standards can produce an environmental-related economic benefit in 
the form of lower prices for emissions allowance credits or a monetary value of the economic 
benefits of lower emissions. Therefore in addition to potential physical emissions reductions, 
DOE will examine the potential monetary value of NOX and Hg benefits that may arise from a 
standard.  DOE has used updated estimate(s) of the value of avoided NOX and Hg emissions in 
recent DOE efficiency standards rulemakings.  These estimates are summarized in the 
environmental assessment in the preliminary TSD. 
 
 The results for the environmental assessment are similar to NEMS results as published in 
the AEO. These results include power sector emissions for SO2, NOX, Hg, and CO2 in five-year 
forecasted increments. The outcome of the analysis for each analyzed standard level will be 
reported as a deviation from the AEO 2009 reference (base) case. 
 
 EEI stated that DOE should account for the rise in renewable portfolio standards and the 
possibility of an upcoming CO2 cap and trade program, which would reduce the amount of CO2 
produced per kWh generated. (EEI, No. 13 at p. 5) As stated above, DOE utilizes the most recent 
forecasts from EIA’s NEMS to estimate the future mix of power generation sources. EIA 
accounts for policies that have been enacted at the time of its analysis, including renewable 
portfolio standards and regional cap and trade programs, and DOE believes that this approach 
provides the most reliable basis for estimating future power sector emissions. 
 
 NRDC stated that since climate change legislation is extremely likely to be enacted by 
2014, which would place limits on CO2 levels, the analyses should monetize the value of avoided 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-31
CO2. (NRDC, No. 7 at p. 118) The Joint Comment agreed, stating that the analyses cannot be 
considered accurate descriptions of economic justification for standard setting until a realistic 
value for avoided CO2 emissions is included. It suggested that DOE utilize carbon values from 
EIA’s analysis of climate legislation proposed in Congress. (Joint Comment, No. 10 at p. 8) 
Whirlpool argued against using values for avoided CO2 in DOE’s analysis, stating that projected 
market values are too uncertain. (Whirlpool, No. 17 at p. 13) DOE has used updated estimate(s) 
of the value of avoided CO2 emissions in recent efficiency standards rulemakings.  These 
estimates are summarized in the environmental assessment in the preliminary TSD. 
  
 EEI stated that the environmental assessment should consider emissions created during 
equipment production and delivery, taking account of emissions where the appliances are 
produced. (EEI, No. 13 at p. 5) EPCA directs DOE to consider the projected amount of energy 
savings likely to result directly from imposition of the standard. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) As 
emissions created during appliance production and delivery are not considered a direct impact of 
standards, DOE does not plan to include such emissions in its analysis. 
 
 For more detail on the environmental assessment, refer to the environmental assessment 
report in the preliminary TSD. 
2.13 EMPLOYMENT IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 The imposition of standards can affect employment both directly and indirectly. Direct 
employment impacts are changes, produced by new standards, in the number of employees at 
plants that produce the covered products and at the affiliated distribution and service companies. 
DOE evaluated direct employment impacts in the manufacturer impact analysis. Indirect 
employment impacts that occur because of the imposition of standards may result from 
consumers shifting expenditures between goods (the substitution effect) and from changes in 
income and overall expenditure levels (the income effect). DOE will utilize Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory’s impact of sector energy technologies (ImSET) model to investigate the 
combined direct and indirect employment impacts. The ImSET model, which was developed for 
DOE’s Office of Planning, Budget, and Analysis, estimates the employment and income effects 
energy-saving technologies produced in buildings, industry, and transportation. In comparison 
with simple economic multiplier approaches, ImSET allows for more complete and automated 
analysis of the economic impacts of energy conservation investments. 
2.14 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 
 In the NOPR stage, DOE will prepare a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) pursuant to 
Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993, which 
is subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget. The RIA addresses the potential for non-
regulatory approaches to supplant or augment energy conservation standards in order to improve 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
2-32
the energy efficiency or reduce the energy consumption of the products covered under this 
rulemaking. 
 
 DOE recognizes that voluntary or other non-regulatory efforts by manufacturers, utilities, 
and other interested parties can substantially affect energy efficiency or reduce energy 
consumption. DOE will base its assessment on the actual impacts of any such initiatives to date, 
but also will consider information presented by interested parties regarding the impacts existing 
initiatives might have in the future. 
2.15 DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS FOR LOW-VOLUME PRODUCT 
CLASSES 
DOE conducted rigorous analysis of seven key product classes which represent over 90 
percent of refrigeration product shipments. This section addresses the treatment of low-volume 
product classes. As presented in Table 2.15.1 through Table 2.15.3 below, DOE proposes to 
develop energy conservation standards for these product classes by extrapolating from the results 
for the seven key product classes.  In this specific case of product class 3A, Figure 2.15.1 
illustrates that all-refrigerators with automatic defrost of this proposed product class appear to 
currently have a less stringent standard than refrigerator-freezers with top-mounted freezers—
both of these product types currently are part of product class 3. The plot shows that ENERGY 
STAR models categorized under product class 3 have a distinctly higher energy use than 
ENERGY STAR models that fall under the proposed product class 3A.

Proposed Approach to 
Development of Energy 
Conservation Standards 
Notes and Comments 
1 Reduction of standard if needed 
so that product class 1 energy 
use is no higher than energy use 
of product class 3. Otherwise 
no change.  
 
The product class 1 energy standard is currently roughly 
11% lower than the standard for product class 3.  
AHAM data show that product classes 1 and 2 accounted 
for 0.1% of shipments of refrigerators, refrigerator-
freezers, and freezers in 2007.  
1A Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as 
for product class 1. 
As discussed in section 5.7.4 of the Engineering Analysis 
(chapter 5), the baseline-efficiency energy use under the 
proposed test procedure for product class 1A is less than 
the energy use for product class 1. The future energy 
standard for product class 1A would likewise be less.  
2 Combine this product class 
with product class 1.   
The energy standards for product classes 1 and 2 are 
currently identical, and shipments of these products are 
very low. 
3A Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as 
for product class 3. 
The baseline-efficiency energy use under the proposed test 
procedure for product class 3A is less than the energy use 
for product class 3. The future energy standard for product 
class 3A would likewise be less. The current product class 
3 standard is less stringent for all-refrigerators than for 
top-mount refrigerator-freezers, as indicated by the 
availability only of all-refrigerators of this product class 
with efficiency level higher than 20% in the ENERGY 
STAR database (see Figure 2.15.1). Hence, all-
refrigerators are expected to achieve the same reduction in 
energy use with no reduction in cost-effectiveness. 
4 Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as 
for product class 7, with some 
consideration of adjustment of 
the slope of the energy/adjusted 
volume relationship. 
See section 5.4.2.3 of the Engineering Analysis (chapter 5) 
for a discussion of the investigation of the energy/adjusted 
volume slope. 
5A Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as 
for product class 5. 
 
6 Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as 
for product class 3.

Proposed Approach to Development of 
Energy Conservation Standards 
Notes and Comments 
8 Establish the standard with the same 
percentage adjustment as for product class 
10. 
Although product class 8 freezers are upright 
freezers, they have manual defrost, making 
them more similar to product class 10 
(primarily chest freezers with manual 
defrost) than product class 9 (upright freezers 
with automatic defrost). The current energy 
standard for product class 8 is also is much 
closer to that of product class 10 than 
product class 9. 
10A Establish the standard equal to the standard 
for product class 10 plus the automatic 
defrost differential of the energy standards 
for the two types of upright freezers (product 
class 9 and product class 8). 
This is the approach used in the exception 
granted to Electrolux when the company 
initially introduced an automatic defrost 
chest freezer.d

Proposed Approach to 
Development of Energy 
Conservation Standards 
Notes and Comments 
11A Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as for 
product class 11. 
The baseline-efficiency energy use under the proposed 
test procedure for product class 11A is less than the 
energy use for product class 11. The future energy 
standard for product class 11A would likewise be less. 
12 Combine this product class with 
product class 11. 
 
Product class 12 currently has a different energy 
standard than product class 11 (it is 20 to 25% higher, 
depending on volume), while for standard-size 
products, the manual defrost and partial automatic 
defrost products have the same energy standard 
(product classes 1 and 2).  The only product class 12 
products DOE is aware of have energy use about 30% 
below the standard (i.e. Microfridge MFR-3, Absocold 
ARD298C), suggesting that the product classes could 
be combined. 
13 Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as for 
product class 18. 
Large energy use reductions are not likely cost-
effective for these products because they have low 
production volume, hence the incremental cost 
relationship of compact freezers is more likely 
representative than that of product class 11.  
13A Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as for 
product class 13. 
Many existing product class 13 products are all-
refrigerators with automatic defrost. The Energy Star 
database has no product class 13 products which are 
top-mount rather than all-refrigerator. As with product 
class 3 and 3A, it is expected that achieving efficiency 
improvement for product class 13A will be no less 
cost-effective than for product class 13.  
14 
15 
Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as for 
product class 13. 
 
These product classes combined account for only 0.1% 
of shipments of refrigeration products according to 
AHAM data.  
16 
17 
Establish the standard with the 
same percentage adjustment as for 
product class 18.

CHAPTER 3.MARKET AND TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT   
3.1  INTRODUCTION  
This report provides a profile of the residential refrigerator and freezer product industries 
in the United States. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) developed the preliminary market 
and technology assessment presented in this chapter primarily from publicly available 
information. This assessment identifies the major manufacturers and their product characteristics, 
which form the basis for the engineering and the life­cycle cost (LCC) analyses. Present and past
industry structure and industry financial information help DOE in the process of conducting the 
manufacturer impact analysis. 
3.1.1  Product Definitions 
3.1.1.1  Refrigerators, Refrigerator­Freezers, and Freezers 
The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) establishes the product definitions for 
refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers as follows:1 
•  The term Refrigerator means an electric refrigerator and the term Refrigerator-freezer 
means an electric refrigerator­freezer.  
•  Electric refrigerator means a cabinet designed for the refrigerated storage of food at 
temperatures above 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and below 39 °F, configured for general 
refrigerated food storage, and having a source of refrigeration requiring single phase, 
alternating current electric energy input only. An electric refrigerator may include a 
compartment for freezing and storage of food at temperatures below 32 °F, but does not 
provide a separate low temperature compartment designed for the freezing and storage of 
food at temperatures below 8 °F. 
•  Electric refrigerator-freezer means a cabinet which consists of two or more 
compartments with at least one of the compartments designed for the refrigerated storage 
of food at temperatures above 32 °F. and with at least one of the compartments designed 
for the freezing and storage of food at temperatures below 8 °F. which may be adjusted 
by the user to a temperature of 0 °F. or below. The source of refrigeration requires single 
phase, alternating current electric energy input only. 
•  Compact refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer means any refrigerator, 
refrigerator­freezer or freezer with total volume less than 7.75 ft3 (220 L) and 36 inches 
(0.91 meters) or less in height. 
•  Freezer means a cabinet designed as a unit for the freezing and storage of food at 
temperatures of 0 °F or below, and having a source of refrigeration requiring single 
phase, alternating current electric energy input only.

3.1.1.2  Wine Coolers 
DOE amended the definition of “electric refrigerator”, effective December 19, 2001, to 
include a maximum temperature of the fresh food storage compartment, and to exclude certain 
appliances whose physical configuration makes them unsuitable for general storage of perishable 
foods.2 Because wines coolers maintain storage temperature above 39 ºF, they are exempted 
from existing refrigerator product classifications and are not required to meet minimum 
efficiency standards. 
3.2  MARKET ASSESSMENT 
3.2.1  Product Classes 
3.2.1.1  Product Classes Listed in the CFR 
The CFR establishes the product classes for refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and 
freezers.3 As per the CFR, there are 18 product classes. The product classes are based on the 
following characteristics: type of unit (refrigerator, refrigerator­freezer, or freezer), size of the 
cabinet (standard or compact), type of defrost system (manual, partial, or automatic), presence or 
absence of through­the­door (TTD) ice service, and placement of the fresh food and freezer 
compartments for refrigerator­freezers. 
DOE established separate product classes for compact products (<220 L or <7.75 ft3) 
because fewer opportunities are available for reducing energy consumption in these products. 
Space is limited in compact units, so increasing the wall thickness is undesirable. Limited high­
efficiency compressor options are available in the capacity ranges appropriate for compact 
refrigerators. These units typically use natural convection evaporators and condensers and, 
therefore, cannot employ better fan motors as an energy­saving option.  
3.2.1.2  Product Classes Modifications 
Table 3.2.1 below shows six proposed new product classes. Two of these new product 
classes, currently called product class 5A, automatic defrost refrigerator­freezers with bottom­
mounted freezer with TTD ice service, and product class 10A, chest freezers with automatic 
defrost, were identified in the framework document as product classes 19 and 20. DOE proposes 
to establish these two new product classes pursuant to its decision order to grant exemptions to 
standards for these specific product categories. DOE will adopt the product class designations for 
these products which have been adopted by Canada in order to maintain international 
consistency. The additional new product classes are all­refrigerator products which are proposed 
to be separated from their current product classes which currently include refrigerators with 
freezer compartments, refrigerator­freezers, and/or all­refrigerators. The proposed test procedure 
changes described in section  3.2.2.7 will result in significantly higher energy use for refrigerators 
with freezer compartments and refrigerator­freezers and somewhat less energy use for all­
3­2

refrigerators. Hence, maintaining meaningful but fair energy standards requires the separation of 
all­refrigerators from the other product types. 
DOE’s Office of Hearings and Appeals granted four exceptions for refrigerator­freezer
products with bottom­mounted freezer and TTD ice service, to Maytag Corporation (Maytag), 
LG Electronics, Inc. (LG), Samsung Electronics, and Electrolux Home Products. DOE granted 
Maytag its exception on August 11, 2005 (case number TEE­0022), LG’s exception on 
November 9, 2005 (case number TEE­0025), Samsung’s exception on July 26, 2007 (case 
number TEE­0047) and Electrolux’s exception on December, 2008 (case number TEE­0056). 
Before these rulings, there was no appropriately­defined category for this type of product, since 
the minimum standard for product class 5 (refrigerator­freezers with automatic defrost with 
bottom­mounted freezer without TTD ice service) was established to cover only products 
without TTD ice­service at the time of its development. The actual energy consumption of this 
new product (i.e., with TTD ice­service) is higher than that of product class 5 due to the added 
heat loss through the door to the fresh­food space, the reduced temperatures of the space reserved 
in the fresh food compartment for ice storage, which is maintained at lower temperatures than the 
rest of the fresh food compartment, and the energy consumed by the fan used to cool the space 
used for ice production and storage. 
DOE’s Office of Hearings and Appeals granted an exception to Electrolux Home
Products (Electrolux) for a specific brand of chest freezer with automatic defrost (case number 
TEE­0012). The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) filed a letter 
supporting this exemption and recommended that DOE use the direct final rule process to 
establish a new class of chest freezers that would correspond to the minimum efficiency standard 
for automatic defrost chest freezers. The minimum standard for product class 10 (chest freezers 
and all other freezers) was established to cover products without automatic defrost at the time of 
its development. The actual energy consumption of the new product (i.e., with automatic defrost) 
is higher than that of product class 10 due to the added energy consumption associated with the 
automatic defrost system. 
DOE is considering combining product classes 1 and 2 and also combining product 
classes 11 and 12. The shipment levels for product classes 1 and 2 are low and the energy 
conservation standards for these products are currently identical. The shipments for product class 
12 are also very low. Although the standard for product classes 12 is currently at a higher energy 
level than for product class 12, there is no obvious technical basis for this distinction. The key 
difference between these classes is that product class 12 includes only refrigerator­freezers with 
partial automatic defrost. These systems have a manual defrost evaporator for the freezer 
compartment (as do refrigerator­freezers of product class 11), and they also include a second 
evaporator in the fresh food compartment which undergoes off­cycle defrost, a process which 
involves no addition of energy to achieve defrost.

section.4 This Haier product became active on the ENERGY STAR database in 2007 but is no 
longer for sale. It was classified as a side­mount refrigerator­freezer with TTD features (product

freezers. (10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendices A1 and B1) DOE recently addressed issues 
pertaining to defrost systems, wine cooling refrigeration products, anti­sweat heaters, chest 
freezers with automatic defrost, and refrigerator­freezers with bottom­mounted freezers 
incorporating through­the­door (TTD) features. Additional issues relevant to the test procedures 
include test result repeatability, references to an older version of the ANSI­AHAM HRF­1 test 
standard, circumvention, convertible bottom­drawer refrigerator­freezers and other 
configurations with more than two compartments, standby and off mode energy use, and 
international test procedure harmonization. The ongoing rulemaking to modify the test procedure 
addresses many of these issues. 
3.2.2.1  New Defrost Systems 
DOE published a direct final rule on March 7, 2003 which amended the test procedure for 
refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers to modify the test period for “long­time” and adaptive 
automatic defrost refrigerator­freezers. 68 FR 10957. This revision became effective in May 
2003. The energy test for such refrigerators consists of two or three parts; the third part applies 
only to adaptive defrost refrigerators and is optional. The first part measures energy use not 
including defrost events, and the second measures the energy contribution associated with 
defrost. The measurement for this second part of the test originally was specified to start as the 
refrigerator­freezer initiates defrost during a compressor on cycle. The new test procedure allows 
for a delay between compressor shutdown and defrost initiation, allowing the evaporator to warm
up somewhat before initiation of defrost, thus saving a portion of the defrost energy 
consumption.  
3.2.2.2  Control of Anti­Sweat Heaters 
DOE granted a test procedure waiver to General Electric Company (GE) for anti­sweat 
heaters with automatic controls. GE developed a new product line of refrigerator­freezers that 
have sensors to detect ambient temperature and humidity, allowing the control system to adjust 
the wattage of anti­sweat heaters to provide only enough heat to evaporate excess moisture. DOE 
awarded this waiver on February 27, 2008.6 The waiver provides a method for determining the 
energy use of an adaptive anti­sweat heater. A similar waiver was granted to Whirlpool 
Corporation on May 5, 2009.7 The ongoing test procedure rulemaking proposes a variable anti­
sweat heater test procedure to address the GE waiver and the Whirlpool petition for waiver. 
3.2.2.3  Testing of Combination Wine Storage­­Freezer Products 
As discussed in Section 3.1.1.2, DOE has modified the definition of refrigerators to 
exclude wine storage products. However, DOE has not modified the definition of refrigerator­
freezers in a similar fashion to exclude products which combine a freezer compartment with a 
wine storage compartment. DOE granted a waiver to Liebherr Hausgeräte from the existing DOE 
test procedure for residential electric refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers, for Liebherr’s 
combination wine storage­freezer line of appliances. According to the current definitions, these 
products are refrigerator­freezers. In granting the waiver, DOE requires that Liebherr test or rate 
its combination wine storage­freezer products using a modified procedure proposed by Liebherr 
3­5  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
in which the wine storage compartment temperature standardized temperature is 55 °F, and the 
freezer compartment standardized temperature is 5 °F. The wine storage compartment of units 
tested by this method must not be convertible to any other type of compartment, and must 
account for 50 percent or more of the total volume.8 DOE expects to propose revision of the 
definition of refrigerator­freezer to exclude these products in the ongoing refrigeration product 
test procedure rulemaking. The establishment of Wine Storage product categories and classes 
thereof is discussed in Chapter 2. 
3.2.2.4  Repeatability Issues for Testing Compact Refrigerators  
Because of inconsistencies in test results for compact refrigerators, the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigated repeatability issues and published a report 
entitled “Repeatability of Energy Consumption Test Results for Compact Refrigerators.”9 In 
addition, NIST participated in a task force formed by AHAM to revise their AHAM HRF­1, 
Energy, Performance and Capacity of Household Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezers and 
Freezers test procedure, which is referenced by the DOE test procedure. The latest version of 
AHAM’s test procedure is now AHAM HRF­1­2008.10 The existing DOE test procedure still 
references an older version of the AHAM test procedure, AHAM HRF­1­1979. DOE plans to 
amend the test procedure to reference the most recent version of AHAM HRF­1. 
Recent versions of AHAM HRF­1 clarified that the distance between the rear wall of the 
test sample and the test room wall or simulated wall should be at the minimum distance 
recommended by the manufacturer’s installation instructions. This is one of the issues mentioned 
in the NIST report. In contrast, the 1979 version of HRF­1 specified that this distance be “in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.” The AHAM HRF­1­2008 addresses, among 
other issues, simplification of determining cabinet compartment internal volume, another of the 
issues discussed in the NIST report. 
3.2.2.5  Circumvention 
Another issue that has been addressed by recent versions of AHAM HRF­1 is the use of 
controls or features in products that have the effect of circumventing or frustrating the objective 
of the test procedure. Some refrigerator­freezer models, for example, deactivate certain energy­
using components during testing, resulting in a rated performance that is significantly different 
than actual field performance. EPCA requires that test procedures must be “reasonably designed 
to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, water use . . ., or estimated 
annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of 
use, as determined by the Secretary . . . .” 42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(3). This statutory requirement may 
be undermined if products are purposefully designed to use controls or features that produce test 
results that are so unrepresentative of a product’s actual energy or water consumption as to 
provide materially inaccurate comparative data. AHAM incorporated provisions that address 
circumvention in its 2007 and 2008 test procedure revisions. The ongoing DOE test procedure 
rulemaking proposes updating DOE’s test procedures for refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and 
freezers to reference the latest version of AHAM HRF­1 in order to include by reference 
language which will more strongly bans circumvention and to provide clarification regarding test

sample set­up to help prevent inconsistencies in test results. DOE notes that in its updated 
ENERGY STAR requirements for refrigerator­freezers in 2008, the ENERGY STAR program
has included a provision to prohibit models from meeting the ENERGY STAR criteria through 
this type of circumvention scheme.11 
3.2.2.6  Bottom­Drawer Refrigerator­Freezer Models
As discussed above in section 3.3, convertible bottom­drawer refrigerator­freezer models, 
where the bottom drawer can be used as either a freezer or a fresh food section, have been 
produced, although it is unclear whether any such products are currently on the market. It 
appears that the bottom drawer of these product types were tested as a fresh food compartment 
rather than a freezer. This is inconsistent with the provisions of AHAM HRF­1­1979 as well as 
AHAM HRF­1­2008, which require control of compartments that are convertible between 
freezer and fresh food temperature to be tested in the highest energy use position. The ongoing 
DOE test procedure rulemaking addresses this issue and solicits feedback regarding whether this 
requirement needs to be reinforced in the DOE test procedure.
3.2.2.7  Harmonizing with International Test Procedures 
Working Group 12 of Technical Committee 59 of the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) is developing IEC 62552, an international test procedure for refrigerators, 
refrigerator­freezers, and freezers. One of the goals of this effort is to maximize harmonization 
among energy test procedures for countries representing key markets for these products. As a 
result, AHAM has incorporated compartment temperature changes into AHAM HRF­1­2008 
which are consistent with the IEC standard. These changes include (1) standard test temperatures 
of 0 °F rather than 5 °F for the freezer compartment of a refrigerator­freezer and 39 °F rather 
than 45 °F for the fresh food compartment, (2) standard test temperature of 39 °F rather than 38 
°F for an all­refrigerator, and (3) standard test temperature of 39 °F rather than 45 °F for the 
fresh food compartment of a refrigerator having a freezer compartment. DOE is also revising the 
DOE energy test procedure to adopt the modified temperatures. The change in temperatures will 
clearly result in higher test energy use for refrigerator­freezers and refrigerators with freezer 
compartments and lower test energy use for all­refrigerators, thus necessitating adjustments to 
kilowatt­hour (kWh)­per­year values for all efficiency levels for these products. As mentioned in 
section 3.2.1.2, DOE proposes to separate all­refrigerators from product classes which currently 
combine all­refrigerators with other product types. It is argued that the new temperatures are 
more consistent with actual temperatures used by consumers use12,13 and that energy use 
measured using the new temperatures will also be more representative of actual field energy use. 
Chapter 5 describes DOE determination of new energy vs. adjusted volume curves for baseline­
efficiency products based on the new test procedure. 
3.2.2.8  Standby and Off Modes 
EISA requires DOE to include consideration of standby mode and off mode energy consumption 
in future amendments to both its test procedures and energy conservation standards. Specifically,

section 310 of EISA amends section 325 of EPCA (42 U.S.C. 6295) by adding the following 
definitions and other requirements pertaining to standby and off mode energy use: 
(gg) STANDBY MODE ENERGY USE. 
(1) DEFINITIONS.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Unless the Secretary determines otherwise pursuant to 
subparagraph (B), in this subsection: 
(i) ACTIVE MODE.—The term "active mode" means the condition in 
which an energy­using product:—  
(I) is connected to a main power source; 
(II) has been activated; and 
(III) provides 1 or more main functions. 
(ii) OFF MODE.—The term "off mode" means the condition in which an 
energy­using product:— 
(I) is connected to a main power source; and 
(II) is not providing any standby or active mode function. 
(iii) STANDBY MODE.—The term "standby mode" means the 
condition in which an energy­using product:— 
(I) is connected to a main power source; and  
(II) offers 1 or more of the following user­oriented or protective 
functions: 
(aa) To facilitate the activation or deactivation of other 
functions (including active mode) by remote switch 
(including remote control), internal sensor, or timer. 
(bb) Continuous functions, including information or 
status displays (including clocks) or sensor­based 
functions. 
(B) AMENDED DEFINITIONS.—The Secretary may, by rule, amend the 
definitions under subparagraph (A), taking into consideration the most current 
versions of Standards 62301 and 62087 of the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC). 
(2) TEST PROCEDURES.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Test procedures for all covered products shall be amended 
pursuant to section 323 to include standby mode and off mode energy
consumption, taking into consideration the most current versions of Standards 
62301 and 62087 of the International Electrotechnical Commission, with such 
energy consumption integrated into the overall energy efficiency, energy
consumption, or other energy descriptor for each covered product, unless the 
Secretary determines that:—
(i) the current test procedures for a covered product already fully account 
for and incorporate the standby mode and off mode energy consumption 
of the covered product,; or
(ii) such an integrated test procedure is technically infeasible for a 
particular covered product, in which case the Secretary shall prescribe a 
separate standby mode and off mode energy use test procedure for the 
covered product, if technically feasible. 
*  *  *  *  * 
(3) INCORPORATION INTO STANDARD.— 
3­8  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph (B), based on the test procedures 
required under paragraph (2), any final rule establishing or revising a standard for 
a covered product, adopted after July 1, 2010, shall incorporate standby mode 
and off mode energy use into a single amended or new standard, pursuant to 
subsection (o), if feasible. 
(B) SEPARATE STANDARDS.—If not feasible, the Secretary shall prescribe 
within the final rule a separate standard for standby mode and off mode energy
consumption, if justified under subsection (o). 
For refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers, the current test procedure captures standby 
and off mode energy use. All energy input for the test duration, including during times of 
compressor off cycle is measured, for a test time period which is at least 3 hours long. Hence, 
under provision (gg)(2)(A)(i), establishing standby and off modes and test procedures to 
incorporate them into the overall energy use is not required. Complications potentially arise for 
refrigerator features not mentioned by the test procedure that might involve some standby energy 
use during normal consumer use, but that might be disconnected or otherwise turned off during 
energy testing (e.g., a computer integrated with the refrigerator). 
3.2.3  Manufacturer Information 
This section provides information on domestic manufacturers of residential refrigerators, 
refrigerator­freezers, and freezers, including their brand names and products sold in the United 
States (section 3.2.3.1), estimated market shares (section  3.2.3.2), industry mergers and 
acquisitions (section  3.2.3.3), and product distribution channels (section  3.2.3.4). The section 
also discusses manufacturer trade groups (section  3.2.3.5) and manufacturers of compressors 
(section 3.2.3.6), as this is one of the most important components of residential refrigeration 
products. 
3.2.3.1  Refrigerator, Refrigerator­Freezer, and Freezer Manufacturers 
Table 3.2.2 lists refrigerator, refrigerator­freezer, and freezer manufacturers selling 
products in the United States. The second column indicates whether the manufacturer is a 
member of AHAM, and the third column indicates whether the manufacturer produces products 
that are ENERGY STAR compliant. Manufacturers that are a member of AHAM are listed first 
in the table and generally have the largest U.S. market shares. There are also several smaller 
manufacturers supplying products to the U.S. Those smaller manufacturers that produce 
ENERGY STAR­compliant products are listed directly after AHAM member manufacturers. 
Table 3.2.2 also indicates the types of products that each manufacturer produces. Product 
types include: standard­size refrigerator­freezers, freezers, compact units, built­in units, custom
units, undercounter units, luxury units, and other types. Other types include: units with more than 
three doors, units for ‘compact kitchens’ other than compact refrigerators, refrigerated drawers, 
and commercial­size units.

3.2.3.2  Refrigerator, Refrigerator­Freezer, and Freezer Manufacturer Market 
Shares 
Appliance magazine provides market share data for the most significant manufacturers 
(i.e., manufacturers with the greatest sales) for the following four product types: (1) standard­size 
refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers, (2) compact refrigerators, (3) built­in/undercounter 
refrigerators, and (4) freezers.14 Table 3.2.3 through Table 3.2.6 show how market shares have 
changed over at least a ten­year period. Market shares among the largest manufacturers of 
standard­size refrigerator­freezers have remained relatively stable. Whirlpool Corporation 
(Whirlpool)’s 2006 acquisition of Maytag Corporation (Maytag) (discussed below) now gives 
Whirlpool the largest U.S. market share. Also, Haier America Trading, LLC (Haier), a relatively 
recent entrant to the market, captured three percent of the market in 2006.

The market for compact refrigerators has seen a dramatic shift since 1993 (Table  3.2.4). 
SANYO North America Corporation (Sanyo) had the largest market share by far in 1993, but 
now accounts for only seven percent of the market. Haier now has the largest compact 
refrigerator market share, followed by the joint venture between GE and Mexican appliance 
company Grupo P.I. Mabe S.A. (Mabe).

Market share data for full­size built­in refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers is not 
publicly available. Key manufacturers in this product category include Sub­Zero, General 
Electric’s Monagram line, Whirlpool’s Kitchenaid line, Viking, and Northland. Manufacturers 
providing imported products for this market include Liebherr, Bosch, and Miele. AHAM has 
recently begun collecting shipment data on built­in products. The percentage of overall 
shipments represented by built­in products has fluctuated between 2005 and 2007 between 1.6% 
and 2.2%. This includes both full­size and compact (undercounter) built­in products. This data 
was provided by AHAM as part of the pre­NOPR phase of this rulemaking. 
For chest and upright freezers, Electrolux has retained the largest market share for ten 
years (Table  3.2.6). Haier, which was not in the market in 1995, now captures 13 percent of the 
market.

Maytag acquired Jenn­Air Corporation (Jenn­Air) in 1982, Magic Chef, Inc. (Magic Chef) in 
1986, and Amana Appliances (Amana) in 2001. Whirlpool acquired the KitchenAid division of 
Hobart Corporation (KitchenAid) in 1986. White Consolidated Industries (WCI) acquired 
Frigidaire in 1979, and AB Electrolux acquired WCI (including Frigidaire) in 1986. 
Mergers and acquisitions have two purposes. First, they produce large corporations with 
the financial resources and stability to be successful in a competitive market. Second, mergers 
and acquisitions mean manufacturers can have a complete line of home appliances. This product 
diversification allows firms to offer a complete set of appliances to consumers, an important 
feature in the builder market. There is also increasing worldwide competition in the major 
appliance market, so mergers and acquisitions are likely to continue.  
On August 22, 2005, Whirlpool and Maytag announced plans to merge in a deal worth 
$2.7 billion.15 Maytag shareholders approved the merger on December 22, 2005. The U.S. 
Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division initiated an investigation into the effects of the 
merger, including potential lessening of competition or the creation of a monopoly. Opponents of 
the merger asserted that the combined companies would control as much as 70 percent of the 
residential laundry market and as much as 50 percent of the residential dishwasher market.16 
Whirlpool claimed that its large potential residential laundry market share was skewed because 
the company produces washing machines for Sears, which sells them under its Kenmore in­
house brand. Whirlpool further stated that it must periodically bid with other manufacturers to 
keep the Kenmore contract and that Sears controls the pricing of the Kenmore units.17 
In early January 2006, U.S. Senator Tom Harkin and U.S. Representative Leonard 
Boswell called on the DOJ to block the merger, claiming it would give Whirlpool an unfair 
advantage in the home appliance industry. On March 29, 2006, DOJ closed its investigation and 
approved the merger. DOJ stated that “the proposed transaction is not likely to reduce 
competition substantially. The combination of strong rival suppliers with the ability to expand 
sales significantly and large cost savings and other efficiencies that Whirlpool appears likely to 
achieve indicates that this transaction is not likely to harm consumer welfare.”18

The DOJ Antitrust Division focused its investigation on residential laundry, although it 
considered impacts across all products offered by the two companies. DOJ determined that the 
merger would not give Whirlpool market power in the sale of its products and that any attempt to 
raise prices would likely be unsuccessful. To support this claim, DOJ provided reasons 
including: (1) other U.S. brands, including Kenmore, GE, and Frigidaire, are well established; 
(2) foreign manufacturers, including LG and Samsung, are gaining market share; (3) existing 
U.S. manufacturers are below production capacity; (4) the large home appliance retailers have 
alternatives available to resist price increase attempts; and (5) Whirlpool and Maytag 
substantiated large cost savings and other efficiencies to benefit consumers.18 
Whirlpool and Maytag completed the merger on March 31, 2006.  
3.2.3.4  Distribution Channels 
Most residential refrigerators and freezers move directly from manufacturers to retail 
outlets. Table 3.2.7 identifies the types of retail stores through which major appliances, including 
refrigerators and freezers, are sold based on data from AHAM 2005 Fact Book.19 
Table 3.2.7 Major Appliance Sales by Channel
Type of Store  Percentage of Appliance Purchases 
Department Store (such as Sears or Kohls)  34.7%
Appliance Store or Consumer Electronics Store  30.9%
Home Improvement Store (such as Lowe’s or Home Depot)  23.8%
Discount Store (such as Wal­Mart or K­Mart)  2.0%
Membership Warehouse Club/Store (such as Sam’s or Costco)  1.8% 
Another type of store  6.8%
Source: AHAM Fact Book 
A certain share of shipments is purchased through channels other than retail outlets, e.g., 
by multi­family home builders for installation in new homes. The Consortium for Energy 
Efficiency (CEE) estimates that 20 to 30 percent of home appliance sales are commercial sales, 
i.e., sales to single/multi­family builders, contractors, government, public housing, and multi­
family property managers.20 Because single­family builders typically do not include refrigerator­
freezers as part of a home sale, the 20 to 30 percent estimate by CEE is probably too high for the 
refrigerator market. 
3.2.3.5  Manufacturer Trade Groups 
AHAM is the primary manufacturer trade group representing most manufactures of 
refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers. AHAM provides services to its members 
including government relations; certification programs for room air conditioners, dehumidifiers, 
and room air cleaners; an active communications program; and technical services and research. 
In addition, AHAM conducts other market and consumer research studies and publishes a 
biennial Major Appliance Fact Book. AHAM also develops and maintains technical test 
procedures for various appliances to provide uniform, repeatable procedures for measuring 
specific product characteristics and performance features.

3.2.3.6  Compressor Manufacturers and Market Shares 
Because the compressor is a key energy­using component of refrigerators, it is important 
to determine which compressor manufacturers are supplying the U.S. refrigerator market. 
According to three sources, Embraco is the compressor manufacturer with the largest global 
market share, although several other manufacturers have significant global market share as 
well.21, 22 For the U.S. refrigerator market, based on data from Embraco, it has by far the largest 
market share.23 Besides Embraco, there are five other major compressor manufacturers supplying 
the world refrigerator and freezer market: Appliances Components Companies (ACC), 
Tecumseh Compressor Company (Tecumseh), Danfoss Compressors GmbH, Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co., Ltd. (Matsushita), and LG Electronics, Inc. (LG). Table  3.2.8 lists the compressor 
manufacturers and their estimated global and U.S. market shares.

3.2.4  Regulatory Programs 
The following section details current regulatory programs mandating energy conservation 
standards for refrigerator/freezers. It covers U.S. Federal energy conservation standards, State 
standards, standards in Canada and Mexico (which may impact the companies servicing the 
North American market), and international standards. 
3.2.4.1  Federal Energy Conservation Standards 
The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA) (42 U.S.C. 6291– 
6309) established efficiency standards for refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers with a total 
refrigerated volume of less than 1104 L (39 ft3) and for freezers with a total refrigerated volume 
of less than 850 L (30 ft3). Compact refrigerators and freezers represent separate product classes 
and have a volume less than 220 L (7.75 ft3) and a height of 0.91 meters (36 inches) or less. The 
minimum efficiency levels depend on product class and adjusted volume. The adjusted volume is 
equal to the fresh food internal volume plus an adjustment factor which depends on the product 
type times the freezer internal volume. The adjustment factor is 1.63 for refrigerator­freezers, 
1.44 for refrigerators with freezer compartments, 1.00 for all­refrigerators (which may have a 
freezer compartment with less than 0.5 ft3 volume), and 1.73 for freezers. Maximum annual 
energy use is expressed as kilowatt­hours (kWh) per year (yr) 
3­16  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
NAECA initially established energy conservation standards for refrigerator­freezers that 
became effective in 1990. DOE amended NAECA with new standards that went into effect in 
1993, followed by the current amended standards that became effective in July 2001. 
Refrigerator­freezers manufactured to meet the 2001 standard typically consume about 30 
percent less energy than required under the 1993 efficiency regulations. The 1993 and 2001 
standards are summarized in Table  3.2.9 below. 
As discussed in section 3.2.1, there are two additional product classes that DOE proposes 
to establish due to exemptions it granted in recent years for products not adhering to existing 
product class definitions: (1) automatic defrost refrigerator­freezers with bottom­mounted freezer 
and TTD ice service, and (2) automatic defrost chest freezers. These proposed product classes 
are listed as 5A and 10A in Table 3.2.9.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) (P.L. 110­140), requires that 
DOE publish a final rule no later than December 31, 2010 to determine whether to amend the 
standards in effect for refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers manufactured on or after 
January 1, 2014. 
3.2.4.2  State Energy Conservation Standards 
As part of its Title 20 Appliance Efficiency Regulations, the California Energy 
Commission (CEC) has established standards for consumer refrigeration products that are not 
covered by Federal standards. CEC set standards for wine chillers (Table  3.2.10) and freezers 
that have a total refrigerated volume greater than 850 L (30 ft3) (Table 3.2.11).24 The standards 
for freezers with volume greater than 30 ft3 are numerically identical to the federal standards for 
smaller freezers—the California standards simply extend the federal standards beyond the 
federal size limitation.

3.2.4.3  Canadian Energy Conservation Standards 
Refrigerators and freezers are regulated products in Canada under the Canadian Energy
Efficiency Regulations. The regulations reference Canadian Standards Association (CSA) 
CAN/CSA­C300­00, Energy Performance and Capacity of Household Refrigerators, 
Refrigerator-Freezers, and Freezers, for the testing procedure and for maximum annual energy 
consumption (MAEC) limits for residential refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers. The 
product classes and MAEC limits in the Canadian regulations are the same as in the U.S. Federal 
standards. 
In November 2006, Canada added two new product types to its Regulations (Amendment

In 2005, the European Parliament adopted a Commission proposal for a directive on 
establishing a framework for setting eco­design requirements (such as energy efficiency 
requirements) for all energy­using products in the residential, tertiary (services), and industrial 
sectors.29 EU­wide rules for eco­design are intended to ensure that disparities among national 
regulations do not become obstacles to intra­EU trade. The directive does not directly introduce 
binding requirements for specific products, but does define conditions and criteria for setting 
requirements regarding environmentally relevant product characteristics (such as energy 
consumption), and allows these requirements to be improved quickly and efficiently. The 
directive will be followed by implementing measures that will establish the eco­design
requirements. 
It is difficult to compare the standards in other countries with those in the U.S. due to 
differences in test procedures. The development of an international test procedure under the 
auspices of the International Electrotechnical Commission has international test procedure 
harmonization as a key objective. Establishment of Standard IEC 62552, which is currently 
under development, should make it easier in future to compare international refrigeration product 
energy standard levels. 
3.2.5  Voluntary and other Federal and State Programs 
In addition to mandatory standards, there are voluntary programs—e.g., the Federal 
Energy Management Program (FEMP) and CEE—as well as other Federal and State policies that 
affect the efficiency of new refrigerators and freezers. 
3.2.5.1  ENERGY STAR 
Historical ENERGY STAR Requirements  
 ENERGY STAR is a voluntary program administered by the U.S. government to 
promote energy efficient consumer products.  Table 3.2.14 below shows the history of ENERGY 
STAR energy use criteria for each of the three covered product categories.

As of 2006, the market share of ENERGY STAR­compliant full­size refrigerators and 
refrigerator­freezers was just under 30%.30 Within this category, approximately 20 percent of 
top­ and bottom­mount and 50 percent of side­mount refrigerator­freezer units sold in the U.S. 
were ENERGY STAR compliant. Some States (i.e., Massachusetts, Michigan) have waived state
sales tax for purchase of appliances that meet ENERGY STAR levels. 
New ENERGY STAR requirements effective in 2008 
The current ENERGY STAR criteria, drafted with input from stakeholders and two 
rounds of public comments, went into effect on April 28, 2008. To support the change, 
ENERGY STAR released a market analysis30 and a final report on proposed program
requirements.31 Table 3.2.15 shows the number of models that met the current Federal standard 
for refrigerators and available models with efficiencies 15 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent 
higher than the Federal standard, as of April 2007 (prior to the 2008 revision). ENERGY STAR 
program staff deemed the number of models offered to consumers at the higher efficiencies to be 
sufficient to warrant changing the labeling criteria.

Electric utilities and other organizations promote the purchase of highly energy­efficient 
refrigerators through consumer rebates. Typically, these programs offer rebates for products 
meeting existing ENERGY STAR efficiency levels. Table  3.2.20 below lists some rebates that 
were offered in 2006. Some utilities also offer incentives to retire old and inefficient appliances.  
Many utilities also offer rebates and disposal services for recycling old units in order to 
encourage consumers to purchase new, more efficient units and to ensure the safe disposal of 
hazardous waste.

three groups: (1) standard­size units, (2) built­in units, and (3) compact units. Both sources break 
down freezer shipments into chest and upright units. Unfortunately, neither source provides any 
further level of disaggregation. As discussed below, standard­size shipments can be broken down 
into two broad groups: (1) top­ and bottom­mount refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers, and (2) 
side­mount units. 
Figure 3.2.1 shows historical shipments of refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers. Figure 
3.2.2 shows historical shipments of freezers. In the past decade, annual shipments of standard 
refrigerator­freezers have grown from 8 million to 11 million, although shipments have dropped
off significantly in 2007 and 2008 in response to poor economic conditions. Annual shipments of 
compact refrigerators grew from one million to roughly 3 million, but shipments dropped starting 
in 2006. Note that the data for refrigerators include products used in non­residential settings 
(e.g., hotels and offices), but the size of this market segment is unknown. 
Shipments of chest and upright freezers have grown less rapidly than those of standard 
refrigerator­freezers. These shipments rose from 1.5 million in 1997 to 2.5 million in 2002, but 
shipments dropped starting in 2005 and are now at 2 million annually. Shipments of compact 
freezers are roughly 0.5 million.

Figure 3.2.2 Annual Shipments of Freezers 
For DOE’s 2005 technical analysis of amended energy conservation standards for 
residential refrigerator­freezers, AHAM provided historical shipments data for the time period 
1998–2004, broken down into three broad groups: (1) top­ and bottom­mount refrigerator­
freezers, (2) side­mount units, and (3) single­door units.38 Table 3.2.21 below shows market 
share data for only two of the above three groups—top­ or bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers 
and side­mount refrigerator­freezers. According to DOE’s 2005 technical analysis, these two 
product groupings account for over 99 percent of standard­size refrigerator­freezer shipments. 
Data provided by AHAM as part of the pre­NOPR phase shows that in recent years single­door 
units accounted for 0.2% or less of shipments of standard­size refrigerators and refrigerator­
freezers. This data also shows a strong shift towards bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers in the 
last few years, coinciding with reduction in market share of both side­mount and top­mount 
refrigerator­freezers.

refrigerator­freezers without TTD ice service in the size category range of 14 to 21 ft3 b comprise 
81 percent of total top­ and bottom­mount refrigerators, and (2) side­mount refrigerator­freezers 
with TTD ice service in the size category range of 21 to 30 ft3 comprise 98 percent of total side­

3.2.6.2  Historical Efficiencies
The average efficiency of new refrigerators and freezers has increased greatly since the 
1980s. Figure 3.2.3 below (which shows annual electricity consumption) indicates the changes in 
efficiency resulting from the Federal standards that took effect in 1990, 1993, and 2001. Note 
that the average efficiency trends shown in the chart reflect changes in product size and features 
as well as changes in the efficiency within specific types of products. In particular, the growing 
market share of side­mount refrigerator­freezers placed upward pressure on the average annual 
electricity use of new refrigerator­freezers.  
b Size category is based on ft3 of total refrigerated volume (fresh food volume plus freezer volume).

3.2.6.3  Imports and Exports 
The share of domestic shipments of refrigerators and freezers accounted for by imports 
grew significantly in the 1994­2004 period. Refrigerator imports totaled nearly six million units 
in 2004. Over one­third of the imports came from Mexico. Freezer imports totaled around one 
million units in 2004.19 
Annual refrigerator exports—mostly to Canada—were in the 1.0 to 1.1 million units 
range in the 1994­2004 period, while annual freezer exports ranged between 200,000 and 
250,000 units. 19 
3.2.7  Saturation in U.S. Homes 
Saturation refers to the percentage of homes with a given product. DOE used four 
primary sources of information on the saturation and ownership of refrigerators, refrigerator­
freezers, and freezers in U.S. homes: (1) a 2001 report prepared for AHAM by NFO Research, 
Inc.,41 (2) Appliance magazine, (3) the Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s Residential 
Energy Consumption Survey (RECS),42,43,44 and (4) a 2005 AHAM report entitled Major 
Appliance Saturation & Marketing Factors Study.45 Only RECS provides market saturations for 
recently­built housing; this information is useful for forecasting future shipments to new 
housing. 
The saturation of standard refrigerators has been close to 100 percent for two decades
(Table 3.2.23). The RECS data show that the share of households with two or more refrigerators 
grew from 13 percent in 1993 to 15 percent in 2001 and to 19 percent in 2005 (the current 
percentage with two or more is likely even higher).

magazine reports that freezer saturation has risen from 40 percent in 1993 to 45 percent in 2005, 
but the NFO study reports that the 2001 level (41 percent) was lower than in 1990 (45 percent).

in past Fact Books. Table 3.2.27 lists the prices for eight years spanning 1980–2002. The real 
price of refrigerator­freezers and freezers (expressed in 2008 $) declined during the 1980s and 
1990s. However, in 2002, the prices of both types of products increased relative to the year 1998.

DOE’s most recent technical analysis of amended energy conservation standards for 
residential refrigerator­freezers published in October 2005 provided the retail price of the two 
largest product classes of refrigerator­freezers: top­mount refrigerator­freezers without TTD 
features and side­mount refrigerator­freezers with TTD features.38 The analysis also established 
the retail price of products meeting existing ENERGY STAR levels.

Baseline Retail Prices 
DOE determined the retail price of baseline­efficiency top­mount refrigerator­freezers 
without TTD features and side­mount refrigerator­freezers with TTD features from data 
purchased from NPD Group. The NPD Group dataset included information about the average 
price of more than 2000 refrigerator models sold in 2004 in the United States.c Table 3.2.28 
below summarizes the retail price data for three capacity sizes for each of the product types. The 
retail prices correspond to baseline­efficiency products, i.e., products that just meet the existing 
energy conservation standards.

Price of ENERGY STAR 
DOE’s October 2005 report also provided incremental retail price estimates of ENERGY 
STAR products relative to baseline products. At the time, ENERGY STAR levels specified 15 
percent lower energy consumption than the federal energy standard level. DOE used two 
approaches to estimate the retail prices: (1) the application of manufacturer and retailer markups 
to manufacturer costs, and (2) a retail price analysis of ENERGY STAR compliant products 
based on data from the NPD Group. Table  3.2.29 below summarizes the retail price increments 
associated with meeting ENERGY STAR relative to baseline models of several different 
capacity sizes. Note that the two approaches yield roughly the same average retail price 
increment of meeting ENERGY STAR with the exception of the 27–30 ft3 side­mount 
refrigerator.

3.2.8.3  2007 Manufacturer­Suggested Retail Prices 
DOE collected retail price data for several refrigerator­freezer and freezer models from 
five manufacturers’ Internet web sites: General Electric, Whirlpool, Frigidaire, Maytag, and LG 
Electronics. The price data reflect manufacturer­suggested retail prices and, therefore, may not 
reflect actual sales prices. Even so, DOE conducted a statistical analysis of the data to determine 
the effect of certain attributes, including the impact of meeting existing ENERGY STAR levels. 
DOE collected data on 1,268 refrigerator­freezer and freezer models. The collected data 
set included information about the retail price and model number of refrigerator­freezers and 
freezers sold in 2007 in the U.S., coupled with information about the brand, attributes (i.e., color, 
stainless steel, built­in, French doors), and whether the product met existing ENERGY STAR 
levels. DOE sorted the data into the following product types: (1) side­mount refrigerator­freezers 
consisting of 523 models, (2) top­mount refrigerator­freezers consisting of 340 models, (3) 
bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers consisting of 281 models, (4) chest freezers consisting of 46 
models, and (5) upright freezers consisting of 54 models. 
Figure 3.2.4 through Figure  3.2.8 present price distributions for each product type, 
showing variation in price of products which do not meet ENERGY STAR criteria as well as 
variation in price for products with comply with ENERGY STAR. The price distributions of 
side­mount and top­mount refrigerator­freezers in Figure  3.2.4 and Figure  3.2.5 indicate that 
ENERGY STAR generally increases the price and that there is a wider price variation for 
ENERGY STAR products. Also, both refrigerator­freezer types exhibit skewed price 
distributions, i.e., more models are low­priced with relatively few high­priced models (as an 
example, fewer than 10 models were priced above $1,300 for top­mounts). The price 
distributions for bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers, Figure  3.2.6 below, show that French­door 
configurations are more of a factor in contributing to high price than ENERGY STAR efficiency 
levels. Most bottom­mount models already meet ENERGY STAR, and those models configured 
with French doors are distinctly more expensive. The price distributions for upright freezers 
show that ENERGY STAR models are generally more expensive (Figure  3.2.7). For chest 
freezers, there are several models with and without ENERGY STAR that are priced similarly, 
but there are no low­priced models that qualify for ENERGY STAR (Figure  3.2.8).

refrigerator­freezer sample was reduced from 523 to 502, the top­mount refrigerator­freezer 
sample was reduced from 340 to 321, the bottom­mount refrigerator­freezer sample was reduced
from 281 to 272, the upright freezer sample was reduced from 54 to 53, and the chest freezer 
sample was reduced from 46 to 43. DOE performed the regression analysis with two types of 
regression equations that it formulated to determine the price increment due to each attribute: (1) 
a ‘basic’ equation where price is a function of only ENERGY STAR qualifying levels (the focus 
variable); and (2) a ‘complete variable’ equation where price is a function of ENERGY STAR 
(the focus variable), product attributes (stainless steel, built­in, French doors), and the brand.  
Table 3.2.30 presents the summary results of the regression analysis. The first column in 
the table indicates the product type and the second column presents the ‘constant’ price (i.e., the 
price without any of the attributes under consideration, also referred to as a baseline model) for 
each product type. The ‘coefficients’ represent the price adder for a product with a specific 
attribute (i.e., ENERGY STAR, French doors for bottom­mount products, stainless steel cabinet, 
and brand). If the value is positive, than the ‘coefficient’ for the attribute is added to the 
‘constant’ price. If the value is negative, than the ‘coefficient’ for the attribute is subtracted from
the ‘constant’ price. For example, for side­mount refrigerator­freezers, the ‘coefficient’ for 
ENERGY STAR is $208. Therefore, the added retail price of an ENERGY STAR side­mount 
refrigerator­freezer is $208, raising the baseline price from $1128 to $1336. Also presented in 
Table 3.2.30 are the adjusted R­squared value and the number in the sample. In a multiple linear 
regression model, adjusted R square measures the proportion of the variation in the dependent 
variable (retail price) accounted for by the explanatory variables.d 
DOE found that the incremental price effect of meeting ENERGY STAR levels is 
significant at a 95 percent confidence level for all product types with the exception of bottom­
mount refrigerator­freezers. In the case of side­mount refrigerator­freezers, qualifying for 
ENERGY STAR adds $208 to the price of the baseline model, while for top­mount refrigerator­
freezers it adds $63. These price increments are significantly higher than those from DOE’s 
October 2005 technical report (see Table  3.2.29 above). Because the analysis conducted for the 
2005 technical report was more rigorous (for example, DOE conducted the 2005 retail price 
analysis using sales­weighted point­of­sale data), the price increments for meeting ENERGY 
STAR based on the 2007 manufacturer suggested retail price data are likely not as accurate a 
price indication of meeting ENERGY STAR. Rather, the analysis based on the 2007 prices 
simply confirms that ENERGY STAR products are more expensive than baseline products. In 
the case of upright and chest freezers, the analysis shows that the price increase associated with 
meeting ENERGY STAR is $107 and $121, respectively. 
For bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers, meeting ENERGY STAR levels is not a 
significant factor at a 95 percent confidence level. The French door attribute is significant and 
d Unlike R squared, adjusted R squared allows for the degrees of freedom associated with the sums of the squares in 
its calculation. Therefore, even though the residual sum of squares decreases or remains the same as new 
explanatory variables are added, the residual variance does not. For this reason, adjusted R square is generally 
considered to be a more accurate goodness­of­fit measure than R square.

adds over $330 to the price of a baseline unit. This is consistent with the price distributions of 
bottom­mount models presented in Figure  3.2.6 above. 
The analysis suggests that stainless steel plays a significant role in the price of side­
mount, top­mount, and bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers and upright freezers. The ‘coefficient’ 
of brand suggests an effect similar to stainless steel. Brand is significant for the three 
refrigerator­freezer product types but is not significant in the case of freezers.

3.2.8.4  Refrigerator­Freezer and Freezer 2008 Retail Prices 
To determine retail prices for the year 2008, DOE drew upon proprietary retail price data 
collected by The NPD Group.46 These data reflect prices and sales at many retail outlets in the 
United States, representing more than 50 percent of retail sales nationwide. The data include 
model number, refrigerated volume, configuration of doors and ice­making, and whether the unit 
is an ENERGY STAR product. Based on these data DOE developed a sales­weighted price 
distribution for non­ENERGY STAR appliances for seven of the 20 product classes.e  Additional 
details about this price data are provided in Chapter 8 of this TSD. The average baseline retail 
prices before sales tax for each of the seven product classes are shown in Table 3.2.31.  With the 
exception of product class 3 (top­mount refrigerator­freezers), the retail prices in Table 3.2.31 
are relatively close to the manufacturer­suggested retail prices in Table 3.2.30. 
e DOE assumed that prices for non­ENERGY STAR models are a reasonable approximation of prices for the 
baseline models.

3.3  TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT 
This section provides a technology assessment for refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and 
freezers. Contained in this technology assessment are details about product operations and 
components (section  3.3.1), an examination of possible technological improvements for each 
product (section 3.3.2), and a characterization of the product efficiency levels currently 
commercially available (section 3.3.3). 
3.3.1  Product Operation and Components 
This section provides a brief description of the components and operation of refrigerators, 
refrigerator­freezers, and freezers. These descriptions provide a basis for understanding the 
technologies used to improve product efficiency. 
3.3.1.1  Product Operation 
Refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers are household appliances designed for 
the refrigerated storage of food products. Definitions for these product types and their operating 
temperature ranges are discussed in section 3.2.1.  
Figure 3.3.1 shows a schematic representation of a typical refrigeration circuit used in 
residential refrigeration products. As described by the American Society of Heating, 
Refrigerating and Air­Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Refrigeration Handbook,47 the 
refrigeration process consists of the following steps: 
1.  Electrical energy is supplied to a motor that drives a compressor, which draws cold, low­
pressure refrigerant vapor for the evaporator and compresses it. 
2.  The resulting high­pressure, high­temperature discharge gas then passes through the 
condenser, where it is cooled to saturation condition, condensed to a liquid, and possibly 
subcooled while heat is rejected to the ambient air. 
3.  Liquid refrigerant passes through a metering (pressure­reducing) capillary tube to the 
evaporator, which is at low pressure. 
3­43  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.  The low­pressure, low­temperature liquid in the evaporator absorbs heat from its 
surroundings, evaporating to a gas, which is again withdrawn by the compressor. 
Figure 3.3.1 Refrigeration Circuit 
In Figure 3.3.1 above, the metering or flow control device pictured is a non­adiabatic 
capillary tube. In this configuration, the capillary tube is soldered to the suction line to evaporate 
the residual liquid in the suction line and warm the vapor. This suction line heat exchanger (or 
the non­adiabatic capillary) increases the refrigeration capacity of the system by the amount of 
heat being transferred from the capillary to the suction side. Non­adiabatic capillary tubes are the 
most common type of metering device in refrigerator­freezers. The other type of metering 
device, an adiabatic capillary tube, is used in some refrigeration products. In this configuration, 
the capillary tube does not exchange heat with the suction line and the refrigerant expands from
the high pressure to the low pressure adiabatically. 
3.3.1.2  Primary Components 
The illustration in Figure  3.3.2 (from RemodelGuide.com48) shows the components and 
layout of a typical top­mount refrigerator­freezer. The components and layout are similar in side­
mount and bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers. Freezers also have a similar layout and 
components, but are slightly less complicated due to the fact that they have no fresh food 
compartment. The text that follows describes the following operations or components: automatic 
defrost, cooling, temperature control, lighting, ice maker, ice and water dispenser, and door seals 
and hinges.

Figure 3.3.2 Top­Mount Refrigerator­Freezer Components 
Automatic defrost 
Almost all standard­size refrigerator­freezers are self­defrosting. Manual defrost is still 
used in chest freezers, some upright freezers, and in compact refrigerators and freezers. Self­
defrosting refrigerator­freezers and freezers automatically melt frost that accumulates in the 
freezer compartment. The typical automatic defrost system has three functional components: a 
defrost timer, a defrost heater, and a defrost thermostat. 
•  Defrost timer: The timer is a clock that is energized with the compressor. The timer 
initiates defrost after a set interval of compressor operation, typically twelve hours.  
•  Defrost heater: The defrost heater is an electric resistance heating element. It is located 
just beneath or on the side of the evaporator coil, which is concealed behind a panel in the 
freezer compartment. The heater melts any ice or frost that builds up. A heater is 
typically also energized in the drip pan to prevent freeze of melted condensate and 
clogging of the drip pan drain.

•  As the frost and ice melt, the resulting water drips into a drip pan. The pan is connected 
to a tube that drains the water into a shallow pan at the bottom of the refrigerator­freezer 
or freezer. The water is then evaporated by air which is drawn by a fan through the 
condenser and over the compressor shell. In some products which do not use forced 
convection condensers, particularly freezers, a special pan is mounted on top of the 
compressor shell and the water is evaporated using heat from the compressor. 
•  Defrost thermostat: The process ends when the defrost thermostat mounted on the 
evaporator tubing senses that a sufficiently high temperature has been attained. 
Cooling 
All residential refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers work by removing heat 
from the air in the cabinet. They all have the key components shown in Figure  3.3.1: a 
compressor, a condenser, a metering or flow control device (usually a capillary tube), and an 
evaporator. 
•  Compressor: The compressor compresses refrigerant, providing the energy input 
necessary to drive the cycle. In most residential refrigeration products, the compressor is 
located at the bottom rear of the unit. In built­in refrigerator­freezers the compressor is
often located on top of the refrigerator behind a grill or grate. The compressor runs 
whenever the refrigerator thermostat calls for cooling.  
•  Condenser: The condenser is a heat exchanger located on the outside of the unit. The 
three most prevalent condenser configurations are as follows:  
–  Forced­convention condensers use fans to move air through them to provide cooling. 
These condensers are usually located under the unit near the compressor. They can be 
fabricated of steel tubes with steel wire fins or copper tubes with aluminum fins. 
–  Natural convection “static” condensers which don’t use fans are mounted to the back 
of the unit. They generally have steel tubes and steel wire fins. 
–  Hot wall condensers are integrated into the outer shell of the unit. A serpentine of
tubing is attached to the inside of the shell and provided with good thermal contact to 
the shell. This is the common configuration in freezers and it is common in compact 
refrigerators.
•  Metering or Flow Control Device (Capillary Tube): The metering device in most 
household refrigerator­freezers is a capillary tube. As discussed above in section  3.3.1.1, 
there are two common types of capillary tubes—adiabatic and non­adiabatic, although 
non­adiabatic are the most common. The capillary tube controls the pressure and flow of 
the refrigerant as it enters the evaporator.  
•  Evaporator: The evaporator is a heat exchanger located inside the unit. Similar to the 
condenser, there are three main configurations for evaporators:  
–  Forced convection evaporators use fans to move air through them to provide cooling. 
They are constructed of aluminum tubes and aluminum fins or copper tubes and 
aluminum fins. They are generally located on the rear wall of the freezer 
3­46

compartment behind a panel. They can also be located in the mullion separating the 
freezer and fresh food compartments, as shown in Figure  3.3.2. The evaporator fan 
circulates air through the evaporator and into both the freezer and fresh food 
compartments. Because the evaporator absorbs heat, it is very cold, thereby causing 
any water vapor in the air to freeze on it as frost. Most refrigerator­freezers using this 
type of evaporator employ automatic defrost. 
–  Roll bond evaporators fabricated from layers of aluminum sheet primarily use natural 
convection cooling. The refrigerant passages are formed into the evaporator walls. 
They are used in single­door refrigerators and are configured either as a flat plate at 
the rear of the cabinet or a rectangular box. In the latter configuration, the interior of 
the box is the freezer compartment. While these evaporators generally use natural 
convection and do not use an evaporator fan, some products with rear­mounted flat 
roll bond evaporators use fans for performance enhancement. Manual defrosting is 
required to defrost these evaporators. 
–  Cold wall evaporators are integrated within the walls of the freezer. This 
configuration is used in nearly all chest freezers and in many upright freezers. The 
evaporator consists of tube serpentines attached to the insulation side of the cabinet 
interior liner. These evaporators use natural convection heat transfer. 
Temperature control 
All refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers have a thermostat or electronic 
temperature control to maintain the proper temperature. Thermostats are mechanical devices 
which interrupt the electricity connection to the compressor when the temperature is sufficiently 
low. Electronic control systems generally use thermistors as temperature sensors, using relays 
mounted on the circuit boards to activate the compressor and other components such as the 
evaporator and condenser fans. 
Lighting 
Refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers with internal lighting normally have only 
one functional lighting component—the switch—which is usually a white push­button mounted 
to be depressed by operation of the door. Closing the door turns off the light. Refrigerators 
generally use standard appliance incandescent light bulbs. 
Ice maker 
Many standard­size refrigerator­freezers come equipped with an ice maker, and nearly all 
are convertible to installation of an ice maker. The ice maker is a located within the freezer 
compartment. Ice maker systems have two basic functional components: the icemaker itself, and 
the water fill valve. The most common ice makers operate as follows: 
•  The ice maker sends a signal to the water fill valve (normally located on the outside back 
of the refrigerator, near the bottom) to open and let water into the ice maker tray (or 
mold). Water fill control is usually by timed opening of the valve (usually 7­10 seconds). 
3­47  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  When the ice has frozen and reached a sufficiently low temperature (10 to 15 °F), sensed 
with a thermostat located in thermal connection with the ice tray, the ice maker begins to 
harvest (eject) the cubes.
•  To harvest the cubes, the ice maker first turns on a small heater beneath the tray. The 
heater warms the tray, to help release the ice cubes. Then a sweep fork rotates and pushes 
the cubes up and out of the tray. 
•  While the ice maker is dumping the cubes into a the ice storage bin, a metal wire similar 
to a coat hanger swings up to let the cubes drop below it. When the cubes have dropped, 
the wire rotates back down. If the holding bin is full of ice, the wire rotate far enough, 
which stops further production of ice. If the sensing wire can rotate down fully, the ice 
maker refills with water and repeats the process. 
Ice and water dispenser 
  Many standard­size refrigerator­freezers have a through­the­door (TTD) ice and/or water 
dispenser. There are several different systems for delivering ice and water through the 
refrigerator door. What follows is an explanation of the common attributes of all of the systems. 
•  Ice dispenser: For a refrigerator­freezer to provide ice through the door, the ice maker 
first dumps the ice it produces into a large bin, as discussed above. To request ice at the 
door, the user presses a lever that activates a switch. The switch turns on a motor that 
rotates an auger which pushes ice out of the bin, through a chute to the user. Some
dispensers also have blades which chop the ice to allow delivery of crushed ice. 
•  Water dispenser: The water dispenser is activated much like the ice dispenser. To request 
water at the door, the user presses a lever on the front of the refrigerator that activates a 
switch. The switch turns on an electric water valve at the back of the refrigerator­freezer. 
Water flows through the valve into a tube, then flows into a reservoir located in the fresh 
food compartment in which the water is chilled. As new water enters the reservoir, the 
water that is displaced flows through a separate tube through the dispenser. 
Door Seals 
All refrigerator, refrigerator­freezer, and freezer doors have a seal—a vinyl gasket 
attached to the door(s). The seal prevents infiltration of warm ambient air into the cabinet. The 
seal is lined with a magnet which helps to hold the door closed and create a tight seal. The 
magnetic portion of the gasket is aligned to face the steel extension of the cabinet’s external shell 
which wraps partially around the front face of the cabinet. Some gasket systems use opposing 
magnets on the cabinet side to improve door sealing force.

3.3.2.1  Insulation 
The primary thermal load on a refrigerator or freezer is the heat transfer through the walls 
and doors into the cabinet. In one study of an 18.6 ft3 top­mount refrigerator­freezer, the wall and 
door heat loads were estimated to account for almost 60 percent of the total thermal load.49 
Nearly all residential refrigeration products use polyurethane (PU) foam insulation for 
both the cabinets and the doors. Through the 1980s, CFC­11, a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), was 
used as a blowing agent in almost all PU foam insulation. However, under the Montreal Protocol, 
all CFCs were banned from use by the mid 1990s due to their high ozone depletion potential 
(ODP). In the 1990s, most manufacturers adopted use of HCFC­141b, a 
hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), which has significantly less ODP. However, because HCFC­
141b has non­zero ODP, it was banned from production in the U.S. after January 1, 2003. In 
response to the phase­out of HCFC­141b, AHAM’s Appliance Research Consortium (ARC) 
investigated several alternatives, including two hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), HFC­134a and 
HFC­245fa, and cyclopentane, a hydrocarbon (HC). HFCs and HCs both have zero ODP. HCs 
have a much lower global warming potential (GWP) than HFCs, but they are flammable. ARC, 
DOE, and EPA sponsored research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to determine the 
3­49

thermal conductivities of the three alternatives and of HCFC­141b. Based on thermal 
conductivity, ORNL identified HFC­245fa as the most attractive substance because it had the 
lowest energy penalty relative to HCFC­141b (see Table  3.3.2).50 In addition, accelerated 
lifetime performance tests conducted by ORNL indicated that the thermal conductivity of HFC­
245fa foam insulation increases by a smaller percentage than either HFC­134a or cyclopentane 
foams. Finally, despite the fact that HCs are used in Europe, flammability and volatile organic 
compound concerns led ARC to determine that HFCs were a more suitable replacement blowing 
agent.51 As a result, many manufacturers are currently using HFC­245fa blowing agent for PU 
foam insulation. However, refrigerators and freezers sold in the U.S. also are using HFC­134a, 
cyclopentane, and HCFC­141b blowing agent. The HCFC blowing agent is still allowed for 
refrigerators imported into the U.S.

Improved Resistivity of Insulation 
Past research has investigated improving the resistivity of PU foam insulation through the 
use of additives in the foam.  
Research conducted in 1996 demonstrated that adding carbon black provides a means of 
improving the thermal insulation properties of PU foam. The research showed that PU foam
systems using carbon black in conjunction with either HCFC­141b or cyclopentane was able to 
lower k-factors by six to nine percent in panels and in cabinets.52 
Increased Insulation Thickness 
Based on DOE’s 1995 technical support document (TSD) for refrigerators, refrigerator­
freezers, and freezers, the insulation thickness range for refrigerator­freezers in the mid­1990s 
was 1.5 to 2.75 inches (3.81 to 7.0 cm) in the doors and 1.5 to 3 inches (3.81 to 7.62 cm) in the 
cabinet walls. Walls of freezers and freezer compartments tended to be near the higher end while 
walls of refrigerators and fresh food compartments were nearer the lower end.53 
Also based on the DOE 1995 TSD, adding 0.5 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 cm) more insulation 
increases the overall efficiency of the product. Energy reductions associated with these wall 
thickness increases range from a few percent to over 10 percent. Therefore, DOE considered the 
addition of more insulation as a technology option to improve efficiency. Although the 
technology to implement this change is readily available, manufacturers indicated during the 
rulemaking leading to the April 27, 1997 final rule establishing the current minimum efficiency 
levels that adding insulation would not be the first technology option they would choose to 
improve efficiency. Significant investments would be required in foaming systems, tooling, and 
3­50

molding to accommodate thicker insulation. Increased packaging and shipping costs must also be 
considered. Greater insulation thickness results in either decreased interior volumes, increased 
exterior dimensions, or some combination of both. Since kitchen dimensions and designed 
spaces for refrigerator­freezers are limited, there are restrictions on increasing the exterior size of 
the product. Reducing interior volume is considered undesirable because it impacts consumer 
utility. 
Vacuum-Insulated Panels 
Vacuum­insulated panel (VIPs) technology is based on the reduction in conductivity 
which occurs in a low vacuum, the same concept which is used to reduce heat leakage in thermos 
bottles. VIPs used in refrigeration products consist of a sealed package with a fill material which 
provides support to prevent the panel from collapsing and interferes with molecular mean free 
path as the intermolecular spacing increases at lower vacuum levels. VIPs can be foamed in 
place between the cabinet liner and wrapper to decrease the heat leakage and energy required to 
maintain the cabinet at low temperature. Different configurations are commercially available 
through advances in manufacturing technologies. As a result, VIPs are available in a variety of 
geometries (e.g., flat, curved, cylindrical) with added features (e.g., holes, cut­outs).54 Typical 
VIPs generally consist of a core material and an airtight envelope. Some VIPs also include 
absorber to absorb gas which leaks through the envelope.  
Several core materials have been used in the manufacture of VIPs including polystyrene, 
open­cell PU, silica powder, and glass fiber. Research sponsored by the European Commission 
has evaluated these core materials based on their cost and characteristics, including density and 
manufacturing time. Table  3.3.3 below summarizes the VIP characteristics manufactured with 
the above core materials.55 Each of the core materials has associated advantages and 
disadvantages that dictate their acceptability for an appliance application.

encapsulated in a polymer barrier film; a fibrous glass insulation filler encapsulated in a stainless

ORNL also determined the thermal performance of the VIPs it studied as part of a 
composite panel. The composite panel consisted of a one­inch VIP surrounded by PU foam
insulation to form a two­inch­thick panel. The PU foam insulation was blown with a variety of 
bowing agents, but, due to the age of the study (from the mid­1990s), ORNL considered neither 
HFC­ nor HC­based blowing agents. For the three VIPs presented in Table  3.3.4, silica power, 
glass fiber, and unknown, the average composite panel thermal resistances were 21.5, 20.7, and 
20.9 hr­ft2­ºF/Btu, respectively.56 The lower thermal conductivities reported in Table  3.3.4 for 
the glass fiber and unknown filled VIPs relative to the silica powder VIP were offset by the heat 
conduction through their stainless steel encapsulation material. 
Of significant concern for VIPs is their long­term thermal conductivity integrity. VIP 
thermal conductivity increases dramatically as the pressure within the VIP exceeds 100 Pa abs. 
(1 mbar). The pressure increase in the VIP over time is related to several factors, including: 
residual gases in the VIP after vacuum, degassing from the VIP core material, and gas diffusion 
through the envelope pores. Improved envelopes and absorbers have been developed to prevent 
pressure increases from occurring in VIPs. For example, for the three composite VIPs that it 
analyzed, ORNL measured only a five­percent reduction in overall thermal resistance over a 
three­year period. ORNL demonstrated that this reduction in thermal resistance was less than the 
corresponding reduction for a panel without any VIPs, i.e., panels consisting only of PU foam
insulation.56 
Recent announcements regarding VIPs include the following. Matsushita’s VIP 
technology (trade name of “U­Vacua”) was awarded the Minister of Economy, Trade and 
Industry Prize at the 17th Energy Conservation Awards sponsored by the Energy Conservation 
Center of Japan in January, 2007.57 Matsushita claims that its VIP technology has achieved the 
world’s highest level of insulation efficiency with a thermal conductivity of 1.2 mW/m­K (0.008 
Btu­in/hr­ft2­ºF) at 24 ºC (75.2 ºF).58 Electrolux announced in 2003 the use of VIP technology in 
a freezer that they claimed reduced energy use by 35 percent relative to PU foam insulation.59 
Va­Q­tek has recently introduced its va­Q­plus VIP technology.60 
Gas-Filled Panels 
Gas­filled panels (GFPs) use thin polymer films and low­conductivity gas to create a 
device with excellent thermal insulation properties. GFPs are essentially hermetic plastic bags 
that can take on a variety of shapes and sizes. Inside the outer barrier is a cellular structure called 
a baffle which is filled with the low­conductivity gas.  
Research conducted at LBNL in the mid­1990s has demonstrated the effectiveness of 
GFPs based on the use of different gases, including xenon and krypton. Table  3.3.5 below 
summarizes the thermal performance characteristics of different GFPs, based on their center­of­

panel and whole­panel performance.61 LBNL has also conducted research to demonstrate that 
GFPs, when used in refrigerator­freezers, can reduce energy consumption by approximately 
eight percent relative to PU foam insulation.62

In addition, ORNL determined the thermal conductivity of an insulation panel containing 
radiation baffles within a polymer barrier film and filled with krypton gas at atmospheric 
pressure. The range of thermal conductivities of nine of these GFPs ranged from 0.088 to 0.092 
Btu­in/hr­ft2­ºF (12.6 to 13.2 mW/m­K). ORNL also analyzed the GFPs as part of a composite 
assembly consisting of a one­inch panel surrounded by PU foam insulation to form a two­inch­
thick panel. The average composite panel thermal resistance was determined to be 18.2 hr­ft2­
ºF/Btu. Finally, ORNL measured only a five­percent reduction in overall thermal resistance over 
a three­year period, which was less than the reduction observed in a panel consisting only of PU 
foam insulation.56 
Although research has demonstrated that GFPs have better thermal performance than PU 
foam insulation, no known refrigeration products are using the technology. A significant problem 
in using GFPs is their lack of structural integrity in the resulting product.  
3.3.2.2  Gasket and Door Design 
A significant portion of the heat gain to refrigerators and freezers occurs around the edges 
of the doors and through the gaskets on the door edges. An analysis of thermal loads on an 18.6 
ft3 top­mount refrigerator­freezer revealed that over 28 percent of the total heat load into the 
cabinet came from ‘edge’ loads, i.e., loads due to heat transfer into the food compartments via 
paths around the perimeter of the cabinet aperture.49 Table 3.3.6 summarizes the various ‘edge’ 
loads as well as the heat loads through the walls and doors and other sources. If the ‘edge’ effect 
losses can be reduced, the efficiency of the refrigerator can be increased. This section only 
addresses the ‘edge’ effect loads from the wall and door flanges and the door gasket. Heat loads 
from the anti­sweat heaters are discussed in the following section (section 3.11.2.3).

Improved Gaskets 
Design of door gaskets is a balance between improving the thermal­efficiency 
performance of the gasket and ensuring that the door is not difficult to open. If the gasket magnet 
force is too strong, it becomes difficult to open the door. Based on a European Commission 
study, door handles have been designed specifically to facilitate door openings by providing 
leverage and relieving the pressure differential which can build up by freeing a small section of 
the gasket before the door is opened.55 Although materials and designs for improving the air 
tightness of door gaskets exist, apparently no general criteria have been established to enable 
different designs to be classified. 
An EPA report from 1992 describes theoretical modeling and experimental research on 
gasket heat loads and concludes that replacing about half of either the metal door flange or 
cabinet flange with plastic can reduce the heat flow through the gasket region by 25 percent.63 
However, this study did not address the impacts on the convection on the cabinet side of the 
gasket associated with different geometries of the “throat” region between the door dikes and the 
cabinet wedge or with different evaporator air flow rates. Based on DOE’s 1995 TSD, 
improvements in gasket design can reduce refrigerator­freezer annual energy consumption by 
one to three percent.53 Due to the age of both the EPA and DOE research, it is uncertain how 
much further gaskets can be improved. 
Double Door Gaskets 
A double door gasket is an additional inner door seal gasket that is added to the gasket 
design. This further reduces heat leakage and infiltration into the refrigerator and freezer. 
Based on information drawn from DOE’s 1995 TSD, manufacturers did not introduce 
double door gaskets in the mid­1990s because of performance problems and cost. Ice can form
between the gaskets, greatly reducing their effectiveness. In addition, the gaskets are visually 
unattractive and they increase the difficulty of meeting safety regulations for minimum door­
opening force.

Improved Door Face Frame 
As discussed above, cabinet heat loads stem not only from conduction though the 
refrigerator walls but also from conduction along the external metal casing. The metal shell 
provides the structural integrity; however, its presence means that heat loads are transferred 
along the metal shell into the cabinet. This heat transfer into the cabinet is also referred to as the 
‘edge effect.’ 
Using a plastic cover on the internal flange can reduce the ‘edge effect’ heat losses by 
approximately 50 percent.49 It is expected that the use of low­conductivity plastics to reduce 
conduction losses in this area are already being employed in most current U.S. refrigerator­
freezer designs. 
Reduced Heat Load for TTD Feature 
Through­the­door features that provide ice and/or water service displace insulation in the 
door. These features can make it difficult to apply foam in the doors. This technology option, 
which is applicable only to those product classes that include TTD ice service, utilizes improved 
design methods to reduce the heat load of TTD features. 
Based on the DOE 1995 TSD, door­design improvements that reduce the heat load from
TTD features can reduce refrigerator­freezer annual energy consumption from two to four 
percent.53 The TSD provided little explanation of the details of these design changes, citing only 
“foam insulation” and “improved design methods”. 
3.3.2.3  Anti­Sweat Heater 
Anti­sweat heaters are commonly used in standard­size refrigerator­freezers. In general, 
compact refrigerators, compact refrigerator­freezers, and compact freezers do not use anti­sweat 
heat. These heaters apply heat to external surfaces near door gaskets, including the mullion 
region between the freezer and fresh food compartments and along the perimeter of the cabinet. 
If electric resistance heaters are used for this purpose, the heaters contribute to energy 
consumption both with their wattage input and with the heat load they generate that enters the 
cabinet. Most modern refrigerator­freezers use refrigerant tubes inserted in the cabinets in close 
proximity to the regions requiring heat. Both hot discharge gas from the compressor and warm
liquid leaving the condenser are used to provide this heat, although a majority of products use 
warm liquid. As reported above in section 3.11.2.2, the heat loads from both electric and 
refrigerant type anti­sweat heaters can be significant. For the example illustrated in Table  3.3.6, 
the contribution of the mullion anti­sweat heater represents 7.7 percent of the total cabinet heat 
load. However, the load associated with the anti­sweat heater of modern designs may be lower 
due to evolution of design practices to reduce such loads. 
Hot Gas or Warm Liquid 
The direct electricity consumption of the anti­sweat heaters can be eliminated by using a 
hot gas or warm liquid refrigerant loop to warm external surfaces to eliminate moisture buildup. 
This approach is used extensively in residential refrigerator­freezers to reduce energy use—the 
technology is already part of all or nearly all standard­size refrigerator­freezers.

Electric Heater Sizing 
For those products using electric resistance anti­sweat heaters, unnecessarily high­
wattage heaters may be used. Therefore, energy use can be decreased by reducing the heater 
wattage. For those products that still use electric resistance anti­sweat heaters, DOE is unaware 
to what extent the wattage of the heater is excessive.  
Electric Heater Controls including Variable Antisweat 
For those products using electric resistance anti­sweat heaters, control schemes can be 
used to limit the amount of energy used. One option, which is included on some current 
refrigerator­freezer models, is to use an on­off switch that allows the user to turn off the heater if 
“sweating” is not an issue. The DOE Energy test procedure calls for testing with the switch in the
on position in order to measure annual energy use.64 However, DOE understands that most 
manufacturers measure annual energy use as an average of a test with the heater on and a test 
with the heater off.
Another option is to control the anti­sweat heater based on temperature and humidity 
conditions. As discussed in section  3.2.2.2, DOE is considering incorporating into the test 
procedure for refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers an adaptation of a test procedure for which a 
waiver was granted to GE. The waiver provides a method for calculating the annual energy use 
contribution of electric anti­sweat heaters which are controlled to operate only as much as 
needed to avoid moisture accumulation, based on the input of ambient temperature and/or 
humidity sensors.6 
3.3.2.4  Compressor 
The compressor is the primary energy­consuming component in a refrigerator, 
refrigerator­freezer, or freezer. Therefore, technologies that can advance compressor efficiency 
have a significant effect on overall product efficiency. 
Residential refrigeration products use positive­displacement compressors in which the 
entire motor­compressor is hermetically sealed in the welded steel shell. Two types of 
compressors have been used in residential refrigeration products over the years—reciprocating 
and rotary. However, predominantly reciprocating compressors are now used in U.S. products.  
Almost all compressors are directly driven by two­pole squirrel­cage induction motors 
running at approximately 3,000 rpm on 60 Hz power. Three types of induction motors have been 
used in refrigerator compressors: resistance start/induction run (RSIR), capacitor start/induction 
run (CSIR), and resistance start/capacitor run (RSCR). Of the three motor types, the RSIR motor 
is the least efficient. As a result of the U.S. energy efficiency standards that took effect in 1993 
and 2001, the vast majority of compressor motors now use the RSCR type.  
Refrigerator compressor capacities range from as low as 125 Btu/hr (for compact 
refrigerators) to as high as 2,000 Btu/hr, although maximum capacities are more typically 950 
Btu/hr for U.S. residential refrigerator­freezers. Two organizations have established conditions 
for rating the performance of refrigerator compressors: ASHRAE and Comité Européen des 
3­56

Constructeurs de Matériel Frigorifique (CECOMAF).f Table 3.3.7 below shows the rating 
conditions of these two organizations. The rating conditions are almost identical, except for the 
liquid temperature—this is the temperature leaving the condenser or any subcooling loop such as 
an anti­sweat heating loop. Because the CECOMAF liquid temperature is higher, compressor 
capacities and efficiencies under ASHRAE rating conditions are approximately 30 percent 
higher than for CECOMAF conditions. The actual operating conditions for compressors in 
residential refrigeration products under DOE energy test conditions can be significantly different 
than these rating conditions. Most notably, the condensing temperatures are generally 
significantly lower than 130 ˚F.

Rating Condition  ASHRAE  CECOMAF

Liquid  90 ºF (32.2 ºC)  131 ºF (55 ºC) 
Compressor efficiency is also a function of refrigeration capacity. Based on data from 
DOE’s 1995 TSD, maximum expected compressor efficiencies for the year 1998 demonstrated 
that efficiency drops off with decreasing cooling capacity.53 The expected maximum compressor 
efficiencies for the year 1998 as reported in the 1995 TSD are shown below in Table  3.3.8 
below. A year 2000 European Commission study to support energy standards of domestic 
refrigeration appliances also noted the drop in efficiency as capacity drops.55 The reduced 
efficiency for lower­capacity compressors has been attributed to optimization of performance for 
higher­capacity compressors65 and to the higher importance of mechanical losses and losses 
associated with re­expansion of gases left in the clearance volume as the swept volume of the 
reciprocating piston decreases. 
f CECOMAF is a European appliance manufacturer trade association formed in 1958. It merged with EUROVENT 
in 1996 to become EUROVENT/CECOMAF. This organization is now called EUROVENT.

* Performance based on ASHRAE rating conditions. Performance based on the use of refrigerant R­134a. 
More recent compressor performance data was collected as part of the engineering 
analysis, and the results of this investigation is presented in Chapter 5. The highest efficiency 
single­speed compressors available for standard­size refrigerator­freezers have EER near 6.25 
Btu/hr­W.   
Improved Compressor Efficiency 
Conversion to high­efficiency compressors is fairly straightforward for manufacturers to 
implement as long as the appropriate compressors are available. As indicated above, maximum
efficiencies for compressors that are utilized in the most common types of U.S. refrigerator­
freezers range to near 6.25 Btu/hr­W.  
Variable-Speed Compressors 
Variable­speed compressors allow efficiency improvement as compared to single­speed 
compressors since they can provide a better match of thermal loads during the vast majority of
hours when the loads are low. Most of the time, the compressor would operate at low speed with 
a high percentage of on­time. This would lower energy consumption by reducing off­cycle losses 
and by allowing the heat exchangers to operate with lower mass flow, thus boosting their 
effectiveness. However, careful consideration must be given to how variable speed compressors 
are implemented, because increased fan run times could negate compressor energy savings. 
Electronics are used by variable­speed compressors to vary the speed. They use either inverter­
driven induction motors or permanent magnet motors. Most U.S. residential refrigeration 
products do not currently use variable­speed compressors, but the use of these compressors is 
becoming more common.  
Various past studies have illustrated a range of energy savings achievable through use of 
variable speed compressors. Arthur D. Little reported savings of approximately 25 percent 
compared to single­speed motor systems in 1999.66 Research conducted by Tecumseh Products 
Company demonstrated that energy savings of 15 percent as well as reduction of sound and

vibration levels.67 Simulation analyses conducted at the University of Illinois demonstrated that 
steady­energy savings ranging from four to 14 percent could be realized through the use of a 
two­speed compressor in concert with multiple­speed evaporator and condenser fans. The 
research also demonstrated that an additional 0.5 to four percent in energy consumption could be 
saved through the reduction of cycling frequency, i.e. the number of starts.68 
Embraco has developed its third generation variable­speed compressor that utilizes a 
permanent magnet motor controlled by a programmable electronic unit.69 Table 3.3.9 presents 
the rated performance of some of Embraco’s variable­speed compressors. The rated efficiencies 
of these variable­speed compressors are not necessarily higher than the best efficiencies of 
single­speed compressors­­evaluation of the benefits of variable­speed compressors requires 
consideration of the system performance rather than just rated performance.

Linear Compressors 
Linear compressors employ a different design than either reciprocating or rotary 
compressors and are reportedly more efficient than either. These compressors use a linear rather 
than rotary motor, thus eliminating the crankshaft and linkage which converts the rotary motion 
to the linear motion of the piston of a reciprocating compressor. Elimination of the mechanical
linkage reduces friction and side­forces. The linear motor requires power electronics and a 
controller to assure proper piston throw. Most linear compressor designs use a free piston 
arrangement and can be controlled for a range of capacities through adjustment of piston 
displacement. Early work on the concept suggested that the compressors can operate without 
requiring oil, which could provide additional energy benefit by improving heat transfer in the 
evaporator. Refrigerator noise levels can also be reduced by utilizing linear compressors in the 
same way that this can be done with variable­speed compressors, by operating most of the time 
at low capacity.70 
An early version of the linear compressor design was developed by Sunpower for 
integration into refrigerators for the European market using isobutene (R­600a) as a refrigerant.71 
LG has developed a linear compressor for household refrigerators which does require use of oil. 
LG claims that its line of linear compressors is up to 20 percent more efficient than reciprocating
designs.72 Table 3.3.10 presents the rated efficiencies of LG’s linear compressors.73 LG reports 
the efficiency of its linear compressors only at “LG Reference Conditions,” which are 
significantly different than the ASHRAE rating conditions. Under ASHRAE conditions, 
compressors are rated with evaporating and condensing temperatures of ­10ºF (­23.3ºC) and 
130ºF (54.4ºC), respectively, while the “LG Reference Conditions” are based on evaporating and 
3­59  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
condensing temperatures of ­14.8ºF (­26ºC) and 100.4ºF (38ºC), respectively. It is not clear what 
the liquid and suction vapor temperatures for the LG conditions are—these temperatures also 
impact capacity and power input. At the same evaporating and condensing temperatures and with 
liquid and suction vapor conditions consistent with the ASHRAE test conditions, a high 
efficiency rotating­shaft reciprocating compressor such as the Embraco EGX70HLC would have 
an operating EER of about 6.9 Btu/hr­W. Hence, the LG linear compressor may be about 9% 
more efficient than the best current­technology rotating­shaft reciprocating compressors.

In the trade press, LG has expressed willingness to license the linear compressor 
technology to competitors.74 However, because the LG design is proprietary, the widespread use

3.3.2.5  Evaporator 
The evaporator is a key component of the refrigeration system. As discussed earlier in 
section 3.11.2, there are three basic evaporator designs depending on the refrigeration product: 
standard­size refrigerator­freezers and upright freezers with automatic defrost typically use a 
forced­convection finned­tube design; compact refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers and small­
size standard refrigerator­freezers generally use a roll­bond design; and chest freezers and 
upright freezers with manual defrost typically use a coil design that is integrated within the walls 
of the unit. Some manual defrost freezers also use evaporators which are integrated with the wire 
shelving. In the case of the finned­tube designs used in standard­size refrigerator­freezers, 
design, modeling, and experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate their heat transfer 
performance.75, 76 Evaporator performance can be enhanced by increasing the heat exchanger 
surface area or improving the heat exchange performance.  
Increased Surface Area
Increasing the heat exchanger surface area can be achieved by increasing the face area of 
the evaporator or adding more tube rows. These measures are limited by the geometry of the 
refrigeration product. There is a tradeoff between increasing the volume occupied by the heat 
exchanger and reducing the interior volume of the refrigerator. 
In its 1995 TSD, DOE considered increasing the evaporator surface area for most of the 
product classes analyzed; this resulted in an estimated one to two percent reduction in annual 
energy consumption.53 In the 1995 TSD, DOE based cost and efficiency improvements for this

technology on estimates by manufacturers. No details were provided on how exactly the 
evaporator surface area was increased. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent design efforts to 
increase the evaporator surface area have been employed in current U.S. refrigerator­freezer 
designs. 
Improved Heat Exchange 
Improving heat exchanger performance can be achieved through the use of enhanced fins 
and/or tubes. These types of fin and tube enhancements are common in air­conditioning 
applications where slit and louvered designs are used to enhance the fin surface and different 
types of internally­grooved surfaces are used to enhance the tubing. In its 1995 TSD, DOE 
considered enhancing the evaporator’s heat exchange performance for many of the product 
classes analyzed; this resulted in an estimated one to two percent reduction in annual energy 
consumption.53 In the 1995 TSD, DOE based cost and efficiency improvements for this 
technology on estimates by manufacturers. No details were provided on how exactly the 
evaporator heat exchange performance was enhanced. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent 
design efforts to enhance the evaporator heat exchange performance have been employed in 
current U.S. refrigerator, refrigerator­freezer, and freezer designs. 
Heat exchanger technologies that could potentially improve evaporator performance are 
microchannel heat exchangers, electrohydrodynamic enhancement, and the adoption of phase­
change materials. In the case of microchannel heat exchangers, past research has demonstrated 
that the use of such heat exchangers in domestic refrigerators can provide system efficiencies 
comparable to current technologies while reducing refrigerant charge.77 Electrohydrodynamic 
enhancement employs high­voltage fields to improve the heat exchange performance. However, 
safety issues involved in using such high voltages in domestic appliances have not yet been 
resolved. In addition, no prototypes are available to test and evaluate this technology for 
domestic refrigerators and freezers. Finally, with regard to phase­change materials, Thomson (a 
French manufacturer) has integrated into its heat exchangers a phase­change material that 
enables higher average evaporation temperatures than conventional designs, thereby yielding 
energy savings.55 It is unclear for any of these technologies whether they will ever achieve 
widespread use in refrigerator­freezers. 
Research has also been conducted on the use of a ground­source heat exchanger as a 
means of rejecting heat from the cabinet and improving the efficiency of a refrigerator­freezer. 
Although the use of such a design reduced energy consumption considerably, it is likely not 
practical for most domestic refrigeration products.78 
3.3.2.6  Condenser 
The condenser, like the evaporator, is a key component of the refrigeration system and is 
located on the outside of the unit. As discussed in section 11.1.2, there are three basic condenser 
designs depending on the refrigeration product: Standard­size refrigerator­freezers typically use a 
forced­convection finned­tube design; compact refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers generally 
use a wire­and­tube “static” design which uses natural convection cooling; and freezers typically 
use a hot wall condenser that is integrated within the shell of the unit. In the case of the static 
condensers used in compact units, modeling studies have been conducted to evaluate their heat 
3­61

transfer performance.79 Modeling studies have also been performed on hot­wall condensers.80, 81 
Condenser performance can be enhanced by increasing the heat exchanger surface area or 
improving the heat exchange performance.  
Increased Surface Area
Increasing the heat exchanger surface area can be achieved by increasing the face area of 
the condenser or adding more tube rows. These measures can be limited by the geometry of the 
refrigeration product. There may be a tradeoff between increasing the volume occupied be by the 
heat exchanger and reducing the interior volume of the refrigerator. 
In its 1995 TSD, DOE considered increasing the condenser surface area for many of the 
product classes analyzed; this resulted in an estimated one to two percent reduction in annual 
energy consumption.53 In the 1995 TSD, DOE based cost and efficiency improvements for this 
technology on estimates by manufacturers. No details were provided on how exactly the 
condenser surface area was increased. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent design efforts to 
increase the condenser surface area have been employed in current U.S. refrigerator­freezer 
designs. 
Improved Heat Exchange 
Improving heat exchanger performance can be achieved through the use of enhanced fins 
and/or tubes. These types of fin and tube enhancements are common in air­conditioning 
applications where slit and louvered designs are used to enhance the fin surface and different 
types of internally grooved surfaces are used to enhance the tubing. In its 1995 TSD, DOE 
considered enhancing the condenser’s heat exchange performance for some freezer and compact 
unit product classes; this resulted in approximately a two percent estimated reduction in annual 
energy consumption.53 In the 1995 TSD, DOE based cost and efficiency improvements for this 
technology on estimates by manufacturers. No details were provided on how exactly the 
condenser heat exchange performance was enhanced. Therefore, it is uncertain to what extent 
design efforts to enhance the condenser heat exchange performance have been employed in 
current U.S. refrigerator, refrigerator­freezer, and freezer designs. 
As with evaporators, other heat exchanger technologies could be employed to improve 
condenser performance. Microchannel heat exchangers, electrohydrodynamic enhancement, and 
the adoption of phase­change materials are all applicable to condensers, although phase­change 
materials have only been used in evaporators. It is unclear for any of these technologies whether 
they will ever achieve widespread use in refrigerator­freezers. 
The same research that investigated the use of ground­source heat exchangers as means 
of rejecting heat for the cabinet also examined its application for rejecting heat from the 
condenser. The technology was demonstrated to be effective at reducing the energy use of a 
refrigerator­freezer, but is likely not practical for most domestic refrigeration products.55 
Forced-Convection Condenser 
Most standard­size refrigerator­freezers use forced­convection condensers. In contrast, most 
standard­size freezers use hot wall condensers. The forced convection configuration can provide
3­62  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher heat transfer effectiveness. However, space for housing a forced convection condenser 
and its associated fan is not always available. The consideration of conversion to forced­
convection condensers will depend on whether a particular product class is designed in a way 
that allows housing of the condenser and fan in a suitable location. 
3.3.2.7  Fan and Fan Motor 
Fans are used to increase evaporator and condenser heat transfer. Because most 
refrigerator­freezers use forced­convection condensers which rely on fans for air movement, fan 
and fan­motor technology options for the condenser are applicable. However, many manual­
defrost refrigerators and freezers—specifically chest freezers and small, under­counter­type 
refrigerators—use static condensers and/or natural convection evaporators and, as a result, do not 
use fans and fan motors.
For those refrigeration products that do utilize fans, refrigerator manufacturers purchase 
fans and fan motors from outside vendors. Therefore, conversion to more­efficient fan motors 
can be accomplished relatively easily when more­efficient fans and fan motors are available.  
Fan and Fan Motor Improvements 
Evaporator can condenser fans are typically of axial design. Evaporator fan blades are 
typically either 100mm or 110mm in diameter. Because the evaporator fan and fan motor are 
located within the refrigerated cabinet and the electric energy input adds to the refrigeration load, 
more­efficient evaporator fan or evaporator fan motor designs contribute to efficiency 
improvements in two ways: (1) reducing the power consumption of the fan motor and (2) 
reducing the power consumption of the compressor due to decreased heat losses into the cabinet
from the fan motor.  
One source of inefficiency for axial fans lies in their tendency to throw air outward. The 
Pax Group™ has developed a fan (PAX fan) that employs streamlined blades with patented 
geometrical shapes which reportedly provide better airflow direction and improved efficiency. 
Tests performed with the PAX fan have demonstrated a reduction in fan­motor power of 23 
percent and an overall reduction in refrigerator energy consumption of 3.9 percent relative to a 
refrigerator with a typical axial fan blade design.82 However, because the PAX fan is proprietary, 
the widespread use of the design is highly uncertain. 
Before the 1993 U.S. energy efficiency standards took effect, most evaporator and 
condenser fan motors were shaded pole induction designs, with efficiencies between 10 and 15 
percent and power input of about 15 Watts (W). Higher­efficiency motor designs include 
permanent split capacitor motors (PSC) induction motors with 20 to 30 percent efficiency, and 
brushless DC motors, with near 65 percent efficiency.  
3.3.2.8  Expansion Valve 
The metering device in most household refrigerator­freezers is a capillary tube. As 
discussed above in section 11.1.1, there are two common types of capillary tubes—adiabatic and 
non­adiabatic. In the non­adiabatic configuration, the capillary tube is soldered to the suction line 
3­63  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to evaporate the residual liquid in the suction line and to warm the vapor to near­ambient 
temperature. The suction line heat exchanger (or the non­adiabatic capillary) improves efficiency 
because it increases the refrigeration capacity of the system by the amount of heat being 
transferred from the capillary to the suction side. Non­adiabatic capillary tubes are the most 
common type of metering device in refrigerator­freezers. The other type of metering device, an 
adiabatic capillary tube, is used in some refrigeration products. In this configuration, the 
capillary tube does not exchange heat with the suction line and the refrigerant expands from the 
high pressure to the low pressure adiabatically. Research has been conducted to develop models 
to study the performance of both types of capillary tubes.83, 84 
Improved Expansion Valve  
Automatic, adjustable thermostatic or electronic expansion valves may provide improved 
performance. The technology for this design option is available; however, a modification in 
system design is required. DOE has not be able to identify any data demonstrating that improved 
expansion valves will save energy in domestic refrigerators. 
3.3.2.9  Cycling Losses 
Off­cycle refrigerant migration reduces a refrigeration product’s efficiency by 
transferring heat from outside the cabinet into the evaporator. Changes in refrigerator design that 
reduce this aspect of cycling losses can increase the unit’s efficiency. 
Fluid Control or Solenoid Valve 
A fluid control or solenoid valve installed after the condenser to effectively isolate the 
evaporator from the condenser during the off­cycle can be used to prevent any refrigerant 
migration. Research has demonstrated that solenoid valves can yield substantial energy 
savings.85 However, there are drawbacks to using solenoid valves. First, refrigeration migration 
allows the system pressure to equalize, reducing the required starting torque of the compressor 
motor. A solenoid valve would increase the required starting torque of the compressor motor. 
Second, adding such a valve could negatively affect system reliability. 
3.3.2.10  Defrost System 
Section 3.11.1.2 provides a description of typical automatic defrost systems for 
refrigerator­freezers. Most units use electric heaters to defrost the ice buildup on the evaporator
located in the freezer section of a refrigerator­freezer. Energy use associated with defrost 
includes the energy input for the heater and also the refrigeration system energy used to remove 
the defrost heat from the cabinet.  
Reduced Energy for Automatic Defrost 
In some cases, the defrost heat supplied is more than required. Thus, energy savings can 
be achieved by reducing the defrost heat by either using a smaller heater, reducing the heater on­
time, reducing the frequency of defrost, or a combination of these.  
In its 1995 TSD, DOE found that most manufacturers had already significantly reduced 
the electric heat for auto defrost in order to comply with the energy efficiency standards that 
3­64  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
became effective in 1993.53 There may be limited additional energy savings possible through 
optimization of automatic defrost.  
Adaptive Defrost 
To reduce the energy used for defrost, adaptive defrost can be used. An adaptive defrost 
system can control both the defrost time and the amount of defrost heat. Adaptive defrost 
systems make use of controls to adjust the time between defrost cycles to the appropriate amount 
for the door opening frequency, ambient conditions, and other consumer usage patterns which 
affect the introduction of moisture into the cabinet. In a typical automatic defrost system, a 
mechanical timer initiates defrost after a specified time period, usually 10 to 12 hours of 
compressor on­time. By allowing adjustment of the time between defrosts, energy use can be 
reduced. The DOE energy test procedure includes modified test procedures for evaluating the 
energy use of products with adaptive defrost. In its 1995 TSD, DOE estimated that energy 
consumption can be reduced by three to four percent with adaptive defrost.53 It is unclear what 
percentage of the refrigerator market currently uses adaptive defrost. 
Condenser Hot Gas 
Another method of reducing the energy required for defrost is to eliminate the need for 
electric heaters by substituting condenser hot gas in their place. In a condenser hot gas defrost 
system, the compressor continues to run and a valve opens allowing hot compressed refrigerant 
to flow to the evaporator. Many frost­free refrigerator­freezers in the 1960s and 1970s used such 
a defrost system.  
3.3.2.11  Control System 
The control systems discussed here pertain to those controlling the temperature and air­
distribution within the refrigeration product.  
Temperature Control 
Conventional thermostats are thermomechanical devices that are not very accurate. The 
inaccuracy of these devices may produce large temperature fluctuations within the cabinet and, 
in turn, thermodynamic inefficiencies. Electronic thermostats are available that can provide more 
precise and repeatable temperature control than conventional thermostats. This can result in 
improved efficiency. Electronic thermostat systems can also account for more parameters than 
just the cabinet temperature, such as the room temperature, to better regulate product operation 
and reduce compressor run times.  
Air-Distribution Control 
  For refrigerator­freezers, better air distribution between the freezer and fresh food 
compartments can improve temperature control and reduce energy consumption. Improving the 
distribution of cold air within the refrigerator­freezer allows the temperature difference between 
the air and foodstuffs to be minimized, enabling the evaporation temperature to be raised and, 
thereby, reducing energy consumption. It is uncertain to what degree the air distribution control 
in current refrigerator­freezer models can be improved. However, the fact that several patents 
3­65  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have been issued in the U.S. since 1995 regarding air distribution implies that improvements in 
air distribution control are possible.55 
3.3.2.12  Other Technologies 
Alternative refrigerants and changing the location of refrigeration components can also 
improve the efficiency of refrigeration products. These two technology options are discussed 
below. 
Alternative Refrigerants 
Through the 1980s, CFC­12, a chlorofluorocarbon, was used as the refrigerant in almost 
all refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, and freezers. However, under the Montreal Protocol, all 
CFCs were banned from use by the mid­1990s due to their high ozone depletion potential (ODP). 
In the early 1990s, many alternative refrigerants were evaluated as a replacement for CFC­12. Of 
the alternatives considered, the industry settled on HFC­134a as the replacement for CFC­12. 
Although initial research demonstrated that HFC­134a as a drop­in replacement yielded 
efficiencies which were four to 10 percent less than CFC­12, further work showed that with the 
appropriate superheat and subcooling taken into consideration, HFC­134a could yield essentially 
equivalent system efficiencies as CFC­12.86 
Because HFC­134a exhibits some global warming potential (GWP), research continued 
to find an alternative refrigerant with less or no GWP. For example, R­152a has a lower GWP 
than HFC­134a but, primarily due to flammability concerns and the potential liability issues it 
posed to refrigerator manufacturers, it was dismissed as a potential alternative. 
Naturally occurring substances such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, and hydrocarbons are 
all considered to be environmentally safe refrigerants with very low GWP. Hydrocarbons in 
particular are attractive due to their similar thermodynamic properties to CFC­12. Much research 
has been conducted showing the efficiency benefits of hydrocarbons. For example, the 
performance of propane/isobutane and propane/butane mixtures in domestic refrigerators has 
been shown to be equal to or better than products using CFC­12.87, 88 Hydrocarbon flammability 
has been pointed out as a significant drawback and has prevented their adoption in U.S. products. 
In contrast, European refrigerator manufacturers started manufacturing products with isobutane 
in the 1990s. However, recently the General Electric Company announced the intention to 
introduce this refrigerant in the U.S.89 
Component Location 
In its 1995 TSD, DOE saw energy savings potential in more optimal placement of certain 
components. For example, if the compressor and condenser are located on the top of the 
refrigerator­freezer, DOE determined that they can operate more efficiently because heat is more
readily convected away from the system and, in addition, the condenser fan can be eliminated. 
As described previously, traditionally, the compressor and condenser are located at the bottom
rather than the top of the refrigerator­freezer so the user can have easy access to the food 
compartments, to key center of gravity low, and to provide air flow and a heat source near the 
tray which collects defrost water to assure quick re­evaporation of water. Locating the condenser 
and compressor at the top of the unit would require modification of traditional practice and 
3­66

consumer preference. It would also require product redesign, which could potentially increase 
manufacturing costs.  
Another option is to locate the evaporator fan motor outside the cabinet to reduce internal loads 
from the heat loss of the motor. However, it is difficult to prevent air leakage where the motor 
shaft penetrates the cabinet wall. The 1995 TSD concluded that the lack of experimental data 
prevented the evaluation of component relocation.53 
3.3.2.13  Alternative Refrigeration Cycles 
Alternative refrigeration cycles may have the potential to improve system efficiency. 
Several alternative refrigeration cycles for refrigerator­freezers are described below. Dual­loop 
refrigerator­freezers using two independent refrigeration cycles (one for the fresh food 
compartment and the other for the freezer compartment) are available on the market. Also, dual­
evaporator units likely utilizing a control valve system are also being marketed. The other 
alternatives listed below have been demonstrated in prototypes to reduce energy consumption but 
it is uncertain as to whether they can be mass produced as a practical alternative to today’s 
current conventional refrigeration systems. 
Lorenz-Meutzner Cycle 
In a conventional refrigerator­freezer, the temperature of the freezer and fresh food 
compartments are around 5ºF (­15ºC) and 38ºF (3.3ºC), respectively. This suggests that the fresh 
food compartment with a smaller temperature lift (i.e., the temperature difference between the 
evaporator and condenser) can operate with a higher efficiency than that of the freezer. By using 
zeotropicg refrigerant mixtures, the Lorenz­Meutzner cycle exploits the inherent thermodynamic 
advantages of the temperature glide exhibited during evaporation or condensation of the 
refrigerant mixture. By choosing a refrigerant mixture with very wide temperature glide, the 
refrigerant mixture can pass sequentially through the freezer and fresh food compartment 
evaporators, providing refrigeration at the two evaporating temperature levels using a single 
compressor. As compared to a conventional refrigerator­freezer, the hardware differences 
include a high­temperature evaporator for the fresh food compartment and a low­temperature 
heat exchanger between the fresh food and freezer evaporators. Lorenz and Meutzner in their 
research determined that their cycle using an R­22/R­11 refrigerant mixture (50 percent of each) 
achieved up to 20 percent energy savings compared to a conventional refrigerator­freezer using 
R­12 only.90 
Subsequent research validated Lorenz and Meutzner’s findings and demonstrated the 
viability of the cycle based on the use of different zeotropic refrigerant mixtures, including 
mixtures composed of hydrocarbons. For example, as compared to a conventional refrigerator­
freezer, experimentation on an 18 ft3 top­mount refrigerator­freezer demonstrated that a modified 
g A zeotropic mixture consists of two or more refrigerant components. Zeotropic mixtures have what is referred to as
a temperature glide when they boil and condense: at a fixed pressure, the temperature is higher for higher quality 
(i.e. vapor fraction). Unlike zeotropes, azeotropic mixtures consist of two or more refrigerant components that
behave like a single refrigerant, exhibiting no temperature glide.

Lorenz­Meutzner cycle yielded 16.6 percent, 14.6 percent, and 16.7 percent energy savings with 
binary mixtures of R­22/R­123, propane/n­pentane, and propane/n­butane, respectively.91 
Because the industry settled on the use of HFC­134a to replace CFC­12, interest in the 
Lorenz­Meutzner cycle as an alternative to conventional refrigeration cycles declined. 
Dual-Loop System 
One of the best methods to reduce the thermodynamic irreversibilities resulting from the 
operation with a single evaporator in a refrigerator­freezer is to employ two separate 
refrigeration cycles. This system, referred to as a dual­loop system, has two completely separate 
refrigeration cycles which provide cooling for the freezer and fresh food compartments 
independently. In practice, the theoretical benefits of such a cycle are not achieved due to the use 
of two compressors that are smaller and less efficient than the original single compressor. Also, 
dual­loop systems are physically larger and would either increase the product’s external 
dimensions or decrease the usable refrigerator volume.  
Research has demonstrated that the energy savings due to a dual­loop system are a 
function of the cabinet load ratio (defined as the ratio of the fresh food to the freezer cabinet 
loads) and the ratio of the freezer and refrigerator cycle efficiencies. Depending on these two 
parameters, a dual­loop system using HFC­134a can reduce energy consumption by up to 30 
percent compared to a conventional refrigerator­freezer.92 
There are numerous products currently on the market that incorporate dual­compressor 
systems, including Bosch’s Integra line of bottom­mount refrigerator­freezers,93 Sun Frost’s 
RF19 model,94 Northland’s 48­inch side­mount refrigerator­freezer,95 Sub­Zero’s built­in line of 
refrigerator­freezers,96 Liebherr refrigerators,97 etc. 
Two-Stage System 
The two­stage system employs one condenser, two evaporators, two compressors, and at 
least one suction­line heat exchanger. The increased efficiency of this system over a 
conventional system is obtained due to a smaller work requirement that results from the low­
pressure ratio for each of the two compressors.98 The two­stage system offers the advantage of 
having one fewer component (a condenser) than the dual­loop system, but has many of the same
disadvantages (e.g., either increased external dimensions or decreased internal volume).  
Control Valve System 
The control valve system has two evaporators, one for the fresh food compartment and 
one for the freezer compartment, but only one compressor and one condenser. Two different 
length capillary tubes and a control valve are installed between the fresh food and freezer 
evaporator inlets and the condenser outlet. The valve directs the flow of the refrigerant through 
one of the evaporators at a time. That is, only one of the two compartments is cooled at any 
given time. With this configuration, the fresh food compartment is cooled at a higher evaporator 
temperature than the freezer compartment. Experimental research conducted on this system
configuration indicated that the energy efficiency can be improved by 8.5 percent over that of a 
conventional refrigerator­freezer.99

GE offers a refrigerator­freezer system called the ClimateKeeper2™ system that uses two 
evaporators.100 Also, KitchenAid and Jenn­Air both offer under­counter compact refrigerator­
freezers that use dual evaporators.101 102 The system details of none of these products is clearly 
described in the product literature.  
Ejector Refrigerator 
One of the intrinsic losses in a conventional refrigeration cycle is the throttling of the 
refrigerant in the capillary tube. Throttling is an isenthalpic process in which work that could be 
extracted in the expansion process is not captured. In the ejector refrigerator, some of this work 
can be captured and used to raise the pressure of refrigerant entering the compressor above that 
of the evaporator. Simulation research has been conducted on an ejector refrigerator that consists 
of one compressor, one condenser, two capillary tubes, two evaporators (one for the fresh food 
compartment and the other for the freezer compartment), and an ejector. In this refrigerator, 
saturated liquid refrigerant exits the condenser and expands in the capillary tube to the fresh food 
evaporator. In the fresh­food compartment, the refrigerant is partially evaporated. At the outlet of 
the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant is separated from the vapor in a separator. The vapor flows 
to the ejector, where it is accelerated to high velocity. The liquid expands in a second capillary 
tube to the freezer evaporator, where it evaporates entirely. The vapor leaving the freezer 
evaporator is entrained in the high­velocity flow of the vapor which left the fresh food 
evaporator. The mixed flow is decelerated to increase its pressure. The mixed flow higher 
pressure flow passes to the compressor suction port to be compressed. This particular ejector 
refrigerator was shown to have an efficiency which is 12.4 percent higher than a conventional 
refrigerator­freezer.103 
Tandem System 
Like the control valve system and the ejector refrigerator, the tandem system uses two 
evaporators (one for the fresh food compartment and another for the freezer compartment), one 
condenser, and one compressor. Refrigerant flows in series first through the fresh food 
evaporator, then the freezer evaporator, and it passes a second time through the fresh food 
evaporator. The warm liquid refrigerant leaves the condenser and flows to fresh food evaporator 
without a first expansion. In the fresh food evaporator the refrigerant liquid undergoes heat 
exchange with the evaporating refrigerant which has passed through the freezer evaporator. The 
temperature of the liquid is reduced by this heat exchange. The liquid then passes through the 
capillary tube where its pressure is reduced. The two­phase refrigerant then passes through the 
freezer evaporator and absorbs heat from the freezer compartment. This vaporization process 
only occurs when the freezer evaporator fan is turned on by the freezer thermostat. The 
refrigerant then passes back through the fresh food evaporator. Here, if the refrigerant has not 
already been vaporized (i.e., the freezer compartment does not require cooling), it vaporizes as a 
result of absorbing heat from the fresh food compartment and the warm liquid. The superheated 
refrigerant then flows to the compressor suction port. At the beginning of the compressor run, the 
fresh­food compartment fan is turned on first. Thus, the fresh food compartment is cooled before 
the system reaches steady state. As a result, the system uses the pull­down period of each cycle, 
which is generally not suitable for cooling the freezer, to cool the fresh food compartment. This 
particular tandem system was shown to reduce energy use by 18 percent compared to a 
conventional refrigerator­freezer.104

3.3.2.14  Alternative Refrigeration Systems
Alternative refrigeration systems do not use vapor compression to provide refrigeration. 
Three alternative refrigeration systems are discussed below: the Stirling cycle, thermoelectric 
cooling, and thermoacoustic cooling. Although research and development has been conducted on 
each of these systems, and thermoelectric compact refrigerators and wine coolers are currently 
being marketed, none are a viable alternative for standard­size refrigerators, refrigerator­freezers, 
and freezers.
Stirling Cycle 
A Stirling­cycle machine is a device that operates on a closed regenerative 
thermodynamic cycle, with cyclic compression and expansion of the working fluid at different 
temperature levels, and where the flow is controlled by volume changes, so that there is a net 
conversion of heat to work or vice versa. ‘Regenerative’ refers to the use of an internal heat 
exchanger, the regenerator, which is an essential part of the Stirling cycle. A Stirling 
refrigeration cycle compresses and expands an inert gas in a single cylinder. Heat is rejected at 
one end of the cylinder and absorbed at the opposite end. In the absence of all thermodynamic 
losses, the efficiency could be higher than for vapor compression systems, but there are various 
technical difficulties that have so far limited the use of Stirling­cycle cooling to small prototype 
domestic refrigerators. There is no circulating refrigerant fluid and the hot and cold heat areas are 
relatively small, which creates heat exchange challenges for any but the lowest­capacity systems.  
Thermoelectric 
Thermoelectric cooling occurs when a current is passed across the junction of two 
dissimilar metals. One side of the device becomes hot and the other cold. Materials 
(semiconductors) have relatively recently been developed that have allowed for the use of this 
type of cooling in some applications. Thermoelectric cooling devices have no moving parts, do 
not age, and have extremely long lifetimes. There are several compact refrigerators and wine 
coolers using thermoelectric cooling that are being marketed, including several models offered 
by Avanti Products.105 However, they have very low efficiency and are not yet suitable for 
standard­size domestic refrigerator­freezers.  
Thermoacoustic 
Acoustic cooling uses a sound generator inside a closed tube to vibrate a gas and cause 
alternate compression and expansion and therefore heating and cooling. The efficiency of 
prototypes have not been as high as vapor compression systems and the devices have been 
physically large for the amount of cooling produced. 
3.3.3  Energy Efficiency 
DOE gathered data on the energy efficiency of residential refrigerators, refrigerator­
freezers, and freezers currently available in the marketplace. DOE created a database of the 
current models by surveying manufacturers’ websites. The data provide an overview of the 
energy efficiency of each product class covered by this rulemaking.

For the models in the DOE database, Figure  3.3.3 through Figure 3.3.22 present by 
product class the relationship between rated annual energy use and adjusted volume. In each 
figure, lines representing the maximum allowable energy consumption (i.e., the current 
minimum efficiency standard) and the current ENERGY STAR level (that took effect in April 
2008 for standard­size refrigerators and refrigerator­freezers), are provided. This allows for a 
quick visual inspection of the number of models that met the ENERGY STAR level.  
The data representing all­refrigerators are highlighted in the figures for product classes 1, 
3, 11, and 13. For product classes 1 and 11, the products which are not all­refrigerators could be 
either basic refrigerators or manual defrost refrigerator­freezers. For product classes 3 and 13, 
the products which are not all­refrigerators are refrigerator­freezers. The percentage of all­
refrigerators is high for product class 11 and very high for product class 13. 
The DOE survey found no current models in product class 6, top­mount refrigerator­
freezers with through the door ice and with automatic defrost. DOE still provides a figure for this
class (Figure 3.3.9) to show the maximum allowable energy consumption for this product class. 
Many of the other product classes also have few products.

CHAPTER 4. SCREENING ANALYSIS  
4.1 INTRODUCTION  
This chapter details the screening analysis that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
conducted in support of the ongoing energy conservation standards rulemakings for refrigerators, 
refrigerator-freezers, and freezers.  
In chapter 3, the market and technology assessment (MTA), DOE presented an initial list 
of technologies that can improve the energy efficiency of residential refrigeration products. The 
purpose of the screening analysis is to evaluate the technologies that improve equipment 
efficiency to determine which technologies to consider further and which to screen out. DOE 
consulted with a range of parties, including industry, technical experts, and others to develop a 
list of technologies for consideration. DOE evaluated the technologies pursuant to the criteria set 
out in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended. (42 U.S.C. 6311-6317) 
Section 325(o) EPCA establishes criteria for prescribing new or amended standards 
designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency. Further, EPCA directs the 
Secretary of Energy to determine whether a standard is technologically feasible and 
economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A), as directed by 42 U.S.C. 6316(a)(1)-(3)). 
EPCA also establishes guidelines for determining whether a standard is economically justified. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)) Appendix A to subpart C of Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, 
Part 430 (10 CFR Part 430), “Procedures, Interpretations and Policies for Consideration of New 
or Revised Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Products” (the Process Rule), sets forth 
procedures to guide DOE in its consideration and promulgation of new or revised equipment 
energy conservation standards. These procedures elaborate on the statutory criteria provided in 
42 U.S.C. 6295(o) and, in part, eliminate problematic technologies early in the process of 
prescribing or amending an energy efficiency standard. In particular sections 4(b)(4) and 5(b) of 
the Process Rule guide DOE in determining whether to eliminate from consideration any 
technology that presents unacceptable problems with respect to the following criteria: 
Technological feasibility. Technologies incorporated in commercial equipment or in 
working prototypes will be considered technologically feasible. 
Practicability to manufacture, install, and service. If mass production of a technology 
in commercial equipment and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could be 
achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the effective date of 
the standard, then that technology will be considered practicable to manufacture, install, and 
service. 
Impacts on equipment utility or equipment availability. If a technology is determined 
to have significant adverse impact on the utility of the equipment to significant subgroups of 
customers, or result in the unavailability of any covered equipment type with performance 
characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as equipment generally available in the United States at the time, it will 
not be considered further.

Adverse impacts on health or safety. If it is determined that a technology will have 
significant adverse impacts on health or safety, it will not be considered further. 
In sum, if DOE determines that a technology, or a combination of technologies, has 
unacceptable impacts on the policies stated in section 5(b) of the Process Rule, it will be 
eliminated from consideration. If a particular technology fails to meet one or more of the four 
criteria, it will be screened out. Section 4.2 documents the reasons for eliminating any 
technology. 
4.2 SCREENED-OUT TECHNOLGIES 
This section describes the technologies that DOE eliminated for failure to meet one of the 
following four factors: (1) technological feasibility; (2) practicability to manufacture, install, and 
service; (3) impacts on equipment utility or equipment availability; and (4) adverse impacts on 
health or safety.  
4.2.1 Improved Resistivity of Insulation
Past research has demonstrated that the resistivity of polyurethane (PU) foam insulation 
can be improved through the use of additives that reduce the thermal conductivity of the foam.  
Research conducted in 1996 demonstrated that adding carbon black provides a means of 
improving the thermal insulation properties of PU foam using both HCFC-141b or cyclopentane 
blowing agents.1 However, DOE is not aware that this process has been adopted by any supplier 
of PU foam insulation or any refrigerator manufacturer. Manufacturers have reported that it 
darkens the interior of a refrigerator lined with white plastic, and it stains anything it contacts.  
Discussion with PU foam insulation vendors indicates that there is work ongoing which 
may lead to improvement in insulation performance but that any such technology would not 
likely be ready for introduction to the market by 2014. Discussion with manufacturers has 
confirmed that there are no available options for improvement in PU foam insulation 
performance (other than reverting to use of banned blowing agents). Due to the lack of available 
information and predictions that there is no significant benefit to be expected from PU foam
improvements, DOE has eliminated this option from consideration in the engineering analysis.  
4.2.2 Gas-Filled Panels 
Investigation of the status of gas-filled panels suggests that there has been some
evaluation of this technology by manufacturers of residential refrigeration equipment, but that no 
manufacturers are using it in their products. The costs are reported to be as high as for vacuum
insulation panels (VIPs), with less reduction in thermal load. DOE has not been able to identify a 
credible supplier that would provide gas filled panel products to the refrigeration industry. DOE 
has eliminated this technology from further consideration.

4.2.3 Improved Gaskets, Double Gaskets, Improved Door Face Frame 
Past investigation on reduction of heat load in the gasket and door face frame area has 
focused on (1) limiting the conduction of heat through metal casing material passing underneath 
the gasket magnet on the cabinet side or in the region of the gasket clip on the door side into the 
cabinet interior, (2) using a gasket which provides additional cover of frame surfaces towards the 
interior of the magnet to prevent cold air from reaching the high-conductivity metal casing near 
the gasket magnet, and (3) providing a long thin “throat” area between the gasket and the interior 
to limit convection heat transfer. Most current designs are effective in addressing these issues. 
Limited information is publicly available which would allow quantification of additional 
improvement potential for the door frame/gasket area of refrigerators. Some manufacturers use 
extra-strong gasket magnets to limit infiltration and thermal loss, but it is unclear whether 
significant thermal improvement is possible with such systems. Manufacturers indicated during 
pre-NOPR discussions that properly designed and installed gasket systems provide a tight seal 
and that there isn’t any further reduction in air leakage that could be achieved with 
improvements in the gasket system such as increasing the magnetic force. In addition, consumer 
safety laws preclude use of excessive door sealing force.  
Based on information drawn from DOE’s 1995 TSD, double door gaskets were not 
adopted by many manufacturers in the mid-1990s because of performance problems and cost. Ice 
has a tendency to form between the gaskets, greatly reducing their effectiveness. In addition, the 
gaskets tend to be visually unattractive and they make it more difficult to meet the consumer 
safety regulations for minimum door-opening force. 
It is expected that incremental improvement may be possible for some products, however, 
the lack of good quantified information on general improvement potential in this area makes this 
technology option unsuitable for consideration as a design option. 
4.2.4 Reduced Heat Load for TTD Feature 
During Pre-NOPR analysis discussions, manufacturers indicated that there is little or no
reduction in load which can be achieved through redesign of TTD features. DOE inspected the 
TTD system of a side-by-side refrigerator and concluded that the load impact of this feature is 
modest. The door insulation thickness is maintained behind the recess except within an inch or 
two of the chute opening, and low-conductivity plastic is used on all surfaces. The chute door 
closes reliably. A calculation of the thermal load suggests that it is on the order of 3W (10 
Btu/hr). The reverse engineering of this feature shows that a 2W electric anti-sweat heater is used 
to prevent condensation of the exterior surfaces nearest the ice chute opening. Manufacturers 
indicated that these load levels are typical for TTD features. Even if the chute door was insulated 
with ½-inch of insulation (which would likely interfere with chute door operation), the load 
impact would be minimal, due to the very low surface area of this door. Based on the very low 
potential for improvement, DOE has eliminated reduced heat load TTD features as an option for 
further analysis.

4.2.5 Warm Liquid or Hot Gas Refrigerant Anti-Sweat Heating 
Although some refrigerators do still use electric anti-sweat heating, the typical anti-sweat 
heater for baseline units, according to the reverse engineering work and discussion with 
manufacturers, is warm liquid refrigerant. A possible exception is French door refrigerators. In 
these products, providing heat to the gasket surfaces which seal between the French doors (or to 
the flip-mullion used in some designs for sealing in this region) is not possible using warm
refrigerant liquid or hot gas. French door refrigerators may use electric anti-sweat heaters in this 
region, but for these products conversion to refrigerant line anti-sweat is impractical. Due to the 
current use of refrigerant-line anti-sweat in situations where it can be used, DOE has eliminated 
this option from further consideration.  
4.2.6 Electric Anti-Sweat Heater Sizing 
Because the baseline products considered in the engineering analysis predominantly use 
warm liquid anti-sweat, the consideration of adjustment of the sizing of electric anti-sweat 
heaters is not relevant. 
4.2.7 Linear Compressors 
While promising potential has been reported for linear compressors, there is very little
information available for commercialized linear compressors that allows confident prediction of 
performance and cost impacts of this technology. Information for some LG linear compressors 
has been reported at “LG Reference Conditions,” which are significantly different than the 
standard ASHRAE rating conditions. Under ASHRAE conditions, compressors are rated at -10 
ºF (-23.3 ºC) evaporating temperature and 130 ºF (54.4 ºC) condensing temperature. The “LG 
Reference Conditions” are based on -14.8 ºF (-26 ºC) evaporating and 100.4 ºF (38 ºC) 
condensing temperatures. It is not clear what the liquid and suction vapor temperatures for the 
LG conditions are—these temperatures also impact capacity and power input. The performance 
of some of LG’s linear compressors at the LG conditions is presented in Table  4.2.1 below. At 
the same evaporating and condensing temperatures and with liquid and suction vapor conditions 
consistent with the ASHRAE test conditions, a high efficiency rotating-shaft reciprocating 
compressor such as the Embraco EGX70HLC would have an operating EER of about 6.9 Btu/hr-
W. Hence, the LG linear compressor may be about 9% more efficient than the best current-
technology rotating-shaft reciprocating compressors.

In the trade press, LG has expressed willingness to license the linear compressor 
technology to competitors.2 However, because the LG design is proprietary, the widespread use 
of linear compressors is highly uncertain. Use of linear compressors in LG refrigerators is less 
explicit in LG product data than it was a few years ago, so it is unclear how many products are 
actually using these compressors. Other compressor manufacturers who have indicated that they 
have investigated linear technology have stated that linear compressor technology does not 
provide a clear path to improved efficiency, and some have indicated that they are no longer 
actively pursuing this technology. Hence, availability of linear compressor technology as an 
option for improved efficiency is uncertain. Further, DOE was not able to obtain cost estimates 
for linear compressors. For these reasons, DOE has eliminated linear compressors from further 
consideration in the analyses. 
4.2.8 Improved Evaporator Heat Exchange 
Improving heat exchanger performance can be achieved through the use of enhanced fins 
and/or tubes. These types of fin and tube enhancements are common in air-conditioning 
applications where slit and louvered designs are used to enhance the fin surface and different 
types of internally-grooved surfaces are used to enhance the tubing. Application of similar 
enhancements in refrigerator evaporators is complicated by frost accumulation on the 
evaporators. Effectiveness of the fine slit and louver features for refrigerator evaporators is 
dubious because they would be blocked quickly with frost. In order to avoid the energy use 
associated with frequent defrost, fin spacing in refrigerator evaporators is comparatively sparse. 
This allows the evaporator to work effectively without blocking airflow with a considerable 
accumulation of frost. During defrost, the typical flat fin design of these evaporators assures that 
the frost slides rapidly off the fins and doesn’t get stuck on fin enhancement features. During 
discussions with manufacturers, little indication was provided that efficiency could significantly 
be enhanced through the use of fin or tube enhancements. DOE has eliminated this option from
consideration in subsequent analysis. 
4.2.9 Improved Condenser Heat Exchange 
Use of heat exchanger enhancements for the condenser are complicated by the need for 
adequate performance when the heat exchanger has not been cleaned. Most refrigerator 
condensers (other than hot wall condensers integrated into the outer shells of the products) are 
made of steel tubes and steel wire fins. These condensers have a very open construction which 
allows dust to flow through easily and which reduces blockage of air flow if dust does collect on 
the condenser surfaces. Flat fin condensers used in refrigerators are known to require more 
careful attention to cleaning. Use of high fin densities is more accepted in air-conditioning 
applications because periodic maintenance is expected and because size would get enormous if 
aggressive fin spacing wasn’t employed, whereas cleaning of refrigerator condensers occurs 
infrequently or never, and the loads are small enough so that maximizing use of space is not 
critical. DOE has eliminated this option from consideration in subsequent analysis.

4.2.10 Fan Blade Improvements 
Refrigerator fan blades use an axial design. They are typically injection molded plastic 
with a three-dimensional shape for improved performance as compared with older stamped sheet 
metal designs. One source of inefficiency for axial fans lies in their tendency to throw air 
outward, necessitating a shroud to collect and redirect airflow along the axis as intended. The 
Pax Group™ has developed a fan (PAX fan) that employs streamlined blades with patented 
geometrical shapes derived from a naturalistic design approach, providing better airflow 
direction and improved efficiency. Tests performed when replacing existing motor combinations 
with A.O.Smith motors and PAX fan blades show power input reductions in the range of roughly 
10% to 35%.3 It is impossible to tell how much of this benefit is associated with the fan blade 
and how much with the motor. Also, because the PAX fan is proprietary, the widespread use of 
the design is highly uncertain. There is in general little data available to quantify the energy 
benefit possible with improvement in fan blade design in today’s refrigeration products. Fan 
performance is highly dependent on details of integration with the system: orifice geometry, 
tolerance of blade/orifice gap, match of system flow impedence to fan performance, etc. Hence, 
making credible estimates of energy savings potential through fan blade replacement requires 
testing fan blade swaps in baseline products. The cost of fabrication of improved fan blade 
geometries should be low, so most of the cost increase associated with this technology option 
would be associated with paying for the blade development and/or licensing fees. It is very 
difficult to predict what these costs would be unless specific vendors of high efficiency fan 
blades can be identified who provide complete information. During discussions with 
manufacturers, no information was provided which would allow credible calculation of savings 
and costs associated with improved fan blades. Hence, DOE has eliminated this option from
further consideration. 
4.2.11 Improved Expansion Valve 
Residential refrigeration products exclusively use capillary tubes for refrigerant flow 
metering. These tubes are inexpensive and they lend themselves easily to low-cost fabrication of 
suction line heat exchangers by brazing the capillary to the suction line. Automatic, adjustable 
thermostatic or electronic expansion valves are available, but they generally are oversized for 
residential refrigeration. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there is any potential for energy 
savings using alternative expansion devices. The DOE Energy test is conducted with a single set 
of standardized temperatures for the ambient air (90 °F) and for the compartments. A capillary 
tube can be designed to provide optimized performance for this set of temperatures. Systems are 
generally designed to operate with evaporator exit conditions having little or no superheat during 
energy testing, thus maximizing use of the evaporator. In the lower ambient temperature typical 
in homes, the pressure available to move refrigerant through the capillary tube is lower, thus 
possibly leading to increased superheat and less than optimum performance. An automatic valve 
could provide optimum performance for a wider range of operating conditions, but such 
improvement is not reflected in current energy testing. DOE has eliminated this option from
further consideration.

4.2.12 Off-Cycle Valve 
Off-cycle refrigerant migration reduces a refrigeration product’s efficiency by allowing 
warm and/or vapor-phase refrigerant to pass into the cabinet. A fluid control or solenoid valve 
installed after the condenser to effectively isolate the evaporator from the condenser during the 
off-cycle can be used to prevent refrigerant migration. Research has demonstrated that solenoid 
valves can yield substantial energy savings.4 Such a solenoid valve represents a possible 
reliability issue, although many wine storage products use similar solenoid valves to allow 
control of multiple compartments with a single compressor. Also, operation with an off-cycle 
valve requires that the compressor motor can start up against a substantial pressure difference. 
The starting windings of compressors that can do this reliably over the life of a refrigerator draw 
more power and hence reduce the compressor’s steady-state efficiency. The different efficiency 
levels of commercial refrigeration compressors designed for instant restart versus restart after 
pressure equalization have EER ratings which differ by 10% or more. Such a difference would 
be expected for residential compressors operating with an off cycle valve, and this difference 
would more than neutralize any benefit accrued from using the off-cycle valve. Hence, DOE has 
eliminated this option from further consideration.
4.2.13 Reduced Energy for Automatic Defrost 
In some cases, the defrost heat supplied is more than required. Thus, energy savings can 
be achieved by reducing the defrost heat by either using smaller heaters, reducing the heater on-
time, reducing the frequency of defrost, or a combination of these. In its 1995 TSD, DOE found 
that most manufacturers had already significantly reduced the electric heat for auto defrost in 
order to comply with the energy efficiency standards that became effective in 1993.5 The percent 
of energy represented by defrost for the refrigerator-freezers tested as part of this rulemaking 
ranged from 4% to 5% for products without adaptive defrost and from 1% to 5% for products 
with adaptive defrost. It is unlikely that significant energy savings are achievable by further 
reducing the energy for automatic defrost without compromising defrost performance, except 
through use of adaptive defrost. 
4.2.14 Condenser Hot Gas Defrost 
Another method of reducing the energy required for defrost is to eliminate the need for 
electric heaters by substituting condenser hot gas in their place. In a condenser hot gas defrost 
system, the compressor continues to run and a valve opens allowing hot compressed refrigerant 
to flow to the evaporator. Many frost-free refrigerator-freezers in the 1960s and 1970s used a 
condenser hot gas defrost system. In its 1995 TSD, DOE was not able to identify data that 
demonstrated that the condenser hot gas method was more cost-effective than adaptive defrost. 
Therefore, DOE dropped the condenser gas defrost as a technology option in favor of adaptive 
defrost. 6 Hot gas defrost would potentially save energy because a large portion of the heat for 
defrost could be provided by heat generated by the compressor motor during the on-cycle rather 
than from new electricity use. The compressor is at an elevated temperature with respect to 
ambient during the on-cycle and is certainly much warmer than freezing temperature. The heat 
would be transported to the evaporator with circulating refrigerant during the defrost cycle. 
However, in spite of this potential reduction in use of electricity to provide defrost heat, the 
4-7  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
energy savings potential is not well documented. Also, there are concerns regarding reliability of
the required valve. 
4.2.15 Electronic Temperature Control 
DOE has not identified any relevant information showing the energy benefit of electronic 
temperature control. Potential benefits of electronic control when operating with single-speed 
compressors are fine-tuning of the run times and fine-tuning of the cut-in and cut-out 
temperatures. While there may be potential for incremental improvement associated with such 
fine-tuning, the lack of data supporting claims for energy savings make it difficult to properly 
analyze this option. 
4.2.16 Air-Distribution Control 
Air temperature distribution in refrigeration products with fan-forced evaporator air flow 
is generally good, in contrast with some products with cold wall or roll bond evaporators. Hence, 
it is not clear that improvements in air distribution will provide significant reduction in energy 
use. Redirection of air flows in a cabinet could potentially provide a false indication of efficient 
operation, for instance if the coldest air from the evaporator discharge is directed at the locations 
used for the energy test thermocouples. It is conceivable that valid reduction in energy use could 
occur if the air flow distribution keeps cold air away from the walls of the cabinet. However, 
there is insufficient information regarding the designs of air flow distribution systems to quantify 
potential energy savings. 
4.2.17 Alternative Refrigerants 
R-600a (isobutane) is the most logical alternative to the HFC-134a refrigerant used 
exclusively in U.S. residential refrigeration products. Isobutane is a hydrocarbon refrigerant 
which has been used for many years in refrigeration products in Europe and other foreign 
countries. The theoretical efficiency of isobutane is higher than that of HFC-134a, however, the 
U.S. refrigeration industry has not adopted hydrocarbon refrigerants (likewise for the U.S. air 
conditioning industry) due to concerns regarding flammability. Recent shifts in this viewpoint 
are the result of pressures regarding the direct global warming impact of the refrigerant rather 
than the energy use impacts. Comments from manufacturers regarding the potential for 
efficiency improvement using isobutane are mixed. In any case, it is not expected that U.S. 
manufacturers will switch to isobutane to reduce energy use and that there will be limited 
conversion unless legislation is enacted which mandates phaseouts for global warming 
substances such as HFC refrigerants. In the case of such legislation, the potential improvement in 
energy use associated with isobutane will be balanced by a potential increase in energy use 
associated with reduced resistivity of PU foam insulation made with cyclopentane blowing 
agent, the most likely replacement for currently-used HFC blowing agents. DOE will consider 
the impacts of switch to hydrocarbon refrigerants and blowing agents if such legislation is 
enacted, but DOE will not consider use of isobutane as a design option to improve efficiency in 
the absence of such legislation.

4.2.18 Component Location 
Locating the compressor at the top of the refrigerator was noted as a potential technology 
option. However, this change would increase structural requirement for the refrigerator cabinet, 
increase risk of product tip-over, and provide much less practical use of space from the consumer 
perspective. It also makes design for re-evaporation of defrost water more challenging. It is 
unlikely that the savings would justify all of these drawbacks.
Another option is to locate the evaporator fan motor outside the cabinet to reduce internal 
loads from the heat loss of the motor. Evaporator fan motor input wattages are now in the range 
3W to 7W, with fan blade efficiency in the range 20% to 30% and motor efficiency in the range 
20% to 50%. Hence, load reduction, associated with moving the motor loss outside the cabinet, 
is only in the range 1W to 5W for the typically less than 50% of the time that the evaporator fan 
is in operation. The loss associated with the added infiltration and conduction is likely to be 
comparable to this level. Additional issues with this approach include reliability, reduced design 
flexibility, and the fact that reduction of motor losses (by using more efficient fan motors) may 
be a more effective approach to reducing the impact of the fan motor power input.  
No options for relocation of components have been identified which merit further 
consideration in the engineering analysis. 
4.2.19 Lorenz-Meutzner Cycle 
Research on Lorenz-Meutzner cycles reported in the literature involve binary mixtures 
HCFC-22/CFC-11, HCFC-22/HCFC-123, propane/n-pentane, and propane/n-butane. These 
systems achieved efficiency levels from 15 to 20 percent better than the baseline systems with 
which they were compared.7,8 Because the industry settled on the use of HFC-134a to replace 
CFC-12, interest in the Lorenz-Meutzner cycle as an alternative to conventional refrigeration 
cycles declined. All of the refrigerant combinations discussed above have specific problems, the 
first two with phaseout of constituent refrigerants CFC-11 and HCFC-22, and the last two with 
flammability of the hydrocarbon blends involved. While it is possible that HFC mixtures could 
be developed to create a viable Lorenz-Meutzner cycle refrigerator, DOE is not aware that such a 
prototype has been built and tested successfully. Hence, DOE has not considered this technology 
in the engineering analysis. 
4.2.20 Dual-Loop System 
Dual-loop systems have difficulty achieving their theoretical improvement potential due 
to the significantly reduced efficiency for smaller-capacity compressors. If the two compressors 
of a dual-loop system serving a refrigerator-freezer were sized appropriately for their respective 
loads, the freezer compressor capacity would nominally be roughly half that of a single-system
compressor. A fresh food compressor typically operates at a capacity significantly higher than its 
nominal capacity because of the higher evaporating temperature when cooling just the fresh food 
compartment. Hence, the nominal capacity of a fresh food compartment compressor serving a 
dual-loop system is generally 30 to 40 percent that of the single-system compressor. Even with 
the efficiency improvement associated with higher evaporating temperature operation of the 
fresh food compartment compressor, this compressor still would not operate at an efficiency 
4-9  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
level better than that of the single-system compressor for freezer conditions. Hence, with the 
efficiency characteristics of available compressors, it is not clear that the dual-loop architecture 
will provide any energy savings. Hence, DOE has not considered this technology in the 
engineering analysis. 
4.2.21 Two-Stage System 
In practice, a two-stage system would suffer the same disadvantages associated with a 
dual-loop system. Furthermore, it is not clear that a suitable compressor is available for the lower 
stage of such a system. DOE is not aware of any prototypes of such a system using compressors 
which their manufacturers would warrantee for such a product. Hence, DOE has not considered 
this technology in the engineering analysis. 
4.2.22 Control Valve System and Tandem System 
There are many patents covering dual-evaporator refrigerator designs. It is not clear how 
many of these were developed to improve system efficiency, since one of the benefits of using 
dual evaporators is avoiding excessively low humidity levels in the fresh food compartment. 
While there is research involving laboratory testing which shows that these technology options 
can save energy, DOE is not aware of any commercialized refrigerators using either of these 
approaches. In discussions with manufacturers none identified these options as being interesting 
approaches for energy use reduction. Further, due to the extensive patent literature discussing 
dual-evaporator systems, it is likely that products requiring dual evaporator designs would be 
restricted to the patentholders. Hence, DOE has not considered this technology in the 
engineering analysis. 
4.2.23 Ejector Refrigerator 
Energy savings have been reported for use of an ejector system in laboratory testing. In 
discussions with manufacturers there was limited familiarity with this concept and no
acknowledgement that it has been proven through prototype testing and/or that it is an interesting 
concept for improving efficiency. Hence, DOE has not considered this technology in the 
engineering analysis. 
4.2.24 Stirling Cycle 
In principle, the efficiency of Stirling cycles could be higher than for vapor 
compression systems, but there are various technical difficulties that have so far limited the use 
of Stirling-cycle cooling to small prototype domestic refrigerators. There is no circulating 
refrigerant fluid and the hot and cold end areas are very small, which creates heat exchange 
difficulties. Heat pipes may be required to transfer heat to and from the system. A comparison of
the performance of Stirling cycle with vapor compression compressors is shown  in Figure 4.2.1 
below. The Stirling cycle data was obtained from the Global Cooling website9 and from data 
presented at the Purdue Refrigeration Conference in 2002.10 The figure shows that Stirling 
technology is not currently ready to improve upon the efficiency of conventional technology. 
Hence, DOE has not considered this technology in the engineering analysis.

4.2.25 Thermoelectric 
 Thermoelectric cooling technologies currently do not achieve efficiency levels which 
make them attractive as a design option for improving residential refrigeration energy efficiency. 
As an example, DOE tested a thermoelectric refrigerator as part of the reverse engineering effort 
of this rulemaking. This refrigerator was a Haier model HRT02WNC, a 1.7 cuft all-refrigerator. 
In an 80 °F ambient with the system operating at full power, this unit was able to cool the 
interior to 47 °F while drawing 50W total. The fans serving the inside and outside heat sinks of 
the thermoelectric unit are rated at a voltage of 12 Volts and currents of 0.13 Amps and 0.16 
Amps respectively, and a control board power input of 1W is assumed. The thermal load for the 
cabinet was estimated as 12 W. Hence the thermoelectric module EER was 0.9 at a temperature 
lift of at most 33 °F, an order of magnitude less than is achieved by conventional technology. 
Hence, DOE has not considered this technology in the engineering analysis. 
4.2.26 Thermoacoustic 
While research suggests that thermoacoustic cooling systems could achieve respectable 
efficiencies, the technology has not reached a level of maturity sufficient for serious 
consideration as the basis for efficiency improvement in residential refrigeration products. 
Hence, DOE has not considered this technology in the engineering analysis.

4.3 REMAINING TECHNOLOGIES 
After eliminating those technologies that have no effect or do not increase EER and 
screening out those technologies that that do not meet the requirements of sections 4(a)(4) and 
5(b) of the Process Rule, DOE is considering the technologies in the following list. 
x Increased Insulation Thickness 
x Vacuum Insulation Panels (VIPs) 
x Variable Anti-sweat Heating 
x Improved Compressor Efficiency 
x Variable Speed Compressors 
x Increased heat exchanger area (extension of surface area or addition of coil rows). 
x Use of forced convection condenser (for upright freezers) 
x Improved efficiency fan motors (brushless DC) 
x Adaptive Defrost

CHAPTER 5.  ENGINEERING ANALYSIS 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
The engineering analysis establishes the relationship between manufacturer 
production cost and energy consumption for the refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and 
freezers covered in this rulemaking. The “cost-efficiency” relationship serves as the basis 
for cost-benefit calculations in terms of individual customers, manufacturers, and the 
Nation, from which the most economically-justified, technically feasible standard level is 
ultimately determined. 
The inputs into the engineering analysis include baseline characteristics for each 
product class addressed in the market and technology assessment (chapter 3), the design 
options from the screening analysis (chapter 4), as well as cost and energy use data 
collected from manufacturers, component vendors, reverse-engineering, and energy 
testing. The output of the engineering analysis is the cost-efficiency relationship for each 
product class independent of cabinet volume, which will be used in the life-cycle and 
payback period analyses (chapter 8). 
This chapter covers the product classes DOE analyzed, and the methodology used 
by DOE to develop manufacturing costs, energy consumption, and extend the analysis to 
low-volume product classes, as well as the results of these analyses.  
5.2 PRODUCT CLASSES ANALYZED 
In the engineering analysis for the preliminary notice of proposed rulemaking 
(Pre-NOPR), DOE analyzed the seven product classes listed in Table  5.2.1. DOE 
considers these classes to be representative of products currently shipped by the 
residential refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer industry based on total shipments. 
These product classes represent close to 90% of the shipments of refrigerators, 
refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. DOE did not directly analyze all covered product 
classes in order to carry out the analysis as efficiently as possible. DOE proposes 
extrapolation of energy standards to the remaining product classes as described in section 
2.15 of chapter 2.

5.3 METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW 
This section describes the analytical methodology DOE used in the engineering 
analysis. In this rulemaking, DOE has adopted a combined efficiency level, design option 
approach to developing cost-efficiency curves. DOE established efficiency levels defined 
on percent energy use lower than that of baseline efficiency products in order to allow 
comparison of information developed from different sources. However, DOE’s analysis 
is based on the efficiency improvements associated with groups of design options.  
Figure  5.3.1 presents the steps in the analysis and illustrates how they contribute 
to developing the cost-efficiency curves. The process begins with data collection and 
ends with the incremental cost curve results.  
As input to the analysis, DOE requested incremental cost-efficiency data from the 
industry. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) provided 
aggregated incremental cost data for a number of the product classes under analysis. This 
information was supplemented by analytically-derived cost-efficiency curves for the 
seven product classes listed in Table  5.2.1.  
To develop the analytically-derived cost-efficiency curves, DOE collected 
information from various sources on the manufacturing cost and energy use reduction 
characteristics of each of the design options. DOE reviewed product literature, conducted 
reverse-engineering of current products, and interviewed component vendors of 
compressors, fan motors, insulation, and heat exchangers. DOE also conducted 
interviews with manufacturers, using an engineering questionnaire which is reproduced 
in  appendix 5-A.

Figure  5.3.1 Flow Diagram of Engineering Analysis Methodology 
 Cost information from the vendor interviews and engineering questionnaires 
provided input to the manufacturing cost model. Incremental costs associated with 
specific design options were calculated using the cost model. Energy use reduction was 
modeled with a modified version of the established EPA Refrigerator Analysis (ERA) 
program which was used in the previous refrigerator rulemaking. The reverse 
engineering, vendor interviews, and manufacturer interviews provided input for the 
energy analysis. The incremental cost estimates and the energy modeling results together 
constitute the energy efficiency curves presented in this chapter. 
5.4 EFFICIENCY LEVELS 
5.4.1 Baseline Units based on the Current Test Procedure 
DOE selected baseline units as reference points for all of the product classes, 
against which DOE determined changes resulting from use of energy saving design 
options. The baseline unit in each product class represents the basic characteristics of 
equipment in that class. A baseline unit is a unit that just meets current required energy 
conservation standards and provides basic consumer utility.  
As discussed in chapter 3, DOE has initiated a rulemaking to revise the energy 
test procedure for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. Some of the 
anticipated changes to the test procedure such as changes in compartment temperatures 
will result in changes in the measured energy consumption. The test procedure change 
will also affect the measured size of the refrigerators, expressed as adjusted volume. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-4 
 
 
Since the maximum energy use for residential refrigeration products is expressed as a 
function of adjusted volume, the change in adjusted volume also affects the definition of 
baseline products. This section discusses definitions of baseline units for the engineering 
analysis based on the current test procedure, while the next section discusses modified 
definitions for baseline refrigeration products based on the expected revised test 
procedure. 
For this rulemaking, DOE established baseline efficiency levels as the current 
federal energy conservation standards, expressed as maximum annual energy 
consumption as a function of the product’s adjusted volume, as shown in Table 5.4.1. 
These definitions are based on testing according to the current energy test procedure.

5.4.2 Baseline Efficiency Definitions Based on the Expected Test Procedure  
As discussed in chapter 3, DOE expects to propose revisions in the energy test 
procedure to harmonize with expected test temperatures under consideration for IEC test 
procedure 62552 and to simplify calculation of refrigerated volumes. The expected test 
temperature changes are summarized in Table  5.4.2 below.

The temperature changes also impact the volume adjustment factor used to 
determine the adjusted volume. This factor is multiplied by the freezer compartment 
volume in the adjusted volume calculation. Current and expected volume adjustment 
factors are summarized in Table  5.4.3 below.

*A basic refrigerator is a single-door refrigerator with a freezer compartment with 
volume greater than 0.5 ft3.

The key changes in the volume measurement calculation between the current test 
procedure and the expected revised test procedure are summarized in Table 5.4.4 below. 
Adjusted volume will be impacted both by the change in the volume adjustment factor 
and the change in the volume measurement.

5.4.2.1 Data Illustrating the Impact of Test Procedure Changes 
The different compartment temperatures of the expected revised energy test procedure 
will change test energy use for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers. In addition, both 
the impact of the modified temperatures on the adjusted volume and the modified volume 
calculation method will change adjusted volumes. For these reasons, it is necessary to 
establish modified relationships between energy use and adjusted volume to define 
baseline products. AHAM provided data for a number of the product classes, presented in 
Table  5.4.5 through Table  5.4.7 below (this is referred to as the AHAM TP Change data).  
The AHAM TP Change data for product classes 11 and 13 both show energy use 
reductions, indicating that the products represented by these data are primarily all-
refrigerators. AHAM was not able to separately provide data for the all-refrigerators of 
these product classes, because insufficient data was provided by manufacturers for 
aggregation.

Additional data sources which provide indication of the impacts of the test 
temperature changes for standard-size refrigerator-freezers include (1) energy test 
measurements for the refrigerator-freezers tested as part of this rulemaking, and (2) 
calculation of the energy impacts using ERA, the energy modeling tool used for this 
rulemaking. The energy use impacts indicated by these sources are shown in Table 5.4.8.  
DOE conducted these energy tests and calculations for three products of each of the 
seven analyzed product classes (see Section  5.5.3.1 for discussion on selection of 
products for reverse engineering and energy testing).

†This product was thought to be product class 7 when purchased. 
The AHAM TP Change data shows reasonable agreement with the DOE modeled 
energy use impacts. However, the DOE energy measurements indicate a higher 
sensitivity to the temperature change of the new test procedure. The AHAM data shows 
that there can be significant variation in the sensitivity of different refrigerator-freezer 
products to the test temperature changes, particularly for product classes 3 and 7. The two 
compact refrigerators of Table 5.4.8 exhibit different responses to the compartment 
temperature change because the 1.7 ft3 refrigerator has a freezer compartment smaller 
than 0.5 ft3 and is tested as an all-refrigerator, while the 4.0 ft3 refrigerator has a freezer 
compartment just larger than 0.5 ft3, requiring that it be tested as a basic refrigerator.  
5.4.2.2 Establishment of Baseline Energy—Adjusted Volume Relationships 
Based on the New Test Procedure 
The available data to inform the establishment of baseline energy versus adjusted 
volume relationships based on the expected revised test procedure is discussed in Section 
 5.4.2.1. While this data does not address every product class, DOE proposes to use it as 
the basis for establishing the baseline relationships. The approach DOE used to develop 
these relationships for all the product classes is summarized in Table 5.4.9 below. Note 
that product classes 1, 3, 11, and 13 are split because, while the all-refrigerators have 
reduced energy use with the new test procedure, the products which include freezers have 
significantly higher energy use. This applies to product class 11, since many of these 
units have freezer compartments smaller than 0.5 ft3, which allows them to be classified 
and tested as all-refrigerators rather than basic refrigerators. The test procedure impact of 
this classification is that the refrigerator compartment temperature will be raised for all-
refrigerators, while it will be reduced for basic refrigerators under the proposed test 
procedure.

Note: For product classes 8, 10, 16, and 18, while the volume impact is assumed 
to be negligible, the adjusted volume increases according to the increase in the volume 
adjustment factor. 
The methodology for determining new baseline energy—adjusted volume curves 
given the data indicating the impacts on the energy use and adjusted volume for a given 
product class is as follows. The proposed energy use and the current energy use for a 
product are represented as being proportional using an Energy Standard Adjustment 
Factor (ESAF). 
CURTPNEWTP BECESAFBEC u      Equation  5.4.1 
Where: 
BECNEWTP = Baseline energy consumption using the new test procedure; 
BECCURTP = Baseline energy consumption using the current test procedure. 
The ESAF is considered to be a function only of product class. Dependence on 
adjusted volume or efficiency level cannot be determined based on the available data. 
Similarly, the adjusted volume for a product under the proposed test procedure is 
related to the adjusted volume under the current test procedure using a Volume 
Calculation Adjustment Factor (VCAF). 
CURTPNEWTP AVVCAFAV u       Equation  5.4.2 
 
Where: 
AVNEWTP = Adjusted Volume using the new test procedure; 
AVCURTP = Adjusted Volume using the current test procedure. 
The VCAF, like the ESAF, is considered to be a function only of product class. 
Baseline energy use for the current test procedure is expressed as follows, where the 
constants A and B are a function of product class. 
BAVABEC CURTPCURTP u      Equation  5.4.3 
 
Combining Equations 5.4.1 through 5.4.3 gives the following relationship for the 
baseline energy consumption based on the new test procedure.

5.4.2.3 Investigation of the Slope of the Energy Use Curve 
DOE carried out analysis to confirm whether the slopes of the baseline energy 
use—adjusted volume curves for the product classes analyzed in depth as part of the 
engineering analysis are representative of the energy use of typical products. DOE 
conducted these analyses based on the expected revised test procedure. The analysis 
started with an energy model of a minimally-compliant product and examined the trend 
in calculated energy use as the product size changes with constant insulation thickness. 
For the analysis of compact refrigerators, DOE considered the change in efficiency of 
typically available compressors sized appropriately for the product. For standard-size 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22

products the DOE used a constant compressor efficiency in the analysis, based on 
observation that compressor efficiency does not vary significantly in the capacity range 
suitable for most standard-size products (this is discussed in greater detail in section 
 5.8.3). The energy—adjusted volume slopes calculated in this analysis are presented in 
Table  5.4.11 below. The table also shows the slopes of the proposed baseline energy 
use—adjusted volume relationships of Table  5.4.10 above. The comparison provides an 
indication of whether adjustment might be required to the proposed baseline energy use 
relationships, which are based on the current energy conservation standards and the 
expected impacts of the expected revised test procedure. The comparison shows that 
consideration may need to be given to whether the slope for the baseline energy use 
relationships should be adjusted for product classes 5, 11, 11A, and 18. By extension, 
similar consideration should be given to the slopes for product classes 4 and 5A, which 
were not directly examined, but the trends for which should be predicted by the analyses 
for product classes 7 and 5, respectively. The question of whether adjustments should be 
made to the baseline energy use relationships of Table  5.4.10 is a topic on which DOE 
requests comment from stakeholders.

5.4.3 Incremental Efficiency Levels 
DOE established a series of incremental efficiency levels, for which it has 
developed incremental cost data and quantified the cost-efficiency relationship for each 
of the seven analyzed product classes. The incremental efficiency levels are shown in 
Table  5.4.12 below. Maximum available efficiency levels for the analyzed product 
classes, which are based on a survey of product databases and manufacturer websites, are 
tabulated in Table  5.4.13 below. Maximum technology levels, which are based on DOE 
energy modeling using all applicable design options, are discussed in Section 5.4.4.

5.4.4 Maximum Technology Level  
DOE defines a maximum technology level to represent the theoretical maximum 
possible efficiency if all available design options are incorporated. The maximum 
technology level is not to be confused with the maximum available level, which is the 
highest efficiency unit currently available on the market. In many cases the maximum 
technology level is not commercially available because it is not yet economically 
feasible. Figure  5.4.1 below shows the maximum available efficiency levels, based on the 
ENERGY STAR database of 4/9/09, with adjustments including deleting products which 
are no longer for sale based on the CEC database and manufacturers’ and retailers’ 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-17 
 
 
websites. For this chart, the all-refrigerator products of product classes 1, 3, 11, and 13 
were not included—some of these have higher efficiency levels than those shown in the 
chart. The maximum available efficiency product varies significantly among the product 
classes, from 1% for product class 13 to 51% for product class 2.  
As mentioned, the maximum technology level may not represent available 
products because they may not be economically feasible. DOE determined maximum 
technology levels using energy modeling. The energy models for the maximum 
technology levels were based on use of all design options applicable for the specific 
product classes. While these product configurations have not likely been tested as 
prototypes, all of the individual design options have been incorporated in available 
products. The maximum technology efficiency levels for the analyzed product classes are 
presented in Table 5.4.14 below. These efficiency levels are significantly higher than the 
maximum available products. The costs of the maximum technology efficiency level 
designs are also quite high, being based on extensive use of high-cost design options such 
as vacuum insulating panels as well as all applicable lower-cost design options.  Table 
5.4.14 indicates which design options were used for each of the product classes.

5.5 DATA COLLECTION 
DOE collected data from a number of sources to support the engineering analysis. 
The key sources include the following. 
x AHAM 
x Component Vendors 
x Reverse-Engineering of Products 
x Manufacturer Interviews 
x Energy Tests 
The data collection process is described in greater detail in the following sections. 
5.5.1 Manufacturer-Submitted Shipment and Cost Data from AHAM 
DOE included draft data requests sheets to support the engineering and other 
DOE analyses in the framework document as Tables A1 through A10 of that document. 
Some of these tables were revised based on comments received during the framework 
comment period. For example, incremental cost data was provided for up to 35% 
efficiency level, and included a 10% efficiency level, which replaced the 15% efficiency 
level of the draft tables. Other requests DOE made to AHAM in addition to the requests 
made in the framework document include the following. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-19 
 
 
x Historical shipment data for Wine Coolers, broken out by key types:  manual 
defrost/auto defrost. 
x Historical shipment data for Built-in Refrigerators, disaggregated by product class. 
x Recent shipment data for products incorporating a wine cooler compartment with 
either (1) a fresh food compartment, (2) a freezer compartment, or (3) both a fresh 
food and a freezer compartment. 
x Recent shipment data for French Door refrigerators broken out between products with 
and without TTD ice service. 
x Recent shipment data for convertible-bottom-drawer refrigerators (products with 
three doors configured as a side-by-side arrangement on top with a single drawer 
below, and for which the upper compartments are freezer and fresh food 
compartments and the drawer is convertible). 
x Percent of refrigerator-freezers shipped with ice makers for applicable product classes 
(3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15), historical data if possible. 
x Total shipments of ice makers (any breakdown by (a) installed at factory, (b) installed 
by dealer, (c) installed by homeowner?), historical data if possible. 
x For as many refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer models as practical, data on 
the impact of the proposed changes in compartment temperature and volume 
calculation method: 
o Compartment Volumes: volumes calculated according to the current 
procedure and according to the new procedure, with indication of product 
class. 
o Energy use (for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers only): Annual energy 
use measurements for units tested for both temperatures (i.e. not Energy Label 
data—this should be energy test values calculated based on test data for the 
old temperatures and the new temperatures for sequential tests of the same 
unit. This will typically require three tests to make sure that both sets of 
temperatures are bracketed.  
o It is anticipated that data for product classes 3 and 13 would be separated 
according to whether the product is a refrigerator-freezer or all-refrigerator. 
AHAM supported the rulemaking by supplying much of this data. AHAM 
supplied DOE with aggregated shipment-weighted average data for many of the 
submittals in order to avoid divulging data submitted by individual manufacturers. The 
AHAM incremental cost data included incremental material, labor, and overhead costs as 
well as conversion capital expenditures and one-time product conversion expenses for 
each efficiency level. These data are presented in Section  5.9.2, where they can more 
readily be compared with the results of DOE analysis. Data associated with other AHAM 
submittals are presented in the relevant chapters and sections most directly related to the 
data in question. 
5.5.2 Component Vendor Data 
DOE directly contacted major suppliers of key refrigerator and freezer 
components to obtain performance and cost data to support its design option analysis. 
The data received from vendors was compared with information received from 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22

manufacturers during the manufacturer interviews in order to develop input values for 
performance and cost parameters for the energy modeling and manufacturing cost 
modeling. This vendor solicitation effort consisted of phone interviews, email 
correspondence, and in-person interviews. Table  5.5.1 lists the vendors contacted. 
DOE also obtained from the compressor vendors or their websites complete 
performance data for compressors used in many of the energy analyses, including 
analyses for baseline and improved-efficiency configurations.

5.5.3 Reverse Engineering 
DOE purchased a number of representative refrigerators and freezers as part of 
the engineering analysis in order to examine design and fabrication details. This reverse-
engineering included detailed measurement of dimensions, system and component-level 
power measurements, measurement of air flows for products with forced convection heat 
exchangers, and physical teardowns. The results of the reverse engineering process were 
used as input to the manufacturing cost modeling and the energy use modeling. This 
section describes the selection of products for reverse-engineering as well as some of the 
measurements made to support subsequent modeling. Section  5.6 provides a more 
thorough description of the physical teardown process used to support manufacturing cost 
modeling.  
5.5.3.1 Selection of Products for Reverse Engineering 
DOE performed reverse engineering on units rated at baseline and improved (i.e., 
ENERGY STAR) energy consumption levels for the seven analyzed product classes. 
DOE chose at least one representative small-size and one large-size unit to cover the 
range of volumes within each product class. In order to best examine the design choices 
associated with efficiency improvements, DOE selected baseline efficiency/ENERGY

STAR product pairs if possible, for which the two products were identical other than the 
differences necessary for the ENERGY STAR-rated product to achieve higher efficiency. 
Such product pairs included the 21 ft3 Top-Mount refrigerator-freezers, the 26 ft3 Side-
Mount refrigerator-freezers, the 20 ft3 upright freezers, and the 4 ft3 compact refrigerators. 
Table  5.5.2 lists descriptions of the selected units and indicates whether energy testing 
was performed (see Section  5.5.5 for more on energy testing).

5.5.3.2 Collection of Energy Modeling Data  
DOE examined each unit prior to teardown to record details to be used as input 
for the energy modeling. The key measurements are described in this section. 
The rated refrigerated volumes for each product’s compartments and its rated 
energy use were based on product literature or the ENERGY GUIDE. In the case of the 
3.4 ft3 chest freezer, the product literature did not provide an indication of energy use, 
and the product did not arrive with an ENERGY GUIDE. For this product, DOE assumed 
that energy use was exactly equal to maximum allowable energy use for the product 
class.  
Power input for the product was measured for a period of 24 or more hours. This 
measurement was not intended to be an energy test, but provided useful information 
regarding the product controls, including off-cycle wattage, defrost heater on-time, and 
defrost interval (or indication of variable defrost). The power measurements for the 
products were made in the reverse engineering test laboratory, whose ambient 
temperature may have covered a broad range from 65 ˚F to 85 ˚F during the time that 
these measurements were carried out. Also, careful attention was not paid to the 
temperature setpoints for this measurement—the setpoints generally were left in the as-
shipped positions.  
Component-level power measurements were carried out for fans, defrost heaters, 
and manual defrost controls for the products which had these components. Power was 
also measured for some products’ anti-sweat heaters. 
Air flow measurements were made for all forced-convection heat exchangers. 
These measurements were made with a hot wire anemometer. The location of these 
measurements varied depending on the heat exchanger type and configuration. The 
determination of air flows based on these measurements is not very reliable, so this 
measurement was used as an indication of air flow trends more than exact indication of 
air flow for the various products. 
Details of the cabinet size and insulation thickness were based on direct physical 
measurements. Most of these measurements were made prior to the teardown, but 
measurements of some parameters, such as outer shell thickness, inner liner thickness, 
and insulation thickness, were made during the teardown process. Use of insulation other 
than polyurethane foam was noted as part of the teardown process. Frame area details 
including gasket details were observed, and recorded with pictures as part of the 
teardown process.  
Heat exchanger details were recorded, including type, configuration, numbers of 
tubes and fins, dimensions, etc. For cold wall and hot wall heat exchangers this data was 
recorded during the product teardown process. The details of anti-sweat heaters were also 
determined during the teardown process, including the layout for refrigerant anti-sweat 
loops. The details of suction line heat exchangers were similarly determined during 
teardown.

Component manufacturer and model data were recorded for key components such 
as compressors, fans, and controls.  
The energy modeling data for the teardown products are presented in detail in 
appendix 5-A.  
5.5.4 Manufacturer Interviews 
DOE’s contractor discussed engineering issues with manufacturers during the pre-
NOPR interviews. The engineering questions were consolidated into an engineering 
questionnaire, which guided the interview process for all of these discussions. The 
engineering questionnaire is shown in appendix 5-A. Key technical topics addressed 
during these discussions include the following: 
x Typical characteristics of components and typical design details (i.e. such as 
insulation thicknesses) used for key product classes. 
x Typical design differences between baseline and ENERGY STAR products. 
x Differences in design pathways and incremental costs across different product classes  
x Viability of technology options, and their typical costs. 
All of these interviews were conducted under non-disclosure agreements with the 
manufacturers. Hence, none of the individual responses can be reported. However, values 
for many of the parameters and costs used in the engineering analysis were based on 
aggregated input from these discussions. 
5.5.5 Energy testing 
DOE conducted energy testing to verify energy use of many of the products 
obtained for reverse engineering, to provide refrigeration system data to support energy 
use modeling, and to evaluate the difference in energy use between current energy test 
compartment temperatures and the new temperatures associated with the expected revised 
test procedure.  
Twelve of the 24 units were tested, as indicated in Table  5.5.2, including all of the 
refrigerator-freezer models and one each of the upright freezers, chest freezers, and 
compact refrigerators. No compact chest freezers were tested. 
Energy testing was carried out by an independent test lab according to the DOE 
Energy Test Procedure as described in 10 CFR Part 430 Subpart B, Appendix A1 or B1, 
with reference to AHAM Standard HRF-1-1979 as applicable. In addition to the standard 
energy test results, DOE requested specific temperature measurements to be taken in 
various locations during the test to better understand the refrigeration system operating 
characteristics. Specifically, low-mass thermocouples were mounted in good thermal 
contact with the surface of refrigerant tubing, insulated externally from local ambient air.  
Table 5.5.3 lists the additional measurements.

5.6 MANUFACTURING COST MODELING 
5.6.1 Generation of Bills of Materials 
The end result of each teardown is a structured bill of materials (BOM). DOE 
developed structured BOMs for each of the physical teardowns. Structured BOMs 
describe each product part and its relationship to the other parts in the estimated order in 
which manufacturers assembled them. The BOMs describe each fabrication and assembly 
operation in detail, including the type of equipment needed (e.g., presses, drills), the 
process cycle times, and the labor associated with each manufacturing step. The result is 
a thorough and explicit model of the production process, which includes space, conveyor, 
and equipment requirements by planned production level. 
The BOMs incorporate all materials, components, and fasteners classified as 
either raw materials or purchased parts and assemblies. The classifications into raw 
materials or purchased parts were based on DOE’s previous industry experience, recent 
information in trade publications, and discussions with high- and low-volume original 
equipment manufacturers (OEMs). DOE also visited manufacturing plants to reinforce its 
understanding of the industry’s current manufacturing practices for each of the three 
product categories.

For purchased parts, the purchase price is estimated based on volume-variable 
price quotations and detailed discussions with manufacturers and component suppliers. 
For fabricated parts, the prices of “raw” materials (e.g., tube, sheet metal) are estimated 
on the basis of 5-year averages (see Section  5.6.4.4). The cost of transforming the 
intermediate materials into finished parts is estimated based on current industry pricing. 
DOE shared major estimates with manufacturers during the engineering manufacturer 
interviews to gain feedback on the analysis, its methodology, and preliminary results. 
5.6.2 Cost Structure of the Spreadsheet Models 
The manufacturing cost assessment methodology used is a detailed, component-
focused technique for calculating the manufacturing cost of a product (direct materials, 
direct labor, and the overhead costs associated with production). The first step in the 
manufacturing cost assessment was the creation of a complete and structured BOM from 
the disassembly of the units selected for teardown. The units were dismantled, and each 
part was characterized according to weight, manufacturing processes used, dimensions, 
material, and quantity. The BOM incorporates all materials, components, and fasters with 
estimates of raw material costs and purchased part costs. Assumptions on the sourcing of 
parts and in-house fabrication were based on industry experience, information in trade 
publications, and discussions with manufacturers. Interview and plant visits were 
conducted with manufacturers to add industry experience on the methodology and 
pricing. 
The last step was to convert this information into dollar values. To perform this 
task, DOE collected information on labor rates, tooling costs, raw material prices, and 
other factors. DOE assumed values for these parameters using internal expertise and 
confidential information available to DOE contractors. Although most of the assumptions 
are manufacturer specific and cannot be revealed, Section  5.6.4.3 provides a discussion of 
the values used for each assumption. 
In summary, DOE assigned costs of labor, materials, and overhead to each part 
whether purchased or produced in-house. DOE then aggregated single-part costs into 
major assemblies (e.g., door assembly, heat exchanger assembly, shelving, packaging, 
controls, bottom components assembly, wiring harnesses, inner/outer wrapper assembly, 
etc.) and summarized these costs in a worksheet. During engineering interviews with 
manufacturers, DOE showed key estimates from the cost model and asked for feedback. 
DOE considered any information manufacturers gave that was relevant to the cost model 
and incorporated it into the analysis, if appropriate. 
5.6.3 Cost Model and Definitions 
Once DOE disassembled selected units, gathered information from manufacturer 
catalogs on additional products, and identified technologies, DOE created an appropriate 
manufacturing cost model that could translate physical information into manufacturer 
production costs (MPCs). The cost model is based on production activities and divides 
factory costs into the following categories: 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-26 
 
 
x Materials: Purchased parts (i.e. compressor, fan motors, control boards, door handles, 
shelf frames, etc.), raw materials (i.e., cold rolled steel, copper tube, etc.), and indirect 
materials that are used for processing and fabrication. 
x Labor: Fabrication, assembly, indirect, and supervisor labor. Fabrication and 
assembly labor cost are burdened with benefits and supervisory costs. 
x Overhead: Equipment, tooling, and building depreciation, as well as utilities, 
equipment and tooling maintenance, insurance, and property taxes. 
5.6.3.1 Cost Definitions 
Because there are many different accounting systems and methods to monitor 
costs, DOE defined the above terms as follows: 
x Direct material: Purchased parts (out-sourced) plus manufactured parts (made in-
house from raw materials). 
x Indirect material: Material used during manufacturing (e.g., welding rods, adhesives). 
x Fabrication labor: Labor associated with in-house piece manufacturing. 
x Assembly labor: Labor associated with final assembly. 
x Indirect labor: Labor costs that scaled with fabrication and assembly labor. This 
included the cost of technicians, manufacturing engineering support, stocking, etc. 
that were assigned on a span basis. 
x Equipment and plant depreciation: Money allocated to pay for initial equipment 
installation and replacement as the production equipment wears out. 
x Tooling depreciation: Cost for initial tooling (including nonrecurring engineering and 
debugging of the tools) and tooling replacement as it wears out. 
x Building depreciation: Money allocated to pay for the building space and the 
conveyors that feed and/or make up the assembly line. 
x Utilities: Electricity, gas, telephones, etc. 
x Maintenance: Annual money spent on maintaining tooling and equipment. 
x Insurance: Appropriated as a function of unit cost. 
x Property Tax: Appropriated as a function as unit cost. 
5.6.4 Cost Model Assumptions Overview 
As discussed in the previous section, assumptions about manufacturer practices 
and cost structure played an important role in estimating the final product cost. Some 
assumptions were different for specific manufacturers, depending on their market 
position, manufacturing practices, and size. 
In converting physical information about the product into cost information, DOE 
reconstructed manufacturing processes for each component using internal expertise and 
knowledge of the methods used by the industry. DOE used assumptions regarding the 
manufacturing process parameters (e.g., equipment use, labor rates, tooling depreciation, 
and cost of purchased raw materials) to determine the value of each component. DOE 
then summed the values of the components into assembly costs and, finally, the total 
product cost. The product cost included the material, labor, and overhead costs associated 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-27 
 
 
with the manufacturing facility. The material costs included both direct and indirect 
materials. The labor costs included fabrication, assembly, indirect, direct, and supervisor 
labor rates, including the associated overhead. 
The labor costs included assembly, fabrication, supervisor, and indirect labor. 
Overhead costs included equipment depreciation, tooling depreciation, building 
depreciation, utilities, equipment, tooling maintenance, insurance, property, and taxes. 
DOE used the information gathered from manufacturer interviews to make 
updates to the cost model. These changes involved updating component and material 
pricing. 
The next sections discuss specific assumptions about outsourcing, factory 
parameters, production volumes, and material prices. When the assumptions are 
manufacturer-specific, they are presented as industry averages to prevent disclosure of 
confidential information. 
5.6.4.1 Fabrication Estimates 
DOE characterized parts based on whether manufacturers purchased them from 
outside suppliers or fabricated them in-house. For purchased parts, DOE estimated the 
purchase price. For fabricated parts, DOE estimated the price of raw materials (e.g., tube, 
sheet metal) and the cost of transforming them into finished parts. Whenever possible, 
DOE obtained price quotes directly from the manufacturers’ suppliers. 
DOE based the manufacturing operations assumptions on internal expertise, 
interviews with manufacturers, and manufacturing facilities site visits. The major 
manufacturer processes identified and developed for the spreadsheet model are listed in 
Table  5.6.1. Fabrication process cycle times were estimated and entered into the BOM.

5.6.4.2 Production Volumes Assumptions 
A manufacturer’s production volumes vary depending on several factors, 
including market share, the type of product produced (i.e., standard- size refrigerator-
freezer, compact refrigerator-freezer, etc.), and if the manufacturer produces other similar 
products. DOE based production volume assumptions for these residential refrigeration 
products on shipment data, industry knowledge, and engineering manufacturer 
interviews. The manufacturing plant annual production capacities used for the analyses 
differ by product class as follows. 
x Product Classes 3 and 6: 1.5 million 
x Product Classes 5 and 5A: 0.5 million 
x Product Classes 4 and 7: 1 million 
x Product Class 9: 150,000 
x Product Class 10: 100,000 
x Product Class 11: 0.5 million 
x Product Class 18: 100,000 
5.6.4.3 Factory Parameters Assumptions 
DOE used information gathered from publicly available literature, manufacturer 
interviews, and analysis of common industry practices to formulate factory parameters 
for each type of manufacturer. DOE first made assumptions about a set of preliminary 
factory parameters before the manufacturer interviews. DOE then revised the 
assumptions using comments and information gathered during the interviews. Table  5.6.2 
lists DOE’s assumptions for refrigerator manufacturers.  
Table  5.6.2 Refrigerator & Freezer Factory Parameter Assumptions 
Parameter Assumption 
 
Plant Capacity (units/yr) see section  5.6.4.2 
Actual Annual Production Volume (units/yr) 5/6 of plant capacity 
Fabrication Labor Wages ($/hr) 16.00 
Fringe Benefits Ratio 50% 
5.6.4.4 Material Cost Assumptions 
DOE determined the cost of raw materials using publicly available information 
such as the American Metals Marketa, interviews with manufacturers, and direct 
discussions with material suppliers. Common metals used in the fabrication of residential 
refrigerator products include plain cold rolled steel (CRS), copper tubing, and aluminum. 
There have been large fluctuations in metal prices over the last few years. To account for 
these fluctuations, DOE used a 5-year average of metal prices from the Bureau of Labor

Statistics Producer Price Indices (PPIs) spanning 2003 to 2008 with an adjustment to 
2008$.b DOE used the PPIs for copper rolling, drawing, and extruding and steel mill 
products, and made the adjustments to 2008$ using the gross domestic product implicit 
price deflator.c Table  5.6.3 shows the 5-year average metal prices DOE used for the 
analysis.

Hot Rolled Steel $0.37 
Hot Rolled Steel Pipe $0.47 
Between 2003 and 2006, the price of steel rose over 60 percent and the price of 
copper rose over 140 percent. DOE used a 5-year average in material prices from 2003 to 
2008 to normalize these drastic increases to better represent long-term material price 
averages. 
For resins used in the fabrication of these refrigeration products, DOE used 
current resin prices gathered from industry research, publications such as Plastics News,d 
and interviews with manufacturers. Resin prices are determined by quantity and supplier 
(i.e., contract specific) and therefore have no true fixed market price. For this analysis, 
DOE used market resin prices current as of November 2008. The prices of resins have 
been constantly increasing and closely follow petroleum prices.  Table 5.6.4 shows the 
current resin prices used in the analysis.

5.6.5 Manufacturing Production Cost 
Once the cost estimate for each teardown unit was finalized, a detailed summary 
was prepared for relevant components, subassemblies, and processes. The BOM thus 
details all aspects of product costs. DOE totaled the cost of materials, labor, and direct 
overhead used to manufacture a product in order to calculate the manufacturing 
production cost.e Figure  5.6.1 shows the general breakdown of costs associated with 
manufacturing a product.

The full cost of product is broken down into two main costs, the full production 
cost or MPC, and the non-production cost. The non-production cost is equal to the 
manufacturer markup minus profits. 
Technologies used in the units subject to teardown are noted in the summary sheet 
of each cost model and are cost-estimated individually. Thus, various implementations of 
technologies can be accommodated, ranging from assemblies that are entirely purchased 
to units that are entirely from raw materials. Hybrid assemblies, consisting of purchased 
parts and parts made on site are thus also accommodated. 
5.6.6 Incremental Cost Estimates 
Incremental costs were determined for design options applied to the baseline-
efficiency refrigerator models. The approach for estimating the incremental costs varied 
depending on the design option. Details in this calculation which are specific to 
individual design options are discussed in Section  5.8, which discusses design options. 
Aspects of the incremental cost calculation which were generally applied to multiple 
design options are discussed in this section. 
Many of the design options involve replacement of a current component with a 
higher-efficiency component. For these design options, the increased price paid by the 
OEM for the new component represents the manufacturing cost increase—other elements 
of product cost such as overhead and capital expenditures would be insignificantly 
affected by these design changes. The appropriate price increases are discussed in Section 
 5.8 by design option. 
For some design changes, calculating the cost impact of the design change 
required direct use of the manufacturing cost model to determine changes to a number of 
parts. The baseline manufacturing cost was subtracted from the manufacturing cost of the 
modified design to determine the incremental cost of the design option. This approach 
was used in particular for insulation thickness increases and heat exchanger size increases 
for cold wall and hot wall heat exchangers. 
5.6.6.1 Overhead and Depreciation Costs 
Some design options involve costs in addition to the price increase associated 
with a new component. For such options, there may be overhead and capital expenses 
which must be added to the direct costs associated with the design option. Estimates of 
typical additional costs associated with overhead and depreciation for manufacture of 
refrigeration products were made for the reverse-engineering models, using estimates of 
these costs provided by the manufacturing cost model. These calculations were carried 
out based on proposed typical production plant capacities, with actual production 
volumes estimated to be 5/6 of plant capacities. The annual plant capacities for the 
product classes used in these calculations are as indicated in section  5.6.4.2. 
The additional costs are presented as percentage of direct material and labor costs 
in Table  5.6.5 below. The averages for the listed product class categories were used to

increase direct material and labor costs for some design options for which this adjustment 
was necessary.

trends. Census data shows that the average value of this cost adder for NAICS code 
335222 (Household Refrigerator and Home Freezer Manufacturing) is 27.7%.  
5.6.6.2 Depreciation Costs for Insulation Thickness Increases 
DOE considered that increases in cabinet wall and door thicknesses would require 
redesign of the entire refrigerator or freezer platform and lead to building of a new 
production plant. This conservative approach to the analysis was based on input from 
manufacturers. For such design changes, the difference in greenfield costsf of two designs 
would not capture the depreciation costs which would be incurred by the manufacturer 
and which would add to the product cost after such a platform conversion. DOE 
conservatively used the greenfield depreciation costs per product determined by the 
                                                 
f Greenfield costs are defined as the costs associated with building a new manufacturing facility, to be 
distinguished from the costs required to upgrade or modify a facility.

5.7 ENERGY MODELING 
DOE carried out detailed energy modeling of representative baseline and 
ENERGY STAR refrigeration products as one indication of the incremental costs 
required to achieve higher efficiency levels. The products selected for reverse 
engineering provided the basis for the energy modeling. Energy model input was 
determined for these products from the data collected during the reverse engineering 
work, described in Section  5.5.3. Additional data used both as input and for calibration of 
individual product energy models was provided by energy testing as described in Section 
 5.5.5. Energy modeling was also conducted for modified designs using groups of design 
options to improve efficiency to determine the expected energy savings associated with 
the design options. Using the energy modeling results and manufacturing cost modeling 
results for these designs allowed DOE to develop incremental cost estimates for multiple 
efficiency levels based on each of the baseline products analyzed. 
DOE carried out energy modeling during this rulemaking using an improved 
version of the EPA Refrigerator Analysis (ERA) program, earlier versions of which have 
been used in previous refrigerator rulemakings. Section  5.7.1 describes the ERA model 
development briefly. A more detailed description of the program and its recent 
development is presented in appendix 5-B.  
5.7.1 Energy Model development 
ERA is a steady-state energy model that calculates heat leakage into a cabinet and 
determines the energy needed by the refrigeration system to maintain the interior 
temperatures as specified by the user. Total energy used includes the energy from the 
compressor, fan motors, defrost heater, electronic control, and anti-sweat heaters, if 
applicable. See appendix 5-B for a detailed explanation of the ERA model.  
The DOS version of ERA was developed initially under EPA-sponsorship during the late 
1980s. This was undertaken by the EPA as part of its involvement in the establishment of 
energy standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers under the National 
Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA). A developmental version of the 
program was used by the DOE as a partial basis for the energy standard established in 
1989 (effective in 1993). The work also involved extensive testing of the model against 
manufacturer-supplied refrigeration appliance design and test data. Based on these 
comparisons and manufacturer review comments through its industry organization 
(AHAM), development of the model continued until its release in 1997.1  
 
ERA combined an analysis of the refrigeration load requirements of the cabinet with a 
simulation of the capacity and efficiency of the refrigeration cycle. The cabinet loads 
module was a modest enhancement of a program developed for the DOE during the late 
1970s,2 including the consideration of door-opening effects on the load and an ability to 
deal with complex insulation systems. The cycle module was a derivative of the NIST 
CYCLE 7 program,3 which used the CSD equation of state to represent the 
thermodynamic properties of pure and mixed refrigerants,4 adapting routines for 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-35 
 
 
calculating refrigerant properties from REFPROP3.5 The program, and its User’s Manual, 
were first released to the public in 1993, and for a few years were downloadable from the 
EPA website.6 Subsequent to the 1993 final rule, DOE published updated standards for 
refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers in 1997, becoming effective in 2001. 
Analysis carried out in support of the 1997 final rule involved use of the final released 
EPA version of ERA.1  
 
The DOS version of ERA was subsequently modified as described in appendix 5-B, but 
these revisions were not made available to the public. During the course of this 
rulemaking, further development of the model was carried out in order to allow use of the 
model for calculation of energy use of modern residential refrigeration products and to 
allow a modern version of the program to be made available to stakeholders to validate 
DOE analysis. Key modifications made include the following. 
x Enhancement of the user-interface to a Windows environment 
x Employment of the most current refrigerant property routines 
x Incorporation of a broad range of evaporator and condenser algorithms that 
correspond to the technologies now found in modern refrigerators 
x Improved compressor modeling, with built-in procedures for validating supplied 
compressor maps 
x Improvements where desirable in the cabinet loads analysis and cycle performance 
algorithms. 
x Preparation of internal documentation of the program through extensive context-
sensitive Help files. 
 
Many of the energy model calculations described in this chapter were made using a DOS 
version of the ERA program prior to the completion of the Windows version. 
 
The development history and capabilities of the program are described in more detail in 
appendix 5-B. 
 
5.7.2 Supplemental Spreadsheet Models  
Spreadsheet analysis tools were developed and used as part of some of the energy 
model development and calculations in order to (1) calculate airside heat transfer 
performance of spine fin evaporators, (2) determine appropriate composite insulated wall 
thermal resistivity when calculating cabinet thermal performance using vacuum panel 
insulation, and (3) adjusting ERA energy model output results for some product 
configurations for which ERA did not allow input of separate thermal resistivity for 
separate walls. 
Spine fin evaporator airside heat transfer performance was calculated using a 
spreadsheet. Equations for the model were based on the work of Holtzapple and 
Carranza.7,8 The ERA heat exchanger models (the ERAEVAP program) provided heat 
transfer coefficients for refrigerant-side heat transfer in the two-phase and superheated 
regimes. Using these values, the spreadsheet model provided the overall heat transfer 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-36 
 
 
coefficients for the two regimes of the evaporator and the effective heat transfer area, 
which were the inputs for DOS version of ERA. 
When modeling use of vacuum insulation panels (VIPs), the cabinet walls or door 
have two regions of differing thermal resistivity. Average values of resistitivity were 
calculated and entered into ERA to model these composite insulation systems.  
The ERA model structure did not allow separate specification of insulated wall resistivity 
for the compressor compartment—the program uses the bottom surface resistivity for this 
region of the cabinet. In some cases, separate spreadsheet calculations were conducted to 
adjust energy model results to account for the different resistivity that may be used in this 
region. For this calculation, used when application of VIP to the bottom surface was 
considered, the compressor compartment thermal load was increased proportional to the 
ratio in resistivities of the modeled surface and the composite surface including VIP. The 
compressor energy use was then increased in proportion to the reduction in overall 
thermal load. 
5.7.3 Development and Calibration of ERA Current Energy Test Models 
ERA modeling during the engineering analysis involved the following three 
phases.

This section focuses on the first phase of the ERA modeling work, namely 
establishing models for the teardown products based on the current energy test procedure. 
These models were later adjusted to represent baseline energy use under the new test 
procedures, and these models were used subsequently to calculate energy savings 
potential. The baseline analysis results were compared with available data to assure that 
the models provide accurate representation of product energy use. This section discusses 
the creation and calibration of the ERA energy models, the metrics which were 
compared, and the adjustments which were made in some cases in order to improve 
calibration.  
Input data for energy modeling was collected during the reverse engineering 
phase of the project. Collection of this data is discussed in Section  5.5.3.2 above. For 
products which DOE arranged to have energy tested, additional information was 
available for certain model parameters, such as defrost heater on times, compressor run 
time between defrosts, evaporator exit superheat, etc. Performance data was obtained 
from compressor vendors for the compressors used in the teardown products, as well as 
for compressors which could be considered as alternative options to reduce energy use.

Initial energy models were created, and the models were subsequently adjusted to 
provide a best match with available data for product performance. Key sources of 
information used for calibration of the energy models were the product EnergyGuide 
labels and data from energy tests carried out for a number of the reverse engineering units 
(Section  5.5.5). Energy test parameters besides energy use which were examined include 
compressor running power input, duty cycle, evaporating temperature, and condensing 
temperature. Since not all ERA input parameters can be determined definitively based on 
available information, some of the inputs were adjusted within reasonable ranges in order 
to provide good matches between model results and other performance indicators. It is 
recognized that energy levels reported in the EnergyGuide can be conservative to provide 
margin for variation in the production process. Hence, it is expected that ERA results 
would more likely be lower than the EnergyGuide value than higher. 
In some cases the directly modeled energy use was significantly lower than actual 
product energy use, In some of these cases in which the system operating parameters 
could be well calibrated based on test data, DOE attributed the high actual duty cycle and 
energy use to high actual cabinet thermal load. A number of factors could possibly 
explain such results, including greater impact than expected of thermal short circuits 
associated with wiring harnesses and other design details, excess gasket region load, and 
consistently lower insulation thermal performance than expected. A consistently 
underperforming compressor model could also explain such a discrepancy, but DOE 
concluded that this explanation is less likely than factors which would increase cabinet 
thermal load. Hence, for these cases, additional cabinet load was added to result in an 
energy use and compressor duty cycle which provided reasonable agreement with the 
available data. The side-mount refrigerator-freezers (product classes 4 and 7) were 
adjusted using this approach. 
In some cases, DOE concluded that ERA was not modeling particular heat 
exchangers properly. Adjustments were made in which the calculated effective surface 
area of the heat exchanger was adjusted upwards or downwards to represent heat transfer 
performance different than modeled. These adjustments were made to achieve more 
reasonable match of evaporating or condensing temperatures. Similar adjustments were 
made in some cases to evaporator pressure drop to adjust for an apparent discrepancy 
between measured evaporator surface temperature and compressor power input. 
The ERA analysis results after adjustments of the model input for the seven key product 
classes analyzed are compared with the EnergyGuide data and Energy test results in 
Figure  5.7.1 for refrigerator-freezers, in Figure  5.7.2 for standard-size freezers, and in 
Figure  5.7.3 for compact refrigerators and freezers. Energy testing was performed on a 
limited group of freezers and compact products: one upright freezer, one chest freezer, 
and one compact refrigerator. For these figures, the energy use of the freezers has been 
adjusted consistent with the energy test by applying the 0.85 correction factor for upright 
freezers and the 0.7 correction factor for chest freezers.  
 
The energy models are within a few percent of the EnergyGuide labeled energy use with 
one key exception, the 1.7 ft3 compact refrigerator. For this unit, the roughly 15%

discrepancy with the EnergyGuide energy use was not reconciled. Because the measured 
energy use also differed significantly from the rated energy use for this product, DOE 
could not draw firm conclusions regarding system operation in order to assist in the 
calibration effort. DOE expects that both the cabinet and system for this product are 
operating less efficiently than modeled.

5.7.4 Adjustments to Energy Models to Represent Baseline Products Tested Under 
the Proposed Test Procedure 
This section discusses adjustment of the calibrated baseline ERA models to 
address two issues: (1) modification of some of the modeled product designs so they 
represent baseline-efficiency products of the desired product classes, and (2) adjustment 
for the proposed test procedure changes. 
Modifications were made to some of the modeled product designs so that they 
represent baseline products of the product classes of interest with appropriate typical 
characteristics. The changes made are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
Some of the teardown products purchased were not available as baseline-
efficiency products, i.e. products with energy use that is minimally compliant with the 
current energy standards. This was true primarily for product class 5, refrigerator-freezers 
with automatic defrost and bottom-mounted freezers without TTD ice service. As 
indicated above in Table  5.5.2, one of these products had energy use roughly 15% below 
the maximum allowable energy use (the former ENERGY STAR level), and the others 
had energy use at 20% below (the current ENERGY STAR level). In order to allow the 
engineering analysis to examine the cost associated with the efficiency improvement 
from the 0% to the 15% and 20% efficiency levels, a baseline model was created for a 
product which would be minimally compliant with the standards. This was done by 
carrying out the engineering analysis in reverse, removing the less cost-effective design 
options first, in order to achieve calculated energy levels consistent with the baseline 
energy standard.  
For product class 5, baseline models were established to represent products with 
French Doors. Comments made at the framework meeting and submitted to DOE as part 
of the framework comment period addressed this issue, as discussed in chapter 2. Most of 
the teardown products were purchased prior to the framework meeting, so DOE was not 
able to consider this issue when selecting these products. The two French Door products 
(see Table  5.5.2) were purchased later, to allow investigation of the different design 
details for these products. However, these French Door products are not product class 5, 
since they have TTD ice service. During the manufacturer interviews, DOE learned that 
more than half the sales of product class 5 currently have French Doors. As a result, DOE 
has used a French Door design as the basis for the engineering analysis for this product 
class. Because neither the products initially purchased for teardown nor the French Door 
products purchased later strictly fit the intended baseline design configuration, 
adjustments were made to establish product class 5 French Door designs for the 
engineering analysis. This was done for the 25 ft3 product by developing and adjusting an 
energy model for one of the 25 ft3 product class 5A reverse engineering units and for the 
18.5 ft3 product by adding French Door design features to the initial baseline model for 
the 18.5 ft3 product class 5 reverse engineering unit. Development of the product class 5 
French Door models involved the following considerations and steps.  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-41 
 
 
French door refrigerator-freezers generally require electric anti-sweat heaters to 
prevent condensation of moisture on the gaskets and/or flip-mullions which seal between 
the French doors, since refrigerant-line anti-sweat heating is not possible in this region. 
The electric anti-sweat heater power input for the models was set at 6 W total, in spite of 
information that these heaters can have higher wattage input. The maximum time-
averaged heat input for a warm refrigerant liquid anti-sweat heater is typically somewhat 
lower per length,g suggesting that a wattage level of 6 W should be sufficient. DOE did 
not have adequate information regarding the thermal characteristics of the French Door 
gasket in order to allow a more refined estimate. DOE developed the baseline product 
design parameters assuming that the energy use is the average of tests with the anti-sweat 
heater on during one test and off during another.h 
Gasket load for the fresh food compartment was increased to account for the 
additional gasket region length. This was added to the single-door 18.5 ft3 product class 5 
model, but was already part of the baseline for the fresh food compartment doors of the 
25 ft3 product class 5A model. The freezer compartment of the 25 ft3 product class 5A 
teardown model had two drawers. Hence, the energy model representing this product as 
received incorporated an increase in the freezer compartment gasket load to account for 
the additional gasket length. When establishing the baseline ERA model for subsequent 
design option analysis, the added gasket load representing the two drawers was removed 
from the model. DOE took this step in order to establish a baseline model representing a 
single freezer drawer.  
The loads associated with the TTD ice system of the 25 ft3 product class 5A 
baseline were eliminated to create the 25 ft3 product class 5 with French Doors model. 
This includes the loads of the ice chute penetration, as well as the loads associated with 
the duct which conveys cold freezer air to the ice maker compartment. Additional loads 
and energy use associated with heaters in the region of this duct never entered into the 
model, because DOE understands that the teardown product was tested in a fashion which 
prevented activation of these heaters. 
Different compressor efficiency levels were selected and/or different fan motor 
types were selected in order to achieve modeled energy use consistent with the energy 
conservation standard. 
DOE obtained the product class 4 teardown unit (refrigerator-freezer with 
automatic defrost and side-mounted freezer without TTD ice service) with the 
understanding that it had TTD ice service. To address this discrepancy in the energy 
                                                 
g For example, if the liquid flow of an 800 Btu/h nominal capacity compressor is cooled from a condenser 
exit temperature of 110 ˚F down to an ambient temperature of 90 ˚F, the delivered heat load during 
compressor operation is 70 Btu/h. Assuming roughly 50% duty cycle and 13 ft of freezer perimeter (the 
typical location for warm liquid anti-sweat), the heat per linear foot is 10.8 Btu/h-ft, equivalent to 3.2 W/ft. 
h As discussed in Chapter 3, the DOE energy test procedure calls for calculation of refrigerator energy use 
based on a test with anti-sweat heater switch in the on position. However, DOE understands that many if 
not all manufacturers calculate energy use as the average of tests with the switch in the on position and the 
off position. DOE expects to propose changing the test procedure to allow averaging of the two tests in the 
ongoing test procedure rulemaking.

modeling work, the initial baseline model for the product was modified to represent 
product class 7 (refrigerator-freezer with automatic defrost and side-mounted freezer with 
TTD ice service). This was done by adding load and additional electric anti-sweat heat 
appropriate for the TTD feature. 
The engineering analysis has been carried out based on the expected revised 
energy test procedure, which includes modified cabinet temperatures as discussed in 
Section  5.4.2. After calibration of the ERA models with EnergyGuide and energy test 
data according to the current energy test procedure, and after the adjustment to the 
models to better represent the products under investigation as described above, the ERA 
models were adjusted to represent operation under the new energy test procedure. This 
adjustment did not apply to the freezers, since there are no proposed changes to the 
freezer compartment temperatures. The calculated impact of the compartment 
temperature changes on the energy use is discussed in Section  5.4.2.1 and is shown in 
Table 5.4.8 of that section. This calculated impact of the temperature changes is fairly 
consistent with the results provided by AHAM, although it is less than the impact 
measured during DOE testing of the teardown products. 
5.8 DESIGN OPTIONS 
After conducting the screening analysis described in chapter 4, DOE considered 
the remaining technologies in the design option analysis.  Table 5.8.1 lists the design 
options considered for each product classes. Some design options are only applicable to 
certain types of equipment. Following the table is a description of how each of the design 
options was applied during the engineering analysis. See chapter 3 for background 
descriptions of the technologies.

5.8.1 Increased Insulation Thickness 
Manufacturers stated during discussions that the potential for insulation thickness 
increases is very limited for many product classes. Greater insulation thickness would 
result in either decreased interior volumes, increased exterior dimensions, or some 
combination of both. They cited the high percentage of the market associated with 
replacements and the fixed sizes available for replacement refrigerators in consumers’ 
kitchens. The 1995 TSD supporting the 1997 refrigerator energy conservation standard 
final rule provided information regarding the reduction in served market associated with 
exterior size increases.9 Reduction in internal volume is undesirable because this is a key 
selling feature. As a result, DOE did not consider insulation thickness increase in the 
analysis for standard-size refrigerator-freezers. 
There is some more flexibility in the potential to increase insulation thickness for 
freezers, since freezers are less likely to be placed in fixed-dimension spaces in kitchens. 
DOE did consider insulation thickness increase of up to 1 inch for standard-size freezers. 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-44 
 
 
Compact refrigerators often have limitations on potential for size increase. 
However, many compact refrigerator products currently have insulation thickness no 
more than an inch. The potential energy benefit of insulation thickness increases for these 
products is significant. Hence, DOE considered increases of up to 3/4 inch for these 
products. DOE considered increase up to ¾ inch also for compact freezers. 
While a manufacturer’s approach to implementing insulation thickness increase 
would likely involve a combination of reduced internal volume and increased external 
dimensions, DOE used just external dimension increase. This was done to assure that the 
product size (represented by adjusted volume) and the associated baseline energy use for 
the product did not change as the design options were applied.  
Costs associated with insulation thickness increases were calculated using the 
manufacturing cost model. As discussed in Section  5.6.6, DOE applied a conservative 
treatment of depreciation costs in which additional cost equal to the greenfield 
depreciation cost per product was added in order to reflect the likely build of a new 
production facility. DOE assumed that the depreciation cost would be incurred for any 
increase in insulation thickness. However, DOE allowed for increases in the door 
thickness without applying depreciation costs associated with the cabinet, and vice versa. 
Initial manufacturing cost model calculations provided the total cost impact of 
increasing all of the insulation in the product by a single amount. In order to allocate the 
cost increase to the cabinet and the door, DOE assumed that the cost of increasing the 
insulation thickness of the door was 5% of the total. This allocation was applied to both 
direct costs and depreciation costs. 
5.8.2 Vacuum-Insulated Panels 
Vacuum-insulated panels (VIPs) increase efficiency by significantly increasing 
the thermal resistivity of the cabinet walls, and therefore decreasing heat penetration into 
the cabinet. DOE considered the addition of ½-inch thick VIPs to the walls and doors of 
the cabinet for all product classes, and the remainder of the insulation thickness was filled 
with PU foam. Data for VIP thermal characteristics and costs were provided by va-Q-tec, 
a VIP manufacturer. The cost information was confirmed through discussions with 
manufacturers. In these discussions, manufacturers pointed out that edge effects can 
result in actual performance significantly less than predicted. However, DOE considers 
that thermal performance estimates based on the va-Q-tec technology are more accurate 
than for other VIP options because this technology has a more modest mid-panel thermal 
resistance and a significantly thinner metallic layer than other options. The mid-panel 
conductivity of this VIP technology is 3.5 mW/m-C (0.024 Btu-in/sqft-hr-˚F).10 In 
contrast, the conductivity of PU foam is in the range 0.13 to 0.14 Btu-in/sqft-hr-˚F.  
As discussed in Section  5.7.2, thermal performance of composite walls including 
VIPs was done using composite wall average thermal resistivities. The composite wall 
resistivity Rw was calculated as follows.

Where RVIP and RPU are the thermal resistivities of the VIP and the PU foam, and 
tVIP and tPU are the thicknesses of the VIP and PU foam layers. The thermal resistivities 
for the materials are the inverses of the conductivities. 
DOE analysis of cabinet load reduction achievable through the use of VIPs using 
this analysis approach is consistent with analysis carried out by va-Q-tec and also 
consistent with prototype testing using VIP technology. The reduction in cabinet load 
possible using VIPs for a refrigerator-freezer with typical wall thickness is roughly 30%, 
which is consistent with results reported by Electrolux for use of vacuum insulation in 
freezers.11 
The following cost information, which va-Q-tec provided and/or which DOE 
developed based on subsequent discussions, formed the basis of the applied costs for 
VIPs. 
x Average panel cost $3.08/ft2 at 1.2 cm thickness. 
x Fill cost as a percent of panel cost 60%. 
x Added glue cost for adhering the panel to cabinet surfaces 5% of panel cost. 
x Cost savings associated with displaced PU foam 2.5% of panel cost. 
In order to allow calculation of costs for other VIP thicknesses, the fill cost is 
considered proportional to the thickness, while the remaining cost per square foot is 
constant. In addition, direct labor cost associated with application of the panel to cabinet 
and door surfaces was calculated based on the $24/hr wage rate (including fringe 
benefits) discussed in section  5.6, and time for application of 10 minutes for a 
compartment and 1 minute for a door. The direct material and labor costs associated with 
use of the VIP must be adjusted to account for capital expenses and overhead associated 
with incorporation of VIPs into the production process. Because the material cost of VIPs 
is currently high in relation to the costs of other materials used in the manufacture of 
refrigerators and freezers, the cost adders for overhead and depreciation discussed in 
Section  5.6.6.1 and shown in Table  5.6.5 were divided by two in order to provide more 
reasonable representation of these costs for this technology. Hence, DOE used the 
following percent additions: 11.7% for standard-size refrigerator-freezers, 14.2% for 
standard-size freezers, and 19.6% for compact refrigerators. 
5.8.3 Improved Compressor Efficiency 
DOE considered the substitution of higher efficiency compressors for all product 
classes. This design option was often applied in two stages if there was a large gap 
between the baseline energy efficiency ratio (EER) and the maximum available EER for 
a given compressor capacity. DOE acquired compressor performance data from 
compressor vendors for use in the energy analysis, including capacity and power input for 
the applicable range of combinations of suction and discharge pressure conditions. As an 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22

example of the potential for improvement, standard-size baseline refrigerator-freezers 
typically use compressors with a rated EER of 5.0 to 5.5 Btu/h-W. DOE considered 
improved EERs of 5.75 through 6.25 Btu/h-W.  
Currently the highest EER compressor commercially available is rated near 6.25 
Btu/h-W for standard- size refrigerator-freezers. The range of available compressor 
efficiencies is illustrated in Figure  5.8.1 below. The peak available efficiency level does 
not vary significantly for the range of capacities typical for standard-size refrigerator-
freezers (600 to 800 Btu/h). However, efficiency level drops off considerably for smaller 
capacity compressors that are generally used in compact refrigerators and freezers.

Estimates for increased cost of higher-efficiency compressors used for standard-

vendors. These estimates were also discussed with manufacturers. Based on this 
information, DOE developed a curve for the cost premium associated with higher 
efficiency compressors. This curve is shown in Figure  5.8.2 below.

Figure  5.8.2 Incremental Cost for Single-Speed Compressors for Standard-Size 
Products 
 
When considering compressor efficiency improvement for standard-size products, 
DOE used the performance data of specific higher-efficiency compressors in the energy 
analysis. The alternative compressors were selected to have nearly the same capacity as 
the baseline compressors, in order to assure nearly identical performance except for 
compressor power input. 
 
In the analysis of compressor efficiency improvements for compact products, an 
approach was required which addressed the reduction of compressor efficiency as the 
capacity is reduced. A curve roughly representing the maximum available EER for 
smaller compressors was developed. This curve is compared in Figure 5.8.3 below with 
the data for commercially available compressors.

Figure  5.8.3 Efficiency Curve for Low Capacity Compressors 
 
To model energy use of higher efficiency low-capacity compressors, DOE 
reduced the power input data for the baseline compressor by a selected factor so that the 
rated EER matches the maximum EER of the above curve. The baseline compressors of 
the products analyzed had EERs typically 0.5 to 1 Btu/h-W lower than the maximum 
curve shown in the figure above. 
 
DOE received vendor cost estimates for efficiency improvements for low-
capacity compressors. DOE also received information on the typical cost increase during 
discussions with manufacturers of products which use these compressors. A 
representative cost estimate of $10 per 1.0 Btu/h-W efficiency improvement was used in 
the analysis. 
5.8.4 Variable-Speed Compressor 
Variable speed compressors (VSC) operate at multiple speeds to allow variation 
of compressor capacity. They also generally use permanent magnet motors, which can be 
more efficient than induction motors for the power level required for residential 
refrigerator compressors. They improve efficiency by (1) use of the higher-efficiency 
motor technology, (2) increasing the operating effectiveness of heat exchangers because 
there is lower mass flow being cooled or warmed by a fixed-size heat exchanger, and (3) 
reducing cycling losses by reducing the number of cycles. VSC technology has been 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-49 
 
 
available for many years and a number of refrigerator-freezer products currently use the 
technology. Currently nearly all of these products use Embraco VSCs. DOE obtained 
compressor performance data for the range of sizes of Embraco VSCs. This information 
was used in the energy analysis. DOE selected VSC capacities to nearly match those of 
the replaced single speed compressors at 3000 rpm. The lowest available speed for the 
Embraco VSCs is 1,600 rpm. The compressor typically cycles at the low speed to 
maintain internal setpoints for energy test conditions. DOE primarily used the 
performance data for 1,600 rpm in the energy analyses. The performance of VSC 
compressors at the lowest speed and at 3,000 rpm is shown in Figure  5.8.1 above. 
In order to maximize the energy benefit of VSCs, a design typically needs to 
address the impact that longer run time at lower capacity has on fan energy use. The 
increase in fan energy use can negate much of the reduction in compressor energy use. As 
a result, it is typically necessary to use brushless DC fan motors. In addition, the speed of 
brushless DC fan motors can be varied, depending on the design configuration. DOE is 
not aware of brushless DC fan motors designed for 120 VAC power input which allow 
adjustment of fan speed, although such a design should be viable. Most designs 
incorporating fan speed control use DC-input power for the fans and require a control 
system which can provide the DC power and vary it to adjust fan speed. Not all of DOE’s 
analysis involved optimization of fan speed and power with the variable speed 
compressor system. Some of the analyses involved selection of 50% fan speed, and some 
of the anlyses involved selection of speed to achieve roughly 50% power input. The cube 
law for fan power was used to calculate power input, except that at the 1/8 power level 
associated with the 50% fan speed, this power level was doubled. 
Cost estimates for the switch to variable speed compressors were provided by 
Embraco, and cost estimates were also obtained during discussions with manufacturers. 
An average of cost estimates provided by the manufacturers weighted by manufacturer 
market share is very near $50, not including additional changes which might be required 
to implement a variable speed system. DOE used a $50 cost increase in the analyses. 
Additional costs associated with conversion of a refrigeration system to variable speed 
operation are associated with a switch to brushless DC fan motors and the use of a control 
system sophisticated enough to provide adequate or optimized control. The Embraco 
VSC design includes a control system which can be used with a conventional mechanical 
thermostat. This system has been implemented in a commercially available freezer.12 The 
Embraco control adjusts speed based on the response of the mechanical thermostat. DOE 
considers that this approach is suitable for products with manual defrost. For products 
with automatic defrost and especially adaptive defrost, it is not reasonable to expect that 
that the Embraco system alone would be suitable. DOE included in cost estimates an 
additional $25 for addition of an electronic control system for products with automatic 
defrost. For product classes for which a significant portion of current models already 
have electronic control (product classes 5 and 7), analysis was conducted for an 
electronic control unit and a mechanical control unit. The average results for these 
product classes were weighted averages based on the distribution of electronic control for 
the product class. The current electronic percentages were selected based on input from 
manufacturers as 50% for side-mounts and 75% for bottom-mounts. The additional cost

associated with conversion to brushless DC fan motors did not generally apply: because 
brushless DC fan motors are more cost effective than a full conversion to variable speed, 
the cost of the motors would have already been applied at a lower efficiency levelwhen a 
change to variable speed is considered. 
5.8.5 Increased Evaporator Surface Area 
The evaporator is necessary for transferring heat from the cabinet to the 
refrigerant. Larger surface area allows the heat transfer to occur more efficiently. DOE 
considered an increase in evaporator surface area for all products analyzed. In some cases 
the size increase was limited by available space. This was true especially for the chest 
freezers and compact refrigerators. DOE considered size increases of up to 20%, except 
for one of the upright freezer models, for which DOE considered an increase of up to 
50%. The size increases were implemented in the energy analysis through increase of the 
effective heat exchanger surface areas and refrigerant pressure drops entered into the 
ERA model. The pressure drop increases as well as the surface area because the 
refrigerant tube length would be increased to maintain fin efficiency.  
Treatment of the cost of the evaporator size increase depended on the evaporator 
type. For forced convention and roll bond evaporators, the baseline costs of the 
evaporators were adjusted upwards by the size increase factor. For cold wall evaporators, 
the cost increase was directly calculated in the manufacturing cost model by increase of 
the tube lengths and materials associated with providing good tube/liner thermal contact. 
5.8.6 Increased Condenser Surface Area 
The condenser transfers heat from the refrigerant to the ambient air. Larger 
surface area allows the heat transfer to occur more efficiently. DOE considered an 
increase in condenser surface area for all products analyzed. In some cases the size 
increase was limited by available space. This was true especially for hot wall or static 
condensers. DOE considered size increases of up to 20%. The size increases were 
implemented in the energy analysis through increase of the effective heat exchanger 
surface areas and refrigerant pressure drops entered into the ERA model. The pressure 
drop increases as well as the surface area because the refrigerant tube length would be 
increased to maintain fin efficiency.  
Treatment of the cost of the condenser size increase depended on the condenser 
type. For forced convention and static condensers, the baseline costs of the condensers 
were adjusted upwards by the size increase factor. For hot wall condensers, the cost 
increase was directly calculated in the manufacturing cost model by increase of the tube 
lengths and materials associated with providing good tube/shell thermal contact. 
5.8.7 Brushless DC Fan Motors 
Brushless DC fan motors are more efficient than the shaded pole motors which 
are often used in baseline model refrigerators.  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-51 
 
 
In the TSD supporting the 1997 refrigerator energy conservation standard final 
rule, shaded pole fan motor power input ranging from 8 to 12 W was assumed to be 
reduced to 4.5 W when switching to brushless DC motors.9 This is a reduction in power 
ranging from 44 to 57%. The cost increase of that analysis associated with the switch was 
$6.50 for an evaporator fan and $4.50 for a condenser fan. 
The fan power input measured for the teardown products are summarized in Table 
 5.8.2 below. For the baseline/ENERGY STAR product pairs, power input is provided for 
both sets of each applicable fan. The fan motor power reduction associated with the 
switch to brushless DC motors based on this data is in the range 60% to 65%.

*DC-input fan. The listed wattage is nominal. 
**Data provided for a baseline/ENERGY STAR product pair. 
DOE also obtained information on typical fan motor power reduction associated 
with a switch to brushless DC motors during discussions with manufacturers. The 
responses indicated that the reductions would be more modest than suggested by the 1995 
TSD values or the measurements of teardown products. DOE selected a compromise 
power reduction of 50% when the possible reduction was not already clearly illustrated 
by the measurements of the baseline/ENERGY STAR teardown product pairs under 
analysis. 
Incremental cost estimates for the switch to brushless DC motor were obtained 
through discussion with Matsushita, a key vendor supplying these motors, and through 
discussions with manufacturers. DOE used incremental cost estimates of $3.75 for 
condenser fans and $3.50 for evaporator fans. 
5.8.8 Adaptive Defrost 
An adaptive defrost system adjusts the time interval between defrosts based on 
some indication of the need for defrost. A common indicator is the length of time 
required to complete the previous defrost. Other indicators could include the number of 
door openings or a measurement of ambient humidity. DOE considered this design option 
for product classes which have automatic defrost (product classes 3, 5, 7, and 9). The 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-52 
 
 
ERA model allows input of compressor run time between defrost. To model this option, 
DOE increased the compressor run time between defrosts to 38 hours, as compared to the 
typical range for baseline products of 10-15 hours. The 38 hours is the default time 
interval allowed by the test procedure if the mean time between defrost test is not carried 
out, assuming default values of the minimum and maximum compressor run intervals of 
12 and 84 hours. 
Based on discussions with manufacturers, DOE used an incremental cost of $8 in 
the energy analysis for adaptive defrost. This cost assumes use of a standalone adaptive 
defrost controller, which could be used if the refrigerator does not already have electronic 
control. Refrigerators which have electronic control can implement adaptive defrost with 
programming changes which incur no per-unit cost. For some products for which a 
significant portion of current shipments already have electronic control, the incremental 
cost for adaptive defrost was multiplied by the fraction of products of the product class 
which do not already have electronic control, as was done for the electronic control cost 
addition for variable speed compressors. 
In cases where both adaptive defrost and variable speed compressor design 
options were analyzed, the cost of the adaptive defrost was eliminated, because the 
introduction of electronic controls would make use of a standalone adaptive defrost 
controller unnecessary. 
5.8.9 Variable Anti-Sweat Heater Control 
Variable anti-sweat heater control adjusts the time-average wattage of an electric 
anti-sweat heater based on ambient temperature and humidity conditions so that all 
surfaces are just above the ambient dew point. DOE considered this option for bottom-
mount French-door refrigerator-freezers (PC 5). These products must use electric anti-
sweat heaters in the region of the seal between the two fresh food doors to control 
condensation, because warm liquid anti-sweat heating cannot be applied in this region. 
Most modern refrigeration products use warm liquid anti-sweat heating, thus making 
electric anti-sweat heaters unnecessary, except in such locations. To model the energy use 
reduction associated with this design option, DOE established a curve representing the 
heater power input as a function of ambient humidity. DOE then calculated annual 
average electric anti-sweat heater wattage based on the frequency distribution of 
humidity levels established in the GE waiver describing a test procedure for this control 
scheme.13 The selected DOE curve is based on power levels of 0W at 65% RH and 9W at 
100% RH. The maximum power was increased as compared with the 6W used for the 
anti-sweat heater for the baseline product analysis (see the discussion in Section  5.7.4), 
because the variable anti-sweat heater control minimizes the energy use impact of the 
higher wattage. 
Implementation of variable anti-sweat heater control requires use of a humidity 
sensor and an electronic controller which can adjust the time-average heater wattage 
appropriately. For products which already have electronic control, DOE used the cost just 
of a humidity sensor. DOE used a cost of $9.48 for a Honeywell humidity sensor based 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-53 
 
 
on high-quantity pricing.14 No product currently exists which provides standalone 
variable anti-sweat heater control. However, DOE considers the $8 example of the 
standalone adaptive defrost controller to be representative of the incremental cost of such 
a product.  
5.8.10 Forced Convection Condenser 
A forced convection condenser can be more efficient than a hot wall condenser, 
because it enables more effective heat transfer from the refrigerant to the ambient air. 
DOE considered this option for upright freezers only (product class 9). This conversion 
involves the addition of a typical wire-tube condenser, a fan assembly, wiring to power 
the fan, and a warm liquid anti-sweat heating loop, and the elimination of hot wall tubing 
on the insulation side of the outer shell. In the case of the upright freezer products 
examined for the reverse engineering work, there was ample space underneath the cabinet 
for the condenser and fan assembly. In addition, these products incorporated hot gas 
condensate pan heaters. These heaters could be eliminated in a forced-convection 
arrangement, because the condenser heat and air flow of the forced convection 
arrangement would be sufficient to evaporate the condensate, as is generally done for 
refrigerator-freezers. DOE used a net incremental cost of $3 for this conversion—most of 
the cost of the added components would be saved through elimination of the hot wall 
condenser. DOE analyzed this design option both with shaded pole and brushless DC 
condenser fans. The option provided an energy benefit in combined design option 
analysis only when using the brushless DC fan motor.  
5.9 ENGINEERING ANALYSIS RESULTS 
This section shows the incremental cost curves developed by DOE and provides 
comparison to the data provided by AHAM. 
5.9.1 DOE Cost-Efficiency Curves  
DOE generated cost-efficiency curves for two product volumes in each of the 
seven analyzed product classes based on combinations of individual design options. The 
curves were normalized by converting to costs at specific efficiency levels (every 5% 
energy use reduction from 10% to 45%) for simplified downstream analysis.  
Conversion of cost curves to the specified efficiency levels was complicated by 
the characteristics of the design options required to provide further efficiency 
improvement. Some design options can be partially applied, while others cannot. For 
instance, for the 21 ft3 top-mount refrigerator, the second step in the design option path 
raises the efficiency level from 9.9% to 16.8% by increasing the compressor EER from 
5.54 to 6.08 Btu/h-W. The cost for compressor efficiency improvement, illustrated in 
Figure  5.8.2, varies as the efficiency varies. Because intermediate efficiency level 
compressors are generally available, the cost to achieve a fraction of the increase to 
16.8% would be a fraction of the cost to achieve the full step to 16.8%. Hence, DOE 
calculated the cost of raising efficiency to the 10% and 15% levels by calculating the 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
5-54 
 
 
lower cost of partial improvement in compressor EER. In some cases, such as 
implementation of a variable speed compressor, the design option cannot be partially 
implemented. For these cases, the entire cost of the design option was applied at the 
intermediate efficiency level, even though the design might overshoot the efficiency 
level. This causes some of the incremental cost curves to have slopes which don’t 
increase monotonically. 
The DOE incremental MSP costs are presented in Table  5.9.1 below. While DOE 
analyzed two sizes of each product, it is not clear that differences in the curves can 
rightly be attributed to the size differences. Other factors likely have greater influence, 
for instance for product class 3 the 16 ft3 product had noticeably thinner insulation than 
the 21 ft3 product. DOE considers the averages of the MSPs to be representative for each 
product class. The separate analysis of the slopes of the energy use vs. adjusted volume 
curves discussed in section  5.4.2.3 addresses the issue of adjustments to more accurately 
reflect the impact that product size has on energy use.

indication of the variation of the costs, the full range is very likely much greater. There is 
insufficient information currently available for DOE to confidently calculate cost 
distributions at each efficiency level. The average curves for incremental manufacturer

5.9.2 AHAM Incremental Cost Data 
This section presents the aggregated incremental cost data provided by AHAM 
and discusses differences between this data and the incremental cost information 
developed by DOE. 
The data request sheets initially provided for the AHAM incremental cost data 
collection effort are in the framework document as Tables A-7A through A-7F of that 
document. The data collection effort was later modified to include a 35% efficiency level 
and to reduce the 15% efficiency level to 10% in order to provide an intermediate first 
level. Data was submitted to AHAM by manufacturers and this data was aggregated in 
preparation for submission to DOE, so that no reported data would represent responses 
from fewer than three manufacturers. 
Sufficient data was collected to allow reporting of incremental costs for product 
classes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, although for product classes 5 and 11 the reporting was for only 
one of the product sizes. 
After receipt of the data, DOE posed follow-up questions, some through AHAM 
and some directly with individual manufacturers, to improve understanding of the results. 
DOE requested that AHAM provide indication of what percent of shipments within each 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22

product class was represented by reported information, so that the results for capital 
investments and one-time expenditures could more accurately be allocated to individual 
products. DOE also requested clarification regarding whether the capital investments and 
one-time expenditures reported for the two sizes of a product class would be added to 
provide total costs for the product class, or whether any portion of the cost would 
overlap. AHAM requested clarification on this question from members, and the response 
was that there is very little overlap in reporting of these costs. 
The following sections present the AHAM data and comparisons with DOE 
results by product class.

Figure  5.9.4 Incremental Cost Curves for Product Class 3 
 
Per-product incremental cost associated with capital expenditures and one-time 
expenses have been calculated as follows based on the AHAM data for these cost 
categories. Total reported industry expenditures for each of the four categories (building, 
equipment, R&D, marketing) are divided by the percent of shipments represented by the 
data as reported by AHAM to determine the total industry value of each of these 
expenditures. These values are then added to obtain the total one-time expenditures for 
the product class for each of the two product class sizes for which data was provided. The 
one-time expenditures for the small and large size products are added to obtain total 
product class one-time expenditures. For product classes for which data were reported for 
only one of the sizes (product classes 5 and 11), the total for the size is doubled to 
represent the total one-time expenditures for the entire product class. Allocation of the 
one-time expenditures is based on the projected shipments for the product class for the 
first 10 years of the life of the new standard as determined for the NIA. The expenditures 
are divided by the total of these shipments to determine the impact of one-time 
expenditures per unit. This value is then added to the incremental costs for the product 
represented by materials, labor, and overhead.

The data provided for the 21 ft3 product class 3 refrigerator-freezers includes 
results for the average, the maximum, and the minimum cost data provided by 
manufacturers responding to the query for incremental cost data. Different numbers of 
responses were obtained for the average than for the minimum and maximum, as 
indicated in Table  5.9.2. The results for minimum and maximum, provided by 
manufacturers representing 57% of shipments for product class 3, are nearly equal. This 
suggests that the average cost data provided by these same manufacturers is nearly equal 
to these minimum and maximum values. The cost curve for these manufacturers, shown 
in Figure  5.9.4 with adjustments for capital and one-time expenditures, agrees very well 
with DOE results. The average cost data provided by the manufacturer(s) representing the 
remaining 42% of the product class shipments must have been quite high. 
 
In spite of the apparently good agreement between the DOE results and the 
AHAM data for the manufacturers who reported minimum and maximum incremental 
costs, there still remains a key discrepancy. DOE discussed the data submittals with some 
manufacturers after AHAM’s aggregation of the data, and the manufacturers reported that 
insulation thickness increases were considered as part of the design options associated 
with the data. Since DOE’s results did not consider insulation thickness increases, it 
would be expected that the DOE results would indicate higher costs.

The AHAM incremental cost data for product class 5 is compared with the 
calculations carried out by DOE in Figure  5.9.5 below. The DOE costs in these curves 
have the manufacturer markup taken out so that they can be compared on a consistent 
basis. The AHAM curves include material, labor, overhead, and depreciation and one-
time expenses. The AHAM and DOE data are in good agreement, except at the 25% and 
30% efficiency levels. However, as with product class 3, the agreement may not be 
entirely consistent because the DOE results did not consider insulation thickness 
increases.

For the 22 ft3 product 7 size, capital and one-time expenditure data was provided 
only for tooling/equipment costs. To assure that building, R&D, and marketing costs 
have been considered, the R&D and marketing costs for this product size have been set 
equal to the equivalent costs for the 26 ft3 product size. The building capital cost has been 
assumed to be proportional to tooling/equipment capital cost for product class 7. For 
product class 7, the DOE cost estimates are higher than the AHAM data at higher 
efficiency levels. However, the leveling off of the AHAM 25 ft3 curve is expected to be 
an anomaly of the reporting and aggregation process—this feature of the curve is not 
expected to be representative of the actual cost trend for this product.

The AHAM incremental cost data for product class 11 are compared with the

have the manufacturer markup taken out so that they can be compared on a consistent 
basis. The AHAM curves include material, labor, overhead, and depreciation and one-

estimate for the 20% efficiency level is puzzling, because this is the ENERGY STAR 
level. DOE considers it unlikely that ENERGY STAR products of this product class 
could have $75 higher production cost than baseline efficiency products. Such products 
listed in the ENERGY STAR database are shown in Figure  5.9.9 below. The differences 
between the baseline and ENERGY STAR 4 ft3 refrigerators of the reverse engineering 
work include a larger evaporator, a different compressor, and slightly thicker walls, 
differences that would incur an order of magnitude less than $75 in additional production 
cost. The design option analysis uses a slightly different combination to achieve the 20% 
efficiency level: thicker wall, higher compressor efficiency, and a larger condenser.

APPENDIX 5-A.  ENGINEERING DATA  
5-A.1 INTRODUCTION  
The Energy-efficient Refrigerator Analysis Program (ERA) was used to calculate energy 
use for baseline and energy-saving configurations for the various product classes of refrigeration 
products. Inputs to this program were generated from reverse-engineering teardowns of select 
refrigerator and refrigerator-freezer models currently available. The values for the input variables 
are shown in tabular format in section  5-A.2. The input is provided to the extent possible in the 
format required for the Windows version of ERA. Because analysis was carried out with the 
DOE version of ERA for most of the products, in some cases the input format may not translate 
directly, and the output values may not match exactly.  
The incremental cost curves describing costs to attain each analyzed efficiency level are 
based on the energy use output from the ERA program. Development of costs for these curves is 
described in chapter 5. The tables in section  5-A.3 show these incremental cost curves in tabular 
format, with identification of the design options required to reach each efficiency level shown.  
As part of the engineering analysis, DOE solicited input from manufacturers on a range 
of technical topics affecting energy use in refrigeration products. The questionnaire used to 
facilitate these interviews is shown in section 5-A.4. 
5-A.2 ERA INPUTS 
The ERA inputs for each of the units selected for reverse-engineering analysis are shown 
below. Some general notes regarding the data include the following: 
1.  Compressor compartment insulation thickness is specified directly in Windows ERA, 
while DOS ERA used bottom wall thickness.   
2.  The ERA input for door openings is not provided, since DOE conducted analysis 
based on closed doors. 
3.  Windows ERA includes separate input for the air in the compressor compartment. 
DOS ERA used the air temperature underneath the cabinet for this region.
4.  DOE conducted all analyses using single evaporator system configuration with HFC-
134a refrigerant. 
5.  The tube and fin heat exchanger configuration implies forced convection air flow. 
6.  See the Windows ERA program for definitions of air flow directions for forced 
convection wire fin condensers.

7.  Some products analyzed had spine fin evaporators, which are not supported by ERA. 
Input for a separate spine fin analysis spreadsheet calculation is provided in the tables 
below for these products. 
8.  Windows ERA does not allow superheat or subcooling input of 0 ˚C, although DOS 
ERA does. Suggested input is 0.5 ˚C in cases where input of 0 ˚C is indicated.

m The rated freezer volume is 0.7 ft3 as indicated, but the volume based on observed freezer dimensions is 0.4 ft3 
n This product is classified as an all-refrigerator for testing and rating purposes, since its freezer compartment is less 
than 0.5 ft3 in volume. It is not clear wheter the 4 ft3 E* product was also rated as an all-refrigerator based on
available data. DOE analyzed both 4 ft3 products as basic refrigerators and the 1.7 ft3 product as an all-refrigerator.

illustrated in the line in the plot below?   
•  Note that while a range of EER is offered by compressor vendors, it is not clear that the range of 
EER’s actually being used in products is as broad--Is this driven by cost pressures for compact 
products?

APPENDIX 5-B. ERA MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND WINERA USERS MANUAL 
5-B.1 INTRODUCTION 
The Energy-efficient Refrigerator Analysis Program (ERA), formerly called the EPA 
Refrigerator Analysis Program, serves as an important tool in the engineering analysis, described 
in Chapter 5 of the TSD. This appendix provides background description of the evolution of the 
program since its creation in the late 1980s, provides details regarding changes made to the 
program as part of this rulemaking, and provides program operation guidance for the user. ERA 
has undergone extensive analytical upgrades and has also been converted to a Window-based 
program. The program has its own internal help utility to provide additional assistance to the user 
beyond the information provided in this appendix. 
5-B.2 HISTORY OF ERA MODEL 
ERA has seen several major improvements since its creation. This section describes the 
characteristics of the initial version of ERA and the subsequent modifications to the model prior 
to the current DOE rulemaking, including involvement in the Thailand refrigeration appliance 
efficiency standards analysis and in refrigerator energy use analysis training workshops in China 
in the 1990s. 
5-B.2.1 DOE Refrigeration Appliance Efficiency Standards 
Preparation of the current DOS version of ERA (EPA Refrigerator Analysis Program)
was initiated under EPA-sponsorship during the late 1980s.  This was undertaken by the EPA as 
part its involvement in the establishment of energy standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-
freezers, and freezers under the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA).  
A developmental version of the program was used by the DOE (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory) 
as a partial basis for the energy standard established in 1989 (effective in 1993).  The LBL work 
also involved an extensive testing of the model against manufacturer-supplied refrigeration 
appliance design and test data. Based on these comparisons and manufacturer review comments 
through its industry organization (AHAM), development of the model continued until its release 
in 1997 [1]. 
ERA combined an analysis of the refrigeration load requirements of the cabinet with a 
simulation of the capacity and efficiency of the refrigeration cycle.  The cabinet loads module 
was a modest enhancement of a program developed for the DOE during the late 1970s [2], 
including the consideration of door-opening effects on the load and an ability to deal with 
complex insulation systems.  The cycle module was a derivative of the NIST CYCLE 7 program
[3] which used the CSD equation of state to represent the thermodynamic properties of pure and 
mixed refrigerants [4], adapting routines for calculating refrigerant properties from REFPROP3 
[5]. Using this new program, EPA carried out an extensive investigation of the potential for 
energy efficiency improvements [6].

The program, and its User’s Manual, were first released to the public in 1993, and for a few 
years were downloadable from the EPA website [7]. 
Subsequent to the 1993 final rule, DOE published updated standards for refrigerators, 
refrigerator-freezers and freezers in 1997, becoming effective in 2001.  This involved use of the 
final released EPA version of ERA [1].

Under three separate contracts from the Thai National Energy Policy Office, a modified
version of the program was used by the program authora to establish minimum efficiency 
performance standards (MEPS) for residential refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers used in 
Thailand [8, 9, 10]. The first study established goals for two categories of appliances: a one-door 
manual defrost refrigerator, and a two-door automatic-defrost refrigerator-freezer.  Three levels 
of MEPS were proposed, a “long-term goal” (assumed to be achievable within 10 years, and 
tier1 and tier 2 standards which allowed 30% and 15% energy use over the long-term goal. 
As in the earlier DOE work, the local manufacturing industry was involved in the review 
and assessment of the proposed standard.   
In response to highly negative comments on the achievability of any of the proposed 
efficiency levels, a second contract was awarded to prepare and test refrigerators that would meet 
or exceed the long-term energy target.  Working with Sano Electric Company of Thailand, four 
prototype units were designed and tested: 31-liter and 41.5-liter one-door refrigerators, and 78.5-
liter and 126.5-liter two-door refrigerator-freezers.  Using available technology, the achieved 
energy reductions were over 20% for the one-door units, and over 34% for the two-door units, 
meeting the long-term target levels. Within several years, the proposed standards became law.   
5-B.2.3 ERA Training Workshop in China 
In response to a request from China’s State Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS), 
LBNL hosted a training seminar on the use of ERA for three research engineers.  The results of 
this training provided an increased understanding of approaches to achieve improved standards, 
leading to a more substantial series of cost-effective cooperative efforts towards creating China’s 
standards program [11].   
As part of a subsequent large program sponsored by the UN Global Environmental Fund (GEF), 
ThermoSoft carried out a one-week training workshop in Beijing [12].  The participants included 
40 engineers from 20 manufacturers located throughout China.  Although focused on the use of 
ERA as a design tool, the workshop covered the then-current component technologies available 
a A consultant, established under the name ThermoSoft.   This work was subcontracted through ERM-Siam.

worldwide, providing an opportunity for a lively exchange of ideas.  Each of the participants 
utilized ERA to perform analyses of their proprietary appliance models.   
5-B.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DOS VERSION OF ERA 
ERA was developed employing then-current computer technology of the 1980s.  The 
cabinet loads module was a minor upgrade of an earlier program used for efficiency standards, 
and an existing simplified heat pump cycle model was adapted to represent the refrigerator cycle.
Written in FORTRAN, with a very extensive set of assembly language routines to provide a 
smooth user-interface, the program was hosted in DOS.   
Because of the complexities of the program, and the limitations of DOS, it was broken 
into three modules, linked by data files and a batch file that managed the information and 
program execution flow.  Both the MENU module (which provided the user-input interface) and 
the cycle execution module used nearly all of the available 600+ Kbytes of DOS accessible 
memory.b  This memory limitation, inherent in DOS (which can address only 655,360 bytes of 
conventional memory, 10 x 216), imposed a fundamental limitation on the design of the program
and the details that could be considered in any analysis. 
ERA was constructed to take maximum advantage of the available capabilities provided 
by DOS, leading to somewhat complicated coding and sharing of memory spaces for certain 
functions. Because of the limitations imposed by DOS, ERA was designed to fit within the 
capabilities of a specific compiler, Microsoft FORTRAN 5.0, which was discontinued in the 
early 1990s. As a result, ERA is not compliable with any other version FORTRAN compiler.  
Further, the program requires access to the specially-developed assembly language user-interface 
module. As a consequence, although the source code has been made available upon request, no 
entity other than ThermoSoft has been able to compile it. 
Because of these restrictions, the thermophysical property routines within the DOS 
version cannot be upgraded beyond Refprop 4.0, nor can additional fluids be considered.c 
Hence, no changes to the refrigerant properties capabilities of ERA have been made since the 
mid-1990s.   
5-B.3.1 Modifications to ERA Since its Public Release
Given the DOS-imposed restrictions, options for upgrades to the model have been limited 
within this environment.  However, during on the work in Thailand, several minor enhancements 
were made: 
b Of course, the program executable object had to load within this space, limiting the available memory space for 
data objects. 
c Later versions of Refprop use a different structure.

x  Calculation of the hot-wall effective heat transfer area.  This involved specification of the 
tubing routing and additional details about the wall area.  The outer shell, to which the 
tubing is pressed by the expanded foam, was treated as a thermal fin to estimate the 
effective heat transfer area. This capability was used during the development of the 
prototype models in Thailand while investigating the effects of improved hot wall design 
of the energy use. 
x  Addition of a similar analysis sub-model to calculate the effective heat transfer area for a 
cold-wall evaporator.   
x  Added multiple-speed capability to the compressor model.  The efficiency-based model, 
which was valid only for R-12, was removed to provide this capability.   
x  Improved evaporator analysis in the single-door refrigerator to more correctly incorporate 
the radiative heat transfer effects.  This led to an improvement between the model 
predictions and test results for the compact-refrigerator category.   
Although no changes to the model were made in the model’s use of compressor maps, 
experience working with Thai manufacturers highlighted the importance of high-quality 
calorimeter data.d  As a result, each of the manufacturer-supplied maps was analyzed for 
consistency by examining the corresponding volumetric and isentropic efficiencies.  An ability to 
qualify a compressor map on the basis of the underlying volumetric and isentropic efficiencies is 
built into the current revision of the model (see below). 
d Similar experience with poorly constructed manufacturer-supplied compressor maps was encountered during the 
EPA Multiple Pathways project [6].

5-B.4 OBJECTIVES OF THE CURRENT PROJECT 
A thorough revision of the ERA program, now entitled the “Energy-Efficient 
Refrigerator Analysis” program, is being undertaken for the current rulemaking to meet the 
following objectives: 
x  Enhancement of the user-interface to a Windows environment 
x  Employment of the most current refrigerant property routines 
x  Incorporation of a broad range of evaporator and condenser algorithms that correspond to 
the technologies now found in modern refrigerators 
x  Improved compressor modeling, with built-in procedures for validating supplied  
compressor maps  
x  Improvements where desirable in the cabinet loads analysis and cycle performance 
algorithms. 
x  Preparation of internal documentation of the program through extensive context-sensitive 
Help files.   
In addition to these objectives, support has been provided in the use of the DOS-version 
of ERA for the current standards development work.  To assist this effort, a small suite of stand-
alone programs has been prepared to calculate the required input values to ERA.  This suite 
consists of: 
ERAEVAP – for the calculation of the net heat transfer capabilities of a variety of 
evaporator designs; 
ERACOND – for the calculation of the net heat transfer capabilities of a variety of 
condenser designs; and 
COMPMAP – a program to validate compressor maps by the calculation and display of 
isentropic and volumetric efficiencies, and the construction of new maps based on 
methods for smoothing the efficiencies as a function of compression ratio.   
Each of these models contains algorithms that will be incorporated into the final 
Windows version of ERA, including the refrigerant algorithms.  They are stand-alone programs, 
designed only for interim use. However, since they provide a technical basis for the new version 
of ERA and have been used in the ongoing engineering analyses, they are described next.

5-B.4.1 Evaporator Analysis Program – ERAEVAP 
User Interface 
ERAEVAP is a data-wizard based 
Windows program that guides the user 
through several steps in the specification 
of the evaporator design parameters.   
Step1 requires selection of the heat 
exchanger type (roll-bond freezer 
compartment, tube and fin fan-forced 
evaporator, or a chest freezer cold-wall).  
Three options are represented for a tube 
and fin configuration: plain fin, smooth 
wavy fin, and herringbone fin. 
Refrigerant choices are: R134a, R152a, R290 (propane), R404A, R507A, R600a (isobutane), and 
R744 (carbon dioxide). Refrigerant properties are calculated using the NIST Refprop 8.0 
routines, supplied as a linkable dll. 
Other typical value operating parameters are user-specified: refrigerant mass-flow, refrigerant 
saturation temperature, refrigerant inlet quality, return or cabinet air temperature, and the airflow 
rate and corresponding fan efficiency (fan-forced analyses only).e 
Step 2 depends on the heat exchanger 
configuration selected above. The 
illustration shows the input dialog for a 
tube and wavy fin design. In this 
instance, the tube dimensions, vertical 
pitch (normal to the air flow) and 
horizontal pitch (along the direction of 
the air flow) are specified. 
Each data dialog contains a simple 
illustration of the component under 
consideration. 
e These data must be user-defined since the program is not integrated into an overall cycle analysis.

Step 3, in this example, presents a dialog 
that requests information on the design of 
the fin. For the example of a wavy fin, 
the requested data are: fin thickness and 
pitch, fin thermal conductivity, fraction 
of the tube row that is finned, and fin 
pattern depth. 
The number of steps required to define 
the evaporator depends on the design. 
For example, roll-bond and chest freezer 
evaporators only require two steps. 
Results displayed depend on the type of 
evaporator modeled. In the case of a tube 
and fin design, the output includes the fin 
heat transfer area and effectiveness, the 
total effective heat transfer area, air-side 
pressure drop and fan energy, and the 
refrigerant-side pressure drop. In 
addition, the display lists the overall U-
values that are to be used as input to 
ERA. These are shown specific to the 
input requirements of the DOS version of 
ERA.f 
Roll-bond Evaporator 
ERAEVAP uses the Dittus-Bolter equation [13] to determine the heat transfer coefficients for the 
air and the vapor phase of the refrigerant. A radiative component is added on the air-side.  
Liquid phase heat transfer is calculated using the Bo Pierre correlation [14].  The overall heat 
transfer rate is dominated by the air-side resistance. Heat transfer resistance across the roll-bond 
surface is assumed to be negligible. 
The pressure drop in the evaporating heat transfer regime is calculated by marching stepwise 
downstream, calculating the local pressure gradient, and summing the local pressure drops to 
determine the total pressure drop. The local pressure drop is calculated using the Lockhart-
Martinelli correlation [15]. 
f As noted earlier, the stand-alone programs are intended only as an assist towards preparing input values needed by
DOS ERA.  Hence, they are considered an interim step in the development of the final Windows version of the
updated ERA program.

Chest Freezer Cold Wall 
Both air-side and refrigerant-side heat transfer rates are determined in the same manner as with a 
roll-bond. Calculation of the refrigerant pressure drop also uses the Lockhart-Martinelli 
correlation. 
The refrigerant tubes are pressed on the inside surface of the chest freezer liner, which because 
of its small thickness acts like a thermal fin.  With adjustment made for the end tubes, each 
parallel tube is represented as having a fin of width: 
Wf = Width of plate normal to the tube / (2 * number of tubes), 
The effectiveness for this equivalent fin is: 
Ș = (k į / h) 0.5 tanh [Wf * ( h / k į) 
0.5] / Wf 
For typical designs the effectiveness should be close to unity. 
Tube and Fin Evaporator 
Three fin options are modeled for the tube and fin design: plain fin, wavy fin, and herringbone 
fin. Refrigerant-side heat transfer and pressure drop are calculated in the same manner as 
described above. The air-side heat transfer rate depends on the type of fin and its design. 
Equations for representing plain fin and herringbone fin designs were based on studies by Wang 
[16]. The wavy fin configuration was represented by correlations published by Mirth and 
Ramadhyani [17].g  Because the correlations are quite complex, they are not reproduced here.  
However, both references are readily available. 
The modeling and calculation approaches used in ERAEVAP will be employed in the final 
Windows version of ERA where analyses of the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of 
the evaporator will be built into the program.  ERAEVAP will not be part of the Windows ERA 
package. 
g Reference [16] is a summary of many studies performed and published by Wang and his colleagues for a wide
variety of fin configurations, including louver fins, and slit-fins.  It includes a summary of the work done on wavy
fins by Mirth and Ramadhyani, but incorrectly reproduces their correlation.

5-B.4.2 Condenser Analysis Program – ERACOND 
Condenser Design Options 
Four generic classes of condensers are 
modeled: 1) static condenser, 2) various 
tube and fin designs, 3) microchannel 
design, and 4) a hot wall condenser.  For 
each of these, the user defines the 
refrigerant mass flow rate, the saturation 
temperature, and the temperature of the 
environment (room or under-cabinet).  
The air flow rate and fan efficiency are 
also specified for the fan-forced designs. 
Static Condenser 
The static condenser model uses 
correlations developed by Bansal and 
Chin [18], who relied heavily on the 
work by Tagliafico and Tamda [19].  
Design data include tube spacing and 
length, wire diameter, conductivity, and 
length, and the number of wires on both 
sides of the tubing. Heat transfer from 
the connecting bare tube is included in 
the analysis.
Refrigerant-side heat transfer is calculated according to the Shah correlation [20, 21].  Pressure 
drop is calculated according to the Lockhart-Martinelli correlation, assuming for the purposes of 
analysis that 15% of the tube is in the superheated vapor phase regime, 80% in two-phase 
condensation, and 5% in the subcooled regime.h 
All of the condenser models to be described use the same approach to determining refrigerant-
side heat transfer and pressure drop. 
Wire Fin Condensers 
h This assumption will be replaced by the cycle model for the condenser in the Windows version of ERA, which will 
model the entire cycle system.   
5-B-9  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wire fin condensers are found  in many 
domestic refrigerators.  ERACOND 
provides three options for air flow across 
the unit, listed in the data dialog as along 
the W-, L- or H-directions. Since the heat 
exchanger is normally located under the 
cabinet in the compressor space, not all 
of the air flow will cross the unit.  Hence, 
a required input is the fraction of the total 
air flow through the condenser. 
Calculation of the air-side heat transfer rate employs the Lee, et al correlation [22], which 
accounts for the orientation of the heat exchanger relative to the air flow.  
Tube and Extended Fins
Calculation of the fin heat transfer uses 
the Wang correlations [16] for the plain 
fin, the herringbone fin, and the slit fin 
configurations. Representation of a wavy 
fin heat transfer uses the Mirth and 
Ramadhyani correlation [17]. 
Both sets of correlations also estimate the 
air flow pressure drop thought the fins. 
Although calculated and displayed in the 
output, they do not consider other air 
flow restrictions, and therefore represent 
low values for the fan energy.

Hotwall Condenser 
A hotwall condenser can be modeled as a 
single wall, as in a chest freezer, or by
multiple walls, as in an upright freezer or 
refrigerator.  The heat transfer 
effectiveness of each wall is determined.  
As with the evaporator cold wall, the
major heat flow resistance is on the air-
side. An overall pressure drop is 
calculated for the connected tubing using 
the Lockhart-Martinelli algorithm, with 
the Shah correlation used for the 
refrigerant condensing regime. 
Microchannel and Louver Design 
A microchannel condenser is assumed to  
use a louver-type fin. The refrigerant-
side design determines the refrigerant 
flow rates and corresponding heat 
transfer coefficients and pressure drop.  
Design parameters for the louver 
determine the air-side heat transfer and 
air flow pressure drop. They are 
calculated using correlations developed 
by Wang [16].   
These same correlations, adopted by ERA, are used in the current (Mark VI) on-line version of 
the Oak Ridge heat pump model [23].   
Compressor Model – COMPMAP 
COMPMAP is an auxiliary program to the Windows version of ERA.  The program graphically 
displays the isentropic and volumetric efficiencies implied by a compressor map, as a function of 
pressure ratio, providing a visual indication of whether the map is well formed.  If desired, the 
map can be rebuilt based on various options for smoothing these underlying efficiencies.   
5-B-11  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COMPMAP may also be used to scale an 
existing map to a different COP and/or 
capacity. The program can import maps 
previously used with the DOS version of 
ERA or prepare new maps for use with 
the DOS version 
COMPMAP can be used in stand-alone 
mode or can be directly called by ERA. 
This provides a built-in tool to validate 
and prepare maps for use in a simulation.  
No assumption is made about the specific dependence of isentropic or volumetric efficiency on 
pressure ratio, other than that some correlation should exit.  Using the efficiency values 
calculated for the particular map, the user is offered a choice of using the map as-is, or using a 
linear or quadratic smoothing of the efficiencies against the pressure ratio. This can be done for 
individual condenser temperatures if desired, preserving much of the original map while 
removing apparent randomness of performance as a function of the evaporator temperature.   
5-B.4.3 Windows Version of ERA 
User Interface 
ERA uses a highly-graphical interface, providing multiple options for selecting from the various 
cabinet and component choices.  It is designed to guide the user carefully through the data input 
and editing process to ensure data consistency.  Prior to an actual simulation of the refrigeration 
appliance performance, the user is presented a summary of the selected design variables.

EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabinet Mode 
ERA operates in one of four view modes: 
1) cabinet design mode (shown in the 
image), 2) cycle design mode, 3) 
simulation mode, and 4) reports mode.  
Each is characterized by its own sidebar, 
containing hotspots for selecting 
component or report options.  The color 
of the sidebar provides an additional 
visual clue to highlight the particular 
mode that is current. 
To define a new analysis, the user may either begin with a default set of design parameters and 
proceed through the editing process, or may read in an existing data file to be used as-is or 
edited. 
Each analysis must begin with a selection of the basic cabinet design parameters: cabinet 
category (shown on the desktop) and the overall dimensions of the unit. Once these basic choices 
have been made, the remaining categories of cabinet design data may be specified in any order.  
Data wizards, similar to those illustrated above for the stand-alone programs, guide the user at 
each stage. 
As each category of data is processed, a check mark is drawn on the sidebar to indicate the 
completeness of the editing progress. 
In some instances, special-function dialogs may be 
summoned to assist in the preparation of an input value.  
For example, the image to the right shows a dialog used to 
calculate the effective resistivity of a cabinet wall that 
contains a vacuum panel or some equivalent high thermal 
resistance element.

Cycle Mode 
Once the basic cabinet type has been 
selected, the user may specify the cycle 
parameters.  This would begin with a 
selection of the basic cycle type (single 
evaporator, dual loop, dual evaporator, or 
Lorenz cycle). Once this choice has been 
made, a simple schematic of the chosen 
cycle category is displayed on the 
desktop. The user may then continue to 
define the cycle parameters by clicking 
on the desktop to select the component of 
interest, or may use the sidebar or the  
the drop-down menu to select the next component to be defined.   
The displayed desktop image and its associated hotspots depend on the specific cycle category 
selected. 
Simulation Mode 
Prior to simulation of the cabinet loads 
and cycle behavior, the user is presented 
with a summary of the defined input.  A 
data item can be selected for further 
editing by double-clicking on the 
summary line displaying the item in the 
data review dialog. 
Once the data has been reviewed and
accepted, the user selects the Continue 
button to start the simulation.

EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reports Mode 
At the completion of the simulation (which 
is instantaneous for the cabinet loads), the 
program automatically switches to reports 
mode and displays the results on the 
desktop. The example here shows the 
calculated cabinet loads.  Results for the 
cycle analysis, overall performance 
parameters, or a more detailed summary, 
can be selected using the side-bar or the 
drop-down menu for reports.   
Cabinet Loads 
As of this preliminary documentation, only the cabinet loads have been modeled. 
Each of the cabinet walls has at least one beveled edge where it joins another wall.  Hence, some
adjustment needs to be made for the difference between the inside and outside surfaces of the 
wall – that is, the conduction is not strictly one-dimensional.  Detailed finite difference 
calculations carried out for a flat wall with adiabatic beveled edges (where the walls connect) 
show that a very good approximation can be obtained by representing the beveled wall as an 
equivalent wall of one dimensional heat transfer, where the equivalent wall area is: 
Areaequiv = 0.25 Areaoutside + 0.75 Areainside 
This is nearly identical to the method adopted in the DOS version of ERA, which also made 
adjustments for corner effects where three walls join.  Hence, the previous methodology was 
retained, with minor corrections made as needed.   
The loads analysis does not yet consider cycle-dependent interactions such as hot- or cold-walls, 
fan energies, defrost, or other cycle-dependent heat terms.  These will be incorporated during the 
cycle portion of the simulation. 
Refrigerant Properties 
The fluid choices for the refrigeration cycle are: R134a, R152a, R290, R404A, R507A, or 
R600a. Thermodynamic properties are based on Refprop 8.0 [24].  To speed the computations, 
an approach to using the Helmholtz equation of state outlined by one of the authors of Refprop 
[25] has been adopted as the primary simulation option for ERA.  This reference contains 
required property data for R-404A and R-507A. Data for the other refrigerants represented by 
ERA have been obtained from the Refprop fluid database.

A secondary option to use the full set of the more comprehensive, but considerably slower,i 
Refprop routines will be offered for those instances when the user might wish to confirm the 
simulated performance.   
Because Refprop does not supply a complete set of thermophysical properties for all of the 
refrigerants over the full set of temperatures and pressures, correlations for the thermal 
conductivity and viscosity were developed from refrigerant manufacturer literature. In general, 
uncertainties in these properties are less important than uncertainties in the thermodynamic 
properties since the net heat transfer resistance is normally dominated by the air-side.   
Cycle Analysis 
The cycle model, currently under development, will adopt the general approach employed in the 
DOS version of ERA. An iterative solution procedure will be required to simultaneously satisfy 
the heat transfer and mass flow equations throughout the loop.  Where the cycle components 
affect the cabinet loads, adjustments to the loads will be calculated.   
Several major differences will appear between the Windows and DOS versions of ERA: 
x  Only a map-based compressor model will be used.  This decision is based on experience 
gained using ERA with actual equipment, where compressor information for the actual 
unit was needed to accurately reflect the energy consumption.  The accompanying 
compressor module, COMPMAP, can be employed to create or modify map data. 
x  The heat exchanger performance routines will be integrated into the overall cycle 
simulation.  Hence, the effects of parameters such as refrigerant mass flow, and entering 
temperature and pressure on the heat exchanger performance will be automatically taken 
into account at each stage of the simulation. 
x  An improved iteration approach will be used to ensure rapid and proper convergence.  
The solution method used in the ORNL Mark series heat pump looks promising [26].  
Tools 
The new version of ERA provides several tools to assist in preparing the program inputs and in 
interpreting the results: 
Compressor Map program. COMPMAP may be run directly from ERA by selecting this option 
from the Tools menu.  It provides a means of viewing and/or adjusting a map that is to be used in 
i Both Lemmon [25] and ThermoSoft experience obtained with a heat pump model confirm that the Helmholtz 
method can result in computation time reductions of a factor of 30 to 40 over the full set of Refprop routines.

the cycle simulation. When selected, ERA is minimized until the compressor map program is 
dismissed, 
Refrigerant Properties. A calculation of the refrigerant properties for the selected refrigerant 
can be made given certain specified state points.  The calculations are carried out using the 
Helmholtz method.   
Unit Conversion. This tool can be used to convert to different units values of length, flow rate, 
temperature, thermal conductivity, volume, energy, or power.

CHAPTER 6.  MARKUPS FOR EQUIPMENT PRICE DETERMINATION 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
To carry out its analyses, DOE needed to determine the cost to the consumer of baseline 
products and the cost of more-efficient units. As discussed in chapter 8, DOE developed retail 
prices for baseline products using proprietary retail price data collected by The NPD Group. For 
products with higher-than-baseline efficiency, DOE estimated the consumer prices by applying 
appropriate markups to the manufacturer incremental equipment costs estimated in the 
engineering analysis. 
6.1.1 Distribution Channels 
The appropriate markups for determining consumer equipment prices depend on the type 
of distribution channels through which products move from manufacturers to purchasers.  At 
each point in the distribution channel, companies mark up the price of the equipment to cover 
their business costs and profit margin.   
Data from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM)1 indicate that an 
overwhelming majority of residential appliances are sold through retail outlets.  Because DOE is 
not aware of any other distribution channel that plays a significant role for residential 
refrigeration products, DOE assumed that all of the residential products are purchased by 
consumers from retail outlets. DOE did not include a separate distribution channel for 
refrigeration products included as part of a new home, as it did not have information on the 
extent to which these products are “pre-installed” by builders in new homes. 
6.2 MARKUP CALCULATION PROCEDURE 
As just discussed, at each point in the distribution channel, companies mark up the price 
of the equipment to cover their business costs and profit margin.  In financial statements, gross 
margin is the difference between the company revenue and the company cost of sales or cost of 
goods sold (CGS). Inputs for calculating the gross margin are all corporate costs—including 
overhead costs (sales, general, and administration); research and development (R&D) and 
interest expenses; depreciation, and taxes—and profits.  In order for sales of a product to 
contribute positively to company cash flow, the product’s markup must be greater than the 
corporate gross margin.  Individual products may command a lower or higher markup, 
depending on their perceived added value and the competition they face from similar products in 
the market. 
In developing markups for manufacturers and retailers, DOE obtained data about the 
revenue, CGS, and expenses of firms that produce and sell the products of interest.  For retailers, 
DOE’s approach categorizes the expenses into two categories: labor-scaling costs (LSC), which

are fixed labor and occupancy expenses that increase in proportion to the amount of labor 
required to produce or sell the product, and non-labor-scaling costs (NLSC), which are variable 
operating costs that do not scale with labor and vary in proportion to CGS. 
6.2.1 Approach for Manufacturer Markups 
DOE uses manufacturer markups to transform a manufacturer’s equipment costs into a 
manufacturer sales price.  Using the CGS and gross margin, DOE calculated the manufacturer 
markup (MUMFG) with the following equation:
CGS + GMMFG MFGMU MFG = CGSMFG 
where: 
MUMFG = Manufacturer markup, 
CGSMFG = Manufacturer’s cost of goods sold or Manufacturer Production Cost 
(MPC), and
GMMFG = Manufacturer’s gross margin. 
 The manufacturer’s CGS (or MPC) plus its GM equals the manufacturer selling price 
(MSP). 
6.2.2 Approach for Retailer Markups 
DOE based the retailer markups for residential refrigeration products on financial data 
from the U.S. Census Business Expenditure Survey.  DOE organized the financial data into 
balance sheets that break down cost components incurred by firms that sell the products.a  The 
key assumptions that DOE used to estimate the retailer markups using these financial data were:  
1.  The balance sheets faithfully represent the various average costs incurred by firms selling 
home appliances. 
2.  These costs can be divided into two categories:
a.  Costs that vary in proportion to the manufacturer sales price (variable costs); and 
b.  Costs that do not vary with the manufacturer sales price (fixed costs). 
3.  Retailer sales prices vary in proportion to retailer costs that are included in the balance 
sheets. 
In support of the first assumption, the balance sheets itemize firm costs into a number of 
expense categories, including CGS, operating labor and occupancy costs, and other operating 
a The retailers to whom these financial data refer handle multiple commodity lines.

costs and profit.  Although retailers tend to handle multiple commodity lines, the data provide 
the most accurate available indication of home appliance expenses. 
Information obtained from the trade literature pertaining to the heating, ventilation, and 
air-conditioning (HVAC) contracting industry tends to support the second assumption.  This 
information indicates that retailer markups should vary according to the quantity of labor and 
materials used to sell or distribute the equipment, with markups on labor tending to be much 
larger than markups on materials.2  This information also describes markups as varying much 
more in relation to sales volume than in relation to other factors, including appliance efficiency.  
This last finding strongly suggests that labor inputs vary more with sales volume than with 
appliance cost or efficiency. In the discussion that follows in section 6.3, DOE assumes a 
division of costs between those that do not scale with the manufacturer sales price (fixed costs— 
labor and occupancy expenses referred to above as LSC), and those that do (variable costs— 
operating expenses and profit referred to above as NLSC). This division of costs led to the 
estimate of retailer markups described below in section 6.3.  
In support of the third assumption, the retailer industries are relatively competitive, and 
consumer demand for residential home appliances is relatively inelastic, i.e. the demand is not 
expected to decrease significantly with a relatively small increase in price.  The large number of 
household appliance stores listed by the U.S. Census Bureau in its Statistics of U.S. Businesses
indicates the competitive nature of the market.3  For example, there are more than 10,000 
household appliance store establishments and over 5000 merchant wholesaler establishments of 
service equipment in the U.S.b  According to standard economic theory, competitive firms facing 
inelastic demand either set prices in line with costs or quickly go out of business.4 
Using the above assumptions, DOE developed baseline and incremental markups to 
transform the manufacturer sales price into a consumer equipment price.  DOE used the baseline 
markups, which cover all of a retailer’s costs (i.e., both LSC and NLSC), to determine the sales 
price of baseline models.  The baseline markup relates the manufacturer sales price to the retailer 
sales price. DOE considers baseline models to be equipment sold under existing market 
conditions (i.e., without new energy efficiency standards).  DOE calculated the baseline markup 
(MUBASE) for retailers using the following equation: 
CGSRTL / DIST + GM RTL / DIST CGSRTL / DIST + ( LSC RTL / DIST + NLSC RTL / DIST )MU = = BASE CGS CGSRTL / DIST RTL / DIST 
where: 
MUBASE = Baseline retailer markup, 
CGSRTL/DIST = Retailer’s cost of goods sold, 
GMRTL/DIST = Retailer’s gross margin,  
b DOE determined the number of establishments for household appliance stores based on the following North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and description: 443111, Household Appliance Stores. 
6-3  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
LSCRTL/DIST = Retailer’s labor-scaling costs, and 
NLSCRTL/DIST = Retailer’s non-labor-scaling costs. 
Incremental markups cover only those costs that scale with a change in the 
manufacturer’s sales price (i.e., NLSC). Incremental markups are coefficients that relate the 
change in the manufacturer sales price of higher-efficiency models to the change in the retailer 
sales price. DOE considers higher-efficiency models to be equipment sold under market 
conditions with new efficiency standards.  It calculated the incremental markup (MUINCR) for 
retailers using the following equation: 
CGS + NLSCRTL / DIST RTL / DISTMU INCR = CGSRTL / DIST 
where: 
MUINCR = Incremental retailer markup, 
CGSRTL/DIST = Retailer’s cost of goods sold, and 
NLSCRTL/DIST = Retailer’s non-labor-scaling costs. 
6.3 MANUFACTURER MARKUPS 
DOE developed an average manufacturer markup by examining the annual Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) 10-K reports filed by four publicly-traded manufacturers primarily 
engaged in appliance manufacturing and whose combined product range includes residential 
refrigeration products.5 The four manufacturers represent a nearly 50 percent market share for 
major appliances.  Because these companies are typically diversified, producing a range of 
different appliances, an industry average markup was assumed by DOE to be representative for 
the manufacture of refrigeration products.  DOE evaluated markups for the years 2002ņ2005. 
Table 6.3.1 lists the average corporate gross margin during the years 2002ņ2005, and 
corresponding markups, for each of the four manufacturers. The average markup value based on 
these four companies is 1.26, which is the value that DOE used.

6.4 RETAILER MARKUP  
DOE used financial data from the U.S. Census Business Expenditure Survey (BES), in 
the “Household Appliance Stores” category, to calculate markups used by retailers that apply to 
residential refrigeration products.c 6  Table 6.4.1 shows the BES data that DOE used and the 
estimated retail markups.

6.5 SALES TAXES 
The sales tax represents state and local sales taxes that are applied to the consumer 
equipment price of the equipment. The sales tax is a multiplicative factor that increases the 
consumer equipment price. 
DOE derived state and local taxes from data provided by the Sales Tax Clearinghouse.7 
DOE derived population-weighted average tax values for each Census division and large state, as 
shown in Table 6.5.1 below. 
Table 6.5.1 Average Sales Tax Rates by Census Division and Large State 
Census Division/State Tax Rate 
New England 4.96%
Mid Atlantic 6.54%
East North Central 6.93%
West North Central 6.77%

Mountain 6.50%
Pacific 5.20% 
New York State 8.25% 
California 9.00%
Texas 8.05%
Florida 6.70%
DOE then derived U.S. average tax values for each product (as shown in Table 6.5.2 
below) based on the product’s saturation within each Census division and large state.  It 
determined the saturations from the DOE Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s 2005 
Residential Energy Consumption Survey.8

CHAPTER 7.  ENERGY USE DETERMINATION  
To perform the life-cycle cost (LCC) and payback period (PBP) calculations described in 
chapter 8, the U.S. Department (DOE) needed to determine the savings in operating cost that 
consumers would derive from more efficient products. DOE uses data on annual energy 
consumption, along with energy prices, to develop the most significant component of consumer 
operating cost. (Maintenance and repair costs are the other components.) This chapter describes 
how DOE determined the annual energy consumption of refrigeration products. 
The engineering analysis described in chapter 5 reports energy use derived from the DOE 
test procedure. This test produces standardized results that can be used o compare the 
performance of different brands of the same product class operating under similar conditions. 
Actual energy usage in the field, however, often differs from that estimated by the test procedure. 
Researchers have conducted studies that measure the field consumption of refrigerator-freezers, 
comparing such measurements to the DOE test results. DOE’s review of several such studies is 
described in appendix 7-A and summarized in section 7.3.9. The review confirmed that energy 
use measured in the field often differs considerably from the usage measured by the DOE test 
procedure. 
To determine the field energy use by products that would meet potential new energy 
efficiency standards, DOE used data from the Energy Information Administration’s 2005 
Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).1 RECS queries a national sample of 
households to collect statistical information on household consumption of and expenditures for 
energy, along with data on energy-related characteristics of the housing units and households. 
RECS provides enough information to establish the type of refrigeration product (the product 
class) used in each household, and provides an estimate of the household energy consumption 
attributable to refrigerators or freezers. As a result, DOE was able to develop a unique household 
sample for most of the representative product classes for standard-size units.  
DOE did not use RECS to evaluate energy consumption by compact refrigerators and
freezers, because many of those products are used outside the residential sector, such as in 
college dormitories, hotels and motels, and offices.  
7.1 HOUSEHOLD SAMPLES FOR REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS
DOE developed household samples for refrigeration products from the 2005 RECS. The 
survey, which sampled 4,382 housing units, was constructed to represent the household 
population throughout the United States. 
RECS results reveal whether a household uses a standard-size refrigerator or freezer. For 
households that have a standard-size refrigerator, RECS specifies whether the freezer is top- or 
bottom-mounted or is side-mounted. Thus units in the sample that have top-mounted freezers 
7-4

cannot be distinguished from those having bottom-mounted freezers (product classes 3 and 5). 
For a household’s primary (or “first”) refrigerator, RECS specifies whether there is through-the-
door ice service. For households that have standard-size freezers, RECS specifies whether the 
unit is upright or a chest-type. With the above data, DOE was able to assign each household 
record to one of the five product classes considered for potential new efficiency standards (Table 
7.1.1).

The relative standard errors associated with the subsamples that contain specific product 
classes are not considered so large as to affect the validity of the derived results presented in this 
chapter. Specifically, the relative standard error of a sample of size N, expressed as a percentage, 
is 100 divided by the square root of (N-1). For the full 2005 RECS sample, the associated 
relative standard error due to sampling is 1.5 percent. For the subsamples containing product 
classes 9 and 10, the associated relative standard errors are 6.4 percent and 5.2 percent, 
respectively. Although the standard error for the smallest subsample is more than four times the 
error for the entire 2005 RECS, it still is less than 10 percent, a relative standard error considered 
small enough to yield meaningful results. Therefore, DOE believes the results generated from the 
household samples for refrigeration products are representative of U.S. households using those 
appliances.

7.2 APPROACH FOR STANDARD-SIZE PRODUCTS 
The Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) reports the annual field energy 
consumption of each household’s refrigeration product(s), a quantity referred to as FECRECS. 
DOE treated the reported energy consumption as the actual consumption of the refrigeration 
product(s) in each household. Because the energy consumed by a household’s refrigerator or 
freezer varies depending on operating conditions, user behavior, and other factors, DOE applied 
a multiplicative usage adjustment factor (UAF) to the labeled energy use of each product to 
reflect those factors. 
To develop a UAF for each RECS household, DOE utilized information that RECS 
provides on the interior volume and age of each refrigeration product. Using this information and 
the unit’s product class, DOE determined for each household unit the maximum allowable tested 
energy consumption, referred to as TECSTD, as stipulated by the energy conservation standard in 
effect at the time the household purchased the product. Because TECSTD differentiates among 
current levels of energy efficiency, it guards against overestimating the energy savings to be 
derived from potential new standards. Using FECRECS and TECSTD, DOE developed the UAF for 
each household to capture the combined effects of consumer behavior (e.g., door openings); 
operating conditions (e.g., room temperature and humidity); and product characteristics (e.g., 
efficiency relative to the maximum allowable). The UAF adjusts the maximum allowable energy 
use when the unit was tested to arrive at the field energy consumption of the refrigeration 
product. UAF is represented by the following expression. 
FECRECSUAF   
TECSTD 
Eq. 7.1
Where: 
UAF = usage adjustment factor; 
FECRECS = refrigeration product’s field energy consumption as reported for the RECS 
household; and 
TECSTD =  maximum allowable tested energy consumption based on the standard in effect at 
the time the household purchased the refrigeration product; for products purchased 
before 1990 (when the first national standard came into effect), DOE used the 
shipments-weighted average energy consumption for that vintage to scale the 
standard. 
DOE was better able to estimate the efficiency of ENERGY STAR products and thus 
develop a UAF that more accurately represents only behavior and operating conditions. DOE 
used an income-based statistical model, described in section 7.3.4, to identify households likely 
to own an ENERGY STAR appliance. In those cases, UAF was defined as follows. 
7-6

  FECRECSUAF  
TECES 
Eq. 7.2
Where: 
UAF = usage adjustment factor, 
FECRECS = refrigeration product’s field energy consumption as reported for the RECS 
household, and 
TECES = tested energy consumption based on the ENERGY STAR criteria in effect at the 
time the household purchased the refrigeration product. 
DOE conducted its analysis with an awareness of proposed revisions to the DOE test 
procedure for refrigerator-freezers, which will stipulate lower temperatures for the fresh food 
compartment and the freezer than those the currently prescribed. DOE has not identified how the 
tested energy consumption under the new procedure will compare to that determined under the 
current procedure. DOE expects this adjustment to take the form of a multiplicative factor 
termed the “efficiency standard adjustment factor,” or ESAF. The ESAF is expected to be 
multiplicative, because the energy use for a refrigeration unit is close to proportional to the 
difference between its interior and exterior temperatures. For the current preliminary analysis, 
DOE assumed that this factor is constant for each product class, and does not vary with product 
efficiency or adjusted volume. See chapter 5 for a complete discussion of the derivation of these 
values. DOE determined the preliminary value of the ESAF for refrigerator-freezers to be: 
x 1.124 for product class 3, 
x 1.18 for product class 5, 
x 1.14 for product class 7, 
x 1.00 for product class 9, and 
x 1.00 for product class 10. 
If the ESAF is multiplicative, it does not affect DOE’s estimate of appliance energy 
consumption by consumers, FEC  The mathematical demonstration of this equivalence is shown 
below, after several additional terms are defined. Fundamentally, the value of the ESAF does not 
affect estimates of field energy use, because changes in the test procedure do not affect consumer 
behavior or operation of an appliance within a household. Field energy consumption of future 
appliances built to meet a national standard, however, may be affected by the test procedure used
to define the standard. For this reason, DOE assumed that the effects of consumer behavior and 
operating conditions, characterized by the UAF, are separate from the effects of the test 
procedure, characterized by the ESAF. DOE therefore separated the UAF values calculated from
the RECS household sample from the ESAF, which does not vary across the household sample. 
If appropriate, DOE will incorporate a more complete and accurate model for the ESAF 
based on ongoing analysis and additional information collected from interested parties. 
Therefore, although a constant, multiplicative ESAF does not affect estimated annual energy use, 
7-7

DOE has chosen to show where the factor would enter into its calculations. To that end, DOE 
defined a new term, TECSTD-REV-TP , which is determined with the following expression. 
TEC   ESAF u TEC  Eq. 7.3STDREV TP  STDEXIST TP 
Where: 
TECSTD-REV-TP =  maximum allowable tested energy consumption based on the standard in 
effect at the time the household purchased the refrigeration product, revised to 
reflect proposed lower temperatures for the fresh food and freezer 
compartments; 
ESAF =  efficiency standard adjustment factor; and 
TECSTD-EXIST-TP =  maximum allowable tested energy consumption based on the standard in 
effect at the time the household purchased the refrigeration product, reflecting 
current DOE test procedure conditions. 
 Substituting TECSTD-REV-TP for TECSTD in Eq. 7.1 produces the following expression for 
UAF. 
FECRECSUAF  
ESAF uTECSTDEXIST TP  Eq. 7.4
After the UAFs were determined for each household within a given sample, DOE 
adjusted the tested energy consumption for a new refrigeration product (TECNEW) (such as those 
analyzed in the engineering analysis) into a field-adjusted annual energy consumption, referred 
to as FECNEW, using the following expression. 
FEC   TEC uUAF Eq. 7.5NEW NEW 
Where: 
FECNEW = field-adjusted annual energy consumption of new refrigeration product, and 
TECNEW = tested energy consumption of new refrigeration product. 
DOE assumed that the UAF a given household would be the same for products that meet 
some future energy efficiency standard as it is for their current appliance. In conducting the life-
cycle cost analysis (chapter 8), DOE substituted the refrigeration product recorded in RECS with 
a new product of identical product class and size that the household is assumed to purchase in the 
year when the new standard goes into effect. 
If the ESAF is a multiplicative factor, as DOE assumed for this analysis, and the energy
use required by the new standard is reduced from the current standard by a factor R (e.g., a 10-

standard, tested under the new test procedure, the field energy consumption is

A multiplicative ESAF therefore is not needed to calculate energy savings related to a 
higher efficiency standard, which can be calculated using only FECRECS and R. 
7.3 USAGE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR STANDARD-SIZE PRODUCTS
This section describes how DOE developed usage adjustment factors (UAFs) from the
data provided for each household in RECS. It also describes how DOE developed minimum and 
maximum UAFs based on the highest and lowest plausible energy consumption of refrigeration 
products in the field. DOE’s methods of acconting for second refrigerators and ENERGY STAR 
products are also described. 
7.3.1 Field Energy Consumption for One or More Refrigerators 
RECS reports the annual energy consumption of each household’s refrigerator(s) or 
freezer in terms of thousands of British thermal units (BTUs) per year, which DOE converted to 
kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year. The reported end-use quantities were not based on data obtained 
by placing meters on individual appliances; rather, a regression technique was used to estimate 
how much of the total annual electricity consumption for each household can be attributed to 
each end-use category.a  The regression equations also were used to infer energy consumption 
when the billing data were missing or inadequate. The refrigerator component for electricity 
consisted of all electricity used to operate refrigerators. The electricity used to operate freezers 
was assigned to a separate component under the category of “general appliance.” 
a The desire to use a large number of independent variables without using a large number of interaction terms and 
the desire to adapt the regression procedures to account for heteroscedastic error terms led to the use of a nonlinear 
regression technique. For more information, see: http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/consumption/residential/append_c.pdf

When a house has two or more refrigerators in RECSb, the energy consumption of all the 
refrigerators is included in the term for “electric refrigerator use.” DOE’s analysis required 
separate consideration of each individual refrigerator in a household.  
Total refrigerator field energy consumption (FEC) for households having two 
refrigerators can be expressed as: 
FEC   (UAF1 uTECSTD1)  ( 
Mon uUAF2 uTECSTD2 ) Eq. 7.712 
Where:  
UAF = usage adjustment factor,  
TEC = test energy consumption, and  
Mon = number of months per year the second refrigerator is on.c  
The subscript numerals 1 and 2 refer to the first and second refrigerator, respectively.    
TECSTD refers to the maximum annual energy consumption allowed by the efficiency 
standards in effect when the product was manufactured. This value depends on the age and 
adjusted volume of the refrigerator. DOE assigned values for the age and adjusted volume of the 
second refrigerator the same way as for the first refrigerator. After these were assigned, the 
TECstd for the second refrigerator was calculated. 
The location of the second refrigerator, often in either a garage or basement, affects its 
UAF. DOE assumed that for most households, the second refrigerator is in the garage. In those 
cases the UAF of the second refrigerator is the same as that of the first. If the second refrigerator 
operates for 12 months of the year, and the house is in the northern part of the country, however, 
the unit was assumed to be in a basement. (North is defined as Census Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4 
plus New York, as well as other areas experiencing at least 5,000 heating degree-days. Because 
the operating environment of a basement on average is colder than that of the first refrigerator, 
DOE estimated the UAF of the second refrigerator to be 70 percent of the UAF of the first. This 
estimate was based on results of a simulation performed under basement conditions versus 
Results from the DOE test procedure. Although DOE did not use RECS to develop a household 
sample for compact refrigerators, DOE included in its analysis of standard-sized products those 
households having a second refrigerator that was a compact. The compact was assigned a 
volume based on the volume distribution in the California Energy Commission appliance 
database,2 and assigned a UAF as if it were standard-sized. 
b Of the households in RECS 2005, 19.6 percent reported having two refrigerators; 1.2 percent reported having
three. DOE considered only those households having one or two refrigerators. 
c RECS reports months of operation for a second refrigerator.

The UAF for each refrigerator can be calculated based on the above assumptions. For 
most households, the UAF for both first and second refrigerators is calculated as:

and the UAF for the second refrigerator is calculated as: 
UAF   0.70 uUAF Eq. 7.102 1 
7.3.2 Tested Energy Consumption 
For each refrigeration unit in a RECS home, the maximum allowable tested energy 
consumption based on the standard in effect at the time the refrigeration product was 
manufactured (TECSTD) depends on the unit’s product class, size, and age (vintage). If the 
household was assigned a refrigerator having an ENERGY STAR designation (using the model 
derived in section 7.3.4), DOE calculated the maximum allowed tested energy consumption for 
an ENERGY STAR unit of the appropriate vintage rather than the maximum allowed by the 
concurrent standard. 
Each unit’s product class was identified as described in section 7.1. The size and vintage 
were determined as described below. 
7.3.2.1 Size
The possible answers to the RECS question regarding the size of the first refrigerator or 
freezer are shown in  Table 7.3.1. The distribution of actual sizes is not uniform within the RECS 
size bins. To estimate the actual size of each unit, DOE estimated the distribution of sizes within 
each bin. To approximate that distribution, DOE used data on refrigerator models from the 2009 
California Energy Commission (CEC) appliance model database.2  The figures in appendix 7-B 
show the number of models by size within each RECS size bin for each considered product 
classes. The size assigned to a sample refrigerator within a RECS size bin was assigned 
randomly using probabilities derived from the CEC data.

The maximum allowed energy consumption depends on the year the product was 
produced, its product class, and adjusted volume. For a refrigerator-freezer, the adjusted volume 
is equal to the internal volume of the fresh food compartment plus 1.63 times the internal volume
of the freezer compartment.3 Using the CEC database,2 DOE used the following linear regression 
to calculate the adjusted volume (Voladj) from the total volume (Voltot):

The dates refrigerator standards took effect do not correspond exactly to the age bins in 
RECS. When the age bin of a refrigerator is insufficient to determine which standard applied, 
DOE chose a year from within the bin to assign as the vintage of that refrigerator. After the year 
was chosen using the survival curve developed for appliance lifetime, the standard appropriate to 
that vintage was applied.
For refrigeration products shipped before 1990, DOE derived an efficiency index based 
on trends in the average unit energy consumption (UEC) for historical shipments of refrigerators 
and freezers. Figure 7.3.1shows the trends in UEC from 1960 to 1990.

There are likely to be fewer of the oldest refrigerators within any vintage bin, both 
because older refrigerators tend be replaced and because fewer refrigerators were produced in 
earlier years. This trend is revealed in Figure 7.3.2, which shows the weighted number of 
households by vintage from the 2005 RECS. For this figure, the refrigerators in each bin were 
assigned equally to each year. A better approach would be to assign more refrigerators to the 
more recent years within each bin by calculating the survival probability [that is, the probability 
of a refrigerator surviving (remaining in use)] for a number of years. The survival probability is 
calculated using the number of refrigerators of each vintage bin reported by RECS as a fraction 
of the number of refrigerators shipped in that range of years. The survival probability accounts 
for the increases in shipments over time, as well as the refrigerators that retire from use. The 
survival probability function used to assign vintages is the same as the lifetime function derived 
for use in the life-cycle cost analysis. The derivation of all parameter values is described in 
chapter 8.

Figure 7.3.4 Survival Probability of Freezers by Age 
A multistep process was followed to assign an age to a given refrigeration product in a 
REC household. First, the product’s age range (based on RECS bin) was compared with the 
Weibull delay parameter. For both refrigerators and freezers, the delay was fixed at 5 years, 
which falls between two RECS age bins. If the age bin contained appliances younger than the 
delay (in years), then an age within the bin was assigned randomly to the product, with no age 
preferred. If the bin contained appliances older (in years) than the delay, a survival value was 
selected randomly from within the range given for the relevant bin. For this purpose, each bin 
was assumed to extend to the beginning of the next bin.  Table 7.3.6 shows the survival values 
assigned to household refrigerators by age bin.

7.3.3 Energy Use of Second Refrigerators 
When a household purchases a new refrigerator, some first units become second units. 
See chapter 8 for a discussion of how DOE modeled the conversion of refrigerators from first to 
second units. A second refrigerator, generally located in a basement or garage, enters a new 
operating environment and may be used less than year-round. For those units that become a 
second refrigerator, therefore, the annual energy consumption changes, presumably remaining at 
the new level for the rest of its lifetime. 
Field energy consumption for the first (FEC1) and second (FEC2) phases of a 
refrigerator’s lifetime can be expressed as: 
FEC1  (UAF1 u TECstd ) Eq. 7.14
MonFEC2   ( uUAF u TECstd) Eq. 7.15

UAF2 = usage adjustment factor for second phase,d 
TEC = test energy consumption, and 
Mon = number of months per year refrigerator is on. 
7.3.4 Estimated Number of ENERGY STAR Refrigerators  
As stated earlier, DOE used Eq. 7.2 to derive the UAF for RECS households likely to 
own an ENERGY STAR appliance. Although RECS 2005 provides information on ownership of 
ENERGY STAR refrigerators purchased between 2001 and 2005, the data seem to greatly 
overestimate the stock of ENERGY STAR refrigerators compared to data regarding shipments 
made during those years. DOE therefore developed a method that predicts ENERGY STAR 
ownership in the RECS sample based on annual average market shares of ENERGY STAR 
refrigerators and on household income. 
DOE based its approach on a study from Natural Resources Canada8 that reported 
ENERGY STAR buyers based on three income categories. DOE assumed that the relative 
behavior of each income category is the same in the United States as for Canadian consumers. 
After matching the three income categories to RECS income bins, DOE assigned a probability of 
owning an ENERGY STAR unit to each household record as a function of its income. This 
probability was then scaled to reflect income levels in the RECS sample and national ENERGY 
STAR sales. The following equation was used. 
Estaryear   scaleyear u (Flow u P _ Estarlow  Fmid u P _ Estarmid  Fhigh u P _ Estarhigh) Eq. 7.16
Where: 
Estaryear  = percent of annual national refrigerator sales that were ENERGY STAR 
qualified;
Flow|mid|high = percent of weighted number of RECS 2005 households in low, medium, 
and high income bins;  
P_Estar low|mid|high = probability of households in an income bin buying an ENERGY STAR 
appliance; and 
scaleyear = scaling factor to obtain the appropriate percent of ENERGY STAR 
refrigerators for each vintage. 
Table 7.3.7 shows the market shares of ENERGY STAR refrigerators (Estaryear), which 
were obtained from the ENERGY STAR program.9 The market shares of ENERGY STAR 
freezers are estimates.   
d This UAF accounts for the changed operating environment during the second phase.

The scaling factor for each year was calculated as: 
Estaryearscaleyear   Eq. 7.17(FlowuP_ EstarlowFmiduP_ EstarmidFhighuP_Estarhigh) 
A household in the low-income bin that purchased a refrigerator in a given year was a 
assigned a probability Scaleyear times P_Estar low for having an ENERGY STAR refrigerator. A 
similar approach was taken for households in the mid- and-high income bins. 
7.3.5 Validating Field Energy Consumption 
The values for refrigerator energy consumption reported in RECS 2005 ranged from 6 
kWh to more than 10,000 kWh for households having one refrigerator. DOE developed an 
approach that utilized the UAFs calculated for each household to confirm whether the reported 
values for refrigerators (and freezers) were reasonable. This approach required calculating 
maximum and minimum plausible UAFs for various refrigeration products. 
A range of possible UAFs can apply to a given refrigerator, based on the range of 
possible refrigerator sizes and ages consistent with the household’s RECS response. If the range 
of UAFs for a given household was entirely outside the boundaries of what DOE considered to 
be plausible, DOE excluded the household from the LCC analysis. Such outliers occur if the 
maximum possible UAF for a record is lower than the minimum plausible UAF or if the 
minimum UAF is higher than the maximum plausible UAF. 
If the range of UAFs for a given household intersected the range of plausible UAFs, the 
UAFs outside the boundaries were brought to the minimum or maximum plausible value. Thus, a 
household was not excluded from the sample if it had a plausible UAF. 
7.3.6 Maximum Usage Adjustment Factor 
To evaluate the maximum plausible UAF, DOE estimated the maximum plausible energy 
consumption of a refrigerator if it were running continuously. DOE’s calculation of the 
maximum electricity consumption assumes that the compressor runs constantly, comparable to 
leaving the door open 24 hours a day for 365 days a year. The evaporator and condenser fans, the 
interior lights, and the gasket heater (found only on refrigerators built before 1993) also were 
assumed to run continuously. DOE assumed that both the refrigerator and freezer compartment 
have a 20-W light bulb. The defrost cycle is often initiated based on the compressor run time.

DOE assumed the defrost cycle runs for 10 minutes every 10 hours, which is the default input to 
the EPA’s refrigerator analysis (ERA) model.10 
Table 7.3.8 shows the power consumption and times DOE estimated for various 
components of each cycle for the ice maker. In real-world operation the compressor must run 
longer than indicated in Table 7.3.8 in order to extract the heat from the ice maker components, 
along with the latent heat of freezing from freezing water to make ice. To calculate the maximum 
theoretical electricity consumption, DOE assumed that the compressor already runs 
continuously, so there is no additional compressor run time. The components consume a total of 
6.3 Watt-hours per ice-making cycle.11 The value used for maximum ice-making cycles per day 
was nine.12

Where: 
WComp = the power (in Watts) used by the compressor; 
WFans = the power (in Watts) used by the fans;  
WLights = the power (in Watts) used by the light; 
WGasket = the power (in Watts) used by the gasket heater; 
WDefrost = the power (in Watts) used by the defrost cycle, which is active 1.7 percent of 
the time
kWhIce = the energy (in kWh) used to complete nine ice-making cycles per day 
(including mold heater, solenoid, and ejector) in one year; 
TECSTD-EXIST-TP  = the test energy consumption; and  
ESAF = the efficiency standard adjustment factor.  
DOE collected the wattage for most components for the baseline models in several 
product classes from the Technical Support Documents (TSDs) developed in the analyses 
leading to the 2001 standard, the July 1995 notice of proposed rulemaking,13 and the November 
1989 final rule.14 The earlier TSDs (March 198215 and June 198016) did not report baseline 
energy use for the compressor. The documents, however, do report the amount of time the

refrigerator was running during the test procedure. DOE calculated the maximum plausible 
annual energy consumption by (1) increasing the test procedure output to what it would be if the 
refrigerator were running continuously and (2) adding a continuously burning 40-W light bulb.  
The equation given above was used to calculate the maximum theoretical UEC and UAF 
for each baseline model in the TSDs. The theoretical maximum UAFs based on past TSDs for all 
of the analyzed product classes are shown in Tables 7.3.9 through 7.3.13.

The maximum annual energy consumption allowed by a given standard scales linearly 
with volume. DOE assumed that in the extreme case used to determine the maximum plausible 
energy consumption, annual energy consumption also scales linearly with volume. Therefore, the 
maximum theoretically possible UAF is constant for each production year and product class, 
regardless of volume. 
Older refrigerators generally had low maximum plausible UAFs. As the minimum 
efficiency allowed by standards increased, compartments became better insulated and the 
refrigeration cycle more efficient. The compressor therefore uses less energy to maintain 
conditions inside the cabinet and so runs for less time. Ordinary test procedure operation thus 
represents a smaller and smaller fraction of the extreme, all-out energy consumption used in the 
calculations described in this section. Thus, the test procedure energy use (TEC) for older 
refrigerators is closer to their maximum theoretically possible field energy consumption than it is 
for newer refrigerators.  
The maximum theoretically possible UAF (MaxUAF) scales linearly with age, as shown 
in Figure 7.3.5.

DOE performed a linear regression to fit MaxUAF by vintage, thus providing a value of 
MaxUAF for a unit of any age. Table 7.3.14 shows the intercept and slope of the regression line 
for MaxUAF for each product class. The quality of the linear fit from the regression for each 
product class is shown by the R2 value.

DOE compared the MaxUAF value to the smallest possible UAF for the refrigerator for 
each RECS record to determine whether the household’s refrigerator energy use was plausible 
and the RECS record should be retained in the analysis. 
7.3.7 Minimum Usage Adjustment Factor 
To estimate the least plausible UAF, DOE used EPA’s refrigerator analysis (ERA) 
model.10 DOE used the default models in ERA for product classes 3 and 10. Values for the other 
product classes were derived from the default models for those product classes. DOE assumed 
that product classes 3 and 5 have identical minimum UAFs.   
For each year a TSD was published, DOE modified the ERA input file to better match the 
characteristics of the baseline model described in the TSD. Then the ERA model was run under 
test procedure conditions and under very favorable conditions (such as in an air-conditioned 
kitchen or a basement). The temperature settings for the compartments were assumed to be the 
maximum allowed by the ERA model. DOE also assumed that any gasket heater was turned off. 
Tables 7.3.15 and 7.3.16 show the temperature settings used to model both these “ideal” 
conditions and test conditions.

In order to validate the model, DOE compared the ERA simulation model under test 
procedure conditions to the results of the test procedure reported in each TSD. In addition to the 
temperatures listed in Tables 7.3.15 and 7.3.16, the other control settings during the test were: 
x Defrost controls were not operative during the test procedure.
x Anti-sweat heater switch was set to the position that consumes the maximum energy. 
The 1995 TSD also mentions a correction factor to adjust the ERA model results based 
on the tested consumption. Correction factors for DOE’s modeling for this analysis, as well as 
the values cited in the 1995 TSD, are listed in Table 7.3.17. If the error percentage is greater than 
0, it means that the ERA model overestimated the energy use in the test procedure, and the value 
of CAL in Eq. 7.19 is greater than 1.

The simulation models produced the same range of error as those specified in the 1995 
TSD. When calculating the minimum UAF, this calibration factor cancels out, as shown in the 
following equation, because the ERA model also over-estimates the energy use in the ideal 
conditions by the same factor. DOE defined the minimum plausible UAF as:

Where: 
FECIdeal_ERA = minimum field energy consumption modeled in ERA under ideal conditions,

DOE assumed that minimum UAFs are constant across volumes, that bottom-mount and 
top-mount products have the same minimum UAF, and that through-the-door ice service does 
not affect the minimum UAF. 
7.3.8 Results by Product Class 
Figures 7.3.7 through 7.3.16 show the distribution of UAFs for the RECS households in 
the subsample that represents each standard-sized product class. Each figure shows the 
distribution of UAFs before and after the truncation produced by applying the minimum and 
maximum UAFs. The distribution used for LCC analysis is the distribution after removing 
households having implausible UAFs.

Figure 7.3.16 Final UAF Distribution for Standard-Size Chest Freezers  
(Product Class 10)  
The maximum plausible UAF limits the freezer sample more than the refrigerator-freezer 
sample. The maximum is more restrictive for freezers because their compressors are assumed to 
run more than 80 percent of the time in normal operation, as opposed to 52 percent to 65 percent 
of the time for refrigerators. As a result, increasing appliance energy use to its theoretical 
maximum, to reflect a compressor that runs 100 percent of the time, has a smaller effect for 
freezers. RECS also has a simpler model for estimating household energy use for freezers than it 
does for refrigerator-freezers, which may contribute to the wide range of energy consumption 
assigned to freezers across the household sample. The minimum and maximum UAF thresholds 
enabled DOE to remove from the sample households having unrealistic freezer energy
consumption.

7.3.9 Distributions: Comparison with Other Studies 
The variation in UAFs within the national RECS sample has several causes, including
indoor temperature, appliance age, and varying usage patterns. Meier et al.17 and Miller and 
Pratt18 indicate that refrigerator energy use varies significantly in response to ambient 
temperature, which implies that climate contributes to variation in household energy use. In 
addition, refrigerators generally use more energy as they age, 19 and the RECS sample includes 
appliances having a wide range of ages. Household choices regarding the frequency of door 
opening and how often and how much warm food is loaded into the unit, along with the ambient 
temperature in the kitchen, likely add to variability. In addition, the DOE test procedure does not 
measure energy consumed by ice making, so it is not reflected in the labeled energy 
consumption. The presence or absence of an automatic ice maker, as well as variation in the 
amount of ice made, also contribute to the variation in UAF within and between product classes. 
In addition to their significant width, the UAF distributions shown in Figures 7.3.7 
through 7.3.16 do not have a mean value of 1, indicating that the average energy use for a 
refrigerator drawn from the American residential stock differs from the labeled energy use of that 
same refrigerator when it was new. This result is consistent with reports in the literature. A full 
literature survey, available in appendix 7-A, is summarized here. Refrigerator energy use may be 
characterized by three measures: 
(A) the label on the product when new, derived from the DOE test procedure;  
7-36 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(B) the results of the DOE test procedure on a particular appliance after it has been used 
in the field; and 
(C) the in situ (ideally directly measured) energy consumption in a user’s home.  
The UAF for a given refrigerator is the ratio of (C) to (A). Studies described in the 
literature examined two classes of refrigerators: new or likely new (installed in new homes), for 
which the usual comparison is (C) to (A); and recycled/disposed refrigerators, for which all 
possible pairs of measures have been compared. 
Studies of new (or likely new) refrigerators in consumers’ homes reveal a wide variation 
in energy use among consumers. The mean energy consumption cited in those studies lies within 
40 percent of the appliance label.20 The literature indicates that refrigerators in cooler climates 
tend to use less energy than their labeled energy consumption,19 whereas those in warmer 
locations tend to use more energy than labeled. This difference contributes to the width of the 
national UAF distributions. 
Studies of non-new refrigerators generally examine refrigerators collected as part of early 
replacement programs operated by electric utilities. Such studies are used to measure the effect 
of the utility program and to obtain credit for the energy reductions resulting from replacing old 
appliances. The non-new refrigerators described in the literature, which must be in use by their 
owners, commonly are relatively old. Measurements, both in situ and from the DOE test 
procedure, show these refrigerators use significantly more energy than the labeled consumption. 
KEMA21 used the DOE procedure to test 136 such refrigerators. This comparison of (B) to (A) 
isolates the effect of age from those of user behavior or environment. KEMA found that the 
median increase in energy consumption relative to labeled use was 46 percent, and that roughly 
15 percent of the sample used more than twice the labeled energy. Only 7 percent of the sample 
used less than labeled. When Peterson et al.22 combined the data from several studies (of a total 
of 193 recycled refrigerators), they found that the average increase in energy consumption, as 
measured by the DOE test procedure, was 50 percent, with 25 percent of refrigerators using more 
than 1.7 times their labeled energy. Miller and Pratt18 performed a regression analysis on in-use 
refrigerators in New York public housing [a (C) to (A) comparison], deducing an average 1.4-
percent increase in energy use per year. These studies indicate that the UAF distribution for old 
refrigerators is expected to be wide and to have a mean significantly higher than 1. 
Several aspects of in-use refrigerator operation are not reflected in the DOE test 
procedure and therefore affect the UAF. In particular, the DOE test does not measure the energy 
used by ice makers. Estimates of the effect of this omission range from 5 percent to 26 percent,11 
with a rough estimate of 10 percent being common and consistent with published direct 
measurements. Through-the-door (TTD) ice making may consume more energy than non-TTD 
ice making. DOE therefore expects the UAF distribution from product classes that include TTD 
ice makers to have a somewhat higher mean than classes that do not. The size of the difference 
depends on the fraction of non-TTD refrigerators that use ice makers, and the possible difference 
in ice-making behavior among users of various product classes. Meier and Martinez11 also report 
that ice-making energy may increase over time, compounding the increased energy use with age. 
7-37

A national sample of refrigerators, such as RECS, covers refrigerators in various climate 
zones and of various ages. As such, DOE expects those two factors (as well as behavioral 
differences among users) to produce significant scatter in the UAF. If new refrigerators use 
energy at close to their labeled rate as determined by the DOE test, and refrigerators at retirement 
use significantly more energy when tested using the same procedure, the national mean UAF is 
expected to be greater than 1. DOE could not conclude from the literature that a particular value 
or distribution should be assigned to the UAF, Therefore, DOE cannot justify further adjusting 
the UAF distribution derived from RECS. 
7.4 ENERGY USE OF COMPACT REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, compact refrigerators and freezers are 
used in homes, college dormitories, hotels and motels, and some commercial buildings. DOE 
found no data on the typical field energy consumption of compact refrigeration products. It 
therefore assumed that the average field energy use of compact refrigerators and freezers of a 
given size is the same as the maximum energy use allowed by the DOE standard, as measured in 
the DOE test procedure. In effect, DOE assumed that variation in field energy use of compact 
products is a function solely of volume. To represent the distribution of volumes in the field, 
DOE used data from the 2008 CEC appliance model database.2  Figures in appendix 7-B show 
the distribution of appliance sizes represented within the database. 
DOE used the CEC database to develop a linear equation relating listed total volume to 
adjusted volume for product class 11. The parameters of the equation are listed in  Table 7.4.1. 
For compact freezers, the adjusted volume is equal to 1.73 times the volume.3 DOE then used the 
relation between adjusted volume and energy use described by the DOE test procedure to relate 
the distribution of volumes in the CEC database to a distribution of energy use values.

7.5 ANNUAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY EFFICIENCY LEVEL 
This section reports the annual field energy consumption calculated for refrigeration 
products that meet new efficiency standards if they were used in RECS 2005 homes. As 
described in section 7.2, DOE calculated field-adjusted annual energy consumption for each 
home’s refrigeration product by multiplying the tested energy consumption of a new 
refrigeration product, measured using the existing test procedures, by the efficiency standard 
adjustment factor (ESAF), which is a constant for each product class, and by the UAF for that 
household.

As discussed in chapter 5, DOE analyzed specific efficiency levels for the considered
product classes. Tables 7.5.1 through 7.5.6 show the considered efficiency levels and 
corresponding annual energy consumption for each product class. The tables for standard-sized 
products show the average annual energy consumption according to the proposed DOE test 
procedure (“proposed test”) and in the average energy use based on the corresponding RECS 
2005 household subsamples (“field”). The tables for compact appliances (product classes 11 and 
18) show the average annual energy consumption according to the proposed DOE test procedure, 
using a distribution of product volumes based on the CEC appliance database.

APPENDIX 7-A. LITERATURE SURVEY OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY  
RESIDENTIAL REFRIGERATOR-FREEZERS  
7-A.1 INTRODUCTION 
Efficient refrigerator-freezers reduce peak energy consumption as well as total household 
energy use. As a result, electric utilities regard replacement programs for these appliances as an 
attractive and effective way to reduce residential energy consumption. To estimate the amount of 
electricity savings attributable to an energy-efficient refrigerator-freezer program, utilities must 
evaluate the difference between the pre- and post-program energy consumption of the appliance 
stock. The challenge to accurately estimate the electricity savings of a refrigerator-freezer 
replacement program lies in estimating the real-life consumption of the original and replacement 
units. 
Estimation of appliance energy consumption may be undertaken in three ways, all of 
which are represented in the literature: 
A) The labeled energy consumption on a new appliance, based on the U.S. Department 
of Energy (DOE) test procedure undertaken on a sample of several identical 
appliances, and reported by the appliance manufacturer 
B) The DOE test procedure applied to a particular appliance (often not a new appliance), 
and 
C) Measurement for some period of time in situ in a household. 
Most studies compare two of these measurements in order to evaluate energy use.  For example, 
a study might compare the results of the DOE test procedure on an old refrigerator with the 
labeled energy consumption when new to isolate the effect of appliance age, while eliminating 
possible effects due to user behavior. This appendix refers to such a study as comparing (B) to 
(A). 
Researchers have conducted studies that measure the field consumption of refrigerator-
freezers to compare in situ measurements to the DOE test results, represented either by the 
labeled results ((C) to (A)), or through direct testing under DOE conditions ((C) to (B)). When 
such field studies are evaluated, the lack of consistency among study conditions (such as 
geographic location, housing type, and the number and type of units), limited time of direct 
measurements, and the degradation of efficiency throughout the lifetime of a refrigerator-freezer 
contribute to the challenge of estimating potential energy consumption savings from new units. 
This appendix summarizes available literature regarding the comparison of different 
measurement methods for refrigerator-freezers in order to evaluate reasonable possible values for 
the ‘usage adjustment factor’ (UAF), which is an estimate of the ratio of (C) to (A). There are 
very few published measurements of freezers or compact appliances, so DOE addresses only 
refrigerator-freezers in this summary. Section 2 summarizes the DOE test procedure and lists and
characterizes the field studies which DOE used in its analyses. Section 3 discusses these studies 
and their implications for the UAF parameter used in Chapter 6, particularly regarding variation 
with season and climate, and efficiency degradation with unit age.

7-A.2 TEST PROCEDURE AND FIELD STUDIES 
This section describes the DOE test procedure, then lists field studies of energy 
consumption by refrigerator-freezers and distills their results.
7A.2.1 DOE Test Procedure 
“The DOE test is a compromise between realism and minimizing the costs of performing 
a reliable, repeatable laboratory test” (Meier, 1993). The DOE procedure for evaluating the 
annual energy consumption of refrigerator-freezers comprises the following features (10 CFR, 
Chapter II, Part 430, Appendix A1). 
•  The standard test temperature for the fresh food compartment is 45°F. 
•  The standard test temperature for the freezer compartment is 5°F. 
•  The test is performed in a chamber that is maintained at an ambient temperature of 90°F. 
•  The temperatures of the freezer and fresh food compartments are measured using three 
independent thermocouples, one for each compartment. Five thermocouples are used 
when the refrigerator height is over 40”. 
•  The appliance’s energy consumption is calculated by interpolating test results that
bracket the standard freezer temperature (5°F). Interpolation is done around the 5°F 
temperature (freezer compartment) and the 45°F temperature (fresh food compartment). 
•  Ambient relative humidity is not specified. 
•  Doors are not opened during the test. 
•  The fresh food and freezer compartments are empty. 
•  Ice making capability, if present, is not powered on or evaluated by the test. 
The DOE test procedure is currently undergoing a rulemaking process which may change 
some of the above details. In particular, changes have been proposed to the test temperatures for 
the refrigerator and freezer compartments. 
The DOE test procedure does not measure the effects of door opening, cooling warm
food, or ice making. However, this test procedure provides standardized results that can serve as 
the basis for comparing the performance of appliances. Although the DOE test does not precisely 
mirror any single unit’s performance in situ, it serves as a foundation to which field 
measurements may be compared to develop estimates that account for a range of real-life 
circumstances (KEMA, 2004). 
A summary of new refrigerator-freezer unit energy consumption values provided by 
manufacturers by year shows the annual variation of shipment-weighted refrigerator energy 
consumption from 1960s to the year 2006 (Table 2.1). These data are based on “nameplate” 
values. For the model years before the DOE energy standards (1989 and earlier), the test 
conditions are unknown in which energy consumption quantities were measured, although it is 
likely that manufacturers used the American Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) test 
procedure or the test procedure prescribed by California state energy conservation standards.

7A.2.2 Field Studies 
 In situ conditions account for several important factors including: ambient air 
temperature; the number and duration of door openings; the temperature of food loaded into the 
unit; the placement of the unit in relation to walls, ovens, and stoves; the temperature setting in 
the field; and the ice maker setting in the field. 
Since the early 1980s, utilities and government agencies have collected data on field-
measured refrigerator-freezer energy consumption in order to evaluate the effects of refrigerator 
“early replacement” programs. The collected data varies tremendously by sample size, the type 
of refrigerator-freezer studied, the length of time each appliance was monitored, and their 
operating conditions. The studies summarized in Table 2.2 describe the performance of 
refrigerator-freezers as measured in various ways.  
7A.2.2.1 KEMA-Xenergy Findings 
The private consulting firm KEMA-Xenergy in 2002 reviewed numerous reports of in 
situ performance studies for Southern California Edison. Several reports were summarized by 
KEMA-Xenergy but are not available to be reviewed by DOE. These reports are indicated by a 
“#” in Table 2.2.

7-A.3 LITERATURE ANALYSIS 
DOE’s interest in surveying the refrigerator-freezer energy use literature is to evaluate the 
range of possible appropriate values for the ‘usage adjustment factor’, or UAF. The UAF is a 
“(C) to (A)”-type measurement, relating energy use in situ to the DOE test result for a new 
appliance.  
Studies of new appliances include Meier & Jansky (1993), Meier et al. (1993), Dutt et al. 
(1994), Quantum (1994), Goett (1995), Miller & Pratt (1998), and Kinney & Belshe (2001). The 
average (or typical) values of the ratio of (C) to (A) for these studies range from 0.85 to 1.1, and 
there is significant variation, with ratios ranging from 0.56 to 1.25. The majority of these studies 
are not adjusted for ambient temperature variations or climate (although several use year-long 
samples to eliminate seasonal effects). The only of these studies which is adjusted (Dutt et al.) is 
normalized to the climate of the particular location of the measurements, rather than to a national 
average climate model. Taken collectively, these studies do not allow DOE to draw conclusions 
regarding possible national variation in new-refrigerator energy use, particularly due to 
variations in climate. They do indicate that the labeled energy consumption of a new appliance is 
likely to be accurate in situ to within 40%, as suggested by Meier (1995). 
Studies of refrigerators at the time of replacement by utility programs show higher energy 
use relative to the labeled energy consumption than do new refrigerators. For older refrigerators, 
studies predominantly take two forms: (B) to (A) or (C) to (A).  (B) to (A) studies isolate the 
effects of age from any other effects (such as behavior or ambient temperature in situ), while (C) 
to (A) studies give a direct indication of the ‘UAF’ of old appliances. These studies are not 
necessarily representative of all older refrigerators, because they study only those units and 
households participating in utility refrigerator recycling programs. 
 Test-procedure-only comparison studies include Bos (1993), Barakat & Chamberlin 
(1996), KEMA (2004) and Peterson et al. (2007).  All four of these studies show significant 
energy use increase in the DOE test procedure; KEMA and Peterson both indicate an energy use 
increase of close to 50%, with wide variation. Only 7% of the refrigerators measured by KEMA 
used less than their labeled consumption. 25% of the refrigerators measured by Peterson et al. 
used more than 70% more that their labeled consumption. 
Miller & Pratt (1998), Kinney & Belshe (2001), and Mowris (2003) undertook direct 
evaluation of the ratio of in situ to labeled consumption for older refrigerators. The average ratio 
in all three studies was measured to be larger than one, although smaller than the test-procedure-
based comparisons. Mowris indicated wide variation in energy use relative to the label, and 
Miller & Pratt’s sub-categories show a range of energy consumptions from 28% below the label 
to 20% above. 
Only one study reviewed by DOE compared in situ energy use to the DOE test on the 
same appliance (ADM, Athens, et al., 2008), a (C) to (B) comparison. Depending on the weather 
7-A-5

model used to adjust the in situ measurements, they found that on average the DOE test 
procedure overestimated the in situ use by 13 to 23%. This study does not include an indication 
of how the DOE test consumption compared with the labeled consumption. 
Testing has confirmed that age, in combination with other refrigerator characteristics,
accounts for the degradation of refrigerator energy efficiency (KEMA, 2004; Peterson, 2007). 
Therefore, energy efficiency degradation is a factor in calculating the savings between new and 
replacement units. Energy use increases when barriers to cabinet air and heat leakage degrade. 
For example, door seals no longer close tightly, damaged walls allow air flow, and wet or 
degraded insulation no longer performs its function. 
Two studies (KEMA, 2004 and Miller & Pratt, 1998) used regression analysis to measure 
the average effect of annual degradation on appliance energy use. KEMA determined an energy 
use growth rate of roughly 40 kWh/year, depending on model characteristics. Miller & Pratt’s 
regression model predicts a 1.37% increase in energy use each year. Smit (2006) reports that 
Athens (1998) calculated a degradation rate of 0.6% per year. 
7-A.4 SUMMARY 
This appendix summarizes current literature pertaining to the difference between DOE-
test based measurements (when new or at retirement) and field-based measurements of 
refrigerator-freezer energy consumption. In situ energy use was found to be close to labeled 
consumption for new refrigerators, but higher than labeled at the time of replacement. This 
appendix has examined the mean values and variability from the literature; the variability across 
a national sample is likely much greater than the range addressed here. 
Degradation of the refrigerator unit contributes to the discrepancy between the DOE test 
and field measured energy consumption data.  However, the precise rate of efficiency decrease 
(and particularly its variability) cannot be determined from the literature.

APPENDIX 7-B.  DATA FOR ESTIMATING DISTRIBUTION OF REFRIGERATOR  
AND FREEZER SIZE IN THE RECS SAMPLE
7-B.1 INTRODUCTION 
DOE used the California Energy Commission (CEC) appliance database1 to determine 
the distribution of refrigerator and freezer volumes in the market. The Energy Information 
Administration’s (EIA) Residential Energy Consumption Surveys (RECS)2 provides the volumes 
of household refrigerators only within bins (ranges). In order to estimate the labeled energy 
consumption of a household’s standard-sized appliance, DOE selected a volume from within the 
appropriate RECS bin. DOE then selected a more precise volume randomly from the distribution 
of volumes within the RECS bin, basing the probability of selecting each volume on the number 
of models in the CEC database having that volume. The figures in this appendix show the 
volume distributions by number of models in the CEC database (narrower, solid bars in figures) 
and the distributions of refrigerator volumes reported by RECS respondents (wider, empty bars 
in figures). For each standard-sized refrigeration product DOE first identified the appropriate 
RECS bin and product class, then chose a more precise volume from the relevant part of the CEC 
distribution. 
For compact products (product classes 11 and 18), for which DOE did not use a 
household sample, DOE used the distribution of volumes from the CEC database to characterize 
the distribution of volumes sold in the market and determine the distribution of energy use. 
7-B.2 RESULTS
Figures 7-B.2.1 through 7-B.2.7 depict the volume distributions on the number of models 
in the CEC database and the distribution of refrigerator and freezer volumes reported in RECS.

CHAPTER 8.  LIFE-CYCLE COST AND PAYBACK PERIOD ANALYSIS 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
This chapter describes the Department of Energy (DOE)’s method and metrics for 
analyzing the economic impacts on individual consumers of potential energy efficiency 
standards for refrigeration products. The effects of standards on individual consumers include a 
change (usually a decrease) in operating cost and a change (usually an increase) in product cost. 
DOE analyzed the economic impacts related to potential new energy efficiency standards for 
standard­size refrigerator­freezers (top­mount, bottom­mount, and side­by­side); standard­size 
freezers (upright and chest); and compact refrigeration products (refrigerators and freezers), a 
total of 7 product classes. DOE examined the life­cycle cost, payback period, and rebuttable 
payback period of all potential efficiency standards on all product classes. The terms used in this 
analysis are defined below. 
x  Life-cycle cost (LCC) is the total cost consumers incur during the life of an appliance, 
including purchase and operating costs (including energy expenditures). DOE 
discounts future operating costs to the time of purchase, and sums them over the 
lifetime of a product. 
x  Payback period (PBP) measures the amount of time it takes consumers to recover the 
assumed higher purchase cost of more energy efficient products through lower 
operating costs. 
x  Rebuttable payback period, a special case of the payback period, is based on 
laboratory conditions (specifically, those that reflect the DOE test procedure) for 
energy use. Its other inputs (including electricity prices) reflect representative real­
world operating conditions. 
Inputs to the LCC and the PBP are discussed in sections 8.2 and 8.3, respectively, of this 
chapter. Results of the LCC and PBP analyses are presented in section 8.4. The rebuttable PBP is 
discussed in section 8.5. Key variables and calculations are presented for each of the three 
metrics listed above. DOE performed the calculations discussed here using a series of Microsoft 
Excel spreadsheets that are accessible on the Internet 
(www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/). Details regarding and instructions for 
using the spreadsheets are discussed in appendix 8­A.   
8.1.1 Approach 
Recognizing that several inputs to the analysis of consumer LCC and PBP are either 
variable or uncertain, DOE used Monte Carlo simulation and probability distributions to model 
both the uncertainty and variability of inputs. Appendix 8­B provides a detailed explanation of 
Monte Carlo simulation and the use of probability distributions. DOE developed LCC and PBP 
spreadsheet models that incorporate both Monte Carlo simulation and probability distributions 
8­1

by using Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets combined with Crystal Ball®, a commercially available 
add­in program.
In addition to using probability distributions to characterize several of the inputs to the 
calculation, DOE developed samples of individual households that use standard­size 
refrigeration products. DOE performed the LCC and PBP calculations for each household in the 
sample to account for the variability in energy consumption and/or energy price associated with a 
range of households. 
As described in chapter 7, DOE used the DOE Energy Information Administration 
(EIA)’s 2005 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) to develop household samples 
for standard­size refrigeration products.1 EIA constructed the 2005 RECS to represent the range 
of households throughout the United States. 
DOE used the 2005 RECS to establish the variability in the annual energy use of 
refrigeration products and in energy prices. DOE was able to assign a unique annual energy use 
and/or energy price to each household in the sample. Because of the large sample of households 
considered in the LCC and PBP analyses, annual energy use and/or energy prices vary greatly. 
Thus, although the annual energy use and/or energy prices are known for any particular 
household, their variability across all households contributes to the range of LCCs and PBPs 
calculated for any particular possible standard. 
DOE did not develop a household sample for compact refrigeration products, because 
many such products are used in lodging, dormitories, and other commercial establishments. DOE 
estimated the fractions of shipments of compact refrigeration products used in the residential and 
commercial sectors, then used appropriate inputs for those fractions. 
DOE displays LCC and PBP results as distributions of impacts compared to baseline 
conditions. Results, presented in section 8.4, were derived from 10,000 samples for each Monte 
Carlo simulation run. To illustrate the implications of the analysis, DOE generated a frequency 
chart that depicts the variation in LCC and PBP for each standard level considered for 
refrigeration products. 
8.1.2 Summary of Inputs 
The LCC represents the total consumer cost during the life of a product, including 
purchase and operating costs (including energy expenditures). DOE discounts future operating 
cost to the time of purchase, then sums them over the lifetime of each product. The PBP is the 
change in purchase cost due to an increased efficiency standard divided by the change in annual 
operating cost that results from the standard. The PBP represents the number of years it will take 
the customer to recover the increased purchase cost through decreased operating cost.   
DOE uses two types of inputs to the calculation of LCC and PBP: (1) inputs for 
establishing the purchase cost, otherwise known as the consumer product cost, and (2) inputs for 
determining the operating cost.

The following are the primary inputs for establishing the consumer product cost. 
x  Baseline selling price: The price at which a manufacturer sells a product identified as 
a baseline­efficient model.  
x  Increases in manufacturer selling price (MSP): The change in manufacturer selling 
price associated with producing a product that meets a particular efficiency level. 
x  Markups and sales tax: The costs associated with converting increases in the MSP 
into consumer product cost.   
The following are the primary inputs for calculating the operating cost. 
x  Product energy consumption: The site energy use associated with operating a given 
product. 
x  Product efficiency: The energy consumption associated with a product that has an 
efficiency greater than that of the baseline product.   
x  Energy prices: The prices consumers paid for energy (electricity) in a recent year. 
x  Energy price trends. Energy prices forecasted into the future. DOE based these trends 
on the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2009.2 
x  Repair and maintenance costs: Repair costs are associated with repairing or replacing 
components that fail. Maintenance costs are associated with maintaining the operation 
of a product. 
x  Lifetime: The age at which a product is retired from service.  
x  Discount rate: The rate at which DOE discounted future expenditures to establish 
their present value.

operating cost used to calculate the LCC and PBP. The yellow boxes in Figure 8.1.1 indicate 
inputs; the green boxes indicate intermediate outputs; and the blue boxes indicate the final 
outputs of LCC and PBP.

8.2 INPUTS TO LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS 
Life­cycle cost (LCC) is the total consumer cost during the life of an appliance, including 
purchase and operating costs (including energy costs). DOE discounted future operating costs to 
the time of purchase, then summed them over the lifetime of the product. DOE used the 
following equation to define LCC. 
LCC   PC ¦ N OCt t1 r 
Where: 
t 1 
LCC =  life­cycle cost in dollars; 
PC =  consumer product cost in dollars; 
 =  sum over the lifetime, from year 1 to year N; 
N =  lifetime of appliance in years; 
OC = operating cost in dollars;

r =  discount rate; and  
t =  year for which operating cost is being determined.  
DOE expresses dollar values in 2008$ because it gathered most of its data for the LCC and PBP  
analysis in 2008.  
8.2.1 Inputs to Product Cost 
DOE calculated the cost consumers pay for baseline products based on the following 
equation. 
PC   (RSP )u (TAX )BASE BASE 
Where: 
PCBASE =  consumer cost for baseline product, 
RSPBASE =  retail selling price for baseline product, and 
TAX= sales tax. 
DOE calculated the consumer cost for products having higher efficiency levels based on the 
following equation. 
PCSTD   PCBASE  ('MSPSTD u MU uTAX )RETINCR 
Where:  
PCSTD =  consumer product cost for higher­efficiency products,  
PCBASE =  consumer cost for baseline product
ǻMSPSTD =  change in MSP for more efficient model,  
MURET_INCR =  incremental retailer markup,  
TAX= sales tax.  
8.2.1.1 Baseline Retail Prices 
DOE’s engineering analysis (see chapter 5) did not attempt to estimate the manufacturing 
sales price (MSP) for baseline models. Instead, it developed incremental increases in MSP 
associated with increases in efficiency level. This approach required DOE to estimate retail 
prices for the baseline model in each product class.  
DOE drew upon proprietary retail price data collected by The NPD Group.3 These data 
reflect prices and sales at many retail outlets in the United States, representing more than 50 
percent of retail sales nationwide. The data include model number, refrigerated volume, 
configuration of doors and ice­making, and whether the unit is an ENERGY STAR product. 
Based on these data DOE developed a sales­weighted price distribution for non­ENERGY STAR 
8­8  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
  
 
 
                                                 
appliances in each product class.a For the LCC and PBP analyses of standard­sized products, 
DOE assigned a baseline price from that distribution to each household sampled from the EIA’s 
2005 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS).1 For compact product classes, DOE 
assigned a baseline price from the distribution to each sampled product. Appendix 8­C presents 
the distribution histograms DOE developed for each product class. The average baseline retail 
prices before sales tax for each refrigeration product class are shown in Table 8.2.1.

8.2.1.2 Increases in Manufacturer Selling Price  
DOE used a combination of cost data submitted by the Association of Home Appliance 
Manufacturers (AHAM)4 and a reverse engineering analysis to estimate increases to 
manufacturing cost associated with increases in efficiency levels for refrigeration products. Refer 
to Chapter 5, Engineering Analysis, for details. Adding the manufacturer markup described in 
chapter 6 yielded the MSP increases for each considered efficiency level and product class 
shown in Tables 8.2.2 through 8.2.4. 
a DOE assumed that prices for non­ENERGY STAR models are a reasonable approximation of prices for the 
baseline models.

DOE defines operating cost (OC) by the following equation.  
OC   EC  RC  MC  
Where:

8.2.2.1 Annual Energy Consumption 
As described in Chapter 7, Energy Use Determination, DOE developed samples of 
individual households that use each of the standard­sized refrigeration products considered 
herein. By developing the samples, DOE was able to calculate the LCC and PBP for each 
household to account for the variability in both energy use and energy price associated with that 
household. 
Tables 8.2.8 through 8.2.10 are derived from the analysis described in chapter 7. The 
values shown for annual energy consumption are averages in the field. For compact products, 
DOE did not use the RECS sample, and the energy consumption is as measured using the DOE 
test procedure. DOE captured the variability in energy consumption by using a range of values in 
its LCC and PBP analyses.

8.2.2.2 Energy Prices 
Using data from EIA Form 8615, DOE derived average energy prices for 13 geographic 
areas in the United States: the nine U.S. Census divisions, plus four large states (New York, 
Florida, Texas, and California) considered individually. For Census divisions containing one of 
those large states, DOE left out data for the large state when calculating average regional values.

For example, the Pacific region average excludes California, and the West South Central region 
excludes Texas. Using the modified regional data, DOE assigned an appropriate energy price to 
each household in the sample.   
DOE used data from EIA to estimate electricity prices for residential consumers in each 
of the 13 geographic areas These data, which are published annually, include annual electricity 
sales in kilowatt hours (kWh), revenues from electricity sales, and number of consumers by 
sector for every utility that serves final consumers. The calculation of an area­average residential 
or commercial electricity price proceeds in two steps. 
1.  For each utility, an average sector (residential or commercial) price is estimated by 
dividing sector revenues by sector sales. 
2.  An average regional price is calculated, whereby each utility having customers in a 
region is weighted by the number of residential consumers served in that region. 
The calculation used the most recent EIA data available at the time the analysis was conducted. 
Table 8.2.11 shows the average residential and commercial electricity price in 2007 for each

Table 8.2.11 by the forecast of annual average price changes in the EIA’s AEO 2009.2 To 
estimate the trend after 2030, DOE followed guidelines that the EIA had provided to the Federal

Energy Management Program, which called for using the average rate of change for electricity 
during 2020–2030. 
The Department calculated LCC and PBP for each class of refrigeration products using 
three separate projections from AEO 2009: reference, low, and high economic growth. 
Alternative assumptions regarding the future growth in energy markets reflects the uncertainty 
regarding economic conditions during the forecast period. Figure 8.2.1 shows the projected 
trends in residential and commercial electricity prices based on the AEO 2009 reference case. 
For the LCC results presented in this chapter, DOE used only the energy price forecasts from the 
AEO reference case.

8.2.3.1 Estimated Survival Function 
The Energy Information Agency (EIA)’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey 
(RECS)1 of occupied primary housing units records the presence of various appliances in each 
household, and places the age of each appliance into bins comprising several years. Data from
the U.S. Census’s American Housing Survey (AHS),6 which surveys all housing including vacant 
and second homes, enabled DOE to adjust the RECS data to reflect some appliance use outside 
of primary residences. By combining the results of both surveys with the known history of 
appliance shipments (collected from Appliance magazine or directly from manufacturer trade 
associations), DOE estimated the percentage of appliances of a given age still in operation. This 
survival function, which DOE assumed has the form of a cumulative Weibull distribution, 
provides an average and a median appliance lifetime. 
  The Weibull distribution is a probability distribution commonly used to measure failure 
rates.b Its form is similar to an exponential distribution, which models a fixed failure rate, except 
that a Weibull distribution allows for a failure rate that changes over time in a particular fashion. 
The cumulative Weibull distribution takes the form: 
§ xT ·E ¨ ¸P(x)  e © D ¹ for x > ș and 
P(x) = 1 for x  ș 
Where: 
P(x) =  probability that the appliance is still in use at age x;  
x =  appliance age;  
Į =  scale parameter, which would be the decay length in an exponential distribution;  
ȕ =  shape parameter, which determines the way in which the failure rate changes through  
time; and 
ș =  delay parameter, which allows for a delay before any failures occur. 
When ȕ = 1, the failure rate is constant over time, giving the distribution the form of a
cumulative exponential distribution. In the case of appliances, ȕ commonly is greater than 1, 
reflecting an increasing failure rate as appliances age.  
The RECS survey is DOE’s primary resource for appliance ages. For several appliances, 
including refrigerators and freezers, the survey asks respondents to identify the appliance’s age 
as: 
x less than 2 years old, 
x 2 to 4 years old, 
x 5 to 9 years old, 
b For reference on the Weibull distribution, see sections 1.3.6.6.8 and 8.4.1.3 of the NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook

x 10 to19 years old, or 
x more than 20 years old. 
The RECS survey has been conducted every three or four years for the past several 
decades. For this analysis, DOE used the surveys conducted in 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, and 
2005. DOE used the AHS count of housing units that contain refrigerators to scale the RECS 
data to better match the total installed stock. The U.S. Census AHS does not include data on 
freezers. DOE used the RECS micro­data to exclude from this analysis refrigerators that are both 
“half­height” and less than 10 cubic feet in capacity, because such refrigerators are not standard­
sized. To determine overall refrigerator lifetime, DOE included all appropriately sized 
refrigerators, whether the household’s first (primary) or second refrigerator. Households that did 
not know the age of their appliance were allocated among the remaining age bins according to 
the distribution of respondents who did report the appliance age. 
Refrigerator ownership exhibits complex consumer behavior, which is not adequately 
reflected in AHS. In particular, AHS records only whether a housing unit contains a refrigerator, 
not the number of refrigerators. In addition, AHS may record a unit as containing a refrigerator 
when it contains a compact, rather than standard­size, appliance. Therefore, DOE used AHS only 
to scale the number of first refrigerators recorded by RECS. The baseline number of refrigerators 
reported in each RECS age bin is the sum of the AHS­scaled first refrigerators and the un­scaled, 
standard­size second refrigerators. 
DOE adjusted the RECS survey data to account for the fact that the RECS survey begins 
its reference year with July, whereas shipments data are provided for each calendar year. DOE 
adjusted the data by using the survival function to model the additional retirement and 
replacement of appliances that takes place in the latter half of a survey year (after a given 
respondent is surveyed). 
DOE used the RECS data on appliance ages, combined with the history of appliance 
shipments, to develop survival functions for refrigeration products. For example, DOE summed 
the total shipments from 5 to 9 years before each RECS survey, then compared this number with
the number of units still in use at the time of the survey to approximate the percentage of
surviving appliances within that age bin. By combining the age bins from the five RECS surveys 
with shipments data, DOE had enough data to use a least­squares method to build a fit to a 
Weibull distribution and find the parameters (Į, ȕ, ș) that best approximate the number of 
surviving units. Because the first two (youngest) RECS bins tend to have a large scatter relative 
to the shipments in those years, DOE combined the RECS and shipments data in the first two 
bins. Refrigerators and freezers generally do not fail during their first four years, so combining 
bins did not lower appreciably the accuracy of the distribution. DOE weighted each bin’s 
contribution to the sum of squares by the inverse of the variance in RECS survey results, which 
controls for the changes in sample size between bins and through time.c RECS has a complex

error model. DOE used only the error due to finite sample size to determine the variance for 
weighting the age bins. The equation for the sum of squares that DOE minimized is: 
RECSi  Survi 2 ¦ V 2 , i i,RECS 
Where:  
i =  the identifier for a bin from a single RECS;  
RECSi = the number of appliances reported by RECS in bin I;  
Survi =  the number of surviving appliances in bin i predicted by the Weibull distribution  
applied to the number of appliances shipped (a function of Į, ȕ, and ș); and 
ıi,RECS =  the standard error (square root of the variance) of the RECS data point for bin i. 
Table 8.2.13 shows the RECS data for refrigerators, the associated total shipments, and 
the best­fit Weibull calculation of stock by age bin. Figure 8.2.2  plots the data from the third and 
fourth columns of  Table 8.2.12 against each other to show the quality of the fit. DOE allowed the 
delay parameter, ș, to vary only between 1 and 5 years, which corresponds to common warranty 
periods (see discussion below). For refrigerators and freezers, the best fit within this range is 5 
years. 
The Weibull distribution, shown in  Figure 8.2.3, is characterized by the parameters Į = 
13.91, ȕ = 1.68, and ș = 5.0. This distribution has a mean refrigerator lifetime of 17.43 years and 
a median lifetime of 16.18 years.

The method DOE used to calculate product lifetimes incorporates several assumptions: 
•  Appliance lifetime can be modeled by a survival function. In particular, a Weibull 
distribution is an appropriate survival function. 
•  The appliance survival function does not change through time. 
•  The survival function is independent of other household factors (such as household 
size or geographic region) as well as product class (within standard­size refrigerators 
or freezers).
•  RECS respondents neither systematically overestimated nor underestimated the 
current age of their appliance. 
•  The historical shipment data are accurate. 
•  The shipped appliances are installed exclusively (or almost exclusively) in residences. 
•  The Weibull delay parameter, ș, is limited to between 1 and 5 years. 
Three of these assumptions reflect analytical choices made by DOE. The first is the 
assumption that a Weibull distribution is the appropriate distribution to use for rates of appliance 
retirement. This distribution is the standard one used in lifetime analyses, but it is not guaranteed 
to reflect actual real­world experience. The second assumption is that consumer behavior and 
mechanical appliance lifetime have not changed over time. This assumption required DOE to 
treat equally all data from the several RECS surveys. Using only recent surveys (which may 
better reflect recent consumer behavior and appliance lifetime) would provide only a few data 
points for attempting least­squares fits, producing large statistical uncertainty. 
The third assumption concerns the Weibull delay parameter. DOE limited the delay 
parameter to between 1 and 5 years to reflect the range of common appliance warranties. A delay 
of less than 1 year would imply that some appliances fail or are replaced within their first year of
use. A delay of more than 5 years would imply that no appliances are replaced for some time
after the end of the longest standard warranty. Fits using ș > 5 also commonly show nonsensical 
behavior, with sharp changes in consumer behavior or appliance survival immediately following 
the delay period. 
8.2.3.2 Conversion of First to Second Refrigerators 
When a household purchases a new refrigerator, sometimes it uses its original unit as a 
secondary appliance in the basement or garage. DOE modeled the process by which first 
refrigerators are converted to second refrigerators as a Weibull process having a cumulative 
distribution of the form: 
§ §¨ xT ·E · ¸P(x)  G  (1G )u¨1 e © D ¹ ¸ for x > ș and¨ ¸© ¹ 
P(x) = į for x  ș 
8­23  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where:  
P(x) =  probability that the appliance has been converted at age x;  
x =  appliance age;  
Į =  the scale parameter, which would be the decay length in an exponential distribution;  
ȕ =  the shape parameter, which determines the way in which the conversion rate changes  
through time; 
į =  the percentage of shipments that are used immediately as second refrigerators; and 
ș =  the delay parameter, which allows for a delay before any conversions occur. 
Rather than comparing second refrigerators to shipments, DOE compared them with the 
existing total installed base of refrigerators of a certain age, as measured by RECS. As with 
calculating appliance lifetime, the RECS data were adjusted with AHS data. In essence, DOE 
constructed a Weibull distribution to model a conversion function rather than a survival function. 
In addition, the model allows for the direct purchase of a new second refrigerator. A refrigerator 
bought to be a second refrigerator is modeled as being converted from first to second 
immediately at purchase; the offset parameter į represents those units. Refrigerators commonly 
are bought to be second units, as indicated by the relatively large number of young second 
refrigerators reported by in RECS surveys. 
DOE fit the conversion function using results from the 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2005 
RECS. The RECS micro­data again enabled removing refrigerators that are not standard size, 
which has a significant effect given that many compact refrigerators are used as second units. In 
Table 8.2.12 the fifth column shows the RECS­derived stock of second refrigerators by age bin, 
and the sixth column shows the best fit from a Weibull distribution.  Figure 8.2.4 shows the 
Weibull distribution. The best­fit Weibull parameters for the conversion function are Į = 38.12, ȕ 
= 2.03, and ș = 0.0, with an offset of 5.6 percent (meaning that 5.6 percent of shipments are sold 
as new second refrigerators). Roughly 1.5 percent of surviving refrigerators are converted from
first to second refrigerator status each year, and roughly 20 percent of surviving refrigerators are 
converted to second refrigerators before they reach 15 years of age.

Figure 8.2.4 Function for Conversion of First to Second Refrigerator-Freezers 
8.2.3.3 Standard-Size Freezers 
DOE assumed relatively simple consumer behavior related to freezers. DOE did not 
model the conversion from first to second freezer for households having more than one freezer, 
but simply used all freezer data from RECS. Standard­sized freezers were assumed to have a 
capacity greater than 10 cubic feet. As with refrigerators, RECS bins were adjusted for units 
replaced in the second half of a year to synchronize the RECS and shipments data. RECS did not 
collect freezer lifetime data in 1990, so DOE used results from only the 1993, 1997, 2001, and 
2005 surveys. The U.S. Census AHS survey does not report data on freezers, so the RECS bins 
were not scaled by the AHS total as for refrigerators. Before 2005, RECS reported the age 
distribution only for a household’s first freezer, so DOE assumed that second and third freezers 
have the same age distribution as first freezers. 
The best­fit Weibull parameters for freezer lifetime are Į = 19.49, ȕ = 2.40, and ș = 5.0. 
The resulting calculated mean freezer lifetime is 22.28 years; the median is 21.73 years.  Table 
8.2.13 lists the (adjusted) number of freezers reported in each RECS age bin, along with the 
modeled stock based on the best­fit Weibull survival function and the manufacturer­provided 
shipments history.  Figure 8.2.5 shows the survival function used for standard­size freezers in the

8.2.3.4 Compact Refrigeration Products 
As mentioned previously, compact refrigeration products are used in the residential and 
commercial sectors. RECS micro­data identify households that have refrigerators that are “half­
height” and less than 10 cubic feet in capacity. DOE considered those households as potentially 
using compact refrigerators. EIA’s Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) 
survey of 20037 notes the presence of a residential­style refrigerator in an establishment. 
However, CBECS provides no further detail regarding the size of the refrigerator. Thus, RECS 
and CBECS data together do not provide enough detail on compact refrigerators to develop a 
survival function similar to the ones developed for standard­sized refrigerator­freezers and 
freezers. 
DOE assumed that a Weibull distribution remains the appropriate functional form to 
represent retirement rates of compact refrigeration products. DOE initially used the average 
value of lifetime and historical shipments data from Appliance magazine to estimate Weibull 
parameters for compact refrigerators. When DOE applied the average lifetime of 10 years, given 
in Appliance magazine, to historical shipments, the model yielded a stock of compact 
refrigerators that was more than double the stock indicated by RECS and CBECS. DOE 
8­27  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
            
      
therefore calibrated the average lifetime to match the stock of compact refrigerators as reported 
by the surveys. 
The estimated Weibull parameters for compact refrigerator lifetime are Į = 5.75 and ȕ = 
1.75. The resulting calculated mean lifetime is 5.62 years. For determining the lifetime of 
compact freezers, DOE used a scaling factor proportional to the ratio of the lifetimes of standard­
sized refrigerators and standard­sized freezers. The calculated mean lifetime of a compact freezer 
is 7.46 years. 
8.2.4 Discount Rates 
The discount rate is the rate at which DOE discounts future expenditures to establish their 
present value. DOE derived discount rates for the LCC and PBP analyses from estimates of the 
cost to finance the purchase of the considered products. Following financial theory, the financal 
cost of raising funds to purchase appliances can be interpreted as: (1) the financial cost of any 
debt incurred to purchase a product, or (2) the opportunity cost of any equity used to purchase a 
product. In addition to estimating discount rates for appliances bought directly by consumers, 
DOE also estimated discount rates for purchasers of compact refrigerators and freezers in the 
commercial sector. 
8.2.4.1 Discount Rates for Residential Consumers 
Households use various methods to finance the purchase of major appliances. In 
principle, one could estimate the interest rates on the actual financing vehicles used to purchase 
appliances. The frequency with which each financing vehicle is used to purchase an appliance is 
unknown, however. 
DOE’s approach involved identifying all possible debt or asset classes that might be used 
to purchase the considered appliances, including household assets that might be affected 
indirectly.d  DOE excluded debt from primary mortgages and the equity of assets considered 
non­liquid (such as retirement accounts), because those are unlikely to be used to purchase 
appliances. DOE estimated the average percentage shares of the various types of debt and equity 
in the average U.S. household using data from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer 
Finances (SCF) for 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007.8 Table 8.2.15 shows the 
average percentages of each considered type of debt or equity. DOE derived the mean 
percentages of each source of financing throughout the 7 years surveyed. 
d  An indirect effect would arise if a household sold assets in order to pay off a loan or credit card debt that might
have been used to finance the appliance purchase.

nominal rates in each year and the inflation factors used to calculate real rates. DOE calculated

interest on both such loans is tax deductible. Table 8.2.17 shows the average effective real rates 
in each year and the mean rate across years. Because the interest rates for each type of household 
debt reflect economic conditions throughout numerous years, they are expected to be 
representative of rates that may be in effect in 2014.

* No data on interest rates available for credit cards in 1989 or 1992.
No similar rate data are available from the SCF for classes of assets, so the Department 
derived that information from national historical data. The interest rates associated with 
certificates of deposit,9 savings bonds,10 and bonds (AAA corporate bonds)11 were collected from
Federal Reserve Board time­series data for 1977–2008. DOE assumed rates on checking 
accounts to be zero. Rates on savings and money market accounts came from Cost of Savings 
Index data covering 1984–2008. 12 The rates for stocks are the annual returns on the Standard and 
Poor’s 500 for 1977–2008. 13 Rates for mutual funds are a weighted average of the stock rates 
(two­thirds weight) and the bond rates (one­third weight) in each year for 1977–2008. DOE 
adjusted the nominal rates to real rates using the annual inflation rate for each year. Average 
nominal and real interest rates for the classes of household assets are listed in Table 8.2.18. 
Because the interest and return rates for each type of asset reflect economic conditions 
throughout numerous years, they are expected to be representative of rates that may be in effect 
in 2014.

8.2.4.2 Assignment of Discount Rates to Sample Households 
To account for variations among households, DOE assigned each sampled RECS 
household a rate from a distribution of rates for each type of debt and equity. DOE developed a 
probability distribution of interest rates based on SCF data. Appendix 8­C presents the 
probability distribution of interest rates that DOE used in the LCC and PBP analyses. 
8.2.4.3 Discount Rates for Commercial Purchasers 
DOE derived the discount rate for commercial owners of compact refrigeration products 
from the cost of capital of publicly traded firms in the sectors that purchase those products. The 
firms typically finance equipment purchases through debt and/or equity capital. DOE estimated 
the cost of the firms’ capital as the weighted average of the cost of equity financing and the cost 
of debt financing for each year between 2001 and 2008. 
The costs of debt and equity financing usually are publicly available for firms in the 
lodging and other commercial sectorse that may purchase compact refrigeration products.  
DOE estimated the cost of equity using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).14 The 
CAPM assumes that the cost of equity (ke) for a given company is proportional to the systematic 
risk faced by that company, whereby high risk is associated with a high cost of equity and low 
e The “other commercial” sector includes financial institutions and all services other than lodging (SIC 6­8).

risk is associated with a low cost of equity. The systematic risk facing a firm is determined by 
several variables: the risk coefficient of the firm (ȕ), the expected return on risk­free assets (Rf), 
and the equity risk premium (ERP). The risk coefficient of a firm describes the risk associated 
with that firm represented by standard deviations in the firm’s stock price. The expected return 
on risk­free assets is defined by the yield on long­term government bonds. The ERP represents 
the difference between the expected stock market return and the risk­free rate. To estimate the 
expected return on risk­free assets and the equity risk premium, DOE used stock and bond data 
from Damodaran Online, a widely used source of information about debt and equity financing 
for most types of firms. 15,16 The Damodaran Online data were adjusted for annual inflation 
using deflator data for the gross domestic product from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ 
National Income and Product Accounts Tables.17 
The cost of equity financing is estimated using the following equation: 
ke = R f + (E× ERP) 
Where: 
ke =  cost of equity,  
Rf =  inflation­adjusted expected return on risk­free assets,f  
ȕ =  risk coefficient of the firm, and  
ERP =  equity risk premium.  
The cost of debt financing (kd) is the interest rate paid on money a company borrows. The 
cost of debt is estimated by adding a risk adjustment factor (Ra) to the risk­free rate. This risk 
adjustment factor depends on the variability of stock returns represented by standard deviations 
in the firm’s stock price. Thus for firm i, the cost of debt financing is: 
k = R + Rdi f ai 
Where: 
kd =  cost of debt financing for firm i,  
Rf =  expected return on risk­free assets, and  
Rai =  risk adjustment factor to risk­free rate for firm i.  
DOE estimates the weighted­average cost of capital using the following equation. 
WACC = k × w + k × we e d d 
Where: 
WACC = weighted average cost of capital, 
f Ibbotson Associates argues that the arithmetic mean equates the expected future value with the present value and
should be used in calculating the risk­free rate and equity risk premium when using CAPM to estimate discount 
rates (Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation 2009 Yearbook, Ibbotson Associates, p. 60).

In calculating the discount rate for companies that typically purchase compact 
refrigeration products, DOE generated a distribution of discount rates within each sector. The 
standard deviation of the distribution for each sector is provided in Table 8.2.22. Weighting each 
sector’s discount rate by its share of compact refrigerator purchases,g DOE estimated that the

published, or January 2014. The Department calculated the life­cycle cost (LCC) for all 
consumers as if each would purchase a new appliance in the year the standard is to take effect.   
8.2.6 Base-Case Energy Efficiencies 
To estimate the percentage of consumers who would be affected by a standard at any of 
the potential efficiency levels, in its LCC analysis DOE considered the projected distribution of 
efficiencies for products that consumers purchase under the base case (the case without new 
energy efficiency standards). DOE refers to this distribution of product energy efficiencies as the 
base­case efficiency distribution. Using the projected distribution of efficiencies for each product 
class, DOE randomly assigned a product efficiency to each sample household. If a household 
was assigned a product efficiency that was greater than or equal to the efficiency of the standard 
level under consideration, the LCC calculation would show that this household would not be 
affected by that standard level. 
DOE began with the energy efficiency distribution (market shares) for refrigeration 
products in 2007 based on data provided by AHAM19. In 2007, efficiency level 2 for 
refrigerator­freezers corresponded to the efficiency required for ENERGY STAR certification. In
2008, the criteria changed so that efficiency level 3 corresponded to the efficiency required for 
ENERGY STAR certification. If the market shares of refrigeration products by efficiency were 
the same in 2008 as in 2007, the ENERGY STAR market share would be 0 percent for top­
mount refrigerators, 18 percent for bottom­mount refrigerators, and 2 percent for side­by­side 
refrigerators.
Efforts to promote ENERGY STAR products through various means, including consumer 
rebates, are expected to increase their market shares by 2014. Although it is difficult to predict 
appliance sales in 2014, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in market shares of ENERGY 
STAR products will follow the same pattern as they did between 2001 (the year in which the 
current DOE standards took effect and caused a shift in ENERGY STAR requirements) and 
2007. The projected market shares of efficiency levels are shown in Table 8.2.23. As shown, the 
assumed market share of ENERGY STAR models in 2014 (under current requirements) is equal 
to the market share of ENERGY STAR models in 2007 (under the old requirements). For 
example, because 32 percent of side­by­side refrigerator­freezers qualified for ENERGY STAR 
(efficiency level 2 and higher) under the pre­2008 requirements, DOE assumed that 32 percent 
would meet ENERGY STAR requirements (efficiency level 3) in 2014. DOE also assumed that 
the market shares of lower­efficiency models (i.e., baseline and 10 percent below baseline) 
would stay the same between 2007 and 2014.

8.3 INPUTS TO PAYBACK PERIOD ANALYSIS  
The payback period (PBP) refers to the time it takes a consumer to recover, through 
lower operating costs, the assumed higher purchase cost of more energy efficient products. 
Numerically, the PBP is the ratio of the increase in purchase cost (from a less to a more efficient 
design) to the decrease in annual operating cost. This type of calculation is known as a simple 
payback period, because it does not account for changes in operating cost over time or the time
value of money. That is, the calculation is performed at an effective discount rate of 0 percent.  
The equation for determining PBP is: 
'IC
PBP = 'OC 
Where: 
ǻIC = the difference in total installed cost between the more efficient design based on the new 
standard level and the baseline design, and  
ǻOC =  the difference in annual operating cost between the two units.   
Payback periods are expressed in years. Payback periods greater than the life of a product 
mean that the increased total installed cost is not recovered through reduced operating cost. 
The data inputs to calculating PBP are the total installed cost to the consumer for each
product at each efficiency level and the annual (first­year) operating cost for each efficiency 
level. The inputs to calculating total installed cost are the product and installation costs. The 
inputs to calculating operating cost are the annual energy, repair, and maintenance costs. The 
PBP uses the same inputs as the LCC analysis described in section 8.2, except that no energy 
8­37  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
price trends, product lifetimes, or discount rates are required. Because the PBP is a simple 
payback, the only energy price required is for the year in which a new standard takes effect—in 
this case, the price projected for 2014. 
8.4 RESULTS OF ANALYSES  
This section presents the results of the life­cycle cost (LCC) and payback period (PBP) 
analyses for the considered efficiency levels for refrigeration products. As discussed in section 
8.1.1, DOE’s approach to the LCC analysis involved developing a sample of consumers who use 
each product. DOE also used probability distributions to characterize the uncertainty in many of 
the analytical inputs. DOE used a Monte Carlo simulation technique to perform the LCC 
calculations on data pertaining to the consumers in each sample. For each set of sample 
consumers who use the appliance in each product class, DOE calculated the average LCC, the 
LCC savings, and the median and average PBP for each standard level.   
DOE calculated LCC savings and PBPs relative to the base­case product that it assigned 
to the sampled consumers. As discussed in section 8.2.6, DOE assigned some consumers a base­
case product that is more efficient than the baseline product. For that reason, average LCC 
impacts are not equal to the difference between the LCC of a specific possible standard level and 
the LCC of the baseline product. 
In the following subsections, DOE presents figures showing the distribution of LCCs in 
the base case for each product class. Also presented are figures showing the distribution of LCC 
impacts and the distribution of PBPs for specific possible standard levels. The figures represent 
frequency charts that include probabilities of occurrence for the distributions of LCC impacts 
and PBPs. DOE generated the figures for the distributions from a Monte Carlo simulation that 
utilized 10,000 samples.  
LCC and PBP calculations were performed 10,000 times on the sample of consumers 
developed for each product. Each calculation was performed on a single consumer who was 
selected from the sample. The selection was based on weight, that is on how representative a 
particular consumer was of other consumers in the national distribution. Each LCC and PBP 
calculation also sampled from the probability distributions that DOE developed to characterize 
many of the inputs to the analysis.     
Based on the Monte Carlo simulations that DOE performed, for each efficiency level,
DOE calculated the percentage of consumers who would experience a net LCC benefit, a net 
LCC cost, or no impact. DOE considered a consumer to receive no impact at a given efficiency 
level if the base­case product DOE assigned to that consumer had the same or higher efficiency 
than that of the new standard being evaluated. Note that the average LCC savings at each 
efficiency level are relative to the base­case efficiency distribution, not the baseline efficiency 
level.

8.4.1 Standard-Size Refrigerator-Freezers 
The following subsections summarize results of LCC and PBP analyses for standard­size 
refrigerator­freezers and present figures showing the distribution of LCCs in the base case for 
each product class. Also presented are figures showing the distribution of LCC impacts and the 
distribution of PBPs for specific efficiency levels. 
8.4.1.1 Summary of Results 
Tables 8.4.1 through 8.4.3 show the LCC and PBP results for each refrigerator­freezer 
product class considered for new standards. DOE determined the median and average values for 
PBPs at each efficiency level by excluding those households that would not be affected by the 
standard.

8.5 REBUTTABLE PAYBACK PERIOD 
DOE presents rebuttable PBPs to provide information for considering the legally 
established rebuttable presumption that an energy efficiency standard is economically justified if 
the additional product costs attributed to the standard are less than three times the value of the 
first­year savings in energy costs. (42 U.S.C. §6295 (o)(2)(B)(iii)) 
8.5.1 Metric 
The basic equation for rebuttable PBP is the same as that shown in section 8.3, Inputs to 
Analysis of Payback Period. Unlike the analyses described in sections 8.2 and 8.3, however, the 
rebuttable PBP is not based on the use of household samples and probability distributions. 
Rather, it is based on discrete, single­point values. For example, although DOE uses a probability 
distribution of regional energy prices in the analysis of payback period, it uses only the national 
average energy price from the probability distribution to determine the rebuttable PBP. 
Other than the use of single­point values, the most notable difference between the 
distribution PBP and the rebuttable PBP is the latter’s reliance on the DOE test procedure to 
determine a product’s annual energy consumption.   
8.5.2 Inputs to Rebuttable Payback Period Analysis 
The following were the key inputs that DOE used in determining rebuttable PBP. 
•  Incremental manufacturing costs, markup, baseline retail price, sales tax, and 
installation costs were all based on single­point values derived from, or used as inputs 
to, the distributional LCC and PBP analysis. 
•  Annual energy consumption was based on results of the proposed DOE test procedure 
for a product with the average adjusted volume from the LCC and PBP analysis. 
•  Energy prices were based on average values for the year that new standards are 
assumed to take effect (2014). 
An average discount rate or lifetime is not required in calculating the rebuttable PBP. 
8.5.3 Results of Analysis 
DOE calculated rebuttable PBPs for each standard level relative to the purchase and 
operating costs of an average baseline product. 
Table 8.5.1 presents the rebuttable PBPs for each standard­size refrigerator product class 
that DOE analyzed for the LCC and PBP analysis.

8-A.2 BASIC INSTRUCTIONS 
Basic instructions for operating the LCC spreadsheets are as follows: 
1.  Once you have downloaded the LCC file from the Web, open the file using Excel. At the 
bottom, click on the tab for sheet ‘LCC Summary’.  
2.  Use Excel’s “View/Zoom” commands at the top menu bar to change the size of the 
display to make it fit your monitor. 
3.  The user interacts with the spreadsheet by clicking choices or entering data using the 
graphical interface that comes with the spreadsheet. Select choices from the various 
inputs listed under "User Options" heading. 
4.  Under the "User Options" heading, select choices from the selection buttons and boxes 
for the following: (1) type of calculation (Sample or Crystal Ball®), (2) energy price
Trend, (3) start year, and (4) efficiency market share scenario. By overwriting the code in 
the LCC summary sheet, a new discount rate or lifetime can be entered if a value other 
than the default value is wanted . The Department does not recommend saving the 
spreadsheet after the code is changed.
5.  To change inputs listed under "User Input", select the input you wish to change by either 
clicking on the appropriate button or selecting the appropriate input from the input box. 
6.  This spreadsheet gives the user two types of calculation methods:  
a.  If the "Sample Calc" is selected, then all calculations are performed for single input 
values, usually an average. The new results are shown on the same sheet as soon as 
the new values are entered.  
b.  Alternately, if the "CB Calculation" is selected, the spreadsheet generates results that 
are distributions. Some of the inputs are also distributions. The results from the LCC 
distribution are shown as single values and refer only to the results from the last

Monte Carlo sample and are therefore not meaningful. To run the distribution version 
of the spreadsheet, the Microsoft Excel® add-in software called Crystal Ball® must 
be enabled. 
To produce sensitivity results using Crystal Ball, simply select Run from the Run menu 
(on the menu bar). To make basic changes in the run sequence, including altering the number of 
trials, select Run Preferences from the Run menu. After each simulation run, the user needs to 
select Reset (also from the Run menu) before Run can be selected again. Once Crystal Ball has 
completed its run sequence it will produce a series of distributions. Using the menu bars on the 
distribution results, it is possible to obtain further statistical information. The time taken to 
complete a run sequence can be reduced by minimizing the Crystal Ball window in Microsoft 
Excel. A step-by-step summary of the procedure for running a distribution analysis is outlined 
below: 
1.  Find the Crystal Ball toolbar (at top of screen) 
2.  Click on Run from the menu bar  
3.  Select Run Preferences and choose from the following choices: 
a.  Monte Carloa 
b.  Latin Hypercube (recommended) 
c.  Initial seed choices and whether you want it to be constant between runs 
d.  Select number of Monte Carlo Trials (DOE suggests 10,000). 
4. To run the simulation, follow the following sequence (on the Crystal Ball toolbar) 
Run  
Reset  
Run  
5.  Now wait until the program informs you that the simulation is completed. 
The following instructions are provided to view the output generated by Crystal Ball.
1.  After the simulation has finished, to see the distribution charts generated, click on the 
Windows tab bar that is labeled Crystal Ball.  
2.  The life-cycle cost savings and payback periods are defined as Forecast cells. The 
frequency charts display the results of the simulations, or trials, performed by Crystal 
Ball. Click on any chart to bring it into view. The charts show the low and high endpoints 
of the forecasts. The View selection on the Crystal Ball toolbar can be used to specify 
whether you want cumulative or frequency plots shown.  
a Because of the nature of the program, there is some variation in results due to random sampling when Monte Carlo 
or Latin Hypercube sampling is used.

3.  To calculate the probability that a particular value of LCC savings will occur, either type 
0 in the box by the left arrow, or move the arrow key with the cursor to 0 on the scale. 
The value in the Certainty box shows the likelihood that the LCC savings will occur. To 
calculate the certainty of payback period being below a certain number of years, choose 
that value as the high endpoint. 
4.  To generate a printout report, select Create Report from the Run menu. The toolbar 
choice of Forecast Windows allows you to select the charts and statistics in which you 
are interested. For further information on Crystal Ball outputs, please refer to 
Understanding the Forecast Chart in the Crystal Ball manual.

APPENDIX 8-B.  UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY  
8-B.1 INTRODUCTION  
Analysis of an energy-efficiency standard involves calculations of impacts, for example, 
the impact of a standard on consumer life-cycle cost (LCC).  In order to perform the calculation, 
the analyst must first: 1) specify the equation or model that will be used; 2) define the quantities 
in the equation; and 3) provide numerical values for each quantity.  In the simplest case, the 
equation is unambiguous (contains all relevant quantities and no others), each quantity has a 
single numerical value, and the calculation results in a single value.  However, unambiguity and 
precision are rarely the case.  In almost all cases, the model and/or the numerical values for each 
quantity in the model are not completely known (i.e., there is uncertainty) or the model and/or 
the numerical values for each quantity in the model depend upon other conditions (i.e., there is 
variability).
Thorough analysis involves accounting for uncertainty and variability.  While the 
simplest analysis involves a single numerical value for each quantity in a calculation, arguments 
can arise about what the appropriate value is for each quantity.  Explicit analysis of uncertainty 
and variability is intended to provide more complete information to the decision-making process. 
8-B.2 UNCERTAINTY
When making observations of past events or speculating about the future, imperfect 
knowledge is the rule rather than the exception.  For example, the energy actually consumed by a 
particular appliance type (such as the average U.S. commercial air conditioner or heat pump) is 
not directly recorded, but rather estimated based upon available information.  Even direct 
laboratory measurements have some margin of error.  When estimating numerical values 
expected for quantities at some future date, the exact outcome is rarely known in advance. 
8-B.3 VARIABILITY 
Variability means that different applications or situations produce different numerical 
values when calculating a quantity. Specifying an exact value for a quantity may be difficult 
because the value depends on something else.  For example, the number of hours an air 
conditioner is operated by a household depends upon the specific circumstances and behaviors of 
the occupants (e.g., number of persons, personal habits about how comfortable the person wants 
to be, etc.). Variability makes specifying an appropriate population value more difficult in as 
much as any one value may not be representative of the entire population.  Surveys can be 
helpful here, and analysis of surveys can relate the variable of interest (e.g., hours of use) to 
other variables that are better known or easier to forecast (e.g., persons per household).

8-B.4 APPROACHES TO UNCERTAINTY AND VARIABILITY 
This section describes two approaches to uncertainty and variability:  
• scenario analysis, and 
• probability analysis. 
Scenario analysis uses a single numerical value for each quantity in a calculation, then
changes one (or more) of the numerical values and repeats the calculation.  A number of 
calculations are done, which provide some indication of the extent to which the result depends 
upon the assumptions. For example, the life-cycle cost of an appliance could be calculated for 
energy rates of 2, 8, and 14¢ per kWh. 
The advantages of scenario analysis are that each calculation is simple; a range of 
estimates is used; and crossover points can be identified.  (An example of a crossover point is the 
energy rate above which the life-cycle cost is reduced, holding all other inputs constant. That is, 
the crossover point is the energy rate at which the consumer achieves savings in operating 
expense that more than compensate for the increased purchase expense.) The disadvantage of 
scenario analysis is that there is no information about the likelihood of each scenario. 
 Probability analysis considers the probabilities within a range of values.  For quantities 
with variability (e.g., electricity rates in different households), surveys can be used to generate a 
frequency distribution of numerical values (e.g., the number of households with electricity rates 
at particular levels) to estimate the probability of each value.  For quantities with uncertainty, 
statistical or subjective measures can be used to provide probabilities (e.g., manufacturing cost to 
improve energy efficiency to some level may be estimated to be $10 ± $3).   
The major disadvantage of the probability approach is that it requires more information, 
namely information about the shapes and magnitudes of the variability and uncertainty of each 
quantity. The advantage of the probability approach is that it provides greater information about 
the outcome of the calculations, that is, it provides the probability that the outcome will be in a 
particular range. 
Scenario and probability analysis provide some indication of the robustness of the policy 
given the uncertainties and variability.  A policy is robust when the impacts are acceptable over a 
wide range of possible conditions. 
8-B.5 PROBABILITY ANALYSIS AND THE USE OF CRYSTAL BALL 
To quantify the uncertainty and variability that exist in inputs to the engineering, LCC, 
and payback period (PBP) analyses, the Department used Microsoft Excel spreadsheets 
combined with Crystal Ball, a commercially available add-in, to conduct probability analyses.  
The probability analyses used Monte Carlo simulation and probability distributions.

Simulation refers to any analytical method meant to imitate a real-life system, especially 
when other analyses are too mathematically complex or too difficult to reproduce.  Without the 
aid of simulation, a spreadsheet model will only reveal a single outcome, generally the most 
likely or average scenario. Spreadsheet risk analysis uses both a spreadsheet model and 
simulation to automatically analyze the effect of varying inputs on outputs of the modeled 
system. One type of spreadsheet simulation is Monte Carlo simulation, which randomly 
generates values for uncertain variables again and again to simulate a model.  Monte Carlo 
simulation was named for Monte Carlo, Monaco, where the primary attractions are casinos 
containing games of chance. Games of chance such as roulette wheels, dice, and slot machines, 
exhibit random behavior.  The random behavior in games of chance is similar to how Monte 
Carlo simulation selects variable values at random to simulate a model. When you roll a die, you 
know that either a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 will come up, but you do not know which for any particular 
roll. It's the same with the variables that have a known range of values but an uncertain value for 
any particular time or event (e.g., equipment lifetime, discount rate, and installation cost).  
For each uncertain variable (one that has a range of possible values), possible values are 
defined with a probability distribution. The type of distribution selected is based on the 
conditions surrounding that variable.  Probability distribution types include:  
NORMAL TRIANGULAR UNIFORM 
Figure 8-B.5.1 Normal Probability Figure 8-B.5.2 Triangular Figure 8-B.5.3 Uniform Probability
Distribution Probability  Distribution 
Distribution
During a simulation, multiple scenarios of a model are calculated by repeatedly sampling 
values from the probability distributions for the uncertain variables and using those values for the 
cell. Crystal Ball simulations can consist of as many trials (or scenarios) as desired—hundreds or 
even thousands. During a single trial, Crystal Ball randomly selects a value from the defined 
possibilities (the range and shape of the probability distribution) for each uncertain variable and 
then recalculates the spreadsheet.   
For each uncertain variable (one that has a range of possible values), possible values are 
defined with a probability distribution. The type of distribution selected is based on the 
conditions surrounding that variable.  Probability distribution types include:

APPENDIX 8-C.  CONSUMER RETAIL PRICE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR BASELINE  
REFRIGERATOR-FREEZERS AND FREEZERS 
8-C.1 INTRODUCTION 
DOE’s engineering analysis did not attempt to estimate the manufacturing cost for 
baseline models. Instead, it developed incremental increases in manufacturer selling price 
associated with increases in efficiency levels. This approach required DOE to estimate retail 
prices for the baseline model in each product class.  
DOE drew upon proprietary retail price data collected by The NPD Group.1 These data 
reflect retail prices and sales at a large number of retail outlets in the United States (including 
over 50 percent of retail sales), and include information regarding model number, refrigerated 
volume, configuration of doors and ice-making, and whether the unit is an ENERGY STAR 
product. The data include enough information to assign each model to the correct product class. 
DOE developed a sales-weighted price distribution for non-ENERGY STAR appliances in each 
product class from this data. DOE grouped models by selling price in bins of varying width 
(generally $25 for compact products and $50 to $100 for standard-sized products) in order to 
balance the accuracy and usability of the distributions. These distributions are shown in the 
following section. 
DOE assumed that prices for non-ENERGY STAR models are a reasonable 
approximation of prices for the baseline models. These models may be “baseline” in efficiency, 
but span a wide range of other features and materials, and therefore have a broad distribution of 
prices. DOE chose not to develop volume-dependent baseline retail prices because the data did 
not show a strong relationship between volume and retail price. The price distributions within 
most volume ranges and product classes are almost as broad as the volume-independent 
distributions DOE chose to use, and regression analysis indicated very weak dependence of 
average price on volume.

APPENDIX 8-D.  HOUSEHOLD DISCOUNT RATE DISTRIBUTIONS 
8-D.1 INTRODUCTION 
DOE derived discount rates for the LCC analysis using data on interest or return rates for 
various types of debt and equity. To account for variation among households in rates for each of 
the types, DOE sampled a rate for each household from a distribution of rates for each debt and 
equity type. This appendix describes the distributions used. 
8-D.2 DISTRIBUTION OF MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES 
Figure 8-D.2.1 shows the distribution of real interest rates for new home mortgages. 
The data source DOE used for mortgage interest rates is the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of 
Consumer Finances (SCF) in 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004 and 2007.1 Using the 
appropriate SCF data for each year, DOE adjusted the nominal mortgage interest rate for each 
relevant household in the SCF for mortgage tax deduction and inflation. In cases where the 
effective interest rate is equal to or below the inflation rate (resulting in a negative real interest
rate), DOE set the real effective interest rate to zero.

8-D.3  DISTRIBUTION OF RATES FOR TYPES OF DEBT AND EQUITY USED
TO FINANCE REPLACEMENT FURNACES 
Figure 8-D.3.1 through Figure 8-D.3.5 show the distribution of real interest rates for 
different types of debt used to finance replacement furnaces. The data source for the interest rates 
for home equity loans, credit cards, installment loans, other residence loans, and other lines of 
credit is the Federal Reserve Board’s SCF in 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2007.1 
DOE adjusted the nominal rates to real rates using the annual inflation rate in each year. For 
home equity loans, DOE calculated effective interest rates in a similar manner as for mortgage 
rates, since interest on such loans is tax deductible.

8-D.4  DISTRIBUTION OF RATES FOR TYPES OF EQUITY USED TO 
FINANCE REPLACEMENT FURNACES 
Figure 8-D.4.1 through Figure 8-D.4.6 show the distribution of real interest rates for 
different types of equity used to finance replacement furnaces. Data for equity classes are not 
available from the Federal Reserve Board’s SCF, so the Department derived data for these 
classes from national-level historical data. The interest rates associated with certificates of 
deposit (CDs),2 savings bonds,3 and bonds (AAA corporate bonds)4 are from Federal Reserve 
Board time-series data covering 1977–2007. DOE assumed rates on checking accounts to be 
zero. Rates on savings and money market accounts are from Cost of Savings Index data covering 
1984–2007.5 The rates for stocks are the annual returns on the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 in 
the 1977–2007 period.6 The mutual fund rates are a weighted average of the stock rates (two-
thirds weight) and the bond rates (one-third weight) in each year of the 1977–2007 period. DOE 
adjusted the nominal rates to real rates using the annual inflation rate in each year.

CHAPTER 9.  SHIPMENTS ANALYSIS  
9.1 INTRODUCTION  
Estimates of future product shipments are a necessary input to calculations of the national 
energy savings (NES) and net present value (NPV), as well as to the manufacturer impact 
analysis (MIA). This chapter describes the data and methods the U.S. Department of Energy 
(DOE) used to forecast annual product shipments and presents results for each of the 
refrigeration product classes being considered in this analysis. 
DOE defined four refrigeration product types, and developed models to estimate 
shipments for each type. The four types are: (1) standard­size refrigerator­freezers, (2) standard­
size freezers, (3) compact refrigerators, and (4) compact freezers. DOE calibrated each model 
against historical shipments. To estimate the effects of potential standard levels on shipments of 
each product class, each model was structured to account for the combined effects on consumer 
purchase decisions of changes in product cost, annual operating cost, and household income. 
Each model considers specific market segments to estimate shipments of individual 
product classes within each segment. The analytical results from these segments then are 
aggregated to estimate total shipments for each product class and type. For the product types 
included in this analysis, DOE considered three market segments: (1) new construction or new 
owners; (2) replacements for failed products; and (3) for standard­size refrigerators, the purchase 
of an additional refrigerator. 
The shipments models were developed as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that are 
accessible on the Internet (www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/). Appendix 10­
A discusses how to access and utilize the shipments model spreadsheets, which are integrated 
into spreadsheets for the National Impact Analysis. The rest of this chapter explains the 
shipments models in more detail. Section 9.2 presents methodology behind the models; section 
9.3 describes the data inputs and calibration of each model; section 9.4 discusses impacts on 
shipments from changes in product cost, operating cost, and household income; section 9.5 
discusses the affected stock; and section 9.6 presents the shipments forecast for different energy 
conservation standard­level scenarios. 
9.2 SHIPMENTS MODEL METHODOLOGY 
DOE developed a model of the national stock of in­service appliances for estimating 
annual shipments for each of the four product types considered for this standards rulemaking. 
The model considers market segments as distinct inputs to the shipments forecast. As represented 
by the following equation, the two primary market segments for standard­size products are new 
installations and replacements.

Ship ( j ) = Rpl ( j ) + NI ( j )p p p 
Where: 
Shipp(j) = total shipments of product p in year j, 
Rplp(j) = units of product p retired and replaced in year j, and  
NIp(j) =  number of new installations of product p in year j. 
DOE’s shipments models take an accounting approach, tracking market shares of each 
product class, the vintage of units in the existing stock, and expected construction trends. Rather 
than simply extrapolating a current shipments trend, the analysis of the base case for each type 
(i.e., the case without new standards) uses input variables as drivers, including construction 
forecasts and product lifetime distributions, to forecast sales in each market segment. As a result, 
DOE’s shipments models assume that new construction drives shipments. 
To estimate shipments of replacement units, the models utilize shipments data from
previous years and assumptions about the lifetime of each product. Estimated shipments of 
replacement units in a given year are equal to the total stock of the appliance minus those units 
shipped in previous years that remain in the stock. DOE determined the useful service life of 
each product class to estimate how many years it is likely to remain in stock. The following 
equation shows how DOE estimated shipments of replacement units. 
_ageMax j 1 
Rpl p ( j ) = Stock p ( j 1) 䌥 䌥Ship j × probRtr ( age ) 
age=0  j= N 
Where: 
Stockp (j-1) =  total stock of  appliances in year j-1, 
probRtr (age) = probability that an appliance of a particular age will be retired, and 
N =  year in which the model begins its stock accounting (start year is specific to each 
product type, and is based on available historical shipments data). 
Stock accounting provides an estimate of the age distribution of product stocks for all 
years, using product shipments, a retirement function, and initial product stock as inputs. The age 
distribution of product stocks is a key input to both the NES and NPV calculations because the 
operating costs for any year depend on the age distribution of the stock. Operating cost is 
dependent on the product age distribution under a standards case scenario that produces 
increasing efficiency over time, where older, less efficient units may have higher operating costs, 
while younger, more­efficient units will have lower operating costs. 
DOE calculated total stock of each product by integrating historical shipments data 
beginning with a specific year.  The start year depended on the historical data available for the 
product. As units are added to the stock, some of the older ones retire and exit the stock. To 
9­2

estimate future shipments, DOE developed a series of equations that define the dynamics and 
accounting of stocks. For new units, the equation is: 
_Stock( j ,age = 1) = Ship( j 1) 
Where:  
Stock(j, age) = number of units of a particular age, 
j = year for which the stock is being estimated, and 
Ship (j) = number of units purchased in year j. 
The above equation states that the number of one­year­old units is simply equal to the number of 
new units purchased the previous year. Slightly more complicated equations, such as the 
following equation, describe how the model accounts for the existing stock of units.  
Stock( j +1,age +1) = Stock( j ,age )×[1 _ prob Rtr ( age )] 
In this equation, as the year is incremented from j to j+1, the age is also incremented from age to 
age+1. Over time, a fraction of the stock is removed; that fraction is determined by a retirement 
probability function, probRtr(age), which is described in section 9.3. Because the products 
considered in this rulemaking are common appliances that have been used by U.S. consumers for 
a long time, replacements typically constitute the majority of shipments.  
9.3 DATA INPUTS AND MODEL CALIBRATION   
For standard­size products designed for residential application, DOE used two inputs to 
estimate shipments driven by new construction: new housing forecasts and saturation of the 
product in new housing. New housing includes newly constructed single­ and multi­family units, 
termed “new housing completions,” and mobile home placements. For new housing completions 
and mobile home placements, DOE used recorded data through 2007, and adopted the 
projections from the DOE Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s Annual Energy Outlook 
2009 (AEO2009) for the period 2008–2030.1 To determine new construction shipments for 
standard­size products, DOE used forecasts of market saturations combined with forecasts of 
housing starts. For compact products, which are used in both residential and commercial 
applications, DOE used market saturations in combination with forecasts of housing starts and 
new commercial construction. 
DOE estimated replacements using product retirement functions that it developed based 
on product lifetimes. The retirement functions for all product types are described in detail in 
chapter 8. The retirement functions use the following equation to determine the probability of
retirement at a certain age for the considered products: 
9­3

_ageMax j 1 
Rpl p ( j ) = Stock p ( j 1) 䌥 䌥Ship j × probRtr ( age ) 
age=0  j= N 
Where: 
Stockp (j-1) =  total stock of appliances in year j-1,  
Shipj =  shipments in year j,  
probRtr (age) = probability that an appliance of a particular age will be retired, and  
N =  year in which the model begins its stock accounting (start year is specific to each  
product type, and is based on available historical shipments data). 
DOE used historical shipments data to calibrate its shipments models.  For standard­size 
refrigerator­freezers and standard­size freezers, modeled new construction shipments and 
replacements were insufficient to account for all product shipments. DOE therefore developed 
two additional market segments to calibrate its model: “additional refrigerator purchase” for 
refrigerators and “existing homes without the appliance” for freezers. The “additional 
refrigerator purchase” segment represents those purchases that are meant to be used as a new 
primary refrigerator while the former primary refrigerator is converted to a second refrigerator, 
as well as a small number of direct purchases of second refrigerators. Chapter 8 describes in 
detail how DOE estimated the probability that a primary refrigerator will be converted to a 
second refrigerator. 
The following sections explain in detail each of the data inputs for each product type. 
9.3.1 Standard-size Refrigerator-Freezers 
DOE considered seven product classes of standard­size refrigerator­freezers for this 
rulemaking. DOE’s shipments model for these product classes used the aggregate shipments, that 
is, the shipments for all seven product classes, as the basis for its forecasts. DOE did not develop 
a separate shipments model for each refrigerator­freezer product class. Instead, DOE 
disaggregated total shipments into product classes using various data and assumptions. 
9.3.1.1 Historical Shipments 
DOE used historical shipments data (i.e., domestic shipments and imports) to populate 
and calibrate its shipments model for standard­size refrigerator­freezers. It used the following 
sources to establish historical shipments: Appliance magazine’s Statistical Review,2,3,4 AHAM 
Factbooks,5,6 and an AHAM data submittal related to this rulemaking.7 Table 9.3.1 summarizes 
the historical shipments data. DOE developed a total stock estimate by integrating historical 
shipments. Over time, some of the units are retired and removed from the stock, triggering the 
purchase of a new unit. Because of the relationship between retirements and total stock, there is a 
strong correlation between past and future shipments, independent of conservation standards.

9.3.1.2 Markets and Model Calibration 
The market for standard­size refrigerator­freezers is primarily comprised of units for new 
construction, replacement units for products that have been retired, and purchases driven by the

conversion of an existing unit from first to second refrigerator. Total shipments are represented 
by the following equation: 
ShipSRRF ( j)   RplSRRF ( j)  NH SRRF ( j)  ConvSRRF ( j) 
Where:  
ShipSRRF (j) =  total shipments of standard­size refrigerator­freezers in year j,  
RplSRRF (j) =  replacement shipments in year j,  
NH SRRF(j) =  shipments to new households in year j, and  
ConvSRRF (j)=  shipments due to additional refrigerator purchase (conversion of first to second  
refrigerator) in year j. 
The following sections discuss these three markets in further detail.  
 New Construction. To estimate shipments driven by new residential construction, DOE 
multiplied the housing starts forecast for each year by the estimated saturation of standard­size 
refrigerator­freezers in new housing. DOE based saturation for a given year on the calculated 
saturation in the previous year. DOE froze the saturation at the level corresponding to year 2008 
(1.3 per new home), the last year for which shipments data are available. The following equation 
describes the method used for calculating saturation for new construction: 
Sat NC ( j 1)   Stock( j) / HStock( j) 
Sat ( j)   Sat (2008)j ! 2008NC NC 
Where: 
SatNC(j) = market saturation of standard­size refrigerator­freezers in the new housing market 
segment in year j, 
Stock(j) =  total stock of standard­size refrigerator­freezers in year j, 
HStock(j) =  total number of housing units in year j, and 
SatNC(2008) = market saturation of standard­size refrigerator­freezers in the new housing market 
segment in 2008.  
Table 9.3.2 presents historical and forecasted new housing starts based on EIA’s 
AEO2009 for the period 1990–2030. AEO2009 provides three sets of housing starts forecasts, 
based on economic growth scenarios: a Reference case, a High Economic Growth case, and a 
Low Economic Growth case. DOE used the Reference Case that incorporates the effects from
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.1  DOE used the high and low growth scenarios 
from the March 2009 release of the AEO2009.8  DOE used the forecasts from the Reference case 
to estimate its shipments to new housing, which is comprised of single­ and multi­family units 
(new housing completions) and mobile home placements. For 2031í2043, DOE froze 
completions at the 2030 level for all three economic scenarios.

% Retiring 
 Replacements. DOE determined refrigerator­freezer shipments to the replacement market 
using an accounting method that tracks the total stock of units by vintage. DOE estimated a stock 
by vintage by integrating historical shipments. Over time, some units are retired and removed 
from the stock, thereby triggering the shipment of replacement units. A certain percentage 
(depending on the age) of units will fail each year and need to be replaced. To determine when a 
unit fails, DOE used a survival function based on a product lifetime distribution with an average 
value of 17.1 years. Chapter 8 provides a more thorough discussion of product lifetimes. Figure 
9.3.1 shows the survival and retirement functions that DOE used to estimate replacement 
shipments for all product classes of standard­size refrigerator­freezers.

Shipments Due to Additional Refrigerator Purchase. To calibrate estimated shipments 
with historical data, DOE introduced into the model a market segment corresponding to 
purchases of additional standard­size refrigerator­freezers that are not intended as replacements. 
Because such purchases involve converting a first unit to a second refrigerator, DOE estimated 
shipments to this market segment by applying the probability of conversion (developed in 
chapter 8) to the stock of surviving refrigerators. To determine when a household converts a first 
refrigerator to a second one, DOE used a conversion function based on the total installed stock of 
refrigerators of a certain age. Chapter 8 provides a detailed discussion of the conversion function. 
The following equation shows how DOE calculated shipments to this market segment.

9.3.1.3 Disaggregation into Separate Refrigerator-Freezer Product Classes 
DOE examined the historical trends in the market shares of various refrigerator­freezer 
configurations to disaggregate the total shipments of refrigerator­freezers into shipments to each 
of the three considered refrigerator­freezer product categories (top­mount, bottom­mount and 
side­by­side configurations). The market share of side­by­side refrigerator­freezers models has 
grown significantly during the past two decades. Bottom­freezer models historically have had a 
small market share, but that share has grown in recent years. To forecast the market share for 
these three configurations throughout the 30­year analysis period (beginning in 2014), DOE built 
a simple model of aggregate consumer behavior, fit its model to the historical growth in side­by­
side market share, and then used its model to estimate future market shares for all three 
configurations. 
DOE assumed that bottom­freezer models were an insignificant portion of the market 
prior to 2005, and that consumer behavior related to these classes in the future would mirror 
behavior regarding side­by­side models. Therefore, DOE forecast the combined market share for 
side­by­side and bottom­freezer products. DOE assumed that the ratio between the market share 
of bottom­mount and the market share of side­mount products would remain fixed at its 2008 
value. 
DOE based its model on the market share of each product category as reported by 
households in the Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption 
Survey9 (RECS) and as reported by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
(AHAM).7 RECS reports whether a household owns a side­by­side refrigerator, but does not 
distinguish between top­ and bottom­mount units. For the purpose of this model, DOE assumed 
that all recently­purchased top­or­bottom­mount refrigerators reported in the RECS surveys 
conducted in 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2005 are top­mount units.  
DOE used RECS data first to estimate the maximum (“limiting”) market share that side­
by­side and bottom­mount product classes would attain in the future. RECS reports the income
of each household in its sample. DOE assumed that households that have annual incomes greater 
than $100,000 and that own their own homes are able to select the appliance that best meets their 
needs and preferences. The market share of side­by­side units in these households is significantly 
9­9

higher than the current overall market share of side­by­side products. DOE determined market 
shares for recent purchases from RECS by considering only households which reported 
purchasing their appliance within two years prior to the survey. The market share of side­by­side 
refrigerator purchases in the selected household group from each RECS survey is shown in Table 
9.3.3. Over time, DOE assumed that all homeowners will be free to choose the product of their 
choice, as DOE assumed high­income homeowners can today. As a result, DOE assumed that 
market share of side­by­side units among all homeowners will increase until it equals the mean 
market share among high­income home­owning households, 66.4 percent.

DOE used RECS to determine what percent of side­by­side units is sold to home­owners 
in order to convert a limiting market share among home­owning households into a market share 
for all shipments. This pecentage was roughly constant in the five most recent RECS surveys, 
and DOE assumed that it would remain equal to their mean, 90.9 percent, throughout the forecast 
period. DOE also assumed that the percent of American households that own their home would 
return to its historical level of roughly 65 percent by 2025. (American home ownership was 
between 63 percent and 66 percent from 1962 to 1997, peaked at 69 percent in 2004, and fell to 
67.8 percent in 2008.) 
DOE combined the three factors (the observed preference of high­income consumers, 
percent of side­by­side refrigerator­freezers purchased by homeowners, and homeownership) to 
predict the limiting market share for the side­ and bottom­freezer product classes. This limit is

SFHO =  the percentage of side­by­side and bottom­mount products sold to homeowners 
(90.9 percent). 
DOE modeled the approach to this limiting value as an exponential curve, and fit the 
model parameters to data from RECS and AHAM in order to determine the rate at which the 
market will approach the limit. RECS micro­data enabled DOE to determine the approximate 
market share of side­by­side products among all homeowners in the years preceding each RECS 
survey (1989, 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004). DOE also calculated the market share among 
homeowners from the AHAM data by multiplying by 90.9 percent (SFHO) and dividing by the 
homeownership (HO) for each year. The resulting estimates for market shares of side­by­side 
products among homeowners are shown in Table 9.3.4.

9.3.2 Standard-size Freezers 
DOE considered four product classes of standard­size freezers in its analysis. DOE’s 
shipments model for these classes uses the aggregate shipments for all four product classes as the 
basis for its forecasts. In other words, DOE did not develop a separate shipments model for each 
freezer product class. Instead, DOE used various data and assumptions to disaggregate total 
shipments into product classes.  
9.3.2.1 Historical Shipments 
DOE used data on historical shipments (i.e., domestic shipments and imports) from
Appliance magazine’s Statistical Review,10 AHAM Factbook,5 and an AHAM data submittal7 to 
populate and calibrate its shipments model. DOE built up a total stock of freezers by integrating 
historical shipments. Over time, some of the units are retired and removed from the stock, 
triggering the shipment of new units to replace them. Because of the relationship between 
retirements and total stock, there is a strong correlation between past and future shipments, 
independent of conservation standards. Table 9.3.6 summarizes the historical shipments data for 
standard­size freezers.

9.3.2.2 Markets and Model Calibration 
The shipments market for standard­size freezers is primarily comprised of units for new
construction and replacement units for products that have been retired. DOE’s shipments model 
also assumes that some existing households that do not currently own the appliance (i.e. EHA) 
will enter the market as new owners. Total shipments are represented by the following equation:
Ship ( j)   Rpl ( j)  NH ( j)  EHA ( j)SF SF SF SF 
Where:  
ShipSF (j) =  total shipments of standard­size freezers in year j,  
RplSF (j) =  replacement shipments in year j,  
NH SF(j) =  shipments to new households in year j, and  
EHASF (j)= shipments to existing households without the appliance in year j.  
The following sections discuss all three of these markets in further detail.
New Construction. To forecast the shipments of standard­size freezers for new 
construction for any given year, DOE multiplied the forecasted housing starts by the forecasted 
saturation of standard­size freezers for new housing. DOE used saturation in new housing from
the 1993, 1997, 2001, and 2005 RECS surveys.8 DOE determined the saturations in new homes 
by using a sample of RECS household records whose home is less than 5 years old, with freezers

of age less than 5 years. DOE froze the saturation at the estimated level corresponding to year 
2007 (0.119 per new home). Table 9.3.7 presents the freezer saturation data in new housing

Replacements. DOE determined shipments to the replacement market using an 
accounting method that tracks the total stock of units by vintage. DOE estimated the stock of 
standard­size freezers by vintage by integrating historical shipments. Over time, some units are 
retired and removed from the stock, triggering the shipment of a replacement unit. A certain 
percentage (depending on the age) of units will fail each year and need to be replaced. To 
determine when a unit fails, DOE used a survival function based on a product lifetime 
distribution that had an average value of 22.7 years. Chapter 8 presents a more thorough 
discussion of the lifetimes of standard­size freezers. Figure 9.3.5 shows the survival and 
retirement functions that DOE used to estimate shipments of replacement freezers.

Figure 9.3.5 Standard-size Freezers: Survival and Retirement Functions 
Model Calibration—New Owners. To calibrate estimated shipments with the historical 
data, DOE introduced a market segment that consists of households that currently do not own a 
freezer. DOE estimated shipments to this market segment as residual historical shipments after 
shipments for new housing and replacements were subtracted from total shipments. DOE then 
used a 3­year moving average to estimate the percent of households who enter the market as new 
owners for 2008­2043. The following equation illustrates the calculations. 
EHASF ( j)   (1  StockSat j ) u HStock j u EHAfrac j 
Where:  
EHASF (j) =  number of freezers shipped to existing households without the appliance in year j,  
StockSatj = stock saturation of freezers in year j,  
HStockj =  housing stock in year j, and  
EHAfracj =  fraction of housing units without the appliance and obtain a freezer in year j.  
9.3.2.3 Disaggregation into Separate Freezer Product Classes 
To disaggregate the total shipments of standard­size freezers into shipments to each of
the freezer product classes, DOE used the market share information submitted by AHAM.7 The 
data submitted by AHAM provided an aggregated market share of 50.6 percent for product

classes 8 and 10. DOE then used the shipments data from the 2005 AHAM Fact Book5 and 
Appliance magazine2 to disaggregate market shares for product classes 8 and 10. The AHAM 
Fact Book indicates a 59.5 percent market share for the combination of product classes 10 and 
10A. Since the market share for 10A is near zero, DOE attributed the combined market share of 
product classes 8 and 10 from the AHAM data submittal (50.6 percent) entirely to product class 
10 in order to be as close as possible to the AHAM Fact Book data.  Table 9.3.8 presents the 
market share forecast used for disaggregating modeled shipments. DOE used these estimated 
market shares throughout the forecast period.

9.3.3.2 Markets and Model Calibration 
The market for compact refrigerators is primarily comprised of units that replace products 
that have been retired from service, and units installed in new housing, new lodging in the 
commercial sector (such as hotel rooms and dormitories), and in other new construction in the

commercial sector. Total compact refrigerator shipments are represented by the following 
equation: 
Ship ( j)   Rpl ( j)  NH ( j)  NLodg ( j)  NOthComm ( j)CRRF CRRF CRRF CRRF CRRF 
Where: 
ShipCRRF (j) =  total shipments of compact refrigerators in year j, 
RplCRRF(j) =  replacement shipments in year j, 
NHCRRF (j) = shipments to new households in year j, 
NLodgCRRF (j) =  shipments to new lodging units in year j, and 
NOthCommCRRF (j) =  shipments to other new commercial establishments in year j. 
The following sections discuss these markets.  
 New Housing. To estimate shipments to new housing in each year, DOE multiplied 
forecasted housing starts by the estimated saturation of compact refrigerators in new housing 
units. DOE forecasted market saturation for this segment using the saturation of compact 
refrigerators in newly built homes in RECS 2001 and 2005 (2.7 percent and 3.2 percent, 
respectively). For years beyond 2005, DOE maintained the growth in new housing saturation 
measured between 2001 and 2005.  
New Lodging and Other Commercial New Construction. To estimate shipments to new 
commercial establishments, DOE used forecasts of new construction in lodging and other 
commercial establishments coupled with market saturation data (in units per building). DOE 
obtained the saturation data from the American Lodging Association (ALA)11 and the EIA’s 
Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS).12 For lodging, DOE used
saturations from ALA for the years 1998, 2003, and 2008. For future years, DOE maintained the 
growth in saturation rates seen between 2003 and 2008. For other commercial applications, DOE 
used saturations from CBECS for the years 1999 and 2003. DOE maintained the growth in 
saturation rates seen between 1999 and 2003 for subsequent years. 
Figure 9.3.8 presents the forecast for saturation of compact refrigerators for the three 
market segments for new construction.

Model Calibration. To calibrate estimated shipments with the historical data, DOE
utilized compact refrigerator stock data for 2003. DOE obtained commercial stock data from
CBECS 2003 and estimated the 2003 residential stock from various years of RECS. Based on

9.3.4 Compact Freezers 
DOE considered three product classes of compact freezers for this analysis. DOE based 
its forecast shipments compact freezers on aggregate shipments, that is, shipments for all three 
product classes. In other words, DOE did not develop a separate shipments model for each 
product class. Instead, DOE used various data and assumptions to disaggregate total estimated 
shipments into product classes. 
9.3.4.1 Historical Shipments 
DOE used data on historical shipments (domestic shipments and imports) to populate and 
calibrate its shipments model for compact freezers. It obtained historical shipments data from
data submitted by AHAM7 and various issues of Appliance magazine2,9 ( Table 9.3.11). DOE 
built up a total stock of compact freezers by integrating historical shipments. Over time, some
units are retired and removed from the stock, triggering the shipment of new units to replace 
them. Because of the relationship between retirements and total stock, there is a strong
correlation between past and future shipments.

9.3.4.2 Markets and Model Calibration 
The market for compact freezers is primarily comprised of replacement units for products 
that have been retired from service and units purchased by new owners (not new construction) in 
both residential and commercial sectors. Total compact freezer shipments are represented by the 
following equation:

Where: 
ShipCF (j) =  total shipments of compact freezers in year j,  
RplCF (j) =  replacement shipments in year j,  
NR CF(j) =  shipments to new residential owners in year j, and  
NCCF (j)= shipments to new commercial owners in year j.  
The following sections discuss these markets in further detail.  
 Replacements. DOE determined shipments to the replacement market using an 
accounting method that tracks the total stock of units by vintage. DOE integrated historical 
shipments to estimate each year’s stock of compact freezers by vintage. Over time, some units 
are retired and removed from the stock, triggering the shipment of a replacement unit. A certain 
percentage (depending on the age) of units will fail each year and need to be replaced. To 
determine when a compact freezer fails, DOE used a product survival function based on a 
lifetime distribution with an average value of 7.46 years. Chapter 8 provides a more thorough 
discussion of product lifetimes for compact freezers. Figure 9.3.12 shows the survival and 
retirement functions that DOE used to estimate shipments of replacement units.

9.4  PURCHASE PRICE, OPERATING COST, AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME 
IMPACTS
DOE conducted a literature review and an analysis of appliance price and efficiency data 
to estimate the combined effects on product shipments from increases in product purchase price, 
decreases in product operating costs, and changes to household income. Appendix 9­A provides 
a detailed explanation of the methodology DOE used to quantify the impacts from these 
variables. 
In the literature, DOE found only a few studies of appliance markets that are relevant to 
this rulemaking analysis. DOE identified no studies that use time­series data of product price and 
shipments data after 1980. The information that can be summarized from the literature suggests 
that the demand for appliances is price­inelastic. Other information in the literature suggests that 
appliances are a normal good, such that rising incomes increase the demand for appliances. 
Finally, the literature suggests that consumers use relatively high implicit discount ratesb when 
comparing appliance prices and appliance operating costs.  
b A high implicit discount rate with regard to operating costs means that consumers do not put much economic value 
on the operating cost savings realized from more­efficient appliances. In other words, consumers are much more 
concerned with higher purchase prices.

DOE found insufficient data on product purchase price and operating cost to perform a 
thorough analysis of dynamic changes in the appliance market. Rather, it used purchase price and 
efficiency data specific to residential refrigerators, clothes washers, and dishwashers over the 
period 1980–2002 to evaluate broad market trends and conduct simple regression analyses. 
These data indicate that there has been a rise in appliance shipments and a decline in appliance 
purchase price and operating costs over the time period. Household income has also risen during 
this time. To simplify the analysis, DOE combined the available economic information into one 
variable, termed the relative price, and used this variable in an analysis of market trends, as well 
as to conduct a regression analysis. The relative price is defined with the following expression: 
TP PP + PVOC
RP = = 
Income Income 
Where: 
RP =  relative price, 
TP =  total price, 
Income =  household income, 
PP =  appliance purchase price, and 
PVOC = present value of operating cost. 
In this equation, DOE used an implicit discount rate of 37 percent to determine the 
present value of operating costs. 
DOE’s analysis of market trends suggests that the relative price elasticity of demand for 
the three appliances is relatively inelastic (i.e., under 1.0). DOE’s regression analysis suggests 
that the relative price elasticity of demand, averaged over the three appliances, is ­0.34. For 
example, a relative price increase of 10 percent results in a 3.4 percent decrease in shipments. 
Note that, because the relative price elasticity incorporates the impacts from three effects (i.e., 
purchase price, operating cost, and household income), the impact from any single effect is 
mitigated by changes from the other two effects. The relative price elasticity of ­0.34 is 
consistent with estimates in the literature. Nevertheless, DOE stresses that the measure is based 
on a small data set, using simple statistical analysis. More importantly, the measure is based on 
an assumption that economic variables, including purchase price, operating costs, and household 
income, explain most of the trend in appliances per household in the United States since 1980. 
Changes in appliance quality and consumer preferences may have occurred during this period, 
but DOE did not account for them in this analysis. Despite these uncertainties, DOE believes that
its estimate of the relative price elasticity of demand provides a reasonable assessment of the 
impact that purchase price, operating cost, and household income have on product shipments. 
Because DOE’s forecasts of shipments and national impacts due to standards is over a 
30­year time period, it needed to consider how the relative price elasticity is affected once a new 
standard takes effect. DOE considered the relative price elasticity provided by the preceeding 
9­30

analysis to be a short­run value. It was unable to identify sources specific to household durable 
goods, such as appliances, to indicate how short­run and long­run price elasticities differ. 
Therefore, to estimate how the relative price elasticity changes over time, DOE relied on a study 
pertaining to automobiles.15 This study shows that the automobile price elasticity of demand 
changes in the years following a purchase price change. With increasing years after the purchase 
price change, the price elasticity becomes smaller (more inelastic) until it reaches a terminal 
value around the tenth year after the price change. Table 9.4.1 shows the relative change in the 
price elasticity of demand for automobiles over time. DOE developed a time series of relative 
price elasticities for home appliances based on the relative change in the automobile price 
elasticity of demand. For years not shown in  Table 9.4.1, DOE performed a linear interpolation 
to obtain the relative price elasticity.

Based on the following equation, DOE estimated standards case shipments by 
incorporating the impact of the relative price into the base case shipments forecast. Note that in

(stock that is affected by a standards level) consists of those in­service units that are purchased in 
or after the year the standard has taken effect, as described by the following equation: 
_j Std _ yr 
Aff Stock ( j ) = Ship ( j ) +  䌥Stock ( age )p p p 
age=1 
Where:  
Aff Stockp(j) = affected stock of units of product p of all vintages that are in service in year j,  
Shipp(j) =  shipments of product p in year j,  
Stockp(j) = stock of units of product p of all vintages that are in service in year j,  
age =  age of the units (years), and  
Std_yr = effective date of the standard.  
For the NES and NPV results presented in Chapter 10, DOE assumed that new energy 
efficiency standards will become effective in the year 2014. Thus, all appliances purchased 
starting on the first day of the year 2014 are affected by the standard level.

This section presents the shipments forecasts for the various standard levels that DOE 
considered for each of the four refrigeration product types.

APPENDIX 9-A. RELATIVE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND FOR APPLIANCES 
9-A.1 INTRODUCTION 
This appendix summarizes DOE’s study of the price elasticity of demand for home
appliances, including refrigerators, clothes washers and dishwashers.  DOE chose this particular 
set of appliances because of the availability of data to determine a price elasticity.  This appendix 
begins with a review of the existing economics literature describing the impact of economic 
variables on the sale of durable goods in section 9A.2.  In section 9A.3, the market for home
appliances and changes in it over the past 20 years is described.  In section 9A.4, DOE 
summarizes the results of its regression analysis and presents estimates of the price elasticity of
demand for the three appliances.  In section 9A.5, DOE presents development of an ‘effective’ 
purchase price elasticity. DOE’s interpretation of its results is presented in section 9A.6.   
Finally, section 9A.7 describes the data used in DOE’s analysis. 
9-A.2 LITERATURE REVIEW 
There are relatively few studies measuring the impact of price, income and efficiency on 
the sale of household appliances.  In this section DOE provides a short review of this literature 
which suggests the likely importance of these variables.
9-A.2.1 Price 
The goal of many of the studies covered in this review is to measure the impact of price 
on sales in a dynamic market.  One study of the automobile market prior to 1970 finds the price 
elasticity of demand to decline over time.  The author explains this as the result of buyers 
delaying purchases after a price increase but eventually making the purchase (Table 9A.2.1).1  A 
contrasting study of household white goods also prior to 1970, finds the elasticity of demand to 
increase over time as more price-conscious buyers enter the market.2   A recent analysis of 
refrigerator market survey data finds that consumer purchase probability decreases with survey 
asking price.3   Estimates of the price elasticity of demand for different brands of the same
product tend to vary. A review of 41 studies of the impact of price on market share found the 
average price elasticity to be -1.75.4   The average estimate of price elasticity of demand reported 
in these studies is -0.33 in the appliance market and -0.47 in the combined automobile and 
appliance markets.  
9-A.2.2 Income 
Higher income households are more likely to own household appliances.5  The impact of 
income on appliance shipments is explored in two econometric studies of the automobile and 
appliance markets. 1,2  The average income elasticity of demand is 0.50 in the appliance study 
cited in the literature review, much larger in the automobile study (Table 9.A.2.1).

9-A.2.3  Appliance Efficiency and Discount Rates 
Many studies estimate the impact of appliance efficiency on consumer appliance choice.  
Typically, this impact is summarized by the implicit discount rate, i.e., the rate consumers use to 
compare future appliance operating cost savings against an appliance purchase price premium.
One early and much cited study concludes that consumers use a 20 percent implicit discount rate 
when purchasing room air conditioners (Table 9A.2.1).6  A survey of several studies of different 
appliances suggests that the consumer implicit discount rate has a broad range and averages 
about 37 percent.7

9-A.3 VARIABLES DESCRIBING THE MARKET FOR REFRIGERATORS, 
CLOTHES WASHERS, AND DISHWASHERS 
In this section DOE evaluates variables that appear to account for refrigerator, clothes 
washer and dishwasher shipments, including physical household/appliance variables, and 
economic variables.

9-A.3.4 Physical Household/Appliance Variables 
Several variables influence the sale of refrigerators, clothes washers and dishwashers.  
The most important for explaining appliance sales trends are the annual number of new 
households formed (housing starts) and the number of appliances reaching the end of their 
operating life (replacements).  Housing starts influence sales because new homes are often 
provided with, or soon receive, new appliances, including dishwashers and refrigerators.  
Replacements are correlated with sales because new appliances are typically purchased when old 
ones wear out. In principle, if households maintain a fixed number of appliances, shipments 
should equal housing starts plus appliance replacements.  
9-A.3.5 Economic variables 
Appliance price, appliance operating cost and household income are important economic 
variables affecting shipments.  Low prices and costs encourage household appliance purchases 
and a rise in income increases householder ability to purchase appliances.  In principle, changes 
in economic variables should explain changes in the number of appliances per household.    
During the 1980–2002 study period, annual shipments grew 69 percent for clothes 
washers, 81 percent for refrigerators and 105 percent for dishwashers (Table 9A.3.1).  This rising 
shipments trend is explained in part by housing starts, which increased 6 percent and by 
appliance replacements, which rose between 49 percent and 90 percent, depending on the 
appliance, over the period (Table 9A.3.1).a  For mature markets such as these, replacements 
exceed appliance sales associated with new housing construction.

2Housing Starts: Annual number of new homes constructed. Source: U.S. Census.  
3Replacements: Average of annual lagged shipments, with lag equal to expected appliance operating life, ± 5 years.  
Nevertheless, it is apparent that appliance shipments increased somewhat more rapidly 
than housing starts and replacements.  This is shown by comparing the beginning and end points 
of lines representing “starts plus replacements” (uppermost solid line in Figure 9A.3.1) and 
“shipments” (diamond linked line in Figure 9A.3.1).  In 1980 the “shipment” line begins below 
the “starts plus replacements” line.  In 2002, the “shipments” line ends above the “starts plus 
replacements” line.  This more rapid increase in shipments, compared to housing starts plus 
replacements, suggests that the appliance per household ratio increased over the study period.  
a Appliance replacements are determined from the expected operating life of refrigerators (19 years), clothes 
washers (14 years), and dishwashers (12 years) and from past shipments.  Replacements are further discussed in 
section 9A.3.

Figure 9-A.3.1  Trends in Appliance Shipment, Housing Starts and 
Replacements 
Economic variables, including price, cost and income, may explain this increase in 
appliances per household. Over the period, appliance prices decreased 40 percent to 50 percent, 
operating costs fell between 33 percent and 72 percent, and median household income rose 16 
percent (Table 9A.3.2).

9-A.4 REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF VARIABLES AFFECTING APPLIANCE 
SHIPMENTS 
Little data is available for estimating the impact of economic variables on the demand for 
appliances. Industry operating cost data is incomplete—appliance energy use data is available 
for only 12 years of the 1980-2002 study period. Industry price data is also incomplete— 
available for only 8 years of the study period for each of the appliances.   
The lack of data suggests that regression analysis can at best evaluate broad data trends, 
utilizing relatively few explanatory variables.  This section begins by describing broad trends 
apparent in the economic and physical household data sets and then specifies a simple regression 
model to measure these trends, making assumptions to minimize the number of explanatory

variables. Finally, results are presented of the regression analysis and the estimate of the price 
elasticity of demand for appliances.  In this section (specifically section 9A.4.5), DOE also 
presents the results of regression analysis performed with more complex models, and used to test 
assumptions made to specify the simple model.  These results support the simple model 
specification, and estimates of the price elasticity of appliance demand measured with that 
model. 
9-A.4.1 Broad Trends 
In this section DOE reviews trends in the physical household and economic data sets and 
posit a simple approach for estimating the price elasticity of appliance demand.  As noted above, 
the physical household variables (starts and appliance replacements), explain most of the 
variability in appliance shipments over the period.b  DOE assumes the rest of the variability in 
shipments (referred to as “residual shipments”) is explained by economic variables, and present a 
tabular method for measuring price elasticities described below.   
To illustrate this tabular approach, DOE defines two new variables—residual shipments 
and total price. Residual shipments are defined as the difference between shipments and 
physical household demand (starts plus replacements). Total price, represented by the following 
equation, is defined as appliance price plus the present value of lifetime appliance operating 
cost:c 
TP = PP + PVOC 
where: 
TP = Total price, 
PP = Appliance purchase price, and 
PVOC = Present value of operating cost. 
Over the study period, residual shipments increase 30 percent for refrigerators, 19 percent for 
clothes washers, and 23 percent for dishwashers in proportion to total shipments.  At the same
time, total prices decline 47 percent, 45 percent and 48 percent for refrigerators, clothes washers, 
and dishwashers, respectively. Assuming that total price explains the entire change in per 
household appliance usage, a rough estimate is calculated of the total price elasticity of demand 
equal to -0.48 for refrigerators, -0.32 for clothes washers and -0.37 for dishwashers (Table 
9A.4.1). 
b A log regression of the form:  Shipments = a + b • Housing Starts + c • Retirements, indicates that these two 
variables explain 89 percent of the variation in refrigerator shipments, 97 percent of the variation in clothes washer
shipments, and 97 percent of the variation in dishwasher shipments. 
c Present value operating cost is calculated assuming a 19 year operating life for refrigerators, 14 year operating life 
for clothes washers, and a 12 year operating life for dishwashers.  A 37 percent discount rate is used to sum annual 
operating costs into a present value operating cost.

Household income rose during the study period, making it easier for households to 
purchase appliances.  Assuming that a rise in income has a similar impact on shipments as a 
decline in price, the impact of income is incorporated by defining a third variable, termed 
relative price, calculated as total price divided by household income and represented by the 
following equation:d 
RP = 
Income 
TP 
where: 
RP = Relative price, 
TP = Total price, and 
Income = Household income. 
d Recall that the income elasticity of demand cited in the literature review is 0.50 and the price elasticity of demand
cited in the review averages -0.35.  This suggests that combining the effects of income and price will yield an 
elasticity less negative than price elasticity alone.

The percent decline in relative price for the three appliances divided by the percent decline in 
residual shipments suggests a rough estimate of relative price elasticity equal to -0.40 for 
refrigerators, -0.26 for clothes washers and -0.30 for dishwashers (Table 9A.4.2).

9-A.4.2 Model Specification 
The limited price data suggests using a simple regression model to estimate the impact of 
economic variables on shipments, using few explanatory variables.  The following equation 
chosen for this analysis includes one physical household variable (starts plus replacements) and 
one relative price variable (the sum of purchase price plus operating cost, divided by income).  
Ship = a + b × RP + c × [Starts + Rplc] Eq. 9A.1
where: 
Ship = Quantity of appliance sold, 
RP = Relative price, 
Starts = Number of new homes, and 
Rplc = Number of appliances at the end of their operating life. 
The natural logs are taken of all variables so that the estimated coefficients for each 
variable in the model may be interpreted as the percent change in shipments associated with the 
percent change in the variable.  Thus, the coefficient b in this model is interpreted as the relative
price elasticity of demand for the three appliances.   
The following combined regression equation is used to estimate an average price 
elasticity of demand across the three appliances, using pooled data in a single regression.  A 
combined regression specification is justified, given limited data availability and similarity in 
price and shipment behavior across appliances (see Figure 9A.4.1).  Thus, the model represented 
by the combined regression equation is considered the basic model in DOE’s analysis of 
appliance shipments. 
Ship = a + b × RP + c × [Starts + Rplc]+ d × CW + e × DW Eq. 9A.2
where: 
CW = Quantity of clothes washers sold, and  
DW = Quantify of dishwashers sold.

9-A.4.3 Model Discussion 
The most important assumption used to specify this model is that changes in economic 
variables over the study period—income, price, and operating cost—are responsible for all 
observed growth in residual appliance shipments.  In other words, DOE assumes other possible 
explanations, such as changing consumer preferences and increases in the quality of 
appliances—had no impact. This assumption seems unlikely but without additional data, the 
impact of this assumption on the price elasticity of demand cannot be measured. DOE effectively 
assumes that changes in consumer preferences and appliance characteristics, while affecting 
which specific models are purchased, have relatively little impact on the total number of
appliances purchased in a year. 
Three additional assumptions used to specify this model deserve comment.  The relative
price variable is specified in the model, assuming that (1) the correct implicit discount rate is 
used to combine appliance price and operating cost and that (2) rising income has the same
impact on shipments as falling total price.  The “starts + replacements” variable is specified, 
assuming (3) that starts and replacements have similar impacts on shipments.   
To investigate the first assumption about discount rates, DOE calculated “present value 
operating cost” using a 20 percent implicit discount rate and performed a second regression 
analysis based on the models described in equations. 9A.1 and 9A.2.  The results of this analysis, 
presented in section 9A.4.5, indicate that the elasticity of relative price is relatively insensitive to 
changes in the discount rate. 
To investigate the second and third assumptions, DOE specified a regression model 
separating income from total price and replacements from starts, thus adding two additional 
explanatory variables to the basic model as shown in the following equation: 
Ship = a + b ×TP + c × Incone + d × Start + e × Rplc + f × CW + g × DW Eq. 9A.3
The results of the regression analysis of this model are also presented in section 9A.4.5.  
These results suggest that the elasticity of total price (coefficient b) is relatively insensitive to 
changes in the treatment of income and “starts + replacements” in the model.  
9-A.4.4 Analysis Results 
9A.4.4.1 Individual Appliance Model 
The individual appliance regression equations are specified as followed (as shown earlier 
as Eq. 9A.1): 
Ship = a + b × RP + c × [Starts + Rplc] 
In regression analysis of this model, the elasticity of relative price (b) is estimated to be

-0.40 for refrigerators, -0.31 for clothes washers and -0.32 for dishwashers (Table 9A.4.3), 
averaging -0.35.  These elasticities are similar to those reported in the literature survey for 
appliances (Table 9A.2.1).  They are remarkably similar to the price elasticity calculated using a 
tabular approach presented above (Table 9A.4.2).    
The estimated coefficient associated with the “starts + replacements” variable is close to 
one. A coefficient equal to one for this variable would imply that shipments increase in direct 
proportion to an increase in “starts + replacements”, holding economic variables constant.  The 
high R squared values (above 95) and t statistics (above 5) in the results provide a measure of 
confidence in this analysis, despite the very small data set.

The combined appliance regression equation is specified as follows (as shown earlier as 
Eq. 9A.2): 
Ship = a + b × RP + c × [Starts + Rplc]+ d × CW + e × DW 
This regression analysis indicates that the model fits the existing shipments data well 
(high R squared) and that the variables included in the model are statistically significant (Table 
9A.4.4). The elasticity of relative price estimated with this model is -0.34, close to the average 
value estimated in the individual appliance models (-0.35).  It is also similar to elasticity 
estimates reported in the literature survey and calculated using the tabular approach above.

9-A.4.5 Additional Regression Specifications and Results 
As described above in section 9A.4.3, DOE used three assumptions to specify its 
appliance models.  The first is that the implicit price variable in the basic regression model is 
specified using a 37 percent implicit discount rate, to aggregate appliance price and operating 
cost. The second states that the implicit price variable is defined assuming that rising income has 
the same impact on shipments as falling total price.  The third states that the “starts + 
replacements” variable is defined assuming that housing starts have a similar impact on 
shipments as appliance replacements.     
9A.4.5.1 Lower Consumer Discount Rate 
To investigate the first assumption about discount rates, DOE calculated “present value 
operating cost” using a 20 percent implicit discount rate and performed a second regression 
analysis based on the models described in equations 9A.1 and 9A.2.  The estimated coefficient 
associated with the relative price variable in these regressions is almost identical to the 
coefficients estimated for same variable reported above using a 37 percent implicit discount rate.   
The elasticity of relative price calculated using a 20 percent discount rate is -0.33 in the 
combined regression and averages -0.35 for the three appliances (Table 9A.4.5).  The elasticity 
of price calculated using a 37 percent discount rate is -0.34 in the combined regression and 
averages -0.35 for the three appliances.  DOE concludes from this analysis that the elasticity of 
relative price is relatively insensitive to changes in the discount rate.

9A.4.5.2 Disaggregated Variables 
To investigate the second and third assumptions, DOE constructed a regression model 
separating income from total price and replacements from starts, thus adding two additional 
explanatory variables to the basic model (as shown earlier as Eq. 9A.3).

Ship = a + b ×TP + c × Incone + d × Start + e × Rplc + f × CW + g × DW 
The estimated coefficient associated with the total price variable in these regressions is 
almost identical to the coefficients estimated for the relative price variable reported above. The 
elasticity of total price in the above equation is -0.36 in the combined appliance regression and 
averages -0.35 for the three appliances (Table 9A.4.6).  The elasticity of relative price based on 
the model described in equation 9A.2 is -0.34 in the combined regression (Table 9A.4.4) and 
averages -0.35 across the individual appliances (Table 9A.4.3). DOE concludes that the price 
elasticity calculated in this analysis is relatively insensitive to the specification of household 
income and “starts + replacements” variables in the model.

9-A.5 LONG RUN IMPACTS 
As noted above in Table 9A.2.1 in section 9A.2, the literature review provides price 
elasticities over short and long time periods, also referred to as short run and long run price 
elasticities.  As noted in the first two rows of Table 9A.2.1, one source (i.e., Hymans) shows that 
the price elasticity of demand is significantly different over the short run and long run for 
automobiles.1  Because DOE’s forecasts of shipments and national impacts due to standards is 
over a 30-year time period, consideration must be given as to how the relative price elasticity is 
affected once a new standard takes effect.   
DOE considers the relative price elasticities determined above in section 9A.4 to be short 
run elastcities. DOE was unable to identify sources specific to household durable goods, such as 
appliances, to indicate how short run and long run price elasticities differ.  Therefore, to estimate 
how the relative price elasticity changes over time, DOE relied on the Hymans study pertaining 
to automobiles.  Based on the Hymans study, Table 9A.5.1 shows how the automobile price

elasticity of demand changes in the years following a purchase price change.  With increasing 
years after the price change, the price elasticity becomes more inelastic until it reaches a terminal 
value around the tenth year after the price change.

Based on the relative change in the automobile price elasticity of demand shown in Table 
9A.5.1, DOE developed a time series of relative price elasticities for home appliances.  Table 
9A.5.2 presents the time series.

9-A.6 SUMMARY 
This appendix describes the results of a literature search, tabular analysis and regression 
analysis of the impact of price and other variables on appliance shipments.  In the literature, 
DOE finds only a few studies of appliance markets that are relevant to this analysis, and no 
studies using time series price and shipments data after 1980.  The information that can be 
summarized from the literature, suggests that the demand for appliances is price inelastic.  Other 
information in the literature suggests that appliances are a normal good, such that rising incomes 
increase the demand for appliances.  Finally, the literature suggests that consumers use relatively 
high implicit discount rates, when comparing appliance prices and appliance operating costs.  
There is not enough price and operating cost data available to perform complex analysis 
of dynamic changes in the appliance market.  In this analysis, DOE uses data available for 
refrigerators, clothes washers and dishwashers to evaluate broad market trends and to perform
simple regression analysis.   
These data indicate that there has been a rise in appliance shipments and a decline in 
appliance price and operating cost over the period.  Household income has also risen during this 
time. To simplify the analysis, DOE combined the available economic information into one

variable, termed relative price, and used this variable in a tabular analysis of market trends, and a 
regression analysis. 
DOE’s tabular analysis of trends in the number of appliances per household suggests that 
the price elasticity of demand for the three appliances is inelastic. Our regression analysis of 
these same variables suggests that the relative price elasticity of demand is -0.34.  The price 
elasticity is consistent with estimates in the literature.  Nevertheless, DOE stresses that the 
measure is based on a small data set, using very simple statistical analysis.  More important, the 
measure is based on an assumption that economic variables, including price, income and 
operating costs, explain most of the trend in appliances per household in the United States since 
1980. Changes in appliance quality and consumer preferences may have occurred during this 
period, but they are not accounted for in this analysis.   
9-A.7 DATA USED IN THE ANALYSIS 
•  Appliance Shipments: Shipments are defined as the annual number of units shipped in 
millions.  These data were collected from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 
(AHAM)8 and Appliance Magazine9 as annual values for each year, 1980–2002.  AHAM 
was used for the period 1989–2002 while Appliance Magazine was used for the period 1980– 
1988.
•  Appliance Price: Price is defined as the shipments weighted retail sales price of the unit in 
1999 dollars. Price values for 1980, 1985, 1986, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1998, and 2002 were 
collected from AHAM Fact Books.10  Price values for other years were interpolated from
these eight years of data.
•  Housing Starts: Housing starts data were collected from U.S. Census construction statistics 
(C25 reports) as annual values for each year, 1980–2002.11 
•  Replacements: Retirement-driven replacements are estimated with the assumption that some
fraction of sales arise from consumers replacing equipment at the end of its useful life.  Since 
each appliance has a different expected lifespan (19 years for refrigerators12, 14 years for 
clothes washers13, 12 years for dishwashers14), replacements are calculated differently for 
each appliance type.  Replacements are estimated as the average of shipments 14–24 years 
previous for refrigerators, 9–19 years previous for clothes washers, and 7–17 years previous 
for dishwashers. Historical shipments data were collected from AHAM and Appliance 
Magazine.
•  Annual Electricity Consumption: Electricity Use (UEC) is defined as the energy 
consumption of the unit in kilowatt-hours. Electricity consumption is dependent on appliance 
capacity and efficiency. These data were provided by AHAM for 1980, 1990–1997 and 
1999–2002.15  Data were interpolated in the years for which data were not available.
9-A-13  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Operating Cost: Operating Cost is the present value of the electricity consumption of an 
appliance over its expected lifespan.  The lifespans of refrigerators, clothes washers and 
dishwashers are assumed to be 19, 14, and 12 years respectively.  Discount rates of 20 
percent6 and 37 percent16 were used, producing similar estimates of price elasticity.  A study 
by Hausman recommended a discount rate of “about 20 percent” in its introduction, and 
presented results ranging from 24.1 percent to 29 percent based on his calculations for room
air conditioners. A study by Train suggests a range of implicit discount rates averaging 35 
percent for appliances.
• Income: Median annual household income in 2003 dollars.  This data was collected for each 
year, 1980–2002, from Table H-6 of the U.S. Census.17

CHAPTER 10.  NATIONAL IMPACT ANALYSIS  
10.1 INTRODUCTION  
This chapter describes the method the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) used to 
estimate the national impacts of candidate standard levels for residential refrigeration products. 
DOE evaluated the following impacts: (1) national energy savings (NES) attributable to each 
possible standard, (2) monetary value of those energy savings to consumers of the considered 
products, (3) increased total installed cost of the products because of standards, and (4) net 
present value (NPV) of energy savings (the difference between the value of energy savings and 
increased total installed cost).   
DOE determined both the NES and NPV for all the efficiency levels considered for new 
standards for residential refrigeration products. DOE performed all calculations for each 
considered product using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet model, which is accessible on the 
Internet. <www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/> The spreadsheets, which 
implement the National Impact Analysis (NIA) model, combine the calculations for determining 
the NES and NPV for each considered product with input from the appropriate shipments model. 
Details and instructions for using the NIA model are provided in appendix 10-A.   
Chapter 9 provides a detailed description of the shipments models that DOE used to 
forecast future purchases of the considered products. Chapter 9 includes detailed descriptions of 
consumers’ sensitivities to total installed cost, operating cost, and income, and how DOE 
captured those sensitivities within the model.  
Throughout its analysis, DOE studied seven product classes in detail. For the National 
Impact Analysis, each of these classes represents a product category which also contains other 
product classes. DOE assigned each of the twenty product classes to one of these seven product 
categories. The following list indicates which product classes are associated with each product 
category: 
•  Top-mount refrigerator-freezers: product classes 1, 1A, 2, 3, 3A, and 6; represented 
by product class 3. 
•  Bottom-mount refrigerator-freezers: product classes 5 and 5A; represented by product 
class 5. 
•  Side-by-side refrigerator-freezers: product classes 4 and 7; represented by product 
class 7. 
•  Upright freezers: product class 9 only. 
•  Chest freezers: product classes 8a, 10, and 10A; represented by product class 10. 
a Product class 8, “upright freezers with manual defrost” is analyzed as part of the “chest freezer” category because 
products in this class are much more technologically similar to chest freezers. 
10-1  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Compact refrigerators: product classes 11, 11A, 12, 13, 13A, 14, and 15; represented 
by product class 11. 
•  Compact freezers: product classes 16, 17, and 18; represented by product class 18. 
To estimate the national impacts of new standards for all the product classes considered 
in this rulemaking, DOE allocated the product cost and annual energy consumption of each 
representative product class to all product classes within its category.  
10.2 FORECASTED EFFICIENCIES FOR BASE AND STANDARDS CASES
This section describes the method DOE used to forecast the energy efficiencies of 
considered products under the base case and each of the potential standards cases. It provides 
efficiency distributions for all product classes of standard-size refrigerator-freezers, standard-size 
freezers, and compact refrigerators and freezers. 
10.2.1 Method and Assumptions 
A key factor in estimating NES and NPV is the trend in energy efficiency forecasted for 
the base case (without new standards) and each of the standards cases. In calculating the NES, 
per-unit annual energy consumption is a direct function of product efficiency. For the NPV, two 
inputs, the per-unit total installed cost and the per-unit annual operating cost, depend on 
efficiency. The first input, the per-unit total installed cost, is a direct function of efficiency. The 
per-unit annual operating cost, because it is a function of the per-unit annual consumption, is 
indirectly dependent on product efficiency. 
For each product class considered for new standards, DOE determined the distribution of 
product efficiencies in the marketplace in 2007 based on data submitted by the Association of 
Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM).1 Using the 2007 efficiency distribution as a starting 
point, DOE developed a base-case efficiency distribution based on certain assumptions regarding 
future trends. DOE assumed that increases in efficiency are driven largely by the ENERGY 
STAR program and the consumer incentives available for ENERGY STAR appliances. DOE 
evaluated the historical trends in energy use by refrigeration products, as reported in the AHAM 
Fact Book 20052 (as well as data provided by AHAM for 2006 and 20071). Based on the AHAM 
information, DOE concluded that the roughly constant energy use per appliance observed 
between 2001 and 2007 reflected the growing market share for larger appliances and product 
classes that use more energy, such as side-mount refrigerator-freezers, balanced by an increasing 
market share for ENERGY STAR appliances.  
The requirements for meeting ENERGY STAR qualification were changed on April 1, 
2008, for standard-size refrigerator-freezers, but remained the same for standard-size freezers 
and compact products.3 DOE assumed that the market for standard-size refrigerators will shift 
toward greater efficiency between 2007 and 2014 (the assumed effective date of a new standard) 
10-2

in response to the change in ENERGY STAR requirements. In particular, DOE assumed (for all 
product classes) that the percentage of shipments that meet the new ENERGY STAR criteria will 
be the same in 2014 as it was in 2007. For standard-size freezers and all compact products, DOE 
assumed no change in the distribution of efficiencies before 2014. For standard-size refrigerator-
freezers, DOE assumed that the market share of products that qualified for the ENERGY STAR 
label in 2007 but could not meet the 2008 criteria, gradually will shift to meet the new criteria, 
resulting in the same market share for ENERGY STAR refrigeration products in 2014 as in 
2007. For product class 3, for example, the ENERGY STAR market share in 2007 was 13.4 
percent. The assumed market share in 2014 (under the new criteria) also is 13.4 percent (see 
Table 10.2.1). 
Base case. For the base-case scenario, DOE assumed that the ENERGY STAR 
requirements for all product classes will become more stringent in 2014 than in 2008, if there 
were no revised standards. This assumption reflects the view that, in the absence of DOE 
standards, the ENERGY STAR program (and or other federal or State programs) would feel 
compelled to increase promotion of higher-efficiency refrigeration products. DOE assumed that 
energy use by ENERGY STAR products would be required to be 25 percent, rather than 20 
percent, lower than the standard for standard-size refrigerator-freezers and compact products, 
and 15 percent, rather than 10 percent lower for standard-size freezers. DOE then assumed that 
the ENERGY STAR market shares in 2021, under the new qualification criteria, would equal the 
ENERGY STAR market shares in 2007. Finally, DOE assumed that the efficiency distributions 
would be fixed from 2021 until the end of the forecast period (30 years after the assumed 
effective date of 2014). 
Table 10.2.1 shows the market shares of product efficiencies that DOE projected for 
standard-size refrigerator-freezers in 2007, 2014, and 2021. The table also lists the shipment-
weighted energy use factor (SWEUF) for each product class for those years. The distributions for 
product classes of freezers and compact models are not projected to change between 2007 and 
2014, but are projected to change between 2014 and 2021 in response to assumed ENERGY 
STAR requirements (Tables 10.2.2 and 10.2.3).

Standards cases. To determine efficiency distributions for cases in which a candidate 
standard applies, DOE used a “roll-up + market shift” scenario for 2014, the year that revised 
standards are assumed to become effective, and subsequent years. DOE assumed that product 
efficiencies in the base case that did not meet the standard under consideration would roll up to 
meet the new standard in 2014.  
DOE further assumed that revised standards would result in a market shift such that
market shares of products with efficiency better than the standard would gradually increase. In 
keeping with the perspective of the base case scenario that energy efficiency will be a policy 
priority, DOE assumed that the ENERGY STAR program will continue to promote efficient 
appliances after revised standards are introduced in 2014. For a standard that calls for an energy 
use factor of 0.9 (a 10-percent reduction in energy use from the current standard) for standard-
size refrigerator-freezers, DOE assumed that the ENERGY STAR requirement would remain 20 
percent better than the standard. For all other standard levels for standard-size refrigerator-
freezers other than the maximum-efficiency level, DOE assumed that the ENERGY STAR 
program would use a threshold of 15 percent better than the standard, because it might be 
difficult to achieve 20 percent better than the standard at the new, higher efficiency levels. For all 
standard levels other than the maximum-efficiency level, DOE assumed that the ENERGY 
STAR program would use a threshold of 10 percent better than the standard for standard-size 
freezers, and 20 percent better than the standard for compact refrigeration products. Those levels 
correspond to the current ENERGY STAR requirements (relative to the standard).  
Using the above criteria, DOE assumed that from 2014 to 2021 the market share of 
ENERGY STAR appliances for each product category would grow linearly until it reached the 
level obtained in 2007. DOE assumed that after 2021 the percentage of shipments at each 
efficiency level would remain fixed at the 2021 values.

Figure 10.2.1 is a graphical representation of DOE’s approach. The figure shows a plot of 
the shipment-weighted energy use factor for product class 7 (representative of all side-by-side 
refrigerator-freezers) for the base case and each candidate standard level. Some units in each 
year exceed the standard level in all cases except candidate standard level 7, which represents the 
maximum-efficiency case. Similar figures could be created for every product class.

10.3 NATIONAL ENERGY SAVINGS 
DOE calculated the national energy savings associated with the difference between the 
base case and the case associated with each potential standard for the refrigeration products

considered herein. DOE calculated cumulative energy savings throughout the forecast period, 
which extends from 2014 to 2044. 
10.3.1 Definition 
The following equation shows that DOE calculated annual national energy savings (NES) 
as the difference between two projections: a base case (without new standards) and a standards 
case. Positive values of NES represent energy savings (that is, national annual energy 
consumption (AEC) under a standard is less than in the base case). 
_NESy = AEC AECBASE STD 
Cumulative energy savings are the sum of annual national energy savings throughout the 
forecast period, which extends from the assumed effective date of new standards (2014) to 30 
years after that date (2044). The calculation is represented by the following equation. 
NEScum = 䌥NES y 
DOE calculated the national annual energy consumption by multiplying the number or stock of 
each product class (by vintage) by its unit energy consumption (UEC; also by vintage). The 
calculation of national annual energy consumption is represented by the following equation. 
AEC y  ¦ STOCKV uUECV 
DOE defined the quantities for the above expressions as follows. 
AEC = national annual energy consumption each year in quadrillion British thermal units 
(quads), summed over vintages of the product stock, STOCKV; 
NES = annual national energy savings (quads); 
STOCKV = stock of product (millions of units) of vintage V that survive in the year for which 
DOE calculated annual energy consumption; 
UECV = annual energy consumption per product in kilowatt hours (kWh) [electricity 
consumption is converted from site energy to source energy (quads) by applying a 
time-dependent conversion factor]; 
V = year in which the product was purchased as a new unit; and  
y = year in the forecast. 
The stock of a product depends on annual shipments and the lifetime of the product. As 
described in chapter 9, DOE projected product shipments under the base case and standards 
cases. DOE projected that shipments under the standards cases would be slightly lower than 
under the base case, because of the higher purchase cost of more efficient products. In other 
words, DOE believes that the higher purchase cost would cause some consumers to forego 
purchasing new products.

To avoid including savings attributable to shipments displaced because of standards, 
DOE used the projected standards-case shipments and, in turn, the standards-case stock, to 
calculate the annual energy consumption for the base case.   
10.3.2 Inputs 
The inputs to the calculation of national energy savings (NES) are: 
• Shipments; 
• product stock (STOCKV); 
• annual energy consumption per unit (UEC);
• national annual energy consumption (AEC); and 
• site-to-source conversion factor (src_conv). 
10.3.2.1 Shipments 
DOE forecasted shipments of each considered product class under the base case and all 
standards cases. Several factors affect forecasted shipments, including purchase cost, operating 
cost, and household income. As noted earlier, the increased cost of more efficient products 
causes some consumers to forego buying the products. Consequently, shipments forecasted 
under the standards cases are lower than under the base case. The method DOE used to calculate 
and generate the shipments forecasts for each considered product class is described in detail in 
Chapter 9, Shipments Analysis. 
10.3.2.2 Equipment Stock 
The equipment stock in a given year is the number of products shipped from earlier years 
that survive in that year. The NIA model tracks the number of the number of units shipped each 
year. DOE assumes that products have an increasing probability of retiring as they age. The 
probability of survival as a function of years since purchase is the survival function. Chapter 9 
provides additional details on the survival functions that DOE used for each product.
10.3.2.3 Annual Energy Consumption per Unit 
DOE used the shipment-weighted energy use factors (SWEUFs) presented in section 10.2 
for the base case and standards cases, along with the data on annual energy consumption 
presented in chapters 7 and 8, to estimate the shipment-weighted average annual per-unit energy 
consumption under the base and standards cases. The average annual per-unit energy 
consumption projected for 2014 for each product category is shown in Tables 10.3.1 through 
10.3.3.

10.3.2.4 National Annual Energy Consumption 
The national annual energy consumption (AEC) is the product of the annual energy 
consumption per unit and the number of units of each vintage. This method of calculation 
accounts for differences in unit energy consumption from year to year. The equation for 
determining the annual energy consumption, which was presented in section 10.3.1, is repeated 
here. 
AEC = 䌥STOCKV ×UECV 
In determining national annual energy consumption, DOE first calculated annual energy 
consumption at the site, then applied a conversion factor, described below, to calculate primary 
energy consumption.  
10.3.2.5 Site-to-Source Conversion Factors 
In determining national annual energy consumption, DOE initially calculated the annual 
energy consumption at the site (for electricity, the energy in kWh consumed at the household or 
establishment). It then used site energy consumption to calculate primary (source) energy 
consumption by applying a conversion factor to account for losses associated with the 
generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. The site-to-source conversion factor is a 
multiplicative factor used to convert site energy consumption into primary or source energy 
consumption, expressed in quads (quadrillion Btus). DOE used annual site-to-source conversion 
factors based on the version of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS)b that corresponds
to EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2008 (AEO 2008).4 The factors are marginal values, which 
represent the response of the system to an incremental decrease in consumption. For electricity, 
the conversion factors change over time in response to projected changes in generation sources 
(i.e., the types of power plants projected to provide electricity to the Nation). Figure 10.3.1 
shows the site-to-source conversion factors from 2005 to the end of the forecast period. DOE 
assumed that conversion factors remain at 2030 values throughout the rest of the forecast.

10.4 NET PRESENT VALUE 
DOE calculated the net present value (NPV) of the increased product cost and reduced 
operating cost associated with the difference between the base case and each potential standards 
case for the considered refrigeration products. 
10.4.1 Definition 
The NPV is the value in the present of a time-series of costs and savings. The NPV is 
described by the equation: 
_NPV = PVS PVC 
Where: 
PVS = present value of savings in operating cost, and  
PVC = present value of increased total product cost to consumers.  
10-18  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
DOE determined the PVS and PVC according to the following expressions. 
PVS = 䌥OCSy × DFy 
PVC = 䌥TICy × DFy 
Where: 
OCS = total annual savings in operating cost each year summed over vintages of the product 
stock, STOCKV; 
TIC = total annual increases in product cost each year summed over years of the product 
shipments, SHIPy; 
DF = discount factor in each year; and  
y = year in the forecast. 
DOE calculated the total annual consumer savings in operating cost by multiplying the 
number or stock of a given product class (by vintage) by its per-unit operating cost savings (also 
by vintage). DOE calculated the total annual increases in consumer product cost by multiplying 
the number or shipments of the given product class (by vintage) by its per-unit increase in 
consumer product cost (also by vintage). The calculation of total annual operating cost savings 
and total annual product cost increases is represented by the following equations. 
OCS y = 䌥STOCKV ×UOCSV 
TIC y   䌥SHIPy uUTIC y 
Where: 
STOCKV = stock of products of vintage V that survive in the year for which DOE calculated 
annual energy consumption, 
UOCSV = annual per-unit savings in operating cost, 
V = year in which the product was purchased as a new unit, 
SHIPy = shipments of products in year y, and 
UTICy = annual per-unit increase in installed product cost in year y. 
DOE determined the total increased product cost for each year from the effective date of
a potential standard to 2044. It determined the present value of operating cost savings for each 
year from the effective date of the standard to the year when all units purchased by 2044 have 
been retired. DOE calculated costs and savings as the difference between a standards case and a 
base case without new standards. 
10-19  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
DOE developed a discount factor from the national discount rate and the number of years 
between the present (i.e., year to which the sum is being discounted) and the year in which the 
costs and savings occur. The NPV is the sum over time of the discounted net savings. 
10.4.2 Inputs 
The inputs to calculation of the net present value (NPV) are:  
• Average annual product cost; 
• average annual savings in operating cost,; 
• total annual increases in product cost; 
• total annual savings in operating cost; 
• discount factor; 
• present value of costs; and 
• present value of savings. 
The increase in total annual product cost is equal to the annual change in the average 
annual product cost (difference between base case and standards case) multiplied by the 
shipments forecasted in the standards case. As with the calculation of the NES, DOE did not 
calculate total annual product costs using base-case shipments. To avoid including savings due to 
displaced shipments (by consumers deciding not to buy higher-cost products), DOE used the 
standards-case projection of shipments and, in turn, the standards-case stock, to calculate product 
costs. 
The total annual savings in operating cost are equal to the change in annual operating cost 
(difference between base case and standards case) per unit multiplied by the shipments 
forecasted in the standards case. 
10.4.2.1 Average Annual Product Cost 
The average annual product cost is directly dependent on efficiency. DOE therefore used 
the SWEUFs presented in section 10.2 for the base case and each standards case, along with the 
product costs at various efficiency levels (presented in chapter 8), to estimate the shipment-
weighted average annual product cost under the base and standards cases. Tables 10.4.1 through 
10.4.3 show the shipment-weighted average consumer product cost based on the SWEUFs that 
correspond to the base case and each standards case in 2014.

10.4.2.2 Annual Operating Cost Savings per Unit 
The average annual operating cost includes the costs for energy, repair, and maintenance. 
As described in chapter 8, for all the considered products DOE assumed that potential standards 
10-21 
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would produce no increase in maintenance or repair costs. For all the considered products, 
therefore, DOE determined the per-unit annual savings in operating cost based only on the 
savings in energy costs attributable to a standard. DOE determined the per-unit annual savings in 
operating cost by multiplying the per-unit annual savings in energy consumption developed for 
each product class by the appropriate energy price. As described in chapter 8, DOE forecasted 
energy prices based on EIA’s AEO 2009.5 
10.4.2.3 Total Annual Increases in Product Cost  
The total annual increase in product cost for any given standards case is the product of 
the average cost increase per unit due to the standard and the number of units of each vintage 
shipped. This method accounts for differences in product cost from year to year. The equation 
for determining the total annual increase in product cost for a given standards case, which was 
shown in section 10.4.1, is repeated here.  
TIC   䌥SHIP uUTICy y y 
10.4.2.4 Total Annual Savings in Operating Cost  
The total annual savings in operating cost for any given standards case is the product of 
the annual savings in operating cost per unit attributable to the standard and the number of units 
of each vintage. This method accounts for differences in annual savings in operating cost from
year to year. The equation for determining the total annual savings in operating cost for a given 
standards case, which was presented in section 10.4.1, is repeated here.  
OCS = 䌥STOCKV ×UOCSV 
10.4.2.5 Discount Factor 
DOE multiplied monetary values in future years by a discount factor to determine the 
present value. The discount factor (DF) is described by the equation: 
1
DF = _( y yp )(1+ r ) 
Where: 
r = discount rate,  
y = year in which the monetary value exists, and   
yP = year in which the present value is being determined.  
Although DOE used consumer discount rates to determine the life-cycle cost of 
refrigeration products (chapter 8), it used national discount rates to calculate national NPV. DOE 
estimated NPV using both a 3-percent and a 7-percent real discount rate, in accordance with the 
10-22  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Office of Management and Budget’s guidance to Federal agencies on the development of 
regulatory analysis, particularly section E therein: Identifying and Measuring Benefits and 
Costs.6 DOE defined the present year as 2009. 
10.4.2.6 Present Value of Costs
The present value of increased product costs is the annual total cost increase in each year 
(the difference between a standards case and the base case), discounted to the present and 
summed throughout the period in which DOE is considering the installation of products (that is, 
from the effective date of standards, 2014, to 2044). DOE calculated annual increases in installed 
cost as the difference in total product cost for new appliances purchased each year, multiplied by 
the shipments in the standards case. 
10.4.2.7 Present Value of Savings 
The present value of savings in operating cost is the annual savings on operating cost (the 
difference between the base case and a standards case), discounted to the present and summed 
from the effective date to the time when the last unit installed by 2044 is retired from service. 
Savings are decreases in operating cost associated with the higher energy efficiency of products 
purchased in the standards case compared to the base case. Total annual savings in operating cost 
are the savings per unit multiplied by the number of units of each vintage that survive in a 
particular year. 
10.5 RESULTS OF NES AND NPV CALCULATIONS 
The National Impact Analysis (NIA) model produces estimates of the NES and NPV 
attributable to a given candidate standard level. The inputs to the NIA model were discussed in 
sections 10.3.2 (inputs to NES ) and 10.4.2 (inputs to NPV). DOE generated the NES and NPV 
results using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which is accessible on the Internet 
<www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/> Details regarding and instructions for 
using the spreadsheet are provided in appendix 10-A. 
10.5.1 Summary of Inputs 
Table 10.5.1 summarizes the inputs to the NIA model. A brief description of the data is

10.5.2 Results of National Energy Savings Calculations  
The following sections provide results of calculating NES for the efficiency levels 
analyzed for the considered products. NES results, which are cumulative from 2014 to 2044, are 
primary energy savings. DOE based the inputs to the NIA model on weighted-average values, 
yielding results that are discrete point values, rather than a distribution of values as in the life-
cycle cost and payback period analyses. The results in Tables 10.5.2 through 10.5.7 represent all 
the product classes that DOE included in each of the seven representative product categories, not 
only the primary product class that accounts for the bulk of shipments in each category.

10.5.3 Annual Costs and Savings 
Figure 10.5.1 illustrates the basic inputs to the calculation of net present value (NPV) by 
showing the non-discounted annual increases in product cost and annual savings in operating 
cost at the national level for efficiency level 3 for product class 3 (refrigerator-freezers– 
automatic defrost with top-mounted freezer and without through-the-door ice service). The figure 
also shows the net savings, which is the difference between the savings and costs for each year. 
The annual increase in product cost is the total cost for products purchased each year in the 
forecast period. The annual savings in operating cost applies to products operating in each year. 
The NPV is the difference between the cumulative annual discounted savings and cumulative

annual discounted costs. DOE could create figures like Figure 10.5.1 for each of the considered 
efficiency levels for each product class.

10.5.4 Results of Net Present Value Calculations 
This section provides results of calculating net present value (NPV) for the potential 
efficiency standards for the considered refrigeration product classes. Results, which are 
cumulative, are shown as the discounted value of the savings in dollar terms. Results are 
provided for each potential efficiency standard. DOE based the inputs to the NIA model on 
weighted-average values, yielding results that are discrete point values, rather than a distribution 
of values as in the life-cycle cost and payback period analysis. 
The present value of increased total installed cost is the total annual increase in installed 
cost (the difference between the standards case and base case), discounted to the present and 
summed throughout the period for which DOE evaluated the impact of standards. 
Savings are decreases in operating cost associated with the higher energy efficiency of 
products purchased in the standards case compared to the base case. Total savings in operating

cost are the savings per unit multiplied by the number of units of each vintage (i.e., year of 
manufacture) that survive in a particular year. For units purchased by 2044, the operating cost 
includes energy consumed until the last unit is retired from service.  
Tables 10.5.8 though 10.5.10 show the NPV associated with the potential standards for 
the considered refrigeration products. Detailed results showing the breakdown of the NPV into 
national installed product cost and operating cost savings are provided in appendix 10-B. As was 
the case with NES results, the results for NPV refer to all the product classes that DOE included 
in each of the seven representative product class categories, not simply to the primary product 
class that accounts for the bulk of shipments in each case.

at: http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/. 
There are a total of four NIA spreadsheets, one each for the following product types: 
standard-size refrigerator-freezers, standard-size freezers, compact refrigerators, and commercial 
compact freezers.  The four spreadsheets posted on the DOE website represent the latest versions 
and have been tested with Microsoft Excel 2003.  
To execute the spreadsheet requires Microsoft Excel 2003 or a later version. The NIA 
spreadsheet performs calculations to forecast the change in national energy use and net present 
value due to an energy conservation standard. The energy use and associated costs for a given 
standard are determined first by calculating the shipments and then calculating the energy use 
and costs for all equipment shipped under that standard. The differences between the standards 
and base cases can then be compared and the overall energy savings and present values 
determined.  
10-A.1.1 Standard-Size Refrigerator-Freezers

following worksheets: 
Input and Summary Contains user input selections under “User Inputs” and a summary 
table, Cumulative Energy Savings and NPV for the selected 
standard level efficiency distribution. The sheet contains the 
efficiency levels being considered for standard-size refrigerator-
freezers and the associated incremental prices.  This sheet also
contains base and standards case efficiency trends for standard-size 
refrigerator-freezers, and efficiency weighted average energy use 
and equipment price for the base and standards cases.

APPENDIX 10-B. NATIONAL EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING COSTS
10-B.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this appendix, the Department presents the components of the net present value (NPV), 
namely, the present value of the equipment (or total installed costs) and the present value of the 
operating costs for each of the four residential refrigerator-freezer product types. The present 
value of equipment costs is also termed the cumulative national equipment costs while the 
present value of operating costs is also termed the cumulative national operating costs. 
As presented in Chapter 10, National Impact Analysis, the NPV is described by the 
equation: 
_NPV = PVS PVC 
where: 
PVS = Present value of operating cost savings (including energy, water, repair, and 
maintenance costs) and 
PVC = Present value of increased total installed costs (including equipment and 
installation).
The PVS and PVC are determined according to the following expressions: 
PVS = 䌥OCSy × DFy 
PVC = 䌥TICy × DFy 
where: 
OCS = Total annual operating cost savings each year summed over vintages of the 
product stock, 
TIC = Total annual installed cost increases each year summed over vintages of the 
product stock,  
DF = Discount factor in each year, and  
y = Year in the forecast (i.e., 2012 to 2042).  
PVS and PVC are determined for each year from the effective date of the standard to the year
when units purchased in 2042 retire. 
The present value of operating costs and the present value of equipment costs (or total 
installed costs) are the components comprising the PVS and PVC, respectively. The PVS is 
10-B-1  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
   
  
 
  
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determined by taking the difference between the present value of operating costs for the base 
case and the present value of operating costs for the standards case. The PVC is determined by 
taking the difference between the present value of equipment costs for the base case and the 
present value of equipment costs for the standards case. 
10-B.2 RESULTS
For following sections provide tables showing the present value of operating costs (also
known as the cumulative national operating costs) and the present value of equipment costs (also 
known as the cumulative national equipment costs) each of the four appliance products.  For 
each product, two sets of results are presented; one based on a seven-percent and another based 
on a three-percent discount rate.  
In the tables provided in the following sections, the national operating and equipment 
costs are presented for the base case (i.e., without standards) and each standard level analyzed. 
Differences between the base case and standards cases are also presented. The difference in the 
national equipment costs represents the PVC or present value of equipment cost increases while 
the difference in the national operating costs represents the PVS or present value of operating 
cost savings. The difference between the base case and standards case total national equipment 
and operating costs represents the NPV. 
10-B.2.1 Standard-Size Refrigerator-Freezers 
Tables 10B.2.1–10B.2.6 present the national equipment and operating costs, PVC, PVS, 
and NPV for standard-size refrigerator-freezers at real discount rates of seven- and three-percent, 
respectively.
All base case values were determined with shipments projections established under the 
standards case. As detailed in Chapter 9, shipments projections under the standards cases were 
determined to be lower than those in the base case projection due to the higher installed cost of 
the more efficient equipment. As a result, DOE used the standards case shipments projection 
and, in turn, the standards case equipment stock, to determine the NPV to avoid the inclusion of 
savings due to displaced shipments. Thus, the base case values shown in Tables 10B.2.1–10B.2.6 
vary with the standards case.  
DOE studied seven three product classes in detail for standard-size refrigerator-freezers. 
For the National Impact Analysis, each of these classes represents a product category which also 
contains other product classes. For standard-size refrigerator-freezers, the following list indicates 
which product classes are associated with each product category: 
•  Top-mount refrigerator-freezers: product classes 1, 1A, 2, 3, 3A, and 6; represented 
by product class 3. 
•  Bottom-mount refrigerator-freezers: product classes 5 and 5A; represented by product 
class 5.

10-B.2.2 Standard-Size Freezers 
Tables 10B.2.7–10B.2.10 present the national equipment and operating costs, PVC, PVS, 
and NPV for standard-size freezers at real discount rates of seven- and three-percent, 
respectively.
All base case values were determined with shipments projections established under the 
standards case. As detailed in Chapter 9, shipments projections under the standards cases were 
determined to be lower than those in the base case projection due to the higher installed cost of 
the more efficient equipment. As a result, DOE used the standards case shipments projection 
and, in turn, the standards case equipment stock, to determine the NPV to avoid the inclusion of 
savings due to displaced shipments. Thus, the base case values shown in Tables 10B.2.7– 
10B.2.10 vary with the standards case.

freezers. For the National Impact Analysis, each of these classes represents a product category 
which also contains other product classes. For standard-size freezers, the following list indicates 
which product classes are associated with each product category: 
• Upright freezers: product class 9 only. 
• Chest freezers: product classes 8a, 10, and 10A; represented by product class 10.

CHAPTER 11. LIFE-CYCLE COST SUBGROUP ANALYSIS  
11.1 INTRODUCTION  
The life-cycle cost (LCC) subgroup analysis evaluates impacts on any identifiable groups 
or customers who may be disproportionately affected by any national energy efficiency standard 
level. The Department of Energy (DOE) will conduct this analysis as one of the analyses for the 
notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR).  DOE will accomplish this, in part, by analyzing the 
LCC and payback periods (PBPs) for those customers that fall into any identifiable groups.  DOE 
plans to evaluate variations in regional energy prices and variations in energy use that might 
affect the net present value of a standard to customer subpopulations.  To the extent possible, 
DOE will obtain estimates of each input parameter’s variability and will consider this variability 
in its calculation of customer impacts.  DOE plans to perform sensitivity analyses to consider 
how differences in energy use will affect subgroups of customers. 
DOE will determine the impact on customer subgroups using the LCC Spreadsheet 
Model, which allows for different data inputs. The standard LCC analysis (described in Chapter 
8) focuses on the households and establishments that use refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and 
freezers. For standard-size refrigerator-freezers and freezers, DOE can use the LCC Spreadsheet 
Models to analyze the LCC for any subgroup by sampling only that subgroup.  (Chapter 8 
explains in detail the inputs to the model used in determining LCC and PBPs.) 
In the case of households that use refrigerator-freezers and freezers, some possible 
subgroups DOE may choose to consider are:  (1) low-income households, and (2) senior citizens.   
In the case of commercial establishments that use compact refrigerators and freezers, small 
businesses are a subgroup that DOE may choose to consider.  If it analyzes small businesses, 
DOE will likely focus on small business subgroups such as lodging establishments.   
11.2 PURCHASE PRICE IMPACTS 
DOE will be especially sensitive to increases in the purchase price of the equipment due 
to new standards, to avoid negative impacts on identifiable population groups that may not be 
able to afford significant increases in equipment price.  For such customers that are sensitive to 
price increases, increases in first costs of a product can preclude the purchase of a new model of 
that product. As a result, some customers may retain products past their useful life.  These older 
products are generally less efficient to begin with, and their efficiency may deteriorate further if 
they are retained beyond their useful life.  Increases in first cost also can preclude the purchase 
and use of a product altogether, resulting in a potentially large loss of utility to the customer.

CHAPTER 12. PRELIMINARY MANUFACTURER IMPACT ANALYSIS 
12.1 INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of the manufacturer impact analysis (MIA) is to identify the likely 
impacts of amended energy conservation standards on manufacturers. The U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) will conduct this analysis with input from manufacturers 
and other interested parties and will apply this methodology to its evaluation of amended 
energy conservation standards for residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and 
freezers. DOE will also consider financial impacts and a wide range of quantitative and 
qualitative industry impacts that might occur following the amendment of an energy 
conservation standard. For example, a particular energy conservation standard level, if
adopted by DOE, could require changes to residential refrigeration products 
manufacturing practices. DOE will identify and come to understand these impacts 
through interviews with manufacturers and other interested parties during the Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) stage of its analysis. 
Recently, DOE announced changes to the MIA format through a report issued to 
Congress on January 31, 2006 (as required by section 141 of the Energy Policy Act of 
2005 (EPACT 2005)), entitled “Energy Conservation Standards Activities.”a Previously, 
DOE did not report any MIA results until the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) 
phase; however, under this new format, DOE has collected, evaluated, and reported 
preliminary information and data during the preliminary phase (the phase preceding the 
NOPR) of this rulemaking. Such preliminary information includes the anticipated 
conversion capital expenditures by efficiency level and the corresponding anticipated 
impacts on jobs. DOE solicited this information during the engineering analysis 
manufacturer interviews and reported the results below. 
12.2 METHODOLOGY 
DOE conducts the MIA in three phases and further tailors the analytical 
framework based on comments from interested parties. In Phase 1, DOE creates an 
industry profile to characterize the industry and conducts a preliminary MIA to identify 
important issues that require consideration. The preliminary technical support document 
(preliminary TSD) presents the results of the Phase 1 analysis. In Phase 2, DOE prepares 
an industry cash-flow model and an interview questionnaire to guide subsequent 
discussions. In Phase 3, DOE interviews manufacturers, and assesses the impacts of 
amended energy conservation standards both quantitatively and qualitatively. Using the 
government regulatory impact model (GRIM), DOE assesses industry and sub-group 
a This report is available on the DOE website at 
www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/2006_schedule_setting.html.

cash flow and NPV. Then, DOE assesses impacts on competition, manufacturing 
capacity, employment, and regulatory burden based on manufacturer interview feedback 
and discussions. The NOPR TSD presents results of the Phase 2 and 3 analyses. 
12.2.1 Phase 1: Industry Profile 
In Phase 1 of the manufacturer impact analysis, DOE collects pertinent qualitative 
and quantitative financial and market information. This includes residential refrigerator, 
refrigerator-freezer, and freezer manufacturer market share, corporate operating ratios,
wages, employment, and production cost ratios. Sources of information may include 
reports published by industry groups, trade journals, the U.S. Census Bureau, copies of 
Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) 10-K filings, and interviews with manufacturers. 
DOE also relies on information from its market and technology assessment, engineering 
analysis, life-cycle cost analysis, markup analysis, and analysis of capital expenditure 
requirements and other data submitted by AHAM to determine the product prices to
characterize the residential refrigeration product industry. 
12.2.2 Phase 2: Industry Cash-Flow Analysis and Interview Guide 
In Phase 2, DOE will perform a preliminary industry cash-flow analysis and 
prepare written guidelines for interviewing manufacturers. 
12.2.2.1 Industry Cash-Flow Analysis 
DOE uses the GRIM to analyze the financial impacts of amended energy 
conservation standards on the residential refrigeration products industries. Standards will 
likely require additional investment, raise production costs, and affect revenue through 
higher prices and, possibly, lower sales. The GRIM uses several factors to determine a 
series of annual cash flows for the year standards become effective and for several years 
after implementation. These factors include annual expected revenues, costs of sales, 
selling and general administration costs, taxes, and capital expenditures related to 
depreciation, new standards, and maintenance. Inputs to the GRIM include 
manufacturing costs, shipments forecasts, and price forecasts developed in other 
analyses. Another input, financial information, will be developed based on publicly 
available data and confidentially submitted manufacturer information. DOE compares the 
results of the GRIM against baseline projections where no standards are in place. The
financial impact of amended energy conservation standards is the difference between the 
two sets of discounted annual cash flows. 
12.2.2.2 Interview Guide 
DOE will conduct interviews with manufacturers to gather information on the 
effects of standards on revenues and finances, direct employment, capital assets, and 
industry competitiveness. Before the interviews, DOE will distribute an interview guide 
that will provide a starting point to identify relevant issues and help identify the impacts 
of standards on individual manufacturers or sub-groups of manufacturers. DOE 
anticipates that the interview guide will cover current organizational characteristics, 
industry infrastructure, manufacturer cash-flow analysis, a competitive impacts 
12-2

assessment, an employment impacts assessment, and a manufacturing capacity impacts 
assessment. 
12.2.3 Phase 3: Sub-Group Analysis 
Phase 3 activities will take place after the publication of the NOPR documents 
and will include manufacturer interviews, revision of the industry cash-flow analysis, 
manufacturer sub-group cash-flow analysis, competitive impact assessment, 
manufacturing capacity impact, employment impact, and cumulative regulatory burden.  
12.2.3.1 Manufacturer Interviews
The information gathered in Phase 1 and the cash-flow analysis performed in 
Phase 2 will be supplemented with information gathered during interviews with 
manufacturers during Phase 3. The interview process has a key role in the manufacturer 
impact analyses, since it provides an opportunity for interested parties to express their 
views privately on important issues, allowing confidential or sensitive information to be 
considered in the rulemaking decision. 
DOE will conduct detailed interviews with as many manufacturers as necessary to 
gain insight into the range of potential impacts of standards. During the interviews, DOE 
will solicit information on the possible impacts of standards on sales, direct employment, 
capital assets, and industry competitiveness. Both qualitative and quantitative information 
are valuable. Interviews will be scheduled well in advance in order to provide every 
opportunity for key individuals to be available for comment. Although a written response 
to the questionnaire will be acceptable, DOE prefers an interactive interview process 
because it helps clarify responses and provides the opportunity to identify additional 
issues. 
All information transmitted will be considered, as appropriate, in DOE’s decision-
making process. Interview participants will be asked to identify all confidential 
information provided in writing or orally; no confidential information will be made 
available in the public record. Participants will also be asked to identify all information 
they wish included in the public record but do not want to have associated with their 
interview. This information will be incorporated into the public record but reported 
without attribution.
12.2.3.2 Revised Industry Cash-Flow Analysis 
In Phase 2 of the MIA, DOE will provide manufacturers with a preliminary 
GRIM for review and evaluation. During the interviews, DOE will seek comment and 
suggestions regarding the values selected for the parameters. Upon completion of the 
interviews, DOE will revise its industry cash-flow model based on manufacturer 
feedback. 
12-3

12.2.3.3 Manufacturer Sub-Group Analysis 
Using average cost assumptions to develop an industry cash-flow estimate is not 
adequate for assessing differential impacts among sub-groups of manufacturers. Smaller 
manufacturers, niche players, or manufacturers exhibiting a cost structure that differs 
largely from the industry average could be more negatively affected. Ideally, DOE would 
consider the impact on every firm individually; however, it typically uses the results of
the industry characterization to group manufacturers exhibiting similar characteristics. 
During the interview process, DOE will discuss the potential sub-groups and sub-group 
members that have been identified for the analysis. DOE will look to the manufacturers 
and other stakeholders to suggest what sub-groups or characteristics are most appropriate 
for the analysis.
12.2.3.4 Competitive Impact Assessment 
Section 342 (6)(B)(i)(V) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPCA) directs DOE 
to consider any lessening of competition likely to result from imposition of standards. It
further directs the U.S. Attorney General to determine the impacts, if any, of any decrease 
in competition. DOE will make a determined effort to gather and report firm-specific 
financial information and impacts. The competitive analysis will focus on assessing the 
impacts on smaller, yet significant, manufacturers. The assessment will be based on 
manufacturing cost data and information collected from interviews with manufacturers. 
The manufacturer interviews will focus on gathering information that would help in 
assessing asymmetrical cost increases to some manufacturers, the potential increase in 
business risks from an increased proportion of fixed costs, and potential barriers to 
market entry (e.g., proprietary technologies).
12.2.3.5 Manufacturing Capacity Impact 
One of the significant outcomes of standards could be the obsolescence of 
existing manufacturing assets, including tooling and investment. The manufacturer 
interview guide will have a series of questions to help identify impacts on manufacturing 
capacity, specifically capacity utilization and plant location decisions in North America 
with and without a standard; the ability of manufacturers to upgrade or remodel existing 
facilities to accommodate the new requirements; the nature and value of stranded assets, 
if any; and estimates for any one-time restructuring and other charges, where applicable.
12.2.3.6 Employment Impact 
The impact of amended energy conservation standards on employment is an 
important consideration in the rulemaking process. To assess how domestic employment 
patterns might be affected, the interview will explore current employment trends in the 
refrigeration products industry. The interview will also solicit manufacturer views on 
changes in employment patterns that may result from increased standard levels. The 
employment impacts section of the interview guide will focus on current employment 
levels associated with manufacturers at each of their production facilities, expected future 
12-4  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
employment levels with and without a standard, and differences in workforce skills and 
issues related to the retraining of employees.
12.2.3.7 Cumulative Regulatory Burden 
DOE recognizes and seeks to mitigate the overlapping effects on manufacturers of 
amended energy conservation standards and other regulatory actions affecting the same
products. DOE will analyze and consider the impact on manufacturers of multiple, 
product-specific regulatory actions. Based on its own research and discussions with 
manufacturers, DOE identified several regulations and proposed regulations relevant to 
refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer manufacturers, including existing or new 
standards, potential limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including 
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants and foam-blowing agents, standards for other 
products made by refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer manufacturers, State 
energy conservation standards, and International energy conservation standards.  DOE 
will study the potential impacts of these cumulative burdens in greater detail during the 
MIA conducted during the NOPR phase.
12.3 PRELIMINARY MANUFACTURER IMPACT ANALYSIS  
During the preliminary rulemaking phase, DOE conducted a preliminary 
evaluation of the impact of potential amended energy conservation standards on 
manufacturer financial performance, manufacturing capacity and employment levels, and 
product utility and innovation. A primary focus was to identify the cumulative burden 
that industries face from the overlapping effect of new or recent DOE energy 
conservation standards and/or other regulatory action affecting the same products or 
industries. 
The primary sources of information for this analysis were on-site or telephone 
interviews with manufacturers of residential refrigeration products conducted during the 
fall and winter of 2008. To maintain confidentiality, DOE did not identify the individual 
manufacturers that disclosed information. The evaluation only reports aggregated 
information and does not disclose sensitive or company-specific information. 
For the preliminary MIA, DOE conducted interviews with manufacturers
primarily to identify key issues and gain insights into the qualitative impacts of amended 
energy conservation standards. For each product, DOE used an interview guide to gather 
responses from multiple manufacturers on many issues. All of the interview guides 
covered the same general topic areas, but each interview guide was adapted to the needs 
of each product category. Appendix 12-A contains a copy of the interview guides for 
residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. 
12.3.1 General Interview Structure 
The manufacturer interviews included questions relating to the following topics. 
DOE received responses to most, if not all, of these topics from various manufacturers. 
12-5  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
12.3.1.1 Key Issues 
Perhaps the most important aspect of the preliminary MIA is the opportunity to 
identify key manufacturer issues early in the development of amended energy 
conservation standards. During the interviews, DOE engages manufacturers in a 
discussion about what they perceive to be the key issues in the rulemaking. Key issues, 
once identified, are added to the list of topics explored during the interviews. For 
example, key issues in previous rulemakings have included concerns over patent 
protections that might prevent some companies from implementing higher efficiency 
designs. 
12.3.1.2 Shipment Projections 
Shipment projections can be a significant factor in determining the impacts of
amended energy conservation standards. The interviews provide an opportunity for 
manufacturers to share information that can help DOE quantify the magnitude of any 
changes in shipments resulting from amended energy conservation standards. DOE is 
interested in information relating to the current number of product shipments, broken 
down by product class, capacity rating, and efficiency level. DOE also seeks input on the 
forecast of future shipments absent amended energy conservation standards. 
Manufacturers are asked how they would expect shipments to change for the industry as a 
whole as a function of standard levels and why they expect these changes might occur. 
More specific questions aim to derive a price elasticity estimate for use in the national 
impact analysis (NIA) spreadsheet. 
Another aspect of the shipments discussion is to understand the impacts of a 
reduction in shipments on individual refrigeration products companies.  
12.3.1.3 Profitability
DOE requests manufacturers’ views on what they perceive to be the possible 
impact of potential amended energy conservation standards on their future profitability.
Amended energy conservation standards could affect financial performance in several 
different ways. Several of these impacts are captured in previous sections. For instance, 
the capital and product conversion outlays needed to upgrade or redesign products and 
product platforms before they have reached the end of their useful life can engender 
significant conversion costs that otherwise would not be expended, resulting in reduced 
cash flow and stranded investments. Higher energy efficiency standards also can result in 
higher per-unit costs that may deter some consumers from purchasing the products, or 
cause some consumers to choose less efficient products, thereby reducing shipments.  
12.3.1.4 Product Mix 
DOE is interested in understanding if amended energy conservation standards 
might change a manufacturer’s product mix and if this change affects profits. For 
example, higher energy efficiency standards might limit a manufacturer’s ability to 
differentiate products and market premium products that command higher profit margins.  
12-6  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The interview guide also investigates how amended energy conservation 
standards might affect a manufacturer’s consumer mix and its distribution channels, and 
how in turn this might change profitability. 
12.3.1.5  Conversion Costs, Manufacturing Capacity, and Employment 
Levels 
During the interviews, DOE asks manufacturers to quantify and explain both the 
capital and product conversion costs necessary to raise the energy efficiency of their 
product lines to the proposed standard levels. In some instances, manufacturers may be 
able to meet proposed standard levels by modifying existing products. In other cases, the 
necessary changes may entail a complete product-line redesign. In these situations, an 
increase in efficiency standards will cause manufacturers to incur one-time conversion 
capital expenditures and product-conversion expenses. Conversion capital expenditures 
are one-time investments in property, plant, and equipment. Product-conversion expenses 
include one-time investments in research, product development, testing, and marketing. 
One of the significant outcomes of amended energy conservation standards could 
be the obsolescence of existing manufacturing assets, including tooling and other capital 
investment. The interview guide includes questions to identify impacts on manufacturing 
capacity. DOE developed these questions to understand the impact of potential amended 
standards on: 
x  North American manufacturing capacity; 
x  capacity utilization and plant location decisions in North America both with and 
without standards; 
x  the ability of manufacturers to upgrade or remodel existing facilities to  
accommodate a new product mix; and  
x  the nature and value of stranded assets, if any. 
The impact of amended energy conservation standards on employment is an 
important consideration in the rulemaking process. DOE uses the interviews to explore 
current trends in production employment and solicit manufacturer views on changes in 
employment patterns resulting from amended energy conservation standards. Questions 
regarding employment impacts help to understand 
x  current employment levels associated with manufacturing the subject products at 
each production facility; 
x  expected future employment levels both with and without amended standards; and 
x  differences in workforce skills and issues related to retraining employees.

12.3.1.6 Market Shares and Industry Consolidation 
Amended energy conservation standards can alter the competitive dynamics of the 
marketplace. This can include prompting companies to enter the market, exit the market, 
or merge with other companies. The preliminary MIA interview questions ask 
manufacturers to share their perspectives on industry consolidation both in the absence of 
amended standards and assuming amended standards at various efficiency levels. The 
interview questions focus on gathering information that helps in assessing
x disproportionate cost increases to some manufacturers; 
x increased proportion of fixed costs potentially increasing business risks; and 
x potential barriers to market entry (e.g., proprietary technologies). 
DOE conducts an assessment of anti-competitive effects of proposed standards in 
order to protect the interests of the consumer. During the interviews, DOE solicits 
information to understand if amended standards could result in disproportionate 
economic or performance penalties for particular consumer/user sub-groups. 
DOE also asks manufacturers if amended energy conservation standards could 
result in products that will be more or less desirable to consumers due to changes in 
product functionality, utility, or other features. 
12.3.1.7 Product Utility and Innovation 
Amended energy conservation standards can force manufacturers to compromise 
product utility to consumers by eliminating energy-consuming features. During the 
interviews, DOE requests information on the effects of proposed standards on product 
utility. 
Amended energy conservation standards may require investment in conversion 
costs, including research and development (R&D). This required spending may force a 
manufacturer to reduce funding usually allocated to product innovation. Amended energy 
conservation standards may also force manufacturers to eliminate innovative energy-
consuming features from their products. During the interviews, DOE requests 
information on the effect of proposed standards on innovation. 
12.3.1.8 Impact on Small Manufacturers 
DOE will consider the possibility of small businesses being affected by the 
promulgation of amended energy conservation standards for residential refrigerators, 
refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. Should any small business manufacturers be identified, 
DOE will study the potential impacts on these small businesses in greater detail during 
the MIA.

EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.3.1.9 Cumulative Burden 
While any one regulation may not impose a significant burden on manufacturers, 
the combined effects of several impending regulations may have serious consequences 
for some manufacturers, groups of manufacturers, or entire industries. Assessing the 
impact of a single regulation may overlook this cumulative regulatory burden. 
Expenditures associated with meeting other regulations are an important aspect of 
DOE’s consideration of the “cumulative regulatory burden” the industry faces. The 
interviews help DOE identify the level and timing of investments manufacturers are 
expecting to incur as a result of these regulations. Manufacturers are also asked under 
what circumstances they might be able to coordinate any expenditures related to these 
regulations and efficiency standards. 
In addition to the amended energy conservation for residential refrigeration 
products, several other Federal regulations and pending regulations apply to other 
products these manufacturers make. DOE will investigate these cumulative regulatory 
burdens in greater detail during the NOPR phase of the rulemaking. 
12.3.1.10 State Energy Conservation Standards 
DOE identified and described regulatory programs at the state level in the market 
and technology assessment (chapter 3 of the preliminary TSD) for the products covered 
in this rulemaking. Multiple States have requirements for products covered under this 
rulemaking. Accommodating multiple State standards in addition to National standards 
raises costs for manufacturers. 
12.3.1.11 International Energy Conservation Standards 
DOE discussed regulatory programs from certain other countries, such as Canada 
and Mexico, in the market and technology assessment, (chapter 3 of the preliminary 
TSD). A few manufacturers sell a small portion of their total production to countries 
outside the United States. In these cases, the products must meet the standards for each 
country. Companies may design some units to meet more stringent standards than those 
imposed by the United States in order to minimize the number of product variations. 
12.4  RESIDENTIAL REFRIGERATION PRODUCT PRELIMINARY MIA 
RESULTS 
During the preliminary MIA interview, manufacturers identified key issues 
surrounding DOE’s rulemaking for refrigeration products and provided feedback 
regarding the potential impact of amended energy conservation standards. DOE 
summarized the feedback below.

12.4.1 Key Issues 
One of the main questions in each of the preliminary interview guide asks: “What 
are the key issues for your company regarding the refrigeration products energy 
conservation standard rulemaking?” This open question initiated dialogue with the 
manufacturers, enabling them to identify key points that DOE would explore and discuss 
during the interview. This section describes the key issues manufacturers felt were of the 
highest importance in relation to the residential refrigeration products energy 
conservation standards rulemaking and that would have the most significant impact on 
the industry. Manufacturers indicated that, for the most part, the risks associated with 
these issues increase with more stringent energy conservation standards. The issues are 
overall concerns that many manufacturers expressed and in some cases, are dependent 
upon the product class. 
Refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer manufacturers cited concerns
regarding a number of issues that are covered in greater detail elsewhere in this chapter. 
These issues were conversion costs, the impact to U.S. production and jobs, cumulative 
regulatory burden, and the impact on product utility. Detailed descriptions of these 
manufacturer concerns are provided in the appropriate sections that follow; only brief 
descriptions are provided here. 
x  Increased Conversion Costs – A number of manufacturers indicated that 
conversion costs will be much greater if the adopted standards require significant 
changes to efficiency rather than moderate changes to efficiency. This is due to 
the need for wall thickness increases rather than just component swaps in the case 
of significantly more stringent energy standards.   
x  Impact to U.S. Production and Jobs – Manufacturers generally agreed that 
increased standards requiring investment in new plants would most likely have 
the effect of lowering U.S. production and jobs because plants would be built 
overseas for the benefit of lower labor costs. 
x  Cumulative Regulatory Burden – Many manufacturers indicated that refrigeration 
products face a number of pieces of new legislation that would exacerbate the 
burden created from more stringent energy standards. These include a potential 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) bill in the U.S. and changing energy standards in Canada 
and abroad.
x  Impact to Product Utility – Several manufacturers expressed concern about the 
possibility of lower product utility resulting from stricter energy standards. If 
thicker walls are required to meet new standards, internal volumes would be 
reduced while still using the same amount of floor space. Other features that can 
increase energy usage, such as glass doors and multiple temperature zones in 
drawer compartments, may have to be removed if standards are significantly 
stricter. 
12-10  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
The other issues of key importance to manufacturers are the current poor economic 
conditions, the circumvention of new standards and need for enforcement, and the timing 
and technical difficulty of achieving new standards. 
x  Current Economic Conditions – A number of manufacturers indicated that the 
current status of the U.S. economy has put strains on the financial conditions of 
their companies. This strain diminishes their ability to support the investments 
required to meet new energy standards and causes a competition for capital 
between these required investments and other opportunities such as research and 
new product development. Any impact from new standards on conversion costs, 
U.S. production, and jobs would be greater because of the difficult economic 
environment. 
x  Circumvention and Enforcement – Several manufacturers expressed concern that 
some manufacturers have not followed the intent of the current test procedure or 
have actively circumvented the test procedure via sensors that detect test 
conditions. These sensors direct a controller to disable certain energy-using 
functions during the test in order to achieve lower energy consumption for the 
Energy Guide labeling. These actions have hurt domestic manufacturers 
competitively. Other companies expressed concern that there is not enough 
enforcement of energy standards to ensure that products meet the ratings on their 
labels. Some import brands have submitted incorrect or incomplete data to DOE 
for labeling, particularly for compact product classes. Since some importers 
source from multiple manufacturers, and label submissions are associated with the 
import brand rather than the manufacturing company, it is difficult to track 
labeling issues to the original manufacturer. 
x  Technical Difficulty to Achieve New Standards – Many manufacturers expressed 
concerns about the technical difficulty in achieving new standards that are 
significantly more stringent than current levels. They pointed out that there are 
fewer additional low-cost technology improvements available now than there 
were during past rulemakings. Specifically, compact freezers  were cited as a 
product class in which it will be especially difficult to make significant 
improvements. The standards for compact freezers are already more stringent 
relative to capacity than are standards for compact refrigerators. Compact units, in 
general, pose a challenge because there are very few low-capacity compressors 
with sufficiently high efficiencies. Several manufacturers indicated that 
improvements could be made, but highlighted the importance of staying informed 
by DOE of the proposed new standard levels throughout the rulemaking process. 
They also emphasized having adequate time between the final rule and the 
effective date of the new standards to ensure adequate time is available to 
redesign products and to make the appropriate investments in manufacturing 
lines.

12.4.2 Profitability, Product Mix, and Shipments 
DOE asked manufacturers during the preliminary manufacturer interviews how 
amended energy conservation standards would affect their profitability, product mix, and 
overall shipments. Nearly all manufacturers stated that amended energy conservation 
standards could lower profits depending upon the efficiency level under consideration by 
DOE. In particular, manufacturers indicate that new standards requiring cost increases of 
15-20 percent or more would have significant impacts through lowered industry 
shipments and a shift in product mix.  
Manufacturers of all types of refrigeration products state that cost increases at 
these levels would drive consumers toward lower-cost products. Nearly all manufacturers 
have certain product lines that would have difficulty meeting new standards that are 
significantly stricter. They say that they would most likely drop some of these products 
because of technical difficulties in achieving new standards.  
Several manufacturers of refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers stated that they 
would shift their product mix to compete in lower cost products or would no longer be 
able to compete as heavily in ENERGY STAR products. This would lower profitability 
because lower cost and baseline products typically cannot command as much of a margin 
as do premium and Energy Star products. Contrarily, some manufacturers expect to move 
more strongly towards higher-end products because of the higher profit margins 
available. They contend that the cost-competitive nature of low-end refrigeration 
products makes it very difficult to pass on increased costs to the consumer. For this 
reason, they indicate that they would modify their product mix to be weighted more 
heavily toward higher-margin products. One manufacturer even noted that it would exit 
certain low-margin product classes completely if the investment costs required to meet 
the amended energy standards were too high. Still, other manufacturers did not expect to 
change their product mix much at all, either because their product platforms are far from
the end of their efficiency capability or because their market strategy calls for 
maintaining a fixed portion of ENERGY STAR products. 
All manufacturers agree that amended energy standards would decrease profit 
margins for refrigeration products in general. Manufacturers stated that the extent to 
which margins diminish will depend on how much cost their competitors are able to pass 
through to the customer. Manufacturers of higher-end products have higher margins, and 
thus greater capacity to absorb cost increases, whereas entry level products have very thin 
margins and minimal capacity to absorb cost increases. Manufacturers stated that 
customers of lower-end products are very price-sensitive and the ability of a 
manufacturer to pass cost increases through without affecting demand for low-end 
products is extremely limited. In general, most manufacturers agree that significantly 
stricter amended energy standards would increase retail prices and lower demand for 
refrigeration products across the board. Specifically, many indicated that increased costs 
will price some consumers out of the market completely and bring would-be purchasers 
of higher-end units down to entry-level products, thereby reducing both overall demand 
and demand for higher-margin refrigeration products.

12.4.3 Conversion Costs, Manufacturing Capacity, and Employment Levels 
DOE estimated that a typical high-volume domestic refrigerator, refrigerator-
freezer, or freezer production line would have a life cycle of approximately ten years in 
the absence of amended energy conservation standards. During that period, 
manufacturers would not make major equipment changes that alter the underlying 
platforms. Thus, an amended energy conservation standard that took effect and resulted 
in a major platform redesign before the end of the platform’s life would strand a portion 
of the earlier capital investments. 
DOE asked manufacturers what level of conversion costs they anticipate if 
amended energy conservation standards were to take effect. Manufacturers said that 
conversion costs would be significant if amended standards require new product 
platforms, as opposed to component swaps only. The primary changes that would dictate 
new product platforms are significant alterations to wall thicknesses or the use of vacuum
insulated panels (VIP). The cost of such changes varies by manufacturer, depending on 
the volume of production and whether capital, tooling, and engineering investments are 
required. Lower-volume manufacturers have indicated that conversion costs in this 
scenario could range from a few million dollars to tens of millions. Higher volume 
manufacturers have indicated potential costs in the range of hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
Additionally, manufacturers have identified the cost of plant closings as an 
important component of conversion costs. Several manufacturers indicated that 
significant energy efficiency increases would drive them to construct new plants in 
lower-cost labor markets. Mexico, specifically, was offered as a potential location. Some
existing U.S. plants would either be closed or downsized, reducing domestic employment 
levels and leaving some stranded assets. Contrarily, a few domestic manufacturers 
indicated that they would have few stranded assets or that they would not move 
production outside the U.S. 
12.4.3.1 Impact on U.S. Production and Jobs 
The impact of amended energy conservation standards on employment is an 
important consideration in the rulemaking process. As indicated in section 12.3.2.3 
above, significant increases to the energy efficiency standards for refrigeration products 
would cause some manufacturers to close domestic production facilities and to construct 
new plants outside of the U.S. Manufacturers with existing facilities abroad indicated that 
they may expand or modify those facilities rather than build entirely new plants.  
12.4.3.2 Foreign Labor 
Manufacturers indicated that there has been a shift in production out of the United 
States, in particular to Mexico. For compact products, the trend has been towards 
production even further from the U.S., particularly China. Manufacturers said that 
amended energy conservation standards could exacerbate these trends. Some
manufacturers are very committed to keeping production in the U.S., but in general these 
12-13  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
do not include the highest-volume manufacturers. Consideration of production outside 
the U.S. is primarily driven by concerns about profitability and the opportunity for lower 
labor costs. 
12.4.4 Industry Consolidation 
Three companies now account for the majority of U.S. sales of residential 
refrigeration products. The relative market share among these companies and between 
these companies and other manufacturers varies depending on product class. In certain 
product classes, other manufacturers dominate the market. A trend of consolidation has 
occurred within the industry in recent years. Most manufacturers anticipate further 
consolidation in the future, even in the absence of amended energy conservation 
standards. Manufacturers also indicated that new standards could impact future 
consolidation by making certain manufacturers less competitive.   
12.4.5 Impact on Product Utility and Innovation 
Amended energy conservation standards can affect purchasers of residential 
refrigeration products by increasing or decreasing the utility of such products. 
Manufacturers generally agree that stringent energy efficiency standards would decrease 
innovations and reduce product utility. They believe that product utility would be 
impacted in several ways. First, significantly stricter standards would increase the costs 
of refrigeration products across the board. Most manufacturers believe that the price 
increases would force lower income customers out of the market for refrigeration 
products altogether. Second, meeting new standards will likely require manufacturers to 
increase product wall thicknesses. Most residential kitchens have limited refrigerator 
space, so the wall thicknesses of refrigeration products would be forced to grow inward. 
This leaves less internal volume available for use by the customer. This is an issue of 
great concern for virtually all manufacturers. Finally, several manufacturers indicated that 
other product features currently available today may have to be removed in order to meet 
new standard levels and maintain acceptable product costs. Examples of these features 
include ice and water dispensers, glass doors, soda can dispensers, crisper compartments, 
antisweat features, and food preservation capabilities.  
Manufacturers also believe that product innovation would be affected by amended 
energy conservation standards. Specifically, they say that innovation will increase in the 
area of energy efficiency, but it will decrease or disappear in the development of other 
features. New efficiency standards would cause manufacturers to divert money from the 
development of new, brand-differentiating features to the development of features that 
decrease energy usage. 
12.4.6 Cumulative Burdens 
Based on its own research and discussions with manufacturers, DOE identified 
several regulations relevant to residential refrigeration products, including:  
x regulations from the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC); 
12-14  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
x potential climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation; 
x new DOE test procedures for residential refrigeration products; 
x standards for other products made by residential refrigeration product 
manufacturers;  
x other State energy conservation standards; and  
x international energy conservation standards. 
Complying with such regulations requires corporations to invest both human and 
capital resources. The following subsections discuss in greater detail regulations affecting 
the residential refrigeration products industry. 
12.4.6.1  Pending Regulations from the CPSC 
Several manufacturers stated that the CPSC was considering regulations regarding 
the labeling and materials identification for residential refrigeration products. They 
indicated that the regulations would essentially duplicate existing Underwriters 
Laboratories (UL) certification requirements for safety. At the time that the manufacturer 
impact analysis interviews were conducted, the new CPSC regulations were still pending. 
The rulemaking was passed in December 2008, however, and is published in 16 CFR 
1101. 
12.4.6.2  Potential Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Legislation 
Many manufacturers expressed concern about potential climate change
legislation. This is an area of great importance within the industry. Manufacturers expect 
a climate change bill that regulates the use and emissions of GHG’s to be passed by 
Congress in the near future. As a result, use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC’s), the most 
commonly used refrigerants and foam-blowing agents, would become restricted. These 
substances would eventually be phased out, or their use capped at a restricted level. This 
presents a problem for manufacturers because the key alternative insulation foam
blowing agent is cyclopentane. Insulation made with this blowing agent has higher 
conductivity than current state-of-the art foam insulation, and conversion to cyclopentane 
presents factory issues due to its flammability..Conversion of the currently-used 
refrigerant, HFC-134a, to the most likely alternative, R-600a or isobutane, would require 
product redesign, and causes issues associated with safety certification compliance under 
UL regulations. Proposed legislation presents uncertainty for manufacturers as to how 
hydrocarbon refrigerants and foam-blowing agents would be regulated for safety within 
the U.S. Manufacturers indicate that the costs of making changes associated with 
conversion to new refrigerants and blowing agents would be in the millions of dollars.  
12.4.6.3  Standards for Other Products Made by Residential Refrigeration 
Products Manufacturers 
In addition to the efficiency regulations for residential refrigeration products, 
several other Federal regulations and pending regulations apply to other products 
manufactured by the companies that manufacture refrigeration products. Many of these 
companies manufacture multiple lines of residential appliances, including clothes 
12-15  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
 
 
washers, clothes dryers, dishwashers, and cooking products, all of which are also subject 
to Federal efficiency regulations. Some of these products are currently undergoing 
rulemakings amending the test procedures to incorporate standby and off mode energy 
consumption as well. Additionally, manufacturers pointed out that changes are being 
made to the refrigeration products test procedures concurrent with the refrigeration 
products energy conservation standard rulemaking.  
12.4.6.4 State and International Standards 
Manufacturers stated that there are a number of state and international standards 
that they must adhere to in addition to those currently under consideration in this 
rulemaking. European standards such as the Restriction on the use of Hazardous 
Substances (RoHS), Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and the 
Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) create 
additional compliance costs for manufacturers that compete in Europe. Manufacturers 
indicated that California has programs similar to these that are either already in place or 
are currently in development. Additionally, different efficiency standards in foreign 
countries add to the range of regulations that manufacturers must meet. DOE will 
investigate these cumulative regulatory burdens in greater detail during the MIA analysis. 
12.4.7 Impact on Small Manufacturers 
The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines small business manufacturing 
enterprises for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 335222, 
Household Refrigerator and Home Freezer Manufacturing, as companies with 1000 or 
less employees. SBA lists small business size standards that are matched to industries as 
they are described in the NAICS. The size standard defines the maximum allowable size 
of a for-profit small business for Federal Government programs. Size standards are 
generally based on the average annual receipts or the average number of employees at a 
firm.  
The manufacturer interviews indicated that smaller refrigeration product 
manufacturers typically have smaller corporate research and development and 
engineering staff than larger manufacturers. Smaller manufacturers often produce niche 
or specialty products and focus on providing products that other larger manufacturers do 
not produce. Although small manufacturers often have a more limited product range than 
larger manufacturers, the effort to address some aspects of regulations are relatively fixed 
and do not scale directly with the number of products or product platforms produced. 
Consequently, the cumulative burden of regulations will tend to place more of a burden 
on smaller manufacturers because of their more limited resources. 
DOE will study the potential impacts to these small businesses in greater detail 
during the MIA.

CHAPTER 13. UTILITY IMPACT ANALYSIS  
13.1 INTRODUCTION  
The Department of Energy (DOE) will analyze specific effects of its proposed standard 
levels on the electric utility industry as part of the notice of proposed rulemaking analyses, using 
a variant of the U.S. DOE/Energy Information Administration (EIA)’s National Energy 
Modeling System (NEMS).  The NEMS is a large, multi-sectoral, partial equilibrium model of
the U.S. energy sector.  EIA uses NEMS to produce the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).1  NEMS
produces a widely recognized baseline energy forecast for the United States, and this energy 
forecast is available in the public domain.  DOE will use a variant known as NEMS-BT to 
provide key inputs to the analysis. 
The utility impact analysis will consist of a comparison between model results for the 
base case and for policy cases in which proposed standards are in place.  The use of NEMS-BT 
for the utility analysis offers several advantages.  As the official DOE energy forecasting model, 
NEMS relies on a set of assumptions that are transparent and have received wide exposure and 
commentary. NEMS-BT allows an estimate of the interactions between the various energy 
supply and demand sectors and the economy as a whole.  The utility impact analysis will report 
the changes in installed capacity and generation, by fuel type, that result for each trial standard 
level, as well as changes in electricity and natural gas sales to the residential and commercial 
sectors. 
DOE plans to conduct the utility impact analysis as a policy deviation from the 2009 
version of the AEO that reflect provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
(ARRA) and recent changes in the economic outlook (AEO2009),1 applying the same basic set of 
assumptions.  For example, the operating characteristics (e.g., energy conversion efficiency, 
emissions rates) of future electricity generating plants are as specified in the AEO2009 reference 
case. DOE also will explore deviations from some of the reference case assumptions, to represent 
alternative futures. Two alternative scenarios use the high and low economic growth cases.  
(The reference case corresponds to medium growth.)  The high economic growth case assumes 
higher projected growth rates for population, labor force, and labor productivity, resulting in 
lower predicted inflation and interest rates relative to the reference case and higher overall 
aggregate economic growth.  The opposite is true for the low growth case.  Because EIA does 
not plan to produce high and low economic growth cases corresponding to the AEO2009 that

includes the ARRA, DOE plans to estimate these cases based on the March 2009 release of the 
AEO2009 that excludes the ARRA.2 
13.2 METHODOLOGY 
The electric utility impact analysis will consist of NEMS-BT forecasts for generation, 
installed capacity, sales, and prices.  NEMS provides reference case load shapes for several end 
uses. The model uses predicted growth in demand for each end use to build up a projection of 
the total electric system load growth for each region, which it uses in turn to predict the 
necessary additions to capacity. NEMS-BT accounts for the implementation of efficiency 
standards by decrementing the appropriate reference case load shape.  DOE will determine the 
size of the decrement using data for the per-unit energy savings developed in the life-cycle cost 
and payback period analysis (Chapter 8) and the forecast of shipments developed for the national 
impact analysis (Chapter 9). 
The predicted reduction in capacity additions is sensitive to the peak load impacts of the 
standard. DOE will investigate the need to adjust the hourly load profiles that include this end 
use in NEMS-BT. 
 Since the AEO2009 version of NEMS forecasts only to the year 2030, DOE must 
extrapolate results to 2044. DOE conducts an extrapolation to 2044 to be consistent with the 
analysis period being used by DOE in the national impact analysis (NIA).  It will not be feasible 
to extend the forecast period of NEMS-BT for the purposes of this analysis, nor does EIA have 
an approved method for extrapolation of many outputs beyond 2030.  While it might seem
reasonable in general to make simple linear extrapolations of results, in practice this is not 
advisable because outputs could be contradictory.  For example, changes in the fuel mix implied 
by extrapolations of those outputs could be inconsistent with the extrapolation of marginal 
emissions factors.  An analysis of various trends sufficiently detailed to guarantee consistency is 
beyond the scope of this work and, in any case, would involve a great deal of uncertainty.  
Therefore, for all extrapolations beyond 2030, DOE intends to use simple replications of year 
2030 results; in this way results are guaranteed to be consistent.  As with the AEO reference case 
in general, the implicit assumption is that the regulatory environment does not deviate from the 
current known situation during the extrapolation period.  Only changes that have been announced 
with date-certain introduction are included in NEMS-BT.  
For petroleum products, EIA uses the average growth rate for the world oil price over the 
years 2010 to 2025, in combination with the refinery and distribution markups from the year 
2025, to determine the regional price forecasts.  Similarly, EIA derives natural gas prices from an 
average growth rate figure in combination with regional price margins from the year 2025.

CHAPTER 14. EMPLOYMENT IMPACT ANALYSIS  
14.1 INTRODUCTION  
The Department of Energy (DOE) intends the employment impact analysis to estimate 
national job creation or job elimination resulting from possible new standards, due to reallocation 
of the associated expenditures for purchasing and operating equipment. DOE will conduct this 
analysis as one of the analyses for the notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR).  DOE will 
estimate national impacts on major sectors of the U.S. economy, using publicly available data 
and incorporating different energy price scenarios that it will carry out as part of the analysis for 
the NOPR. DOE will make all methods and documentation available for review. 
The imposition of standards can impact employment both directly and indirectly.  Direct 
employment impacts are changes in the number of employees at the plants that produce the 
covered equipment, along with the affiliated distribution and service companies, resulting from
the imposition of standards.  DOE will evaluate direct employment impacts in its manufacturer 
impact analysis, as described in Chapter 12.  Indirect employment impacts may result from
expenditures shifting between goods (the substitution effect) and changes in income and overall 
expenditure levels (the income effect) that occur due to the imposition of standards.   
DOE expects new equipment standards to decrease energy consumption, and therefore to 
reduce expenditures for energy. The savings in energy expenditures may be spent on new 
investment and other items.  The standards may increase the purchase price of equipment, 
including the retail price plus sales tax, and increase installation costs. 
Using an input-output model of the U.S. economy, this analysis seeks to estimate the 
year-to-year effect of these expenditure impacts on net economic output and employment.  
A simple model might involve reduced expenditures for energy and reallocation of that money 
toward other sectors in the economy.  DOE intends the employment impact analysis to quantify 
the indirect employment impacts of these expenditure changes.  It will evaluate direct 
employment impacts in the manufacturer impact analysis step of the process. 
14.2 METHODOLOGY 
To investigate the combined direct and indirect employment impacts, DOE will use the 
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)’s ‘Impact of Sector Energy Technologies’ 
(ImSET) model.1  PNNL developed ImSET, a spreadsheet model of the U.S. economy that 
focuses on 188 sectors most relevant to industrial, commercial, and residential building energy 
use, for DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  ImSET is a special-purpose 
version of the U.S. Benchmark National Input-Output (I-O) model, which has been designed to 
estimate the national employment and income effects of energy saving technologies that are 
deployed by DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  In comparison with the 
14-1  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
  
 
   
 
previous versions of the model used in earlier rulemakings, this version allows for more
complete and automated analysis of the essential features of energy efficiency investments in 
buildings, industry, transportation, and the electric power sectors.   
The ImSET software includes a computer-based I-O model with structural coefficients to 
characterize economic flows among the 188 sectors.  ImSET’s national economic I-O structure is 
based on the 1997 Benchmark U.S. table, specially aggregated to 188 sectors.2 
DOE intends to use the ImSet model to estimate changes in employment, industry output, 
and wage income in the overall U.S. economy resulting from changes in expenditures in the 
various sectors of the economy.  For example, commercial clothes washer standards may reduce 
energy expenditures and increase equipment prices in the commercial sector.  These expenditure 
changes are likely to reduce commercial and energy sector employment.  At the same time, these 
equipment standards may increase commercial sector investment, and increase employment in 
other sectors of the economy.  DOE designed the employment impact analysis to estimate the 
year-to-year net national employment effect of these different expenditure flows.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR PROPOSED ENERGY CONSERVATION  
STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL REFRIGERATAORS, REFRIGERATOR-
FREEZERS, AND FREEZERS  
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The Department of Energy (DOE) will conduct an environmental assessment as part of 
the notice of proposed rulemaking.  DOE will assess the impacts of proposed energy 
conservation standards for residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers on certain 
environmental indicators using a variant of the U.S. DOE/Energy Information Administration 
(EIA)’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS).a  EIA uses NEMS to produce the Annual 
Energy Outlook (AEO).1  DOE will use a variant known as NEMS-BT to provide key inputs to 
the analysis, based on the 2009 version of the AEO (AEO2009). Results of the environmental 
assessment will be similar to those provided in AEO2009. 
DOE intends the environmental assessment to provide emissions results to policymakers 
and other stakeholders, and to fulfill requirements that the environmental effects of all new 
Federal rules be properly quantified and considered.  The environmental assessment considers 
three pollutants— sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury (Hg)—as well as 
carbon emissions.  The only form of carbon emissions tracked by NEMS-BT is carbon dioxide 
(CO2), so the carbon discussed in this report is only in the form of CO2. For each of the trial 
standard levels, DOE will calculate total emissions using NEMS-BT, using additional, external 
analysis as needed. 
Although DOE plans to consider only SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2 in its environmental 
assessment, there are other air pollutants which are of concern.  Specifically, the Clean Air Act 
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards for the following six common air pollutants, also know as “criteria pollutants”: (1) 
ozone, (2) particulate matter (PM), (3) carbon monoxide (CO), (4) nitrogen dioxide, (5) SO2, and 
(6) lead.2  EPA recently added to this list mercury.  But none of the “criteria pollutants” not 
already considered (i.e., ozone, PM, CO, and lead) are driven significantly by electric utility 
power plants. Therefore, DOE does not intend on addressing them in the environmental 
assessment.  In the case of ozone and particulate matter, other pollutants are precursors to their 
formation and atmospheric conditions are the driver behind their formation.  Also, SO2 and NOx 
are the primary precursors to ozone and PM, respectively, and will already be addressed by the 
environmental assessment.  In the case of CO, electric utilities are not significant sources.  For 
electric power plants, almost all carbon emissions come out in the form of CO2 as the 
combustion process is lean enough not to yield CO in significant amounts.  Finally, with regard 
to lead, the ban on the use of leaded gasoline has resulted in a dramatic decrease in lead 
emissions since the mid 1970s.  Now industrial processes (not electric utilities), particularly 
a For more information on NEMS, please refer to the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information 
Administration documentation.  A useful summary is National Energy Modeling System:  An Overview 2000, 
DOE/EIA-0581(2000), March 2000.  EIA approves use of the name NEMS to describe only an official version of
the model without any modification to code or data.  Because this analysis entails some minor code modifications
and the model is run under various policy scenarios that are variations on EIA assumptions, DOE refers to the model
as NEMS-BT (BT is DOE’s Building Technologies Program).  NEMS-BT was previously called NEMS-BRS.

primary and secondary lead smelters and battery manufacturers, are responsible for most of lead 
emissions and all violations of the lead air quality standards.  
2.0 METHODOLOGY
DOE plans to conduct the utility impact analysis as a policy deviation from the 2009 
version of the AEO that reflect provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
(ARRA) and recent changes in the economic outlook (AEO2009),1 applying the same basic set of 
assumptions.  For example, the emissions characteristics of an electricity generating plant will be 
exactly those used in AEO2009. The NEMS reference case and alternative growth scenarios are 
as described in the utility impact analysis (see Chapter 13 of the preliminary technical support 
document).  Below are descriptions of the air emissions that DOE will analyze in the 
environmental assessment. 
2.1 Air Emissions 
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is not a regulated or criteria pollutant, but it is of interest because 
of its classification as a greenhouse gas (GHG).  GHGs trap the sun’s radiation inside the Earth’s 
atmosphere and either occur naturally in the atmosphere or result from human activities.  
Naturally occurring GHGs include water vapor, CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and 
ozone (O3). Human activities, however, add to the levels of most of these naturally occurring 
gases. For example, CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere when solid waste, fossil fuels (oil, natural 
gas, and coal), wood, and wood products are burned.  During the past 20 years, about three-
quarters of anthropogenic (i.e., human-made) CO2 emissions resulted from burning fossil fuels.  
Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere are naturally regulated by numerous processes, 
collectively known as the “carbon cycle.”  The movement of carbon between the atmosphere and 
the land and oceans is dominated by natural processes, such as plant photosynthesis.  While these 
natural processes can absorb some of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions produced each year, 
billions of metric tons are added to the atmosphere annually.  In the U. S., CO2 emissions from
both energy generation and industrial processes account for 84.6 percent of total U.S. GHG 
emissions. 
NEMS-BT tracks carbon emissions using a detailed carbon module; this approach 
provides good results because of its broad coverage of all sectors and inclusion of interactive 
effects. Past experience with carbon results from NEMS suggests that the NEMS-generated 
emissions estimates are somewhat lower than estimates based on simple average factors.  One of 
the reasons for this divergence is that NEMS tends to predict that conservation displaces 
renewable generating capacity in the later years of its forecast.  On the whole, NEMS-BT 
provides carbon emissions results of reasonable accuracy, at a level consistent with other 
published Federal results.

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) 
The NEMS-BT model reports the two airborne pollutant emissions that DOE has reported 
in past analyses, SO2 and NOx. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 set an SO2 emissions 
cap on all power generation.3  The attainment of this target, however, is flexible among 
generators through the use of emissions allowances and tradable permits.  The NEMS-BT model 
includes a module for SO2 allowance trading and delivers a forecast of SO2 allowance prices. 
Accurate simulation of SO2 trading tends to imply that physical emissions effects will be zero, as 
long as emissions are at the ceiling.  But to the extent reduced power generation demand 
decreases the demand for and price of emissions allowance permits, there is an environmentally 
related economic benefit from the proposed energy conservation standards reducing SO2 
emissions allowance demand.  Furthermore, over time, if emissions decline, there is greater 
flexibility in reducing the ceiling amount.  However, since DOE does not anticipate a change in 
SO2 emissions, DOE does not plant to report SO2 emission impacts.  There is an SO2 benefit 
from conservation in the form of a lower allowance price but, since the impact of any one 
standard on the allowance price is likely small and highly uncertain, DOE does not plan to 
monetize the SO2 benefit. 
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
 Nitrogen oxides, or NOx, are the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of
which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts.  Many of the nitrogen oxides are 
colorless and odorless. However, one common pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), along with 
particles in the air can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas.  NO2 is the 
specific form of NOx reported in this document.  NOx is one of the main ingredients involved in 
the formation of ground-level ozone, which can trigger serious respiratory problems.  It can 
contribute to the formation of acid rain, and can impair visibility in areas such as national parks.  
NOx also contributes to the formation of fine particles that can impair human health. 
Nitrogen oxides form when fossil fuel is burned at high temperatures, as in a combustion 
process. The primary manmade sources of NOx are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and other 
industrial, commercial, and residential sources that burn fossil fuels.  NOx can also be formed 
naturally. Electric utilities account for about 22 percent of NOx emissions in the United States. 
NEMS-BT also has an algorithm for estimating NOx emissions from power generation.  
The impact of these emissions, however, will be affected by the Clean Air Interstate Rule 
(CAIR), which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued under sections 110 and 
111 of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR Parts 51, 96, and 97) on May 12, 2005.4  CAIR will 
permanently cap emissions of SO2 and NOx in eastern states of the United States. CAIR 
achieves large reductions of SO2 and/or NOx emissions across 28 eastern states and the District 
of Columbia (DC). States must achieve the required emission reductions using one of two 
compliance options: 1) meet an emission budget for each regulated state by requiring power 
plants to participate in an EPA-administered interstate cap-and-trade system that caps emissions 
in two stages, or 2) meet an individual state emissions budget through measures of the state’s 
choosing. Phase 1 caps for NOx are to be in place in 2009. Phase 1 caps for SO2 are to be in 
place in 2010.  The Phase 2 caps for both pollutants are due in 2015.

On July 11, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. 
Circuit) issued its decision in North Carolina v. Environmental Protection Agency, which 
vacated the CAIR issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on March 10, 2005.5 
But on December 23, 2008, the D.C. Circuit decided to allow CAIR to remain in effect until it is 
replaced by a rule consistent with the court’s earlier opinion. North Carolina v. Environmental 
Protection Agency, 550 F.3d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (remand of vacatur).  
The NEMS-BT version to be used by DOE to estimate NOx emission impacts includes 
the cap on NOx emissions as specified by CAIR.  As with SO2 emissions, a cap on NOx 
emissions means that equipment efficiency standards may have no physical effect on these 
emissions in the 28 eastern states and DC.  When NOx emissions are subject to emissions caps, 
DOE’s emissions reduction estimate corresponds to incremental changes in the prices of 
emissions allowances in cap-and-trade emissions markets rather than physical emissions 
reductions. Therefore, while the emissions cap may mean that physical emissions reductions 
will not result from standards in those states covered by CAIR, standards could produce an 
environmental-related economic benefit in the form of lower prices for emissions allowance 
credits. However, as with SO2 allowance prices, DOE does not plan to monetize this benefit 
because the impact on the NOx allowance price from any single energy conservation standard is 
likely small and highly uncertain.  For those states not covered by CAIR, DOE intends to 
estimate the impact on NOx emissions using NEMS-BT. 
Mercury (Hg)
Coal-fired power plants emit Hg found in coal during the burning process.  While coal-
fired power plants are the largest remaining source of human-generated Hg emissions in the 
United States, they contribute very little to the global Hg pool or to contamination of U.S. 
waters. U.S. coal-fired power plants emit Hg in three different forms: oxidized Hg (likely to 
deposit within the United States); elemental Hg, which can travel thousands of miles before 
depositing to land and water; and Hg that is in particulate form.  Atmospheric Hg is then 
deposited on land, lakes, rivers, and estuaries through rain, snow, and dry deposition.  Once 
there, it can transform into methylmercury and accumulate in fish tissue through 
bioaccumulation. 
Americans are exposed to methylmercury primarily by eating contaminated fish. Because 
the developing fetus is the most sensitive to the toxic effects of methylmercury, women of
childbearing age are regarded as the population of greatest concern.  Children exposed to 
methylmercury before birth may be at increased risk of poor performance on neurobehavioral 
tasks, such as those measuring attention, fine motor function, language skills, visual-spatial 
abilities, and verbal memory.  
NEMS-BT has an algorithm for estimating these emissions from power generation.  EPA 
issued on May 18, 2005 the final rule entitled “Standards of Performance for New and Existing 
Stationary Sources: Electric Steam Generating Units,” under sections 110 and 111 of the Clean 
Air Act (40 CFR Parts 60, 63, 72, and 75).6  This rule, also called the Clean Air Mercury Rule 
(CAMR), was closely related to the CAIR and established standards of performance for Hg 
EA-4  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
emissions from new and existing coal-fired electric utility steam generating units.  The CAMR 
regulated Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants.  But on February 8, 2008, the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued its decision in State of New 
Jersey, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency,7 in which the Court, among other actions, 
vacated the CAMR referenced above. EPA has recently decided to develop emissions standards 
for power plants under the Clean Air Act (Section 112), consistent with the D.C. Circuit’s 
opinion on the CAMR. Accordingly, on February 6, 2009, the Department of Justice, on behalf 
of EPA, asked the Supreme Court to dismiss EPA’s request (petition for certiorari) that the Court 
review the D.C. Circuit Court’s vacatur of the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR). On February 
23, 2009, the Court also denied the Utility Air Regulatory Group’s request to review the U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals decision. 
The NEMS-BT version to be used by DOE to estimate Hg emission impacts does not cap 
Hg emissions and will not do so until the EPA issues a rule regarding Hg that is consistent with 
the Court’s decision. 
2.2 Economic Value of Emission Reductions 
In examining the impact of potential standards, DOE plans to assess potential monetary 
benefits from reduced emissions of CO2, NOx, Hg, and SO2 associated with this rulemaking.  
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) 
DOE plans on relying on a set of values developed by an interagency process that 
conducted a thorough review of existing estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC). The SCC 
is intended to be a monetary measure of the incremental damage resulting from greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, including, but not limited to, net agricultural productivity loss, human health 
effects, property damages from sea level rise, and changes in ecosystem services. Any effort to 
quantify and to monetize the harms associated with climate change will raise serious questions of
science, economics, and ethics. But with full regard for the limits of both quantification and 
monetization, the SCC can be used to provide estimates of the social benefits of reductions in 
GHG emissions.  
For at least three reasons, any single estimate of the SCC will be contestable. First, 
scientific and economic knowledge about the impacts of climate change continues to grow. With 
new and better information about relevant questions, including the cost, burdens, and possibility 
of adaptation, current estimates will inevitably change over time. Second, some of the likely and 
potential damages from climate change—for example, the value society places on adverse 
impacts on endangered species—are not included in all of the existing economic analyses. These 
omissions may mean that the best current estimates are too low. Third, controversial ethical 
judgments, including those involving the treatment of future generations, play a role in 
judgments about the SCC (see in particular the discussion of the discount rate, below).  
To date, regulations have used a range of values for the SCC. For example, a regulation 
proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2008 assumed a value of $7 per 
ton CO2 (2006$) for 2011 emission reductions (with a range of $0–14 for sensitivity analysis). 
Regulation finalized by DOE used a range of $0–$20 (2007$). Both of these ranges were 
EA-5  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
designed to reflect the value of damages to the United States resulting from carbon emissions, or 
the “domestic” SCC. In the final Model Year 2011 Corporate Average Fuel Economy rule, DOT 
used both a domestic SCC value of $2/t CO2 and a global SCC value of $33/t CO2 (with 
sensitivity analysis at $80/tCO2), increasing at 2.4 percent per year thereafter.  
In recent months, a variety of agencies have worked to develop an objective methodology 
for selecting a range of interim SCC estimates to use in regulatory analyses until improved SCC 
estimates are developed. The following summary reflects the initial results of these efforts and 
proposes ranges and values for interim social costs of carbon used in this rule. It should be 
emphasized that the analysis described below is preliminary. These complex issues are of course 
undergoing a process of continuing review. Relevant agencies will be evaluating and seeking 
comment on all of the scientific, economic, and ethical issues before establishing final estimates 
for use in future rulemakings.  
The interim judgments resulting from the recent interagency review process can be 
summarized as follows: (a) DOE and other Federal agencies should consider the global benefits 
associated with the reductions of CO2 emissions resulting from efficiency standards and other 
similar rulemakings, rather continuing the previous focus on domestic benefits; (b) these global 
benefits should be based on SCC estimates (in 2007$) of $55, $33, $19, $10, and $5 per ton of 
CO2 equivalent emitted (or avoided) in 2007; (c) the SCC value of emissions that occur (or are 
avoided) in future years should be escalated using an annual growth rate of 3 percent from the 
current values); and (d) domestic benefits are estimated to be approximately 6 percent of the 
global values. These interim judgments are based on the following considerations. 
1.  Global and domestic estimates of SCC. Because of the distinctive nature of the climate 
change problem, estimates of both global and domestic SCC values should be considered, 
but the global measure should be “primary.” This approach represents a departure from 
past practices, which relied, for the most part, on measures of only domestic impacts. As 
a matter of law, both global and domestic values are permissible; the relevant statutory 
provisions are ambiguous and allow the agency to choose either measure. (It is true that 
Federal statutes are presumed not to have extraterritorial effect, in part to ensure that the 
laws of the United States respect the interests of foreign sovereigns. But use of a global 
measure for the SCC does not give extraterritorial effect to Federal law and hence does 
not intrude on such interests.) 
It is true that under OMB guidance, analysis from the domestic perspective is required, 
while analysis from the international perspective is optional. The domestic decisions of 
one nation are not typically based on a judgment about the effects of those decisions on 
other nations. But the climate change problem is highly unusual in the sense that it 
involves (a) a global public good in which (b) the emissions of one nation may inflict 
significant damages on other nations and (c) the United States is actively engaged in 
promoting an international agreement to reduce worldwide emissions.  
In these circumstances, the global measure is preferred. Use of a global measure reflects 
the reality of the problem and is expected to contribute to the continuing efforts of the 
United States to ensure that emission reductions occur in many nations.  
EA-6  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Domestic SCC values are also presented. The development of a domestic SCC is greatly 
complicated by the relatively few region- or country-specific estimates of the SCC in the 
literature. One potential estimate comes from the DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate 
Economy, William Nordhaus) model. In an unpublished paper, Nordhaus (2007) 
produced disaggregated SCC estimates using a regional version of the DICE model. He 
reported a U.S. estimate of $1/tCO2 (2007 value, 2007$), which is roughly 11 percent of 
the global value. 
An alternative source of estimates comes from a recent EPA modeling effort using the 
FUND (Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution, Center for 
Integrated Study of the Human Dimensions of Global Change) model. The resulting 
estimates suggest that the ratio of domestic to global benefits varies with key parameter 
assumptions. With a 3-percent discount rate, for example, the U.S. benefit is about 6 
percent of the global benefit for the “central” (mean) FUND results, while, for the 
corresponding “high” estimates associated with a higher climate sensitivity and lower 
global economic growth, the U.S. benefit is less than 4 percent of the global benefit. With 
a 2-percent discount rate, the U.S. share is about 2 to5 percent of the global estimate. 
Based on this available evidence, a domestic SCC value equal to 6 percent of the global 
damages is used in this rulemaking. This figure is in the middle of the range of available 
estimates from the literature. It is recognized that the 6 percent figure is approximate and 
highly speculative and alternative approaches will be explored before establishing final 
values for future rulemakings. 
2.  Filtering existing analyses. There are numerous SCC estimates in the existing literature, 
and it is legitimate to make use of those estimates to produce a figure for current use. A 
reasonable starting point is provided by the meta-analysis in Richard Tol, “The Social 
Cost of Carbon: Trends, Outliers, and Catastrophes, Economics: The Open-Access, 
Open-Assessment E-Journal,” Vol. 2, 2008-25. http://www.economics-
ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2008-25  (2008). With that starting point, it is 
proposed to “filter” existing SCC estimates by using those that (1) are derived from peer-
reviewed studies; (2) do not weight the monetized damages to one country more than 
those in other countries; (3) use a “business as usual” climate scenario; and (4) are based 
on the most recent published version of each of the three major integrated assessment 
models (IAMs): FUND, DICE and PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect).  
Proposal (1) is based on the view that those studies that have been subject to peer review 
are more likely to be reliable than those that have not been. Proposal (2) is based on a 
principle of neutrality and simplicity; it does not treat the citizens of one nation 
differently on the basis of speculative or controversial considerations. Proposal (3) stems 
from the judgment that as a general rule, the proper way to assess a policy decision is by 
comparing the implementation of the policy against a counterfactual state where the 
policy is not implemented. A departure from this approach would be to consider a more 
dynamic setting in which other countries might implement policies to reduce GHG 
EA-7

emissions at an unknown future date, and the United States could choose to implement 
such a policy now or in the future. 
Proposal (4) is based on three complementary judgments. First, the FUND, PAGE, and 
DICE models now stand as the most comprehensive and reliable efforts to measure the 
damages from climate change. Second, the latest versions of the three IAMs are likely to 
reflect the most recent evidence and learning, and hence they are presumed to be superior 
to those that preceded them. It is acknowledged that earlier versions may contain 
information that is missing from the latest versions. Third, any effort to choose among 
them, or to reject one in favor of the others, would be difficult to defend at this time. In 
the absence of a clear reason to choose among them, it is reasonable to base the SCC on 
all of them.  
The agency is keenly aware that the current IAMs fail to include all relevant information 
about the likely impacts from greenhouse gas emissions. For example, ecosystem
impacts, including species loss, do not appear to be included in at least two of the models. 
Some human health impacts, including increases in food-borne illnesses and in the 
quantity and toxicity of airborne allergens, also appear to be excluded. In addition, there 
has been considerable recent discussion of the risk of catastrophe and of how best to 
account for worst-case scenarios. It is not clear whether the three IAMs take adequate 
account of these potential effects. 
3.  Use a model-weighted average of the estimates at each discount rate. At this time, there 
appears to be no scientifically valid reason to prefer any of the three major IAMs (FUND, 
PAGE, and DICE). Consequently, the estimates are based on an equal weighting of 
estimates from each of the models. Among estimates that remain after applying the filter, 
the average of all estimates within a model is derived. The estimated SCC is then 
calculated as the average of the three model-specific averages. This approach ensures that 
the interim estimate is not biased towards specific models or more prolific authors.  
4.  Apply a 3-percent annual growth rate to the chosen SCC values. SCC is assumed to 
increase over time, because future emissions are expected to produce larger incremental 
damages as physical and economic systems become more stressed as the magnitude of 
climate change increases. Indeed, an implied growth rate in the SCC is produced by most 
studies that estimate economic damages caused by increased GHG emissions in future 
years. But neither the rate itself nor the information necessary to derive its implied value 
is commonly reported. In light of the limited amount of debate thus far about the 
appropriate growth rate of the SCC, applying a rate of 3 percent per year seems 
appropriate at this stage. This value is consistent with the range recommended by IPCC 
(2007) and close to the latest published estimate (Hope, 2008).  
For climate change, one of the most complex issues involves the appropriate discount 
rate. OMB’s current guidance offers a detailed discussion of the relevant issues and calls for 
discount rates of 3 percent and 7 percent. It also permits a sensitivity analysis with low rates for 
intergenerational problems. (“If your rule will have important intergenerational benefits or costs 
you might consider a further sensitivity analysis using a lower but positive discount rate in 
EA-8  
EERE-2008-BT-STD-0012 COMMENT 22
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition to calculating net benefits using discount rates of 3 and 7 percent.”) The SCC is being 
developed within the general context of the current guidance. 
The choice of a discount rate, especially over long periods of time, raises highly 
contested and exceedingly difficult questions of science, economics, philosophy, and law. See, 
e.g., William Nordhaus, “The Challenge of Global Warming (2008); Nicholas Stern, The 
Economics of Climate Change” (2007); “Discounting and Intergenerational Equity” (Paul 
Portney and John Weyant, eds., 1999). Under imaginable assumptions, decisions based on cost-
benefit analysis with high discount rates might harm future generations—at least if investments 
are not made for the benefit of those generations. (See Robert Lind, “Analysis for 
Intergenerational Discounting,” id. at 173, 176–177.) At the same time, use of low discount rates 
for particular projects might itself harm future generations, by ensuring that resources are not 
used in a way that would greatly benefit them. In the context of climate change, questions of 
intergenerational equity are especially important. 
Reasonable arguments support the use of a 3-percent discount rate. First, that rate is 
among the two figures suggested by OMB guidance, and hence it fits with existing National 
policy. Second, it is standard to base the discount rate on the compensation that people receive 
for delaying consumption, and the 3-percent rate is close to the risk-free rate of return, proxied 
by the return on long term inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury Bonds. (In the context of climate 
change, it is possible to object to this standard method for deriving the discount rate.) Although 
these rates are currently closer to 2.5 percent, the use of 3 percent provides an adjustment for the 
liquidity premium that is reflected in these bonds’ returns.  
At the same time, other arguments support use of a 5-percent discount rate. First, that rate 
can also be justified by reference to the level of compensation for delaying consumption, because 
it fits with market behavior with respect to individuals’ willingness to trade off consumption 
across periods as measured by the estimated post-tax average real returns to private investment 
(e.g., the S&P 500). In the climate setting, the 5-percent discount rate may be preferable to the 
riskless rate because it is based on risky investments and the return to projects to mitigate climate 
change is also risky. In contrast, the 3-percent riskless rate may be a more appropriate discount 
rate for projects where the return is known with a high degree of confidence (e.g., highway 
guardrails). 
Second, 5 percent, and not 3 percent, is roughly consistent with estimates implied by 
reasonable inputs to the theoretically derived Ramsey equation, which specifies the optimal time 
path for consumption. That equation specifies the optimal discount rate as the sum of two 
components. The first reflects the fact that consumption in the future is likely to be higher than 
consumption today (even accounting for climate impacts), so diminishing marginal utility 
implies that the same monetary damage will cause a smaller reduction of utility in the future. 
Standard estimates of this term from the economics literature are in the range of 3 to 5 percent. 
The second component reflects the possibility that a lower weight should be placed on utility in 
the future, to account for social impatience or extinction risk, which is specified by a pure rate of 
time preference (PRTP). A conventional estimate of the PRTP is 2 percent. (Some observers 
believe that a principle of intergenerational equity suggests that the PRTP should be close to 
zero.) It follows that discount rate of 5 percent is within the range of values which are able to be

derived from the Ramsey equation, albeit at the low end of the range of estimates usually 
associated with Ramsey discounting. 
It is recognized that the arguments above—for use of market behavior and the Ramsey
equation—face objections in the context of climate change, and of course there are alternative 
approaches. In light of climate change, it is possible that consumption in the future will not be 
higher than consumption today, and if so, the Ramsey equation will suggest a lower figure. Some
people have suggested that a very low discount rate, below 3 percent, is justified in light of the 
ethical considerations calling for a principle of intergenerational neutrality. See Nicholas Stern, 
“The Economics of Climate Change” (2007); for contrary views, see William Nordhaus, The A 
Question of Balance (2008); Martin Weitzman, “Review of the Stern Review on the Economics 
of Climate Change." Journal of Economic Literature, 45(3): 703–724 (2007). Additionally, some
analyses attempt to deal with uncertainty with respect to interest rates over time; a possible 
approach enabling the consideration of such uncertainties is discussed below. Richard Newell 
and William Pizer, “Discounting the Distant Future: How Much do Uncertain Rates Increase 
Valuations?” J. Environ. Econ. Manage. 46 (2003) 52-71. 
The application of the methodology outlined above yields estimates of the SCC that are 
reported in Table EA.1. These estimates are reported separately using 3-percent and 5-percent 
discount rates. The cells are empty in rows 10 and 11 because these studies did not report 
estimates of the SCC at a 3-percent discount rate. The model-weighted means are reported in the 
final or summary row; they are $33 per t CO2 at a 3-percent discount rate and $5 per t CO2 with a 
5-percent discount rate.

DOE has conducted analyses at $33 and $5 per ton as these represent the estimates 
associated with the 3 percent and 5 percent discount rates, respectively. The 3 percent and 5 
percent estimates have independent appeal and at this time a clear preference for one over the 
other is not warranted. Thus, DOE has also included—and centered its current attention on—the 
average of the estimates associated with these discount rates, which is $19. (Based on the $19 
global value, the domestic value would be $1.14 per ton of CO2 equivalent.) 
It is true that there is uncertainty about interest rates over long time horizons. 
Recognizing that point, Newell and Pizer have made a careful effort to adjust for that 
uncertainty. See Newell and Pizer, supra. This is a relatively recent contribution to the literature. 
There are several concerns with using this approach in this context. First, it would be a 
departure from current OMB guidance. Second, an approach that would average what emerges 
from discount rates of 3 percent and 5 percent reflects uncertainty about the discount rate, but 
based on a different model of uncertainty. The Newell-Pizer approach models discount rate 
uncertainty as something that evolves over time; in contrast, one alternative approach would 
assume that there is a single discount rate with equal probability of 3 percent and 5 percent.  
Table EA.2 reports on the application of the Newell-Pizer adjustments. The precise 
numbers depend on the assumptions about the data generating process that governs interest rates. 
Columns (1a) and (1b) assume that “random walk” model best describes the data and uses 3-
percent and 5-percent discount rates, respectively. Columns (2a) and (2b) repeat this, except that 
it assumes a “mean-reverting” process. As Newell and Pizer report, there is stronger empirical 
support for the random walk model.

**Assumes a starting discount rate of 3 percent. Newell and Pizer (2003) based adjustment factors are not applied to
estimates from Guo et al. (2006) that use a different approach to account for discount rate uncertainty (rows 7-8).
The resulting estimates of the social cost of carbon are necessarily greater. When the 
adjustments from the random walk model are applied, the estimates of the social cost of carbon 
are $10 and $55, with the 3 percent and 5 percent discount rates, respectively. The application of 
the mean-reverting adjustment yields estimates of $6 and $36. Since the random walk model has 
greater support from the data, DOE also conducted analyses with the value of the SCC set at $10 
and $55. 
In summary, DOE will consider in its decision process for the notice of proposed 
rulemaking the potential global benefits resulting from reduced CO2 emissions valued at $5, $10, 
$19, $30 and $55 per metric ton, and has also presented the domestic benefits derived using a 
value of $1.14 per metric ton.  
DOE is well aware that scientific and economic knowledge about the contribution of CO2 
and other GHG emissions to changes in the future global climate and the potential resulting 
damages to the world economy continues to evolve rapidly. Thus, any value placed in this 
rulemaking on reducing CO2 emissions is subject to likely change. 
DOE, together with other Federal agencies, is reviewing various methodologies for 
estimating the monetary value of reductions in CO2 and other GHG emissions. This review will 
consider the comments on this subject that are part of the public record for this and other

rulemakings, as well as other methodological assumptions and issues, such as whether the 
appropriate values should represent domestic U.S. benefits, as well as global benefits (and costs). 
Given the complexity of the many issues involved, this review is ongoing.  
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
As discussed earlier, with respect to NOx the CAIR rule has been reinstated by the 
courts. Therefore, NOx emissions in those states covered by CAIR will be subject to a cap with 
corresponding annual allowances openly traded.  DOE’s approach to NOx allowance price 
impacts are discussed below. 
For those states not covered by CAIR, DOE plans on estimating the monetized benefits 
of NOx emissions reductions in these states based on environmental damage estimates from the 
literature. Available estimates suggest a very wide range of monetary values for NOx emissions, 
ranging from $370 per ton to $3,800 per ton of NOx from stationary sources, measured in 2001$ 
or a range of $432 per ton to $4,441 per ton in 2007$.8 
Mercury (Hg)
DOE plans on estimating the monetized benefits of Hg emissions reductions based on 
environmental damage estimates from the literature.  DOE has determined that the basic science 
linking mercury emissions from power plants to impacts on humans is considered highly uncertain.  
However, DOE identified two estimates of the environmental damages of mercury based on two 
estimates of the adverse impact of childhood exposure to methyl mercury on IQ for American 
children, and subsequent loss of lifetime economic productivity resulting from these IQ losses.  
The high-end estimate is based on an estimate of the current aggregate cost of the loss of IQ in 
American children that results from exposure to mercury of U.S. power plant origin ($1.3 billion 
per year in 2000$), which translates to $32.6 million per ton emitted per year (2007$).9  The low-
end estimate was $664,000 per ton emitted in 2004$ or $729,000 per ton in 2007$, which DOE 
derived from a published evaluation of mercury control using different methods and assumptions 
from the first study, but also based on the present value of the lifetime earnings of children 
exposed.10 b 
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) Allowance Prices 
With regard to SO2 emissions, unlike the other pollutants to be considered in this 
analysis, these emissions have for some time been subject to a national cap with corresponding 
annual allowances openly traded; therefore, considerable market experience with these 
instruments has already been accumulated. It has been argued that imposition of any standard 
that lowers U.S. national electricity consumption creates beneficial downward pressure on the 
prices of these allowances, and this cost reduction benefit should be considered in any analysis of 
a proposed standard. While this assertion is fundamentally sound (i.e., reduced electricity 
demand should ceteris paribus bring about lower SO2 and NOx allowance prices) there are a 
myriad of complications impeding any meaningful quantification of any associated benefit.  
b  The estimate was derived by back-calculating the annual benefits per ton from the net present value of benefits
reported in the study.

While complexity of analysis alone clearly cannot justify disregarding a potential consequence of 
a standard, DOE additionally believes these benefits to be both volatile and de minimis when 
compared to the direct effects of a standard as estimated in this analysis. 
Some of the problems to be confronted in an allowance price effect forecast are: 
•  Only any net lowering of the total allowance bill to generators free of transfers is the 
potential source of a benefit. Any such compliance cost saving would need to be 
accurately estimated, and this effect is no different from the benefit derived from a cost 
reduction for other inputs, such as fuel. When the SO2 allowance market that was created 
in 1995 under the Clean Air Act Amendments began, initial allowance allocations were 
directly granted to large affected units based on their historic (1985-87) use of fuel. For 
30 years, allowances for the following year are issued every spring at a declining rate to 
these entitled parties, and thereafter can be freely used, traded, or banked. Some
additional allowances are allocated in diverse ways (e.g. as rewards to generators 
installing control equipment). In other words, the entitled generators holding emission 
rights are losers when the value of allowances declines, while the buyers of allowances 
are gainers. Before they are used, allowances may be traded many times at prices 
reflecting the marginal not average cost of compliance.  
•  The trading system allows for allowance banking. Consequently, any observed change in 
a forecast year could represent the manifestation of market fundamentals but could 
similarly just indicate deposit or withdrawal of allowances. In general, used allowances 
have fallen short of the cap so emissions may exceed the specified cap for future years.
•  Control efforts could further reduce the SO2 cap for some jurisdictions, creating 
regulatory uncertainty that perturbs the allowance market. The issuance of the proposed 
and final CAIR rules were likely contributing factors to allowance price increases leading 
to a dramatic 2005 allowance price spike. While prices had already fallen far below their 
historic highs by the time CAIR was vacated in the summer of 2008, spot allowance 
prices nonetheless made a further precipitous drop following the D.C. Circuit Court 
ruling. 
•  Because allowances can be traded freely by generators, brokers, and investors, they can
serve as financial instruments, and, especially since 2003, allowance prices have been 
volatile. Between 2000, when a tightened Clean Air Amendment cap came into force, 
and 2007, allowances traded between a low of about $120/short ton in 2002 and a high of 
about $1600/short ton, with the 2005 spike being particularly dramatic.11 12  Since there is 
no reason to believe that these conditions will alter over the life of a proposed standard, 
the challenge of forecasting prices is much more complex than a simple supply-demand 
balance might suggest. Also, note that any quantification of the benefit likely depends on 
the level of prices as well as their net change. To believe that a simple delta in the prices 
could be used to estimate the benefit is to believe that the same numerical reduction in 
price would result from the standard whether the prevailing trading price were $100 or 
$1000 per short ton.

With regard to NOx emissions, CAIR has only recently been reinstated by the courts, 
therefore market instruments with regard to NOx are not known.  But DOE is left to presume that 
the same problems that confront an SO2 allowance price effect forecast would also apply to a 
NOx allowance price effect forecast.
As noted earlier, the forecasting tool to be used for this analysis is the AEO2009 version 
of NEMS-BT, which generates forecasts of both SO2 and NOx emissions and allowance prices.  
DOE intends to review the allowance price forecasts and the effect that refrigerator standards 
have on them. If this review suggests that the SO2 and NOx allowance price effects are both 
significant and estimable using NEMS-BT, it may be included in the environmental assessment 
for the notice of proposed rulemaking.  
3.0 RESULTS
The results for the environmental assesssment are similar to a complete NEMS run, as 
published in the AEO2009. These include emissions for SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2 in five-
year forecasted increments, extrapolated to the year 2043.  DOE will report the outcome of the 
analysis for each trial standard level as a deviation from the AEO2009 reference case results.

REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS FOR PROPOSED ENERGY CONSERVATION  
STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL REFRIGERATORS, REFRIGERATOR-
FREEZERS, AND FREEZERS  
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Under the Process Rule (Procedures for Consideration of New or Revised Energy 
Conservation Standards for Consumer Products, 61 FR 36974 (July 15, 1996)), the Department 
of Energy (DOE) is committed to continually explore non-regulatory alternatives to standards.  
DOE will prepare a draft regulatory impact analysis pursuant to E.O. 12866, “Regulatory 
Planning and Review,” which will be subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office 
of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  58 FR 51735. 
DOE has identified six major alternatives to standards as representing feasible policy options to 
achieve customer product energy efficiency.  It will evaluate each alternative in terms of its 
ability to achieve significant energy savings at a reasonable cost, and will compare the 
effectiveness of each one to the effectiveness of the proposed standards rule. 
The non-regulatory means of achieving energy savings that DOE proposes to analyze are 
listed in Table RA.1. The technical support document (TSD) in support of DOE’s notice of 
proposed rulemaking will include a complete quantitative analysis of each alternative, the 
methodology for which is discussed briefly below.

2.0 METHODOLOGY 
DOE will use the National Impact Analysis (NIA) Spreadsheet Models for each of the 
four appliance products to calculate the national energy savings and the net present value (NPV) 
corresponding to each alternative to the proposed standards.  The NIA Spreadsheet Models for 
residential refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers are discussed in Chapter 10 of the 
preliminary TSD.  To compare each alternative quantitatively to the proposed conservation 
standards, DOE will need to quantify the effect of each alternative on the purchase and use of 
energy efficient residential dishwashers, dehumidifiers, and cooking products, and commercial 
clothes washers.  Once it has quantified each alternative, DOE will make the appropriate

revisions to the inputs in the NIA Spreadsheet Models.  Key inputs that DOE may revise in these 
models are: 
•  Energy prices and escalation factors; 
•  Implicit market discount rates for trading off purchase price against operating 
expense when choosing equipment efficiency; 
•  Consumer purchase price, operating cost, and income elasticities; 
•  Consumer price-versus-efficiency relationships; and 
•  Equipment stock data (purchase of new equipment or turnover rates for inventories). 
The key measures of the impact of each alternative will be: 
•  energy use (in exajoules, or 1018 joules): Cumulative energy use of the equipment 
from the effective date of the new standard to the year 2042.  DOE will report 
electricity consumption as primary energy. 
•  National energy savings: Cumulative national energy use from the base case 
projection minus the alternative policy case projection. 
•  Net present value: The value of future operating cost savings from equipment bought 
in the period from the effective date of the new standard (2012) to the year 2042.  
DOE will calculate the NPV as the difference between the present value of equipment 
and operating expenditures (including energy) in the base case, and the present value 
of expenditures in each alternative policy case.  DOE will discount future operating 
and equipment expenditures to 2009 using a seven-percent and three-percent real 
discount rate. It will calculate operating expenses (including energy costs) for the life 
of the equipment.
