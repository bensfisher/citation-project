Fueling the future demand for childcare services is the expected increase in the amount of children below 5 between 2004 and 2014. Adding to this growing demand will be an increased female labor force participation rate, forcing families to find alternate care options for their children. Furthermore, many states will be implementing their own care programs for 3- and 4- year old children in the coming years. The government also plans to increase subsidies for lowincome families attending day care programs (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005). While trends point to increased demand for childcare labor, it is difficult to assess whether this will be accompanied by an increase in the number of facilities, and to what extent these new facilities will be located in pre-1978 buildings. 2.2.1.2 Informal Daycare Informal daycare is provided by unlicensed providers, including relatives, friends, and others.

It is possible in some geographic areas for a small number of firms or a single firm to establish a market niche, but overall the market for renovation services appears to be quite competitive on the supply side. The relatively low barriers to entry in the renovation industry enhance the competition taking place within it. Much of the work covered by this rule does not require particularly unusual or high levels of skills. Renovation work has traditionally attracted recent immigrants because a lack of English is not important (Farzad 2005). While any training required as part of this rule will increase the skill level, the cost of the training is expected to be relatively low. There are also a large number of consumers in the industry. As such, no single consumer of renovation services is expected to exhibit influence over the price of these services. There are three sources of substitutes for renovation services. First, consumers can substitute from one contractor to another. Second, consumers can substitute away from professional renovation and into DIY work. This is less likely to occur for COFs than for residential RRP work</context>

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

These activities may or may not make up the majority of work (i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related (or unrelated) lines of work. The analysis identified 12 NAICS codes that are likely to include the vast majority of construction-related establishments that will be affected by the rule.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 58 percent of the net value of construction work and 50% of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit.

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry.

The indicators include net value of construction (value of construction less value of construction subcontracted out to others) and labor costs. Net value of construction work is used instead of the total value of construction work because it is a measure of the work actually performed by the establishment.

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit.

In 2002, this industry included 28,426 firms that employed 154,725 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry.

The number and size of firms in this industry is described below. 2.3.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics Firms involved in the leasing of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses) are classified under NAICS 531120 – Lessors of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses). In 2002, this industry included 28,426 firms that employed 154,725 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b). Firms involved in the management of non-residential properties are classified under NAICS 531312 – Nonresidential property managers. In 2002, this industry included 10,506 firms that employed 125,616 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).14 Table 2-19 includes only firms with employees.

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry. It is likely that only a small portion of these establishments are involved in lead based paint-related training.

In total, about 3.8 million people work for the 394,365 establishments in the potentially affected industries. About 73 percent of these employees are construction workers. The affected sectors differ in terms of the composition of their labor force. For example, construction workers make up 84 percent of employees in the Drywall and Insulation contractor sector. In the Residential Remodelers sector, however, construction workers make up only 65 percent of the labor force (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c) 2.1.2 Number of Non-Employer Establishments As mentioned above, the U.S. Economic Census tracks non-employer establishments separately from establishments with employees. Data on the number of non-employer establishments were available from the U.S. Small Business Administration. A non-employer firm “is defined as one that has no paid employees, has annual business receipts of $1,000 or more ($1 or more in the construction industries), and is subject to federal income taxes” (U.S. Small Business Administration 2006a).

The indicators include net value of construction (value of construction less value of construction subcontracted out to others) and labor costs.

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit.

Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group of interest. The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time during the year are included. Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a). Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment employment numbers by NAICS code. The average employment numbers are small for all affected sectors. Overall, Other Building Equipment contractors have the largest number of employees per establishment (20.8 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

For both residential and nonresidential building projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs (while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and engineering work, etc). Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations, additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule. Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-26 Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in place for private preschools (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).15 Both real GDP and the value of state and local construction of elementary school buildings substantially increas</context>

While the Census tracks this breakdown between renovation and new building construction for residential construction, it does not for non-residential construction. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, did compile statistics for the expenditures of non-residential improvements in 1986, 1989, and 1992.

According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), “rents fell in 9 of the 27 metropolitan areas tracked by the federal government [in 2003]. Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7</context>

Section 2.8 presents the estimated numbers of target housing COFs affected by the rule. 2.2.2 Public and Private Schools This section describes the number and size of public and private schools with kindergartens and prekindergartens. 2.2.2.1 Number of Schools According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the 2004-2005 academic year, there were 93,295 public schools with students in the United States. In total, these schools served 48.8 million students (NCES 2006a). The rule will apply only to those portions of schools that meet the COF definition. Thus, the rule is expected to primarily impact schools that have kindergarten or prekindergarten programs. According to the NCES’s Public Elementary and Secondary School Universe Survey, which collects data on all operational public schools in the United States, in 2004-2005, 52,129 of the 93,295 U.S. public schools (roughly 56 percent) provided either pre-kindergarten or kindergarten services.9 Of these 52,129 schools, 20,885 offered both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and 29,884 schools provided kinder</context>

The small business definition for the ten specialty contractor industries is $14 million per year (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). The SBA size standards apply to firms rather than establishments; at the time the analysis was performed, revenue data in the 2002 Economic Census was only available at the establishment level. Since a firm may consist of one establishment, a few establishments or even a very large number of establishments, by using establishment rather than firm data, this analysis overestimates the number of small businesses in the affected industry.

According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), “rents fell in 9 of the 27 metropolitan areas tracked by the federal government [in 2003]. Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7</context>

In total, about 3.8 million people work for the 394,365 establishments in the potentially affected industries. About 73 percent of these employees are construction workers. The affected sectors differ in terms of the composition of their labor force. For example, construction workers make up 84 percent of employees in the Drywall and Insulation contractor sector. In the Residential Remodelers sector, however, construction workers make up only 65 percent of the labor force (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c) 2.1.2 Number of Non-Employer Establishments As mentioned above, the U.S. Economic Census tracks non-employer establishments separately from establishments with employees.

The indicators include net value of construction (value of construction less value of construction subcontracted out to others) and labor costs.

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit.

In total, about 3.8 million people work for the 394,365 establishments in the potentially affected industries. About 73 percent of these employees are construction workers. The affected sectors differ in terms of the composition of their labor force. For example, construction workers make up 84 percent of employees in the Drywall and Insulation contractor sector. In the Residential Remodelers sector, however, construction workers make up only 65 percent of the labor force (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c) 2.1.2 Number of Non-Employer Establishments As mentioned above, the U.S. Economic Census tracks non-employer establishments separately from establishments with employees.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-13 While Census covers both family and center-based childcare under NAICS 624410, there is reason to believe that Census undercounts the number of employer firms in this industry. This is likely to occur for two reasons. First, it is likely that the number of firms reported by Census primarily includes centers, since care provided solely by one person (as occurs at many family daycare establishments) would be classified under</context>

Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group of interest. The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time during the year are included. Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a). Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment employment numbers by NAICS code. The average employment numbers are small for all affected sectors. Overall, Other Building Equipment contractors have the largest number of employees per establishment (20.8 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

For both residential and nonresidential building projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs (while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and engineering work, etc). Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations, additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule. Economic Analysis for the LRRP Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule 2-26 Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in place for private preschools (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).15 Both real GDP and the value of state and local construction of elementary school buildings substantially increas</context>

While the Census tracks this breakdown between renovation and new building construction for residential construction, it does not for non-residential construction. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, did compile statistics for the expenditures of non-residential improvements in 1986, 1989, and 1992.

Expenditures on improvement made up between 35 and 58 percent of the total value of construction put in place in either private or state and local nonresidential buildings in the three selected years, with the data moderately variable.

Figure 2-2 indicates that while there have been some fluctuations in the underlying components of the overall market, when considered over the entire time frame, the number of licensed COFs has been relatively stable. While there wasn’t significant growth in childcare over the 1995-2004 timeframe, a study forecasts growth in the demand for childcare labor.

The revenue and employment distribution is less skewed in the Lessor of Residential Buildings and Dwellings sector. Small establishments in this industry contribute about 82 percent of the revenues and employ 86 percent of the workforce (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a). 2.6.3 Industry Outlook The market for lead-safe renovation activities will depend in part on the state of the rental housing market—an increase in rents would provide resources to construct new housing and/or renovate existing 16 Includes establishments open year-round only.

Section 2.8 provides an overview of the structures that would be affected by the revisions to the LRRP rule. 2.1 Contractors that Supply Renovation Services Data from the U.S. Economic Census were used to identify the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry groups that may provide renovation, repair and painting work (U.S. Census Bureau 2004a). An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it derives the greatest share of its revenues. These activities may or may not make up the majority of work (i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related (or unrelated) lines of work. The analysis identified 12 NAICS codes that are likely to include the vast majority of construction-related establishments that will be affected by the rule.

It is worth mentioning that if the Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump to 55 percent. Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 58 percent of the net value of construction work and 50% of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments.

This industry, in turn, is divided into two sub-sectors, NAICS 5311101—Lessors of Apartment Buildings and NAICS 5311109—Lessors of Dwellings Other than Apartment Buildings. According to the 2002 U.S. Economic Census data, together these industries include a total of 61,787 establishments that employ 292,405 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2004b). Establishments involved in the management of residential properties are classified under NAICS 531311—Residential Property Managers. In 2002, this industry included 26,233 establishments that employed 289,870 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2004b).

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

The curriculums offered by these schools are highly structured and specialized and lead to job-specific certification” and these establishments are believed to currently provide training for lead abatement professionals (U.S. Census Bureau 2004p). According to the 2002 Economic Census, there are a total of 3,323 establishments in the U.S. certified as Other Technical and Trade Schools (see Table 2-26). On average, each establishment employs 15.3 people. A striking characteristic is that about 19% of these establishments are exempt from the Federal Income Tax (FIT). Exempt establishments include non-profit organizations and educational institutions such as colleges or universities.

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry.

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry.

Establishments with revenues of less than $10 million account for between 30 and 92 percent of the net value of construction work and between 24 and 91 percent of the total value of business done in each sector. It is worth mentioning that if the Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump to 55 percent. Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 58 percent of the net value of construction work and 50% of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments. Figure 2-1 examines labor and material costs, as well as the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of the total value of business done for the twelve affected sectors.

This industry covers child day care centers (including those located in the provider’s home), pre-school centers, nursery schools and pre-kindergarten centers (except as part of elementary schools). In 2002, Census reported that this industry included over 55,000 firms that employed nearly 752,000 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005d).

The number and size of firms in this industry is described below. 2.3.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics Firms involved in the leasing of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses) are classified under NAICS 531120 – Lessors of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses). In 2002, this industry included 28,426 firms that employed 154,725 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b). Firms involved in the management of non-residential properties are classified under NAICS 531312 – Nonresidential property managers. In 2002, this industry included 10,506 firms that employed 125,616 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).14 Table 2-19 includes only firms with employees. The U.S. Census Bureau does not differentiate between self-employed individuals that lease or manage commercial real estate as opposed to residential buildings. This analysis assumes that non-employers primarily lease residential buildings, rather than commercial property. As such, non-employer establishments a</context>

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry. It is likely that only a small portion of these establishments are involved in lead based paint-related training.

Because daycare centers are only one of many types of establishments renting non-residential space, and because the rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to 1978, the analysis also assumes that each property manager or lessor firm owns only one regulated building.

These 15,753 centers are assumed to be included in the estimated 40,190 elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens. Thus, there are a total of 50,947 pre-1978 daycare centers located outside of elementary schools. According to NCES data on public and private schools, however, an additional 824 pre-1978 schools without kindergartens have a pre-kindergarten program, which brings the total number of buildings accounted for as daycare centers to 51,771 (EPA 2008). 2.8.2.1 Public Schools The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that during the 2004-2005 academic year, there were more than 93,000 public schools in the United States. Of these 93,295 public schools, 52,129 had either a pre-kindergarten (PK) or kindergarten (K) program. The Common Core of Data Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey data was used to calculate the number of private schools with PK or K programs.
