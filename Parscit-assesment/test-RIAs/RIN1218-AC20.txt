Hazard Communication 
AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA), Department of 
Labor. 
ACTION: Proposed rule; request for 
comments. 
SUMMARY: OSHA is proposing to modify 
its existing Hazard Communication 
Standard (HCS) to conform with the 
United Nations’ (UN) Globally 
Harmonized System of Classification 
and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). 
OSHA has made a preliminary 
determination that the proposed 
modifications will improve the quality 
and consistency of information 
provided to employers and employees 
regarding chemical hazards and 
associated protective measures. The 
Agency anticipates this improved 
information will enhance the 
effectiveness of the HCS in ensuring that 
employees are apprised of the chemical 
hazards to which they may be exposed, 
and in reducing the incidence of 
chemical-related occupational illnesses 
and injuries. 
The proposed modifications to the 
standard include revised criteria for 
classification of chemical hazards; 
revised labeling provisions that include 
requirements for use of standardized 
signal words, pictograms, hazard 
statements, and precautionary 
statements; a specified format for safety 
data sheets; and related revisions to 
definitions of terms used in the 
standard, requirements for employee 
training on labels and safety data sheets. 
OSHA is also proposing to modify 
provisions of a number of other 
standards, including standards for 
flammable and combustible liquids, 
process safety management, and most 
substance-specific health standards, to 
ensure consistency with the modified 
HCS requirements. 
DATES: Written comments. Written 
comments, including comments on the 
information collection determination 
described in Section VIII of the 
preamble (OMB Review under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995), must

XVIII. Proposed Amendments 
In the preamble, OSHA references a 
number of supporting materials. 
References to these materials are given 
as ‘‘Document ID#’’ followed by the last 
four digits of the document number. The 
referenced materials are posted in 
Docket No. OSHA–H022K–2006–0062 
(which is available at http:// 
www.regulations.osha.gov). The 
documents are also available at the 
OSHA Docket Office (see ADDRESSES 
section above). For further information 
about accessing documents referenced 
in this Federal Register notice, see 
Section XIV (Public Participation— 
Notice of Hearing). 
II. Issues 
OSHA requests comment on all 
relevant issues, including economic 
impact and feasibility, environmental 
impact, effects on small entities, 
proposed revisions to the HCS, and 
subsequent modifications to other 
standards. OSHA has received many 
comments on the issues raised in the 
Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (ANPR) (71 FR 53617, 
September 12, 2006), and the Agency 
has considered those comments in the 
development of this proposal. This 
section identifies issues on which the 
Agency seeks additional information 
and comment to supplement that 
received in response to the ANPR, as 
well as new topics related to this 
proposal. While new comments are 
welcome, OSHA requests that 
comments submitted in response to the 
ANPR not be resubmitted as they are 
retained in the rulemaking record and 
reconsidered throughout the process. 
OSHA is including these issues at the 
beginning of the document to assist 
readers as they consider the comments 
they plan to submit. However, to fully 
understand the questions and provide 
substantive input in response to them, 
the parts of the preamble that address 
these issues in detail should be read and 
reviewed. These include Section VII, 
which addresses the impacts of the 
NPRM, and thus provides the 
background related questions 2 through 
5. Section XV provides the Summary 
and Explanation of the proposed 
regulatory text, and Section XVII is the 
text itself. These are key to 
understanding questions 6 through 26. It 
should be noted that the Federal 
Register’s required format for a 
modification of an existing standard 
does not allow the Agency to provide 
the full text of the rule, i.e., the 
regulatory text in this document only 
addresses those paragraphs that OSHA 
is proposing to change. Therefore, the 
Agency is putting a marked up version 
of the text of the current rule on its web 
page to help readers understand the 
proposed changes in context. The 
marked up text will be found on 
www.osha.gov under Hazard 
Communication in the subject index. 
OSHA requests that comments be 
organized, to the extent possible, around 
the following issues and numbered 
questions. Submitting comments in an 
organized manner and with clear 
reference to the issue raised will enable 
all participants to easily see what issues 
the commenter addressed and how they 
were addressed. This is particularly 
important in a rulemaking such as GHS 
which affects many diverse industries. 
Many commenters, especially small 
businesses, are likely to confine their 
interest (and comment) to the issues that 
affect them, and they will benefit from 
being able to quickly identify comment 
on their issues in others’ submissions. 
Of course, OSHA also welcomes 
relevant comments concerning the 
proposal that fall outside the issue 
questions raised in this section. 
However, the Agency is particularly 
interested in receiving public responses, 
supported by evidence and reasons, to 
the following questions: 
Need and Support for the Standard 
1. OSHA has made a preliminary 
determination that the proposed 
modifications to the HCS would 
increase the quality and consistency of 
information provided to employers and 
employees. Specifically, OSHA believes 
that standardized label elements would 
be more effective in communicating 
hazard information; standardized 
headings and a consistent order of 
information would improve the utility 
of SDSs; and training would support 
and enhance the effectiveness of the 
new label and SDS requirements. Is this 
assessment correct? OSHA requests 
information that reflects on the 
effectiveness of the proposed 
modifications to the HCS in protecting 
employees from chemical hazards in the 
workplace. 
Economic Impacts and Economic 
Feasibility 
2. The preliminary economic analysis 
in Section VII raises a variety of specific 
questions and issues with respect to the 
preliminary economic analysis. OSHA 
would appreciate it if you could place 
answers to these issues as heading 2 in 
your comments and further organize 
comments on the preliminary economic 
analysis (PEA) as follows: 
a. Industrial profiles. This covers 
issues concerning how many 
employees, establishments and products 
would be affected by the proposed 
standard. OSHA welcomes comments 
on all aspects of the industrial profile 
and is particularly interested in 
comments on the number of affected 
employees, and the number of SDSs that 
would need revision, by industry. 
b. Issues with respect to estimated 
benefits of the proposed standard. 
OSHA considers three kinds of benefits 
in this preliminary analysis: Benefits 
associated with preventing injuries, 
illnesses, and fatalities through clearer 
and more accessible information; 
benefits associated with reducing the 
time that safety and health managers 
and logistics and emergency response 
personnel spend on hazardous 
chemicals through clearer and easier-to- 
find information; and benefits 
associated with reducing the time 
needed to develop and review SDSs 
because of international harmonization. 
OSHA is particularly interested in 
comments on the scope of these 
benefits; the extent to which they are 
already being achieved by existing 
practices; and the extent to which they 
depend on other countries following the 
harmonization effort. 
c. Issues with respect to the costs and 
range of costs of the proposed standard. 
OSHA preliminarily estimated the 
principal costs of the standard to 
chemical producers for reclassification 
of chemicals; remaking SDS’s; and 
redoing labels; and to chemical users for 
familiarization and program changes for 
managers and for training exposed 
employees. OSHA welcomes comments 
on all aspects of the costs, and is 
particularly interested in comments on 
the extent to which chemical producers 
may have already met some of the 
requirements of the standard and the 
time and professional skills needed for 
the activities the standard would 
require. 
d. Issues with respect to economic 
impacts and feasibility of the proposed 
standard, including the sensitivity of 
OSHA’s economic feasibility 
determination with respect to various 
assumptions. OSHA welcomes 
comments on all aspects of the 
economic impact and economic 
feasibility analyses. 
e. All other issues with respect to the 
PEA. 
Effects on Small Entities 
3. OSHA has certified that the 
proposed standard will not have a

significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. Nevertheless, 
because of the number of small entities 
affected, OSHA has prepared a 
voluntary initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis, the results of which are 
described in Section VII of the proposed 
rule. Do you consider the estimated 
costs and impacts on small entities 
presented there to be reasonable? Why 
or why not? 
4. Are there alternatives to the rule as 
a whole or specific requirements of the 
rule that reduce impacts on small 
entities while still protecting the health 
of employees and meeting the broad 
goal of a globally harmonized system? 
Environmental Impacts 
5. OSHA has preliminarily 
determined that the proposed standard 
will not have any adverse effects on the 
environment, and may have positive 
effects on the environment. OSHA 
welcomes comments on this 
determination. 
Hazard Classification 
6. OSHA is proposing to adopt all of 
the physical and health hazard classes 
in the GHS. Among the physical and 
health hazard classes, OSHA is 
proposing to include all hazard 
categories in the GHS except Acute 
Toxicity Category 5 for oral, dermal, or 
inhalation exposures; Skin Corrosion/ 
Irritation Category 3; and Aspiration 
Hazard Category 2. If you believe that 
the exclusion of these hazard categories 
is not consistent with the scope and/or 
level of protection provided by the 
current HCS, please describe any 
recommended changes to this proposal 
and the reasons you think these changes 
are necessary. 
7. OSHA has proposed a definition for 
unclassified hazards be added to the 
HCS to ensure that all hazards currently 
covered by the HCS—or new hazards 
that are identified in the future—are 
included in the scope of the revised 
standard until such time as specific 
criteria for the effect are added to the 
GHS and subsequently adopted by 
OSHA. Will this approach provide 
sufficient interim coverage for hazards 
such as combustible dust? Are there 
other hazards for which criteria should 
be developed and added to the GHS? 
Please provide information regarding 
these hazards, and the information 
available to characterize them. 
8. OSHA believes it may be more 
appropriate to add specific coverage for 
simple asphyxiants to the standard in 
the final rule to ensure everyone 
properly addresses their coverage rather 
than addressing them under the 
unclassified hazard definition. This 
effect is simple and straightforward, and 
could be addressed in a definition that 
does not involve extensive criteria. 
OSHA is requesting comment on this 
approach. A possible definition would 
be as follows: 
‘‘Simple asphyxiants’’ are substances that 
displace oxygen in the ambient atmosphere, 
and can thus cause oxygen deprivation in 
exposed workers that leads to 
unconsciousness and death. They are of 
particular concern in confined spaces. 
Examples of asphyxiants include: nitrogen, 
helium, argon, propane, neon, carbon 
dioxide, and methane. 
OSHA would also like to solicit 
comments on specific label elements for 
simple asphyxiants. No symbol would 
be required, but the signal word 
‘‘warning’’ would be used, with the 
hazard statement ‘‘may be harmful if 
inhaled’’. In addition, a precautionary 
statement such as the following would 
be required: May displace oxygen in 
breathing air and lead to suffocation and 
death, particularly in confined spaces. 
All other requirements of the standard 
that apply to hazardous chemicals 
would also apply to chemicals that meet 
this definition. These substances would 
generally be covered already under the 
proposed rule as compressed gases, and 
may also pose other effects such as 
flammability that would have to be 
addressed as well. They are also already 
covered under the existing HCS. Is the 
definition suggested by OSHA sufficient 
to cover this effect? Do you have 
suggestions for modifying this 
definition? Are the label elements 
suggested appropriate? 
9. In order to help to ensure that 
health hazard determinations are 
properly conducted under a 
performance-oriented approach, the 
HCS includes a ‘‘floor’’ of chemicals 
that are to be considered hazardous 
based on several cited reference lists. In 
addition, the existence of one 
toxicological study indicating a possible 
adverse effect is considered sufficient 
for a finding of hazard for any health 
effect. Under the GHS, there is no floor 
of chemicals cited, nor is there an 
across-the-board provision such as the 
one-study criterion. Instead, specific, 
detailed criteria are provided for each 
type of health hazard to guide the 
evaluation of relevant data and 
subsequent classification of the 
chemical. The proposed modifications 
to the HCS would align the standard to 
the GHS approach, and thus do not 
include the floor of chemicals nor the 
universal one-study rule. Would the 
proposed detailed criteria provide 
sufficient guidance for a thorough 
hazard evaluation? 
10. OSHA has edited the chapters in 
the GHS for classification of physical 
and health hazards to remove material 
not directly related to classification and 
to otherwise streamline the text. OSHA 
anticipates providing the decision logics 
separately to serve as guidance, but has 
not included them in the regulatory text. 
Are there any additions, subtractions, or 
clarifications of the classification 
criteria from the GHS that OSHA needs 
to consider? 
11. Certain physical hazard 
classification criteria (i.e., for self- 
reactive chemicals, organic peroxides, 
self-heating chemicals, explosives) 
either directly reference packaging or 
quantity, or rely on test methods that 
reference packaging or quantity. The 
criteria were developed for transport 
concerns. Clearly, quantity and 
packaging can greatly affect safe 
transport of chemicals that pose hazards 
such as those listed above. However, 
OSHA seeks comments on whether the 
criteria as stated in the GHS are 
appropriate for the workplace. Does use 
of these criteria present any obstacles to 
classification or create any difficulties 
for suppliers or users of chemicals? 
Describe any difficulties these criteria 
may present and any suggestions for 
addressing these issues, particularly 
recommendations that would be 
consistent with the GHS and maintain 
the GHS level of safety for these 
chemicals. 
12. The GHS gives countries guidance 
on a cut-off or concentration limit for 
chemical mixtures containing target 
organ toxicity hazards. In Appendix A, 
Section A.8.3, OSHA is proposing to 
make the suggested 20% concentration 
limit mandatory so that label preparers 
are clear on what needs to be done. 
Please comment on whether this 
mandatory concentration limit is 
appropriate. If you have an alternative, 
please provide it along with the 
rationale. 
Labels 
13. The proposal would require 
pictograms to have a red frame. As 
discussed in Section V, OSHA believes 
that use of the color red will make 
warnings more noticeable and will aid 
in communicating the presence of a 
hazard. However, the GHS gives 
competent authorities such as OSHA the 
discretion to allow use of a black frame 
when the pictogram appears on a label 
for a package which will not be 
exported. For packages that will not be 
exported, should the modified standard 
allow black frames on pictograms, or 
should the pictogram frame be required 
to be presented in red?

50283 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
14. In addition to the pictograms, 
signal word and hazard statements, GHS 
labels must include precautionary 
statements. OSHA is proposing to 
require the text in the precautionary 
statements in the GHS to be on HCS 
labels. As discussed in Section XV 
Summary and Explanation of the 
Proposed Standard, these statements are 
codified under the GHS, meaning that 
numbers have been assigned to them. In 
addition, the appropriate statements to 
use for each hazard class and category 
have been indicated in the GHS 
annexes. This means that label 
preparers will know exactly what 
precautionary statements to apply once 
they complete their hazard 
classification, and chemical users will 
see consistent language on labels to 
indicate the necessary precautionary 
measures. However, the statements are 
not yet considered to be part of the 
harmonized text like hazard statements 
are; rather they are included in the GHS 
as an suggested language. OSHA expects 
that other countries may adopt the 
codified precautionary statements when 
they put GHS in place. For example the 
EU has required that labels use the GHS 
codified precautionary statement text in 
adapting the GHS. Since OSHA did not 
previously require the use of 
precautionary statements, and had no 
such recommended statements to 
provide, the Agency is proposing to use 
those currently in the GHS as the 
mandatory requirements with the option 
of consolidating statements where 
appropriate (See Appendix C). OSHA 
anticipates this approach will provide 
the maximum benefit. OSHA is also 
seeking comment on whether any of 
these statements should be modified or 
if other precautionary statements should 
be included. 
In addition, as discussed in Section 
IV, OSHA has presented other 
alternatives with regards to 
precautionary statements, and OSHA is 
soliciting comment on these options as 
well. Specifically, OSHA is seeking 
feedback on whether the Agency should 
include the GHS precautionary 
statements as nonbinding examples, 
through a non mandatory appendix or 
guidance, rather than as required 
statements, or whether OSHA should 
allow label preparers to develop their 
own precautionary statements rather 
than specifying the text to be used. 
15. OSHA has not proposed to require 
the exploding bomb pictogram or 
specific precautionary statements for 
Division 1.4S ammunition and 
ammunition components because the 
specified GHS label elements may not 
accurately reflect the hazards of these 
materials. Is this sufficiently protective? 
Are any adjustments to the label 
elements for Division 1.4S ammunition 
and ammunition components 
necessary? Describe any requested 
changes and explain why such revisions 
are necessary. 
16. In the current HCS, OSHA has a 
provision that requires labels to be 
updated within three months of 
obtaining new and significant 
information about the hazards. The 
Agency has not been enforcing this 
provision for many years, and there has 
been an administrative stay on 
enforcement. OSHA is including the 
provision in this proposal, and inviting 
comment on it with the intention of 
including it in the final rule and lifting 
the stay. Is three months the appropriate 
time interval for updating? Are there 
any practical accommodations that need 
to accompany this limit (for example, 
related to stockpiles of chemicals)? 
Provide any alternatives you consider 
appropriate, as well as documentation 
to support them. 
Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) 
17. As discussed in Section XV, the 
Agency is proposing to require that 
OSHA permissible exposure limits 
(PELs) be included on the SDS, as well 
as any other exposure limit used or 
recommended by the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer 
preparing the safety data sheet. OSHA 
welcomes comments on this approach, 
along with an explanation of the basis 
for your position. 
18. OSHA is proposing that Section 
15 of the SDS be non-mandatory. As 
indicated in Appendix D, Section 15 
addresses regulatory information 
concerning the chemical. OSHA is 
considering requiring the substance 
specific standards be referenced in this 
section, which would make Section 15 
mandatory. Would employers and 
employees benefit from having this 
information in this section of the SDS? 
Other Standards Affected 
19. OSHA is proposing to align the 
definitions of the physical hazards to 
the requirements of the GHS categories 
in safety standards for general industry, 
construction, and maritime standards, 
which either directly reference the HCS 
or provide information pertinent to the 
Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). In most cases 
OSHA has modified the standards to 
maintain scope and protection. 
However, the changes in definitions for 
flammable liquids Category 1 and 2 and 
flammable aerosols appear to be more 
than simply rounding to the nearest 
significant number. 
Æ Flammable liquids Category 1 and 
2: The boiling point cut-off for Category 
1 is reduced from 100 deg F (37.8 deg 
C) or less to 95 deg F (35 deg C) or less, 
which could shift some liquids from 
Category 1 to Category 2. 
Æ Flammable aerosols: OSHA is 
proposing to adopt the GHS method to 
determine flammability rather than the 
method defined by the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC). 
OSHA’s decision to change these 
definitions to be consistent with the 
GHS is based not only upon 
harmonizing its standards with those of 
other countries that have adopted or 
may adopt the GHS, but OSHA is also 
concerned with making its standards 
internally consistent. OSHA believes the 
methods used to classify these physical 
hazards are similar enough so that 
substances that are currently regulated 
by OSHA would continue to be 
regulated and that few, if any, changes 
would result in a shift in regulatory 
coverage. Would the proposed changes 
have any impact on your operations? If 
so, describe the anticipated effects. 
20. OSHA is proposing to eliminate 
the term ‘‘combustible liquid’’ in 29 
CFR 1910.106. 1910.107, 1910.123, 
1910.124, 1910.125, and 1926.155 for 
liquids with a flashpoint above 100 °F. 
To reflect consistency with the revised 
HCS where appropriate, OSHA is 
proposing to add the specific flashpoint 
criteria. This will maintain equivalent 
protection. Are there other standards 
that OSHA should update with the new 
terminology? 
21. OSHA is proposing to modify the 
language required on signs in substance- 
specific health standards. The Agency 
developed the proposed language to 
reflect the terminology of the revised 
HCS while, at the same time, providing 
adequate warning through language that 
is consistent with the current sign 
requirements for these chemicals. An 
added benefit is the hazard warnings on 
signs specified for these standards will 
now be consistent throughout OSHA 
standards. For example, all carcinogens 
will now bear the hazard statement 
‘‘MAY CAUSE CANCER’’. OSHA 
believes that providing language that is 
consistent on both signs and labels will 
improve comprehension for employees. 
Does the proposed language on signs 
accurately convey the hazards? 
22. OSHA is proposing to revise the 
substance-specific health standards’ 
provisions on labeling for producers and 
importers of chemicals and substances. 
Currently in the substance-specific 
standards OSHA requires specific 
language on labels for certain chemicals. 
OSHA is proposing to change these 
labeling requirements by referring those 
responsible for labeling to the modified 
HCS and including in each substance-

specific standard a list of health effects 
that must be considered for hazard 
classification. The modified HCS will 
dictate the specific language (i.e., signal 
word, hazard statement(s), and 
precautionary statement(s)) that is 
required on labels through the 
classification process. However, OSHA 
is proposing to maintain specific 
language for labels on contaminated 
clothing and waste/debris containers to 
ensure adequate hazard communication 
for the downstream recipients. How 
would the removal of required language 
for labels from substance-specific 
standards affect your work place? Are 
there hazard warnings that will be lost 
that do not have an equivalent hazard or 
precautionary statement? Are there 
alternatives to OSHA’s approach for the 
substance-specific standards that will 
assure information is disseminated in a 
manner that is consistent with the 
modified HCS labeling requirements? 
23. In determining the health hazards 
that need to be considered by 
manufacturers, importers and 
distributors when classifying chemicals 
regulated by the substance-specific 
standards, OSHA is proposing to 
primarily rely on the determinations 
made by the Agency in each 
rulemaking, the NIOSH Pocket Guide to 
Chemical Hazards (2005) and the 
International Chemical Safety Cards, 
and use as a secondary source the health 
effects identified by the European 
Commission (2007). OSHA is proposing 
to include a health hazard only if it is 
identified as such by two or more of 
these organizations. Are there other 
sources of information that OSHA 
should consult? 
24. As detailed in the Summary and 
Explanation section of this document, 
OSHA is not proposing in this 
rulemaking to update the electrical 
standards (general industry 1910 
subpart S and construction 1926 subpart 
K) or Explosives and blasting agents 
(general industry 1910.109 and 
construction 1926.914). These subparts 
are ‘‘self-contained’’ in that they do not 
rely on other OSHA standards for 
regulatory scope or definitions, but 
reference external organizations (such as 
the National Fire Protection Association 
[NFPA]). OSHA believes that these 
standards could be updated when the 
referenced external organizations adopt 
applicable GHS elements. If OSHA were 
to change these standards to comply 
with the GHS, how would this impact 
your operations? 
Effective Dates 
25. OSHA has proposed to require 
that employers train employees 
regarding the new labels and safety data 
sheets within two years after 
publication of the final rule to ensure 
they are familiar with the new approach 
when they begin to see new labels and 
SDSs in their workplaces. Is the 
proposed time appropriate? 
26. OSHA has proposed that chemical 
manufacturers, importers, distributors, 
and employers be required to comply 
with all provisions of the modified final 
rule within three years after its 
publication. Does this allow adequate 
time to review hazard classifications 
and amend them as necessary, and to 
revise labels and safety data sheets to 
reflect the new requirements? Would a 
shorter time frame be sufficient? 
27. Are there any other factors that 
should be considered in establishing the 
phase-in period? 
Compliance Assistance and Outreach 
28. OSHA received many comments 
in response to the questions in the 
ANPR regarding compliance assistance 
and outreach and is seeking additional 
comment in this proposal. However, 
comments already submitted need not 
be resubmitted. Please refer to the 
discussion in Section XV. Specifically, 
OSHA is interested in your responses to 
the following: What types of materials 
or products would best assist employers 
in understanding and complying with 
the modified HCS? OSHA seeks input to 
identify the tools that would be most 
useful to employers and employees, the 
subjects of greatest interest (e.g., 
classification criteria, labels, safety data 
sheets), and the best means of 
distributing these materials. 
29. OSHA received a number of 
comments that suggested that a data 
base of chemical classifications should 
be developed and maintained to assist 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
in performing hazard classifications. 
This approach has been adopted in 
some other countries. Would such a 
data base be helpful? Who would be 
responsible for doing the classifications 
and maintaining them? How would the 
data base be kept aligned with other 
countries’ classifications? 
Alternative Approaches 
30. OSHA has described alternatives 
to the scope and application of the 
proposed rule in the preamble, Section 
IV. These include consideration of 
allowing voluntary implementation of 
the GHS; exemptions based on size of 
the business; adopting some 
components of the GHS but not others; 
and not adopting all of the required 
label elements. The Agency requests 
comments on these alternatives, with 
data to support the views expressed. 
Suggestions and support for other 
alternatives are requested as well. 
III. Events Leading to the Proposed 
Modifications to the Hazard 
Communication Standard 
OSHA’s Hazard Communication 
Standard (HCS) (29 CFR 1910.1200; 
1915.1200; 1917.28; 1918.90; and 
1926.59) was first issued in 1983 and 
covered the manufacturing sector of 
industry (48 FR 53280, November 25, 
1983). In 1987, the Agency expanded 
the scope of coverage to all industries 
where employees are potentially 
exposed to hazardous chemicals (52 FR 
31852, August 24, 1987). Although full 
implementation in the non- 
manufacturing sector was delayed by 
various court and administrative 
actions, the rule has been fully enforced 
in all industries covered by OSHA since 
March 17, 1989 (54 FR 6886, February 
15, 1989). In 1994, OSHA made a 
number of minor changes and technical 
amendments to the HCS to help ensure 
full compliance and achieve better 
protection of employees (59 FR 6126, 
February 9, 1994). The development of 
the HCS is discussed in detail in the 
preambles to the original and revised 
final rules (see 48 FR 53280–53281; 52 
FR 31852–31854; and 59 FR 6127– 
6131). This discussion will focus on the 
sequence of events leading to the 
development of the Globally 
Harmonized System of Classification 
and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) and 
the modifications to the HCS included 
in this proposed rule. 
The HCS requires chemical 
manufacturers and importers to evaluate 
the chemicals they produce or import to 
determine if they are hazardous. The 
rule provides definitions of health and 
physical hazards to use as the criteria 
for determining hazards in the 
evaluation process. Information about 
hazards and protective measures is then 
required to be conveyed to downstream 
employers and employees through 
labels on containers and safety data 
sheets. All employers with hazardous 
chemicals in their workplaces are 
required to have a hazard 
communication program, including 
container labels, safety data sheets, and 
employee training. (Note: The HCS uses 
the term ‘‘material safety data sheet’’ or 
‘‘MSDS’’, while the GHS uses ‘‘safety 
data sheet’’ or ‘‘SDS’’. For convenience 
and for consistency with the GHS, safety 
data sheet or SDS is being used 
throughout this document and that term 
would replace MSDS in the modified 
HCS.) 
To protect employees and members of 
the public who are potentially exposed 
to chemicals during their production,

50285 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
transportation, use, and disposal, a 
number of countries have developed 
laws that require information about 
those chemicals to be prepared and 
transmitted to affected parties. These 
laws vary with regard to the scope of 
chemicals covered, definitions of 
hazards, the specificity of requirements 
(e.g., specification of a format for safety 
data sheets), and the use of symbols and 
pictograms. The inconsistencies 
between the various laws are substantial 
enough that different labels and safety 
data sheets must often be developed for 
the same product when it is marketed in 
different nations. 
Within the U.S., several regulatory 
authorities exercise jurisdiction over 
chemical hazard communication. In 
addition to OSHA’s HCS, the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) 
regulates chemicals in transport, the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission 
(CPSC) regulates consumer products, 
and the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) regulates pesticides, as 
well as having other authority over 
labeling under the Toxic Substances 
Control Act. Each of these regulatory 
authorities operates under different 
statutory mandates, and has adopted 
distinct hazard communication 
requirements. 
Tracking the hazard communication 
requirements of different regulatory 
authorities is a burden for 
manufacturers, importers, distributors, 
and transporters engaged in commerce 
in the domestic arena. This burden is 
magnified by the need to develop 
multiple sets of labels and safety data 
sheets for each product in international 
trade. Small businesses may have 
particular difficulty in coping with the 
complexities and costs involved. The 
problems associated with differing 
national and international requirements 
were recognized and discussed when 
the HCS was first issued in 1983. The 
preamble to the final rule included a 
commitment by OSHA to review the 
standard regularly to address 
international harmonization of hazard 
communication requirements. OSHA 
was asked to include this commitment 
in recognition of an interagency trade 
policy that supported the U.S. pursuing 
international harmonization of 
requirements for chemical classification 
and labeling. The potential benefits of 
harmonization were noted in the 
preamble: 
* * * [O]SHA acknowledges the long-term 
benefit of maximum recognition of hazard 
warnings, especially in the case of containers 
leaving the workplace which go into 
interstate and international commerce. The 
development of internationally agreed 
standards would make possible the broadest 
recognition of the identified hazards while 
avoiding the creation of technical barriers to 
trade and reducing the costs of dissemination 
of hazard information by elimination of 
duplicative requirements which could 
otherwise apply to a chemical in commerce. 
As noted previously, these regulations will 
be reviewed on a regular basis with regard to 
similar requirements which may be evolving 
in the United States and in foreign countries. 
(48 FR 53287) 
OSHA has actively participated in a 
number of such efforts in the years since 
that commitment was made, including 
trade-related discussions on the need for 
harmonization with major U.S. trading 
partners. The Agency also issued a 
Request for Information (RFI) in the 
Federal Register in January 1990 to 
obtain input regarding international 
harmonization efforts, and on work 
being done at that time by the 
International Labor Organization (ILO) 
to develop a convention and 
recommendations on safety in the use of 
chemicals at work (55 FR 2166, January 
22, 1990). On a closely related matter, 
OSHA published an RFI in May 1990 
requesting comments and information 
on improving the effectiveness of 
information transmitted under the HCS 
(55 FR 20580, May 17, 1990). Possible 
development of a standardized format or 
order of information was raised as an 
issue in the RFI. Nearly 600 comments 
were received in response to this 
request. The majority of responses 
expressed support for a standard SDS 
format, and the majority of responses 
that expressed an opinion on the topic 
favored a standardized format for labels 
as well. 
In June 1992, the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and 
Development issued a mandate (Chapter 
19 of Agenda 21), supported by the U.S., 
calling for development of a globally 
harmonized chemical classification and 
labeling system: 
A globally harmonized hazard 
classification and compatible labelling 
system, including material safety data sheets 
and easily understandable symbols, should 
be available, if feasible, by the year 2000. 
This international mandate initiated a 
substantial effort to develop the GHS, 
involving numerous international 
organizations, many countries, and 
extensive stakeholder representation. 
A coordinating group comprised of 
countries, stakeholder representatives, 
and international organizations was 
established to manage the work. This 
group, the Inter-Organization 
Programme for the Sound Management 
of Chemicals Coordinating Group for the 
Harmonization of Chemical 
Classification Systems, established 
overall policy for the work and assigned 
tasks to other organizations to complete. 
The Coordinating Group then took the 
work of these organizations and 
integrated it to form the GHS. OSHA 
served as chair of the Coordinating 
Group. 
The work was divided into three main 
parts: Classification criteria for physical 
hazards; classification criteria for health 
and environmental hazards (including 
criteria for mixtures); and hazard 
communication elements, including 
requirements for labels and safety data 
sheets. The criteria for physical hazards 
were developed by a United Nations 
Subcommittee of Experts on the 
Transport of Dangerous Goods/ 
International Labour Organization 
working group and were based on the 
already harmonized criteria for the 
transport sector. The criteria for 
classification of health and 
environmental hazards were developed 
under the auspices of the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and 
Development. The ILO developed the 
hazard communication elements. OSHA 
participated in all of this work, and 
served as U.S. lead on classification of 
mixtures and hazard communication. 
Four major existing systems served as 
the primary basis for development of the 
GHS. These systems were the 
requirements in the U.S. for the 
workplace, consumers and pesticides; 
the requirements of Canada for the 
workplace, consumers and pesticides; 
European Union directives for 
classification and labeling of substances 
and preparations; and the United 
Nations Recommendations on the 
Transport of Dangerous Goods. The 
requirements of other systems were also 
examined as appropriate, and taken into 
account as the GHS was developed. The 
primary approach to reconciling these 
systems involved identifying the 
relevant provisions in each system; 
developing background documents that 
compared, contrasted, and explained 
the rationale for the provisions; and 
undertaking negotiations to find an 
agreed approach that addressed the 
needs of the countries and stakeholders 
involved. Principles to guide the work 
were established, including an 
agreement that protections of the 
existing systems would not be reduced 
as a result of harmonization. Thus 
countries could be assured that the 
existing protections of their systems 
would be maintained or enhanced in the 
GHS. 
An interagency committee under the 
auspices of the Department of State 
coordinated U.S. involvement in the 
development of the GHS. In addition to 
OSHA, DOT, CPSC, and EPA, there 
were a number of other agencies

involved that had interests related to 
trade or other aspects of the GHS 
process. Different agencies took the lead 
in various parts of the discussions. 
Positions for the U.S. in these 
negotiations were coordinated through 
the interagency committee. Interested 
stakeholders were kept informed 
through e-mail dissemination of 
information, as well as periodic public 
meetings. In addition, the Department of 
State published a notice in the Federal 
Register that described the 
harmonization activities, the agencies 
involved, the principles of 
harmonization, and other information, 
as well as invited public comment on 
these issues (62 FR 15951, April 3, 
1997). Stakeholders also actively 
participated in the discussions at the 
international level and were able to 
present their views directly in the 
negotiating process. 
The GHS was formally adopted by the 
new United Nations Committee of 
Experts on the Transport of Dangerous 
Goods and the Globally Harmonized 
System of Classification and Labelling 
of Chemicals in December 2002. In 
2003, the adoption was endorsed by the 
Economic and Social Council of the 
United Nations. The GHS will be 
updated as necessary to reflect new 
technology and scientific developments, 
or provide additional explanatory text. 
This proposed rule is based on Revision 
3 of the GHS, published in 2009. 
Countries have been encouraged to 
implement the GHS as soon as possible, 
and established a goal to have fully 
operational systems by 2008. This goal 
was adopted by countries in the 
Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical 
Safety, and was endorsed by the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development. 
The U.S. participated in these groups, 
and agreed to work toward achieving 
these goals. While much progress was 
made by the U.S. and other countries by 
the end of 2008, most are still in the 
process of implementing the GHS. 
OSHA published an Advance Notice 
of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on the 
GHS in September of 2006 (71 FR 
53617, September 12, 2006). The ANPR 
provided information about the GHS 
and its potential impact on the HCS, 
and sought input from the public on 
issues related to GHS implementation. 
Over 100 responses were received, and 
the comments and information provided 
were taken into account in the 
development of the modifications to the 
HCS included in this proposed rule. At 
the same time the ANPR was published, 
OSHA made a document summarizing 
the GHS available on its Web site 
(http://www.osha.gov). 
OSHA remains engaged in a number 
of activities related to the GHS. The U.S. 
is a member of both the United Nations 
Committee of Experts on the Transport 
of Dangerous Goods and the Globally 
Harmonized System of Classification 
and Labeling of Chemicals, as well as 
the Subcommittee of Experts on the 
Globally Harmonized System of 
Classification and Labeling of 
Chemicals. These permanent UN bodies 
have international responsibility for 
maintaining, updating as necessary, and 
overseeing the implementation of the 
GHS. OSHA and other affected Federal 
agencies actively participate in these 
UN groups. In addition, OSHA and EPA 
also participate in the GHS Programme 
Advisory Group under the United 
Nations Institute for Training and 
Research (UNITAR). UNITAR is 
responsible for helping countries 
implement the GHS, and has ongoing 
programs to prepare guidance 
documents, conduct regional 
workshops, and implement pilot 
projects in a number of nations. OSHA 
also continues to be involved in 
interagency discussions related to 
coordination of domestic 
implementation of the GHS, and in 
discussions related to international 
work to implement and maintain the 
GHS. 
IV. Overview and Purpose of the 
Proposed Modifications to the Hazard 
Communication Standard 
The intent of the HCS is to ensure that 
the hazards of all chemicals are 
evaluated, and that information 
concerning chemical hazards and 
associated protective measures is 
transmitted to employers and 
employees. The standard achieves this 
goal by requiring chemical 
manufacturers and importers to review 
available scientific evidence concerning 
the physical and health hazards of the 
chemicals they produce or import to 
determine if they are hazardous. For 
every chemical found to be hazardous, 
the chemical manufacturer or importer 
must develop a container label and an 
SDS and provide both documents to 
downstream users of the chemical. All 
employers with employees exposed to 
hazardous chemicals must develop a 
hazard communication program, and 
ensure that exposed employees are 
provided with labels, access to SDSs, 
and training on the hazardous chemicals 
in their workplace. 
The three information components in 
this system—labels, SDSs, and 
employee training—are all essential to 
the effective functioning of the program. 
Labels provide a brief, but immediate 
and conspicuous summary of hazard 
information at the site where the 
chemical is used. SDSs provide detailed 
technical information and serve as a 
reference source for exposed employees, 
industrial hygienists, safety 
professionals, emergency responders, 
health care professionals, and other 
interested parties. Training is designed 
to ensure that employees understand the 
chemical hazards in their workplace 
and are aware of protective measures to 
follow. Labels, SDSs, and training are 
complementary parts of a 
comprehensive hazard communication 
program—each element reinforces the 
knowledge necessary for effective 
protection of employees. 
Information required by the HCS 
reduces the incidence of chemical- 
related illnesses and injuries by 
enabling employers and employees to 
implement protective measures in the 
workplace. Employers can select less 
hazardous chemical alternatives and 
ensure that appropriate engineering 
controls, work practices, and personal 
protective equipment are in place. 
Improved understanding of chemical 
hazards by supervisory personnel 
results in safer handling of hazardous 
substances, as well as proper storage 
and housekeeping measures. 
Employees provided with information 
and training on chemical hazards are 
able to fully participate in the protective 
measures instituted in their workplaces. 
Knowledgeable employees can take the 
steps required to work safely with 
chemicals, and are able to determine 
what actions are necessary if an 
emergency occurs. Information on 
chronic effects of exposure to hazardous 
chemicals helps employees recognize 
signs and symptoms of chronic disease 
and seek early treatment. Information 
provided under the HCS also enables 
health and safety professionals to 
provide better services to exposed 
employees. Medical surveillance, 
exposure monitoring, and other services 
are enhanced by the ready availability of 
health and safety information. 
OSHA believes that the 
comprehensive approach adopted in the 
HCS—requiring evaluation of chemicals 
and the transmittal of information 
through labels, SDSs, and training—is 
sound. The proposed modifications to 
the rule do not alter that approach. 
Rather, the proposed modifications to 
the rule are intended to improve the 
effectiveness of the HCS by enhancing 
the quality and consistency of the 
information provided to employers and 
employees. OSHA believes this can be 
accomplished by modifying the 
requirements of the standard to conform 
with the more specific and detailed 
provisions of the GHS for classification,

labeling, and SDSs. OSHA’s rationale 
for this belief is summarized below. The 
evidence supporting this preliminary 
conclusion is presented in Section V of 
this preamble, and the proposed 
revisions to the HCS are discussed in 
detail in Section XV. 
HCS Provisions for Classification, 
Labeling, and SDSs 
The HCS covers a broad range of 
health and physical hazards. The 
standard is performance-oriented, 
providing definitions of hazards and 
parameters for evaluating the evidence 
to determine whether a chemical is 
considered hazardous. The evaluation is 
based upon evidence that is currently 
available, and no testing of chemicals is 
required. 
The standard covers every type of 
health effect that may occur, including 
both acute and chronic effects. 
Definitions of a number of adverse 
health effects are provided in the 
standard. These definitions are 
indicative of the wide range of coverage, 
but are not exclusive. Any adverse 
health effect that is substantiated by a 
study conducted according to 
established scientific principles, and 
reporting a statistically significant 
outcome, is sufficient for determining 
that a chemical is hazardous under the 
rule. 
Most chemicals in commerce are not 
present in the pure state (i.e., as 
individual elements or compounds), but 
are provided as mixtures of chemicals. 
Evaluation of the health hazards of 
mixtures is based on data for the 
mixture as a whole when such data are 
available. When data on the mixture as 
a whole are not available, the mixture is 
considered to present the same health 
hazards as any ingredients present at a 
concentration of 1% or greater, or, in the 
case of carcinogens, concentrations of 
0.1% or greater. The HCS also 
recognizes that risk may remain at 
concentrations below these cut-offs, and 
where there is evidence that is the case, 
the mixtures are considered hazardous 
under the standard. 
The current definitions of physical 
hazards in the HCS were derived from 
other OSHA standards that address such 
chemicals (e.g., flammable chemicals), 
or from the DOT criteria for physical 
hazards at the time OSHA promulgated 
the HCS. DOT subsequently changed 
their criteria to be consistent with the 
internationally harmonized transport 
requirements, and the HCS criteria for 
classification of physical hazards are 
generally not consistent with current 
DOT requirements. 
The HCS establishes requirements for 
minimum information that must be 
included on labels and SDSs, but does 
not provide specific language to convey 
the information or a format in which to 
provide it. When the HCS was issued in 
1983, the public record strongly 
supported this performance-oriented 
approach (see 48 FR 53300–53310). 
Many chemical manufacturers and 
importers were already providing 
information voluntarily, and in the 
absence of specific requirements had 
developed their own formats and 
approaches. The record indicated that a 
performance-oriented approach would 
reduce the need for chemical 
manufacturers and importers to revise 
these existing documents to comply 
with the HCS, thus reducing the cost 
impact of the standard. In recognition of 
the work that had been voluntarily 
completed, OSHA decided to allow 
labels and SDSs to be presented in any 
format desired, as long as the minimum 
information requirements of the 
standard were met. 
GHS Provisions for Classification, 
Labeling, and SDSs 
The GHS is an internationally 
harmonized system for classifying 
chemical hazards and developing labels 
and safety data sheets. However, the 
GHS is not a model standard that can be 
adopted verbatim. Rather, it is a set of 
criteria and provisions that regulatory 
authorities can incorporate into existing 
systems, or use to develop a new 
system. 
The GHS is designed to allow 
regulatory authorities to choose 
provisions that are appropriate to their 
particular sphere of regulation. This is 
referred to as the ‘‘building block 
approach.’’ The GHS includes all of the 
regulatory components, or building 
blocks, that might be needed for 
classification and labeling requirements 
for chemicals in the workplace, 
transport, pesticides, and consumer 
products. 
Regulatory authorities such as OSHA 
adopt the provisions of the GHS that are 
appropriate for their particular 
regulatory sector, but do not need to 
adopt all of the criteria and provisions 
of the GHS. For example, the GHS 
includes criteria for classifying 
chemicals for aquatic toxicity. Since 
OSHA does not have the regulatory 
authority to address environmental 
concerns, OSHA would not adopt the 
GHS criteria for aquatic toxicity. The 
building block approach may also be 
applied to the criteria for defining 
hazards. For example, the acute toxicity 
criteria in the GHS are much broader 
than those currently found in the HCS. 
This is to allow consumer product 
authorities the ability to address the 
protection of children and other 
vulnerable populations. OSHA would 
not need to adopt all of the acute 
toxicity categories to maintain 
protection of employees in the 
workplace. 
The building block approach can also 
be applied when a regulatory authority 
decides which parts of the system to 
adopt. For example, the GHS includes 
classification criteria and provisions for 
labels and SDSs. While OSHA is 
proposing to adopt all of these elements 
because the current HCS cover labels 
and SDSs, consumer product and 
transportation authorities are not 
expected to require SDSs. 
Under the GHS, each hazard or 
endpoint (e.g., Explosives, 
Carcinogenicity) is considered to be a 
hazard class. The classes are generally 
sub-divided into categories of hazard. 
The definitions of hazards are more 
specific and detailed than those 
currently in the HCS. For example, 
under the HCS, a chemical is either an 
explosive or it is not. Under the GHS, 
there are seven categories of explosives, 
and assignment to these categories is 
based on the classification criteria 
provided. 
The GHS generally applies a tiered 
approach to evaluation of mixtures. The 
first step is consideration of data on the 
mixture as a whole. The second step 
allows the use of ‘‘bridging principles’’ 
to estimate the hazards of the mixture 
based on information about its 
components. The third step of the tiered 
approach involves use of cut-off values 
based on the composition of the 
mixture, or for acute toxicity, a formula 
which is used for classification. The 
approach is generally consistent with 
the current requirements of the HCS, but 
provides more detail and specification 
and allows for extrapolation of data 
available on the components of a 
mixture to a greater extent—particularly 
for acute effects. 
Hazard communication requirements 
under the GHS are directly linked to the 
hazard classification. For each class and 
category of hazard, a harmonized signal 
word (e.g., Danger), pictogram (e.g., 
skull and crossbones), and hazard 
statement (e.g., Fatal if Swallowed) are 
specified. These specified elements are 
referred to as the core information for a 
chemical. Thus, once a chemical is 
classified, the GHS provides the specific 
core information to convey to users of 
that chemical. The core information 
allocated to each category generally 
reflects the degree of severity of the 
hazard. Precautionary statements are 
also required on GHS labels. The GHS 
provides example precautionary 
statements, but they are not yet

considered formally harmonized. In 
other words, it would be possible for 
regulatory authorities to use different 
language for the precautionary 
statements. However, it appears likely 
that the language in the examples will 
become the harmonized text of the GHS 
on precautionary statements in the near 
future. The most recent revision to the 
GHS has codified these statements (i.e., 
assigned numbers to them) as well as 
aligned them with the hazard classes 
and categories. Codification allows 
reference to them in a shorthand form, 
and makes it easier for authorities using 
them in regulatory text to organize 
them. In addition, there are provisions 
to allow supplementary information so 
that chemical manufacturers can 
provide data in addition to the specified 
core information. 
The GHS establishes a standardized 
16-section format for SDSs to provide a 
consistent sequence for presentation of 
information to SDS users. Items of 
primary interest to exposed employees 
and emergency responders are 
presented at the beginning of the 
document, while more technical 
information is presented later. Headings 
for the sections (e.g., First Aid 
Measures, Handling and Storage) are 
standardized to facilitate locating 
information of interest. The harmonized 
data sheets are consistent with the order 
of information included in the voluntary 
industry consensus standard for safety 
data sheets (ANSI Z400.1). 
Advantages of the Proposed 
Modifications to the Standard 
OSHA believes that the detailed and 
specific classification requirements of 
the GHS would result in better, more 
consistent information being provided 
to employers and employees. 
Classification under the revised criteria 
would not only indicate the type of 
hazard, but would generally give an 
indication of the degree of severity of 
the hazard as well. This information 
would be helpful to both employers and 
employees in understanding chemical 
hazards and identifying and 
implementing protective measures. The 
detailed criteria for classification are 
also expected to result in greater 
accuracy in hazard classification and 
more consistency among classifiers. By 
following the detailed criteria, 
classifiers are less likely to reach 
different interpretations of the same 
data. 
OSHA also believes that standardized 
presentation of information on labels 
and safety data sheets would improve 
the comprehensibility of chemical 
hazard information. Employers and 
employees would be given the same 
core information on a chemical 
regardless of the supplier. Use of 
standardized pictograms would 
complement and reinforce the 
information provided through signal 
words and hazard statements. 
Pictograms are also anticipated to 
improve communication for those who 
are not functionally literate, or who are 
not literate in the language used on the 
label. The standardized format for SDSs 
is expected to make the information 
easier for users to find, with the 
information employees and emergency 
responders need most appearing in the 
beginning of the document for easy 
identification and reference. 
Standardized requirements for labels 
and SDSs are also expected to increase 
the accuracy of chemical hazard 
information. With consistent 
presentation of information, the task of 
reviewing SDSs and labels to assure 
accuracy would be simplified. 
Individuals preparing and reviewing 
these documents should find it easier to 
identify any missing elements, and 
OSHA enforcement personnel should be 
able to more efficiently examine SDSs 
and labels when conducting 
inspections. 
Another advantage that will result 
from adopting a system that has 
harmonized hazard statements in it 
relates to the use of ‘‘control banding,’’ 
a guidance approach to recommending 
control measures for chemical 
exposures. The approach uses 
information that is readily available to 
small and medium-sized employers 
with chemicals in their workplaces to 
provide them with workplace-specific 
control recommendations. Basically, the 
system uses such information to 
estimate the degree of severity of the 
hazard and the amount of chemical 
present, and relates that to the degree of 
control needed. The control banding 
approach relies on harmonized hazard 
statements to allow the system to 
estimate the degree of severity of the 
hazard. Initially based on the European 
hazard classification system, it has now 
been converted to the GHS phrases. The 
use of control banding to provide 
guidance for chemical safety and health 
approaches in U.S. workplaces cannot 
be accomplished until harmonized 
hazard statements are readily available. 
Adoption of the GHS and its phrases 
would open up the possibility that 
control banding guidance can be used in 
the U.S. to help small and medium- 
sized employers select and implement 
appropriate control measures. For more 
information on control banding, please 
see http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ 
ctrlbanding/. 
OSHA is proposing modifications to 
the HCS that are necessary for 
consistency with the GHS. The GHS 
does not include requirements for a 
written hazard communication program 
or for employee training. OSHA is not 
proposing any substantive changes to 
the requirements for a written hazard 
communication program. However, 
OSHA believes that additional training 
would be necessary to ensure that 
employees understand some elements of 
the new system. In particular, some 
training and familiarization would be 
needed for pictograms to be effective. 
The Agency is therefore proposing 
modified training requirements to 
address the new label elements and SDS 
format that would be required under the 
revised standard. 
The GHS leaves certain matters to the 
competent authority (i.e., the regulatory 
authority with jurisdiction over that 
sector) to determine. OSHA would 
maintain its current approaches in these 
situations. For example, the scope and 
application provisions in the HCS 
address the interface of the OSHA 
requirements with requirements of other 
agencies. These scope provisions would 
remain unchanged under the proposed 
rule. 
The proposed modifications to the 
HCS primarily affect manufacturers and 
importers of hazardous chemicals. 
Chemical manufacturers and importers 
would be required to re-evaluate 
chemicals according to the new criteria 
in order to ensure they are classified 
appropriately. For health hazards, this 
will necessitate placing the chemical in 
the appropriate hazard category as well 
as the hazard class. For physical 
hazards, however, the new criteria are 
generally consistent with current DOT 
requirements for transport. Therefore, if 
the chemicals are transported (i.e., they 
are not produced and used in the same 
workplace), this classification should 
already be done for physical hazards for 
purposes of complying with DOT’s 
transport requirements. This should 
minimize the additional work required 
for classification of physical hazards. 
Preparation and distribution of modified 
labels and safety data sheets by 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
would also be required. Those chemical 
manufacturers and importers already 
following the ANSI Z400.1 standard for 
safety data sheets should already have 
the appropriate format, and would only 
be required to make some small 
modifications to the content of the 
sheets to be in compliance. 
Compliance requirements for 
chemical users would be limited. 
Workplaces where chemicals are used 
would need to integrate the new

approach into their hazard 
communication program, assuring that 
employees understand the pictograms 
and other information provided on 
labels and SDSs. Employers who use 
chemicals, and exposed employees, 
would benefit from receiving labels and 
safety data sheets presented in a 
consistent format. The information 
should be easier to find and 
comprehend, allowing it to be used 
more effectively for the protection of 
employees. 
Changing the HCS to make it conform 
to the GHS will also make it necessary 
to modify a number of other OSHA 
standards. Modifications are proposed 
to the standards for Flammable and 
Combustible Liquids in general industry 
(29 CFR 1910.106) and construction (29 
CFR 1926.152) to align the requirements 
of the standards with the GHS hazard 
categories for flammable liquids. A 
modification to the Process Safety 
Management standard (29 CFR 
1910.119) is proposed to ensure that the 
scope of the standard is not changed by 
the proposed modifications to the HCS. 
In addition, modifications to most of 
OSHA’s substance-specific health 
standards are proposed to ensure that 
requirements for signs and labels are 
consistent with the modified HCS. 
OSHA’s preliminary determination to 
modify the HCS is based on its 
assessment of the potential to improve 
employee safety and health by adopting 
the GHS approach to hazard 
communication. However, GHS 
implementation is also expected to 
accomplish a number of other 
objectives, and produce additional 
benefits. By providing an internationally 
comprehensible system for hazard 
communication, the GHS is anticipated 
to enhance the protection of the 
environment and of human health in all 
sectors, not only the workplace. The 
GHS provides a framework for 
developing a hazard communication 
system for those countries without an 
existing system, thus protecting 
employees around the world and 
helping to ensure that the appropriate 
information is received with chemicals 
imported into American workplaces. 
Implementation of the GHS is also 
expected to reduce the need for testing 
and evaluation of chemicals, since 
classification would be based on 
existing data and would only need to be 
performed once for each substance. In 
addition, implementation of the GHS is 
expected to facilitate international trade 
in chemicals, as the need to identify and 
comply with diverse and complex 
hazard communication requirements in 
different countries would be reduced or 
eliminated. 
Alternative Approaches 
In this section OSHA presents several 
alternatives to the proposed GHS 
modification to the HCS to respond to 
concerns raised by commenters through 
the ANPR. OSHA provides the 
following discussion of these 
alternatives and their potential impacts 
and requests comments regarding their 
relative costs, benefits, feasibility, 
impact on small businesses, impact on 
worker safety and health, and any other 
issues on which commenters may wish 
to provide feedback. 
This rulemaking seeks to improve 
employee protections by adopting an 
internationally harmonized approach to 
hazard communication issues. While 
the current HCS provides protections for 
exposed workers by disseminating 
information about chemicals in their 
workplaces, OSHA believes, as 
discussed in Section V, that the 
adoption of GHS strengthens and refines 
the system, and gives OSHA the 
opportunity to improve worker safety by 
improving hazard communications. The 
GHS has the same general concept of an 
integrated, comprehensive process of 
identifying and communicating hazards, 
but provides more extensive criteria to 
define the hazards in a consistent 
manner, as well as standardizes label 
elements and SDS formats to help to 
ensure that the information is conveyed 
consistently. 
Additionally, the Agency believes that 
adoption of the GHS as proposed will 
simplify implementation insofar as 
OSHA’s preferred alternative would 
clearly be considered ‘‘harmonized’’ 
with other regulatory authorities in the 
world, and thereby acquire the full 
benefits of harmonization. 
This is in line with the GHS, which 
anticipates that countries will adopt the 
hazard classification criteria and 
required label elements, as well as SDS 
requirements in workplaces. As stated 
in the introduction to the GHS (3rd 
revision): 
1.1.3.1.3 In the workplace, it is expected 
that all of the GHS elements will be adopted, 
including labels that have the harmonized 
core information under the GHS, and safety 
data sheets. It is also anticipated that this 
will be supplemented by employee training 
to help ensure effective communication. 
As addressed in Section XV, many 
commenters supported the concept of 
OSHA moving forward to adopt the 
GHS (Document ID #s 0003, 0007, 0047, 
0050, 0052, 0062, 0106, 0011, 0033, 
0038, 0123, 0130, 0151, 0163, and 
0171). While others objected to 
adoption, OSHA has identified and 
responded to their concerns in Section 
XV as well. In addition, there were 
several commenters who noted that 
small chemical manufacturers that are 
not in international trade of chemicals 
would have a large burden associated 
with adopting the GHS, and 
questionable benefits due to their lack of 
international trade. (Document ID # 
0022). Others simply noted that they 
believed there would be high costs and 
limited benefits for such employers, or 
that it would be costly and difficult to 
adopt (Document ID #s 0015, 0026, 
0178, and 0144). There was no 
discussion in any of these comments 
about potential alternatives. 
It should be noted that it appears that 
all of these commenters assumed the 
primary benefits of adopting the GHS 
would be in facilitating international 
trade. As has been addressed in Section 
VII, OSHA has based the benefits of this 
action on improved communication to 
workers and has provided initial 
estimates of a range of benefits that 
would be achieved in this area; trade 
benefits which, while recognized, have 
not been quantified. Therefore, 
grandfathering or other exemptions 
related to this rule might result in 
workers in those facilities receiving 
lower benefits of increased 
comprehensibility relative to workers in 
other types and sizes of workplaces; 
OSHA considers this a serious concern 
that could potentially exclude a group 
of workers exposed to hazardous 
chemicals from the increased benefits 
associated with clearer and more 
specific classification criteria, as well as 
standardized label elements. 
Alternatives: 
In order to respond to the concerns 
raised in these comments, OSHA 
solicits comment on several options: 
1. The first option is designed to 
facilitate voluntary adoption of GHS 
within the existing HCS framework. 
Specifically, this approach would 
involve recognition and adoption of the 
GHS, with minimal changes to the 
current HCS. Under this approach, 
entities could opt to adopt GHS or 
continue to follow their current practice 
under HCS. 
Therefore, companies would decide 
whether they would continue 
complying with the existing standard, or 
comply with the GHS. This would 
reduce the costs for those companies 
that choose to remain in compliance 
with the existing HCS, and allow those 
companies that foresee the benefits of 
GHS compliance from a trade 
perspective to adopt its provisions. 
Another version of this option would be 
to exempt small chemical producers 
from complying. 
2. A second option that OSHA is 
seeking to solicit comment on would

50290 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
make modifications to the current HCS 
in order to improve hazard 
communication through adoption of 
components of the GHS. Under this 
option OSHA would add requirements 
for standardized hazard statements, 
signal words, and precautionary 
statements being added to the current 
HCS, but otherwise would follow the 
approach outlined in Alternative 1 
above. 
Since the standardized labels are 
relatively inexpensive to implement, 
while reviewing classifications is more 
costly, this has the potential to reduce 
the overall cost of implementation of the 
revised rule. 
A variation on this alternative would 
entail incorporation of some, but not all, 
of the label elements. In particular, the 
Agency would not adopt the 
precautionary statements since these are 
not yet considered to be ‘‘harmonized’’ 
under the GHS—they are provided for 
guidance and reference, but competent 
authorities may choose to implement 
other statements. The precautionary 
statements could be adopted later when 
they are harmonized under the GHS. Or, 
alternatively, OSHA could either allow 
label preparers to use whatever 
precautionary statements they deem 
appropriate or develop its own set of 
statements to require. 
From OSHA’s perspective, a key issue 
regarding the alternative approaches 
presented is that the classification 
criteria in the GHS are different from the 
hazard definitions in the current HCS. 
In general, as discussed in Section XV, 
they cover the same scope of hazard so 
these differences do not result in 
significant differences in the chemicals 
covered. But the GHS criteria divide 
most of the hazard classes into hazard 
categories that convey the severity of the 
effect, while few of the hazard classes in 
the current HCS take this approach. The 
standardized label elements are 
associated with these specific hazard 
categories, i.e., the harmonized 
pictograms, signal words, and hazard 
statements are assigned by hazard 
category and reflect the degree of hazard 
it presents to those exposed. Likewise, 
the precautionary statements assigned 
are also reflective of the degree of 
hazard, with responses related to these 
presumed hazard levels. 
Additionally, with regard to the first 
alternative, there will be chemicals that 
will be classified in different hazards 
classes under the GHS classification 
scheme versus the HCS hazard 
determination step. In addition, these 
chemicals will also be assigned to 
hazard categories under GHS where 
there are none now. This is particularly 
true for the classification of mixtures for 
all hazards, except the chronic health 
hazards, since the hazard determination 
scheme in the current HCS is based 
solely on concentration limits and the 
GHS classification scheme is based on 
bridging principles. Under the 
alternatives presented workers might be 
given different hazard information when 
exposed to a chemical purchased from 
two different suppliers. OSHA notes 
that this would be similar to the 
situation under the current 
performance-oriented HCS, but this 
approach may forego an opportunity to 
make the system more consistent. 
OSHA is interested in comments 
related to the alternatives addressing the 
extent to which differences in 
classification between the GHS and HCS 
might create confusion or otherwise 
result in problems. OSHA is further 
interested in comments addressing the 
classification of mixtures under the 
alternatives discussed, given the 
differences in classification under HCS 
and GHS applicable to mixtures. 
Given the current variability in MSDS 
and labels under the performance based 
HCS, OSHA believes that this approach 
might not have a negative impact on 
safety and health relative to our current 
HCS. However, the Agency anticipates 
that components of the GHS would 
confer benefits external to producers 
(e.g., the benefits associated with clearer 
and more specific classification criteria, 
as well as labels or other changes that 
could potentially make easier for users 
to locate and understand the 
information they are seeking), adoption 
of this alternative could result in 
foregone benefits. In addition, a small 
number of chemicals or mixtures might 
be labeled differently due to differing 
categorization results between the 
existing HCS and GHS. 
OSHA is generally seeking comment 
on the possible cost impacts associated 
with the alternatives on the chain of 
chemical suppliers. OSHA notes that 
large and small producers are not 
mutually exclusive so that a large 
business or distributers engaged in 
international trade cannot simply and 
straightforwardly choose to implement 
the GHS regardless of their suppliers. 
Small businesses sell to large 
businesses. If small businesses do not 
adopt the GHS, then the large 
businesses or the distributor would 
either have to generate GHS 
classifications for chemicals they buy 
from them or request that small 
businesses supply data and labels using 
GHS classifications. Likewise, chemical 
producers often provide their products 
to distributors who then sell them to 
customers unknown to the original 
producer. Thus knowing whether or not 
a product will wind up in international 
trade may be questionable in some 
situations. A producer may provide a 
substance to another company, who 
then formulates it into a product that is 
sold internationally—thus the original 
producer is involved in international 
trade without necessarily realizing it. In 
theses cases, costs would be incurred for 
the conversion to GHS. This issue was 
raised in comments regarding the 
effective dates for the rule, when many 
suggested it was not appropriate to 
differentiate dates based on the size of 
the business. For example, ORC 
Worldwide, Inc. stated (Document ID # 
0123): 
OSHA should consider a company’s place 
in the manufacturing supply chain, not size, 
in determining how the phase-in is 
implemented. It would be sensible to start 
with producers of raw materials and basic 
chemicals. The technical information, 
classification and categorization they perform 
will be useful downstream for the 
intermediate chemical producers and 
specialty chemical manufacturers. Lastly, the 
end user will benefit from the influx of 
information developed by the upstream 
professionals. 
OSHA solicits comment on whether a 
voluntary system, or a system based on 
business size, could be successfully 
implemented given the structure of the 
supply system. 
OSHA seeks comment on how 
companies that use chemicals, but don’t 
produce them, would be affected under 
an alternative approach. Rather than 
potentially simplifying compliance and 
improving comprehensibility, the user 
of chemicals would continue to see 
variation in labels on purchased 
chemicals. This would be further 
complicated by the fact that the 
underlying criteria for these labels may 
be different as well, and thus the 
warnings would be too. If there is no 
requirement for such employers to be 
familiar with the new system, and train 
their employees, then there will be new 
pictograms and signal words with no 
structure for ensuring they are 
understood and the appropriate 
precautions are implemented. 
Regarding Alternative 2, under 
OSHA’s proposed approach the label 
provisions are relatively cost-efficient to 
adopt given that the GHS assigns the 
various required elements by hazard 
class and category and once the 
classification or re-classification has 
been accomplished, the GHS provides 
the specific information for the label. 
OSHA solicits comment on whether 
requiring this standardized approach to 
labeling under the HCS, without the 
infrastructure of the GHS will be 
burdensome for the chemical

manufacturer to accomplish OSHA 
further solicits comment on whether 
confusion may result from labels that 
may look the same but which actually 
reflect different classification criteria. 
Under this approach, chemical 
producers will have to assess their 
current determinations and attempt to 
relate them to the established hazard 
classes and categories. Alternatively, 
OSHA could create a regulatory system 
assigning HCS categories to each GHS 
label elements; comments are welcomed 
on the impact on benefits and costs, and 
the feasibility of such an approach. 
OSHA believes it is unlikely that this 
component of Alternative 2 would 
provide significant savings over 
reviewing classifications for purposes of 
putting the chemicals into GHS classes 
and categories. 
OSHA is concerned that chemical 
producers following this approach 
might not be able to use their labels in 
other countries where the GHS has been 
adopted. OSHA is further concerned 
that adopting only some elements of the 
GHS label may be confusing and may 
fail to provide useful information 
regarding the possible hazardous effects 
of exposure. Delaying adoption of the 
precautionary statements may also 
reduce the effectiveness of the labels 
significantly, and reduce the 
appropriate information on the SDSs as 
well. A variation on this alternative—to 
simply require precautionary 
statements, but not to specify what they 
are, may generate significant variation 
due to the performance-oriented 
approach that allows the label preparer 
to determine what they are or if they are 
included. One communication 
advantage of providing the information 
in the same language from label-to-label 
is that workers and other users can be 
assured that the same action is required. 
If you take a simple preventive measure 
such as ‘‘wash your hands,’’ but convey 
it in several different ways, the reader 
of the label will think you mean 
something different. This is one of the 
advantages of providing the text for 
these statements in the revised HCS. In 
addition, since these precautionary 
statements will be translated, this 
should make it easier for those 
participating in international trade to 
produce and use labels. 
Thus, OSHA solicits comment on a 
range of alternative approaches to 
regulatory adoption of GHS and 
welcomes comments on these options. 
The costs and benefits are further 
addressed in Section VII. 
V. Need and Support for the Proposed 
Modifications to the Hazard 
Communication Standard 
Chemical exposure can cause or 
contribute to many serious adverse 
health effects such as cancer, sterility, 
heart disease, lung damage, and burns. 
Some chemicals are also physical 
hazards and have the potential to cause 
fires, explosions, and other dangerous 
incidents. It is critically important that 
employees and employers are apprised 
of the hazards of chemicals that are used 
in the workplace, as well as associated 
protective measures. This knowledge is 
needed to understand the precautions 
necessary for safe handling and use, to 
recognize signs and symptoms of 
adverse health effects related to 
exposure when they do occur, and to 
identify appropriate measures to be 
taken in an emergency. 
OSHA established the need for 
disclosure of chemical hazard 
information when the HCS was issued 
in 1983 (48 FR 53282–53284). This need 
continues to exist. The Agency 
estimates that 880,000 hazardous 
chemicals are currently used in the U.S., 
and over 40 million employees are now 
potentially exposed to hazardous 
chemicals in over 5 million workplaces. 
Chemical exposures result in a 
substantial number of serious injuries 
and illnesses among exposed 
employees. The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics estimates that employees 
suffered 55,400 illnesses that could be 
attributed to chemical exposures in 
2007, the latest year for which data are 
available (BLS, 2008). In that same year, 
17,340 chemical-source injuries and 
illnesses involved days away from work 
(BLS, 2009). 
The BLS data, however, do not 
indicate the full extent of the problem, 
particularly with regard to illnesses. As 
noted in the preamble to the HCS in 
1983, BLS figures probably only reflect 
a small percentage of the incidents 
occurring in exposed employees (48 FR 
53284). Many occupational illnesses are 
not reported because they are not 
recognized as being related to workplace 
exposures, are subject to long latency 
periods between exposure and the 
manifestation of disease, and other 
factors (e.g., Herbert and Landrigan, 
2000; Leigh et al., 1997; Landrigan and 
Markowitz, 1989). 
The HCS currently serves to ensure 
that information concerning chemical 
hazards and associated protective 
measures is provided to employers and 
employees. However, OSHA’s 
experience, along with information 
acquired since the HCS was issued, 
indicates that modifications to the 
standard may be appropriate. The 
Agency believes that the proposed 
changes, based on the GHS, will 
substantially improve the quality and 
consistency of the information provided 
to employers and employees. OSHA 
further believes the proposed revisions 
to the HCS will enhance workplace 
protections, because better information 
will enable employers and employees to 
take measures that would result in a 
reduction in the number and severity of 
chemical-related injuries and illnesses. 
A key foundation underlying this 
belief relates to the comprehensibility of 
information conveyed under the GHS. 
All hazard communication systems deal 
with complicated scientific information 
being transmitted to largely non- 
technical audiences. During the 
development of the GHS, in order to 
construct the most effective hazard 
communication system, information 
about and experiences with existing 
systems were sought to help ensure that 
the best approaches would be used. 
Ensuring the comprehensibility of the 
GHS was a key issue during its 
development. As noted in a Federal 
Register notice published by the U.S. 
Department of State (62 FR 15956, April 
3, 1997): ‘‘A major concern is to ensure 
that the requirements of the globally 
harmonized system address issues 
related to the comprehensibility of the 
information conveyed.’’ This concern is 
also reflected in the principles of 
harmonization that were used to guide 
the negotiations and discussions during 
the development of the GHS. As 
described in Section 1.1.1.6(g) of the 
GHS, the principles included the 
following: ‘‘[T]he comprehension of 
chemical hazard information, by the 
target audience, e.g., workers, 
consumers and the general public 
should be addressed.’’ 
To help in the development of the 
GHS, OSHA had a review of the 
literature conducted to identify studies 
on effective hazard communication, and 
made the review and the analysis of the 
studies available to other participants in 
the GHS process. Prepared by 
researchers at the University of 
Maryland, the document entitled 
‘‘Hazard Communication: A Review of 
the Science Underpinning the Art of 
Communication for Health and Safety’’ 
(Sattler et al., 1997) has also long been 
available to the public on OSHA’s 
Hazard Communication web page. More 
recently, OSHA conducted an updated 
review of the literature published since 
the 1997 review. This updated review 
examined the literature relevant to 
specific hazard communication 
provisions of the GHS (ERG, 2007).

Further work related to 
comprehensibility was conducted 
during the GHS negotiations by 
researchers in South Africa at the 
University of Cape Town—the result is 
an annex to the GHS related to 
comprehensibility testing (see GHS 
Annex 6, Comprehensibility Testing 
Methodology) (United Nations, 2009). 
Such testing has been conducted in 
some of the developing countries 
preparing to implement the GHS, and 
has provided these countries with 
information about which areas in the 
GHS will require more training in their 
programs to ensure people understand 
the information. The primary purpose of 
these activities was to ensure that the 
system developed was designed in such 
a way that the messages would be 
effectively conveyed to the target 
audiences, with the knowledge that the 
system would be implemented 
internationally in different cultures with 
varying interests and concerns. 
Also among the agreed principles that 
were established to guide development 
of the GHS was that the level of 
protection offered by an existing hazard 
communication system should not be 
reduced. Following these principles, the 
best aspects of existing systems were 
identified and included in a single, 
harmonized approach to classification, 
labeling, and development of SDSs. 
The GHS was developed by a large 
group of experts representing a variety 
of perspectives. Over 200 experts 
provided technical input on the project. 
The United Nations Sub-Committee of 
Experts on the GHS, the body that 
formally adopted the GHS and is now 
responsible for its maintenance, 
includes 32 member nations as well as 
17 observer nations. Authorities from 
these member states are able to convey 
the insight and understanding acquired 
by regulatory authorities in different 
sectors, and to relate their own 
experiences in implementation of 
hazard communication requirements. In 
addition, over two dozen international 
and intergovernmental organizations, 
trade associations, and unions are 
represented, and their expertise serves 
to inform the member nations. The GHS 
consequently represents a consensus 
recommendation of experts with regard 
to best practices for effective chemical 
hazard communication, reflecting the 
collective knowledge and experience of 
regulatory authorities in many nations 
and in different regulatory sectors, as 
well as other organizations that have 
expertise in this area. A number of 
United States-based scientific and 
professional associations have endorsed 
adoption of the GHS. The American 
Chemical Society indicated its support 
for the GHS, stating: ‘‘The American 
Chemical Society (ACS) strongly 
supports the adoption of the GHS for 
hazard communication in general and 
specifically as outlined in the ANPR’’ 
adding that ‘‘* * * ACS anticipates that 
OSHA implementation of GHS in the 
U.S. will enhance protection of human 
health and the environment through 
warnings and precautionary language 
that are consistent across different 
products and materials as well as across 
all workplaces’’ (Document ID #0165). 
In comments submitted in response to 
the ANPR, the American Industrial 
Hygiene Association (AIHA) affirmed its 
support for modification of the HCS to 
adopt the GHS. AIHA maintained that 
standardized labels and safety data 
sheets will make hazard information 
easier to use, thereby improving 
protection of employees (Document ID 
#0034). The American Society of Safety 
Engineers also indicated its support for 
the GHS rulemaking (Document ID 
#0139). While acknowledging that the 
GHS presents a number of concerns and 
challenges, the Society of Toxicology 
has also expressed its support for the 
GHS, stating that ‘‘a globally 
harmonized system for the classification 
of chemicals is an important step 
toward creating consistent 
communications about the hazards of 
chemicals used around the world’’ 
(SOT, 2007). The American Association 
of Occupational Health Nurses joined 
these organizations in advocating 
adoption of the GHS, arguing that 
standardization of chemical hazard 
information is critical to protecting the 
safety and health of employees 
(Document ID #0099). The positions 
taken by these organizations point to 
wide support for the GHS among the 
scientific and professional communities. 
In addition to the endorsement of the 
GHS by a group of experts with 
extensive knowledge and experience in 
chemical hazard communication and 
support from scientific and professional 
associations with expertise in this area, 
a substantial body of evidence indicates 
that the proposed modifications to the 
HCS will better protect employees. 
Specifically, this evidence supports 
OSHA’s belief that: (1) Standardized 
label elements—signal words, 
pictograms, hazard statements and 
precautionary statements—would be 
more effective in communicating hazard 
information; (2) standardized headings 
and a consistent order of information 
would improve the utility of SDSs; and 
(3) training would support and enhance 
the effectiveness of the new label and 
SDS requirements. 
This evidence was obtained from a 
number of sources. OSHA has 
commissioned several studies to 
examine the quality of information on 
SDSs (Karstadt, 1988; Kearney/Centaur 
1991a, 1991b; Lexington Group, 1999); 
the General Accounting Office (GAO) 
has issued two reports based on its 
evaluation of certain aspects of the HCS 
(GAO 1991, 1992); a National Advisory 
Committee on Occupational Safety and 
Health (NACOSH) workgroup 
conducted a review of hazard 
communication and published a report 
of its findings (NACOSH, 1996); and a 
substantial amount of scientific 
literature relating to hazard 
communication has been published. As 
mentioned previously, OSHA 
commissioned a review of the literature, 
and a report based on that review was 
published in 1997 (Sattler et al., 1997). 
An updated review was published in 
2007 (ERG, 2007). In addition, OSHA 
conducted a review of the requirements 
of the HCS and published its findings in 
March of 2004 (OSHA, 2004). Key 
findings derived from these sources are 
discussed below. 
OSHA’s rationale for adopting the 
GHS is tied to anticipated 
improvements in the quality and 
consistency of the information that 
would be provided to employers and 
employees. Hazard classification is the 
foundation for development of this 
improved information. Indeed, hazard 
classification is the procedure of 
identifying and evaluating available 
scientific evidence in order to determine 
if a chemical is hazardous, and the 
degree of hazard, pursuant to the criteria 
for health and physical hazards set forth 
in the standard. Hazard classification 
provides the basis for the hazard 
information that is provided in labels, 
SDSs, and employee training. As such, 
it is critically important that 
classification be performed accurately 
and consistently. 
The GHS provides detailed scientific 
criteria to direct the evaluation process. 
The specificity and detail provided help 
ensure that different evaluators would 
reach the same conclusions when 
evaluating the same chemical. 
Moreover, the GHS refines that 
classification process by establishing 
categories of hazard within most hazard 
classes. These categories indicate the 
relative degree of hazard, and thereby 
provide a basis for determining precise 
hazard information that is tailored to the 
level of hazard posed by the chemical. 
The classification criteria established in 
the GHS thus provide the necessary 
basis for development of the specific, 
detailed hazard information that would 
enhance the protection of employees.

Labels 
Labels provide a brief, conspicuous 
hazard summary at the work site where 
a chemical is used. Labels serve as an 
immediate visual reminder of chemical 
hazards, and complement the 
information presented in training and 
on SDSs. 
The HCS currently requires that labels 
on hazardous chemical containers 
include the identity of the hazardous 
chemical; appropriate hazard warnings 
that convey the specific physical and 
health hazards, including target organ 
effects; and the name and address of the 
chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
other responsible party. The HCS does 
not specify a standard format or design 
elements for labels. 
OSHA is proposing a requirement that 
labels include four new, standardized 
elements: a signal word; hazard 
statement(s); pictogram(s); and 
precautionary statement(s) (see Section 
XV for a detailed discussion of the 
proposed requirements). The 
appropriate label elements for a 
chemical would be determined by the 
hazard classification. OSHA believes 
that these standardized label elements 
would better convey critically important 
hazard warnings, and provide useful 
information regarding precautionary 
measures that would serve to better 
protect employees. 
A great deal of literature has been 
developed that examines the 
effectiveness of warnings on labels. 
However, some important limitations 
must be recognized in applying this 
information to workplace labels for 
hazardous chemical products. Most 
studies have examined labels for 
prescription and non-prescription 
medications, alcoholic beverages, or 
consumer products. Relatively few 
studies pertain specifically to labels for 
hazardous chemicals in the workplace. 
Much of the literature is also 
characterized by the use of research 
subjects such as college students or 
consumers. Such subjects may not be 
representative of workplace 
populations, as these subjects may differ 
from typical employees in terms of 
product knowledge, hazard perception, 
perceptual abilities, and safety 
motivation. In addition, some studies 
involve non-U.S. populations that may 
not be representative of the U.S. 
workforce. 
Nevertheless, the literature provides a 
substantial body of information 
applicable to workplace chemical labels. 
In spite of the differences in affected 
populations, workplace chemical labels 
have many characteristics that are 
comparable to those found in other 
sectors. Pharmaceutical labels, for 
example, are similar to chemical labels 
in that they often have explicit 
instructions for use which, if not 
followed, can cause adverse health 
effects or death. Designers of 
pharmaceutical labels also encounter 
many of the same challenges faced by 
those who design chemical labels, such 
as container space limitations and the 
need to convey information to low- 
literate or non-English literate users. In 
addition, some of the research is not 
directly related to any particular sector 
or type of product. Some findings 
related to use of color, for example, 
could reasonably be applied to a wide 
variety of label applications. Relevant 
finding from the literature are presented 
in the sections that follow. 
Signal Words 
A signal word is a word that typically 
appears near the top of a warning, 
sometimes in all capital letters. 
Common examples include DANGER, 
WARNING, CAUTION, and NOTICE. 
The signal word is generally understood 
to serve a dual purpose: alerting the user 
to a hazard and indicating a particular 
level of hazard. For example, users 
generally perceive the word DEADLY to 
indicate a far greater degree of hazard 
than a term like NOTICE. 
The proposal prescribes one of two 
signal words for labels—DANGER or 
WARNING—depending on the hazard 
classification of the substance in 
question. These are the same two signal 
words used in the GHS. DANGER is 
used for the more severe hazard 
categories, while WARNING denotes a 
less serious hazard. These signal words 
are similar to those in other established 
hazard communication systems, except 
that some other systems have three or 
more tiers. For example, ANSI Z129.1 
(the American National Standard for 
Hazardous Industrial Chemicals— 
Precautionary Labeling) uses DANGER, 
WARNING, and CAUTION, in order of 
descending severity (ANSI, 2006). 
A number of recent studies have 
examined how people perceive signal 
words and, in particular, how they 
perceive signal words to be different 
from one another. Overall, this research 
supports the use of signal words in 
labels, demonstrating that they can 
attract attention and help people clearly 
distinguish between levels of hazard. 
The research also supports the decision 
to use only two tiers, as many recent 
studies have found clear differences 
between DANGER and WARNING but 
little perceived difference between 
WARNING and CAUTION. 
Wogalter et al. investigated the 
influence of signal words on 
perceptions of hazard for consumer 
products (Wogalter et al., 1992). Under 
the pretext of a marketing research 
study, 90 high school and college 
students rated product labels on 
variables such as product familiarity, 
frequency of use, and perceived hazard. 
Results showed that the presence of a 
signal word increased perceived hazard 
compared to its absence. Between 
extreme terms (e.g., NOTE and 
DANGER), significant differences were 
noted. 
Seeking to test warning signs in 
realistic settings, Adams et al. tested 
five industrial warning signs on a group 
of 40 blue-collar workers employed in 
heavy industry, as well as a group of 
students (Adams et al., 1998). Signs 
were manipulated to include four key 
elements (signal word, hazard 
statement, consequences statement, and 
instructions statement) or a subset of 
those elements. Participants were asked 
questions to gauge their reaction and 
behavioral intentions. Overall, 77 
percent (66 percent of the worker group) 
recognized DANGER as the key word 
when it appeared, and more than 80 
percent recognized BEWARE and 
CAUTION, suggesting that the signal 
word was generally noticed, and it was 
recognized as the key alerting element. 
DANGER was significantly more likely 
than other words to influence 
behavioral intentions. 
Laughery et al. also demonstrated the 
usefulness of signal words. The authors 
tested the warnings on alcoholic 
beverage containers in the U.S., and 
found that a signal word (WARNING) 
was one of several factors that decreased 
the amount of time it took for 
participants to locate the warning. 
(Laughery et al., 1993). 
Several studies have tested the 
arousal strength or perceived hazard of 
different signal words. Arousal strength 
is a term used to indicate the overall 
importance of the warning, and 
incorporates both the likelihood and 
severity of the potential threat. Silver 
and Wogalter tested the arousal strength 
of signal words on college students and 
found that DANGER connoted greater 
strength than WARNING and CAUTION 
(Silver and Wogalter, 1993). The results 
failed to show a difference between 
WARNING and CAUTION. Among other 
words tested, DEADLY was seen as 
having the strongest arousal 
connotation, and NOTE the least. 
Griffith and Leonard asked 80 female 
undergraduates (who were unlikely to 
have already received industrial safety 
training) to rate signal words. Results 
included a list of terms in order of 
‘‘meaningfulness,’’ representing 
conceptual ‘‘distance’’ from the neutral

term NOTICE (Griffith and Leonard, 
1997). From most to least meaningful, 
these terms were reported to be 
DANGER, URGENT, BEWARE, 
WARNING, STOP, CAUTION, and 
IMPORTANT. 
Wogalter et al. asked over 100 
undergraduates and community 
volunteers to rank signal words 
(Wogalter et al., 1998). DEADLY was 
perceived as most hazardous, followed 
by DANGER, WARNING, and 
CAUTION. All differences were 
statistically significant. In a follow-up 
experiment using labels produced in the 
ANSI Z535.2 (American National 
Standard for Environmental and Facility 
Safety Signs), ANSI Z535.4 (American 
National Standard for Product Safety 
Signs and Labels), and alternative 
formats, the authors found a similar 
rank order for signal words with all 
labeling systems. Finally, the authors 
tested the same terms on employees 
from manufacturing and assembly 
plants and found the same general 
order: DEADLY, then DANGER, then 
WARNING and CAUTION with no 
significant difference between the last 
two terms. 
In more of a free-form experiment, 
Young asked 30 subjects to produce 
warning signs for a set of scenarios, 
using different sign components 
available on a computer screen (Young, 
1998). In roughly 80 percent of the 
signs, the participant chose to use a 
signal word. DANGER, DEADLY, and 
LETHAL were more likely to be used for 
scenarios with severe hazards; 
CAUTION and NOTICE for non-severe 
scenarios. WARNING was used equally 
in both types of scenarios. The author 
suggests that these results support a 
two-tiered system of signal words. In a 
separate task, users ranked the 
perceived hazard of signal words, 
resulting in the following list from most 
to least severe: DEADLY, LETHAL, 
DANGER, WARNING, CAUTION, and 
NOTICE. 
While these studies have focused on 
the relative perceptions of signal words, 
others have sought to evaluate how the 
absolute meaning of common signal 
words is perceived. Drake et al. asked a 
group of students and community 
volunteers to match signal words with 
definitions borrowed from consensus 
standards and other sources (Drake et 
al., 1998). Participants matched 
DANGER to a correct definition 64 
percent of the time, while NOTICE was 
matched correctly 68 percent of the 
time. WARNING and CAUTION were 
matched correctly less than half of the 
time, suggesting confusion. The authors 
recommended using WARNING and 
CAUTION interchangeably. The authors 
also suggested that a standard set of 
signal words (but not synonyms) is 
helpful for users with limited English 
skills, who can be trained to recognize 
a few key words. 
Signal word perceptions are reported 
to be consistent among some non-U.S. 
populations, as well. Hellier et al. asked 
984 adults in the UK to rate DANGER, 
WARNING, and CAUTION on a hazard 
scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high) (Hellier 
et al., 2000a). DANGER was ranked as 
8.5, WARNING was ranked as 7.8, while 
CAUTION was rated as 7.25. These 
results are consistent with the findings 
of studies on subjects in the U.S. In a 
second study published in 2000, Hellier 
et al. asked a mixed-age group of 
participants in the UK to rate the 
arousal strength of 84 signal words 
commonly used in the U.S. (Hellier et 
al., 2000b).The authors found that 
DANGER is stronger than WARNING, 
while WARNING and CAUTION are not 
significantly different from each other. 
Similar results were found among 
workers in Zambia. Banda and 
Sichilongo tested GHS-style labels using 
four different signal words (as well as 
other variables) (Banda and Sichilongo, 
2006). Among workers in the industrial 
and transport sectors, DANGER was 
generally perceived as the most 
hazardous signal word. WARNING was 
one of a group of terms that were largely 
indistinguishable from one another, but 
distinct from DANGER. The authors 
support adoption of the GHS, suggesting 
that having just two possible signal 
words will lead to ‘‘more impact and 
less confusion about the extent of 
hazard.’’ 
In addition, comparable results were 
found in South Africa (London, 2003). 
In a large study on SDS and label 
comprehensibility conducted for South 
Africa’s National Economic 
Development and Labour Council 
(NEDLAC), DANGER was generally 
ranked as more hazardous than 
WARNING by participants in the four 
sectors tested: industry, transport, 
agriculture, and consumers. 
Cumulatively, these studies provide a 
clear indication that signal words are 
effective in alerting readers that a 
hazard exists, and in conveying the 
existence of a particular level of hazard. 
The studies have found a generally 
consistent hierarchy of signal words 
with respect to perceived hazard. 
DANGER and WARNING appear to 
connote different levels of hazard, while 
the perceived difference between 
WARNING and CAUTION is often 
insignificant. 
Pictograms 
A pictogram is a graphical 
composition that may include a symbol 
along with other graphical elements, 
such as a border or background color. A 
pictogram is a communication tool and 
is intended to convey specific 
information. 
The proposed rule includes 
requirements for use of eight different 
pictograms. Each of these pictograms 
consists of a different symbol in black 
on a white background within a red 
square frame set on a point (i.e., a red 
diamond). The specific pictograms that 
are required on a label would be 
determined based on the hazard 
classification of the substance in 
question. 
OSHA believes that the proposed 
pictograms would make warnings on 
labels more noticeable and easier for 
employees to understand. In particular, 
symbols are expected to improve 
comprehension among people with low 
literacy and those who are not literate 
in the English language. It should be 
remembered that pictograms would be 
used not only in conjunction with other 
label elements, but in the context of the 
hazard communication program as a 
whole. Training that includes an 
explanation of labels (included in the 
proposed rule) would ensure that 
pictograms are understood by 
employees. 
A considerable amount of evidence 
supports the belief that pictograms can 
serve as useful and effective 
communication tools. In reviewing this 
evidence, it should be noted that some 
sources offer distinct definitions for 
‘‘pictogram,’’ ‘‘pictorial,’’ ‘‘symbol,’’ and 
other terms describing graphical 
elements. For example, Rogers et al. 
state that: ‘‘Pictorials refer to pictures 
that represent the concept of interest 
(e.g., a picture of a fire extinguisher). 
Symbols are more abstract 
representations of a concept, the 
meaning of which must be learned (e.g., 
the use of a skull and crossbones to 
denote poison)’’ (Rogers et al., 2000). 
ANSI and others combine these terms in 
the definition of ‘‘symbol,’’ however, 
and for the purposes of discussing the 
literature on this subject, these terms are 
used interchangeably. 
Symbols serve several important 
functions in warning labels. As 
Wogalter et al. explain, symbols may 
alert the user to a hazard more 
effectively than text alone: 
Symbols may be more salient than text 
because of visual differentiations of shape, 
size, and color. Usually symbols have unique 
details and possess more differences in 
appearance than do the letters of the

alphabet. Letters are highly familiar and are 
more similar to one another than most 
graphical symbols (Wogalter et al., 2006). 
Symbols also can bolster a text message 
and improve label comprehension 
among individuals with low literacy, 
and those who do not understand the 
language in which the label text is 
written (Parsons et al., 1999). 
Several researchers have sought to 
evaluate how people comprehend 
symbols, including those symbols that 
are incorporated in the proposed rule. 
Some studies have found that the skull 
and crossbones icon—one of the 
symbols included in the proposed 
rule—is among the most recognizable 
safety symbols. For example, Wogalter 
et al. asked 112 undergraduates and 
community volunteers to rank various 
label elements (Wogalter et al., 1998). 
Among shapes and icons, the skull 
symbol (in this case, without the 
crossbones) was rated most hazardous 
and most noticeable. The skull connoted 
the greatest hazard among industrial 
employees as well. Smith-Jackson and 
Wogalter asked 48 English-speaking 
workers to rate the perceived hazards of 
six alerting symbols (Smith-Jackson and 
Wogalter, 2000). The skull was rated 
significantly higher than all other 
symbols. 
Some research has examined other 
pictograms included in the proposed 
rule. As part of an experiment to see 
how individuals comprehend warnings 
on household chemical labels, 
Akerboom and Trommelen asked 60 
university students whether they 
understood the meaning of several 
pictograms, including four that are 
included in the proposed rule 
(Akerboom and Trommelen, 1998). The 
authors reported the following levels of 
comprehension for these pictograms: 
• Flame: 93 percent comprehension; 
• Skull and crossbones: 85 percent 
comprehension; 
• Corrosion: 20 percent 
comprehension; and 
• Flame over circle: 13 percent 
comprehension. 
Only the flame and skull and 
crossbones pictograms met the 85 
percent comprehension criteria 
suggested by ANSI Z535.3 (the 
American National Standard Criteria for 
Safety Symbols) (ANSI, 2002a). The 
authors recommend that labels present 
the hazard phrase [statement] and 
symbol together, along with 
corresponding precautions, as would be 
required under the proposed rule. 
Banda and Sichilongo tested 
comprehension of labels that included 
the proposed pictograms among 364 
workers in four sectors in Zambia 
(transport, agriculture, industrial, and 
household consumers) (Banda and 
Sichilongo, 2006). Within this 
population, the skull and crossbones 
symbol was widely understood, as was 
the ‘‘flame’’ symbol. Based on these 
results, the authors suggest a preference 
for symbols that depict familiar, 
meaningful, and recognizable images. 
London performed a similar study 
among the same four sectors in South 
Africa, finding that the skull and 
crossbones was understood by at least 
96 percent of each sector and ‘‘flame’’ 
by at least 89 percent (London, 2003). 
‘‘Exploding bomb’’ was correctly 
comprehended by 44 to 71 percent of 
each sector. Many health-related 
symbols did not fare well, and six 
symbols had less than 50 percent 
comprehension across all four sectors. 
Outside the transport sector, ‘‘Gas 
cylinder’’ was the least well 
comprehended symbol. 
These findings indicate that some of 
the pictograms included in the proposed 
rule are already widely recognized by a 
general audience. Others, however, are 
not commonly understood. Therefore, 
simply adding some of the proposed 
pictograms on labels will not provide 
useful information unless efforts are 
also undertaken to ensure that 
employees understand the meaning of 
the pictograms. As Wogalter et al. noted, 
some studies have found slower 
processing, poorer recognition, and 
greater learning difficulties with 
symbols versus with text—particularly 
if the symbols are complex or non- 
intuitive (Wogalter et al., 2006). These 
results emphasize the need to train 
employees on the meaning of the 
pictograms that would be included on 
chemical labels. 
Where pictograms are used and 
understood, communication of hazards 
can be improved. Houts et al. studied 
long-term recall of spoken medical 
instructions when accompanied by a 
handout with pictograms (Houts et al., 
2001). Nearly 200 pictograms were 
tested with 21 low-literate adults (less 
than grade 5 reading level). Immediately 
after training, participants recalled the 
meaning of 85 percent of the 
pictograms, and they recalled 71 percent 
after 4 weeks. This study found that 
recall was better for simple pictograms 
where there is a direct relationship 
between the image and its meaning— 
that is, where no inference is required. 
Another body of literature focuses on 
the utility of symbols in general. Ganier 
found that people generally construct 
mental representations faster with 
pictures than they do with text, 
supporting earlier findings on the 
usefulness of symbols (Ganier, 2001). 
Evans et al. found similar results with 
a task in which undergraduates were 
asked to sort items into categories using 
either text clues, visual clues, or a 
combination of pictures and text (Evans 
et al., 2002). When categories were fixed 
(i.e., sorting instructions were specific), 
people sorted the cards more 
consistently with one another when 
presented with pictures than when 
presented with text alone. 
In a follow-up article on the South 
African study mentioned previously, 
Dowse and Ehlers found that patients 
receiving antibiotics adhered to 
instructions much better when the 
instructions included pictograms (54 
percent with high adherence, versus 2 
percent when given text-only 
instructions) (Dowse and Ehlers, 2005). 
Pictograms also serve to attract 
attention to the hazard warnings on a 
label. To examine factors that influence 
the effectiveness of pharmaceutical 
labels, Kalsher et al. asked subjects to 
rate the noticeability, ease of reading, 
and overall appeal of labels with or 
without pictorials (Kalsher et al., 1996). 
A group of 84 undergraduates gave 
consistently higher ratings to labels with 
pictorials. A group of elderly subjects 
had similar preferences, rating labels 
with pictorials as significantly more 
noticeable and likely to be read. 
Laughery et al. found similar results 
with a timed test on alcoholic beverage 
labels (Laughery et al., 1993). When a 
pictorial was present to the left of the 
warning showing what not to do when 
drinking, the amount of time it took to 
find the label was significantly reduced. 
An icon consisting of the alert symbol 
(an exclamation mark set within a 
triangle) and the signal word WARNING 
also decreased response time. The 
fastest response time came when four 
different enhancements (including the 
pictorial and the icon) were included. In 
a follow-up exercise, an eye scan test 
found that the pictorial had a 
particularly strong influence on reaction 
time, compared with other 
enhancements. 
As far as chemical labels are 
concerned, London found that symbols 
tend to be the most easily recalled label 
elements (London, 2003). In the 
comprehensibility test of labels among 
South African workers mentioned 
previously, symbols were the most 
commonly recalled elements— 
particularly the skull and crossbones— 
and people recalled looking at symbols 
first. Symbols were also cited as by far 
the most important factor in 
determining hazard perception. Overall, 
the author concludes that ‘‘Symbols are 
therefore key to attracting attention, and 
informing risk perception regarding a 
chemical.’’

Wogalter et al. found less encouraging 
evidence on pictorials, however 
(Wogalter et al., 1993). The authors 
tested the influence of various warning 
variables on whether subjects wore 
proper protective equipment during a 
task involving measuring and mixing 
chemicals. Warning location and the 
amount of clutter around the warning 
had significant effects on compliance, 
but the presence or absence of pictorials 
did not. 
Meingast asked subjects to recall 
warning content after viewing labels 
that were considered either high quality 
(with color signal icons, pictorials, and 
organized text conforming to ANSI 
Z535.4, the American National Standard 
for Product Safety Signs and Labels) or 
low quality (text only) (Meingast, 2001). 
Pictorials were the items remembered 
most often, accounting for 48 percent of 
what viewers of high quality labels 
recalled. The author suggests that these 
pictorials also served the role of dual 
coding, meaning that they help to 
improve the retention of corresponding 
text. 
Other recent studies support this 
dual-coding function of pictorials, 
finding that symbols tend to be most 
effective when paired with redundant or 
reinforcing text. For example, Sojourner 
and Wogalter asked 35 participants to 
rate several prescription label formats in 
terms of ease of reading, ease of 
understanding, overall effectiveness, 
likelihood of reading, overall 
preference, pictorial understanding, and 
how helpful pictorials are in helping to 
remember the instructions (Sojourner 
and Wogalter, 1997). The authors found 
that people prefer fully redundant text 
and pictorials, which they judged 
easiest to read, most effective, and 
preferred overall. Dual-coded pictorials 
aided understanding and memory more 
than labels with pictorials only (no 
text). In a follow-up study, Sojourner 
and Wogalter gave undergraduates, 
young adults, and older adults a free 
recall test after viewing medication 
labels (Sojourner and Wogalter, 1998). 
Fully redundant text and pictorials led 
to significantly greater recall than other 
formats, and were rated most effective 
by all age groups. 
Similarly, Sansgiry et al. found that 
pictograms on over-the-counter drug 
labels improved comprehension, but 
only when they were congruent with the 
corresponding text (Sansgiry et al., 
1997). A group of 96 adults were less 
confused, more satisfied, more certain 
about their knowledge, and understood 
more when shown labels that contained 
congruent pictures and verbal 
instructions, versus verbal instructions 
alone. The results were significantly 
better with congruent pictures and text 
than with either pictures alone or 
incongruent pictures and text. 
Some evidence links use of 
pictograms directly to safer behavior. 
Jaynes and Boles investigated whether 
different warning designs, specifically 
those with symbols, affect compliance 
rates (Jaynes and Boles, 1993). Five 
conditions were tested: a verbal 
warning, a pictograph warning with a 
circle enclosing each graphic, a 
pictograph warning with a triangle on 
its vertex enclosing each graphic, a 
warning with both words and 
pictographs, and a control (no warning). 
Participants performed a chemistry 
laboratory task using a set of 
instructions that contained one of the 
five conditions. The warnings instructed 
them to wear safety goggles, mask and 
gloves. All four warning conditions had 
significantly greater compliance than 
the no-warning condition. A significant 
effect was also found for the ‘‘presence 
of pictographs’’ variable, suggesting that 
the addition of pictographs will increase 
compliance rates. 
In addition to the evidence pertaining 
to the other graphical elements in 
pictograms, research indicates that the 
use of the color red in pictograms will 
serve to make warnings more noticeable. 
Red is also generally perceived to reflect 
the greatest degree of hazard, and is thus 
well-suited to identifying serious 
chemical hazards in the workplace. 
In their review of the literature on 
warning effectiveness on behavioral 
compliance, Kalsher and Williams 
summarize several studies that 
examined the effects of adding color to 
warnings (Kalsher and Williams, 2006). 
Overall, Kalsher and Williams suggest 
that adding color can influence both the 
noticeability and effectiveness of 
warnings. 
In a test on the noticeability of 
warnings, Swindell measured the 
amount of time it took subjects to locate 
warning text that had been embedded in 
medication instructions (Swindell, 
1999). Warnings were found 
significantly faster when the icon and 
signal word were presented in either red 
or blue, causing the warning to stand 
out from the black text. Swindell’s 
findings echo the results reported by 
Laughery et al., who found that 
alcoholic beverage labels were located 
significantly faster when the text was 
red instead of black (Laughery et al., 
1993). While these studies involve color 
on label elements other than the 
pictogram border, they provide a general 
indication that color attracts the 
attention of label users. 
A number of researchers have 
investigated the hazard connotations of 
different colors. These investigations 
indicate that red is generally perceived 
to reflect the greatest degree of hazard. 
Yellow, orange, and black reflect a 
lesser degree of hazard. In a review of 
the literature, Parsons et al. suggest that 
the red-orange-yellow hierarchy 
generally matches people’s perceptions 
of risk, including perceptions among 
native Spanish speakers (Parsons et al., 
1999). Experimental results that support 
the conclusion that red generally 
connotes the highest degree of hazard 
include: 
› Smith-Jackson and Wogalter asked 
English-speaking community members 
to rate the perceived hazard of ten ANSI 
safety colors (Smith-Jackson and 
Wogalter, 2000). Red, yellow, black, and 
orange were rated the highest (in 
descending order). Differences were 
statistically significant except the 
difference between yellow and black. 
› Among 80 college students asked 
to rate colors by Griffith and Leonard, 
red was rated the most ‘‘meaningful’’ 
color (i.e., most distinct in meaning 
from neutral gray), followed by green, 
orange, black, white, blue, and yellow 
(Griffith and Leonard, 1997). 
› Wogalter et al. asked Spanish 
speakers to rank the perceived hazard of 
ANSI safety colors (Wogalter et al., 
1997b). Red was ranked highest, 
followed by orange, black, and yellow. 
› Dunlap et al. surveyed 1169 
subjects across several different 
language groups including English, 
German, and Spanish speakers (Dunlap 
et al., 1986). Subjects rated the color 
words red, orange, yellow, blue, green, 
and white according to the level of 
perceived hazard. The results 
demonstrated that the hazard 
information communicated by different 
colors followed a consistent pattern 
across language groups, with red having 
the highest hazard ratings. 
› Wogalter et al. asked 
undergraduates and community 
volunteers to rank various warning 
components (Wogalter et al., 1998). Red 
connoted a significantly greater hazard 
than other colors, followed by yellow, 
orange, and black (in that order). A 
group of industrial workers ranked the 
colors from greatest to least hazard as 
follows: red, yellow, black, orange. 
› London asked workers in four 
sectors in South Africa to rank the 
colors red, yellow, green, and blue in 
terns of perceived hazard; 95 percent 
said red represents the greatest hazard, 
and 58 percent said yellow is the second 
greatest hazard (London, 2003). 
› Banda and Sichilongo asked 
workers in Zambia to rate the perceived 
hazard of various colors used in 
chemical labels (Banda and Sichilongo,

50297 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
2006). Red was associated with the 
greatest hazard, followed by yellow. 
› Among a sample of 30 
undergraduates who rated the perceived 
hazard of 105 signal word/color 
combinations, Braun et al. reported that 
red conveyed the highest level of 
perceived hazard followed by orange, 
black, green, and blue (Braun et al., 
1994). 
These reports are consistent in 
indicating that red is commonly 
understood to be associated with a high 
level of hazard—the highest of any 
color. OSHA anticipates that by using 
the color red on labels for hazardous 
chemicals, labels will be more effective 
in communicating hazards to 
employees—both by drawing the 
attention of employees and indicating 
the presence of a hazard through non- 
verbal means. 
Hazard and Precautionary Statements 
Hazard statements describe the 
hazards associated with a chemical. 
Precautionary statements describe 
recommended measures that should be 
taken to protect against hazardous 
exposures, or improper storage or 
handling of a chemical. The HCS 
currently includes a performance- 
oriented requirement for ‘‘appropriate 
hazard warnings’’ on labels. The 
proposed rule would require specific 
hazard statements and precautionary 
statements on labels. The statements 
would be determined based on the 
hazard classification of the chemical. 
Standardized requirements for hazard 
and precautionary statements would 
provide a degree of consistency that is 
currently lacking among chemical 
labels. This lack of consistency makes it 
difficult in some instances for users to 
understand the nature and degree of 
hazard associated with a chemical, and 
to compare chemical hazards. For 
example, Beach relates experiences from 
the perspective of a doctor treating 
occupationally exposed patients (Beach, 
2002). The author noted that different 
suppliers use different risk phrases for 
the same chemical, making it difficult 
for users to compare relative risks. 
ANSI standard Z129.1 was developed 
to provide a consistent approach to 
labeling of hazardous chemicals. This 
standard gives manufacturers and 
importers guidance on how to provide 
information on a label, including 
standardized phrases and other 
information that can improve the 
quality of labels. Because it is a 
voluntary standard, however, the ANSI 
approach has not been adopted by all 
chemical manufacturers and importers. 
As a result of the diverse formats and 
language used, consistent and 
understandable presentation of 
information has not been fully achieved. 
A preference for hazard statements 
was shown in EPA’s Consumer Labeling 
Initiative (Abt Associates, 1999). This 
study asked consumers about their 
attitudes toward labels on household 
chemical products. Overall, consumers 
indicated that they like to have 
information that clearly connects 
consequences with actions, and they 
prefer to know why they are being 
instructed to take a particular 
precaution. A clear hazard statement 
can provide this information. 
In some cases, clear and concise 
precautionary information is necessary 
to enable employees to identify 
appropriate protective measures. For 
example, Frantz et al. examined the 
impact of flame and poison warning 
symbols prescribed in certain 
regulations by the Canadian government 
(Frantz et al., 1994). The results suggest 
that although the generic meanings of 
these two symbols are well understood, 
people may have difficulty inferring the 
specific safety precautions necessary for 
a particular product. 
Other reports have indicated that 
users prefer information that includes 
both an indication of the hazard and the 
recommended action (i.e., the 
precautionary statement). Braun et al. 
examined statements in product 
instructions for a pool treatment 
chemical and a polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) adhesive, asking subjects to rate 
the injury risk posed by each product 
(Braun et al., 1995). The experimenters 
manipulated the instructions to include 
either recommended actions only, 
actions followed by consequences, 
consequences followed by actions, or a 
simple restatement of the product label. 
The authors found that actions paired 
with consequences led to significantly 
higher risk perception than a 
restatement of the label or actions alone. 
Although the preferred wording was 
longer than the alternatives, subjects did 
not feel that the instructions were too 
complex, suggesting that they appreciate 
having actions and consequences paired 
together. Freeman echoed these findings 
in a discussion on communicating 
health risks to fishermen and farmers, 
noting that to be useful, risk statements 
should be balanced with equally strong 
statements of ways to reduce or avoid 
the risk (Freeman, 2001). 
Explicit precautionary statements may 
make it more likely that employees will 
take appropriate precautions. Bowles et 
al. asked subjects to review product 
warnings, then either decide what 
actions they should take or evaluate 
whether someone else’s actions were 
safe, based on the warning (Bowles et 
al., 2002). In general, situations that 
required the user to make inferences 
about a hazard—particularly when they 
had to come up with their own ideas for 
protective actions—led to decreased 
intent to comply. By providing clear 
precautionary instructions on the label, 
the proposed rule would eliminate the 
need for users to infer protective 
actions. 
Some evidence indicates that using 
key label elements together can improve 
warning performance, compared with 
labels that only contain a subset of these 
elements. This is the approach taken in 
the proposed rule, which would require 
the signal word, pictogram(s), hazard 
statement(s), and precautionary 
statement(s) together on the label. In one 
study, Meingast asked students to recall 
information from two variations of 
warning labels: enhanced warnings with 
color, signal icons, pictorials, and 
organized text (following the ANSI 
Z535.4 standard); and warnings with 
text only (Meingast, 2001). The authors 
reported that the enhanced warnings 
were more noticeable, led to 
significantly greater recall, and made 
people report a higher likelihood of 
compliance. 
Other findings agree that improving 
all label elements can improve warning 
performance. For example, Lehto tested 
information retrieval from three 
chemical label formats and found that 
subjects generally did best with an 
‘‘extensive’’ format that included 
pictograms, paragraphs, and horizontal 
bars indicating the degree of hazard 
(Lehto, 1998). Subjects were able to 
answer more questions correctly when 
the label included a range of content— 
particularly information on first aid and 
spill procedures. 
Wogalter et al. reported similar results 
in a test of four different signs that 
discouraged people from using an 
elevator for short trips (Wogalter et al., 
1997a). Three signs were text-only. The 
fourth sign had a signal word panel, 
icons, a pictorial, and more explicit 
wording indicating the desired behavior 
(i.e., ‘‘use the stairs’’). Subjects rated the 
enhanced sign as more understandable, 
and a field test found that it 
significantly increased compliance over 
the other options. 
The effectiveness of a combination of 
elements was also investigated in a 
study of warnings on alcoholic beverage 
containers (Laughery et al., 1993). 
Laughery et al. tested warnings to 
determine which elements influenced 
noticeability. The authors manipulated 
labels by adding a pictorial, adding an 
alert symbol with a signal word, making 
the text red, and/or adding a border 
around the warning. The warning was

located fastest when all four of these 
modifications were present, suggesting 
that the best designs include a 
combination of enhancements. 
These findings support the belief that 
the proposed label elements, in 
combination, would likely be more 
effective in communicating hazard 
information than the individual 
elements would be if presented alone. 
Although the warnings examined in 
these studies are different than those 
included in the proposed rule, they 
indicate that enhancements such as 
color and symbols can increase the 
effectiveness of a label, and that 
presenting hazard information and 
corresponding precautions together may 
improve understanding. OSHA therefore 
believes that this evidence substantiates 
its belief that the proposed labeling 
requirements will result in more 
effective transmittal of information to 
employees. 
Overall, the presentation of 
information on labels through 
standardized signal words, hazard 
statements, pictograms, and 
precautionary statements would provide 
clearer, more consistent, and more 
complete information to chemical users. 
Comments received in response to the 
ANPR support this view (e.g., Document 
ID #s 0054, 0032, 0124, 0124, and 0158). 
For example, the Refractory Ceramic 
Fibers Coalition (Document ID #0030) 
pointed to the benefits of this approach, 
stating: 
Employers and employees would be given 
the same information on a chemical 
regardless of the supplier. This consistency 
should improve communication of the 
hazards. It may also improve communication 
for those who are not functionally literate, or 
who are not literate in the language written 
on the label. In addition, having the core 
information developed already, translated 
into multiple languages, and readily available 
to whomever wishes to access it, should 
eliminate the burden on manufacturers and 
users to develop and maintain their own 
such systems. Thus the specification 
approach should be beneficial both to the 
producers and the users of chemicals. 
Labels are intended to provide an 
immediate visual reminder of chemical 
hazards. Whereas labels currently may 
be presented in a variety of formats 
using inconsistent terminology and 
visual elements, labels prepared in 
accordance with the proposed 
requirements would be consistent. 
Standardized signal words and hazard 
statements would attract attention and 
communicate the degree of hazard. 
Pictograms would reinforce the message 
presented in text and enhance 
communication for low-literacy 
populations. Precautionary statements 
would provide useful instructions for 
protecting against chemical-source 
injuries and illnesses. 
Safety Data Sheets 
The HCS requires chemical 
manufacturers and importers to develop 
an SDS for each hazardous chemical 
they produce or import. SDSs serve as 
a source of detailed information on 
chemical hazards and protective 
measures. Each SDS must indicate the 
identity of the chemical used on the 
label; the chemical and common 
name(s) of hazardous ingredients; 
physical and chemical characteristics; 
physical and health hazards; the 
primary route(s) of entry; exposure 
limits; generally applicable precautions 
for safe handling and use; generally 
applicable control measures; emergency 
and first aid procedures; the date of 
preparation of the SDS; and the name, 
address and telephone number of the 
party preparing or distributing the SDS. 
The HCS does not require this 
information to be presented in any 
particular order or to follow a specific 
format. 
Since the HCS was adopted in 1983, 
access to chemical information has 
improved dramatically due to the 
availability of SDSs. While the 
effectiveness of SDSs is evident, there 
are concerns regarding the quality of 
information provided. In particular, 
concerns have been raised regarding the 
accuracy (i.e., the correctness and 
completeness of the information 
provided) and comprehensibility (i.e., 
the ability of users to understand the 
information presented) of information 
provided on SDSs. 
OSHA is proposing a requirement that 
the information on SDSs be presented 
using consistent headings in the 
sequence specified in the GHS (see 
Section XV for a detailed discussion of 
the proposed requirements). The 
Agency believes that a standardized 
order of information would improve the 
utility of SDSs by making it easier for 
users to locate and understand the 
information they are seeking. A 
standardized format would also be 
expected to improve the accuracy of the 
information presented on SDSs. 
A number of studies have 
demonstrated the benefits provided by 
SDSs. In May 1992, the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report 
presenting the findings of an 
examination of difficulties small 
employers were said to experience in 
complying with the HCS, as well as 
issues relating to the costs of 
compliance (GAO, 1992). The findings 
were based on the results of a national 
survey of construction, manufacturing, 
and personal services providers. A total 
of 1,120 responses were received from 
employers. 
One very important finding of the 
GAO survey was that almost 30% of 
employers reported that they had 
replaced a hazardous chemical with a 
less hazardous substitute because of 
information presented on an SDS. With 
regard to the HCS as a whole, GAO 
found that over 56% of employers 
reported ‘‘great’’ or ‘‘very great’’ 
improvement in the availability of 
hazard information in the workplace 
and in management’s awareness of 
workplace hazards. Forty-five percent of 
those in compliance with the HCS 
considered the standard to have a 
positive effect on employees, compared 
with only 9% who viewed the effect as 
negative. The results indicate that when 
chemical hazard information is 
provided, the result is generally 
recognized as beneficial to employees. 
A number of other studies support 
this conclusion. For example, in a 
survey of 160 workers at a large national 
laboratory, more than 90 percent of 
respondents said that SDSs are 
satisfactory or very satisfactory in 
providing protective information and 
answering questions (Phillips et al., 
1999). 
Conklin demonstrated the utility of 
SDSs among employees of a 
multinational petrochemical company 
(Conklin, 2003). Across three countries 
(the U.S., Canada, and the United 
Kingdom), 98 percent felt that the SDS 
is a satisfactory information source (the 
percentage was similar across all three 
countries). Seventy-two percent said 
they would request an SDS all or most 
of the time when introduced to a new 
chemical, although 46 percent of 
workers said that SDSs are too long. The 
author notes, however, that this sample 
did not include any workers with low 
literacy. 
A number of investigations have 
raised concerns that, in some cases, the 
information on SDSs is not 
comprehensible to employees. In 1991, 
OSHA commissioned a study that 
evaluated the comprehensibility of SDSs 
by a group of unionized employees in 
manufacturing industries located in the 
State of Maryland (Kearney/Centaur, 
1991). The study assessed the ability of 
these employees to understand 
information regarding the route of entry 
of the substance, the type of health 
hazard present, appropriate protective 
measures, and sources of additional 
help. 
Each of the 91 participating workers 
was provided with and tested on four 
different SDSs. The workers answered 
the test questions based on information

supplied on each of the SDSs. It should 
be noted that the employees who 
volunteered for this study understood 
that it relied on reading comprehension. 
This created a selection bias, as 
employees with reading difficulties 
would not be likely to volunteer for the 
study. 
The results of the tests indicated that 
workers on average understood about 
two-thirds of the health and safety 
information on the SDSs. The best 
comprehension was associated with 
information providing straightforward 
procedures to follow (e.g., in furnishing 
first aid, dealing with a fire, or in using 
personal protective equipment) or 
descriptions of how a chemical 
substance can enter the body. Workers 
had greater difficulty understanding 
health information addressing different 
target organs, particularly when more 
technical language was used. Workers 
also reportedly had difficulty 
distinguishing acute from chronic 
effects based on information presented 
in the SDSs. 
A similar result was reported by 
Conklin in a study involving employees 
of a multinational petrochemical 
company (Conklin, 2003). After viewing 
information on an unfamiliar chemical 
in a variety of SDS formats, a 
questionnaire was administered to 
workers to gauge their comprehension 
of the material presented. The workers 
reportedly answered 65 percent of the 
questions correctly. 
A study that examined the 
comprehensibility of SDS to master 
printers was reported by the Printing 
Industries of America in 1990 (PIA, 
1990). The subjects had an average of 
13.9 years of formal education, or 
approximately two years beyond high 
school. In this study, 27 SDSs were 
selected and analyzed for reading levels 
using a software program, finding an 
average reading grade level of 14. The 
investigators found that employees with 
15 years of education or more 
understood 66.2% of the information 
presented. 
Some of the difficulty workers 
experience in understanding 
information presented on SDSs may be 
due to the vocabulary used in the 
document. Information presented at a 
reading level that exceeds the capability 
of the user is unlikely to be well 
understood. An example of this 
situation was reported by Frazier et al. 
(Frazier et al., 2001). The authors 
evaluated a sample of SDSs from 30 
manufacturers of toluene diisocyanate, a 
chemical known to cause asthma. Half 
of the SDSs indicated that asthma was 
a potential health effect. One SDS made 
no mention of any respiratory effects, 
while others used language (e.g., allergic 
respiratory sensitization) that the 
authors believed may not clearly 
communicate that asthma is a risk. 
However, the more technical language 
meets the requirements of the HCS. 
Other reports substantiate the belief 
that many SDS users have difficulty 
understanding the information on the 
documents. For example, in a study 
evaluating the comprehensibility of 
SDSs at a large research laboratory, 39 
percent of the workers found SDSs 
‘‘difficult to understand’’ (Phillips, 
1997). The study also indicated that a 
third of the information provided on 
SDSs was not understood. These results 
were obtained from a study population 
of literate, trained workers who spoke 
English as their first language. 
Smith-Jackson and Wogalter 
corroborated this finding in a study 
involving 60 undergraduates and 
community volunteers (Smith-Jackson 
and Wogalter, 1998). The subjects were 
asked to sort SDS data into a logical 
order. After completing the task, 
subjects were asked for their opinions 
on the difficulty of the content. Overall, 
43 percent found the information easy 
to understand, 42 percent said it was 
not easy, and the remaining 15 percent 
felt that only scientists, experts, or very 
experienced workers would be able to 
understand the information. 
These studies are consistent in 
reporting that workers have difficulty 
understanding a substantial portion of 
the information presented on SDSs. This 
finding can be explained at least in part 
by the fact that not all of the information 
on SDSs is intended for workers. SDSs 
are intended to provide detailed 
technical information on a hazardous 
chemical. While they serve as a 
reference source for exposed employees, 
SDSs are also meant for other audiences 
as well. SDSs provide information for 
the benefit of emergency responders, 
industrial hygienists, safety 
professionals, and health care providers. 
Much of this information may be of a 
technical nature and would not be 
readily understood by individuals who 
do not have training or experience in 
these areas. For example, language that 
may be readily understood by a 
population of firefighters may be poorly 
understood by chemical workers. 
In addition, Title III of the Superfund 
Amendments and Reauthorization Act 
(SARA, also known as the Emergency 
Response and Community Right-to- 
Know Act of 1986) mandated that SDSs 
be made available to State emergency 
response commissions, local emergency 
planning committees, and fire 
departments in order to assist in 
planning and response to emergencies, 
as well as to provide members of the 
general public with information about 
chemicals used in their communities. It 
is difficult, if not impossible, for a 
document to meet the informational 
needs of all of these audiences while 
being comprehensible to all as well. 
Product liability concerns also play a 
role in the comprehensibility of SDSs. 
Producers of chemicals may be subject 
to ‘‘failure to warn’’ lawsuits that can 
have significant financial implications. 
Attempts to protect themselves against 
lawsuits can affect the length and 
complexity of SDSs, as well as the way 
in which information is presented. 
In some cases the length and 
complexity of SDSs reportedly make it 
difficult to locate desired information 
on the documents. For example, in 
testimony before the U.S. Senate 
Subcommittee on Employment, Safety, 
and Training, one hospital safety 
director described a situation in which 
an employee was unable to find critical 
information on an SDS in an emergency 
situation: 
* * * two gallons of the chemical xylene 
spilled in the lab of my hospital. By the time 
an employee had noticed the spill, the 
ventilation had already sucked most of the 
vapors into the HVAC. This, in turn, became 
suspended in the ceiling tile over our 
radiology department. Twelve employees 
were sent to the emergency room. To make 
the matter worse, the lab employee was 
frantically searching through the MSDS 
binder in her area for the xylene MSDS. Once 
she found it, she had difficulty locating the 
spill response section. After notifying our 
engineering department, she began to clean 
up the spill with solid waste rags, known for 
spontaneous combustion, and placing the 
rags into a clear plastic bag for disposal. She 
did not know that xylene has a flash point 
of 75 degrees Fahrenheit. She then walked 
the bag down to our incinerator room and left 
it there, basically creating a live bomb. 
Twelve people were treated from this 
exposure. The lab employee was very upset 
and concerned about the safety of the 
affected employees and visitors, and 
hysterically kept stating that she could not 
find the necessary spill response information 
(Hanson, 2004). 
SDSs at this particular hospital were 
reported to range from one page to 65 
pages in length. 
To accommodate the needs of the 
diverse groups who rely on SDSs, a 
standardized format has been viewed as 
a way to make the information on SDSs 
easier for users to find, and to segregate 
technical sections of the document from 
more basic elements. A standardized 
format was also thought to facilitate 
computerized information retrieval 
systems and to simplify employee 
training. 
OSHA established a voluntary format 
for SDSs in 1985 to assist manufacturers

and importers who desired some 
guidance in organizing SDS 
information. This 2-page form (OSHA 
Form 174) includes spaces for each of 
the items included in the SDS 
requirements of the standard, to be 
filled in with the appropriate 
information as determined by the 
manufacturer or importer. However, 
some members of the regulated 
community desired a more 
comprehensive, structured approach for 
developing clear, complete, and 
consistent SDSs. 
In order to develop this structure, the 
Chemical Manufacturers Association 
(now known as the American Chemistry 
Council) formed a committee to 
establish guidelines for the preparation 
of SDSs. This effort resulted in the 
development of American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) standard 
Z400.1, a voluntary consensus standard 
for the preparation of SDSs. Employers, 
workers, health care professionals, 
emergency responders, and other SDS 
users participated in the development 
process. The standard established a 16- 
section format for presenting 
information as well as standardized 
headings for sections of the SDS. An 
updated version of the ANSI standard 
published in 2004 is consistent with the 
GHS format that is included in the 
proposed rule. 
By following the recommended 
format, the information of greatest 
concern to employees is featured at the 
beginning of the document, including 
information on ingredients and first aid 
measures. More technical information 
that addresses topics such as the 
physical and chemical properties of the 
material and toxicological data appears 
later in the document. The ANSI 
standard also includes guidance on the 
appearance and reading level of the text 
in order to provide a document that can 
be easily understood by readers. 
OSHA currently allows the ANSI 
format to be used as long as the SDS 
includes all of the information required 
by the HCS. Because it is a voluntary 
standard, however, the ANSI format has 
not been adopted by all chemical 
manufacturers and importers. As a 
result, different formats are still used on 
many SDSs. 
The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) has published its 
own standard for SDS preparation. This 
standard, ISO 11014–1, has been revised 
for consistency with the GHS (new 
version issued in 2009). The standard 
includes the same 16 sections as the 
GHS, as well as similar data 
requirements in each section. These two 
consensus standards, ANSI Z400.1– 
2004 and ISO 11014–1 (2009), have 
essentially the same provisions and are 
consistent with GHS. There are minor 
differences, such as units of measure 
recommended in the national ANSI 
standard versus the international ISO 
standard. 
Another development has been the 
creation of International Chemical 
Safety Cards (ICSCs). The documents, 
developed by the International 
Programme on Chemical Safety, 
summarize essential health and safety 
information on chemicals for use at the 
‘‘shop floor’’ level by workers and 
employers (Niemeier, 1997). ICSCs are 
intended to present information in a 
concise and simple manner, and they 
follow a standardized format that is 
shorter (one double-sided page) and less 
complex than the ANSI approach. The 
ICSCs were field tested in their initial 
stages of development, and new ICSCs 
are verified and peer reviewed by 
internationally recognized experts 
(Niemeier, 1997). ICSCs have been 
developed in English for 1,646 
chemicals, and are also available in 16 
other languages. The ICSCs are being 
updated to be consistent with the GHS. 
A study by Phillips compared the 
effectiveness of different SDS formats as 
well as ICSCs among workers at a large 
national laboratory (Phillips, 1997). The 
employees represented a variety of 
trades, including painters, carpenters, 
truck drivers, and general laborers. Each 
worker was tested for knowledge 
regarding a hazardous chemical before 
and after viewing an SDS or ICSC. Three 
designs were tested: a 9-section OSHA 
form, the 16-section ANSI Z400.1 format 
(an earlier and slightly different version 
of the current ANSI Z400.1 format), and 
the 9-section ICSC. A subsequent paper 
described the final results of this study 
(Phillips, 1999). All three formats led to 
significant improvements in subjects’ 
knowledge, and there was no 
statistically significant difference among 
the three formats in terms of total test 
score. However, there were a few 
significant differences in how well 
readers of each SDS format answered 
specific types of questions: 
• The ICSC performed better than the 
OSHA form regarding chronic and 
immediate health effects. 
• The other two formats performed 
better than the ANSI format on fire- 
related questions. 
• The OSHA form performed better 
than the other two formats on spill 
response questions. 
• The OSHA form was better than the 
ANSI format regarding carcinogenic 
potential. 
In a separate comparison, Conklin 
also found similarities in the overall 
performance of several standard SDS 
formats (Conklin, 2003). In this study, 
employees of a multinational 
petrochemical company were given one 
of three versions of an SDS for an 
unfamiliar chemical: a U.S. version 
(OSHA’s required content within an 
ANSI Z400.1–1998 16-part structure); a 
Canadian version following the 9-part 
structure prescribed by Canada’s 
Workplace Hazardous Materials 
Information System (WHMIS); and a 
version following the European Union’s 
content and 16-part structure. SDSs 
were controlled for font, layout, and 
reading level. Overall, Conklin found no 
statistically significant difference in 
mean post-test scores using the three 
different formats, although there were 
significant differences on 5 out of 10 
questions (no one format was 
consistently better). 
Because extensive searching can be a 
barrier to SDS use, researchers have 
examined whether there is a preferred 
order of information that more closely 
matches users’ cognitive expectations. 
Smith-Jackson and Wogalter asked 60 
undergraduates and community 
volunteers to arrange portions of six 
SDSs in the order they considered most 
usable (Smith-Jackson and Wogalter, 
1998). The authors found a few 
consistent results: 
• Information about health hazards, 
protective equipment, and fire and 
explosion data tended to be placed 
toward the beginning. 
• Physical and reactivity data tended 
to be placed near the end. 
• Spill or leak procedures were 
placed near the beginning or the middle, 
depending on the type of chemical. 
A majority of subjects reported that 
they had attempted to prioritize the 
hazard information that needed to be 
communicated. The participants’ 
suggested order of information generally 
did not match either the original SDS 
order or the order listed in the HCS— 
particularly the subjects’ emphasis on 
health hazard information near the 
beginning. 
In the previously discussed 1991 
study that evaluated the 
comprehensibility of SDSs by a group of 
91 unionized workers in manufacturing 
industries in the State of Maryland, a 
subset of the group (18 workers) was 
also tested on an ICSC (Kearney/Centaur 
1991). While the results indicated that 
workers on average understood about 
two-thirds of the health and safety 
information on SDSs, ICSCs provided 
better results. The average ICSC test 
score ranged from 6% to 23% higher 
than the average test score on the four 
SDSs evaluated. This finding was 
considered by the authors to suggest 
that an improved format for SDSs may

serve to increase user comprehension of 
the information presented. 
OSHA believes that a standardized 
format would improve the effectiveness 
of SDSs. The primary basis for this 
belief is very simple: A consistent 
format would make it easier for users to 
find information on an SDS. Headings 
for SDS sections would be standardized, 
so SDS users would know which section 
to consult for the information they 
desire. The sections would be presented 
in a consistent, logical sequence to 
further facilitate locating information of 
interest. Information commonly desired 
by exposed employees and of greatest 
interest to emergency responders (e.g., 
Hazards Identification; First Aid 
Measures) would be presented in the 
beginning of the document for easy 
reference. More technical information 
(e.g., Stability and Reactivity; 
Toxicological Information) would be 
presented later. 
By segregating more complex 
information on an SDS from the 
information that is generally easier to 
understand, the standardized format 
included in the proposed rule has the 
potential to address many of the 
concerns that have been raised 
regarding the comprehensibility of 
information on SDSs. The standardized 
order of information will allow SDS 
users who desire only basic information 
about a hazardous chemical to find that 
information without having to sift 
through a great deal of technical 
information that may have little 
meaning to them. In emergency 
situations, rapid access to information 
such as first-aid measures, fire-fighting 
measures, and accidental release 
measures can be critically important. 
A standardized format does not 
address all issues affecting SDS 
comprehensibility. Reading level and 
some design elements would continue 
to vary. In many respects, this is 
inevitable given the different target 
audiences that SDSs have, and the 
varying qualifications of those who 
prepare SDSs. Nevertheless, OSHA 
believes that the proposed revisions will 
result in a substantial improvement in 
the quality and ease of comprehension 
of information provided on SDSs. 
In addition to the issues regarding 
comprehensibility, a number of 
researchers have raised concerns that 
some SDSs may be incomplete or 
contain erroneous information. The 
magnitude of the problem is unclear, 
because only very limited numbers of 
SDSs have been evaluated in these 
studies and in some cases the 
investigations were performed so long 
ago that the results may not reflect 
current practices. Nevertheless, the 
evidence appears to indicate that a 
substantial number of SDSs may not 
contain complete and correct 
information. 
An initial examination of the accuracy 
of SDSs was commissioned by OSHA 
shortly after the scope of the rule was 
expanded to cover all industries in 1987 
(Karstadt, 1988). The report, which 
analyzed the content of 196 SDSs for 
products used in auto repair and body 
shops, provided a general indication 
that the content and presentation of 
information was inconsistent on the 
SDSs examined. In 1991, OSHA 
commissioned an additional study that 
examined the accuracy of SDSs 
(Kearnet/Centaur, 1991). The study 
examined information presented in five 
areas considered crucial to the health of 
workers potentially exposed to 
hazardous substances. These five areas 
assessed were chemical identification of 
ingredients; reported health effects of 
ingredients; recommended first aid 
procedures; use of personal protective 
equipment; and exposure level 
regulations and guidelines. The 
evaluation indicated that 37% of the 
SDSs examined accurately identified 
health effects data, 76% provided 
complete and correct first aid 
procedures, 47% accurately identified 
proper personal protective equipment, 
and 47% correctly noted all relevant 
occupational exposure limits. Only 11% 
of the SDSs were accurate in all four 
information areas, but more (51%) were 
judged accurate, or considered to 
include both accurate and partially 
accurate information, than were judged 
inaccurate (10%). The study also 
concluded that the more recent SDSs 
examined (those prepared between 1988 
and 1990) appeared to be more accurate 
than those prepared earlier. 
This belief that some SDSs are not 
complete and correct was corroborated 
by an examination of SDSs for lead and 
ethylene glycol ethers (Paul and Kurtz, 
1994). Although these substances are 
known reproductive and developmental 
toxicants, researchers found that 421 of 
678 SDSs examined (62%) made no 
mention of effects on the reproductive 
system. OSHA also commissioned a 
study, completed in 1999, focusing 
specifically on the accuracy of first aid 
information provided on SDSs 
(Lexington Group, 1999). A total of 56 
SDSs for seven chemicals were 
examined. First aid information on the 
SDSs was compared with information 
from established references. The 
researchers reported that nearly all of 
the SDSs reviewed had at least minor 
inaccuracies. 
A standardized format does not 
directly address the concerns that have 
been raised regarding the accuracy of 
information present on SDSs. However, 
standardization would improve the 
accuracy of chemical hazard 
information indirectly. With consistent 
presentation of information, the task of 
reviewing SDSs and labels to assure 
accuracy would be simplified. 
Individuals preparing and reviewing 
these documents should find it easier to 
identify any missing elements, and 
compare information presented on an 
SDS to reference sources and other 
SDSs. OSHA enforcement personnel 
would be able to more efficiently 
examine SDSs when conducting 
inspections. The detailed entries 
proposed for the SDS are particularly 
noteworthy in this regard. The sub- 
headings would provide an organized 
and detailed list of pertinent 
information to be included under the 
headings on the SDS. For example, 
while the HCS currently requires 
physical and chemical characteristics of 
a hazardous chemical to be included on 
the SDS, the proposed rule would 
provide a list of 18 properties for 
Section 9 of the SDS. The party 
preparing the SDS would either include 
the relevant information for these 
entries, or indicate that the information 
is not available or not applicable. This 
approach would provide both a 
reminder to the party preparing the SDS 
regarding the information required, and 
a convenient means of reviewing the 
section to ensure that relevant 
information is included and is accurate. 
OSHA anticipates that the 
classification criteria included in the 
proposed rule would also improve the 
accuracy and precision of information 
on SDSs. The detailed criteria provided 
would direct evaluators to the 
appropriate classification for a 
chemical. For example, while directing 
the evaluator to use expert judgment in 
taking all existing hazard information 
into account, the criteria for serious eye 
damage/eye irritation is tied to specific 
results found in animal testing. In 
addition, assignment to hazard 
categories would lead to provision of 
detailed information that would be 
specific to the degree of hazard 
presented by the chemical. 
Classification of hazards would also 
play an important role in increasing the 
usefulness of SDSs under the proposed 
rule. By including the classification of 
the substance on the SDS, employers 
would be in a much better position to 
compare the hazards of different 
chemicals. Hazard categories generally 
give an indication of the severity of the 
hazard associated with a chemical. For 
example, all other things being equal, a 
chemical classified for skin corrosion/

irritation in category 1 as a skin 
corrosive would be more hazardous 
than a chemical classified in category 2 
as a skin irritant. If chemicals are 
classified into hazard categories, this 
information can be used to simplify the 
process of comparing chemicals. As 
noted previously, employers use SDSs 
as a means of comparing chemical 
hazards to select less hazardous 
alternatives. Thus it is reasonable to 
believe that the proposed rule would 
result in more effective use of the SDS 
as an instrument for identifying less 
hazardous substitutes for hazardous 
chemicals. 
Support for a standard SDS format has 
been expressed consistently by a variety 
of stakeholders for a long period of time. 
The development of an industry 
consensus standard for preparation of 
SDSs, ANSI Z400.1, in itself, shows a 
desire on the part of many parties for a 
consistent approach to SDSs. As noted 
previously, ANSI Z400.1 was updated 
in 2004 to include the same sections 
and sequence as the proposed rule. 
Responses to OSHA’s Request for 
Information in the Federal Register of 
May 17, 1990 (55 FR 20580) indicated 
widespread support for a standard SDS 
format, with many specifically 
supporting the ANSI format. 
In its report of its evaluation of the 
HCS, the GAO included several 
recommendations. Among these was a 
recommendation that OSHA clearly 
specify the language and presentation of 
information on SDSs (GAO, 1991). In 
addition, the report of the National 
Advisory Committee for Occupational 
Safety and Health Review of Hazard 
Communication (September 12, 1996) 
indicated that during the public 
presentations and workgroup 
discussions, there was general 
agreement that a uniform format should 
be encouraged and most workgroup 
members agreed that OSHA should 
endorse use of the ANSI Z400.1 format 
(NACOSH, 1996). 
Comments received in response to the 
ANPR also indicate widespread support 
for a standard format for SDS (e.g., 
Document ID #s 0054, 0064, 0030, 0124, 
and 0158). The American Foundry 
Society, for example, said that 
consistent SDSs make it easier for users 
to find information and compare 
products (Document ID #0158). The 
Jefferson County Local Emergency 
Planning Committee maintained that 
critical information can be missed by 
first responders due to the current lack 
of consistency in presentation of 
information on SDSs, stating: ‘‘It is not 
overreaching for us to say that lives will 
be saved through harmonization’’ 
(Document ID #0037). Based on the 
information in the record, OSHA thus 
believes not only that the proposed 
standardized SDS format would 
improve the quality of information 
provided on SDSs, but that stakeholders 
generally prefer a standardized format. 
Training 
Along with labels on containers and 
SDSs, employee training is one of three 
core components of a comprehensive 
hazard communication program. 
Training is needed to explain and 
reinforce the information presented on 
labels and SDSs, to ensure that 
employees understand the chemical 
hazards in their workplace and are 
aware of the protective measures to 
follow. The proposed rule includes a 
relatively minor revision to the HCS 
training requirements, intended to 
ensure that labels and SDSs are 
adequately explained to employees (see 
Section XV for a detailed discussion of 
the proposed requirements). In light of 
the evidence previously discussed 
relating to label and SDS 
comprehension, the importance of 
training should not be underestimated. 
Training is necessary to ensure that 
employees understand the standardized 
heading and sequence of information on 
SDSs. Likewise, employees must be able 
to understand the meaning of the 
proposed standardized label elements in 
order for them to be effective. In certain 
instances, label elements already appear 
to be fairly well understood. For 
example, ‘‘Danger’’ already appears to 
be generally recognized to represent a 
higher degree of hazard than 
‘‘Warning’’. Other label elements, 
particularly some pictograms, are less 
well understood. This finding is not 
surprising given the limited amount of 
exposure that most of the population 
has had to these pictograms. 
A relatively high level of 
understanding is generally 
recommended for pictograms. For 
example, ANSI Z535.3, the American 
National Standard that addresses 
criteria for safety symbols, contains a 
test method for determining the 
effectiveness of a pictogram. The 
criterion for success is 85% correct 
responses, with no more than 5% 
critical confusion. (Critical confusion 
refers to when the message conveyed is 
the opposite of the intended message.) 
A score below 85% does not mean the 
pictogram should not be used, but rather 
that it should not be used without some 
additional element, such as written text. 
The International Standards 
Organization has similar criteria in ISO 
9186, Procedures for the Development 
and Testing of Public Information 
Symbols. This standard recommends 
testing methodologies to evaluate 
symbols intended to be used 
internationally. It sets a somewhat lower 
level of acceptability (66%) than the 
ANSI standard. 
While initial understanding of some 
pictograms may not be satisfactory, 
research shows that training can 
improve comprehension. In one study, 
Wogalter et al. tested how well 
undergraduate subjects comprehended a 
set of 40 pharmaceutical and industrial 
safety pictorials before and after training 
(Wogalter et al., 1997c). Training led to 
a significant increase in pictorial 
comprehension. The improvement was 
greatest for the most complex symbols. 
Training was equally effective whether 
the subject was given a simple printed 
label (e.g., ‘‘Danger, cancer-causing 
substance’’) or a label with additional 
explanatory text. 
Lesch conducted a similar study, 
testing how well workers recognized a 
set of 31 chemical and physical safety 
symbols before and after training (Lesch, 
2002; 2003). Training significantly 
improved comprehension, which 
remained higher up to 8 weeks later. As 
in the Wogalter et al. study described 
above, Lesch found little difference in 
performance whether training took the 
form of a written label assigned to each 
symbol, a label plus explanatory text, or 
an accident scenario. Training also 
improved response speed. 
In a survey of South African workers, 
London examined the impact of brief 
training on the meaning of symbols and 
hazard phrases (London, 2003). Here, 
the author found no statistical 
difference in comprehensibility of four 
familiar hazard symbols, but did find 
that training improved comprehension 
of one symbol (the proposed health 
hazard symbol), and it also reduced the 
overall incidence of critical confusion. 
This study also found that workers with 
previous workplace training were more 
likely to understand label text and some 
pictograms, and were better able to 
identify the active ingredient. A similar 
result was reported by Banda and 
Sichilongo in their evaluation of GHS 
labels in Zambia. The authors found 
that ‘‘correct responses to label elements 
were not a result of social class and/or 
age but appeared to be influenced by 
extent of duration of exposure either 
through specialized training or 
acquaintance’’ (Banda and Sichilongo, 
2006). Recognizing that symbols are the 
items most often recalled from a label, 
London advised a strong emphasis on 
training for GHS symbols, particularly 
the ‘‘flame over circle’’ and ‘‘flame’’ 
symbols—which were reported to be 
easily confused—and symbols that may

generate critical confusion (London, 
2003). 
These reports serve to reinforce 
OSHA’s longstanding belief that labels, 
SDSs, and training are complementary 
parts of a comprehensive hazard 
communication program—each element 
reinforces the knowledge necessary for 
effective protection of employees. The 
need for training to ensure 
comprehension of hazard information is 
widely recognized. Annex A of ANSI 
Z535.2 (the American National Standard 
for Environmental and Facility Safety 
Signs), for example, recommends 
training on the meaning of standard 
safety symbols and signal words, and 
ANSI Z535.4 contains similar guidance. 
It is a longstanding Agency position 
that employees have the ‘‘right to know’’ 
and understand the hazards of 
chemicals they are exposed to in the 
workplace (FR 53:29826; FR 59:6126). 
This knowledge is needed in order to 
take the precautions necessary for safe 
handling and use, to recognize adverse 
health effects associated with chemical 
exposure, and to respond appropriately 
in emergency situations. 
Equally important in terms of 
employee protection is that employers 
have access to chemical hazard 
information as well. Chemical 
information is the foundation of 
workplace chemical safety programs— 
without it, sound management of 
chemicals cannot occur. By ensuring 
that emergency responders, physicians, 
nurses, industrial hygienists, safety 
engineers and other professionals have 
the information they need to devise 
protections, the HCS serves to reduce 
the likelihood of chemical source 
illnesses and injuries. Selection of 
appropriate engineering controls, work 
practices, and personal protective 
equipment is predicated knowing the 
chemicals that are present, the form 
they are present in, and their hazardous 
properties. 
OSHA believes that the proposed 
requirements would improve the quality 
and consistency of the chemical hazard 
information provided to employers and 
employees. A combination of label 
elements—signal word, hazard 
statement(s), pictogram(s), and 
precautionary statement(s)—is expected 
to make label warnings more noticeable, 
easier to understand, and better 
communicate hazard and precautionary 
information. Standardized headings and 
a consistent order of information are 
anticipated to make it easier for users to 
find information on SDSs, improve their 
accuracy, and better enable users to 
compare the relative hazards of different 
substances. Along with effective 
training in the context of a 
comprehensive chemical hazard 
communication program, these 
revisions would serve to more 
adequately inform employees of 
chemical hazards, and lead to better 
protections in the workplace. 
OSHA’s preliminary determination to 
modify the HCS is based on its 
assessment of the potential to improve 
employee safety and health. While 
enhancing protection of employees is 
the Agency’s objective in this 
rulemaking, implementation of the GHS 
is also anticipated to provide other 
benefits. As indicated in Section IV, 
modification of the HCS is expected to 
promote a range of objectives. 
Many countries do not currently have 
regulatory requirements addressing 
chemical hazard communication. Those 
countries that do not have the resources 
to develop a regulatory system can use 
the GHS as a basis for establishing such 
requirements. Implementation in these 
countries will thus lead to 
dissemination of information about 
chemical hazards and protective 
measures to individuals who would not 
otherwise be afforded this benefit. 
Transmittal of information provides a 
basis for the sound management of 
chemicals, which is beneficial not only 
to the country where it is practiced, but 
to neighboring countries as well. For 
example, uncontrolled releases of 
hazardous chemicals are not confined 
by national borders. A coordinated and 
harmonized approach to developing and 
providing chemical hazard information 
is beneficial to all. 
The United Nations Institute for 
Training and Research (UNITAR) and 
the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) have initiated a program to 
support GHS implementation. The 
program provides assistance regarding 
development of national GHS 
implementation strategies, legislation, 
and other topics. UNITAR is supporting 
national GHS implementation and 
capacity building projects in Cambodia, 
Indonesia, Laos, Nigeria, Senegal, 
Slovenia, Thailand, the Gambia, and the 
Philippines, and has supported 
meetings, workshops, and regional 
activities as well. Over 80 countries 
have requested assistance from 
UNITAR/ILO, indicating widespread 
interest in GHS adoption throughout the 
world. 
Adoption of the GHS is also expected 
to reduce the amount of testing 
performed to identify hazardous 
properties of chemicals. The HCS does 
not currently require testing of 
chemicals, and will not require testing 
with adoption of the GHS. However, 
testing is often performed to determine 
how a chemical will be classified under 
the various systems currently in place. 
By harmonizing definitions of hazards, 
such testing would be minimized, 
saving unnecessary use of test animals 
and associated costs. 
Implementation of the GHS is 
expected to lessen the regulatory burden 
associated with classification of 
chemical hazards and labeling of 
hazardous chemicals. In the U.S., 
regulatory authorities with jurisdiction 
over the workplace, environment, 
consumer and transport sectors (i.e., 
OSHA, EPA, CPSC, and DOT) are not 
currently harmonized with regard to 
definitions of hazards and other 
requirements related to classification 
and labeling of chemicals. Widespread 
adoption of the GHS among the agencies 
would simplify the process of 
classifying chemicals and developing 
labels. For example, most chemicals are 
produced in a workplace and shipped 
elsewhere. As a result, manufacturers 
must comply with at least two sets of 
requirements that are currently not 
harmonized. Adoption of the GHS 
would simplify this process. Thus every 
chemical manufacturer would be likely 
to experience some benefits from 
harmonization, even if they are not 
involved in international trade. 
For those who are involved in 
international trade in hazardous 
chemicals, the expected benefits would 
be even greater. As discussed in Section 
III, different countries have established 
requirements for chemical hazard 
classification, labeling, and SDSs that 
vary with regard to the scope of 
chemicals covered, definitions of 
hazards, the specificity of requirements, 
and the use of symbols and pictograms. 
Tracking the requirements of different 
regulatory authorities and developing 
different labels and SDSs is a burden for 
all manufacturers, importers, 
distributors, and transporters. Chemical 
manufacturers that do not have the 
resources to identify and comply with 
the requirements of regulatory 
authorities in different countries are 
precluded from engaging in trade with 
those countries. Small businesses are 
particularly affected. Implementation of 
the GHS would alleviate this burden 
and simplify the provision of chemical 
hazard information in international 
commerce. 
VI. Pertinent Legal Authority 
The primary purpose of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act (the 
‘‘OSH Act’’ or ‘‘Act’’) (29 U.S.C. 651 et 
seq.) is to assure, so far as possible, safe 
and healthful working conditions for 
every American employee over the 
period of his or her working lifetime. 
One means prescribed by the Congress

to achieve this goal is the mandate given 
to, and the authority vested in, the 
Secretary of Labor to ‘‘promulgate, 
modify, or revoke’’ mandatory 
occupational safety and health 
standards. OSH Act § 6(b), 29 U.S.C. 
655(b). 
An occupational safety and health 
standard is defined under the Act as: 
[A] standard which requires conditions, or 
the adoption or use of one or more practices, 
means, methods, operations, or processes, 
reasonably necessary or appropriate to 
provide a safe or healthful employment and 
places of employment. 
OSH Act § 3(8), 29 U.S.C. 652(8). The 
Supreme Court has interpreted this 
provision as requiring OSHA to 
determine, before promulgating a 
permanent standard under section 6(b) 
of the Act, that the standard is 
reasonably necessary and appropriate to 
remedy a significant risk of material 
health impairment. Industrial Union 
Dep’t v. American Petroleum Institute, 
448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (‘‘Benzene’’). 
This ‘‘significant risk’’ determination 
constitutes a finding that, absent the 
change in practices mandated by the 
standard, the workplaces in question 
would be ‘‘unsafe’’ in the sense that 
employees would be threatened with a 
significant risk of harm. Id. 
OSHA’s Hazard Communication 
Standard (‘‘HCS’’) is a health standard 
promulgated under the authority of 
sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(7) of the Act. 
Associated Builders & Contractors, Inc. 
v. Brock, 862 F.2d 63, 67–68 (3d Cir. 
1988); United Steelworkers of America 
v. Auchter, 763 F.2d 728, 738 (3d Cir. 
1985); United Steelworkers of America 
v. Auchter, 819 F.2d 1263, 1267 (3d Cir. 
1987). Authority for the HCS may also 
be found in section 8(c) and 8(g) of the 
Act. Section 8(c)(1) of the Act empowers 
the Secretary to require employers to 
make, keep, and preserve records 
regarding activities related to the Act 
and to make such records available to 
the Secretary. 29 U.S.C. 657(c)(1). 
Section 8(g)(2) of the Act empowers the 
Secretary to ‘‘prescribe such rules and 
regulations as (she) may deem necessary 
to carry out (her) responsibilities under 
this Act * * *’’ 29 U.S.C. 657(g)(2). 
Section 6(b)(5) provides that: 
The Secretary, in promulgating standards 
dealing with toxic materials, or harmful 
physical agents under this subsection, shall 
set the standard which most adequately 
assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of 
the best available evidence, that no employee 
will suffer material impairment of health or 
functional capacity even if such employee 
has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with 
by such standard for the period of his 
working life. Development of standards 
under this subsection shall be based upon 
research, demonstrations, experiments, and 
such other information as may be 
appropriate. In addition to the attainment of 
the highest degree of health and safety 
protection for the employee, other 
considerations shall be the latest available 
scientific data in the field, the feasibility of 
standards, and experience gained under this 
and other health and safety laws. Whenever 
practicable, the standard promulgated shall 
be expressed in terms of objective criteria 
and of the performance desired. 
29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5). Thus, once OSHA 
determines that a significant risk due to 
a health hazard is present and that such 
risk can be reduced or eliminated by a 
proposed standard, section 6(b)(5) 
requires it to issue the standard, based 
on the best available evidence, that 
‘‘most adequately assures’’ employee 
protection, subject only to feasibility 
considerations. As the Supreme Court 
has explained, in passing section 
6(b)(5), ‘‘Congress * * * place[d] 
worker health above all other 
considerations save those making 
attainment of this benefit 
unachievable.’’ American Textile 
Manufacturers Institute, Inc. v. 
Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 509 (1981) 
(‘‘Cotton Dust’’). Where, however, 
OSHA is confronted with two feasible 
methods of reducing risk to the 
appropriate level, OSHA must chose the 
cheaper method. Id. at 513 n.32; 
International Union, UAW v. OSHA, 37 
F.3d 665, 668 (D.C. Cir. 1994). 
In addition, section 6(b)(7) of the Act 
provides in part that: 
Any standard promulgated under this 
subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or 
other appropriate forms of warning as are 
necessary to insure that employees are 
apprised of all hazards to which they are 
exposed, relevant symptoms and appropriate 
medical treatment, and proper conditions 
and precautions of safe use or exposure. 
29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7). Section 6(b)(7)’s 
labeling and employee warning 
requirements provide basic protections 
for employees in the absence of specific 
permissible exposure limits, particularly 
by providing employers and employees 
with information necessary to design 
work processes that protect employees 
against exposure to hazardous 
chemicals in the first instance. The 
Supreme Court has recognized such 
protective measures may be imposed in 
workplaces where chemical exposure 
levels are below that for which OSHA 
has found a significant risk. Benzene, 
448 U.S. at 657–58 & n.66. In Benzene, 
the Court relied on § 6(b)(7) to uphold 
the imposition of exposure and medical 
monitoring requirements at exposures to 
benzene below the permissible exposure 
limit. Id. These requirements serve as a 
‘‘backstop,’’ the Court said, allowing 
OSHA to check the validity of its 
assumptions in developing the PEL and 
employers to remove workers before 
they suffered any permanent damage. 
Id. at 657–58. 
In making the determinations 
required by the Act, OSHA’s 
conclusions must be ‘‘supported by 
substantial evidence in the record 
considered as a whole.’’ OSH Act § 6(f), 
29 U.S.C. 655(f). OSHA must use the 
‘‘best available evidence,’’ which 
includes ‘‘the latest scientific data in the 
field’’; ‘‘research, demonstrations, 
experiments, and such other 
information as may be appropriate’’; and 
‘‘experience gained under this and other 
health and safety laws.’’ OSH Act 
§ 6(b)(5), 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5). The 
Supreme Court has held that OSHA is 
not required to support its finding of 
significant risk ‘‘with anything 
approaching scientific certainty,’’ and 
that the determination of whether a 
particular risk is ‘‘ ‘significant’ will be 
based largely on policy considerations.’’ 
Benzene, 448 U.S. at 655–56 & n.62. 
The OSH Act allows the Secretary to 
‘‘modify’’ and ‘‘revoke’’ existing 
occupational safety or health standards. 
OSH Act § 6(b), 29 U.S.C. 655(b). In 
passing the Act, Congress recognized 
that OSHA should revise and replace its 
standards as ‘‘new knowledge and 
techniques are developed.’’ S. Rep. 91– 
1282 at 6 (1970). The Supreme Court 
has observed that administrative 
agencies ‘‘do not establish rules of 
conduct to last forever, and * * * must 
be given ample latitude to adapt their 
rules and policies to the demands of 
changing circumstances.’’ Motor Vehicle 
Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. 
Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42 
(1983) (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted). 
A. Significant Risk. Most OSHA 
health standards protect employees by 
imposing requirements when employees 
are exposed to a concentration of a 
hazardous substance that OSHA has 
found to create a significant risk of 
material health impairment. Thus, in 
making the significant risk 
determination in these cases, OSHA is 
concerned with measuring the exposure 
an employee may be expected to incur 
when dealing with these substances to 
determine the level at which a 
significant risk arises. 
OSHA took a different approach to its 
significant risk determinations in 
promulgating the HCS in 1983 and 
revising it in 1994. Rather than 
attempting to assess the exposure—and 
therefore the risk—associated with the 
use of each hazardous chemical in each 
industry to determine if that chemical 
posed a significant risk in that industry,

50305 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
OSHA took a more general approach. It 
relied on NIOSH data showing that 
about 25 million or about 25% of 
American employees were potentially 
exposed to one or more of 8,000 NIOSH- 
identified chemical hazards and that for 
the years 1977 and 1978, more than 
174,000 illnesses were likely caused by 
exposure to hazardous chemicals. 48 FR 
53282. It then noted the consensus 
evident in the record among labor, 
industry, health professionals, and 
government that an ‘‘effective federal 
standard requiring employers to identify 
workplace hazards, communicate 
hazard information to employees, and 
train employees in recognizing and 
avoiding those hazards’’ was necessary 
to protect employee health. 48 FR 
53283. 
Thus, OSHA found that because 
inadequate communication about serious 
chemical hazards endangers workers and that 
the practices required by this standard are 
necessary or appropriate to the elimination or 
mitigation of these hazards, the Secretary is 
hereby able to make the threshold 
‘‘significant risk’’ determination that is an 
essential attribute of all permanent standards. 
48 FR 53321. The U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Third Circuit has on several 
occasions upheld this determination of 
significant risk as sufficient to justify 
the HCS under OSH Act § 6(b). See 
Associated Builders & Contractors, 862 
F.2d at 67 (discussing the history of its 
review of the issue). 
A characteristic of hazard 
communication that OSHA confronted 
in adopting the HCS is that information 
about the hazards associated with a 
particular chemical, and the exposures 
associated with its use, are not 
uniformly distributed across industry. 
That is, chemical manufacturers and 
importers tend to have greater 
knowledge and scientific expertise with 
respect to the composition of the 
chemicals they make or import. See 48 
FR 53306, 53322. Therefore, they are 
usually in the best position to assess the 
inherent hazards associated with them. 
Id. However, it is the downstream users 
and their employees who tend to have 
the best information about the means 
and methods of exposure, and are 
therefore usually in the best position to 
determine the risk arising from the use 
of the chemical in their workplaces. See 
48 FR 53295–96, 53307; 59 FR 6132. 
OSHA’s approach in promulgating the 
HCS reflects this reality. It places the 
duty to ascertain and disclose chemical 
hazards on manufacturers and 
importers, so that downstream users can 
use this information to avoid harmful 
exposures to chemical hazards. But 
because manufacturers and importers 
will often have less information about 
the particular exposures of downstream 
users, their hazard assessment and 
communication obligations are imposed 
only for all normal conditions of use of 
their chemicals and foreseeable 
emergencies associated with those 
chemicals. 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(2). 
In previous rulemakings, OSHA 
rejected suggestions that these 
obligations should arise only where the 
downstream use creates a significant 
risk because it is difficult, if not 
impossible, for OSHA or manufacturers 
and importers to know where these risks 
might occur before the fact. 49 FR 
53295–96; 59 FR 6132. Further, it is 
only by the provision of hazard 
information that downstream employers 
and employees can determine how to 
use the chemical so that exposure and 
risk may be minimized. Id. Thus, the 
HCS protects employees from 
significant risk by requiring 
communications about all chemicals 
that may present a hazard to employees, 
regardless of the exposure or risk levels 
any particular downstream user might 
actually experience. Durez Div. of 
Occidental Chemical Corp v. OSHA, 906 
F.2d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 1990); General 
Carbon Co. v. OSHRC, 860 F.2d 479, 
485 (D.C. Cir. 1988). 
For these reasons, hazard 
communication—as opposed to risk 
communication—‘‘most adequately 
assures’’ employee protection from the 
significant risk of material impairment 
of health arising from the use of 
hazardous chemicals in the workplace 
for purposes of OSHA’s authority under 
section 6(b)(5) of the Act. In addition, 
HCS is authorized under section 6(b)(7), 
which requires OSHA to prescribe 
‘‘labels or other appropriate forms of 
warning as are necessary to insure that 
employees are apprised of all hazards to 
which they are exposed, relevant 
symptoms and appropriate emergency 
treatment, and proper conditions and 
precautions of safe use or exposure.’’ As 
noted above, the Benzene case 
recognizes that the ‘‘backstop’’ 
provisions of section 6(b)(7) allow 
OSHA to impose information 
requirements even before the employee 
is exposed to the significant risk. In this 
way, the HCS assures that employers 
and employees have the information 
they need to avoid situations of 
exposure in the work place even before 
the employee is exposed to a hazardous 
chemical. 
The current proposal makes no 
conceptual or theoretical change in this 
approach. It still imposes the same 
general requirements: Hazard 
identification, labeling, safety data 
sheets, a written hazard communication 
program, and employee training. 
OSHA’s determination that inadequate 
communication about hazardous 
chemicals constitutes a significant risk 
supports the incorporation of the GHS 
into the HCS, just as it supported the 
promulgation of the original HCS and its 
subsequent modifications. Further, the 
data discussed in parts V and VII of this 
preamble show that the significant risk 
continues to exist even under the 
current standard. OSHA estimates that 
over 40 million employees are 
potentially exposed to hazardous 
chemicals. BLS data show that in 2007, 
there were approximately 54,000 
illnesses related to hazardous chemical 
exposure and 125 chemically-related 
fatalities. These new statistics probably 
represent only a small portion of the 
illnesses experienced by exposed 
employees because many illnesses are 
not reported as being related to 
workplace exposures, due to long 
latency periods, and other factors. For 
all the reasons detailed in Section V, the 
agency believes that adoption of the 
GHS will improve communication of 
the hazards associated with the use of 
chemicals, and reduce significant risk. 
B. Section 6(b)(7) Authority. With 
respect to labels and employee 
warnings, the last sentence of section 
6(b)(7) provides that: 
The Secretary, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
may by rule promulgated pursuant to section 
553 of title 4, United States Code, make 
appropriate modifications in the foregoing 
requirements relating to the use of labels or 
other forms of warning, monitoring or 
measuring, and medical examinations as may 
be warranted by experience, information, or 
medical or technological developments 
acquired subsequent to the promulgation of 
the relevant standard. 
29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7). 
OSHA has used the authority of 
section 6(b)(7) in the past to revise its 
standards. See, e.g., Standards 
Improvement Project—Phase II, 70 FR 
1112 (January 5, 2005); Standards 
Improvement (Miscellaneous Changes) 
for General Industry and Construction 
Standards, 63 FR 33450, 33458 (June 18, 
1998). For example, it used this 
authority to revise the inorganic arsenic 
and coke oven emissions standards to 
eliminate the requirement of sputum 
cytology testing and to reduce the 
required frequency of mandatory chest 
x-rays from semi-annual to annual. 63 
FR 33458. OSHA justified these changes 
on the grounds that studies reported 
after the promulgation of the relevant 
standards showed that sputum-cytology 
did not improve employee survival rates 
and the survival rates for semi-annual x- 
rays were not higher than annual exams. 
63 FR 33458–59. In addition, OSHA has

used its section 6(b)(7) authority to 
authorize new respirator fit protocols 
under its respiratory protection 
standard. 69 FR 46986 (August 4, 2004); 
see generally 29 CFR 1910.134 App. A, 
Pt. II. 
OSHA’s proposal to revise the HCS 
fits well within the authority granted by 
the last sentence of § 6(b)(7). Adoption 
of GHS provisions would constitute a 
‘‘modification[]’’ of the HCS regarding 
‘‘the use of labels or other forms of 
employee warning.’’ For the reasons 
summarized above and explained more 
fully elsewhere in this preamble, OSHA 
believes that the adoption of GHS to be 
‘‘appropriate’’ based on ‘‘experience, 
information, or medical or technological 
developments acquired subsequent to 
the promulgation of the relevant 
standard.’’ The formulation of GHS may 
also be considered a ‘‘technological 
development’’ that has occurred since 
the promulgation of the original 
standard in 1983. GHS was negotiated 
and drafted through the involvement of 
labor, industry, and governmental 
agencies, and thus represents the 
collective experience and information 
on hazard communication gathered by 
the participants in these sectors over the 
last several decades. See Part III above 
and 71 FR 53618–19. Indeed, OSHA 
noted the possibility of a future 
internationally harmonized standard in 
the preamble accompanying the original 
rule. 48 FR 53287. 
The last sentence of section 6(b)(7) 
also requires consultation with the 
Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. OSHA briefed NIOSH on this 
proposal as a part of the October 2008 
OSHA–NIOSH Issues Exchange 
meeting, which was attended by 
NIOSH’s Acting Director, and NIOSH 
expressed its support. OSHA has also 
briefed NIOSH on the GHS in previous 
Issues Exchange meetings. In addition, 
NIOSH has actively supported the GHS 
during its development and has been 
involved in the development of control 
banding, international chemical safety 
cards, and employee training for the 
GHS. NIOSH has submitted a comment 
supporting OSHA’s proposal, (Ex. 2–46– 
1), and reviewed a draft of both this 
NPRM and the ANPR before it was 
published. NIOSH has stated that it 
supports OSHA in its proposal to update the 
HCS and to address the changes in hazard 
criteria, to include all 16 physical hazard 
criteria, and to adopt the specific labeling 
requirements and the safety data sheet (SDS) 
order of information in the Globally 
Harmonized System of Classification and 
Labelling of Chemicals. 
(Document ID # 0082) These 
consultations coupled with OSHA’s on- 
going relationship with NIOSH are more 
than sufficient to satisfy the 
requirement. For all the reasons set forth 
above, revision of the HCS through 
adoption of the GHS as proposed by 
OSHA is authorized by section 6(b)(7) of 
the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7). 
C. Section 6(b)(5) Authority. OSHA 
also has authority to adopt the proposal 
under section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 
U.S.C. § 655(b)(5). As noted above, 
section 6(b) explicitly allows OSHA to 
‘‘modify’’ standards, and adoption of the 
GHS is justified because it ‘‘most 
adequately assures’’ employee 
protection for purposes of section 
6(b)(5) for the reasons detailed in part V 
of this preamble. Section 6(b)(5) also 
requires a finding that the proposed 
standard is feasible, which means 
‘‘capable of being done, executed or 
effected.’’ Cotton Dust, 452 U.S. at 508– 
09. 
Feasibility has two aspects, economic 
and technological. United Steelworkers 
of America v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 
1264 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (‘‘Lead I’’). A 
standard is technologically feasible if 
the protective measures it requires 
already exist, can be brought into 
existence with available technology, or 
can be created with technology that can 
reasonably be expected to be developed. 
See Lead I, 647 F.2d at 1272. A standard 
is economically feasible if industry can 
absorb or pass on the cost of compliance 
without threatening its longer term 
profitability or competitive structure. 
See Cotton Dust, 452 U.S. at 530 n.55; 
Lead I, 647 F.2d at 1265. 
In addressing feasibility in the 1994 
HCS revisions, OSHA found that: 
The feasibility question raised by the HCS 
is not difficult to resolve. This standard does 
not relate to activities on the frontiers of 
scientific knowledge; the requirements are 
not the sorts of obligations that approach the 
limits of feasibility. Associated Builders & 
Contractors, 862 F.2d at 68. The record on 
which the original and expanded HCS’s were 
based did not contain credible evidence that 
the HCS would be technologically or 
economically infeasible for any industrial 
sector, id., and there was substantial 
evidence of feasibility, 52 FR 31855–58. 
59 FR 6133. OSHA has repeatedly found 
that the requirements of the HCS are 
technologically feasible. See 52 FR 
31855–57; 59 FR 6133. While the GHS 
modifications to HCS impose more 
specific requirements for hazard 
classification, labeling, and safety data 
sheets, employers may use the same 
methods to meet these requirements as 
they are already utilizing to comply 
with the requirements of HCS. 
The most important resource 
employers will need to comply with the 
GHS modifications to HCS is technical 
expertise in hazard classification and 
the communication of those hazards. 
OSHA found that such expertise was 
already available in promulgating the 
initial HCS rule in 1983. 48 FR 53296– 
99. OSHA believes that the availability 
of professionals with this expertise has 
only increased in the intervening time. 
At least one professional organization 
provides training in hazard 
communication to professionals and 
businesses. (Document ID #s 0021 and 
0145.) Through OSHA’s Alliance with 
the Society for Chemical Hazard 
Communication, training to small 
businesses in the requirements of 
hazard communication and information 
about the GHS modifications has been 
made available. See http:// 
www.osha.gov/dcsp/alliances/schc/ 
schc.html. NIOSH is preparing a 
program for employers to use in training 
their employees in the new labeling 
scheme. (Document ID # 0082.) OSHA 
received numerous comments in 
response to its September 12, 2006 
ANPR discussing the professionals and 
tools (both manual and electronic) that 
employers have available to comply 
with current hazard communication 
requirements. (See, e.g., Document ID #s 
0042, 0046, 0050, 0053, 0072, 0077, 
0015, 0024, 0026, 0036, 0038, 0107, 
0108, 0116, 0123, 0128, 0141, 0144, 
0145, 0154, 0155, and 0163.) The 
Agency has been engaged on several 
fronts to facilitate the transition from 
the current standard to the GHS 
modifications, if ultimately adopted. For 
instance, the United Nations Institute 
for Training and Research (UNITAR) is 
developing basic and more advanced 
training courses for the GHS, and OSHA 
has been involved with and committed 
resources to this effort. NIOSH’s 
comment also discussed the 
development of the WHO/IPCS 
International Chemical Safety Cards, 
which includes the GHS pictograms and 
signal words. (Document ID # 0082.) 
OSHA believes that adopting the GHS 
modifications as proposed poses no 
technological feasibility issues. 
Likewise, for the reasons more fully 
discussed in the Preliminary Regulatory 
Analysis, OSHA believes that there is 
nothing about the adoption of GHS that 
will pose economic feasibility issues. 
Again, OSHA has found that the 
implementation of HCS in the first 
instance would have no such effect. See 
52 FR 31855–57; 59 FR 6133. Most 
commenters agreed that, once 
conversion to the new system is 
completed, compliance with the GHS- 
modified HCS will not be more 
expensive than compliance with the 
current HCS. (Document ID #s 0046, 
0047, 0080, 0103, 0104, 0105, 0179,

50307 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
1 A more recent study prepared by the University 
of California Centers for Occupational and 
Environmental Health, and commissioned by the 
California Environmental Protection Agency, 
suggests that fatalities from chronic illnesses remain 
an important problem (University of California 
COEH, 2008, p. 18). That study estimated that, in 
2004, more than 200,000 workers, in California 
alone, were diagnosed with serious chronic diseases 
(encompassing cancer, COPD, asthma, 
pneumoconiosis, chronic renal failure, and 
Parkinson’s disease) attributable to chemical 
exposures in the workplace, and that an additional 
4,400 workers in California died during that year 
from chemical exposures in the workplace. 
Underlying studies are to appear in forthcoming 
publications. 
0119, 0123, 0129, 0135, 0139, 0145, 
0147, and 0163.) While industry will 
incur the cost of converting to the new 
system, OSHA does not believe that this 
cost is so substantial as to threaten long 
term profitability or the competitive 
structure of any industry. 
Finally, OSHA is not proposing to 
‘‘delegate[e] power to an international 
body’’ through the adoption of the GHS 
or justifying this proposal as a means to 
reduce ‘‘potential barriers to 
international trade,’’ as suggested in the 
comments. (Document ID #s 0065 and 
0026). OSHA recognizes, however, that 
there are potential benefits to 
international trade by adopting the GHS, 
and these are discussed in section VII of 
this preamble, OSHA is proposing to 
comply with the OSH Act’s mandate to 
assure as far as possible safe and 
healthful working conditions in this 
country by incorporating the GHS’s 
improved hazard communications 
requirements into the HCS through the 
process authorized by section 6 of the 
OSH Act. Adoption of the GHS 
modifications into the HCS would not 
place any new obligations on OSHA to 
comply with the requirements of any 
foreign or international body. 
VII. Preliminary Economic Analysis 
and Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Screening Analysis 
A. Introduction and Summary 
Introduction 
OSHA is required by the 
Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) 
Act of 1970 to ensure and demonstrate 
that standards promulgated under the 
Act are reasonably necessary and 
appropriate, as well as technologically 
and economically feasible. Executive 
Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, and the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act also require OSHA to 
estimate the costs, assess the benefits, 
and analyze the impacts of certain rules 
that the Agency promulgates. 
Accordingly, OSHA has prepared this 
Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA), 
including an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Screening Analysis (IRFSA), 
for the proposed modifications to the 
Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). 
The OSHA PEA is based largely on 
research conducted for this purpose by 
Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, Inc. 
(PP&E), as presented in their report, 
‘‘Data and Analysis in Support of an 
Economic Analysis of Proposed Changes 
to the OSHA Hazard Communication 
Standard,’’ prepared under contract to 
OSHA. The PP&E report is available in 
the public docket for this rulemaking, 
OSHA–H022K–2006–0062, through 
www.regulations.gov. 
Need for Regulation 
Employees in work environments 
covered by the HCS are exposed to a 
variety of significant hazards that can 
and do cause serious injury and death. 
The HCS serves to assure that both 
employers and employees are provided 
needed information about chemical 
hazards that was not provided by 
markets in the absence of such a 
standard. The HCS also facilitates 
interstate commerce by promoting 
consistency among Federal and 
individual State requirements. 
The proposed changes would create a 
uniformity standard for the presentation 
of risk information and, as such, would 
serve to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the existing hazard 
communication system in the U.S., and 
to reduce unnecessary barriers to trade. 
Hazard communication is currently 
addressed by many different 
international, national, and State 
authorities. As described in Section V of 
the preamble, these existing 
requirements are not always consistent 
and often contain different definitions 
of hazards and varying provisions for 
what information is required on labels 
and safety data sheets. Complying with 
these different rules results in increased 
costs for employers with hazardous 
chemicals in their workplace and for 
chemical manufacturers, distributors, 
and transporters involved in 
international trade. In addition to these 
effects on businesses, the different 
existing requirements result in 
workplaces receiving chemicals with 
varying information, with potential 
adverse impacts on the safety and health 
of employees. The proposed revisions to 
the OSHA HCS would standardize the 
hazard communication requirements for 
products used in U.S. workplaces, and 
thus provide employees with uniform 
and consistent hazard communication 
information. Secondarily, because these 
proposed revisions would harmonize 
the U.S. system with international 
norms, they would facilitate 
international trade. 
Affected Industries 
The proposal would affect employers 
and employees in many different 
industries across the economy. Based on 
the PP&E report, OSHA estimates in 
Table VII–2 that the HCS covers over 
five million workplaces in which 
employees are potentially exposed to 
hazardous chemicals. 
For establishments with employees 
whose exposures to hazardous 
chemicals results from their use of the 
chemical products, the proposed 
revisions to the HCS would generally 
involve minor effects, such as 
familiarization with new warning labels. 
For establishments producing hazardous 
chemicals, which are generally part of 
the chemical manufacturing industry, 
the revisions to the standard would 
involve reclassifying chemicals in 
accordance with the new classification 
system and revising safety data sheets 
(SDSs) and labels associated with 
hazardous chemicals. OSHA has 
preliminarily judged that SDSs for 
imported chemicals would normally be 
produced in the country of origin, and 
thus would not represent expenses for 
importers. OSHA welcomes comment 
on this judgment. 
Benefits, Net Benefits, and Cost- 
Effectiveness 
There is ample evidence of the 
substantial risks of chemical exposure 
in the workplace. In 2007, according to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
employees suffered an estimated 55,400 
illnesses attributable to chemical 
exposures (BLS, 2008), and some 17,340 
chemical-source injuries and illnesses 
involved days away from work (BLS, 
2009). However, as noted in the 
preamble to the HCS in 1983, BLS 
estimates probably only reflect a small 
percentage of occupational illnesses (48 
FR 53284) because most occupational 
illnesses are not reported. The principal 
reasons are that they are not recognized 
as being related to workplace exposures 
and are subject to long latency periods 
between exposure and the manifestation 
of disease. The key study of the issue of 
the number of fatalities from chronic 
illnesses, not recorded in any way by 
BLS, is Leigh et al., 1997. That study 
found that in 1992, there were from 
46,900 to 73,700 fatalities from chronic 
illnesses related to occupational 
exposures to chemicals. This critical 
category dwarfs all acute injuries and 
illnesses due to chemicals recorded by 
BLS.1 
Section V of the preamble describes 
some of the incidents that may have 
been related to the non-standardized 
approach to SDSs in the current HCS,

including xylene exposure at a hospital 
when an employee was unable to find 
critical information on an SDS in an 
emergency spill situation (Hanson, 
2004). As a result, twelve employees 
required emergency room treatment. 
Another example is the explosion at a 
manufacturing plant in Corbin, KY, 
which resulted in the death of 7 workers 
and injuries to another 37 workers. A 
Federal investigation into the explosion 
concluded that the cause was the 
inability to effectively identify and 
respond to the inherent explosive 
hazards of phenolic resin and 
specifically referenced the MSDS for 
phenolic resin dust (U.S. Chemical 
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, 
February 2005). Were the information 
on SDSs more uniformly formatted and 
comprehensible, as required under the 
proposed modifications to HCS, 
incidents such as those described above 
would be less likely to occur. 
In general, the proposed 
modifications to the HCS are expected 
to result in increased safety and health 
for the affected employees and to reduce 
the numbers of accidents, fatalities, 
injuries, and illnesses associated with 
exposures to hazardous chemicals. 
It is difficult to quantify precisely 
how many injuries, illnesses, and 
fatalities would be prevented due to the 
proposed revisions to the HCS. The 
benefits associated with the existing 
HCS may indirectly help provide a 
general sense of the potential magnitude 
of the benefits of the proposed revisions 
to the HCS. OSHA preliminarily 
estimates that if the proposed rule could 
capture one percent of the benefits 
estimated for the original 1983 and 1987 
HCS rules, the proposed revisions 
would result in the prevention of 318 
non-lost-workday injuries and illnesses, 
203 lost-workday injuries and illnesses, 
64 chronic illnesses, and 43 fatalities 
annually. The monetized value of the 
corresponding reduction in 
occupational risks among the affected 
employees is an estimated $266 million 
on an annualized basis. 
The harmonization of hazard 
classifications, safety data sheet formats, 
and warning labels for affected 
chemicals and products would also 
involve substantial savings to 
businesses. Fewer different SDSs would 
have to be produced for affected 
chemicals, and many SDSs would be 
able to be produced at lower cost due 
to harmonization and standardization. 
The benefits represented by these cost 
reductions would primarily affect 
businesses involved in chemical 
manufacturing. In addition, businesses 
that purchase or use hazardous 
chemicals can expect reductions in 
operating costs as a result of the 
promulgation and implementation of 
the proposed modifications. 
PP&E conducted extensive research 
on the processes that companies use to 
classify chemical hazards, to develop 
SDSs and labels, and to handle, store, 
and use hazardous chemicals. PP&E 
evaluated how these processes would be 
affected by the proposed revisions to the 
HCS and analyzed the potential savings 
that would be realized as a result of 
adopting these revisions. Based on 
PP&E’s research, OSHA has concluded 
that the annual cost savings for these 
companies would be an estimated $585 
million. 
As an additional benefit, the 
modification of the HCS by the 
inclusion of the globally harmonized 
system (GHS) of classification and 
labelling of chemicals would be 
expected to facilitate international trade, 
increasing competition, increasing 
export opportunities for U.S. businesses, 
reducing costs for imported products, 
and generally expanding the selection of 
chemicals and products available to 
U.S. businesses and consumers. As a 
result of both the direct savings 
resulting from harmonization and the 
increased competitiveness, prices for 
the affected chemicals and products, 
and the corresponding goods and 
services using them, would be lowered. 
The proposed revisions may also 
result in reductions in the costs 
associated with providing training for 
employees as required by the existing 
OSHA HCS. 
Finally, the proposed GHS 
modifications to the OSHA HCS would 
meet the international goals for 
adoption and implementation of the 
GHS that were supported by the U.S. 
government. Implementing GHS in U.S. 
Federal laws and policies through 
appropriate legislative and regulatory 
action was anticipated by the U.S. 
support of international mandates 
regarding the GHS in the 
Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical 
Safety, the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development, and the 
United Nations. It is also consistent 
with the established goals of the 
Strategic Approach to International 
Chemical Management that the U.S. 
helped to craft (see http:// 
www.chem.unep.ch/saicm/). 
Table VII–1 provides a summary of 
the costs and benefits of the proposed 
modifications to the OSHA HCS, and it 
shows the net benefits of the 
modifications to the standard, which are 
estimated to be $754 million annually. 
Because compliance with the proposed 
standard would result in cost savings 
that exceed costs, OSHA has not 
provided estimates of costs per life 
saved or other metrics of cost- 
effectiveness. However, it should be 
noted that the estimated benefits exceed 
costs by a factor of eight.

has already been achieved with regard 
to the new requirements; nor do they 
include costs necessary to achieve 
compliance with existing requirements, 
to the extent that some employers may 
currently not be fully complying with 
applicable regulatory requirements. 
The costs associated with compliance 
with the proposed revisions to the HCS 
would generally be incurred by the 
affected industries as one-time 
transition costs over the phase-in period 
of three years. Aside from the transition 
costs, the ongoing annual compliance 
costs associated with the proposed 
revisions to the HCS generally are 
expected to be the same or lower than 
under the existing standard. 
The compliance costs are expressed as 
an annualized cost for purposes of 
assessing the cost-effectiveness of the 
proposed revisions, in order to be able 
to compare the economic impact of the 
rulemaking with other regulatory 
actions, and to be able to add and track 
Federal regulatory compliance costs and 
economic impacts in a consistent 
manner. Annualized costs also represent 
a better measure for assessing the 
longer-term potential impacts of the 
rulemaking. The annualized cost was 
calculated by annualizing the one-time 
costs over a period of 20 years and 
applying a discount rate of 7 percent, as 
recommended by the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
The total annualized cost of 
compliance with the proposed standard 
is estimated to be about $97 million. 
The major cost elements associated with 
the revisions to the standard include the 
classification of chemical hazards in 
accordance with the GHS criteria and 
the corresponding revision of safety data 
sheets and labels to meet new format 
and content requirements ($11 million); 
training for employees to become 
familiar with new warning symbols and 
the revised safety data sheet format ($44 
million); and management 
familiarization and other management- 
related costs as may be necessary ($42 
million). 
Economic Impacts 
To assess the nature and magnitude of 
the economic impacts associated with 
compliance with the proposed rule, 
OSHA developed quantitative estimates 
of the potential economic impact of the 
new requirements on entities in each of 
the affected industry sectors. The 
estimated compliance costs were 
compared with industry revenues and 
profits to provide an assessment of the 
economic feasibility of complying with 
the revised standard and an evaluation 
of the potential economic impacts. 
Only the compliance costs were 
considered for purposes of assessing the 
potential economic impacts and 
economic feasibility of the proposed 
revisions. As described in section D of 
this PEA, the overall economic impacts 
associated with this rulemaking are 
expected to result in significant net 
benefits to employers, employees, and 
the economy generally. 
As described in greater detail in 
section G of this PEA, the costs of 
compliance with the proposed 
rulemaking are not large in relation to 
the corresponding annual financial 
flows associated with each of the 
affected industry sectors. The estimated 
costs of compliance represent about 
0.0004 percent of revenues and about 
0.007 percent of profits, on average, 
across all entities; compliance costs do 
not represent more than 0.02 percent of 
revenues or more than 0.3 percent of 
profits in any individual affected 
industry sector. 
The economic impact of achieving 
compliance with the proposal, without 
considering the associated benefits, is 
most likely to consist of an extremely 
small increase in prices of about 0.0004 
percent, on average, for affected 
hazardous chemicals. It is highly 
unlikely that a price increase of this 
magnitude would significantly alter the 
types or amounts of goods and services 
demanded by the public or any other 
affected customers or intermediaries. If 
the compliance costs of the proposal can 
be substantially recouped with a 
minimal increase in prices, there may be 
little or no effect on profits. 
In general, for most establishments, it 
would be very unlikely that none of the 
compliance costs could be passed along 
in the form of increased prices. In the 
event that a price increase of 0.0004 
percent were not possible, profits in the 
affected industries would be reduced by 
an average of about 0.007 percent. 
Given the minimal potential impact 
on prices or profits in the affected 
industries, OSHA has preliminarily 
concluded that compliance with the 
requirements of the proposed 
rulemaking would be economically 
feasible in every affected industry 
sector. 
In addition, based on an analysis of 
the costs and economic impacts 
associated with this rulemaking, OSHA 
preliminarily concludes that the effect 
of the proposed standard on 
employment, wages, and economic 
growth for the United States would be 
negligible. The effect on international 
trade is likely to be beneficial and 
similar to the effect of a small reduction 
in non-tariff trade barriers. 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Screening 
Analysis 
OSHA has analyzed the potential 
impact of the proposed rule on small 
entities, and has prepared an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Screening 
Analysis (IRFSA) in conjunction with 
this rulemaking to describe the potential 
effects on small entities. The IRFSA is 
included as a part of this PEA in section 
H. 
As a result of the analysis of the 
potential impact on small entities, 
OSHA concludes and certifies that the 
rulemaking would not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. Therefore, an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) is not 
required for this rulemaking. 
Nevertheless, OSHA has voluntarily 
provided the elements of the IRFA as 
part of the IRFSA presented in Section 
H. In proceeding with this rulemaking, 
OSHA will fulfill its requirements under 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act and under 
the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act, as applicable, 
to ensure that no unnecessary burdens 
are imposed on small businesses.

Employees in work environments 
addressed by the HCS are exposed to a 
variety of significant hazards associated 
with chemicals used in the workplace 
that can and do cause serious injury and 
death. OSHA’s HCS was designed to 
assure that employers and employees 
are provided the information they need 
about the chemical hazards in chemical 
products both to make informed 
purchases and to provide for safe use. In 
the existing HCS, OSHA developed a set 
of requirements for chemical products, 
to include mandatory classification, 
labeling, and detailed information 
provision (in safety data sheets). OSHA 
believes that the improvements in the 
proposed rule would make the hazard 
communication system more worker- 
protective and more efficient and 
effective. In addition, the improvements 
would have the effect of harmonizing

2 In contrast to a uniformity standard, a 
specification standard, such as an engineering 
standard, would spell out, in detail, the equipment 
or technology that must be used to achieve 
compliance. The usual rationale for a specification 
standard is that compliance would be difficult to 
verify under a performance standard; hence, only a 
specification standard would guarantee that 
employees are protected against the risk in 
question. Note that an engineering standard would 
generally not provide efficiencies or economies to 
the regulated community. On the contrary, an 
engineering standard would impose additional 
costs on some firms, in that they could effectively 
protect workers using an alternative approach, if it 
were permitted. 
It is also worth noting that, for uniformity 
standards with technological implications, the 
benefits of reduced information costs, economies of 
uniformity, and facilitation of exchange may need 
to be weighed against possible losses of flexibility, 
experimentation, and innovation. However, because 
GHS is limited to the presentation of hazard 
information and does not involve technological or 
strategic considerations, the possible costs of 
uniformity here would be non-existent or 
minuscule. 
3 On the ability of individuals to more fully and 
effectively utilize knowledge when uniformity 
requirements are present, see Hemenway, 1975, pp. 
34–35. 
4 The coverage of fewer mixtures is due to the 
bridging principles and formula being applied to 
their classification, rather than being based strictly 
on a 1 percent cut-off. 
hazard communication to facilitate 
international trade—replacing a 
plethora of national rules with a single 
international system. 
The proposed standard, through 
conformance with GHS (as explained in 
Section IV of the preamble), contains a 
number of changes to improve the 
performance of the U.S. hazard 
communication system: 
• Revised criteria for more consistent 
classification of chemical hazards; 
• Standardized signal words, 
pictograms, hazard statements, and 
precautionary statements on labels; and 
• A standardized format for SDSs. 
In short, GHS is a ‘‘uniformity 
standard’’ for the presentation of hazard 
information (Hemenway, 1975, p. 8). 
And much like other uniformity 
standards, such as driving on the right 
side of the road (in the U.S.), screw 
threads for fire hose connectors, 
‘‘handshake’’ protocols for 
communication between computers, 
and, for that matter, language, GHS 
would provide significant efficiencies 
and economies.2 In the case of GHS, 
manufacturers would be able to produce 
SDSs at lower cost, and users of SDSs 
would be able to more fully and quickly 
utilize the information contained in the 
SDSs, thereby reducing costs and, more 
importantly, better protect workers 
against chemical hazards.3 
Since publication of the existing HCS, 
there has been some movement by 
industry toward standardization, 
consistent with the proposed revisions. 
However, OSHA does not believe that 
full and comprehensive standardization, 
as required under the proposed 
revisions, or that the goal of 
harmonizing the U.S. system with the 
international one could be achieved 
voluntarily in the absence of regulation. 
First, in a basic sense, GHS cannot 
simply be implemented by the market. 
Some aspects of GHS, such as the 
reorganization of SDSs, would be 
allowed under the existing OSHA 
standard, but other aspects, such as the 
classifications system, would not be. 
Use of differing classification criteria 
would lead to label warnings that are 
not consistent with current HCS 
requirements in some situations. Thus, 
at a minimum, OSHA would need to 
modify HCS to allow the use of GHS in 
the U.S. OSHA cannot simply provide a 
compliance interpretation that labels 
and safety data sheets prepared in 
accordance with the GHS meet the HCS 
requirements because the requirements 
of a standard cannot be changed through 
a compliance interpretation. While there 
is considerable overlap between the 
HCS and the GHS in terms of coverage, 
there are differences in the criteria used 
to classify both substances and mixtures 
that will result in different hazards 
being covered in some situations. This 
is particularly true in the area of acute 
toxicity, where OSHA is covering more 
substances under the modified rule than 
the current HCS, but potentially fewer 
mixtures.4 
Second, it is important to understand 
that while the costs of creating SDSs 
and labels under GHS are borne directly 
by the chemical producers, the bulk of 
the benefits of adopting GHS accrue to 
the users. The set of all users includes 
employers who are direct customers of 
a chemical manufacturer, employees 
who use or are exposed to workplace 
chemicals, and emergency responders, 
who typically have no market 
relationship with the producers of the 
chemical. Even if one thought that 
market forces might assure the socially 
optimal approach to SDSs between 
manufacturers of chemicals and their 
customers, there are limited market 
forces at work between the chemical 
manufacturer and these two other sets of 
users—the employees and the 
emergency response community. 
Therefore, the presence of positive GHS 
externalities would prevent the private 
market, without regulation, from 
achieving the socially optimal adoption 
of GHS. 
OSHA does anticipate that there will 
be some increased market pressure to 
comply with GHS that will affect some 
firms that may think that they have no 
need to switch to the GHS system 
because they do not ship their products 
internationally. Many small firms do not 
realize the extent to which they are 
involved in international trade. There 
are probably few companies who have 
products that are never involved in 
international trade, or who never import 
chemical products and need hazard 
communication information for them. 
Many chemical producers ship their 
products to distributors and are 
unaware of where their products are 
ultimately used. OSHA can envision a 
likely scenario in which these 
distributors provide pressure to their 
suppliers to become GHS-compliant. 
Further, small companies sell products 
to larger companies. The larger 
companies may use those products to 
prepare goods that are exported. These 
larger companies might also be expected 
to pressure their small firm suppliers to 
be GHS-compliant. Nevertheless, such 
an approach would surely involve a 
long transition period, with attendant 
losses in worker protection and 
production efficiencies, and it is 
doubtful that market pressure alone 
would achieve full compliance. 
The changes made by GHS will 
involve costs for all parties. Producers 
of chemicals will incur substantial costs 
but will also achieve benefits—in part 
because they themselves benefit as both 
producers and users, and in part, as a 
result of foreign trade benefits that 
OSHA has not quantified. Some 
producers will not see these types of 
trade benefits if they do not engage in 
exporting chemicals. However, many 
small companies are currently 
prevented from engaging in 
international trade because of the 
substantial burdens of complying with 
many different countries’ requirements. 
International harmonization of hazard 
communication requirements would 
enable these small companies to become 
involved in international trade if they so 
desire. 
Of more significance to the concerns 
of the OSH Act, the changes also 
provide substantial benefits to users, 
including: 
• Fewer illnesses, injuries, fatalities, 
and accidents due to a more consistent, 
comprehensible, and clearer system that 
does not require English literacy to 
obtain some minimal hazard 
information; 
• Greater ease of use of SDSs; and 
• Reduced training requirements for 
workers due to a clearer and more 
uniform system. 
Because many of these benefits 
require uniformity, and the benefits are 
dispersed throughout a network of 
producers and users, only some of

which have direct market relationships 
with each other, OSHA believes that 
only a single, uniform standard can 
achieve the full net benefits available to 
a hazard communications system. 
C. Profile of Affected Industries 
The proposed revisions to the HCS 
would affect establishments in a variety 
of different industries in which 
employees are exposed to hazardous 
chemicals or in which hazardous 
chemicals are produced. Every 
workplace in OSHA’s jurisdiction in 
which employees are exposed to 
hazardous chemicals is covered by the 
HCS and is required to have a hazard 
communication program. 
The proposed revisions to the HCS are 
not anticipated to either increase or 
decrease the scope of affected industries 
or establishments. The proposed 
revisions define and revise specific 
classifications and categories of hazards, 
but the scope of the requirements under 
which a chemical, substance, or mixture 
becomes subject to the requirements of 
the standard are not substantially 
different from the current HCS. 
Therefore, the proposed revisions 
should have little or no effect on 
whether an entire establishment falls 
within the scope of the standard. OSHA 
requests comments from the public 
regarding this preliminary 
determination. 
For establishments with employees 
exposed to hazardous chemicals, the 
proposed revisions to the HCS would 
generally involve management 
becoming familiar with and employees 
receiving training on the new warning 
labels and the new format of the SDSs. 
For establishments producing or 
importing hazardous chemicals, 
generally as part of the chemical 
manufacturing industry, the revisions to 
the standard would involve 
reclassifying chemicals in accordance 
with the new classification system and 
revising safety data sheets and labels 
associated with hazardous chemicals. 
OSHA’s estimates of the number of 
employees covered by the standard are 
based on the preliminary determination 
that all production employees in 
manufacturing would be covered, and 
that, in addition, employees in other 
industries working in any of the 
occupations specified in the PP&E 
report would also be exposed to 
hazardous chemicals. 
Table VII–2 provides an overview of 
the industries and estimated numbers of 
employees potentially affected by the 
HCS. OSHA welcomes additional 
information and data that may help 
improve the accuracy of these estimates. 
The industries and establishments 
affected by the proposed revisions can 
be divided into two categories. The first 
category contains establishments that 
are required to produce labels and SDSs; 
the second category contains 
establishments that do not produce 
labels or SDSs but are required to 
provide employee access to labels and 
SDSs, supplied by others, for the 
chemicals to which their employees 
may be exposed in the workplace. As 
noted, OSHA has preliminarily judged 
that SDSs for imported chemicals would 
normally be produced in the country of 
origin, and thus would not represent 
expenses for importers or other US 
firms. 
As shown in Table VII–2, 
approximately 75,000 firms, in over 
90,000 establishments, create hazardous 
chemicals (i.e., products, substances, or 
mixtures) for which a label and an SDS 
are required in accordance with the 
OSHA HCS. Approximately 880,000 
SDSs and corresponding container 
labels would be potentially affected by 
the proposed revisions to the HCS. 
OSHA estimates that the adoption of 
GHS through this proposal would not 
significantly change the numbers of 
labels and SDSs produced. OSHA 
welcomes comment on this issue. 
In many instances, firms may be 
already producing several different 
versions of SDSs and labels for the same 
product to satisfy different regulatory 
requirements in different jurisdictions, 
including SDSs and labels consistent 
with GHS criteria. For these products, 
the proposed revisions to the OSHA 
HCS would be satisfied relatively easily 
and may result in a reduction in overall 
compliance costs by reducing the 
number of different labels and SDSs 
needed for each affected product.

6 For example, one commenter on the ANPR, 
representing an organization whose membership 
includes first response and emergency management, 
wrote the following: ‘‘The emergency planning and 
first responder community depends upon MSDS 
information for life and safety. The ability to 
immediately examine an MSDS and glean hazard 
and response information at the scene of an 
incident is critically important. The lives of first 
responders, employees of the facility and the public 
depend upon the accuracy and ease of use of the 
MSDS.’’ (Document ID # 0033.) 
7 OSHA believes that a reasonable range for the 
magnitude of the health and safety benefits 
resulting from the proposed revisions would be 
equal to between 0.5 percent and 5 percent of the 
benefits associated with the existing HCS. These 
ranges are considered in the sensitivity analysis 
presented in Section VII.K. 
SDSs that would be affected or 
produced as a result of this proposal. 
The second category of industries and 
establishments affected by the proposed 
revisions contains those that do not 
produce SDSs but are required to 
provide their employees with access to 
SDSs supplied by others as part of a 
hazard communication program 
covering chemicals to which employees 
may be exposed in the workplace. The 
effects on these establishments would 
generally involve promoting employee 
awareness of and management 
familiarization with the revisions to 
SDSs and labels. 
As shown in Table VII–2, an 
estimated 38 million employees are 
potentially exposed to hazardous 
chemicals in these workplaces and are 
covered by the OSHA HCS. Including 
employees working in establishments 
that produce SDSs, a total of 41 million 
employees would potentially need to 
become familiar with the proposed 
revisions to SDSs and labels. As also 
shown in Table VII–2, OSHA estimates 
that there are over five million 
workplaces where employees may be 
potentially exposed to hazardous 
chemicals. OSHA requests comments 
and information from the public 
regarding these estimates. 
D. Benefits, Net Benefits, and Cost- 
Effectiveness 
OSHA estimates that the 
promulgation of the proposed revisions 
would result in substantial benefits from 
a variety of sources. OSHA’s estimates 
of the benefits include improvements in 
occupational safety and health and a 
corresponding reduction in the annual 
number of injuries, illnesses, and 
fatalities sustained by employees from 
exposure to hazardous chemicals; 
reductions in costs for producers of 
hazardous chemicals; increased 
efficiencies in the handling and use of 
hazardous chemicals; and other benefits 
as described in this section. OSHA 
requests comments and information 
from the public regarding the nature and 
extent of any benefits that may be 
associated with the proposed revisions. 
OSHA expects the proposed revisions 
to the HCS would result in an increased 
degree of safety and health for the 
affected employees and to reduce the 
number of accidents, fatalities, injuries, 
and illnesses associated with exposure 
to hazardous chemicals. 
As explained in detail in Section V of 
the preamble, the design of GHS was 
based on years of extensive research that 
demonstrated the effectiveness of 
pictograms, specific signal words, and a 
standardized format. As a result of this 
research, OSHA is confident that the 
GHS revisions to the HCS standard for 
labeling and safety data sheets would 
enable employees exposed to workplace 
chemicals to more quickly obtain and 
more easily understand information 
about the hazards associated with those 
chemicals. Warning labels on products 
covered by the standard, which provide 
an immediate visual reminder of the 
chemical hazards involved, would be 
made more intuitive, self-explanatory, 
and logical, and the nature and extent 
of any associated hazards would be 
more readily understood as a result of 
the training required under the 
proposal. Relatedly, the revisions are 
expected to improve the use of 
appropriate exposure controls and work 
practices that can reduce the safety and 
health risks associated with exposure to 
hazardous chemicals. 
In addition, the standardized format 
of the safety data sheets would enable 
critical information to be accessed more 
easily and quickly during emergencies. 
This can reduce the risk of injury, 
illness, and death to exposed employees 
and to rescue personnel and can reduce 
property damage. 
It is difficult to quantify precisely 
how many injuries, illnesses, and 
fatalities would be prevented due to the 
proposed revisions to the HCS. The 
benefits associated with the existing 
HCS may help provide a general sense 
of the potential magnitude of the 
benefits of the proposed revisions to the 
HCS. A discussion and analysis of the 
benefits that would result from the 
implementation of the existing OSHA 
HCS were included as part of the 
rulemaking process for the 
promulgation of the existing standard in 
the 1980s. 
The existing HCS was originally 
promulgated in two parts. First, a final 
rule covering the manufacturing 
industry was published in the Federal 
Register in 1983 (48 FR 53280, 
November 25, 1983); a second final rule 
covering other general industries, 
maritime industries, construction 
industries, and agricultural industries 
was published in the Federal Register 
in 1987 (52 FR 31852, August 24, 1987). 
For both of these final rules, OSHA 
conducted research specifically 
regarding the benefits that could be 
expected from the promulgation of these 
standards, as described in the preambles 
to the final rules. In addition, through 
the rulemaking process, OSHA 
evaluated the best available evidence, 
including the data and comments 
submitted by the public. 
The information, data sources, 
analyses, and findings related to the 
estimation of the benefits associated 
with the standards are included in the 
public records for the rulemakings. The 
complete rulemaking records for these 
standards can be found in OSHA public 
dockets H–022B and H–022D. 
The estimated benefits associated 
with the Hazard Communication 
Standards were published in the 
Federal Register with the promulgation 
of the final standards (48 FR 53329, 
November 25, 1983 and 52 FR 31872, 
August 24, 1987). OSHA estimated that 
compliance with the various Hazard 
Communication Standards would 
produce annual benefits that would 
include the prevention of 31,841 non- 
lost-workday injuries and illnesses, 
20,263 lost-workday injuries and 
illnesses, 6,410 chronic illnesses, and 
4,260 fatalities. 
Using a willingness-to-pay approach 
for valuing these benefits, OSHA 
determined that the annual safety and 
health benefits would be over $18.2 
billion annually, expressed in 1985 
dollars. According to the inflation 
calculator provided by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the buying power of 
$18.2 billion in 1985 is equivalent to the 
buying power of about $35.3 billion in 
2007 after adjusting for inflation of 94 
percent over the period.5 
Based on the material presented in 
this preamble, OSHA expects that the 
proposed revisions to the HCS would 
result in incremental improvements in 
employee health and safety above that 
already achieved under the existing 
HCS. For purposes of this proposal, 
OSHA has selected an estimate of 1 
percent of the health and safety benefits 
due to the existing HCS as the benefits 
that could be attributed to compliance 
with the proposed revisions. It is 
conceivable that actual benefits might 
be somewhat lower, but because GHS is 
expected to result, in some situations, in 
more timely and appropriate treatment 
of exposed workers, OSHA believes 
actual benefits may be larger, perhaps 
several times larger.6 7

8 The formula for annualizing the benefits is equal 
to: 
[(1.07)¥3] * [ (1¥(1.07)¥17)/0.07] * [0.07/ 
((1¥(1.07)¥20)], 
where the first term in brackets reflects the three 
year delay until annual benefits are realized; the 
second term in brackets reflects the present value 
of seventeen years of annual benefits (from years 4 
through 20), and the third term in brackets 
annualizes the present value of benefits over a 20- 
year period. 
9 For example, as described by PP&E, the job of 
a logistics person, depending on the company, 
consists of the following tasks: (1) Receive 
hazardous chemicals; (2) gather the associated 
SDSs—either those that are attached to the 
shipment or those that are attached to the invoice; 
(3) extract the relevant information from the SDSs 
and enter it in the plant’s SDS management system; 
(4) insert paper copies of the SDSs into the (hard 
copy) SDS management folder; (5) if the 
information is not available (particularly in the 
older 9-section SDSs), then look for 12-section SDSs 
prepared by some other manufacturer; (6) prepare 
in-plant labels; (7) determine special storage and 
use requirements, make appropriate arrangements 
for short-term and long-term storage, and distribute 
information to different process lines or field 
offices; (9) participate in the training of line 
supervisors and production workers; (10) train new 
employees; and (11) carry out other logistics duties 
at the plant. The proposed GHS standard, by 
making the structure and content of SDS uniform, 
would help to reduce the time it takes to perform 
each of the above tasks. 
10 These estimates assume 2,000 hours of work a 
year for 7,070 health and safety supervisors and 
52,280 logistics personnel specializing in handling 
hazardous chemicals in the manufacturing sector; 
an hourly wage of $47; and a time savings of 3 
percent and 15 percent, respectively, for health and 
safety supervisors and logistics personnel. The 
resulting annual savings of $757 million was 
multiplied by 0.7523 to annualize the savings over 
a twenty-year period with savings not accruing 
until three years after the effective date of the 
revisions. 
If the 1 percent estimate is correct, 
then once all requirements take effect, 
they would result in the prevention of 
318 non-lost-workday injuries and 
illnesses, 203 lost-workday injuries and 
illnesses, 64 chronic illnesses, and 43 
fatalities annually. The monetized value 
of these health and safety benefits is an 
estimated $353 million annually. 
In order to obtain a sense of how 
realistic these estimated safety and 
health benefits are in light of the current 
level of occupational injuries, illnesses, 
and fatalities that are chemically- 
related, OSHA reviewed relevant BLS 
data for the periods 1992–2007. OSHA’s 
examination of these data shows a 42 
percent decline in chemically-related 
acute injuries and illnesses over the 
period, but both remain significant 
problems—55,400 chemically-related 
illnesses and 125 chemically related- 
fatalities in 2007. However these readily 
measurable reported acute illnesses and 
fatalities are dwarfed by chronic 
illnesses and fatalities. For chronic 
illness fatalities, there is little 
information available, and certainly no 
annual time series data. The most recent 
estimate is that there were 46,900 to 
73,700 fatalities due to occupational 
illnesses in 1992 (Leigh et al., 1997). 
OSHA believes these more recent data 
from 1992–2007 show that it is 
plausible that HCS has had a desirable 
effect on chemically-related illnesses 
and injuries, but there remains a very 
significant role for further and better 
hazard information, as would be 
provided by GHS. 
OSHA requests information and data 
from the public that could assist the 
agency in more accurately determining 
the safety and health benefits associated 
with the proposed revisions. 
The annual benefits associated with 
the proposed revisions to the OSHA 
HCS would generally begin after full 
implementation of the changes and 
associated employee training. The 
phase-in period is expected to take 
about three years. Thus, in order to 
calculate the estimated annualized 
benefits over a twenty-year period 
associated with this proposed rule in a 
manner that would be comparable to the 
corresponding annualized costs, the 
delay in the realization of the benefits 
was incorporated into the calculation. 
Using a discount rate of 7 percent, the 
annual benefits beginning three years 
after the effective date of the revisions 
were multiplied by 0.7523 to calculate 
the annualized benefits over a twenty- 
year period beginning with the effective 
date of the final rule.8 Thus, the 
annualized monetized benefit associated 
with the reduction in safety and health 
risks attributable to the proposed 
revisions is an estimated $266 million. 
Other substantial benefits, in addition 
to the improved occupational safety and 
health of affected employees, are also 
expected to result from this rulemaking, 
as discussed in the following 
paragraphs. 
The harmonization of hazard 
classifications, safety data sheet formats, 
and warning labels for affected 
chemicals and products would yield 
substantial savings to the businesses 
involved in these activities. Fewer 
different SDSs would have to be 
produced for affected chemicals, and 
many SDSs would be able to be 
produced at lower cost due to 
harmonization and standardization. The 
benefits represented by these cost 
reductions would primarily affect 
businesses involved in chemical 
manufacturing. 
In addition, reductions in operating 
costs are also expected as a result of the 
promulgation of the proposed revisions 
for many businesses that purchase or 
use hazardous chemicals. The current 
non-uniformity of SDSs and labels 
received by establishments in 
practically all industries requires 
employees and managers in numerous 
positions to spend additional time on a 
daily basis to ascertain the appropriate 
way to handle and store the hazardous 
chemicals in their workplace. Under the 
revised standard, the presence of 
uniform and consistent information 
would help employers and employees to 
make decisions more efficiently and 
save substantial time. 
PP&E conducted extensive research 
on the processes that companies use to 
classify chemical hazards, to develop 
SDSs and labels, and to handle, store, 
and use hazardous chemicals. PP&E 
evaluated how these processes would be 
affected by the proposed revisions to the 
HCS and analyzed the potential savings 
that would be realized as a result of 
adopting these revisions. 
Based on the PP&E report, OSHA 
developed estimates of the cost 
reductions that the affected companies 
would expect to obtain as a result of the 
proposed revisions to the OSHA HCS. 
Among the various benefits expected to 
be realized as a result of the 
implementation of the proposed 
revisions, as described in this section, 
OSHA quantified two general categories 
of cost savings. First, OSHA estimated 
the number of hours that each industry 
would save by improving the efficiency 
and productivity of personnel who use 
SDSs in performing their job functions. 
OSHA estimated that the amount of 
time spent during affected activities in 
the manufacturing sector could be 
reduced by 3 percent for health and 
safety supervisors and by 15 percent for 
logistics personnel specializing in 
handling hazardous chemicals.9 OSHA 
further estimated that this time 
reduction, and the associated cost 
savings, would apply to about 7,000 
health and safety supervisors and 
52,000 logistics personnel in the 
manufacturing sector and would yield 
annualized benefits of approximately 
$569 million.10 Similar potential time 
and cost savings as a result of the 
proposed revisions to the OSHA HCS 
were not quantified for the non- 
manufacturing sectors. 
Second, OSHA estimated that, for the 
manufacturing sectors, the costs 
associated with the creation and 
revision of SDSs in future years would 
be reduced by the proposed revisions. 
The creation and revision of individual 
SDSs would be less burdensome, and, in 
addition, fewer different versions of 
SDSs would need to be produced for 
affected chemicals and products. OSHA 
estimated that, depending on firm size, 
the combination of these two effects

11 These estimates assume 1⁄3 of the estimated 
880,260 SDSs are reviewed each year; savings per 
SDS is between 21⁄2 and 4 hours, depending on firm 
size (with an average per SDS of about 3.2 hours); 
personnel reviewing the SDSs receive an hourly 
wage of $47; and existing compliance rates are 
between 1 percent and 75 percent, depending on 
firm size (with an average per SDS of about 53 
percent). The resulting annual savings of $21 
million was multiplied by 0.7523 to annualize the 
savings over a twenty-year period with savings not 
accruing until three years after the effective date of 
the revisions. 
12 One of these commenters is an international 
trade association for the institutional and industrial 
cleaning industry that represents over 4,600 
manufacturer, distributor, building service 
contractor, and in-house service provider members 
worldwide. The other is a trade association 
representing some 400 manufacturers of paints, 
coatings, adhesives, sealants, and caulks, raw 
materials suppliers to the industry, and product 
distributors. 
would result in annual savings 
equivalent to between 2.5 and 4 hours 
of a professional’s time per existing SDS 
and a total annualized savings of $16 
million.11 
Combining the improved productivity 
of personnel who use SDSs and the 
improved efficiency of those who revise 
SDSs and labels, OSHA concluded that 
the annual cost savings for companies in 
the manufacturing sector would be an 
estimated $585 million. 
A secondary benefit of the adoption of 
GHS is that it would facilitate 
international trade, increasing 
competition, increasing export 
opportunities for U.S. businesses, 
reducing costs for imported products, 
and generally expanding the selection of 
chemicals and products available to 
U.S. businesses and consumers. As a 
result of the direct savings resulting 
from the harmonization and the 
associated increase in international 
competition, prices for the affected 
chemicals and products, and the 
corresponding goods and services using 
them, should decline, although perhaps 
only by a small amount. 
The proposed revisions may also 
result in reductions in the costs 
associated with providing training for 
employees as required by the existing 
OSHA HCS. Companies would save 
considerable time and effort in training 
new employees in the future. The 
potential savings would be attributable 
in part to reducing or eliminating the 
need to explain the different types of 
formats used to convey hazard 
information and the different types of 
information included in the contents of 
SDSs and labels. 
Finally, the proposed GHS 
modifications to the OSHA HCS would 
meet the international goals for 
adoption and implementation of the 
GHS that were supported by the U.S. 
government. Implementing GHS in U.S. 
Federal laws and policies through 
appropriate legislative and regulatory 
action was anticipated by the U.S. 
support of international mandates 
regarding the GHS in the 
Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical 
Safety, the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development, and the 
United Nations. It is also consistent 
with the established goals of the 
Strategic Approach to International 
Chemical Management that the U.S. 
helped to craft. 
Table VII–1 provides a summary of 
the costs and benefits of the proposed 
revisions to the OSHA HCS, and it 
shows the net benefits and cost- 
effectiveness of the revisions to the 
standard. Net monetized benefits are 
estimated to be $754 million annually. 
The cost-effectiveness of the standard 
can be expressed as more than eight 
dollars of benefits for every dollar of 
cost. 
Some qualitative evidence of the cost- 
effectiveness of the standard was 
provided by comments submitted in 
response to the Advance Notice for 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) 
published by OSHA in the Federal 
Register on September 12, 2006 (71 FR 
53617). There was widespread (but not 
unanimous) support among the 
commenters for the adoption of GHS in 
the United States. This included 
commenters who provided some of the 
largest estimates of the costs of the 
proposed revisions. (Document IDs # 
0032 and # 0050).12 
E. Technological Feasibility 
In accordance with the OSH Act, 
OSHA is required to demonstrate that 
occupational safety and health 
standards promulgated by the Agency 
are technologically feasible. In 
fulfillment of this requirement, OSHA 
has reviewed the requirements that 
would be imposed by the proposal, and 
has assessed their technological 
feasibility. As a result of this review, 
OSHA has determined that compliance 
with the requirements of the proposal is 
technologically feasible for all affected 
industries. OSHA requests comments 
and information from the public with 
regard to this preliminary 
determination. 
The proposal would require 
employers producing chemicals to 
reclassify chemicals in accordance with 
the new classification criteria and revise 
safety data sheets and labels associated 
with hazardous chemicals. Compliance 
with these requirements is not expected 
to involve any technological obstacles. 
The proposal would also require 
employers whose workplaces involve 
potential exposure to hazardous 
chemicals to train employees on the 
relevant aspects of the revised approach 
to hazard communication. Affected 
employees would need additional 
training to explain the new labels and 
safety data sheets. Compliance with 
these requirements is not expected to 
involve any technological obstacles. 
Compliance with all of the proposed 
requirements can be achieved with 
readily and widely available 
technologies. Businesses in the affected 
industries have long been required to be 
in compliance with the existing HCS 
which includes similar requirements. 
The revised HCS would simply require 
modifying the labels and SDSs for 
hazardous chemicals and adding some 
training to ensure employee 
familiarization with the changes made. 
Therefore, there are no new 
technologies required for compliance 
with the modifications. In addition, 
some businesses in the affected 
industries have already implemented 
many of the requirements of the 
proposed standard to varying degrees. 
OSHA believes that there are no 
technological constraints associated 
with compliance with any of the 
proposed requirements, and welcomes 
comments regarding this conclusion. 
F. Costs of Compliance 
Introduction 
This section presents the estimated 
costs of compliance for the proposed 
revisions to the OSHA HCS. The 
estimated costs of compliance represent 
the additional costs necessary for 
employers to achieve full compliance. 
They do not include costs associated 
with current compliance with the new 
requirements. 
The compliance costs associated with 
the proposal generally consist of the 
one-time transition costs to adopt the 
modified criteria for classifications and 
formats as required under the new 
system. Ongoing annual costs associated 
with compliance with the existing 
OSHA HCS are not expected to increase. 
As discussed in the benefits section, the 
adoption of the new system is expected 
to reduce some of the ongoing costs 
associated with compliance with the 
HCS after the completion of the 
transition period. 
The costs of compliance with the 
proposed revisions consist of three main 
categories: the cost of reclassification 
and revision of SDSs and labels, the cost 
of training employees, and the cost of 
management familiarization and other 
management costs associated with the 
administration of hazard 
communication programs.

The estimated compliance costs 
associated with the proposed revisions 
are based on a preliminary 
determination that the revisions would 
not significantly change the number of 
chemicals or products for which an SDS 
will be required, which also means that 
there will be no change in the number 
of establishments required to implement 
a hazard communication program. 
OSHA requests comments and 
information from the public regarding 
this preliminary determination. 
Other than the direct costs of 
reclassification and relabeling, the 
estimated compliance costs do not 
include any further costs or impacts that 
may result from the reclassification or 
relabeling of chemicals and products 
already subject to the HCS, such as 
possible changes in production or 
demand for products. Theoretically, 
such impacts, if any, with regard to 
possible changes in the uses and 
applications of affected chemicals, 
could be positive as well as negative. 
OSHA has preliminarily determined 
that such effects, if any, will not be 
significant, and requests comments and 
information from the public regarding 
this determination. 
In addition to the proposed revisions 
to the HCS, the proposed rulemaking 
also includes related proposed revisions 
to other OSHA standards. The revisions 
to the other standards generally ensure 
that all OSHA requirements related to 
hazard communication remain 
consistent with each other and become 
consistent with the GHS. OSHA has 
preliminarily determined that the 
proposed revisions to the other 
standards would not impose significant 
costs beyond those reflected in the 
preliminary compliance cost estimates 
for this rulemaking, and requests 
comments and information from the 
public regarding this determination. 
In order to have compliance costs 
presented on a consistent and 
comparable basis across various 
regulatory activities, the costs of 
compliance for this proposed rule are 
expressed in annualized terms. 
Annualized costs represent the more 
appropriate measure for assessing the 
longer-term potential impacts of the 
rulemaking. The estimated annualized 
cost of compliance is also provided for 
purposes of comparing compliance costs 
and cost-effectiveness across diverse 
regulations with a consistent metric. In 
addition, annualized costs are often 
used for accounting purposes to assess 
the cumulative costs of regulations on 
the economy or specific parts of the 
economy across different regulatory 
programs or across years. Annualized 
costs also permit costs and benefits to be 
presented in a comparable manner. The 
annualized cost was calculated by 
annualizing the one-time transition 
costs over a period of 20 years and 
applying a discount rate of 7 percent. 
Table VII–3 shows the estimated 
annualized compliance cost by cost 
category and by industry sector. As 
shown in Table VII–3, the total 
annualized cost of compliance with the 
proposed rulemaking is estimated to be 
about $97 million. Of this amount, the 
cost of chemical hazard reclassification 
and revision of SDSs and labels is an 
estimated $11 million, the cost of 
training employees is an estimated $44 
million, and the cost of management 
familiarization and other management 
costs is an estimated $42 million. 
As shown in Table VII–3, most of the 
compliance cost associated with 
chemical hazard reclassification and 
revision of SDSs and labels would be 
borne by the chemical manufacturing 
industry. Table VII–3 also shows that 
compliance costs are spread across all 
industries in the U.S. economy subject 
to OSHA jurisdiction, reflecting the fact 
that employee exposures to hazardous 
chemicals occur in almost every 
industry sector. 
OSHA expects that the compliance 
costs would be incurred over a period 
of three years, as the proposal would 
incorporate a three-year transition 
period into the compliance schedule for 
the standard. Specifically, for purposes 
of estimating the annualized compliance 
costs, OSHA assumed that the 
compliance costs associated with 
employee training would be incurred in 
the two-year period following the 
effective date of the final standard, and 
that other compliance costs would be 
incurred in the three-year period 
following the effective date of the final 
standard.

into account. A seven percent discount 
rate was applied to costs incurred in 
future years to calculate the present 
value of these costs for the base year in 
which the standard becomes effective, 
and the same discount rate was then 
applied to the total present value costs, 
over a 20-year period, to calculate the 
$97 million annualized costs. 
In the appendix to this cost section, 
Table VII–4 shows, by industry and by 
cost element, total non-annualized (non- 
discounted) compliance costs of about 
$1.1 billion estimated to be incurred 
during the three-year phase-in of the 
proposed revisions. 
Estimation of Compliance Costs 
The remainder of this section explains 
how the compliance costs were 
calculated by describing the data and 
methodology used to estimate each of 
the major cost elements. A more 
complete and detailed description of the 
estimation of compliance costs can be 
found in the PP&E report. 
The major elements of the proposed 
revisions that involve compliance costs 
include (1) the classification of 
chemicals in accordance with the 
proposed criteria and the revisions to 
the safety data sheets and labels 
corresponding to the affected hazardous 
chemicals; (2) incremental training for 
employees already trained under the 
existing OSHA hazard communication 
programs to ensure their familiarization 
with the new formats, information, and 
symbols that would be introduced into 
the workplace as a result of the 
proposed revisions; and in addition, (3) 
even though it is not directly a result of 
any specific requirement included in 
the proposed revisions, the cost for 
managers and administrators of hazard 
communication programs to become 
familiar with the revisions to the 
standard and to manage, update, and 
revise their programs as may be 
necessary to ensure compliance with the 
revised standard. 
The estimated compliance costs 
presented in this analysis of the 
proposed revisions to the HCS are 
largely based on research conducted by 
PP&E. PP&E performed this research 
under contract to the Department of 
Labor specifically for the purpose of 
developing estimates of compliance 
costs for, and assessing the potential 
impacts that may be associated with, 
possible revisions that may be made to 
the OSHA HCS in order to implement 
the GHS. 
The estimated costs of compliance 
with many of the provisions of the 
proposed standard involve wages paid 
for the labor hours required to fulfill the 
requirements. In some cases, 
compliance could be achieved by 
purchasing services or products in lieu 
of paying employees directly. The 
estimated compliance costs are intended 
to capture the resources required for 
compliance, regardless of how 
individual establishments may choose 
to achieve compliance. 
Costs Associated With Chemical 
Classifications and Revisions to Safety 
Data Sheets and Labels 
The proposed revisions to the OSHA 
HCS would continue to require firms 
that sell hazardous chemicals to 
employers to provide information about 
the associated hazards. Information is 
required to be presented in a safety data 
sheet (SDS) in the format specified in 
the revised standard, and some 
information is also required to be 
presented on product labels. 
The existing OSHA HCS already 
requires information about hazardous 
chemicals to be provided in SDSs and 
on labels. In addition, under the existing 
standard, SDSs are to be revised after a 
manufacturer or employer becomes 
aware of any significant new 
information about the hazards of a 
chemical. 
The proposed revisions to the 
standard would require chemicals to be 
classified into the appropriate hazard 
classes and categories based on the 
information about the chemicals that the 
manufacturers currently have. This 
information would have been assembled 
for purposes of conducting a hazard 
determination under the current HCS. In 
addition, the current HCS requires 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
to remain aware of developments 
regarding the hazards of the chemicals 
they produce or import in order to 
update the labels and SDSs for the 
chemicals in a timely manner. The 
classification of the chemicals into the 
hazard classes and categories under the 
revised provisions would not require 
any additional testing, studies, or 
research to be conducted. Manufacturers 
would be able to rely on the information 
they already have in determining how to 
properly classify their chemicals. 
Generally, chemical manufacturers 
and importers periodically review, 
revise, and update SDSs and labels. 
Changes are made as necessary as 
information regarding specific hazards 
develops, new information about 
protective measures is ascertained, or 
changes are made to product 
information and marketing materials. 
Labels and SDSs must also be produced 
or modified when products are 
introduced or changed. Therefore, there 
is a regular cycle of change for these 
documents for a variety of reasons. The 
proposed revisions may require a more 
extensive change than would normally 
occur, but the phase-in period is such 
that the chemical manufacturers and 
importers can take advantage of the 
normal cycle of change to phase in the 
revisions for all their products over a 
reasonable time period. This should 
have less impact on normal operations 
than a short time period that would 
require all SDSs and labels to be revised 
at the same time. 
The transition period that would be 
allowed by the delayed effective date for 
the requirement to adopt the new format 
should help ensure that the transition 
can be completed in conjunction with 
revisions and updates that would 
normally be expected to occur even 
without the implementation of the 
proposed revisions. In addition, the 
format required by the proposed 
revisions for SDSs is consistent with the 
format already adopted by the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) and 
therefore has already been implemented 
by many of the affected businesses. 
Based on the PP&E report, OSHA 
developed estimates of the costs that 
would be associated with the 
classification of chemicals in 
accordance with the proposed criteria 
and with the revisions to the 
corresponding SDSs and labels for those 
chemicals. The estimated compliance 
costs represent the incremental costs 
that would need to be incurred to 
achieve compliance with the proposed 
revisions; these estimated costs would 
be in addition to the costs that would 
already be incurred to continue to 
remain in compliance with applicable 
requirements of the existing HCS. 
The proposed revisions would allow 
for a transition period of three years 
following the publication of a final rule. 
During this period, even in the absence 
of any pertinent OSHA rulemaking, 
producers of affected chemicals would 
presumably be ensuring that the 
information provided in their SDSs and 
labels remains accurate and current. 
Producers of hazardous chemicals are 
generally expected to regularly review 
the available information regarding any 
hazards that may be associated with 
their products and to revise SDSs and 
labels accordingly. 
In addition, for every affected product 
that is newly created, reformulated, 
mixed with new ingredients, modified 
with new or different types of additives, 
or has any changes made in the 
proportions of the ingredients used, the 
chemical producer would be required 
under existing OSHA and other 
applicable standards to review the 
available hazard information, to classify 
the chemical in accordance with

13 By current compliance, OSHA means firms that 
have already reclassified chemicals and prepared 
SDSs and labels in accordance with proposed GHS 
requirements and would therefore be ready to 
introduce these modifications at negligible 
additional cost when GHS becomes effective. 
applicable hazard criteria, and to 
develop corresponding SDSs and labels. 
The estimated costs of compliance 
with the proposed revisions do not 
include the costs associated with 
activities such as those described in the 
above paragraphs, but rather reflect only 
the additional costs that chemical 
producers would not already be 
expected to incur. 
The estimated compliance costs 
associated with the proposed 
reclassification of hazards and changes 
to SDSs and labels are based on the 
numbers of SDSs affected. Based on the 
PP&E report, OSHA developed estimates 
of the number of potentially affected 
SDSs by industry, for each of the 
industries producing the corresponding 
chemicals and products (as shown in 
Table VII–2). Downstream users, 
distributors, and wholesalers are 
expected to continue to rely on SDSs 
provided by manufacturers to fulfill 
their obligations under the OSHA 
standard, as has been the practice for 
decades. OSHA requests comments and 
information from the public regarding 
this aspect of compliance with the 
standard. 
The costs of compliance associated 
with the classification of chemicals in 
accordance with the proposed criteria 
and with the revisions to the 
corresponding SDSs and labels for those 
chemicals were based on PP&E industry 
interviews and estimated as follows. 
Generally, for smaller establishments 
with relatively few chemicals affected, 
OSHA estimated the incremental 
compliance costs to be the equivalent of 
the cost of seven hours of time of a 
professional with the requisite expertise 
for each affected chemical, on average. 
Based on the PP&E report, OSHA 
estimated the cost of hourly 
compensation for a professional for this 
purpose to be $47. As a result, a small 
establishment (with fewer than 100 
employees) with 20 SDSs for 20 
chemicals, for example, would have 
estimated incremental compliance costs 
of $6,580 (7 hours times 20 SDSs times 
$47). 
In larger establishments with more 
affected chemicals, the incremental 
compliance costs were estimated to 
consist of two parts. First, labor costs 
were estimated according to the size of 
the establishment. OSHA, based on 
PP&E interviews with stakeholders, 
estimated that entities with 100 to 499 
employees would incur, on average, the 
equivalent of five hours of time of a 
professional with the requisite expertise 
for each affected chemical, and that 
entities with 500 or more employees 
would incur the equivalent of three 
hours of professional time per chemical. 
Based on the PP&E report, OSHA 
estimated the hourly compensation for a 
professional for this purpose to be $47. 
The labor cost per SDS was estimated 
to be lower for larger companies based 
on the determination that larger 
companies produce more SDSs, and 
would therefore experience efficiencies 
associated with producing them. These 
efficiencies include economies of scale, 
the use of software specifically designed 
to classify hazards and produce SDSs, 
and the generally lower cost per SDS 
associated with many mixtures. 
Second, many of these larger 
establishments may incur additional 
expenditures to purchase or modify 
software that can be used to classify 
chemicals and to produce 
corresponding SDSs and labels. Such 
software is available from a variety of 
vendors; the software can be purchased 
or used on a subscription basis. Publicly 
available information about the 
products and services being offered and 
sold to businesses for purposes of 
complying with hazard communication 
requirements indicates that most of the 
relevant vendors are aware of and 
prepared for an upcoming transition to 
the GHS, and that their products and 
services are or will be adapted to enable 
compliance with the proposed 
revisions. In addition, some firms may 
purchase custom or proprietary software 
from private vendors to achieve 
compliance with existing or proposed 
revisions to hazard communication 
requirements and for other purposes. 
Regardless of the particular approach 
individual companies may choose to 
most efficiently fulfill their obligations 
under the existing or proposed HCS, 
OSHA expects that a part of the costs 
associated with achieving compliance 
with the proposed revisions would 
involve costs attributable to software 
modifications. Based on industry data 
obtained by PP&E, OSHA apportioned 
these costs on a per-SDS basis and 
estimated the cost per SDS to be $200, 
on average. 
Based on the PP&E report, OSHA 
estimated the numbers of SDSs 
produced in each industry that would 
potentially need to be revised under the 
proposed standard, as shown in Table 
VII–2. A total of about 880,000 SDSs, 
one for each type of chemical produced 
by an individual manufacturer in the 
United States, were estimated to be in 
potential need of revision. 
In developing estimates of the 
compliance costs associated with the 
proposed rule, PP&E also considered the 
extent to which many firms have 
already performed the necessary 
reclassifications of chemical hazards 
and revisions to SDSs. Some chemical 
hazards have already been reclassified 
as would be required by the proposed 
OSHA standard because the U.S. 
Department of Transportation has 
required such classifications as part of 
their regulations for the transportation 
of hazardous chemicals (49 CFR parts 
171–180). The criteria for physical 
hazard classifications for purposes of 
transport have been internationally 
harmonized for some years, and these 
criteria formed the basis for the physical 
hazard criteria in the GHS. Therefore, 
many products intended for transport 
have already been classified under the 
new proposed physical hazard criteria 
as well as the existing criteria in the 
HCS. 
Many current SDSs are already 
produced to varying degrees in 
accordance with the requirements of the 
proposed OSHA standard because the 
widely-followed ANSI industry 
consensus standard already reflects 
many of these requirements in its 
relevant criteria. In addition, many 
firms have implemented or are 
beginning to implement hazard 
reclassifications, SDS revisions, 
software modifications, and other 
changes in accordance with the 
requirements of the proposed OSHA 
standard, because these provisions are 
generally anticipated to be adopted as 
part of the implementation of the GHS 
in countries and regions around the 
world. Since some other countries are 
already implementing the GHS, 
companies in the U.S. that ship to those 
countries are already having to comply 
with the GHS for products being 
exported. 
Research conducted by PP&E 
indicates that all of these factors 
contribute to a substantial degree of 
current compliance with the proposed 
rule, even if the existing OSHA standard 
remains unchanged.13 Based on the 
PP&E report, OSHA estimates that, on 
average, about 53 percent of the gross 
costs that would otherwise be associated 
with the proposed revisions to the HCS 
have already been incurred by firms. 
However, this average is a result of very 
different levels of current compliance 
for different sizes of firms. PP&E 
estimated that the percentage of firms in 
current compliance with the proposed 
revisions—with the exception of 
employee training—is 75 percent for 
firms with over 500 employees; 25 
percent for firms with 100 to 500 
employees; 5 percent for firms with 20

14 This annualized estimate of $11 million reflects 
software costs of $32 million and labor costs of 
$100 million multiplied by 0.082573 to annualize 
these costs (incurred over the first three years) over 
a 20-year period. The $32 million in software costs 
is the result of about 160,000 modified SDSs 
[(574,000 SDSs for large establishments × 25% not 
in existing compliance × 95% requiring 
modification) + (128,000 SDSs for establishments 
with 100–500 employees × 75% not in existing 
compliance × 25% requiring modification)] at a cost 
of $200 per SDS. The $100 million in labor cost is 
the result of about 413,000 affected SDSs multiplied 
by an average of 5.14 hours per SDS (from 3 to 7 
hours per SDS) multiplied by $47 per hour. 
The annualization factor, 0.082573, is equal to: 
[(1⁄3] * [ (1—(1.07)¥3)/0.07] * [0.07/((1— 
(1.07)¥20)], 
where the first term in brackets reflects the fact 
that these costs are assumed to be spread equally 
over the first three years; the second term in 
brackets calculates the present value of the costs, 
and the third term in brackets annualizes the 
present value of the costs over a 20-year period. 
to 99 employees; and 1 percent for firms 
with fewer than 20 employees. OSHA 
used these percentages to reduce the 
number of firms reported in Table VII– 
2 for purposes of estimating the costs for 
affected firms to comply with the 
proposed revisions (again, with the 
exception of employee training). 
Based on the preceding analysis, 
OSHA estimates an annualized cost of 
approximately $11 million for the 
classification of chemicals in 
accordance with the proposed criteria 
and for revisions to the corresponding 
SDSs and labels for those chemicals.14 
OSHA requests data and information 
from the public that would assist the 
Agency in ensuring that any costs 
associated with the proposed revisions 
are accurately estimated. For example, 
OSHA would appreciate data from 
individual companies on the number of 
actively distributed SDSs; the number 
that would be affected by the GHS 
proposal; the time required to revise 
SDSs; the occupation and hourly cost of 
the individuals working on the 
revisions; and whether software would 
need to be modified or purchased and 
the costs of the modification or 
purchase. 
As discussed below, OSHA received 
some comments from the public 
regarding the estimated costs associated 
with chemical classifications and 
revisions to safety data sheets in 
response to the Advance Notice for 
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) 
published by OSHA in the Federal 
Register on September 12, 2006 (71 FR 
53617). The comments received are 
publicly available as part of the 
rulemaking record, accessible through 
regulations.gov, in docket OSHA– 
H022K–2006–0062. Relevant 
information submitted by the public 
was incorporated into the development 
of the methodology and estimates 
presented in this preliminary economic 
analysis. 
Some commenters provided examples 
of cost estimates that generally support 
the estimates of the preliminary 
economic analysis. Information from 
other commenters provided a wide 
range of cost estimates. The figures 
presented in some comments appeared 
to correspond to gross costs of creating 
SDSs, and in other cases it was not clear 
whether gross or incremental costs were 
being presented. In general, commenters 
did not provide the rationale underlying 
their cost estimates. OSHA requests 
that, in submitting any data or 
information on compliance costs, 
commenters distinguish between the 
costs attributable to compliance with 
existing requirements, costs already 
incurred voluntarily or in compliance 
with another standard, and the 
incremental costs attributable to the 
new requirements associated with this 
rulemaking. The rationale or basis for 
assigning these compliance costs would 
also assist OSHA in developing accurate 
cost estimates. 
One commenter, the Fragrance 
Materials Association of the United 
States, stated that its best assessment is 
that it would take anywhere from two to 
eight hours to review information and 
prepare new labels and safety data 
sheets for each hazardous chemical. 
(Document ID # 0061). Another 
commenter, the Flavor and Extract 
Manufacturers Association of the United 
States, also reported that it would take 
from two to eight hours to review the 
necessary information and produce new 
labels and safety data sheets for each 
hazardous chemical. (Document ID # 
0062). 
One company that produces and 
distributes about 4,000 different 
hazardous chemicals estimated that it 
will take four to six hours per product 
to prepare a GHS SDS. (Document ID # 
0026). 
The National Paint and Coatings 
Association stated that it would take 
approximately five hours to research the 
information for a product SDS/label at 
a small company, at a cost of about $300 
per product; it also estimated that, at a 
medium-sized company, this same task 
would take from 3–5 days to 3 weeks at 
a cost of approximately $1,000 to 
$1,800, and that at a larger company, the 
task would be even more expensive. 
(Document ID # 0050). 
The National Association of Chemical 
Distributors estimated that converting 
an existing SDS to the new GHS format 
would require about 150 hours as 
compared to about 100 hours currently 
to revise an MSDS. (Document ID # 
0060). 
Another commenter, Merck, which 
produces, imports, or distributes about 
500 hazardous chemicals annually, 
estimated that, on average, it takes 
approximately 3 weeks to generate a 
single safety data sheet at an average 
cost of $1,500. Merck also stated that 
with a sufficient transition period of 
three to six years, the costs of moving 
to GHS would be minimal. Merck noted 
that the time and cost for additional 
changes to the GHS format should be 
minimal because it had already 
converted its SDSs to the 16-section 
ANSI/GHS format several years ago. 
(Document ID # 0072). 
One trade association estimated that 
the costs associated with revising SDSs 
and labels for the 1,600 firms in the 
cleaning product formulator industry 
would total $575 million, not including 
the time needed to review changes to 
hazard classifications. The total 
numbers of SDSs per establishment are 
generally higher for the establishments 
represented by the trade association 
than the OSHA estimates for the 
industry category as a whole. 
(Document ID # 0032). 
This trade association also provided 
some of the details underlying its cost 
estimates for individual companies. 
Cost estimates provided by the trade 
association for individual companies 
included costs per SDS as low as $30 
and $80, and as high as $600 or more. 
One company (identified as Company 
#11) estimated the cost to revise the 
label and SDS would be $120 per 
product; another company (Company 
#2) estimated that this cost would be 
$2,600 per product. Some of the higher 
compliance cost estimates appear to be 
unrealistically high; for example, the 
estimated costs associated only with 
revising labels for company #3 appear to 
represent about 3 percent of total annual 
sales. While acknowledging that some 
firms may incur higher costs than others 
to revise SDSs and labels, these data 
generally appear to support that, at least 
for several firms in the industry, the 
costs minimally necessary to achieve 
compliance would be close to or less 
than the costs estimated by OSHA. 
Several other commenters provided 
cost estimates related to the adoption of 
GHS requirements for chemical 
classifications and revisions to safety 
data sheets and labels. See, for example, 
Document ID #s 0015, 0018, 0024, 0036, 
0079, 0105, 0107, 0116, 0128, 0141, and 
0145, among others. Many estimates are 
broadly consistent with OSHA’s 
estimates; in addition, some estimates 
appear to be similar to, but may actually 
be substantially lower than, OSHA’s 
estimates to the extent they include 
costs attributable to the existing

15 This annualized estimate of $42 million reflects 
total costs of $490 million multiplied by 0.085332 
to annualize these costs (incurred over the first two 
years) over a 20-year period. The $490 million is 
equal to $5.9 million for health and safety managers 
(5,900 affected managers × $1000 per manager) plus 
$16.4 million for logistics personnel in 
manufacturing (43,600 affected logistics persons × 
8 hours × $47 per hour) plus $116 million for health 
and safety supervisors in manufacturing (309,000 
affected health and safety supervisors in 
manufacturing × 8 hours × $47 per hour) plus 
$351.7 million for health and safety supervisors in 
non-manufacturing (3,740,000 affected H&S 
supervisors in non-manufacturing × 2 hours × $47 
per hour). 
The annualization factor, 0.085332, is equal to: 
[(1⁄2] * [ (1¥(1.07)¥2)/0.07] * [0.07/ 
((1¥(1.07)¥20)], 
where the first term in brackets reflects the fact

standard rather than just the 
incremental costs associated with the 
proposed modifications. Other estimates 
are substantially higher, but many of 
these also appear to represent gross 
costs associated with fulfilling hazard 
communication requirements without 
consideration of the incremental nature 
of the compliance costs for the proposed 
revisions, as discussed above. 
OSHA requests additional comments 
and information from affected 
establishments and from the public 
regarding the nature of the incremental 
costs of classifying chemicals and 
modifying SDSs and labels associated 
with the proposed revisions. Comments 
would be most helpful to the Agency if 
they included the underlying data and 
methodology used to develop the cost 
estimates. 
Management Familiarization and Other 
Management-Related Costs 
The implementation of GHS as part of 
the OSHA HCS would require that 
employees currently covered by the 
standard become familiar with the new 
system. The nature and extent of the 
familiarization required would vary 
depending on an employee’s job and 
business. OSHA considered separately 
various training needs that may be 
imposed by the proposed revisions. 
Although it would not be explicitly 
required by the proposed revisions, 
some establishments may choose to 
provide training to managers and other 
employees that are not directly covered 
by the training requirements of the HCS. 
Other management-related costs may 
include revisions, if necessary, to 
existing hazard communication 
programs; promoting awareness of and 
providing information about the 
revisions to hazard communication 
programs; coordinating and integrating 
changes to hazard communication 
programs with other programs, 
processes, and functions; serving as an 
in-house resource for supporting the 
general adoption of GHS; creating 
supplemental capacity for providing 
training and assistance to affected 
employees; and other ancillary costs for 
company-specific changes and general 
hazard communication program 
administration that may be incurred at 
some establishments. 
These costs could be considered 
discretionary in that they would not be 
explicitly required by the proposed 
regulatory provisions; however, OSHA 
recognizes that these costs may be 
incurred in practice due to the manner 
in which some companies have 
implemented and integrated hazard 
communication programs in their 
facilities. The particular circumstances 
that would cause these costs to be 
incurred partly reflect the fact that 
hazard communications programs often 
are not implemented solely for purposes 
of complying with the OSHA standard, 
but may serve a variety of other 
purposes that are part of and that benefit 
the overall production process. 
In some cases, health and safety 
supervisors, logistics personnel, and 
other personnel involved in 
administering, implementing, and 
ensuring compliance with the 
requirements of the HCS in affected 
establishments would be expected by 
company managers to become familiar 
with the proposed revisions. The 
responsibilities of these employees may 
include modifying written hazard 
communication programs as necessary, 
reviewing and preparing training 
materials, and training new and existing 
employees regarding the changes. An 
estimated 8 hours of time, or an 
equivalent cost, would be associated 
with the necessary familiarization and 
implementation of revisions to hazard 
communication programs in affected 
establishments in the manufacturing 
sector. 
In many potentially affected 
establishments that do not produce 
SDSs, and that have few affected 
chemicals or few affected employees, a 
very basic hazard communication 
program may achieve compliance with 
the OSHA standard. For these 
establishments, outside of the 
manufacturing sector, that have a health 
and safety supervisor, the incremental 
management and administrative costs 
associated with the proposed revisions 
to the OSHA standard were estimated to 
be 2 hours per establishment. For 
establishments outside of the 
manufacturing sector that do not have a 
health and safety supervisor, OSHA 
estimated that these costs would be 
negligible. 
Based on the preceding analysis, 
OSHA estimates an annualized cost of 
approximately $42 million for 
management familiarization and other 
related management activities in 
response to GHS.15 
OSHA requests additional comments 
and information from affected 
establishments and from the public 
regarding the nature of the incremental 
management familiarization costs 
associated with the proposed revisions. 
Costs Associated With Training 
Employees 
Production employees who are 
currently covered by and trained under 
the provisions of the existing HCS 
would need to receive some additional 
training to become familiar with the 
proposed changes to SDSs and labels. 
In many potentially affected 
establishments that do not produce 
SDSs, and that have few affected 
chemicals or few affected employees, a 
very basic hazard communication 
program may achieve compliance with 
the OSHA standard. In these 
establishments, the incremental 
employee training costs associated with 
the proposed revisions to the OSHA 
standard may be relatively small. In 
other cases, employers may be able to 
integrate the necessary training into 
existing training programs and other 
methods of distributing safety and 
health information to employees, and 
thus may not incur much additional 
cost. Nevertheless, in order to 
adequately reflect the opportunity costs 
of devoting time and resources to the 
necessary training, and in order to 
ensure that the estimated compliance 
costs reflect an adequate emphasis on 
the familiarization with the proposed 
new hazard communication system, a 
more substantial training cost was 
estimated. 
An estimated 30 minutes of training, 
in addition to training that would 
otherwise be received, would provide 
adequate time for employees to become 
familiar with the new system. For some 
occupations for which the use of 
hazardous chemicals is minimal and the 
number of hazards for which training is 
needed is small, OSHA estimated that 
15 minutes of training would be 
sufficient. For some occupations in the 
transportation sector, where GHS 
pictograms are already in use, OSHA 
estimated that only 5 minutes of 
training would be needed. A complete 
occupation-by-occupation review of 
OSHA’s estimates is provided in the 
PP&E report.

50337 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
16 This annualized estimate of $44 million reflects 
total costs of $519 million multiplied by 0.085332 
to annualize these costs (incurred over the first two 
years) over a 20-year period. The $519 million is 
equal to $444 million in employee hours to receive 
training (40.6 million affected employees × 0.42 
hours × $26 per hour) plus $75 million in 
management hours to provide the training (3.8 
million managers × 0.42 hours × $47 per hour). The 
0.42 hours is the average estimated training time for 
all affected employees, with most receiving 30 
minutes of training, some receiving 15 minutes of 
training, and a very few receiving 5 minutes of 
training. The total number of managers providing 
training (3.8 million) would, on average, be equal 
to approximately 9.4 percent of the number of 
employees receiving training in response to GHS. 
The training costs associated with the 
proposed revisions are expected to be 
incurred during the transition to the 
new hazard communication system. 
Compliance with the proposed revisions 
is not expected to involve any 
additional training costs after the 
transition period. 
Based on the preceding analysis, 
OSHA estimates that the annualized 
cost of training employees in response 
to GHS would be approximately $44 
million.16 
The proposed revisions may result in 
reductions in the costs associated with 
providing training for employees as 
required by the existing OSHA HCS. 
Affected companies could save 
considerable time and effort in training 
new employees in the future. The 
savings may be attributable in part to 
reducing or eliminating the need to 
explain the different types of formats 
used to convey hazard information and 
the different types of information 
included in the contents of SDSs and 
labels. OSHA did not quantify these 
potential savings in training costs 
associated with the proposed revisions. 
OSHA requests additional comments 
and information from affected 
establishments and from the public 
regarding the nature of the incremental 
training costs associated with the 
proposed revisions. 
Summary of Unit Cost Estimates 
The following list provides a 
summary of the input estimates 
underlying the calculation of the 
compliance costs. It should be noted 
that these costs are intended to reflect 
only the incremental costs that would 
be incurred in addition to the associated 
costs that would be incurred in the 
absence of the proposed revisions to the 
standard. Except for employee training, 
these costs would apply only to those 
businesses not already in compliance 
with the proposed revisions. OSHA 
requests comments and information 
from the public regarding these 
estimates. 
Reclassifying chemicals and 
modifying SDSs and labels: 
• Large establishments (over 500 
employees): An average of 3 hours per 
SDS; in addition, for 95 percent of 
establishments, an average of $200 per 
SDS for software modifications. 
• Medium establishments (100–499 
employees): An average of 5 hours per 
SDS; in addition, for 25 percent of 
establishments, an average of $200 per 
SDS for software modifications. 
• Small establishments (1–99 
employees): An average of 7 hours per 
SDS. 
Management familiarization and other 
costs: 
• Eight hours for health and safety 
managers and logistics personnel in the 
manufacturing sector. 
• Two hours for each hazard 
communication program manager not in 
the manufacturing sector. 
Employee training: 
• 30 minutes per production 
employee in most industries; 
• 15 minutes in occupations exposed 
to few hazardous chemicals and types of 
hazards; 
• 5 minutes per employee in some 
occupations where GHS-type 
pictograms are already in use. 
Appendix to Section F: Total Non- 
annualized Costs of Compliance 
Table VII–4 shows the total non- 
annualized (non-discounted) 
compliance costs by industry and by 
cost element that are estimated to be 
incurred during the three-year phase-in 
of the proposed revisions. Except for 
employee training, these estimates 
include no costs for businesses already 
in compliance with the proposed 
revisions. 
As shown in Table VII–4, the total 
cost of compliance with the proposed 
rulemaking over the course of the 
transition period of three years is 
estimated to be about $1.14 billion. This 
amount also represents the total non- 
annualized cost of compliance for the 
proposed rule. Of this amount, the cost 
of chemical hazard reclassification and 
revision of SDSs and labels is an 
estimated $132 million, the cost of 
training employees is an estimated $519 
million, and the cost of management 
familiarization and other costs such as 
updates to hazard communication 
programs is an estimated $490 million.

BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
G. Economic Feasibility and Impacts 
This section presents OSHA’s analysis 
of the potential economic impacts of the 
proposal and an assessment of economic 
feasibility. A separate analysis of the 
potential economic impacts on small 
entities (as defined in accordance with 
the criteria established by the Small 
Business Administration) and on very 
small entities (those with fewer than 20 
employees) is presented in the following 
section as part of the Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Screening Analysis, 
conducted in accordance with the 
criteria laid out in the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
In order to assess the nature and 
magnitude of the economic impacts 
associated with compliance with the 
proposal, OSHA developed quantitative 
estimates of the potential economic 
impact of the requirements on each of 
the affected industry sectors. The 
estimated costs of compliance presented 
in Section F of this economic analysis 
were compared with industry revenues 
and profits to provide a measure of 
potential economic impacts. 
Table VII–5 presents data on revenues 
and profits for each affected industry 
sector, along with the corresponding 
estimated annualized costs of 
compliance in each sector. Potential 
impacts in the table are represented by 
the ratios of compliance costs to 
revenues and compliance costs to 
profits. 
As is evident from the data and 
estimates presented in Table VII–5, the 
costs of compliance for the proposal are 
not large in relation to the 
corresponding revenues and profits in 
each of the industry sectors. The 
estimated costs of compliance represent 
about 0.0004 percent of revenues and 
about 0.00712 percent of profits on 
average across all entities; compliance 
costs do not represent more than 0.02 
percent of revenues or more than 0.3 
percent of profits in any individual 
industry sector. 
The Agency preliminarily concludes 
that the proposal is economically 
feasible for the affected industries. In 
general, the courts have held that a 
standard is economically feasible if 
there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
estimated costs of compliance ‘‘will not 
threaten the existence or competitive 
structure of an industry, even if it does 
portend disaster for some marginal 
firms’’ (United Steelworkers of America 
v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1272 (D.C. 
Cir. 1980)). The potential impacts of 
employer costs associated with 
achieving compliance with the proposal 
fall well within the bounds of economic 
feasibility in each industry sector. 
OSHA does not expect compliance with 
the requirements of the proposal to 
threaten the viability of employers or 
the competitive structure of any of the 
affected industry sectors. 
The economic impact of the proposal 
is most likely to consist of a very small 
increase in prices for affected hazardous 
chemicals, of about 0.0004 percent on 
average. Chemical manufacturing 
companies, all of whom must incur the 
costs of compliance unless they are 
already doing so, should be able to pass 
through costs to customers. The 
additional costs of a one-time change to 
revised SDS and labeling criteria are 
extremely small in relation to the value 
of the corresponding products, and 
there are generally no economic 
substitutes, or alternatives, that would 
not be subject to the same requirements. 
It is unlikely that a price increase of this 
magnitude would significantly alter the 
types or amounts of goods and services 
demanded by the public or any other 
affected customers or intermediaries. If 
the compliance costs of the proposal can 
be substantially recouped with a 
minimal increase in prices, there would 
be little or no effect on profits.

produced and sold by the entity. 
The price elasticity of demand refers 
to the relationship between changes in 
the price charged for a product and the 
resulting changes in the demand for that 
product. A greater degree of elasticity of 
demand implies that an entity or 
industry is less able to pass increases in 
costs through to its customers in the 
form of a price increase and must absorb 
more of the cost increase through a 
reduction in profits. 
In the case of cost increases that may 
be incurred due to the requirements of 
the proposal, all businesses within each 
of the covered industry sectors would be 
subject to the same requirements. Thus, 
to the extent potential price increases 
correspond to costs associated with 
achieving compliance with the 
standards, the elasticity of demand for 
each entity will approach that faced by 
the industry as a whole. 
Given the small incremental increases 
in prices potentially resulting from 
compliance with the proposed 
standards and the lack of readily 
available substitutes for the products 
and services provided by the covered 
industry sectors, demand is expected to 
be sufficiently inelastic in each affected 
industry to enable entities to 
substantially offset compliance costs 
through minor price increases without 
experiencing any significant reduction 
in revenues or profits. 
OSHA expects the economic impact 
of the proposed rulemaking to be both 
an increase in the efficiency of 
production of goods and services and an 
improvement in the welfare of society. 
First, as demonstrated by the analysis 
of costs and benefits associated with 
compliance with the requirements of the 
proposal, OSHA expects that societal 
welfare will increase as a result of these 
standards, as the benefits exceed the 
necessary compliance costs. The 
proposal is estimated to yield net 
benefits of over $500 million annually 
that would be achieved in a cost- 
effective manner. 
Second, until now, many of the costs 
associated with the injuries, illnesses, 
and fatalities resulting from the risks 
addressed by the proposal have been 
externalized. For example, the costs 
incurred by society to supply certain 
products and services that are 
accompanied by injuries, illnesses, or 
fatalities from employee exposure to 
hazardous chemicals have not been 
fully reflected in the prices of those 
products and services. To the extent that 
fewer of these costs are externalized 
because of improved employer and 
employee information about hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace, the price 
mechanism will enable the market to 
produce a more efficient allocation of 
resources. However, reductions in 
externalities by themselves do not 
necessarily increase efficiency or social 
welfare unless the costs of achieving the 
reductions (including indirect and 
unintended consequences of regulatory 
approaches) are outweighed by the 
associated benefits, as they are in this 
instance. 
In addition, based on an analysis of 
the costs and economic impacts 
associated with this rulemaking, OSHA 
preliminarily concludes that the effects 
of the proposal on employment, wages, 
and economic growth for the United 
States would be negligible. The effects 
on international trade are expected to be 
small but not negligible, because of the 
increased import and export 
opportunities with U.S. trading partners 
arising from harmonization of the U.S. 
system with GHS. Hence, the primary 
effect on international trade is likely to 
be beneficial. 
OSHA requests comments from the 
public regarding these preliminary 
conclusions and requests information 
on whether and how much this proposal 
would affect international trade. 
Statement of Energy Effects 
As required by Executive Order 
13211, and in accordance with the 
guidance for implementing Executive 
Order 13211 and with the definitions 
provided therein as prescribed by the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), OSHA has analyzed the 
proposed standard with regard to its 
potential to have a significant adverse 
effect on the supply, distribution, or use 
of energy. 
As a result of this analysis, OSHA has 
determined that this action is not a 
significant energy action as defined by 
the relevant OMB guidance. 
H. Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Screening Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, as 
amended in 1996, requires the 
preparation of an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) for proposed 
rules where there would be a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small firms. (5 U.S.C. 601– 
612). Under the provisions of the law, 
each such analysis shall contain: 
1. A description of the impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities; 
2. A description of the reasons why 
action by the agency is being 
considered; 
3. A succinct statement of the 
objectives of, and legal basis for, the 
proposed rule; 
4. A description of and, where 
feasible, an estimate of the number of 
small entities to which the proposed 
rule will apply; 
5. A description of the projected 
reporting, recordkeeping and other 
compliance requirements of the 
proposed rule, including an estimate of 
the classes of small entities which will 
be subject to the requirements and the 
type of professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record; 
6. An identification, to the extent 
practicable, of all relevant Federal rules 
which may duplicate, overlap or 
conflict with the proposed rule; and 
7. A description and discussion of any 
significant alternatives to the proposed 
rule which accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and 
which minimize any significant 
economic impact of the proposed rule 
on small entities, such as 
(a) The establishment of differing 
compliance or reporting requirements or 
timetables that take into account the 
resources available to small entities; 
(b) The clarification, consolidation, or 
simplification of compliance and 
reporting requirements under the rule 
for such small entities; 
(c) The use of performance rather than 
design standards; and 
(d) An exemption from coverage of 
the rule, or any part thereof, for such 
small entities. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act further 
states that the required elements of the 
IRFA may be performed in conjunction 
with or as part of any other agenda or 
analysis required by any other law if 
such other analysis satisfies the relevant 
provisions. 
While a full understanding of OSHA’s 
analysis and conclusions with respect to 
costs and economic impacts on small 
businesses requires a reading of the 
complete PEA and its supporting 
materials, this IRFA will summarize the 
key aspects of OSHA’s analysis as they 
affect small businesses. 
1. A Description of the Impact of the 
Proposed Rule on Small Entities. 
The proposed regulation would 
require classification of chemicals, 
especially chemical mixtures, somewhat 
different from current hazard 
determination methods; a standardized 
format for the organization of MSDSs 
(now called SDSs); standardized labels 
and standardized pictograms; and 
training for affected employees on these 
changes. (Some commenters argued that 
GHS would also impose more stringent 
testing requirements, but as explained 
in Section V of the preamble, the HCS

does not currently require testing of 
chemicals, and will not require testing 
with adoption of the GHS.) 
For the purpose of its cost analysis, 
OSHA estimated three types of cost: 
(1) Costs to chemical producers of 
classifying chemicals, reformatting 
SDSs, and developing new labels; 
(2) Costs for safety and health 
managers and logistics personnel to 
familiarize themselves with the 
standard (although not required by the 
regulation, this is a necessary step in its 
implementation); and 
(3) Costs of training affected 
employees on how to find the 
information they need on SDSs and to 
comprehend pictograms and standard 
labels. 
OSHA believes that each of these is a 
one-time cost that would be incurred 
during the three-year transition period 
after the final rule is published. OSHA 
anticipates that, once the final rule is 
implemented, the costs under GHS will 
be equivalent to the costs under the 
existing HCS system. In other words, 
once chemical producers and 
distributors set up for and shift to the 
GHS system, OSHA expects there will 
be no additional costs arising from the 
proposed rule for classification, SDSs, 
and labeling. 
OSHA also anticipates that, after the 
three-year transition period, the 
familiarization costs for health and 
safety managers, logistics personnel, 
and emergency response planners and 
the training costs for affected employees 
will be lower under the uniform GHS 
system than under the existing HCS 
system. (However, in its estimates of 
economic impacts, OSHA has not 
included any cost savings for the 
expected lower training costs.) 
OSHA welcomes comments on these 
points, which are critical to OSHA’s 
economic analysis of costs, benefits, and 
economic impacts. 
OSHA’s criteria for determining 
whether there are significant economic 
impacts on a substantial number of 
small firms are that, for any given 
industry, the annualized costs as a 
percentage of revenues do not exceed 1 
percent and that the annualized costs as 
a percentage of profits do not exceed 5 
percent. All of OSHA’s calculations of 
the economic impacts on small firms 
totally ignore any offsetting benefits of 
any kind, even though OSHA estimates 
that, for most small firms, the benefits 
of this rule will actually exceed the 
costs. 
OSHA’s industry-by-industry 
analysis, both for small firms as defined 
by SBA and for very small firms with 
fewer than 20 employees, shows that in 
no industry size class do the annualized 
costs exceed 0.013 percent of revenues 
or 0.4 percent of profits. For affected 
small firms as defined by SBA, the 
average annualized cost per firm of the 
proposed rule would be $16 per year. In 
terms of chemical producing industries 
only, the average annualized cost per 
small firm as defined by SBA would be 
$452 per year. For affected firms with 
fewer than 20 employees, the average 
annualized cost per firm of the proposed 
rule would be $12 per year, and the 
average annualized cost per firm that 
produces chemicals would be $167 per 
year. 
Given these results, OSHA concludes 
that the proposed rule will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small firms. Thus, 
an IRFA is not required for this 
rulemaking. However, recognizing the 
possible value that such an analysis may 
provide, OSHA has voluntarily included 
the elements of the IRFA as part of this 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Screening 
Analysis (IRFSA) and has analyzed the 
potential impact of the proposed 
revisions on small entities. As described 
in Section D of this economic analysis, 
the proposed revisions to HCS, on the 
whole, are expected to result in 
significant net benefits to employers, as 
the associated cost savings outweigh the 
corresponding compliance costs. The 
underlying analysis included the effects 
on small entities, and this conclusion 
generally applies to the small entities 
affected by the proposed rule. 
In order to ensure that any potential 
significant adverse impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
would be appropriately considered, 
OSHA also specifically evaluated the 
impact on small entities of the costs of 
compliance alone, without regard to the 
associated savings. 
The total annualized cost of 
compliance with the proposal for small 
entities is estimated to be approximately 
$63 million, as shown by industry in 
Table VII–6. 
To assess the potential economic 
impact of the proposal on small entities, 
OSHA calculated the ratios of 
compliance costs to profits and to 
revenues. These ratios are presented for 
each affected industry in Table VII–6. 
OSHA expects that among small entities 
potentially affected by the proposal, the 
average increase in prices necessary to 
completely offset the compliance costs 
would be 0.0009 percent. The average 
price increase necessary to completely 
offset compliance costs would not 
exceed 0.02 percent among small 
entities in any single affected industry 
sector. 
In the event that no costs could be 
passed through, the compliance costs 
could be completely absorbed through 
an average reduction in profits of less 
than 0.02 percent. In most affected 
industries the compliance costs could 
be completely absorbed through an 
average reduction in profits of less than 
0.05 percent; the reduction would be no 
more than 0.4 percent in any of the 
affected industries. 
To further evaluate the potential for 
any adverse effects on small entities 
resulting from the proposal, OSHA 
assessed the short-term impacts that 
may be associated with the compliance 
costs during the transition period.

per year for three years. Thus, the 
potential temporary impact would be 
about 0.003 percent of revenues or about 
0.1 percent of profits, on average, per 
year for three years. 
In order to further ensure that 
potential impacts on small entities were 
fully analyzed and considered, OSHA 
also separately examined the potential 
impacts of the proposed standard on 
very small entities, defined as those 
with fewer than 20 employees. As 
shown in Table VII–7, the total 
annualized costs for entities in this size 
class would be an estimated $40 
million. The annualized costs represent 
about 0.001 percent of revenues and less 
than 0.03 percent of profits. The total 
non-annualized compliance costs for 
very small entities during the three-year 
transition period are estimated to be 
$463 million, or about $154 million per 
year for three years. Thus, the potential 
temporary impact would be less than 
0.005 percent of revenues or 0.15 
percent of profits, on average, per year 
for three years. 
In order to more carefully focus on the 
industry sectors most likely to have 
significant economic impacts, OSHA 
carefully examined those industries in 
the chemical manufacturing and 
petroleum and coal products 
manufacturing sectors (‘‘chemical and 
petroleum producers’’) that produce 
chemicals and SDSs. OSHA examined 
the extent to which these firms might 
have significant economic impacts if 
they produced an unusually high 
number of chemical products requiring 
SDSs. 
To examine this issue, OSHA 
examined all small chemical and 
petroleum producers with respect to 
their costs as a percentage of revenues 
and profits. Using the same cost 
estimation methods as the base analysis, 
OSHA estimated how many separate 
chemical products a small firm would 
have to produce for its annualized costs 
of compliance with the proposed rule to 
exceed 5 percent of profits. OSHA found 
that the firm would have to produce 
3,385 distinct chemical products, each 
requiring its own SDS. OSHA thinks it 
very unlikely that there are substantial 
numbers of small firms (with an average 
of 27 employees) that produce 3,385 or 
more distinct chemical products. 
Swedish data show that less than 0.1 
percent of all firms (including large 
firms) in Sweden produce more than 
500 distinct chemical products. 
(Swedish Chemical Agency, http:// 
www.kemi.se/templates/ 
Page____4268.aspx, 2007 data.) 
OSHA conducted a similar analysis 
for very small firms with fewer than 
twenty employees. This analysis found 
that such firms, with an average of 4.7 
employees, would need to produce 
more than 140 distinct chemical 
products for costs to exceed 5 percent of 
profits. OSHA estimates that this would 
be a very rare situation. 
Further, even if small firms could be 
found that produce more than 3,385 
chemical products and very small firms 
that produce more than 140 chemical 
products, the costs would probably be 
much lower than OSHA estimates. First, 
firms producing this many distinct 
products probably would not produce 
SDSs and labels by hand, as OSHA 
assumes most small firms do, but would 
instead invest in appropriate software to 
lower their costs, as most larger firms 
do. Second, firms producing large 
numbers of chemical products 
commonly do so because they sell a 
variety of different mixtures. Once 
appropriate data for the ingredients of 
these mixtures had been developed, 
using the bridging principles outlined in 
Appendix A of the preamble, small 
firms developing SDSs and labels for 
each mixture would take far less than 
the 7 hours per chemical product that 
OSHA has estimated for small firms to 
convert to the GHS system.

impacts as a result of producing a very 
large number of chemical products. 
OSHA remains concerned with the 
possible problems of small and very 
small firms that might produce very 
large numbers of distinct chemical 
products. OSHA welcomes comments 
on the issue of whether there are small 
and very small firms that produce a very 
large number of products, what 
industries they are in, and their 
anticipated costs to convert to the GHS 
system. 
2. A description of the reasons why 
action by the agency is being 
considered. 
OSHA’s HCS was first adopted in 
1983 for manufacturing (48 FR 53280). 
Later the Agency expanded the scope of 
coverage to include all industries where 
employees are potentially exposed to 
hazardous chemicals (52 FR 31852). 
The HCS requires chemical 
manufacturers and importers to evaluate 
the hazards of the chemicals they 
produce or import. The rule provides 
definitions of health and physical 
hazards to use as the criteria for 
determining hazards in the evaluation 
process. The information about the 
hazards and protective measures is then 
required to be conveyed to downstream 
employers and employees by putting 
labels on containers and preparing and 
distributing safety data sheets. All 
employers with hazardous chemicals in 
their workplaces are required to have a 
hazard communication program, 
including container labels, safety data 
sheets, and employee training. 
Ensuring that this information is 
available in workplaces helps employers 
design and implement appropriate 
controls for chemical exposures, and 
gives employees the right-to-know and 
the knowledge of the hazards and 
identities of the chemicals, as well as 
allowing them to participate actively in 
the successful control of exposures. 
Together, these actions of employers 
and employees reduce the potential for 
adverse effects to occur. The 
information transmitted under the HCS 
requirements provides the foundation 
upon which a chemical safety and 
health program is built in the 
workplace. Without this information, 
appropriate controls could not be 
identified and implemented. 
OSHA’s HCS is designed to 
disseminate information on chemicals 
to precipitate changes in handling 
methods and thus protect those exposed 
to the chemical from experiencing 
adverse effects. To protect employees 
and members of the public who are 
potentially exposed to chemicals during 
their production, transportation, use, 
and disposal, a number of countries 
have developed laws that require 
information about those chemicals to be 
prepared and transmitted to affected 
parties. These laws vary with regard to 
the scope of chemicals covered, 
definitions of hazards, the specificity of 
requirements (e.g., specification of a 
format for safety data sheets), and the 
use of symbols and pictograms. The 
inconsistencies between the various 
laws are substantial enough that 
different labels and safety data sheets 
must often be used for the same product 
when it is marketed in different nations. 
For example, Canada has established 
requirements for labels under its 
Workplace Hazardous Materials 
Information System (WHMIS). WHMIS 
requires that labels include specified 
symbols within a defined circle. U.S. 
chemical manufacturers must label their 
chemicals accordingly for marketing in 
Canada. 
Development of multiple sets of labels 
and safety data sheets for each product 
when shipped to different countries is a 
major compliance burden for chemical 
manufacturers, distributors, and 
transporters involved in international 
trade. Small businesses may have 
particular difficulty in coping with the 
complexities and costs involved, and it 
has been argued that these differing 
requirements may be a technical (non- 
tariff) barrier to trade. 
These concerns led, in June 1992, to 
a mandate from the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) (Chapter 19 of 
Agenda 21), supported by the U.S., 
calling for development of a globally 
harmonized chemical classification and 
labeling system. The negotiations were 
extensive and spanned a number of 
years. The product resulting from this 
effort, the Globally Harmonized System 
of Classification and Labeling of 
Chemicals, was formally adopted by the 
new United Nations Committee of 
Experts on the Transport of Dangerous 
Goods and the Globally Harmonized 
System of Classification and Labeling of 
Chemicals in December 2002. 
The proposed modifications to the 
HCS incorporate the GHS’s 
requirements. They would require 
chemical manufacturers to apply new 
hazard classification criteria to their 
chemicals and to prepare and distribute 
new labels and safety data sheets. 
Further, these SDSs and labels would be 
standardized in a way that they are not 
under the existing hazard 
communication standard. OSHA’s 
current performance-based approach to 
SDSs and labeling can create confusion 
among those who seek to use hazard 
information effectively. For example, 
labels and safety data sheets may 
include symbols and hazard statements 
that are unfamiliar to readers or not well 
understood. This lack of standardization 
and the absence of pictograms are 
particularly a problem for U.S. workers 
not literate in English. Containers may 
be labeled with such a large volume of 
information that important statements 
are not easily recognized. 
OSHA believes that adoption of these 
new requirements would benefit 
employers and enhance employee 
safety. Employers who use chemicals, 
and exposed employees, would benefit 
from receiving the revised labels and 
safety data sheets prepared in a 
consistent format. The information 
should be easier to comprehend and 
access in the new approach, allowing it 
to be used more effectively for the 
protection of employees. The primary 
effect in workplaces where chemicals 
are used but not produced would be to 
integrate the new approach into the 
workplace hazard communication 
program, including assuring that both 
employers and employees understand 
the pictograms and other information 
provided on the chemicals. 
OSHA believes that adoption of the 
GHS would improve labels and SDS 
comprehensibility through 
implementation of a standardized 
approach. The current regulatory system 
includes a performance-oriented 
approach to labels and SDSs, allowing 
the producers to use whatever language 
or format they choose to provide the 
necessary information. This results in a 
lack of consistency that makes it 
difficult for users of chemicals to 
properly identify their hazards and 
protective measures, particularly when 
purchasing the same product from 
multiple suppliers. Having the 
information provided in the same words 
and pictograms on labels, as well as 
having a standardized order of 
information on SDSs, would help all 
users, including employers, employees, 
and safety and health responders, more 
easily identify the critical information 
necessary to protect employees. 
In addition, American employees and 
employers should receive benefits from 
the international adoption of GHS. 
Development of the GHS system 
required extensive work by a great 
number of people, and resources from 
many countries and organizations. The 
reason it received such support is that 
there is a belief that there are significant 
benefits associated with implementation 
of a globally harmonized approach to 
hazard communication. Countries, 
international organizations, chemical 
producers, and users of chemicals 
would all benefit. There are at least four

reasons to expect that GHS will be 
adopted globally. 
First and foremost, implementation of 
the GHS would enhance protection of 
humans and the environment. 
Occupationally related injuries, 
illnesses, and fatalities remain a serious 
problem in the U.S. For example, 
although likely to contain very 
significant underreporting, data from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate 
that, in 2007, employees suffered an 
estimated 55,400 illnesses attributable 
to chemical exposures (BLS, 2008), and 
that some 17,340 chemical-source 
injuries and illnesses involved days 
away from work (BLS, 2009). As shown 
in the preliminary economic analysis, 
the adoption of the proposed revisions 
is expected to result in a significant 
reduction in injuries, illnesses, and 
fatalities among U.S. employees 
exposed to hazardous chemicals. In 
addition, while some countries, such as 
ours, already have the benefits of 
protection under existing systems, the 
majority of countries do not have such 
comprehensive approaches. Thus, 
implementation of the GHS would 
provide these countries with the 
important protections that result from 
dissemination of information about 
chemical hazards and protective 
measures. In our country, we expect to 
improve and build on protections we 
already have. 
Second, implementation of such an 
approach would facilitate international 
trade in chemicals. It would reduce the 
burdens caused by having to comply 
with differing requirements for the same 
product, and allow companies who do 
not have the resources to deal with 
those burdens to be involved in 
international trade. 
Third, one of the initial reasons this 
system was pursued internationally 
involved concerns about animal welfare 
and the proliferation of requirements for 
animal testing and evaluation. Existing 
systems with different definitions of 
hazards often result in duplicative 
testing to produce data related to the 
varying cut-offs in the different systems. 
Having one agreed definition would 
reduce this duplicative testing. It should 
be noted, however, that OSHA has never 
had testing requirements. The HCS is 
based on collecting and evaluating the 
best available existing evidence on the 
hazards of each chemical. 
Fourth, information transmittal 
systems provide the underlying 
infrastructure for the sound 
management of chemicals in a country. 
Those countries that do not have the 
resources to develop and maintain such 
a system can use the GHS to build their 
chemical safety and health programs. 
Since it has been developed, and will be 
maintained, through an international 
approach, national resources to 
accomplish chemical safety and health 
can be streamlined. Unlike some other 
issues, a country’s approach to the 
sound management of chemicals 
definitely affects others countries. In 
some cases, bordering countries may 
experience pollution and other effects of 
uncontrolled chemical exposures. In all 
countries, there is a need to acquire 
sufficient information to properly 
handle the chemical when it is imported 
from other countries. Thus having a 
coordinated and harmonized approach 
to the development and dissemination 
of information about chemicals would 
be mutually beneficial to importing and 
exporting countries. 
In the U.S., there are four primary 
regulatory agencies that exercise 
jurisdiction over chemical hazard 
communication: OSHA; the Department 
of Transportation, which regulates 
chemicals in transport; the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission, which 
regulates consumer products; and the 
Environmental Protection Agency, 
which regulates pesticides and has other 
labeling authority under the Toxic 
Substances Control Act. These agencies 
are not domestically harmonized in 
terms of definitions of hazards and other 
requirements. If all four agencies adopt 
the GHS, the U.S. would have the 
additional benefit of harmonizing the 
overall U.S. approach to classification 
and labeling. Since most chemicals are 
produced in a workplace and shipped 
elsewhere, nearly every employer deals 
with at least two sets of Federal 
requirements. Thus every producer 
would be likely to experience some 
benefits from domestic harmonization. 
OSHA has made a preliminary 
determination that the proposed 
revisions would improve the quality 
and consistency of information 
provided to employers and employees 
regarding chemical hazards and 
associated protective measures. The 
Agency anticipates this improved 
information would enhance the 
effectiveness of the HCS in ensuring that 
employees are apprised of the chemical 
hazards to which they are exposed, and 
in reducing the incidence of chemical- 
related occupational illnesses and 
injuries. OSHA preliminarily estimates 
that (1) savings in benefits from 
improved employee health and safety 
exceed the costs of the proposed rule, 
and (2) cost savings to chemical users 
exceed the costs of the proposed rule. 
An additional and more complete 
discussion of the reasons why this 
standard is being proposed by the 
Agency is provided in other parts of the 
preamble section of this Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). 
3. Statement of the objectives of, and 
legal basis for, the proposed rule. 
The primary objective of the proposed 
revisions to the OSHA HCS is to achieve 
the potential benefits of the OSHA HCS 
in a more comprehensive, efficient, and 
effective manner. The revisions are 
expected to provide an increased degree 
of occupational safety and health for 
employees exposed to hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace. 
Another objective of the proposed 
revisions is to provide updated, clear, 
and comprehensive standards regarding 
the classification of chemical hazards 
and the manner in which relevant 
information about chemical hazards is 
disseminated to affected employees. 
The intent of the HCS is to ensure that 
the hazards of all chemicals are 
evaluated and that information 
concerning chemical hazards and 
associated protective measures is 
transmitted to employers and 
employees. The standard achieves this 
goal by requiring chemical 
manufacturers and importers to review 
available scientific evidence concerning 
the physical and health effects of the 
chemicals they produce or import to 
determine if they are hazardous. 
For every chemical found to be 
hazardous, the chemical manufacturer 
or importer must develop a container 
label and an SDS and provide both to 
downstream users of the chemical. All 
employers with employees exposed to 
hazardous chemicals must develop a 
hazard communication program and 
ensure that exposed employees are 
provided with labels, access to SDSs, 
and training on the hazardous chemicals 
in their workplace. 
The three information components in 
this system—labels, SDSs, and 
employee training—are all essential to 
the effective functioning of the program. 
Labels provide a brief, conspicuous 
summary of hazard information at the 
site where the chemical is used. SDSs 
provide detailed technical information 
and serve as a reference source for 
exposed employees, industrial 
hygienists, safety professionals, 
emergency responders, health care 
professionals, and other interested 
parties. Training is designed to ensure 
that employees understand the chemical 
hazards in their workplace and are 
aware of protective measures to follow. 
Labels, SDSs, and training are 
complementary parts of a 
comprehensive hazard communication 
program—each element reinforces the 
knowledge necessary for effective 
protection of employees.

Information provided in accordance 
with the HCS serves to reduce the 
incidence of chemical-related illnesses 
and injuries in the workplace. This is 
accomplished by modifying the 
behavior of both employers and 
employees. Providing information to 
employers enables them to implement 
protective measures in the workplace. 
Less hazardous alternatives may be 
chosen, or appropriate engineering 
controls, work practices, and personal 
protective equipment can be selected. 
Improved understanding of chemical 
hazards by supervisory personnel 
results in safer handling of hazardous 
substances, as well as proper storage 
and housekeeping measures. 
Employees provided with information 
and training on chemical hazards are 
able to fully participate in the protective 
measures instituted in their workplaces. 
Knowledgeable employees can take the 
steps required to work safely with 
chemicals in their workplace and are 
able to determine what actions are 
necessary if an emergency occurs. 
Information on chronic effects of 
exposure to hazardous chemicals helps 
employees recognize signs and 
symptoms of chronic disease and seek 
early treatment. Information provided 
under the HCS also enables health and 
safety professionals to provide better 
services to exposed employees. Medical 
surveillance, exposure monitoring, and 
other services are enhanced by the ready 
availability of health and safety 
information. 
OSHA believes that the 
comprehensive approach adopted in the 
HCS, which includes requiring 
evaluation of chemicals and the 
transmittal of information through 
labels, SDSs, and training, is sound. 
This proposed rule does not alter that 
approach. Rather, the proposed rule is 
intended to improve the effectiveness of 
the HCS by enhancing the quality and 
consistency of the information provided 
to employers and employees. OSHA 
believes this can be accomplished by 
revising the requirements of the 
standard to conform to the more specific 
and detailed provisions of the GHS for 
classification, labeling, and SDSs. 
The legal basis for the rule is the 
responsibility given the Department of 
Labor through the Occupational Safety 
and Health (OSH) Act of 1970. The OSH 
Act authorizes and obligates the 
Secretary of Labor to promulgate 
mandatory occupational safety and 
health standards as necessary ‘‘to assure 
so far as possible every working man 
and woman in the Nation safe and 
healthful working conditions and to 
preserve our human resources.’’ 29 
U.S.C. 651(b). The OSH Act gives the 
Agency authority to issue and revise 
standards and regulations to further this 
goal. A thorough discussion of the legal 
basis can be found in the preamble to 
the proposed standard in Section VI— 
Pertinent Legal Authority. 
4. Description of and estimate of the 
number of small entities to which the 
proposed rule will apply. 
OSHA has completed a preliminary 
analysis of the impacts associated with 
this proposal, including an analysis of 
the type and number of small entities to 
which the proposed rule would apply, 
as described above. In order to 
determine the number of small entities 
potentially affected by this rulemaking, 
OSHA used the definitions of small 
entities developed by the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) for each 
industry. 
The proposed standard would impact 
firms that are the primary producers or 
distributors of hazardous chemicals, and 
firms whose employees are exposed to 
hazardous chemicals. Based on the 
definitions of small entities developed 
by SBA for each industry, the proposal 
is estimated to potentially affect a total 
of 4,215,404 small entities, as shown in 
Table VII–6. The rule would have its 
greatest impacts on the 72,000 small 
firms that produce chemicals that 
require SDSs and labels. 
5. Description of the projected 
reporting, recordkeeping and other 
compliance requirements of the 
proposed rule. 
The proposed standard includes 
revised criteria for classification of 
chemical hazards; revised labeling 
provisions that include requirements for 
use of standardized signal words, 
pictograms, and hazard statements; a 
specified format for safety data sheets; 
and related revisions to definitions of 
terms used in the standard, employee 
information and training requirements, 
and other sections of HCS. 
The preamble to the proposed 
standard provides a comprehensive 
description of, and further detail 
regarding, the compliance requirements 
of the proposed rulemaking. A 
description of the types of entities 
which would be subject to the new and 
revised requirements, and the types of 
professional skills necessary for 
compliance with the requirements, is 
presented in the relevant sections of this 
economic analysis and the 
corresponding supporting research, and 
is summarized below with a summary of 
unit costs. Except for employee training, 
these costs would apply only to those 
businesses not already in compliance 
with the proposed revisions. OSHA 
requests comments and information 
from the public regarding these 
estimates: 
Reclassifying chemicals and 
modifying SDSs and labels: 
• Medium establishments (100–499 
employees): an average of 5 hours per 
SDS; in addition, for 25 percent of 
establishments, an average of $200 per 
SDS for software modifications. 
• Small establishments (1–99 
employees): an average of 7 hours per 
SDS. 
Management familiarization and 
other costs: 
• Eight hours for health and safety 
managers and logistics personnel in the 
manufacturing sector. 
• Two hours for each hazard 
communication program manager not in 
the manufacturing sector. 
Employee training: 
• 30 minutes per production 
employee in most industries; 
• 15 minutes in occupations exposed 
to few hazardous chemicals and types of 
hazards; 
• 5 minutes per employee in some 
occupations where GHS-type 
pictograms are already in use. 
6. Federal rules which may duplicate, 
overlap or conflict with the proposed 
rule. 
OSHA has not identified any other 
Federal rules which may duplicate, 
overlap, or conflict with the proposal, 
and requests comments from the public 
regarding this issue. 
7. Alternatives to the proposed rule 
which accomplish the stated objectives 
of applicable statutes and which 
minimize any significant economic 
impact of the proposed rule on small 
entities. 
As discussed in Section IV, this 
rulemaking is unique for OSHA in that 
it seeks to improve employee 
protections by adopting an 
internationally harmonized approach to 
hazard communication issues. While 
the current HCS has provided 
protections for exposed workers by 
disseminating information about 
chemicals in their workplaces for many 
years now, the approach taken in the 
GHS strengthens and refines the system, 
and gives OSHA the opportunity to 
improve hazard communication by 
adopting it. The GHS has the same 
general concept of an integrated, 
comprehensive process of identifying 
and communicating hazards, but 
provides more extensive criteria to 
define the hazards in a consistent 
manner, as well as standardizes label 
elements and SDS formats to help to 
ensure that the information is conveyed 
consistently. 
OSHA has preliminarily concluded 
that required adoption of GHS is the

best approach to modifying the HCS to 
achieve the goals of global 
harmonization, ease of use, and 
improved health and safety. As 
addressed in Section XV of the 
preamble, many commenters supported 
the concept of OSHA moving forward to 
adopt the GHS. Several objected to 
adoption, and OSHA has identified and 
responded to their concerns in Section 
XV of the preamble as well. In addition, 
there were several commenters who 
noted that small chemical 
manufacturers that are not engaged in 
international trade of chemicals would 
have a large burden associated with 
adopting the GHS, and questionable 
benefits due to their lack of involvement 
in international trade. The Small 
Business Administration (SBA) 
suggested that OSHA ‘‘consider 
‘grandfathering’ or exempting small 
businesses that do not export regulated 
chemicals.’’ (Document ID # 0022) 
Others simply noted that they believed 
there would be high costs and limited 
benefits for such employers, or that it 
would be costly and difficult to adopt 
(Document ID #s 0015, 0026, 0178, and 
0144). There was no discussion in any 
of these comments about how this might 
work in the revised standard. 
None of these commenters suggested 
a detailed approach to exactly how such 
a grandfathering or exemptions might 
work. OSHA welcomes comments on 
how such approaches might work. 
A somewhat different alternative that 
might achieve the goals of those 
employers who anticipate high costs for 
little benefit to themselves would be for 
OSHA to consider simply facilitating 
the voluntary adoption of GHS. With 
some very minor exceptions that could 
easily be changed by rule, the existing 
HCS performance-based approach to 
MSDS would permit chemical 
producers and importers to use the 
proposed GHS SDS format and 
approach. They could not however, 
adopt the GHS classifications without a 
change to the rule allowing the use of 
GHS classifications where they differed 
from those in HCS. The use of labels 
adopting GHS signal words, 
precautionary statements, formats, and 
pictograms could be possible under the 
HCS performance-based approach to 
labels. However, it should be carefully 
noted that, although the resulting label 
might appear GHS compliant, it need 
not actually be GHS-compliant, and in 
some case would not be based on the 
GHS classifications. Further, individual 
firms could produce labels using GHS 
formats, etc., with meanings quite 
different from those in GHS. 
The advantages of a system that 
simply facilitated voluntary adoption of 
GHS are that (1) those engaged in 
international trade, whether as exporters 
or importers, could obtain the full 
benefits of international harmonization; 
(2) those producers of chemicals who 
saw no market advantage to changing 
systems would not need to incur the 
costs associated with changing their 
hazard classification, MSDSs, and labels 
and (3) it is possible that employee 
training under a performance-based 
system for MSDSs and labels would not 
need to be required or changed. 
OSHA sees a number of disadvantages 
to a rule that simply facilitates the 
voluntary adoption of GHS. First 
consider the issues of a common MSDS/ 
SDS format versus MSDS/SDS formats 
that can vary in any way whatsoever 
while meeting a standard of what an 
MSDS must contain. Such an approach 
would eliminate a proportion of the 
possible benefits from knowing where to 
look in an SDS for the information one 
wants or needs, since many SDSs will 
still not be standardized. 
From OSHA’s perspective, a key issue 
of concern in such an approach is that 
the classification criteria in the GHS are 
different from the hazard definitions in 
the current HCS. In general, as 
discussed in Section XV of the 
preamble, they cover the same scope of 
hazard, so these differences do not 
result in significant differences in the 
chemicals covered. But the GHS criteria 
divide most of the hazard classes into 
hazard categories that convey the 
severity of the effect, while few of the 
hazard definitions in the current HCS 
take this approach. The standardized 
label elements are associated with these 
specific hazard categories, i.e., the 
harmonized pictograms, signal words, 
and hazard statements are assigned by 
hazard category and reflect the degree of 
hazard it presents to those exposed. 
Likewise, the precautionary statements 
assigned are also reflective of the degree 
of hazard, with responses related to 
these presumed hazard levels. 
Third, consider the possible 
disadvantages of not having a common, 
well-understood labeling system with 
signal words, pictograms, precautionary 
statements and common formatting. In 
the absence of such a system it would 
be extremely difficult to teach persons 
not literate in English how to 
understand labels, and even those 
literate in English may have difficulty 
with major differences in the symbols 
and language used for the same 
substance or hazard. 
It should also be noted that allowing 
the voluntary use of GHS might not be 
considered GHS-compliant as the 
phrase is used in GHS publications. 
It is difficult to quantify the benefits 
and costs of the alternative of simply 
facilitating adoption of GHS. Part of the 
problem is that it is difficult to forecast 
the extent to which persons would 
voluntarily adopt GHS. OSHA therefore 
considered two scenarios. In the first 
scenario, there is no extensive adoption 
of GHS and GHS becomes simply a 
minor sub-class of the performance- 
oriented options already available. This 
scenario has the effect of minimizing the 
costs associated with the facilitation of 
voluntary adoption of GHS, but at the 
expense of minimizing the benefits of 
this alternative. In the second scenario, 
GHS would be adopted widely enough 
to become the norm for hazard 
communication, but some would 
continue their existing HCS approaches 
unchanged. Under this scenario, most 
firms would insist that their health and 
safety managers and logistics personnel 
be thoroughly familiar with GHS, and 
that employees be trained on GHS. This 
scenario minimizes the loss in benefits 
associated with the first scenario, but 
involves much greater costs than 
scenario 1 and may involve significantly 
increased costs over the option of full 
compliance with GHS. OSHA believes 
that the actual results will fall between 
these two scenarios and is seeking 
comment on the relative likelihood of 
these or other scenarios. 
OSHA suspects that second scenario 
might be the more likely possibility. For 
example, the standardized MSDS 
system adopted by GHS is widely used 
in the U.S., particularly by large firms 
and firms with many MSDSs, though 
many have not adopted this system. 
Domestic and international producers, 
and large and small producers are not 
mutually exclusive—a large business 
engaged in international trade can not 
simply implement the GHS regardless of 
its suppliers. Small businesses sell to 
large businesses. If small businesses do 
not adopt the GHS, then the large 
businesses would have to generate GHS 
classifications for chemicals they buy 
from them in order to follow the GHS. 
It would be difficult for them to do this, 
particularly for mixtures, since they are 
not the producer of the chemicals. This 
concept was addressed in comments 
regarding the effective dates for the rule, 
when many suggested it was not 
appropriate to differentiate dates based 
on the size of the business. For example, 
ORC Worldwide, Inc. stated (Document 
ID # 0123): 
OSHA should consider a company’s place 
in the manufacturing supply chain, not size, 
in determining how the phase-in is 
implemented. It would be sensible to start 
with producers of raw materials and basic 
chemicals. The technical information,

classification and categorization they perform 
will be useful downstream for the 
intermediate chemical producers and 
specialty chemical manufacturers. Lastly, the 
end user will benefit from the influx of 
information developed by the upstream 
professionals. 
Just as the size of the company may not 
be an appropriate criterion to determine 
when that company should be in 
compliance, it also does not appear to 
be a useful way to determine whether 
the GHS provisions should be adopted 
by them. It is difficult to determine how 
a voluntary system, or a system based 
on business size, would be successfully 
implemented and enforced given the 
structure of the supply system. Because 
of these factors, OSHA anticipates that 
many smaller firms who may think they 
do not need GHS may be forced through 
the market to adopt the system to satisfy 
the needs of customers who do engage 
in international trade. 
Under the first scenario, with no 
extensive voluntary adoption of GHS, 
the annualized costs $11 million per 
year for reclassification of chemicals 
and the $44 million in annualized costs 
for one-time retraining of workers 
would be largely eliminated. OSHA 
estimates that the $45 million in 
annualized costs for health and safety 
managers and logistics personnel to 
familiarize themselves with the GHS 
system would still be incurred. This 
alternative might add a continuing cost 
not present under either system of the 
need for new health and safety 
managers and logistics personnel to be 
familiar with both systems. Assuming a 
5 percent annual turnover among such 
professional, assuring continuing 
knowledge of both systems would add 
costs of $25 million per year. This 
alternative under Scenario 1 would thus 
reduce the costs from $97 million per 
year to between $42 million per year 
and $77 million per year depending on 
whether it is assumed that new health 
and safety managers and logistics 
personnel would need to be familiar 
with both systems. In return for this 
reduction in costs, under Scenario 1, 
because of the assumption of no 
significant adoption of GHS, the benefits 
of $851 million per year are also lost. 
Furthermore, this analysis ignores non- 
quantified benefits of full adoption of 
GHS, such as decreases in training costs 
associated a full GHS system. 
In choosing the voluntary adoption of 
GHS alternative, OSHA would be 
ignoring the potentially substantial 
health and safety benefits arising from 
the economically feasible (and, for most 
businesses, the economically desirable) 
option of full compliance with GHS and 
instead adopting a system with no such 
health and safety benefits for the sole 
reason of possibly saving a small 
minority of all affected businesses some 
costs. 
Under Scenario 2, with widespread 
voluntary adoption of GHS, more 
benefits would be achieved than under 
Scenario 1, but all the benefits available 
under the proposed rule would not be 
achieved, and OSHA believes there 
would be greater costs than under the 
option of requiring full compliance with 
GHS. However, if widespread adoption 
of GHS is to result in substantially 
higher benefits than under Scenario 1, 
then health and safety managers and 
logistic personnel would have to be 
fully familiar with both systems, and 
employees would also need to be 
trained on GHS as the primary system 
and not just as one of many 
performance-oriented options. Thus, 
Scenario 2 would save some portion of 
the $11 million in annualized costs per 
year spent by chemical producers for 
reclassification and modifying SDSs and 
labels. However, the full costs of 
management familiarization and one- 
time employee training would still need 
to be incurred. In addition continuing 
costs would have to be incurred for new 
health and safety managers and logistic 
personnel to familiarize themselves 
with two systems and for new 
employees to be trained on both 
systems. Assuming turnover of 5 
percent for manager and 20 percent for 
employees, the associated annual costs 
would be $150 million per year. Under 
Scenario 2, the alternative of facilitating 
voluntary adoption would achieve some 
portion of the benefits of GHS but with 
significantly greater costs—an 
additional $150 million per year for 
continuing GHS training of new 
employees and GHS familiarization for 
new health and safety managers and 
logistics personnel, offset by a very 
modest reduction in costs to chemical 
producers. 
In terms of benefits, both OSHA’s 
proposed full GHS compliant approach 
and that of a dual system would retain 
possible benefits to chemical producers 
and to international trade. However, 
OSHA is concerned that the confusions 
arising might negate some of the 
benefits associated with reduced 
injuries, illnesses and fatalities. While 
there would still be some situations 
where use of GHS would prevent 
injuries, there would also be situations 
where confusion and misunderstanding 
would lead to injuries, illnesses, and 
fatalities that might not otherwise be 
incurred. For example, employees used 
to seeing pictograms might easily make 
the false assumption that chemicals 
without a pictogram are safe. This has 
the potential to eliminate a significant 
portion of the annual health and safety 
benefits. Other benefits would also need 
to be reduced, though it is not clear by 
how much. 
In addition to the chosen alternative 
of full compliance with GHS, OSHA 
also considered options requiring full 
compliance with some but not all 
portions of GHS. One such option 
would be to adopt the provisions of the 
GHS that are presumed to provide the 
greatest benefits at the least cost. For 
example, OSHA could adopt the 
standardized label provisions without 
the associated hazard classification 
criteria. Employers would be free to 
continue to use the existing hazard 
determination scheme, but present the 
label information in the standardized 
form anticipated under the GHS. Since 
the standardized labels appear to be 
relatively inexpensive to implement, 
while reviewing classifications is more 
costly, this has the potential to reduce 
the overall cost of implementation of the 
revised rule. 
This option—adopting the label 
provisions but not the classification 
criteria—presents many of the same 
concerns. First, the reason the label 
provisions are relatively cost-efficient to 
adopt is that the GHS assigns the 
various required elements by hazard 
class and category. It is basically a 
cookbook approach. Once the 
classification or re-classification has 
been accomplished, the GHS provides 
the specific information for the label. 
Requiring this standardized approach 
to labeling without the infrastructure of 
the criteria would be more burdensome 
for the chemical manufacturer to 
accomplish, though OSHA could 
consider whether it would be 
appropriate to provide criteria for HCS 
classification under this alternative that 
would reduce burden. However, OSHA 
is also concerned that this alternative 
would result in labels that may look the 
same but which actually do not have 
consistent warnings based on the 
precise hazardous effect. Without the 
GHS criteria that breaks hazard classes 
into multiple categories for most effects, 
it would be difficult to relate the label 
elements to the hazard determinations 
under the current HCS. For example, the 
current standard treats all carcinogens 
the same way, rather than differentiating 
them into several categories. OSHA 
would either have to provide some type 
of decision logic to employers in order 
to have a consistent approach or allow 
the responsible party to determine the 
appropriate labeling elements that 
should be included on the label. The 
most protective approach would be to 
treat all carcinogens or other effects as

being in the most hazardous category of 
each class so there will be no choice of 
label elements that would cause 
differences among employers. 
Regardless, chemical producers will 
have to undergo an assessment of their 
current determinations and attempt to 
relate them to the established hazard 
categories. This will be difficult, 
particularly for small producers. 
Alternatively, OSHA could create a 
regulatory system assigning HCS 
categories to each GHS label, but this 
would be totally contrary to the 
performance-orientation of the current 
HCS system, as well as having 
undetermined costs. It is thus unlikely 
that this would provide significant 
savings relative to simply reviewing 
classifications for purposes of putting 
the chemicals into GHS classes and 
categories. 
However, apart from this burden, the 
benefits of standardized labeling would 
be reduced by not having common 
criteria upon which they are based. 
Chemical producers following this 
approach would likely not be able to use 
their labels in other countries where the 
GHS has been adopted. Hence, there 
would be costs of adoption without 
commensurate benefits in either 
comprehensibility or facilitation of 
trade. 
Another type of dual approach would 
have OSHA adopt some, but not all, of 
the label elements. In particular, the 
Agency might not adopt the exact 
language of the precautionary 
statements since this language has been 
codified but are not yet considered to be 
‘‘harmonized’’ under the GHS—they are 
provided for guidance and reference, 
but competent authorities may choose to 
implement other statements. The exact 
language for precautionary statements 
could be adopted later when they are 
harmonized under the GHS. 
Alternatively, OSHA could either allow 
label preparers to use whatever 
precautionary statements they deem 
appropriate or develop its own set of 
statements to require. 
The precautionary statements, 
however, are the part of the GHS label 
that provides the measures to follow to 
ameliorate the possible hazardous 
effects of exposure. Delaying adoption 
of the precautionary statements would 
likely reduce the effectiveness of the 
labels significantly, and reduce the 
appropriate information on the SDSs as 
well. Labels that lack a precautionary 
statement would not be fully 
harmonized. The second alternative, to 
simply require precautionary 
statements, but not to specify what they 
are, would provide some protection but 
would not correct the current situation 
of inconsistent precautions due to the 
performance-oriented approach that 
allows the label preparer to determine 
what they are or if they are included. 
One communication advantage of 
providing the information in the same 
language from label-to-label is that 
workers and other users can be assured 
that the same action is required. If you 
take a simple preventive measure such 
as ‘‘wash your hands,’’ but convey it in 
several different ways, the reader of the 
label could think you mean something 
different. This is one of the advantages 
of providing the text for these 
statements in the revised HCS. 
It should be noted that it appears that 
all of the commenters favoring an 
alternative of less than full compliance 
with GHS saw the primary benefits of 
adopting the GHS would be in 
facilitating international trade. As has 
been addressed throughout the PEA, 
however, OSHA has based the benefits 
of this action on improved 
communication to workers and to health 
and safety managers and logistics 
personnel resulting in improved safe 
handling of hazardous chemicals, not on 
the trade benefits which, while 
recognized, have not been quantified. 
Therefore, OSHA believes that any 
grandfathering or exemption related to 
this rule would result in some of these 
parties not obtaining the same level of 
benefits of increased comprehensibility 
as workers in other types and sizes of 
workplaces. 
OSHA welcomes comments on these 
issues, but in the absence of a clear case 
for one of the alternatives presented, 
OSHA will continue to consider the 
alternative proposed, full compliance 
with GHS by all U.S. firms, the best 
alternative. 
OSHA considered one other set of 
alternatives to the proposed rule: 
changing the proposed three-year 
duration of the phase-in. A shorter 
phase-in period was criticized by all 
commenters both because of feasibility 
issues and for radically increasing 
compliance costs. OSHA did examine 
the costs and benefits of a longer phase- 
in, over a five-year period, and found 
that the longer phase-in would lower 
annualized costs from $97 million to 
$88 million per year, but would also 
lower the annualize benefits from $851 
million per year to $693 million per 
year, with the ultimate effect of 
lowering net benefits. Even the lowering 
of costs may be somewhat illusory 
because these estimates do not take 
account of the additional confusion 
caused by having two different systems 
in place for an additional two years. 
I. Environmental Impacts 
The provisions of this proposal have 
been reviewed in accordance with the 
requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), the 
Council on Environmental Quality 
(CEQ) NEPA regulations (40 CFR parts 
1500–1508), and the DOL NEPA 
Procedures (29 CFR part 11). As a result 
of this review, OSHA has determined 
that the proposed standards would have 
no significant adverse effect on air, 
water, or soil quality, plant or animal 
life, use of land, or other aspects of the 
environment. OSHA anticipates that the 
more complete and easier-to-understand 
SDSs resulting from this proposal 
would, in addition to increasing 
employee health and safety, have 
positive effects on the environment. 
J. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Analysis 
Section 3 of the Occupational Safety 
and Health Act makes clear that OSHA 
cannot enforce compliance with its 
regulations or standards on the U.S. 
government ‘‘or any State or political 
subdivision of a State.’’ Under voluntary 
agreement with OSHA, some States 
enforce compliance with their State 
standards on public sector entities, and 
these agreements specify that these State 
standards must be equivalent to OSHA 
standards. Thus, although OSHA may 
include compliance costs for affected 
public sector entities in its analysis of 
the expected impacts associated with a 
proposal, the proposal would not 
involve any unfunded mandates being 
imposed on any State or local 
government entity. 
Based on the analysis presented in 
this preliminary economic analysis, 
OSHA concludes that the proposal 
would impose a Federal mandate on the 
private sector in excess of $100 million 
in expenditures in any one year. 
Accordingly, this preliminary economic 
analysis of the proposed revisions to the 
HCS constitutes the written statement 
containing a qualitative and quantitative 
assessment of the anticipated costs and 
benefits of the Federal mandate, as 
required under Section 202(a) of the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(2 U.S.C. 1532(a)). 
K. Sensitivity Analysis 
The methodology and calculations 
underlying the estimation of the 
compliance costs, benefits, and 
economic impacts associated with this 
rulemaking are generally linear and 
additive in nature. Thus, the sensitivity 
of the results and conclusions of the 
analysis will generally be proportional

to variations in the relevant input 
parameters. 
For example, if the estimated time 
that companies need to reclassify 
chemical hazards and revise SDSs and 
labels were doubled, the corresponding 
labor costs (but not software costs) of 
reclassification and revision of SDSs 
and labels would double as well. 
OSHA evaluated a series of such 
changes in input parameters to test 
whether and to what extent the general 
conclusions of the economic analysis 
held up. On the whole, OSHA found 
that the conclusions of the analysis are 
reasonably robust, as changes in any of 
the input parameters tend not to 
produce disproportionately large 
changes in the results. The results also 
show significant net benefits for the 
proposed rule regardless of the 
individual revisions to costs, benefits, or 
discount rate. The results of the 
individual sensitivity tests are 
summarized in Table VII–8 and are 
described in more detail below. 
In the sensitivity test where OSHA 
doubled the estimated time that 
companies need to reclassify chemical 
hazards and revise SDSs and labels, and 
estimates of other input parameters 
remained unchanged, as shown in Table 
VII–8, the estimated total costs of 
compliance would increase by $8 
million annually, or by about 8 percent, 
while net benefits would also decline by 
$8 million, from $754 million to $746 
million annually.

17 For this sensitivity analysis, OSHA calculated 
only the impact on costs of an increase in the 
number of SDSs. However, in principle, each 
additional SDS would yield future benefits due to 
improved efficiencies in creating and revising SDSs 
under GHS. Although not shown in Table VII–8, 
this effect would increase benefits by $8 million 
annually, more than offsetting the $5.5 million 
annual cost increase. 
corresponding estimated total cost of 
reclassification and revision of SDSs 
and labels increased by 50 percent as 
well. As shown in Table VII–8, if 
OSHA’s estimates of other input 
parameters remained unchanged, the 
total estimated costs of compliance 
would increase by $5.5 million 
annually, or by about 6 percent, while 
net benefits would also decline by $5.5 
million annually, from $754 million to 
$748 million annually.17 
In a third sensitivity test, when OSHA 
increased by 50 percent the estimated 
number of employees required to be 
covered by hazard communication 
programs and to be trained on GHS, the 
corresponding estimate of the total costs 
associated with training employees 
increased by 50 percent. As shown in 
Table VII–8, if OSHA’s estimates of 
other input parameters remained 
unchanged, the total estimated costs of 
compliance would increase by $22 
million annually, or by about 23 
percent, while net benefits would also 
decline by $22 million annually, from 
$754 million to $732 million annually. 
In a fourth sensitivity test, when 
OSHA doubled the estimated 
incremental amount of time necessary 
for training employees on GHS, the 
corresponding estimate of the total costs 
associated with training employees also 
doubled. As shown in Table VII–8, if 
OSHA’s estimates of other input 
parameters remained unchanged, the 
total estimated costs of compliance 
would increase by $44 million annually, 
or by about 45 percent, while net 
benefits would also decline by $44 
million annually, from $754 million to 
$710 million annually. 
OSHA also performed sensitivity tests 
on several input parameters used to 
estimate the benefits of the proposed 
rule. In one sensitivity test on benefits, 
OSHA reduced its estimate of health 
and safety benefits of the proposed rule 
from 1 percent to 0.5 percent of the 
benefits estimated for the existing HCS. 
As shown in Table VII–8, if OSHA’s 
estimates of other input parameters 
remained unchanged, the total 
estimated benefits of the proposed rule 
would decline by $133 million 
annually, or by about 16 percent, while 
net benefits would also decline by $133 
million annually, from $754 million to 
$610 million annually. 
In a second, parallel sensitivity test on 
benefits, OSHA increased its estimate of 
health and safety benefits of the 
proposed rule from 1 percent to 5 
percent of the benefits estimated for the 
existing HCS. As shown in Table VII–8, 
if OSHA’s estimates of other input 
parameters remained unchanged, the 
total estimated benefits of the proposed 
rule would increase by $1,064 million 
annually, or by about 125 percent, while 
net benefits would also increase by 
$1,064 million annually, from $754 
million to $1,818 million annually. 
In a third sensitivity test on benefits, 
OSHA reduced its estimate of savings 
due to the improved efficiency in 
creating and revising SDSs under GHS 
by 50 percent. As shown in Table VII– 
8, if OSHA’s estimates of other input 
parameters remained unchanged, the 
total estimated benefits of the proposed 
rule would decline by $8 million 
annually, or by about 1 percent, while 
net benefits would also decrease by $8 
million annually, from $754 million to 
$746 million annually. 
In a fourth sensitivity test on benefits, 
OSHA reduced its estimate of savings 
due to the improved efficiency of safety 
and health managers and logistics 
personnel by 67 percent. As shown in 
Table VII–8, if OSHA’s estimates of 
other input parameters remained 
unchanged, the total estimated benefits 
of the proposed rule would decline by 
$313 million annually, or by about 37 
percent, while net benefits would also 
decrease by $313 million annually, from 
$754 million to $441 million annually. 
OSHA also examined the effect of a 
change in the discount rate on the 
annualized costs and benefits. Changing 
the discount rate from 7 percent, used 
in the base case, to 3 percent would 
have the effect of lowering the costs to 
$73 million per year and increasing the 
benefits to $916 million per year. The 
result, as shown in Table VII–8, would 
be to increase net benefits by $89 
million per year, from $754 million to 
$843 million per year. 
OSHA also considered the sensitivity 
of its findings that the proposed rule is 
economically feasible and does not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Since the estimated potential negative 
impacts of the rulemaking are relatively 
small, these impacts would remain 
small even with relatively large changes 
in the input parameters. For example, 
even if the total estimated costs of 
compliance were increased by a factor 
of five, these costs would still represent 
less than 0.002 percent of revenues, and 
no industry or size class would have 
costs in excess of 5 percent of profits or 
1 percent of revenues. 
In conclusion, the sensitivity analysis 
demonstrates that even with relatively 
large variations in the input parameters, 
there would not be any 
disproportionately large changes in the 
estimates of compliance cost or benefits. 
Further, even if there were relatively 
large uncertainties in the estimates of 
compliance costs and benefits, there 
would still be a relatively high 
confidence in OSHA’s finding 
concerning economic feasibility, the 
certification that the standard will not 
have significant economic impacts on a 
substantial number of small firms, and 
the conclusion that the benefits exceed 
the costs. 
OSHA welcomes input from the 
public regarding all aspects of this 
sensitivity analysis, including any data 
or information regarding the accuracy of 
the preliminary estimates of compliance 
costs and benefit and how the estimates 
of costs, benefits, and economic impacts 
may be affected by varying assumptions 
and methodological approaches. 
VIII. OMB Review Under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
The proposed modifications to the 
Hazard Communication Standard would 
revise existing Hazard Communication 
collection of information (paperwork) 
requirements that are currently 
approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget (‘‘OMB’’) under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(‘‘PRA–95’’), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and 
OMB’s regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
The Paperwork Reduction Act defines 
‘‘collection of information’’ as ‘‘the 
obtaining, causing to be obtained, 
soliciting, or requiring the disclosure to 
third parties or the public of facts or 
opinions by or for an agency regardless 
of form or format.’’ (44 U.S.C. 
3502(3)(A).) OSHA has submitted the 
proposed revised Hazard 
Communication collection of 
information requirements identified in 
this NPRM to the OMB for review in 
accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d). 
As part of its continuing effort to 
reduce paperwork and respondent 
burden, the Department of Labor 
conducts a preclearance consultation 
program to provide the general public 
and Federal agencies with an 
opportunity to comment on proposed 
and continuing collections of 
information in accordance with the 
PRA–95 (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)). This 
program ensures that information is in 
the desired format, reporting burden 
(time and costs) is minimal, collections 
instruments are clearly understood, and 
OSHA’s estimate of burden is accurate. 
The Department notes that a Federal 
agency cannot conduct or sponsor a

collection of information unless it is 
approved by OMB under the PRA, and 
displays a currently valid OMB control 
number, and the public is not required 
to respond to a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. Also, notwithstanding 
any other provisions of law, no person 
shall be subject to penalty for failing to 
comply with a collection of information 
if the collection of information does not 
display a currently valid OMB control 
number. OSHA will publish a notice of 
OMB’s action at the final rule stage. 
OSHA solicits comments on the 
modified collection of information 
requirements and the estimated burden 
hours associated with these collections, 
including comments on the following: 
Æ Whether the proposed collection of 
information requirements are necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
Agency’s functions, including whether 
the information is useful; 
Æ The accuracy of OSHA’s estimate of 
the burden (time and cost) of the 
information collection requirements, 
including the validity of the 
methodology and assumptions used; 
Æ The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information collected; and 
Æ Ways to minimize the burden on 
employers who must comply, for 
example, by using automated or other 
technological techniques for collecting 
and transmitting information. 
The title, description of the need for 
and proposed use of the information, 
description of the respondents, and 
frequency of response of the information 
collections are described below, along 
with an estimate of the annual reporting 
burden and cost as required by 5 CFR 
1320.5(a)(1)(iv) and 1320.8(d)(2).

existing information collection 
requirements that are currently 
approved under OMB Control Number 
1218–0072 (Expiration Date: October 
2009). OSHA has submitted the 
proposed modification of the Hazard 
Communication Standard to OMB and 
has requested a new OMB control 
number addressing the proposed 
modification. OSHA will maintain OMB 
approval of the existing collections of 
information contained in the Hazard 
Communication Standard, under OMB 
Control Number 1218–0072. 
The proposed revisions to the OSHA 
Hazard Communication Standard would 
standardize the hazard communication 
requirements for products used in U.S. 
workplaces, and thus provide 
employees with consistent hazard 
communication information. Hazard 
communication is currently addressed 
by many different international, 
national, and State authorities. These 
existing requirements are not always 
consistent and often contain different 
definitions of hazards and varying 
provisions for what information is 
required on labels and safety data 
sheets. The proposed revisions would 
harmonize the U.S. system with 
international norms and therefore 
would facilitate international trade. The 
proposed modifications to the 
Standard’s collection of information 
requirements include: (1) Revised 
criteria for classification of chemical 
hazards; (2) revised labeling provisions 
that include requirements for use of 
standardized signal words, pictograms, 
hazard statements, and precautionary 
statements; (3) a specified format for 
safety data sheets; and (4) related 
revisions to definitions of terms used in 
the Standard and to requirements for 
employee training on labels and safety 
data sheets. 
Paragraph (d), ‘‘hazard classification,’’ 
requires chemical manufacturers and 
importers to evaluate chemicals 
produced in their workplaces or 
imported by them to classify their 
health and physical hazards in 
accordance with the Standard. For each 
chemical, the chemical manufacturer or 
importer must determine the hazard 
classes, and the category of each class, 
that apply to the chemical being 
classified. Employers are not required to 
classify chemicals unless they choose 
not to rely on the classification 
performed by the chemical 
manufacturer or importer for the 
chemical. Chemical manufacturers, 
importers or employers classifying 
chemicals must identify and consider 
the full range of available scientific 
literature and other evidence concerning 
the potential hazards. There is no 
requirement to test the chemical to 
determine how to classify its hazards. 
Mandatory Appendix A to § 1910.1200 
shall be consulted for classification of 
health hazards, and Mandatory 
Appendix B to § 1910.1200 shall be 
consulted for the classification of 
physical hazards. 
For mixtures, chemical 
manufacturers, importers, or employers 
evaluating chemicals must follow the 
procedures described in Appendixes A 
and B to § 1910.1200 to classify the 
hazards of the chemicals, including 
determinations regarding when 
mixtures of the classified chemicals are 
covered by the Standard. A chemical 
manufacturer or importer of a mixture is 
responsible for the accuracy of the 
classification of the mixture even when 
relying on the classifications for 
individual ingredients received from the 
ingredient manufacturers or importers 
on the safety data sheets. 
Paragraph (f) modifies existing label 
requirements by requiring more specific 
information. Paragraph (f)(1) requires 
chemical manufacturers, importers, or 
distributors to ensure that each shipped 
container of classified hazardous 
chemicals leaving the workplace is 
labeled, tagged, or marked with the 
following information: 
(i) Product identifier; 
(ii) Signal word; 
(iii) Hazard statement(s); 
(iv) Pictogram(s); 
(v) Precautionary statement(s); 
(vi) Name, address, and telephone 
number of the chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or other responsible party; and 
(vii) Supplemental information as 
appropriate. 
Information provided under (i) 
through (v) above must be in accordance 
with mandatory Appendix C, Allocation 
of Label Elements, for each hazard class 
and associated hazard category for the 
hazardous chemical; prominently 
displayed; and in English (other 
languages may also be included if 
appropriate). In addition, the 
information in (ii) through (iv) must be 
located together on the label, tag, or 
mark. 
For containers of hazardous chemicals 
that do not fall into one of the new 
hazard classes, (f)(2) requires that the 
label include the name of the chemical, 
the name, address, and telephone 
number of the manufacturer, importer, 
or other responsible party, and, as 
supplementary information, a 
description of the unclassified hazards 
and appropriate precautionary measures 
to ensure the safe handling and use of 
the chemical. 
For labels in the workplace, except as 
provided in paragraphs (f)(8) and (f)(9) 
of the Standard, employers must ensure 
that each container of hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace is labeled, 
tagged, or marked with either (i) the 
information specified under (f)(1)(i) 
through (v) for labels on shipped 
containers: or, (ii) product identifier and 
words, pictures, symbols, or 
combination thereof, which provide at 
least general information regarding the 
hazards of the chemicals, and which, in 
conjunction with the other information 
immediately available to employees 
under the hazard communication 
program, will provide employees with 
the specific information regarding the 
physical and health hazards of the 
hazardous chemical.

50380 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
OSHA is also proposing to update the 
language for workplace signs and labels 
to incorporate the GHS hazard statement 
and the applicable precautionary 
statement(s), where required. Most 
OSHA substance-specific health 
standards require hazard warning signs, 
usually for regulated areas, and the 
language required on the signs varies. 
With the GHS revision, these standards 
retain the requirements for specific 
warning language for specific signs; 
however, OSHA is proposing to modify 
the language to be compatible with GHS 
and consistent throughout the OSHA 
standards. The GHS classification 
process for a specific substance as 
proposed in this revision of the HCS 
will dictate the hazard warnings and the 
precautionary statements that will be 
required on the new GHS-compliant 
labels. OSHA believes that having signs 
and labels in the same formats and 
containing identical warnings for the 
same health effects will make it far 
easier for employers and employees to 
quickly recognize the hazard and the 
degree of danger of a hazard, thus 
enhancing communication. 
The proposal modifies the 
requirements for signs and labels found 
in the Agency’s health standards listed 
below. Since OSHA is providing 
specific language for signs and for labels 
on containers of contaminated clothing, 
waste and debris, the Agency is 
exempted from taking burden hours and 
costs for these provisions. (See 5 CFR 
1320.2(c)(2) (‘‘Controlling paperwork 
burden on the public’’)). The Agency is 
taking burden hours and costs for 
employers to label, tag, or mark each 
container of hazardous chemicals with 
either (i) the information specified 
under (f)(1)(i) through (v) for labels on 
shipped containers: or, (ii) product 
identifier and words, pictures, symbols, 
or combination thereof, which provide 
at least general information regarding 
the hazards of the chemicals.

Paragraph (g)(2) requires the chemical 
manufacturer or importer preparing the 
safety data sheet (SDS) to ensure that it 
is in English (although the employer 
may maintain copies in other languages 
as well), and include the following 
section numbers and headings, and 
associated information under each 
heading, in the order listed (see 
Appendix D to § 1910.1200—Safety Data 
Sheets, for the specific content of each 
section of the safety data sheet). 
(i) Section 1, Identification; 
(ii) Section 2, Hazard(s) identification; 
(iii) Section 3, Composition/ 
information on ingredients; 
(iv) Section 4, First-aid measures; 
(v) Section 5, Fire-fighting measures;

measures; 
(vii) Section 7, Handling and storage; 
(viii) Section 8, Exposure controls/ 
personal protection; 
(ix) Section 9, Physical and chemical 
properties; 
(x) Section 10, Stability and reactivity; 
(xi) Section 11, Toxicological 
information. 
Note 1 to paragraph (g)(2): To be 
consistent with the GHS, an SDS must also 
include the following headings in this order: 
Section 12, Ecological information; 
Section 13, Disposal considerations; 
Section 14, Transport information; and 
Section 15, Regulatory information. 
Note 2 to paragraph (g)(2): OSHA will not 
be enforcing information requirements in 
sections 12 through 15, as these areas are not 
under its jurisdiction. 
(xii) Section 16, Other information, 
including date of preparation or last 
revision. 
Paragraph (g)(5) requires the chemical 
manufacturer, importer or employer 
preparing the safety data sheet to ensure 
that the information provided accurately 
reflects the scientific evidence used in 
making the hazard classification. If the 
chemical manufacturer, importer or 
employer preparing the safety data sheet 
becomes newly aware of any significant 
information regarding the hazards of a 
chemical, or ways to protect against the 
hazards, this new information must be 
added to the safety data sheet within 
three months. If the chemical is not 
currently being produced or imported, 
the chemical manufacturer or importer 
must add the information to the safety 
data sheet before the chemical is 
introduced into the workplace again. 
Paragraph (g)(11) requires that 
employers ensure the safety data sheets 
are readily available, upon request, to 
designated representatives, the Assistant 
Secretary, and the Director, in 
accordance with the requirements of 29 
CFR 1910.1020(e). 
Affected Public: Business or other for- 
profit.

(202) 693–2222. 
IX. Federalism 
The Agency reviewed the proposed 
Hazard Communication Standard 
according to the Executive Order on 
Federalism (Executive Order 13132, 64 
FR 43255, August 10, 1999). This 
Executive Order requires that Federal 
agencies, to the extent possible, refrain 
from limiting State policy options, 
consult with States before taking actions 
that restrict their policy options, and 
take such actions only where there is 
constitutional and statutory authority to 
do so and the problem is of national 
significance. The Executive Order 
generally allows Federal agencies to 
preempt State law only where there is 
clear evidence of Congressional intent to 
allow it, or where the exercise of State 
authority would conflict with the 
exercise of Federal authority under a 
statute; in such cases, Federal agencies 
must limit preemption of State law to 
the extent possible. Section 18 of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act (the 
‘‘Act’’ or ‘‘OSH Act’’), 29 U.S.C. 667, 
expresses Congress’ clear intent to 
preempt State laws with respect to 
issues for which OSHA has promulgated 
an occupational safety and health 
standard under section 6 of the Act. 
Under section 18 of the Act, a State may 
avoid preemption only if it submits and 
obtains OSHA approval of an 
occupational safety and health plan. See 
Gade v. National Solid Wastes 
Management Association, 112 S. Ct. 
2374 (1992). 
With respect to States that do not 
have OSHA-approved plans, the Agency 
concludes that this proposal falls under 
the preemption provisions of the Act. 
Additionally, section 18 of the Act 
prohibits States without approved plans 
from issuing citations for violations of 
OSHA standards; the Agency finds that 
this proposed rulemaking does not 
expand this limitation. OSHA has 
authority under Executive Order 13132 
to propose a Hazard Communication 
Standard because the problems 
addressed by these requirements are 
national in scope. 
Section 18(c)(2) of the Act permits 
State-plan states to develop their own 
requirements to deal with any special 
workplace problems or conditions, 
provided, inter alia, these requirements 
are at least as effective as the Federal 
standards promulgated under section 6 
of the Act. Although a State standard 
becomes effective in accordance with 
State promulgation provisions, and is 
enforceable upon promulgation, OSHA 
must also review and approve the 
standard to assure that it is ‘‘at least as 
effective’’ as the Federal standard. 
OSHA intends to closely scrutinize 
State hazard communication standards 
submitted under current or future State 
plans to assure equal or greater 
effectiveness, including assurance that 
any additional requirements do not 
conflict with, or adversely affect, the 
effectiveness of the national application 
of OSHA’s standard. OSHA must 
determine in its review whether any 
State plan standard provisions that 
differ from the Federal provisions, when 
applicable to products distributed or 
used in interstate commerce, are 
‘‘required by compelling local 
conditions and do not unduly burden 
interstate commerce.’’ OSH Act section 
18(c), 29 U.S.C. 667(c). 
X. State Plans 
The 26 States and territories with 
their own OSHA-approved occupational 
safety and health plans must adopt 
comparable provisions within six 
months after the Agency publishes a 
final standard. These States and 
territories are: Alaska, Arizona, 
California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, 
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, 
Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, 
and Wyoming. Connecticut, New Jersey 
and New York have OSHA approved 
State Plans that apply to State and local 
government employees only. Each state- 
plan State’s existing requirements will 
continue to be in effect until it adopts 
the required revisions. 
XI. Unfunded Mandates 
Under Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 
1532, an agency must prepare a written 
‘‘qualitative and quantitative 
assessment’’ of any regulation creating a 
mandate that ‘‘may result in the 
expenditure by the State, local, and 
tribal governments, in the aggregate, or 
by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or 
more’’ in any one year before issuing a 
notice of proposed rulemaking. OSHA’s 
proposal does not place a mandate on 
State or local governments, for purposes 
of the UMRA, because OSHA cannot 
enforce its regulations or standards on 
State or local governments. (See 29 
U.S.C. 652(5).) Under voluntary 
agreement with OSHA, some States 
enforce compliance with their State 
standards on public sector entities, and 
these agreements specify that these State 
standards must be equivalent to OSHA 
standards. The OSH Act also does not 
cover tribal governments in the 
performance of traditional governmental 
functions, though it does when tribal 
governments engage in commercial 
activity. However, the proposal would 
not require tribal governments to 
expend, in the aggregate, $100,000,000 
or more in any one year for their 
commercial activities. Thus, although 
OSHA may include compliance costs for 
affected governmental entities in its 
analysis of the expected impacts 
associated with a proposal, the proposal 
does not trigger the requirements of 
UMRA based on its impact on State, 
local, or tribal governments. 
Based on the analysis presented in the 
Preliminary Economic Analysis (section 
VII above), OSHA concludes that the 
proposal would impose a Federal 
mandate on the private sector in excess 
of $100 million in expenditures in any 
one year. The Preliminary Economic 
Analysis constitutes the written 
statement containing a qualitative and 
quantitative assessment of the 
anticipated costs and benefits required 
under Section 202(a) of UMRA (2 U.S.C. 
1532). 
XII. Protecting Children From 
Environmental Health and Safety Risks 
Executive Order 13045 requires that 
Federal agencies submitting covered 
regulatory actions to OMB’s Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA) for review pursuant to Executive 
Order 12866 must provide OIRA with 
(1) an evaluation of the environmental 
health or safety effects that the planned 
regulation may have on children, and 
(2) an explanation of why the planned 
regulation is preferable to other 
potentially effective and reasonably 
feasible alternatives considered by the 
agency. Executive Order 13045 defines 
‘‘covered regulatory actions’’ as rules 
that may (1) be economically significant 
under Executive Order 12866 (i.e., a 
rulemaking that has an annual effect on 
the economy of $100 million or more, or 
would adversely effect in a material way 
the economy, a sector of the economy, 
productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or 
State, local, or tribal governments or 
communities), and (2) concern an 
environmental health risk or safety risk 
that an agency has reason to believe may 
disproportionately affect children. In 
this context, the term ‘‘environmental 
health risks and safety risks’’ means 
risks to health or safety that are 
attributable to products or substances

that children are likely to come in 
contact with or ingest (e.g., through air, 
food, water, soil, product use). The 
proposed HCS is economically 
significant under Executive Order 12866 
(see section VII of this preamble). 
However, after reviewing the proposed 
HCS, OSHA has preliminarily 
determined that the standard would not 
impose environmental health or safety 
risks to children as set forth in 
Executive Order 13045. 
XIII. Environmental Impacts 
The Agency reviewed the proposed 
Hazard Communication Standard 
according to the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the 
regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 
1500), and the Department of Labor’s 
NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). 
As a result of this review, OSHA has 
made a preliminary determination that 
the proposed HCS will have no impact 
on air, water, or soil quality; plant or 
animal life; or the use of land or aspects 
of the external environment. Therefore, 
OSHA concludes that the proposed HCS 
would have no significant 
environmental impacts. 
XIV. Public Participation 
OSHA encourages members of the 
public to participate in this rulemaking 
by submitting comments on the 
proposal. 
Written Comments. OSHA invites 
interested persons to submit written 
data, views, and arguments concerning 
this proposal. In particular, OSHA 
encourages interested persons to 
comment on the issues raised in section 
II of this preamble. When submitting 
comments, persons must follow the 
procedures specified above in the 
sections titled DATES and ADDRESSES. 
The comments must clearly identify the 
provision of the proposal you are 
addressing, the position taken with 
respect to each issue, and the basis for 
that position. Comments, along with 
supporting data and references, received 
by the end of the specified comment 
period will become part of the record, 
and will be available for public 
inspection and copying at the OSHA 
Docket Office as well as online at 
www.regulations.gov (Docket Number 
H022K–2006–0062). 
Informal Public Hearing. Pursuant to 
section 6(b)(3) of the Act, members of 
the public will have an opportunity to 
provide oral testimony concerning the 
issues raised in this proposal at informal 
public hearings. The hearings will be 
announced in the Federal Register. 
XV. Summary and Explanation of the 
Proposed Standard 
The advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking (ANPR) published by OSHA 
on September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53617) 
included a series of questions to solicit 
information on a number of specific 
topics. The responses from more than 
100 commenters have been used by the 
Agency to help prepare the required 
analyses for this rulemaking, as well as 
to make determinations regarding the 
proposed text. The discussion below on 
each paragraph of the proposed 
standard addresses the comments that 
were related to those subjects, and the 
discussion on the regulatory impact 
analysis in Section VII of this preamble 
refers to responses related to that topic. 
In addition to the responses to 
specific questions in the ANPR, OSHA 
has also received general comments 
covering topics such as statements of 
support for the rulemaking, approaches 
or principles to follow in the rule, 
suggestions for outreach and 
compliance assistance, and other 
subjects of concern. Before addressing 
the specific paragraphs of the proposed 
rule, we would like to discuss these 
general comments. 
Support for the rulemaking. Many of 
those who responded to the ANPR 
expressed their support for adoption 
and implementation of the GHS. The 
supporters far out numbered those who 
opposed or questioned adoption (see, 
e.g., Document ID #s 0003, 0007, 0047, 
0050, 0052, 0062, 0106, 0011, 0033, 
0038, 0123, 0130, 0151, 0163, and 
0171). The reasons presented for this 
support varied, but included the belief 
that adoption of the GHS will bring 
consistency and clarity to hazard 
communication (e.g., Document ID #s 
0046, 0059, 0081, and 0038); will help 
to ensure that employees have reliable, 
consistent, comprehensive and 
comprehensible information (e.g., 
Document ID #s 0054, 0030, 0037, and 
0124); will help to enhance human 
health and the environment (improved 
worker safety) (e.g., Document ID #s 
0064, 0081, 0032, and 0128); and will 
reduce burdens associated with 
preparing multiple classifications and 
labels for the same product (e.g., 
Document ID #s 0048, 0080, 0030, and 
0123). 
Support for implementation of the 
GHS by OSHA was expressed by both 
users and producers of chemicals. For 
example, the Aerospace Industries of 
America, Inc., representing companies 
that are generally large users of 
chemicals, identified many of these 
benefits in its statement of support 
(Document ID # 0054): 
AIA supports OSHA’s current efforts to 
adopt the GHS and its past participation in 
the development of the UN’s GHS for 
classification and communication of 
chemical hazards. We believe that the GHS 
adoption will help bring consistency and 
clarity to national and international 
regulation of hazardous chemicals and will 
help ensure that employers and employees 
have reliable, consistent, and comprehensive 
information on hazardous chemicals in the 
workplace. With the great diversity in the 
current systems of hazard communications 
globally, where MSDSs and chemical labels 
and classification systems vary in content 
details and length, type of information, 
format, and depth of hazard warnings and 
procedures, there is often inconsistency, 
redundancy, and incompatibility in labels 
developed by manufacturers and distributors. 
This often results in confusion for workers 
who try to interpret the MSDSs and labels, 
particularly across differing industry sectors 
and geographic areas where language, 
culture, and levels of experience and training 
may vary. OSHA’s proposal to adopt 
applicable provisions of the GHS into the 
U.S. workplace is a positive step in working 
toward developing standardized, uniform, 
classification, labeling, and related 
procedures for worker hazard 
communications systems. 
The United Parcel Service, Inc., also 
a user of chemicals as well as a 
transporter, supported implementation 
of the GHS too (Document ID # 0064): 
UPS is pleased to support OSHA’s 
adoption of the GHS and applauds the 
publication of the ANPRM as an important 
step toward implementation. We believe that 
the implementation of the GHS has the 
potential to (1) contribute to the safety of 
workers through standardized and more 
easily understood Safety Data Sheets 
(‘‘SDSs’’); (2) streamline domestic hazard 
classification and labeling across all 
pertinent U.S. agencies (OSHA, EPA, DOT, 
CPSC); and (3) facilitate international trade in 
chemical-based products by harmonizing 
hazard communication requirements across 
national borders. UPS also recognizes that 
the current HAZCOM standard, while not 
perfect, has helped promote the safety and 
health of American workers. We believe that 
OSHA can reap the benefits of the GHS 
without compromising the substantial 
benefits of the existing HAZCOM regime. 
The American Federation of Labor 
and Congress of Industrial 
Organizations (AFL–CIO), representing 
employees exposed to chemicals in the 
workplace, also recognized the value of 
revising the HCS to adopt the GHS 
provisions (Document ID # 0124): 
[T]he GHS offers a standardized and 
specific approach to the creation of labels 
and Safety Data Sheets (SDS), with a set 
format, content and order. Additionally, the 
GHS has an established set of hazard criteria 
and employs the use of standardized 
pictograms. We believe these elements of the 
GHS, when incorporated into the HCS, will 
assist greatly in generating labels and SDS’s

that are vastly more consistent and 
comprehensible in comparison to the current 
MSDS’s and labels. The improved 
consistency will also increase the ability to 
communicate the hazard information to 
workers. The AFL–CIO fully supports the 
efforts of OSHA to modify the HCS so that 
these objectives are realized. 
Similarly, DuPont, a major chemical 
manufacturer, also expressed its support 
for pursuing harmonization through 
adoption of the GHS (Document ID # 
0038): 
DuPont supports OSHA adoption of the 
GHS and the publication of this ANPRM as 
a concrete step towards implementation of 
the GHS in the United States. DuPont urges 
OSHA to use the information received in 
response to this ANPRM and move quickly 
and judiciously to the next step towards a 
globally harmonized system—publication of 
a proposed rule. DuPont believes that 
implementation of the GHS will mean that 
workers who must handle hazardous 
chemicals will find hazard information 
presented in a standardized and more 
comprehensible manner. DuPont also 
believes that implementation of the GHS will 
ultimately reduce the costs to businesses of 
classifying chemicals as to their hazards and 
creating warning labels and safety data 
sheets. 
While support for implementation of 
the GHS was widespread in the 
comments, these supporters also 
recognized the challenges associated 
with implementation. For example, it 
was noted by a number of commenters 
that there will be short-term costs 
associated with implementation, and 
they urged OSHA to take steps to 
minimize them by providing a 
reasonable time period for phase-in, 
coordinating with other agencies, and 
providing extensive outreach (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0032, 0111, 0155, 0157, 
and 0162). As will be addressed in other 
parts of this preamble, OSHA also 
recognizes the costs associated with 
implementation of the changes 
necessitated by adoption of the GHS, 
and has taken a number of steps to 
address them, including those 
recommended by these and other 
commenters. 
Others were concerned that the GHS 
is not completely harmonized because it 
allows countries and agencies within 
countries, to select from among a 
collection of building blocks when 
determining the scope of their 
requirements (e.g. Document ID # 0076). 
The GHS was designed in this manner 
because the existing systems all had 
scope accommodations for different 
sectors. For example, the most notable 
difference among sectors involves 
transport of dangerous goods and the 
workplace. In the transport sector, only 
those hazards which involve the types 
of exposures expected to be encountered 
in transport are covered. In the area of 
health effects, this has been defined as 
acute health effects, and the transport 
sector does not include any chronic 
health hazards in its coverage. 
Representatives of transport authorities 
involved in the negotiations indicated 
that this coverage was considered 
appropriate, and the building block 
concept that allowed them to continue 
to have that scope was necessary to 
include transport within the GHS. On 
the other hand, workplace authorities 
are concerned about chronic health 
hazards occurring as a result of 
workplace exposures, and expected the 
GHS to include those types of effects. 
Thus the GHS does not specify that all 
provisions should be applied to all 
sectors. 
However, as will be addressed below 
in specific paragraphs where this may 
be a concern, OSHA does not presently 
preclude employers from including 
additional information on labels and 
safety data sheets to address areas that 
are not covered by OSHA, and would 
not do so when implementing the 
proposed revisions. For example, where 
employers are preparing labels and 
SDSs for products that will be marketed 
in both the consumer and the workplace 
sector, additional information on acute 
toxicity at lower levels of concern may 
be included for the consumer sector 
without violating any current or 
proposed OSHA requirements. 
Similarly, information regarding 
transportation and environmental 
concerns may be included on SDSs 
required by OSHA. However, the 
Agency only enforces the standard with 
regard to the information required under 
its own provisions. The same situation 
would apply in implementation of the 
proposed revisions. 
In addition to those who supported 
implementation, but raised areas of 
concern regarding the way in which it 
is pursued, there were others who did 
not support implementation (Document 
ID #s 0004, 0065, 0068, and 0108). 
These commenters argued that it would 
be too financially burdensome 
(Document ID # 0004); delegates power 
to an international body which can only 
be accomplished through a treaty, if at 
all (Document ID # 0065); would change 
the current hazard communication 
scheme and thus potentially impair 
safety (Document ID # 0065); and 
should not be applied to pesticides 
because they are already heavily 
regulated (Document ID # 0108). 
With regard to the costs and economic 
impacts, OSHA has prepared extensive 
analyses of the costs, benefits, and 
economic impacts of the rules, which 
are summarized in Section VII of this 
preamble. The Agency has preliminarily 
concluded that the draft proposed 
standard is an economically significant 
rule under E.O. 12866 in that the costs 
exceed $100 million in each of the first 
three years. However, OSHA will certify 
that a regulatory flexibility analysis is 
not necessary under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA), because although 
the proposed standard will affect a 
substantial number of small firms, the 
impacts do not rise to the level of 
significance that would require a 
regulatory flexibility analysis under the 
RFA. 
Section VI of the preamble addresses 
the legal authority of the Agency to 
pursue this rulemaking. OSHA believes 
that adoption of the GHS through 
rulemaking is the appropriate 
mechanism to achieve this increased 
protection for exposed employees as 
well as global harmonization, and that 
a treaty is not the only means to 
accomplish this goal. More importantly, 
however, adoption of the GHS through 
rulemaking does not delegate ‘‘power to 
an international body’’ as argued by the 
National Association of Home Builders 
(Document ID # 0065). NAHB also 
argues that the proposal would allow 
hazard determinations ‘‘to be based on 
something other than fact and scientific 
evidence.’’ 
This rulemaking process is the legal 
means to modify the current HCS 
requirements to make them consistent 
with GHS. Promulgation of the GHS 
modifications and implementation of 
the revised HCS will be by OSHA under 
the Agency’s authority in the OSH Act. 
No international body will dictate the 
terms of the adoption. Moreover, there 
will be no international body with any 
authority in American workplaces with 
regard to hazard communication. 
Furthermore, the hazard determination 
process under the HCS is currently 
based on an evaluation of scientific facts 
and evidence, and would continue to be 
so under the revised HCS as proposed. 
The proposed revisions simply provide 
more extensive guidance on the 
scientific approach to hazard 
classification to help ensure a consistent 
evaluation process by multiple chemical 
manufacturers. As will be discussed in 
other parts of this preamble, OSHA 
believes that adoption of the GHS would 
lead to increased accuracy and 
reliability in evaluations of scientific 
evidence, and thus better information 
for employers and employees to use to 
protect them in the workplace. 
OSHA believes that arguments 
presented in this preamble, and the 
accompanying analyses, indicate that 
pursuing modifications to the HCS will

enhance employee protection, as well as 
ultimately facilitate compliance for all 
companies including those in the 
construction industry that use 
hazardous chemicals. 
Therefore, while OSHA did not 
include questions regarding the support 
of stakeholders for adoption of the GHS, 
it is clear that a majority of those 
responding to the ANPR support 
moving forward with the rulemaking. 
The arguments presented by those few 
who actively objected to adoption have 
been addressed in this preamble and the 
analyses for the rule, and have not been 
found persuasive. Other issues raised by 
supporters as concerns or suggestions 
for addressing concerns, have also been 
addressed in the proposed rule. While 
OSHA has addressed many of the 
identified issues in the proposal, the 
Agency recognizes that stakeholder 
input is needed to resolve some of the 
concerns, and these have been described 
in Section II. 
Other general issues. Commenters 
also raised a number of other issues 
related to the rulemaking that were not 
directed to specific paragraphs of the 
HCS. Some respondents indicated that 
OSHA should limit changes to the HCS 
to those required to align with the GHS, 
thus keeping the framework of the 
existing HCS (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0047, 0080, 0104, 0123, 0145, 0163, 
0167, and 0170). For example, ORC 
Worldwide (Document ID # 0123) 
stated: 
* * *[O]SHA can help minimize the cost 
to businesses by only modifying those 
sections of the OSHA Hazard 
Communication Standard (HCS) that must be 
changed to be consistent with GHS. 
Therefore, we strongly support OSHA’s 
stated intent to maintain the current scope, 
application, and interpretations of the HCS, 
and only modify those sections of the 
standard necessary for consistency with the 
GHS. Not only will this help minimize the 
implementation burden on industry, it 
should also serve to minimize confusion 
among employers and employees during the 
implementation period. 
As will be described in greater detail 
below with regard to specific 
provisions, OSHA has made every effort 
to maintain the framework of the 
current HCS in the proposed revisions. 
The modifications proposed are 
believed by OSHA to be those that are 
required to align the current HCS with 
the GHS, but do not address provisions 
of the current standard that are not 
addressed in the GHS. Thus, for 
example, the scope and application 
paragraph remains largely unchanged, 
as does the paragraph addressing trade 
secret protection. The primary 
modifications proposed in these 
paragraphs are changes in terminology 
required to ensure consistency. 
Many commenters also suggested that 
OSHA should coordinate 
implementation of the GHS with other 
Federal agencies. These included 
primarily EPA, DOT, and CPSC (see, e.g. 
Document ID #s 0048, 0050, 0053, 0076, 
0104, 0111, 0123, 0134, 0154, 0162, and 
0170). Others mentioned the Mine 
Safety and Health Administration 
(MSHA) (Document ID #s 0049, 0101, 
and 0111). For example, the Soap and 
Detergent Association (Document ID # 
0170) stated: 
SDA urges OSHA to coordinate 
implementation of revisions to the HCS 
related to the GHS with the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), Department of 
Transportation (DOT), and the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), which 
all have announced their intentions to 
implement GHS provisions in their 
regulations. Workplace hazard 
communication occurs in a stage of the 
overall life cycle of chemicals and finished 
products. Coordination and synchronization 
of implementation timing could greatly 
improve the efficiency of implementation of 
the GHS by industry. 
OSHA agrees with these commenters 
that the U.S. government agencies 
should continue to coordinate their 
activities with regard to implementation 
of the GHS. In terms of adopting the 
GHS provisions, DOT has substantially 
aligned the criteria for physical hazards 
in their regulations with those of the 
GHS under the HM–215I rulemaking (71 
FR 78595). EPA and CPSC have not 
initiated rulemaking on the GHS. Thus 
at this point, there is little to coordinate 
in terms of timelines. As rulemaking 
develops in these Agencies, discussions 
will continue to take place in the 
interagency committee on this subject. 
With regard to MSHA, Department of 
Labor rulemaking activities are 
coordinated through Department 
officials, and MSHA has been apprised 
of OSHA’s activities in order to 
determine what action may be 
appropriate for them to pursue in this 
area. 
A number of commenters also argued 
that OSHA should coordinate 
implementation with major U.S. trading 
partners (see, e.g., Document ID #s 0042, 
0048, 0101, 0116, 0128, 0141, 0155, and 
0170). Similarly, several argued that 
countries should limit modifications to 
the GHS that are country-specific, and 
that the UN process should be used to 
control such changes (Document ID #s 
0042, 0018, 0134, 0154, 0163, 0164, and 
0171). For example, the American 
Petroleum Institute (API) addressed 
these issues as follows (Document ID # 
0171): 
API strongly recommends that OSHA 
ensure that timing and coordination of GHS 
implementation schedules are in line with 
those of other countries, allowing sufficient 
time for companies to organize and 
accomplish necessary work. In order to 
achieve international harmonization of 
hazard communication materials and to 
avoid undue burden on companies, OSHA 
must stay engaged with all other actors to 
encourage even and consistent 
implementation of GHS by individual 
countries. Further, API recommends that 
OSHA work closely with other government 
agencies and countries to ensure alignment to 
the UN endorsed version of the GHS. As the 
implementation of the GHS by countries 
deviates from the UN version of GHS, the 
perceived benefits of harmonization 
substantially decrease. 
OSHA agrees with these commenters 
that coordination among trading 
partners would enhance harmonization 
and facilitate implementation. The 
Agency remains active in the UN 
process, participating in the 
Subcommittee of Experts on the GHS, as 
well as the UNITAR Programme 
Advisory Group. There is increased 
emphasis in the Subcommittee on 
implementation issues as well as 
coordination. OSHA led a 
correspondence group that reviewed 
implementation of the mixture 
classification provisions, and 
modifications to address concerns 
raised were incorporated into Revision 
3 of the GHS to help ensure consistency 
in approach. OSHA will continue to 
lead a correspondence group on 
practical classification and hazard 
communication issues. In addition, the 
Subcommittee has established a 
correspondence group to address 
broader implementation issues, and 
OSHA is participating in those 
deliberations as well. 
The Agency has also had bilateral 
discussions in the past with Canada, as 
well as the European Union (EU), on 
issues related to implementation. These 
are two of the key trading partners for 
the U.S. The EU has recently revised its 
overall approach to the regulation of 
chemicals in a new European 
Community Regulation (EC 1907/2006) 
referred to as REACH: Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorization and 
Restriction of Chemical substances. The 
new law entered into force on June 1, 
2007, and the provisions will be phased 
in over 11 years. REACH addresses 
chemical hazards over the life cycle of 
a chemical, and gives greater 
responsibility to industry to manage the 
risks from chemicals and to provide 
safety information on substances. 
Manufacturers and importers will be 
required to gather information on the 
properties of their chemical substances,

which will allow their safe handling, 
and to register the information in a 
central database run by the new 
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). 
The Agency will act as the central point 
in the REACH system: it will manage 
the databases necessary to operate the 
system, coordinate the in-depth 
evaluation of suspicious chemicals, and 
run a public database in which 
consumers and professionals can find 
hazard information. 
On September 3, 2008, the EU 
Parliament completed revisions to its 
longstanding chemical classification 
and labeling approach to align with the 
GHS (referred to now as the European 
Regulation on the Classification, 
Labelling, and Packaging of Substances 
and Mixtures). It applies to substances 
as of December 1, 2010, and mixtures as 
of June 1, 2015. The final version was 
published in the EU Official Journal on 
December 31, 2008. 
In terms of these proposed provisions, 
OSHA examined the European 
Commission’s regulation to coordinate 
where possible on approaches to 
implementation. However, the primary 
principles followed by OSHA in 
developing this proposal were to ensure 
that the modifications maintain or 
enhance the protections of the current 
standard, and that the modifications are 
consistent with the negotiated 
provisions of the GHS. 
One of the issues of concern regarding 
implementation by some other countries 
has been deviation from the GHS itself. 
Because GHS is intended to be globally 
implemented, efforts by countries to 
deviate in a collective manner from the 
GHS, rather than maintaining 
consistency, defeats the purpose, and 
consequently, lessens the benefits of the 
GHS. OSHA will continue to seek 
opportunities to ensure coordination of 
implementation and promote 
harmonization, both internationally and 
bilaterally. 
It should also be noted that the GHS 
is a living document, and the UN 
actively reviews it and considers 
possible changes based on 
implementation experiences and other 
information. These changes are made on 
a two-year cycle, referred to as a 
biennium. The OSHA proposal is based 
on Revision 3 of the GHS. Revision 3 
was adopted by the UN Subcommittee 
of Experts on the GHS (UNSCEGHS) in 
December 2008. A compilation of the 
approved changes is available on the 
UN Web site (ST/SG/AC.10/36/Add. 3), 
and the full text of Revision 3 will be 
accessible later this year. There are a 
number of clarifications and small 
modifications in Revision 3 that address 
inconsistencies or discrepancies in the 
previous text of the GHS, and these have 
been incorporated into this proposal. 
It is expected that as the UNSCEGHS 
fulfills its mandate to ensure that the 
GHS is up-to-date and relevant, further 
changes will be adopted on a biennium 
basis. If the change(s) is substantive and 
controversial, OSHA will have to engage 
in notice and comment rulemaking in 
order to amend the HCS. However, for 
non-substantive or clarification changes, 
OSHA has rulemaking options available 
that can be utilized to implement the 
changes and can be done more quickly 
than the full notice and comment 
rulemaking process. 
Two possible means are the 
Standards’ Improvement Process (SIPs) 
or a Direct Final Rule (DFR). Each of 
these options also gives the public 
notice and opportunity to comment, but 
has the advantage of a faster process. 
Either method could be used to ensure 
that the HCS remains current with the 
GHS. 
Outreach/Compliance Assistance. 
The ANPR included a series of 
questions to solicit input from the 
public on what outreach or compliance 
assistance materials would be 
appropriate and useful. OSHA received 
many comments in response to these 
questions, with a number of creative 
and interesting suggestions for outreach 
products. The Agency will use this 
input to develop an outreach plan and 
prepare materials for distribution when 
the rulemaking is completed. In 
addition, and as suggested by a number 
of commenters (see, e.g., Document ID 
#s 0047, 0065, 0081, 0104, 0018, 0025, 
and 0154), OSHA will continue working 
with its partners, alliances and other 
interested parties to examine projects 
that could be completed by them, or in 
coordination with them, that could be 
targeted to specific industries or interest 
groups. 
With regard to the questions on the 
media through which to distribute 
materials, all of the methods mentioned 
in the ANPR received considerable 
support. In addition, a number of 
commenters indicated that all types of 
distribution systems should be used to 
reach the widest audience, including 
the Web site, electronic tools, 
PowerPoint presentations, flash videos, 
a dedicated web page, mail, train-the- 
trainer sessions, regional workshops, 
etc. All of the possible subjects 
suggested by OSHA (e.g., hazard 
classification, labels, and safety data 
sheets) were also endorsed as being of 
interest. 
Many commenters agreed with OSHA 
that training on understanding 
pictograms and symbols, as well as 
hazard statements, signal words, labels, 
and SDSs, would be useful for both 
small businesses and employees (see, 
e.g., Document ID #s 0044, 0061, 0072, 
0028, 0034, 0107, 0139, 0163, and 
0170). There were also several 
recommendations that OSHA prepare a 
poster with the pictograms that can be 
displayed in workplaces (Document ID 
#s 0046, 0047, 0064, 0028, 0123, and 
0171). 
In addition, it was suggested that 
training on classification procedures, 
particularly for mixtures, would be 
useful, as would software that could 
complete mixture calculations (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0046, 0054, 0032, 0038, 
0128, 0140, and 0154). And a number of 
respondents believe that OSHA should 
develop a series of training modules on 
different aspects of the revised HCS 
(Document ID #s 0047, 0051, 0080, 
0025, and 0135), and provide training 
online (Document ID #s 0059, 0032, 
0125, 0129, 0155, and 0157). 
Commenters also suggested that 
OSHA prepare a comprehensive 
comparison of the current standard to 
the revised HCS when completed 
(Document ID #s 0054, 0135, and 0145), 
as well as a reference table with 
different requirements around the world 
(Document ID #s 0047, 0080, 0123, and 
0171). It was also noted that materials 
should be available in multiple 
languages (Document ID #s 0046 and 
0080). 
Other ideas presented included 
electronic seminars (Document ID # 
0064); model programs (Document ID #s 
0064, 0076, 0080, 0029, and 0124); 
toolbox talks (Document ID # 0065); 
Quick Cards (Document ID # 0065); 
online inventory lists (Document ID #s 
0076 and 0178); Q and A document 
(Document ID #s 0072 and 0160); 
hotline (Document ID #s 0077, 0104, 
0179, 0140, and 0163); GHS resource CD 
(Document ID #s 0021 and 0155); SDS 
template (Document ID #s 0144 and 
0145); timely compliance directive 
(Document ID # 0124); and approximate 
conversion table for classifications 
(Document ID #s 0145 and 0163). 
The proposed standard. The 
following is a description of the 
provisions of the proposed standard. 
Comments received that were related to 
the proposed provisions are also 
addressed. 
(a) Purpose. The HCS includes a 
paragraph that states the purpose of the 
rule. This stated purpose is two-fold. 
First, the paragraph indicates that the 
standard addresses assessment of the 
hazards of workplace chemicals, and the 
transmittal of that information to 
employers and employees. It also 
describes the contents of a 
comprehensive hazard communication

program as being container labeling and 
other forms of warning, material safety 
data sheets, and employee training. 
The second part of the paragraph 
addresses the preemption of State or 
local laws by this Federal standard. It 
indicates that OSHA is addressing 
comprehensively the issues described, 
and thus the standard preempts States, 
and political subdivisions of States, 
from addressing these issues except 
under the authority of a Federally- 
approved State plan under Section 18 of 
the OSH Act. While Section 18 applies 
to every occupational safety and health 
standard that OSHA promulgates, the 
HCS raises particular issues because of 
the nature of the provisions. It requires 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
to evaluate the hazards of the chemicals 
they produce or import, and to prepare 
labels and material safety data sheets 
based on those evaluations to transmit 
hazard information and appropriate 
precautionary advice to users 
downstream. This is a unique, but 
highly appropriate approach for an 
OSHA standard, as it recognizes that 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
are in the best position to assess the 
hazards of their products and develop 
appropriate information for labels and 
SDSs. 
There is a national, indeed 
international, marketplace for industrial 
chemicals, and thus chemical 
manufacturers and importers affect 
commerce within the meaning of the 
OSH Act and therefore fall under 
OSHA’s jurisdiction. If a State or a 
political subdivision of a State, were to 
establish different requirements for 
labels and safety data sheets, such 
requirements would have an impact on 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
that are not located in that State. This 
is a burden that the HCS eliminates by 
establishing national requirements. 
The proposed revision to HCS has 
essentially the same purposes, and 
OSHA is proposing only minor 
modifications to this paragraph. 
Paragraph (a)(1)would change the 
language regarding the assessment of 
hazards to indicate that the hazards will 
be ‘‘classified’’ rather than simply 
assessed or evaluated. This is consistent 
with the approach in the GHS. In 
addition, OSHA is proposing to modify 
this paragraph to clearly indicate that 
the standard is intended to be consistent 
with the GHS, Revision 3. That change 
is a reflection of the purpose of this 
rulemaking to harmonize the existing 
requirements with the provisions of the 
GHS, which is the international 
instrument that includes globally 
harmonized provisions on hazard 
communication. In addition, in this 
paragraph and succeeding paragraphs of 
the revised rule, the term ‘‘material 
safety data sheet’’ has been modified to 
‘‘safety data sheet’’ to reflect the 
terminology of the GHS. 
The only modifications proposed to 
paragraph (a)(2) also address 
terminology, using ‘‘classifying’’ instead 
of ‘‘evaluating’’, and ‘‘safety data sheet’’ 
instead of ‘‘material safety data sheet’’. 
There were no specific comments 
received in response to the ANPR 
regarding the Purpose paragraph of the 
HCS. One comment suggested that the 
standard should be limited to a purpose 
of international communication so as 
not to trigger hazard assessments under 
other OSHA standards that address 
respiratory protection, personal 
protective equipment, or process safety 
management (Document ID # 0049). 
There were several other comments that 
indicated that new assessments would 
have to be done for these standards 
(Document ID #s 0178, 0111, 0134, and 
0164). Arguments were made that this 
would lead to extensive additional costs 
for new engineering controls, 
respirators, or other personal protective 
equipment. 
As discussed above, there is no 
identified link to these other standards 
in the stated purpose of the HCS either 
currently or with the proposed 
modifications. While the HCS itself 
requires the provision of information on 
recommended control measures, 
including respiratory protection, 
personal protective equipment, and 
engineering controls, there is no 
requirement for employers to implement 
the recommended controls. All 
information available to an employer 
when designing an appropriate 
protective program must be used, but a 
recommendation on a safety data sheet 
by itself would not trigger the need to 
implement new controls. 
Furthermore, these comments seem to 
imply that there will be major changes 
in the hazards of chemicals based on 
implementation of the GHS provisions. 
Both the HCS and the GHS are based on 
identifying and communicating the 
inherent hazards of chemicals. Thus the 
biggest change for most chemicals under 
the proposal will be in categorizing the 
chemical’s hazards. Under the current 
standard, for example, a chemical either 
is, or is not, a carcinogen. Under the 
revised HCS, if a chemical is a 
carcinogen, it would be categorized as a 
Category 1 or a Category 2 carcinogen. 
Such a change would not generally 
result in a need to change engineering 
controls or respiratory protection. 
It is possible that a chemical may be 
classified under the proposal as having 
a hazard it did not have before, but 
OSHA believes that this is not likely to 
happen frequently given the broad 
coverage of the current rule. 
Furthermore, the physical and chemical 
characteristics of the chemical—which 
affect the types of protection required— 
would not be changed as a result of this 
proposal. OSHA believes that these 
revisions would result in few, if any, 
changes in protective measures required 
under other OSHA standards. 
Several commenters noted what they 
believed to be the continued need to 
address the preemption of State 
standards (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0048, 0056, 0080, 0178, 0036, 0123, and 
0135). In addition, commenters also 
noted that the impact of GHS adoption 
on State and local laws should be 
considered in the process (for example, 
California Proposition 65), and that 
differences between such laws and the 
revised HCS should be discouraged 
(Document ID #s 0042, 0072, 0015, and 
0038). 
It was also indicated that changes in 
State laws should be coordinated with 
the Federal changes to facilitate 
implementation (Document ID # 0146). 
See Section IX and X of this preamble 
for a comprehensive discussion 
regarding Federalism and State plans. 
(b) Scope and Application. The HCS 
is a generic standard that has very broad 
provisions in terms of chemicals 
addressed and workplaces covered. It 
also interfaces with a number of 
requirements of other Federal agencies 
that address labeling of chemical 
hazards. Paragraph (b) thus includes all 
of the practical modifications the 
Agency has developed to ensure that 
employers and employees understand 
how the standard is to be applied, and 
to accommodate various circumstances 
that potentially affect the application of 
the standard. 
The provisions of paragraph (b)(2) in 
the HCS address the overall scope of the 
standard as applying to ‘‘any chemical 
which is known to be present in the 
workplace in such a manner that 
employees may be exposed under 
normal conditions of use or in a 
foreseeable emergency.’’ This provision 
addresses many questions that are 
raised about the application of the 
standard. There was one comment 
received regarding this paragraph which 
indicated that hazard classification and 
labeling of steel for chronic health 
effects should not result from welding 
being considered a normal condition of 
use (Document ID # 0160). OSHA has 
made it clear in past interpretations of 
the rule that where such products are 
intended to be welded, this information 
must be provided for hazard 
communication purposes. That

50387 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
interpretation does not change as a 
result of the proposed provisions in the 
revised rule. 
In general, OSHA does not expect 
significant changes in the chemicals 
covered by the HCS under the proposed 
revisions as compared to the current 
standard. The scope of hazards covered 
by the GHS is very similar to what is 
covered by the current HCS. Additional 
chemicals may be considered to be 
acutely toxic due to the proposed 
adoption of Category 4 in acute toxicity 
which would expand the criteria for 
inclusion from the current definition 
(see the discussion under ‘‘Hazard 
classification’’). However, these 
chemicals are already covered under the 
voluntary national industry consensus 
standard on precautionary labeling of 
industrial chemicals (ANSI Z129) that 
many manufacturers follow in their 
labeling programs, as well as being 
covered in the requirements that apply 
to chemicals shipped to the EU. Thus 
many manufacturers are already 
classifying and labeling these chemicals 
as acute toxins. The proposal is also 
likely to cover fewer mixtures as acute 
toxins than the current rule given the 
hazard classification approach in the 
GHS that uses a calculation based on 
proportionality to determine whether a 
mixture is covered, rather than a strict 
percentage cut-off of 1%. Other 
definitions of health hazards would 
maintain the current broad HCS scope. 
In addition to the overall scope 
statement, the HCS provides for limited 
coverage in workplace situations that 
have special circumstances, including 
laboratories and work operations where 
employees only handle chemicals in 
closed containers. 
OSHA also addresses the interface 
with other Federal agency requirements 
by either exempting the products 
covered from additional OSHA labeling 
(such as pesticides required to be 
labeled by the EPA), or completely 
exempting the product (such as 
hazardous waste regulated by EPA). 
These accommodations help to ensure 
that Federal requirements do not 
conflict or duplicate each other. 
Under the GHS, such provisions are 
left under the purview of the 
‘‘competent authority’’. In developing 
the GHS, it was recognized that 
countries’ regulatory authorities would 
need to have the discretion to address 
such national circumstances in ways 
that are suited to the regulatory 
perspective of the country. Thus 
authorities such as OSHA are free to 
make determinations about scope and 
application issues while still being 
harmonized with the primary provisions 
of the GHS. 
OSHA has reviewed the current 
provisions of paragraph (b), and has 
determined that no significant changes 
are required to be consistent with the 
GHS. Several minor changes to revise 
terminology are proposed (involving the 
terms ‘‘classifying’’ and ‘‘safety data 
sheets’’), but OSHA is not proposing to 
modify any of the remaining provisions 
of paragraph (b). The Agency is also 
deleting Appendix E of the current HCS, 
which was guidance for application of 
the standard, and thus is deleting the 
reference to it in paragraph (b)(1). As is 
discussed elsewhere in this preamble, 
new outreach and compliance 
assistance materials are being prepared 
to replace this appendix and other 
existing outreach materials. 
Several commenters indicated that 
OSHA should adopt exemptions 
included by the European Union in its 
requirements. Specifically, these 
exemptions address non-isolated 
intermediates, chemicals involved in 
research and development, and waste 
(Document ID #s 0049, 0134, and 0164). 
All of these situations are already 
addressed in paragraph (b), and OSHA 
does not believe it is necessary to 
change them. 
In terms of non-isolated 
intermediates, the overall scope 
provision in paragraph (b)(2) adequately 
addresses this situation. This was 
specifically addressed in the preamble 
to the 1983 final rule (48 FR 53335): 
That is, the term ‘‘known’’ means the 
employer need not analyze intermediate 
process streams, for example, to determine 
the presence or quantity of trace 
contaminants. However, where the employer 
knows of such contaminants, and they are 
hazardous, then they fall under the 
provisions of the standard. 
With regard to chemicals involved in 
research and development, paragraph 
(b)(3) limits coverage in laboratories, 
and partially addresses this situation. 
Where there is no knowledge of the 
hazards of such chemicals, the HCS 
does not apply at all since there is no 
requirement to generate new hazard 
information. Where information is 
available, it must be provided to 
exposed employees, consistent with 
paragraph (b)(3) when it is in a 
laboratory situation. Therefore, it 
appears to OSHA that this situation is 
also adequately addressed under the 
current provisions. Hazardous waste as 
regulated by EPA is already exempted 
under paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii). 
There were commenters who 
suggested that OSHA maintain current 
exemptions or limitations in the revised 
GHS, including the consumer product 
exemption (Document ID # 0064), 
guidance on byproducts (Document ID # 
0064), the relative roles of 
manufacturers and employers 
(Document ID # 0064), and the article 
exemption (Document ID # 0160). 
OSHA agrees and all of these 
accommodations remain the same in the 
proposed revised rule. As indicated in 
the ANPR, the Agency does not intend 
to change those parts of the HCS that are 
not affected by the GHS. 
One commenter indicated that the 
revised HCS should indicate that it does 
not apply fully to State prison inmates 
because the GHS information would 
give them data that could be used 
illegally, and perhaps lead to harm 
(Document ID # 0069). Generally 
speaking, State prison inmates are not 
directly subject to Federal requirements 
under OSHA, although such 
requirements may be applied to them 
under State laws or the provisions of 
another Federal agency. This comment 
regarding limitations needed for inmates 
should be addressed in those 
jurisdictions, but nothing in these 
revisions would substantially change 
the application of the HCS to them. 
There were also a few comments 
regarding the scope of the revised rule 
in terms of provisions of the GHS that 
affect the environment or transportation 
(see, e.g., Document ID #s 0072 and 
0179). As OSHA indicated in the ANPR, 
it does not have the authority to require 
information in these areas since they are 
not directed to the protection of 
employees under its jurisdiction. 
However, OSHA does not prohibit this 
type of information on labels or safety 
data sheets, and is aware that it is often 
included on labels and safety data 
sheets currently developed to comply 
with the HCS. OSHA expects that 
chemical manufacturers will, in fact, 
continue to voluntarily include such 
data on their labels and safety data 
sheets to meet the requests of their 
domestic and international customers. 
(c) Definitions. This paragraph in the 
HCS includes the terminology used with 
the corresponding definitions. 
Comprehension of the appropriate 
definitions is critical to understanding 
the provisions of the standard. In some 
cases, terms are defined somewhat 
differently than when used in other 
contexts, so familiarity with the 
standard’s definitions is important. 
In the proposed revisions, OSHA has 
retained as many definitions as possible 
from the current HCS. Changes are 
proposed only when there is a new term 
used that needs to be defined, or there 
is a different definition in the GHS, and 
consistency with the international 
definition is needed for harmonization 
purposes. As with the preceding 
paragraphs, minor modifications have

50388 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
been proposed to ensure terminology is 
appropriate—primarily the use of terms 
related to classification and safety data 
sheets. 
One important difference between the 
HCS and GHS in terminology involves 
the use of the term ‘‘chemical.’’ The 
HCS has used this term since it was 
originally promulgated, and defines it to 
include elements, chemical compounds, 
and mixtures of elements and/or 
compounds. It has been a convenient 
way to describe the coverage of the rule. 
The GHS, like some other international 
standards, uses the terms ‘‘substance’’ 
and ‘‘mixture’’. OSHA has decided to 
maintain a definition of ‘‘chemical’’ in 
the revised standard, which minimizes 
the number of terminology changes that 
have to be made to the regulatory text, 
as well as providing a shorthand way to 
define the scope to include both 
individual substances and mixtures of 
substances. This term is used in the 
body of the proposed regulatory text, 
similar to the use of it in the current 
HCS. However, the proposed 
modifications also include definitions 
for ‘‘substance’’ as well as ‘‘mixture’’ to 
align with the GHS, and both of these 
terms are used as well. In particular, in 
the appendixes that are adopting GHS 
language, the separate terms 
‘‘substance’’ and ‘‘mixture’’ are used 
consistent with the GHS. 
‘‘Substance’’ means chemical 
elements and their compounds in the 
natural state or obtained by any 
production process, including any 
additive necessary to preserve the 
stability of the product and any 
impurities deriving from the process 
used, but excluding any solvent which 
may be separated without affecting the 
stability of the substance or changing its 
composition. 
A ‘‘mixture’’ is defined as a 
‘‘combination or a solution composed of 
two or more substances in which they 
do not react.’’ This is consistent with 
the GHS definition—and while slightly 
different than the definition in the 
current HCS, means the same thing. 
OSHA is also proposing to maintain 
the term ‘‘hazardous chemical’’ as used 
in the current standard (a chemical 
which is a physical or health hazard), 
except to add the term ‘‘classified’’ to 
indicate how it is determined that it is 
a physical or health hazard, and to add 
the coverage of unclassified hazards as 
those terms are defined in a new 
definition explained below. This term 
will be used throughout the standard to 
indicate that the classification process is 
completed, and the chemical 
manufacturer has determined that the 
chemical poses a hazard—either by 
meeting the requirements for a physical 
or health hazard or by virtue of being 
considered an unclassified hazard under 
this section. Most of the substantive 
requirements of the rule apply to 
hazardous chemicals. 
Another proposed modification to the 
definitions paragraph is to move the 
physical hazard definitions to an 
appendix. In the current HCS, health 
hazard definitions are addressed 
specifically in Appendix A to the rule, 
but the physical hazard definitions were 
included in paragraph (c). In the 
proposed revisions, health hazard 
definitions will continue to be 
addressed in Appendix A, but a new 
Appendix B will address physical 
hazards. Both of these appendixes will 
be discussed below under the summary 
and explanation of ‘‘Hazard 
Classification.’’ 
As noted in Section III above, the 
physical hazard definitions in the GHS 
are drawn from the United Nations’ 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods. Since DOT has 
adopted this international approach, the 
GHS definitions are substantially 
harmonized with the U.S. requirements 
for labeling of dangerous goods in 
transport. All chemicals that are 
shipped in the U.S. have already been 
classified according to DOT’s physical 
hazard definitions. This will reduce the 
burdens associated with classifying 
physical hazards under the revised HCS. 
The primary differences involve 
exceptions that make the definitions 
more applicable to workplace situations 
(for example, coverage of flammable 
liquids that are currently defined as 
combustible under the HCS). Modifying 
the HCS to align with the GHS thus 
serves the purpose of harmonizing many 
of these definitions domestically, and 
results in shippers only having to 
classify their chemicals once for most 
physical hazards. 
OSHA is proposing to add a definition 
for the term ‘‘classification’’ in order to 
ensure that the meaning of this term is 
clear. Consistent with the definition of 
classification in the GHS, the proposed 
definition of ‘‘classification’’ is ‘‘to 
identify the relevant data regarding the 
hazards of a chemical; review those data 
to ascertain the hazards associated with 
the chemical, and decide whether the 
chemical will be classified as 
hazardous, and the degree of hazard 
where appropriate, by comparing the 
data with the criteria for health and 
physical hazards.’’ This definition is 
very similar to the process of hazard 
determination that is currently in the 
HCS, with the exception of determining 
the degree of hazard where appropriate. 
This reflects the GHS approach of 
having categories for each class of 
hazard. Under the current HCS, there 
are some definitions that have categories 
in a hazard class (e.g., acute toxicity, 
flammability), but other definitions are 
simply one category (e.g., 
carcinogenicity). The additional 
breakdown in the GHS of classes into 
categories that reflect different severities 
or levels of effect will provide both 
employers and employees with more 
precise information to understand the 
hazards, to consider when evaluating 
workplace conditions to determine the 
risks in the workplace, and to respond 
to exposure incidents. 
In addition to the definition of 
classification, OSHA has proposed a 
definition for ‘‘hazard class’’ and 
‘‘hazard category’’ to further explain the 
approach of breaking down the 
hazardous effects into levels of severity. 
A ‘‘hazard class’’ is defined as ‘‘the 
nature of the physical or health hazards, 
e.g., flammable solid, carcinogen, acute 
oral toxicity.’’ The definition of ‘‘hazard 
category’’ is ‘‘the division of criteria 
within each hazard class, e.g., oral acute 
toxicity and flammable liquids include 
four hazard categories. These categories 
compare hazard severity within a 
hazard class and should not be taken as 
a comparison of hazard categories 
generally.’’ These definitions are also 
taken from the GHS. 
OSHA is proposing to modify the 
term ‘‘health hazard’’ to reflect the 
specific hazards defined in the GHS. 
While the overall scope of what is 
covered is expected to be essentially the 
same as the current HCS, the hazards 
may be identified slightly differently. 
For example, the current HCS covers 
reproductive toxicity as a target organ 
effect, and includes all aspects of the 
effect under that hazard. The GHS has 
a separate definition for germ cell 
mutagenicity, which is considered part 
of reproductive toxicity in the current 
HCS. The definition of ‘‘health hazard’’ 
is thus proposed to be ‘‘a chemical 
which is classified as posing one of the 
following hazardous effects: acute 
toxicity (any route of exposure); skin 
corrosion or irritation; serious eye 
damage or eye irritation; respiratory or 
skin sensitization; germ cell 
mutagenicity; carcinogenicity; 
reproductive toxicity; specific target 
organ toxicity (single or repeated 
exposure); or aspiration toxicity. The 
criteria for determining whether a 
chemical is classified as a health hazard 
are detailed in Appendix A, Health 
Hazard Criteria.’’ 
A revised definition of ‘‘physical 
hazard’’ is also proposed to reflect the 
physical hazards covered in the GHS. 
While these are similar to the coverage 
of the HCS, they are in some cases 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 23:10 Sep 29, 2009 Jkt 217001 PO 00000 Frm 00110 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\30SEP2.SGM 30SEP2sro

50389 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
described somewhat differently. The 
definition proposed for ‘‘physical 
hazard’’ is ‘‘a chemical which is 
classified as posing one of the following 
hazardous effects: explosive; flammable 
(gases, aerosols, liquids, or solids); 
oxidizer (liquid, solid or gas); self- 
reactive; pyrophoric (liquid or solid); 
self-heating; organic peroxide; corrosive 
to metal; gas under pressure; or water- 
activated flammable gas.’’ In addition, 
the definition refers to Appendix B, 
Physical Hazard Criteria, for details. 
The definition of ‘‘label’’ in the GHS 
is slightly different than what is 
currently in the HCS, and OSHA is 
proposing to modify the HCS to be 
consistent. Thus the proposed definition 
of ‘‘label’’ is ‘‘an appropriate group of 
written, printed or graphic information 
elements concerning a hazardous 
chemical that is affixed to, printed on, 
or attached to the immediate container 
of a hazardous chemical, or to the 
outside packaging.’’ The GHS label is 
more specific than what is required in 
HCS, and includes certain core 
information that must be presented. 
Thus a definition for ‘‘label elements’’ is 
also proposed, and it would mean ‘‘the 
specified pictogram, hazard statement, 
signal word, and precautionary 
statement for each hazard class and 
category.’’ ‘‘Safety data sheet (SDS)’’ is 
defined as ‘‘written or printed material 
concerning a hazardous chemical which 
is prepared in accordance with 
paragraph (g) of this section.’’ 
Definitions for terms that describe 
information required to be provided on 
labels are also proposed to be added to 
the HCS. These include ‘‘hazard 
statement’’, ‘‘pictogram,’’ 
‘‘precautionary statement,’’ ‘‘product 
identifier,’’ and ‘‘signal word.’’ These 
proposed new definitions will help to 
clarify the specific requirements for 
labels under the revised HCS, and are 
consistent with similar definitions in 
the GHS. 
‘‘Hazard statement’’ is ‘‘a statement 
assigned to a hazard class and category 
that describes the nature of the hazards 
of a chemical, including, where 
appropriate, the degree of hazard.’’ This 
is essentially what is defined as a 
hazard warning under the current rule. 
An example of a hazard statement under 
the GHS is: Causes serious eye damage. 
These statements have been codified, 
meaning that numbers have been 
assigned to them. They are available in 
all of the official languages of the United 
Nations, and thus translation will not be 
a problem when shipping to countries 
using those languages. Having 
standardized statements is expected to 
facilitate translation into other 
languages as well. 
‘‘Pictogram’’ means a ‘‘composition 
that may include a symbol plus other 
graphic elements, such as a border, 
background pattern, or color, that is 
intended to convey specific information 
about the hazards of a chemical.’’ This 
definition covers both pictograms in the 
transport sector, and those in other 
sectors covered by the GHS. The 
pictograms are required as part of the 
core information provided on a label to 
describe the hazards of a chemical. The 
workplace pictograms will be a black 
symbol on a white background with a 
red diamond border frame. Some 
commenters noted that the frame should 
be permitted to be black for domestic 
shipments as allowed under the GHS 
(see, e.g., Document ID #s 0032 and 
0163). However, as described in Section 
V of this preamble, there are clear 
benefits associated with the use of the 
red frame in terms of recognition and 
comprehensibility. Thus OSHA is 
proposing to only allow the red frame to 
be used, whether the shipment is 
domestic or international. 
Under the GHS, a symbol is generally 
assigned to each hazard class and 
category. There are nine agreed symbols 
under the GHS to convey the health, 
physical and environmental hazards. 
Eight of these symbols are proposed for 
adoption in this rulemaking, the 
exception being the environmental 
symbol. Six of these symbols have been 
used for many years in the international 
transport requirements, so some 
employees will already be familiar with 
them. 
The ‘‘precautionary statement’’ is ‘‘a 
phrase that describes recommended 
measures that should be taken to 
minimize or prevent adverse effects 
resulting from exposure to a hazardous 
chemical or improper storage or 
handling.’’ The precautionary 
statements specified in Appendix C will 
be required on containers under the 
revised HCS. An example of a 
precautionary statement is ‘‘wear 
protective gloves.’’ The precautionary 
statements in the GHS are assigned to 
certain hazard classes and categories. 
Precautionary statements have not 
previously been required under the 
HCS, although many chemical 
manufacturers include them on their 
labels for safe handling and use. These 
statements are codified under the GHS, 
meaning that numbers have been 
assigned to them. The precautionary 
statements in the GHS are not 
harmonized like the hazard statements 
are, and the regulatory authority is free 
to use the statements in the GHS annex 
or to use alternative statements when 
adopting the current version of the GHS. 
Using the GHS statements has the 
advantage of adopting statements that 
have undergone expert review by the 
Subcommittee, are assigned to the 
appropriate hazard class and category, 
and have been translated into six 
languages. Work continues on them in 
the Subcommittee to combine or edit 
the precautionary statements to reduce 
repetition and complexity of the label. 
The precautionary statements may be 
considered harmonized in the future. 
Other countries are already using them 
(e.g., in Europe). Since OSHA did not 
previously require the use of 
precautionary statements, and had no 
such recommended statements to 
provide, the Agency has decided to use 
those currently in the GHS as the 
mandatory requirements. This will 
make it easier for compliance since 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
will not need to develop, maintain, and 
translate precautionary statements on 
their own. It will also help employees 
since they will be seeing the same 
language on labels regardless of the 
supplier of the chemical. Such 
standardization improves 
comprehension, and thus the 
effectiveness of the information 
transmitted under the standard. 
Container labels will also be required 
to include a ‘‘product identifier.’’ The 
proposed definition for this term is ‘‘the 
name or number used for a hazardous 
chemical on a label and in the SDS. It 
provides a unique means by which the 
user can identify the chemical. The 
product identifier used shall permit 
cross references to be made among the 
required list of hazardous chemicals, the 
label, and the SDS.’’ In other words, the 
product identifier is essentially the 
same as the ‘‘identity’’ under the current 
HCS. The GHS allows competent 
authorities for workplace requirements 
to choose not to require specific 
chemical identities of ingredients to be 
listed on the label, as long as they are 
on the SDS. This is the approach OSHA 
currently uses in the HCS, and it has 
been effective. OSHA will continue to 
require chemical identities only on 
SDSs, and has proposed a definition for 
‘‘product identifier’’ that is consistent 
with the current definition for 
‘‘identity’’ to maintain this approach. 
Another new concept being proposed 
for HCS labels is inclusion of a ‘‘signal 
word’’ to bring attention to the 
hazardous effects, as well as to 
contribute to the recognition of the 
severity of the hazard. Signal words 
have been used for many years in the 
United States on consumer and 
pesticide labels. The proposed 
definition is ‘‘a word used to indicate 
the relative level of severity of hazard 
and alert the reader to a potential hazard

on the label. The signal words used in 
this section are ‘danger’ and ‘warning.’ 
‘Danger’ is used for the more severe 
hazards, while ‘warning’ is used for the 
less severe.’’ 
OSHA is proposing to add a definition 
to the HCS for ‘‘unclassified’’ hazards. 
As has been noted, the current HCS is 
performance-oriented, and takes a very 
broad approach to defining hazards 
covered by the rule. The GHS is 
similarly broad in approach, but 
includes very specific definitions of 
criteria to apply when determining 
whether a chemical poses a physical or 
health hazard. This specification 
approach has significant benefits 
associated with it, including providing 
more guidance to help ensure a 
consistent approach to determining 
hazards. It also allows more information 
to be developed that provides an 
indication of the severity of effect. 
In the ANPR, OSHA asked for 
comment on whether these criteria are 
sufficient to cover the hazards present 
in the workplace. While the Agency 
believes the scope of coverage is similar 
between the two approaches, OSHA 
wants to be sure that the new approach 
is as comprehensive as the existing 
standard. The primary hazard addressed 
by respondents to this question was 
combustible dust. As will be discussed 
later in this preamble, OSHA has 
proposed that the United Nations add 
criteria for combustible dust to the GHS, 
so this issue should be resolved in the 
future by having the necessary criteria. 
Another potential example is simple 
asphyxiation. The only specific 
reference to this effect in the GHS is in 
the part of the SDS that covers hazards 
that do not result in classification— 
suffocation is listed as an example. The 
definition of ‘‘unclassified hazard’’ 
could be used in this situation as well. 
Alternatively OSHA is considering 
proposing a definition and label 
elements as discussed in the issues 
section. 
It is possible that there are other 
hazards that may not yet be specifically 
defined. The addition of the definition 
for unclassified hazards is intended to 
address these situations. Where a 
classifier has identified evidence of a 
hazard, but the evidence does not meet 
the currently specified criteria for 
hazards covered by the rule, the 
definition for unclassified hazards will 
capture those hazards to ensure that the 
modified HCS is appropriately 
protective, and covers all of the hazards 
covered by the current rule. During the 
negotiations for the GHS, U.S. industry 
representatives often raised the issue of 
ensuring that they could provide 
additional hazard information in order 
to satisfy product liability laws in the 
U.S. This was the rationale for allowing 
such information to be included on 
labels under supplementary 
information, and on SDSs under Section 
2. Addition of the definition of 
‘‘unclassified hazards’’, and specific 
recognition of the need to provide 
information when such effects arise, 
should help U.S. industry address its 
product liability concerns as well as 
protect exposed workers. 
OSHA would require the chemicals 
posing unclassified hazards to be treated 
as hazardous chemicals under the rule. 
The Agency anticipates that this 
information would appear in Section 2 
of the SDS (Hazard Identification)—the 
GHS already identifies this as the 
appropriate place in its guidance on the 
contents of SDSs (A4.3.2.3, Other 
hazards which do not result in 
classification), and it is included in 
Appendix D of this proposal as 
unclassified hazard. In terms of labeling, 
there would be no specified label 
elements for chemicals that pose 
unclassified hazards. The label for such 
hazards must describe the hazardous 
effects under supplementary 
information on the label, as well as 
provide any appropriate precautionary 
information. OSHA also expects that 
such hazards would be addressed in 
worker training programs. 
The Agency anticipates that there will 
be relatively few situations where there 
will be scientific evidence or data 
indicating a hazard that is not currently 
classified, but wants to ensure that this 
information is captured and conveyed to 
employers and employees. It appears 
that it would also be appropriate to 
establish a feedback mechanism so in 
the future, classifiers can inform OSHA 
of these situations where the current 
criteria are insufficient, and the Agency 
can then suggest to the United Nations 
that appropriate criteria be developed 
and added to the GHS. This is 
consistent with the overall approach to 
hazard classification in the GHS that 
OSHA is proposing to adopt—that 
specific criteria be provided to help 
ensure that classification is appropriate, 
and information transmittal is 
consistent from company-to-company. 
Therefore, the use of the definition of 
unclassified hazard should be a 
temporary situation for these hazards, 
ensuring information is provided until 
such time as the criteria are added to the 
rule. OSHA is requesting additional 
input on this approach in the issues 
section. 
OSHA is not proposing to revise the 
other terms currently defined in the 
HCS. In addition, the GHS includes a 
number of definitions that did not 
appear to be necessary for inclusion in 
the revised HCS and as a result have not 
been addressed here. 
(d) Hazard classification. 
Hazard determination under the 
current standard. Under the existing 
HCS, chemical manufacturers and 
importers are required to evaluate the 
scientific data available regarding the 
chemicals they produce or import, and 
determine whether they are hazardous 
within the meaning of the standard. 
This requires a thorough search of the 
scientific literature on both the health 
and physical hazards that the chemical 
may pose. The identified information 
must be evaluated within the 
parameters established in the standard 
to determine whether the chemical is 
considered to pose a hazard. Paragraph 
(d), Hazard determination, provides the 
regulatory approach for evaluation. This 
is to be implemented using the 
definitions provided in paragraph (c), as 
well as in Appendix A, which provides 
further elaboration on the nature and 
breadth of health hazards covered. 
Appendix B provides additional 
requirements for identifying and 
evaluating data regarding hazards. Both 
of these appendixes are mandatory. 
In order to ensure the broadest 
dissemination of information, and to 
reduce the number of situations where 
conflicting determinations may be made 
for the same chemical by different 
suppliers, the HCS considers one study, 
conducted according to established 
scientific principles and producing a 
statistically significant result consistent 
with the definitions of hazard in the 
standard, to be sufficient for a finding of 
health hazard under the rule. See 29 
CFR 1910.1200(d)(2) and Appendix B. 
This approach was the broadest among 
those systems that were used as the 
basis for the development of the GHS. 
Most of the definitions under the HCS 
simply lead to a conclusion that the 
chemical involved poses that hazard or 
it does not. For example, a chemical 
might be found to be a carcinogen under 
the rule based on one study indicating 
that it poses a carcinogenic effect. The 
current standard does not generally 
address the degree of severity of the 
hazardous effect in most of the 
definitions—so a chemical is either a 
carcinogen, or it is not. However, while 
a one study determination leads to 
providing information about that 
hazardous effect on a safety data sheet, 
it may not lead to a hazard warning on 
a label. The HCS requires such warnings 
to be ‘‘appropriate’’, and there are 
situations where the data do not support 
warning about the hazard on the label 
because of other negative studies or 
information. See 29 CFR 1910 (f)(1)(ii).

Thus there is consideration of the 
weight of evidence when deciding what 
to include on a label. Chemical 
manufacturers and importers may also 
review the weight of evidence in 
preparing SDSs, and are permitted to 
discuss negative evidence and other 
constraints when reporting the 
information. Under the current 
standard, OSHA expects the hazard 
evaluation process to go beyond simply 
identifying one study, and includes a 
complete evaluation of all of the 
information available when determining 
what information to transmit to users of 
the chemical. 
This hazard evaluation process is 
consistent with product stewardship 
processes that have evolved in the 
chemical industry. (See, e.g., the 
Responsible Care® program 
implemented by chemical 
manufacturers.) Under such processes, 
chemical manufacturers develop and 
maintain thorough knowledge of their 
chemicals. This knowledge is critical to 
the safe handling and use of the 
chemicals in their own facilities, as well 
as in their customers’ facilities. It is also 
critical to handling product liability 
concerns for their materials. 
The HCS requires chemical 
manufacturers to remain vigilant 
regarding new information about their 
chemicals, and to add significant new 
information about hazards or protective 
measures to their hazard 
communication documents within three 
months of learning about them. See 29 
CFR 1910.1200(f)(11), (g)(5). This has 
always been seen by OSHA as a more 
rigorous, but essential, requirement than 
some other countries’ provisions, which 
only require these documents to be 
reviewed every few years. It should be 
noted that OSHA has not been enforcing 
the current requirement to change labels 
within three months of getting new 
information. This stay on enforcement 
began some years ago when the standard 
was first promulgated, and involved 
concerns about existing stockpiles of 
chemicals and other related 
information. OSHA is proposing to 
reinstate the requirement and lift the 
stay, making the updating period 
consistent with that required for safety 
data sheets, and invites comments on 
this issue. 
At the time the HCS was promulgated, 
the standard’s provisions and approach 
were quite novel, and there were 
concerns that chemical manufacturers 
and importers would need more 
guidance regarding what chemicals to 
consider hazardous. Thus OSHA 
included provisions in the hazard 
determination paragraph that 
established certain chemicals as being 
hazardous. Chemical manufacturers and 
importers still had to complete a hazard 
evaluation and determination of what 
hazards were posed, but for these 
designated chemicals, there was no 
decision to be made as to whether they 
were hazardous or not. These chemicals 
were considered to be a ‘‘floor’’ of 
chemicals covered by the rule, and 
included those for which OSHA has 
permissible exposure limits in 29 CFR 
part 1910, as well as those for which the 
American Conference of Governmental 
Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has 
recommended Threshold Limit Values 
(TLVs). In addition, given that 
carcinogenicity was the most 
controversial and difficult health effect 
to address, OSHA indicated that at a 
minimum, chemicals found to be 
carcinogenic in the National Toxicology 
Program’s Annual Report on 
Carcinogens, or in monographs 
published by the International Agency 
for Research on Cancer, were to be 
considered to be carcinogens in addition 
to those regulated by OSHA as 
carcinogens. 
The existing HCS also includes 
provisions regarding hazard 
determinations for mixtures. 29 CFR 
1910.1200(d)(5). Where such mixtures 
have been tested to determine their 
hazardous effects, the data on the 
mixture as a whole is used. Where 
testing has not been done, OSHA 
promulgated an approach based on the 
percentage of a hazardous chemical in a 
mixture to determine if the mixture is 
hazardous. Therefore, if a mixture 
contains one percent or more of a 
chemical determined to present a health 
hazard, the mixture is assumed to have 
the same effect. The one exception is 
carcinogens—a mixture is considered to 
be carcinogenic if it contains 0.1% or 
more of a chemical found to be 
carcinogenic. 
In all cases, a mixture will still be 
considered to be hazardous if there is 
evidence that it poses a health risk 
when the hazardous chemical is present 
in concentrations below the cut-offs. 
This was included to ensure that 
chemicals that can have effects at very 
low concentrations, such as sensitizers, 
will be adequately addressed. 
For physical hazards, the evaluator 
must determine based on whatever 
objective evidence is available whether 
the hazardous effect is still possible in 
smaller concentrations. This recognizes 
that for physical effects, such a 
determination may be made based on 
factors such as dilution, and there are 
readily available means to make an 
appropriate assessment. 
The approach in the existing HCS is 
considered to be a self-classification 
system. In other words, the chemical 
manufacturer or importer reviews the 
available information, and makes the 
determination as to whether the product 
presents a potential hazardous effect. 
This is different than some other 
systems where the regulatory authority 
makes the determination, and publishes 
a list of hazardous chemicals that must 
be used by the chemical manufacturer 
or importer. 
The hazard determination is to be 
completed based on available 
information. The HCS does not require 
testing of chemicals to produce 
information where it is not available. 
The hazard determination approach 
in the HCS recognizes that information 
about chemicals changes, new 
chemicals are introduced, others cease 
to be used—in other words, the world 
of chemicals in the workplace changes 
constantly, and the standard is designed 
to ensure that employees receive the 
most up-to-date information available 
regarding the chemicals to which they 
are currently being exposed. 
Employers who simply use chemicals, 
rather than producing or importing 
them, are permitted to rely on the 
information received from their 
suppliers. 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(1). This 
downstream flow of information 
recognizes that the chemical 
manufacturers and importers have 
access to information about the 
chemicals they sell that is not available 
to those who only use them. It also 
reduces duplication of effort by focusing 
the hazard determination process at the 
source, rather than having everyone 
who uses a chemical trying to complete 
such a process. 
The HCS requires chemical 
manufacturers and importers to 
maintain a copy of the procedures they 
follow to make hazard determinations. 
29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(6). If OSHA finds 
errors in a label or SDS, the chemical 
manufacturer or importer that prepared 
the document will be held responsible— 
not the employer using the chemical. 
The hazard determination procedures 
in the HCS, including the definitions 
and Appendixes A and B, have been in 
place since the standard was 
promulgated in 1983. Therefore, the 
intent to design an approach that was 
dynamic and would remain current 
through changes in the workplace 
appears to have been accomplished. 
Hazard Classification under the GHS. 
The challenge in negotiating an 
international approach was to create a 
system that did not require frequent 
changes yet remained current and 
protective, incorporating the best parts 
of the approaches in the existing 
systems. The GHS embodies an

approach that is very similar to the 
existing HCS in scope and concept, but 
builds in additional details and 
parameters to help to ensure 
consistency worldwide. Like the HCS, 
the GHS approach is based on a 
downstream flow of information from 
suppliers to users; self-classification; 
use of available information with no 
new testing; and a broad approach to 
definitions of hazard. The GHS has 
further refined the approach to include 
addressing the degree of severity of the 
hazardous effects by assigning 
categories of hazard within hazard 
classes; providing detailed scientific 
approaches to evaluating the available 
data to help ensure that multiple 
evaluators produce similar results when 
classifying hazards; and allowing a 
broader use of available data by 
establishing principles where data can 
be extrapolated in situations regarding 
mixtures. OSHA believes that these 
additional provisions in the GHS 
enhance employee protection in 
addition to the benefits of having an 
internationally harmonized approach 
when preparing labels and SDSs. 
To accommodate these refinements, 
and improve protection for employees 
exposed to chemicals in the U.S., OSHA 
is proposing to modify the HCS as 
follows. First, paragraph (d) would be 
re-named ‘‘hazard classification’’ rather 
than the current ‘‘hazard 
determination.’’ This is to be consistent 
with the approach and terminology used 
in the GHS. Similarly, paragraph (d)(1) 
would be modified to indicate that 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
would be required to: 
* * * [c]lassify their health and physical 
hazards in accordance with this section. For 
each chemical, the chemical manufacturer or 
importer shall determine which hazard 
classes, and the category of each class, that 
apply to the chemical being classified. 
Paragraph (d)(1) would continue to 
allow employers to rely on information 
received from suppliers. 
Paragraph (d)(2) would be similarly 
modified to use terminology regarding 
classification. However, the paragraph 
also includes modifications to address 
the evaluation process, and the role of 
testing. The paragraph specifically states 
that evaluation of the hazards of 
chemicals requires the evaluator to 
‘‘identify and consider the full range of 
available scientific literature and other 
evidence concerning the potential 
hazards.’’ This is consistent with the 
current HCS, but re-emphasizes the 
responsibility to fully characterize the 
hazard of the chemicals. To clarify that 
available evidence is to be used, new 
paragraph (d)(2) specifically states that 
there is no requirement to test a 
chemical to classify its hazards under 
the modified provisions—just as there is 
no such requirement under the current 
HCS. 
Proposed paragraph (d)(2) also refers 
to Appendixes A and B for further 
information on classification as in the 
current standard. However, the 
proposed Appendixes have been 
completely changed from the current 
text. New Appendix A would include 
the criteria for classification of health 
hazards, and new Appendix B would 
include the criteria for classification of 
physical hazards. These mandatory 
appendixes would have to be used for 
the hazard classification process under 
the proposed revised standard. 
Reference to these appendixes is also 
included in new paragraph (d)(3), which 
addresses mixtures. This proposed 
paragraph re-emphasizes that chemical 
manufacturers and importers must 
follow the procedures in Appendixes A 
and B to classify hazards for mixtures as 
well as for individual chemicals. In 
addition, this proposed paragraph 
indicates that chemical manufacturers 
or importers would maintain the overall 
responsibility for the accuracy of their 
hazard classifications for mixtures even 
if they rely on ingredient information 
received from a supplier. 
During implementation of the current 
HCS, OSHA allowed formulators of 
chemicals to develop an SDS by simply 
providing the SDSs for all the 
ingredients rather than compiling a 
specific SDS for the product. OSHA 
does not believe that this practice is 
widely pursued, but it would not be 
permitted under the proposal. The 
revisions to the approach to classifying 
mixtures would not lend itself to such 
a practice. Hazard classification requires 
consideration and application of 
bridging principles based on the 
constituents, as well as the application 
of a formula when there are multiple 
ingredients with acute toxicity. These 
approaches require the evaluator to 
determine a classification for the 
mixture as a whole. In addition, this 
practice places more of a burden on the 
user of the product to sort out the 
relevant information for protection of 
their employees. The formulator is in a 
better position to assess the information 
and provide what is needed to their 
customers. 
Under the current HCS, paragraph 
(d)(6) requires chemical manufacturers, 
importers, or employers performing 
hazard determinations to keep a copy of 
the procedures they follow in the hazard 
determination process. This provision 
has been deleted in the proposed 
revisions because the hazard 
classification procedures have been 
specified, and thus all evaluators are 
following the same process. 
Proposed paragraph (d) is thus much 
shorter and less detailed than paragraph 
(d) in the existing standard. This is 
largely due to the approach in the GHS 
to include the details regarding 
classification in hazard-specific 
discussions that address both the 
individual chemical and that chemical 
in mixtures. Given the volume of these 
criteria, it appeared to OSHA that 
presenting the relevant information in 
mandatory appendixes was a more 
efficient way to describe the criteria 
than including it all in the primary text 
of the standard. This is particularly true 
for those many employers reading the 
standard who do not have to perform 
hazard classification—the proposed 
revisions only apply to chemical 
manufacturers and importers, unless an 
employer chooses not to rely on 
information received from them. 
Appendix A, Health Hazards. 
Proposed Appendix A begins with an 
introduction that includes material 
related to principles of classification 
taken from Chapter 1 of the GHS. These 
address both weight of the evidence, 
and the approach to mixtures. The 
remainder of Appendix A is taken from 
Chapter 3 of the GHS on Health 
Hazards. OSHA has included the 
specific discussions of all of the health 
hazards covered by the HCS in proposed 
Appendix A, extracted from Chapter 3 
of the GHS. Generally speaking, OSHA 
has proposed the language from Chapter 
3 regarding the criteria for classification 
to minimize deviations from the GHS 
approach. However, each of the hazard 
discussions has been reviewed carefully 
within the context of the HCS, and there 
has been some editing by OSHA. This 
has been primarily to shorten the 
discussions where possible to delete any 
portions that do not relate specifically to 
the method of classification for either 
individual substances or mixtures. Thus 
OSHA has removed the decision logics 
that are in the GHS from the proposed 
criteria, and is considering including 
them in a guidance document to be 
made available at the time a final rule 
is published. The hazard 
communication portions of the criteria 
chapters have also been removed since 
all of this information is already 
available in proposed Appendix C and 
is thus duplicative. In addition, as 
discussed further below, edits have been 
made where OSHA has not proposed to 
adopt all of the categories of a particular 
hazard class. 
The chapters on Skin Corrosion/ 
Irritation and Serious Eye Damage/ 
Irritation have been modified more

extensively than the other chapters on 
health hazards in the GHS. In these 
chapters, the GHS leads the evaluator to 
conduct additional testing on the 
chemical when information is not 
available. While the GHS does not 
require such testing, the criteria for 
these effects imply that it should be 
conducted to complete an evaluation. 
The HCS is based solely on available 
information, and no testing is ever 
required. Therefore, OSHA has modified 
these chapters to eliminate any 
references to additional testing, and 
limit the evaluation to what is known 
based on available information. It 
should be noted that the UNSCEGHS 
has initiated work to review these 
chapters to edit them and make them 
easier to follow. OSHA will be 
participating in this activity. 
Each proposed hazard class 
discussion includes the criteria for 
classifying a substance or a mixture. 
Unlike the HCS, which defines across- 
the-board percentage cut-offs for all 
hazard classes, the GHS employs a 
tiered approach to classification. Like 
the HCS, classification would be based 
on test data for a mixture as a whole for 
most hazard classes where it is 
available. However, where it is not 
available, but there are data on 
ingredients and similar mixtures, the 
GHS allows extrapolation or bridging of 
data to classify a mixture. This allows 
greater use of available data before 
resorting to a percentage cut-off or 
similar approach. Where such data are 
not available, the criteria address how to 
classify mixtures based on cut-offs 
specific to that hazard. In the case of 
acute toxicity, this includes calculations 
based on the acute toxicity of each 
ingredient in the mixture. 
The tiered scheme is somewhat 
different for certain hazard classes. As 
described, usually the evaluation is 
based first on test data available on the 
complete mixture, followed by the 
applicable bridging principles, and 
lastly, cut-off values/concentration or 
additivity. The criteria for Germ Cell 
Mutagenicity, Carcinogenicity, and 
Reproductive Toxicity take a different 
approach by considering the cut-off 
levels as the primary tier and allowing 
the classification to be modified on a 
case-by-case basis based on available 
test data for the mixture as a whole. 
This is related to the sensitivity of 
available test methods to detect these 
types of effects at small concentrations 
in the mixture as a whole. 
This may result in some mixtures that 
are currently considered to pose a 
particular hazard not being so classified 
under the GHS. OSHA believes that the 
protections of the GHS approach are 
appropriate, and that these changes will 
not result in an inappropriate reduction 
in protection. For example, if there is a 
mixture that is 1% of an acutely toxic 
material, regardless of the severity of 
that effect, and it is diluted with 99% 
water, the current HCS would require 
that mixture to be considered acutely 
toxic. Under the GHS, it is unlikely to 
be considered as such—based on the 
dilution effect of the water, the acute 
toxicity is no longer a concern. Thus the 
bridging principles under the GHS 
allow for a more accurate assessment of 
the potential harm of the mixture, 
whereas the strict cut-off approach 
under the current HCS may provide 
hazard information in cases where the 
exposure is minimal and the occurrence 
of an adverse effect is unlikely. In the 
example described, the presence of the 
water in the mixture as used by the 
workers reduces the potential for 
exposure to the hazardous ingredient to 
such a small amount that no effect is 
expected to result. The GHS approach is 
not as simple to apply as the current 
HCS, but the resulting approximation of 
the hazards of the mixture will be more 
accurate. 
There are several hazard classes in the 
GHS that give competent authorities 
such as OSHA a choice of concentration 
limits to apply when classifying a 
mixture containing ingredients that pose 
these effects (e.g., reproductive toxicity, 
sensitization, target organ effects). 
OSHA is proposing to use the most 
protective of the available concentration 
limits for these hazard classes, and 
require information to be provided on 
labels and safety data sheets at 
concentrations above 0.1%. Other 
countries may choose to only provide 
the information on SDSs when the 
concentration is higher. These particular 
health effects are among the most 
significant to employees, and OSHA 
believes the provision of information on 
labels will help both employers and 
employees ensure that appropriate 
protective measures are followed. 
In determining which categories to 
propose to adopt, OSHA employed two 
primary principles in reviewing them. 
First, the Agency tried to maintain a 
scope as consistent as possible with the 
current scope of the HCS, in particular 
to maintain the level of protection in 
keeping with that principle established 
to guide the harmonization process (see 
Section III)(an approach specifically 
supported by Document ID #s 0021, 
0163, and 0170). Second, consistent 
with comments received and discussed 
previously in this preamble (e.g., 
Document ID #s 0104, 0128, 0155, and 
0171), OSHA reviewed what major 
trading partners of the U.S. have 
indicated they are proposing to adopt— 
in particular, the EU since they have 
already adopted an approach. Where 
possible, and appropriate in terms of 
maintaining protections and an 
appropriate scope for the workplace, 
OSHA has sought to be consistent with 
these other proposed approaches for the 
workplace. 
All of the health hazard classes in the 
GHS have been proposed to be adopted 
in the HCS. However, for acute toxicity, 
OSHA is proposing to adopt Categories 
1 through 4, but not 5. (See Appendix 
A.1 for a detailed explanation of acute 
toxicity categories and their 
corresponding cut-offs.) The current 
coverage of the HCS is greater than 
Category 3 of the GHS, but does not 
include all of Category 4. If OSHA were 
to adopt only 3 categories, it would 
reduce protections with regard to acute 
toxicity. Adopting Category 4 expands 
coverage somewhat. However, 
chemicals meeting the definition of 
Category 4 are already covered under 
the national consensus standard on 
labeling that many chemical 
manufacturers already follow (ANSI 
Z129). In addition, those chemicals are 
already covered by the EU under their 
existing classification, packaging, and 
labeling of dangerous substances 
(Directive 67/548/EEC) and preparations 
(Directive 1999/45/EC) directives, and 
their adopted GHS provisions. These 
countries comprise the largest trading 
partner in chemicals for the U.S. Thus, 
many manufacturers are already 
classifying their chemicals as acutely 
toxic to comply with European 
requirements. 
Coverage of Category 5 would not 
only expand coverage significantly, it 
would lead to inconsistency with 
Europe and with the current national 
consensus standard. OSHA also believes 
that exposures of this magnitude are not 
likely to be encountered in the 
occupational setting, and that such 
coverage would be excessive. 
Since OSHA raised this issue for 
comment, a number of respondents 
specifically addressed acute toxicity. 
The responses varied, although a 
number supported the approach 
proposed to cover through Category 4 
(Document ID #s 0046, 0047, 0077, 
0104, 0021, 0123, 0135, 0145, 0155, 
0163, and 0171). For example, Dow 
(Document ID # 0047) stated: 
Dow believes that OSHA should adopt all 
health hazard criteria and categories, except 
Acute Toxicity Category 5. While this 
category may be useful for characterizing 
consumer products, its use with the 
substances characterized under the HCS 
would be confusing and unnecessary. Dow 
understands that the EU and Australia have

both chosen not to include Acute Toxicity 
Category 5 in their implementation of the 
GHS and that Canada is currently 
considering doing the same. Dow believes 
that the U.S. should be consistent with these 
other major trading partners by not including 
this category when it adopts the GHS. 
Others suggested that OSHA propose 
to adopt Categories 1 through 3 
(Document ID #s 0054, 0034, 0128, and 
0141). Some argued that all categories 
should be adopted to ensure 
harmonization (see, e.g., Document ID 
#s 0050, 0078, 0106, 0018, 0036, and 
0116). 
As indicated, OSHA believes that 
coverage of Categories 1 through 4 is 
appropriately protective for the 
workplace, and leads to the greatest 
harmonization with workplace 
authorities in other countries. With 
regard to coverage of Category 5, OSHA 
would not preclude inclusion of 
information on Category 5 on the label 
or the SDS when implementing the 
proposed revisions. Thus chemical 
manufacturers or importers who wish to 
have one label that suffices for the 
workplace and the consumer sector, for 
example, could do that and still be in 
compliance with the HCS. 
While OSHA has chosen not to adopt 
Category 5 for the reasons described, 
and it does not appear in the Table 
A.1.1, Paragraph A.1.3.6.1(a) requires 
that the calculation of acute toxicity for 
mixtures ‘‘[i]nclude ingredients with a 
known acute toxicity, which fall into 
any of the GHS acute toxicity 
categories.’’ The intent of this provision 
in the GHS was to include data on 
substances classified as Category 5 in 
the mixture calculation. The exclusion 
of Category 5 from the text of the acute 
toxicity table will likely mean that 
classifiers could overlook substances 
falling into this category in the mixtures 
calculation, resulting in a higher (less 
protective) classification. This could 
also mean a lack of harmonization 
within the U.S. if other Federal agencies 
adopt Category 5, potentially requiring 
inclusion of these data in the 
calculation. The European Union GHS 
system excluded Category 5 for all 
sectors, and has explicitly excluded 
Category 5 data from the mixture 
calculation. OSHA invites comment on 
whether Category 5 data should be 
included in the calculation of the acute 
toxicity of mixtures, and whether 
exclusion of these data presents a 
significant difference in hazard 
classification. 
OSHA is also not proposing to adopt 
Category 3 for skin corrosion/irritation. 
This particular category appears to 
cover much more than the current 
criteria for this hazardous effect under 
the HCS. In addition, the irritant effects 
covered by Category 3 are very minor 
and transient, and of limited 
applicability in the workplace setting. 
The Agency received several comments 
supporting such an approach 
(Document ID #s 0077, 0034, 0128, 
0145, and 0171). This approach is also 
consistent with the European Union. 
OSHA has also not proposed to adopt 
Category 2 for aspiration hazards 
covered by the GHS. This category 
appears to be more appropriate for the 
consumer sector than the workplace. 
OSHA does not specifically address 
aspiration hazards in the current HCS 
although the Agency believes the more 
relevant and serious Category 1 
aspiration hazards are captured under 
the broad scope of the rule. Several 
commenters suggested that Category 2 
not be covered when aligning the HCS 
with the GHS (Document ID #s 0077, 
0034, 0128, 0145, and 0171), and the EU 
does not include it in their 
requirements. Others suggested that 
aspiration should not be covered at all 
since it is not relevant to the 
occupational setting (Document ID #s 
0102, 0104, and 0163). However, OSHA 
believes that accidental aspiration is 
possible in the occupational setting, and 
thus has proposed to adopt the criteria 
for Category 1. 
Appendix B, Physical Hazards. 
Appendix B includes the criteria for the 
physical hazards proposed to be covered 
by the HCS to be consistent with the 
GHS. The current HCS covers these 
hazards, but the definitions, while 
similar, are not the same as those 
included in the GHS. The GHS based its 
physical hazard criteria on those 
incorporated into the United Nations’ 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods. In the U.S., the 
Department of Transportation (DOT) has 
already harmonized its definitions with 
the UN, and thus, with few exceptions, 
the GHS. While OSHA’s initial physical 
hazard definitions were consistent with 
the DOT definitions at the time the HCS 
was promulgated, DOT’s harmonization 
with the international requirements 
resulted in the two agencies having 
different definitions. Thus the U.S. has 
not been domestically harmonized for 
some years—adopting the same 
definitions as DOT has in this 
rulemaking will thus have the 
additional benefit of accomplishing 
substantial domestic harmonization. 
As with Appendix A and the health 
hazard criteria, OSHA has edited 
Chapter 2 of the GHS to shorten the 
discussions and focus only on the 
criteria in the proposed revisions. 
Decision logics and hazard 
communication information are not 
included. OSHA is considering a 
guidance document with the decision 
logics to be made available when a final 
rule is completed, and the hazard 
communication information is already 
in proposed Appendix C, so to include 
it in Appendix A would be duplicative. 
As with health hazards, OSHA is 
trying to maintain the current scope of 
the HCS for physical hazards in the 
proposal, as well as being as consistent 
as possible with trading partners, 
particularly the European Union. One 
exception may be flammable gases, 
where it appears that more flammable 
gases will be covered by OSHA adopting 
Category 2 than are currently covered by 
the HCS. OSHA is proposing to adopt 
all of the physical hazards in the GHS. 
The one deviation from the approach 
adopted by the European Union is in the 
proposed adoption of Categories 1 
through 4 for flammable liquids. The 
European system only addresses 
Categories 1 through 3. Given the 
current coverage of the HCS, not 
covering Category 4 would be a 
reduction of protection that OSHA does 
not believe is appropriate. Thus we are 
proposing to include coverage of 
Category 4 in the HCS. 
One edit that should be noted occurs 
in the criteria for explosives. The GHS 
criteria currently use the term ‘‘article’’ 
in a manner that is inconsistent with 
that term as used in the workplace in 
the U.S. OSHA has changed the term to 
‘‘item’’ in these criteria. 
While OSHA believes that 
harmonizing with DOT provides 
significant benefits, there are some 
concerns regarding this approach that 
have arisen in reviewing the physical 
hazard criteria. These concerns involve 
the test methods referred to in the GHS 
criteria, which are based on issues 
related to the packaging and volume in 
transportation. Packaging is obviously a 
major concern in transport, and is used 
to address or mitigate the risk of 
conveying certain types of chemicals. 
These chemicals may or may not be 
present in the workplace in the same 
size or type of packaging and the 
relevance of these factors in the test 
methods are questionable in terms of 
workplace exposures. OSHA invites 
comment on this issue, both in terms of 
the appropriateness of the criteria as 
drawn (including the test methods and 
references to packaging or volume), and 
any suggestions that interested parties 
have to address these issues. The 
criteria of particular interest involve 
those for self-reactive chemicals, organic 
peroxides, self-heating chemicals, and 
explosives.

some of the physical hazard criteria in 
other OSHA standards that rely on HCS 
definitions (for example, process safety 
management). Many comments were 
received on this issue (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0042, 0076, 0077, 0015, 
0024, 0108, 0128, 0145, and 0163). 
While opinions varied, generally the 
consensus was that OSHA needed to 
make the standards consistent. 
OSHA has reviewed all of its other 
standards, and the possible impact of 
aligning the HCS with the GHS on those 
rules. The Agency is proposing changes 
to some of these other rules, and 
discusses elsewhere in this preamble 
the actions it has determined are 
appropriate to address this issue. 
Combustible dust. In the ANPR, 
OSHA asked for comments on the scope 
of health and physical hazards covered 
by the HCS and the GHS. In response, 
several commenters addressed the issue 
of combustible dust. There is no specific 
definition of combustible dust in the 
HCS, nor is there one in the GHS. A 
number of explosions have occurred in 
workplaces due to an accumulation of 
combustible dust. The U.S. Chemical 
Safety and Hazard Investigation Board 
(CSB) has investigated these explosions, 
and made recommendations to OSHA 
regarding a number of actions it should 
undertake (Document ID # 0110). CSB 
found that hazard communication 
regarding such dusts was inadequate, 
and is recommending the following 
with regard to this rulemaking: 
The CSB therefore recommends that OSHA 
amend the HCS to explicitly address the fire 
and explosion hazards of combustible dusts, 
and those materials that could reasonably be 
expected to produce combustible dusts, 
among the substances covered by the 
standard, and also that the Agency require 
inclusion of dust fires and explosions among 
the physical hazards that must be addressed 
in Material Safety Data Sheets. The CSB also 
requests that OSHA advocate similar changes 
to the GHS through appropriate international 
mechanisms. 
The Phylmar Group (Document ID # 
0080) noted that combustible dust is not 
specifically covered under the current 
HCS, but suggested that it should be a 
future revision to the GHS rather than 
an addition to the HCS at this point: 
Combustible dusts are not addressed in the 
current HCS or the GHS. Although we 
believe that combustible dusts should be 
addressed in future revisions of the GHS, we 
do not recommend that OSHA include them 
in this rulemaking, as it would not achieve 
the desired goal of global harmonization. We 
encourage OSHA to work with the UN to 
ensure that the hazards of combustible dusts 
are addressed in the future. 
The American Petroleum Institute 
also suggested that OSHA discuss with 
the UN how to handle the classification 
of explosive organic dusts (Document ID 
# 0171). Both Dr. Michele Sullivan and 
Organization Resources Counselors had 
similar comments which highlighted the 
hazards of combustible dusts, but 
suggested that OSHA explore ways this 
can be addressed on SDSs or in future 
GHS revisions rather than suggesting 
modification of the current HCS 
(Document ID #s 0145 and 0123). 
There are a number of activities 
ongoing in OSHA regarding combustible 
dust, including consideration of 
additional standards or regulations 
addressing this issue. Final decisions 
have not been made regarding such 
rulemaking. As noted by commenters, 
the HCS does not include an explicit 
definition of such dust. However, 
manufacturers and importers are 
required to perform a hazard evaluation 
and consider all scientific evidence to 
determine if their products present a 
hazard. 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(1) The 
hazard determination must anticipate 
the full range of downstream uses of a 
product including any by-products that 
may be generated during normal 
conditions of use. It has been the 
longstanding position of the Agency that 
the hazard determination covers dusts 
known to be subject to deflagration and 
subsequent explosion, i.e., combustible 
dusts. This information must be 
conveyed on the MSDS. 
Likewise, the GHS specifically 
addresses inclusion of information on 
the hazards associated with explosive 
(combustible) dusts in the SDS. This 
information would appear in Hazard 
Identification (Section 2) on the SDS as 
a hazard that does not result in 
classification under the current 
provisions of the GHS. This provision in 
the GHS is consistent with OSHA’s 
current coverage of combustible dusts 
and is included in the proposed 
modifications. In addition, as discussed 
above, OSHA has added a definition for 
unclassified hazards to the proposed 
rule to address hazards such as 
combustible dust that do not have 
specific criteria for classification in the 
current provisions. Under this 
definition, combustible dust would be 
covered as other hazardous chemicals 
are, including information on labels, 
SDSs, and in training. 
Additionally, the United States has 
submitted a working paper to propose 
that the UN Subcommittee add 
combustible dusts to their program of 
work, and has volunteered to lead this 
work. At such time as specific 
classification criteria for combustible 
dusts are added to the GHS, OSHA 
would also add them to the modified 
HCS. At this point, there are no agreed 
U.S. criteria to propose to the UN 
Subcommittee. OSHA invites comments 
on this issue, and specifically would 
like to learn what stakeholders believe 
would be an appropriate definition for 
combustible dust to add to the GHS as 
a physical hazard. 
Other comments related to hazard 
determination/classification. A number 
of commenters responded to OSHA’s 
specific questions related to hazard 
determination and classification, but 
few commented generally on the 
approach in the GHS and the HCS. The 
Refractory Ceramic Fibers Coalition 
provided a general discussion on hazard 
determination, and reached the same 
conclusion as OSHA regarding the 
contrast in the approaches (Document 
ID # 0030): 
The GHS and HCS hazard determination/ 
classification are self-classification processes, 
but the GHS process is more detailed and 
allows for closer scrutiny of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the available data. RCFC 
supports the GHS approach. While the HCS 
has a one positive study threshold, the GHS 
provides for the one positive study issue in 
the context of analysis of the weight of all of 
the available evidence. In vitro studies are 
treated specifically, and there is 
consideration of whether a substance is not 
bioavailable or is inextricably bound. 
Professional/expert judgment is included, 
human experience is taken into account, and 
negative findings and data which refute 
findings are considered. 
As described above, the existing HCS 
includes reference to several lists of 
chemicals in the hazard determination 
provisions that the Agency considers a 
‘‘floor’’ of chemicals that are to be 
considered hazardous under all 
circumstances. The lists were also 
referred to in the mixture provisions— 
requiring mixtures to be covered when 
components could exceed established or 
recommended exposure limits even 
when present in concentrations below 
the mixture cut-offs. Inclusion of the 
floor and the mixture provisions in the 
revised rule were raised as an issue for 
comment in the ANPR, and a number of 
responses were received. Opinions on 
these issues varied significantly. 
A number of commenters thought the 
revised rule should take the same 
approach as the existing rule (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0044, 0057, 0078, 0021, 
0029, 0116, and 0149). On the other 
hand, some respondents did not support 
the inclusion of any additional lists, and 
several noted that the GHS does not 
include such an approach, and thus the 
revised rule should not either since it is 
being aligned with the GHS (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0046, 0047, 0049, 0058, 
0064, 0036, 0107, 0123, and 0171). 
Others objected to the process by which 
TLVs are determined and/or suggested

50396 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
that it is not legal for OSHA to refer to 
TLVs (Document ID #s 0064, 0083, 
0100, 0101, 0111, 0132, and 0141). 
As OSHA noted in the ANPR, the 
more detailed hazard classification 
provisions in the GHS preclude the 
need for a floor and for the mixture 
provisions related to exposure limits. 
The current HCS does not provide a 
specific and detailed approach to hazard 
determination or classification of 
hazards, and thus there was concern 
during its promulgation about the 
relative ability of chemical 
manufacturers and importers to follow a 
performance-oriented approach and 
reach the same conclusions. The floor of 
chemicals, as well as the mixture 
provisions, reflected this concern by 
providing additional guidance regarding 
the types of chemicals that would be 
considered hazardous were an 
appropriate hazard determination 
conducted. The proposed modifications 
provide a specific and detailed 
approach, and thus this additional 
guidance is no longer necessary or 
appropriate. OSHA believes that the 
detailed and specific criteria would 
provide equal or improved protection 
for exposed employees since they would 
improve consistency in evaluations, as 
well as help to ensure a thorough and 
comprehensive classification. In 
addition, as noted by some commenters, 
the GHS itself does not include such 
lists, so including them in the revised 
HCS would be a deviation from the 
harmonized approach. Such a deviation 
would detract from the benefits of 
adopting a harmonized approach. 
OSHA has thus decided to delete 
references to any lists in the hazard 
classification provisions being 
proposed. The Agency believes that the 
proposed revised criteria accomplish a 
similar purpose in ensuring a 
consistency in approach to classification 
by various manufacturers of the same 
product, and does not think these 
provisions are needed in the proposed 
standard for this purpose. Furthermore, 
the GHS does not include a floor list of 
this type, and maintaining such 
provisions in the proposed revisions 
would be a significant deviation from 
the harmonized approach. 
A few commenters argued that the 
hazard classification approach in the 
GHS would result in chemical 
manufacturers testing or re-testing their 
products (Document ID #s 0061, 0178, 
0022, and 0141). If manufacturers 
choose to test or re-test their products, 
it will not be a result of either the 
provisions of the GHS or those proposed 
for the revised HCS. The GHS does not 
require testing, and neither does the 
HCS. Both are based on available data. 
This has always been the case for the 
HCS, and is now explicitly addressed in 
the revised text to ensure it is 
understood by all stakeholders. 
There were some other comments that 
noted concerns about the effects of the 
classification criteria on a specific 
chemical or product, or which noted the 
potential for a change in classification 
or the need for additional guidance or 
interpretation. Since OSHA had not 
actually proposed language or coverage 
for the rule in the ANPR, some of these 
concerns were based on assumptions 
about what requirements would be 
included in a revised HCS and thus 
should be re-considered in the context 
of this proposal. As noted in the 
discussion on outreach and compliance 
assistance, OSHA is open to suggestions 
regarding areas where help will be 
needed, and classification has already 
been highlighted as an area of concern. 
One interesting comment that was 
submitted by a number of respondents 
involved development of a classification 
data base (Document ID #s 0047, 0050, 
0053, 0054, 0038, 0155, 0160, and 
0165). Opinions as to who would 
develop and maintain such a data base 
varied (OSHA, U.S. industry, and an 
international body were all mentioned). 
During the development of the GHS, 
chemical industry representatives did 
not generally support inclusion of such 
a list or data base of classified 
chemicals. It appears that the European 
Union will be making such a data base 
available for compliance with its 
requirements, as have Japan, Taiwan, 
Korea, and New Zealand. Concerns are 
now being raised by stakeholders that 
classifications in these data bases are 
different for the same chemical. 
Development and maintenance of 
such a data base would be a significant 
undertaking for any entity, although the 
appeal of such an approach is obvious. 
The appearance of differing 
classifications in national data bases is 
certainly a concern. One development 
that impacts this issue is that the 
International Chemical Safety Cards 
distributed by the International Program 
on Chemical Safety are being updated to 
be consistent with the GHS, and will 
thus have classifications for over one 
thousand commodity chemicals. Several 
hundred have already been completed. 
NIOSH represents the U.S. in this 
activity (Document ID # 0082), and the 
cards are available on their Web site 
(which is linked on OSHA’s Web site). 
These cards are available in multiple 
languages, and are internationally 
developed and peer reviewed. Thus 
they will provide a data base on an 
international level for a core group of 
widely available chemicals when the 
update is completed. 
The issue of a data base is one which 
needs to be explored more fully, and the 
logistics and implications studied. It has 
been raised as an issue for consideration 
by the UN Subcommittee as well. OSHA 
invites further comment on how such an 
approach might be further developed. 
(e) Written hazard communication 
program. The GHS does not include 
provisions for a written hazard 
communication program. Thus the 
provisions of this paragraph are not 
directly affected by implementation of 
the GHS. The only changes proposed 
align terminology, i.e., the proposal uses 
the term ‘‘safety data sheet’’ rather than 
‘‘material safety data sheet.’’ 
The written hazard communication 
program requirements are intended to 
ensure that the approach to hazard 
communication in a given workplace is 
coordinated and comprehensive. The 
program includes a list of the hazardous 
chemicals known to be present in the 
workplace. This list is basically an 
inventory of the chemicals the employer 
must have safety data sheets for—and is 
accessible to employees so they, too, can 
determine what chemicals should be 
included under the hazard 
communication programs in their 
workplace. The list can be maintained 
by work area or for the workplace as a 
whole, and can be kept by the 
‘‘identity’’ of the chemicals (which 
would be the product identifier under 
the proposed rule). In other words, the 
inventory can be common names or 
product names, rather than individual 
chemical ingredients of each product by 
specific chemical identity or chemical 
name. 
In addition to the list, the HCS 
requires the employer’s program to set 
forth how hazard communication will 
be implemented in the workplace. This 
includes how the standard’s 
requirements for labels, SDSs, and 
training will be met; how the hazards of 
non-routine tasks will be addressed; and 
how hazard communication will be 
handled in a multi-employer workplace 
situation. OSHA has provided guidance 
over the years on completing a written 
program, and there are many sample 
programs in circulation. The program 
need not be lengthy or complicated, but 
should have enough detail to provide 
the reader with a blueprint of the 
workplace-specific program. 
Several comments were received from 
the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) and others that suggested there 
would be significant burdens associated 
with revising the written program as a

50397 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 188 / Wednesday, September 30, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
and 0164). Revising the chemical 
inventory was cited by these 
commenters as one aspect that was 
likely to be burdensome. Since the 
chemical inventory is basically a list of 
the products an employer has in the 
workplace that are considered 
hazardous, the only way this list would 
change as a result of implementing the 
GHS would be if something that was not 
hazardous before is now, or vice versa. 
OSHA believes that this is not a 
significant concern for three reasons. 
First, it would be unusual for a chemical 
to only have one hazardous effect 
associated with it so that the overall 
determination of hazard would be 
affected by a change in classification in 
one hazard class. Secondly, because 
HCS currently covers hazardous 
chemicals, unless the chemical is new, 
it is highly probable that it is already 
covered. Third, as discussed above in 
relation to the scope paragraph, OSHA 
does not believe that the scope of 
hazards covered by the GHS, and thus 
the proposal, is substantially different 
than the current HCS. 
The most likely differences resulting 
from re-classification under the revised 
standard is that a chemical would be 
placed in a category under a hazard 
class that does not currently include 
categories. It may also be possible that 
a chemical may fall into a different 
category where there are already defined 
categories (such as flammability). 
Neither of these differences would 
necessitate a change in the inventory. 
With regard to other changes in the 
program, it does not appear likely there 
would be many, if any at all. Written 
programs usually describe aspects such 
as who in the organization is 
responsible for implementing different 
parts of the program, or the type of in- 
plant labeling system used. The revised 
HCS need not affect these aspects at all. 
Therefore, OSHA does not believe that 
extensive revisions would have to be 
made to written programs, including the 
inventory, under the proposal. 
Suggestions have been made by SBA 
and others for outreach products related 
to the written program, particularly for 
an online inventory tool (Document ID 
#s 0022 and 0027). Given that the 
inventory is a simple list, it does not 
appear that anything other than a word 
processing program would be required 
to generate this part of the program so 
OSHA is not certain what is being 
suggested by these stakeholders. OSHA 
does not believe that a tool that lists all 
hazardous chemicals, and allows 
employers to check off those they have 
in their workplace, would be feasible 
given the extensive number of products 
currently in use in American 
workplaces. Therefore, if this is what is 
being suggested, it is not likely to be 
provided. 
OSHA is thus not proposing any 
substantive modifications to the written 
hazard communication program, and 
does not anticipate any significant new 
burdens associated with revising the 
program as a result of other 
modifications being proposed. 
(f) Labels and other forms of warning. 
The HCS is designed to provide 
information through three different 
media: labels or other forms of 
immediate warning; safety data sheets; 
and training. Labels are attached to the 
container of chemicals, and thus 
provide the information that employees 
have the most ready access to in the 
workplace. Given that they are attached 
to containers, they are by necessity 
somewhat limited in the amount of 
information they can present. The labels 
thus provide a snapshot or brief 
summary of the more detailed 
information provided to employees in 
training programs, or available to them 
on safety data sheets. They are not 
intended to be a complete or detailed 
source of information on the chemical. 
In the current HCS, the requirements 
for labels are performance-oriented. At 
the time the standard was promulgated, 
there were many different types of 
labels in use. A common label format 
used by industry was that provided by 
the ANSI Z129, Hazardous Industrial 
Chemicals—Precautionary Labeling 
standard. Employers following this 
format at the time provided a number of 
different types of information on the 
chemicals involved. However, there 
were two areas where employers were 
inconsistent or did not necessarily 
provide what was needed when 
following the national consensus 
standard. The first was provision of an 
identity on the label that could lead a 
chemical user to the specific chemical 
identities for the hazardous ingredients. 
It was common practice to provide a 
trade name for a product, but not the 
names of ingredients, on either the label 
or the safety data sheet. The second was 
provision of specific information on the 
hazards involved, such as the target 
organ affected. 
The current HCS label provisions 
focus on this typically missing 
information. On shipped containers, 
chemical manufacturers or importers are 
required to include an identity, and 
appropriate hazard warnings, as well as 
their name and address or that of a 
responsible party. The term ‘‘identity’’ 
is defined in the HCS definitions 
paragraph (c) as ‘‘any chemical or 
common name which is indicated on 
the material safety data sheet (MSDS) 
for the chemical. The identity used shall 
permit cross-references to be made 
among the required list of hazardous 
chemicals, the label and the MSDS.’’ 
The hazard warning is to provide 
specific information about the health or 
physical hazards posed by the chemical. 
The term is defined as ‘‘any words, 
pictures, symbols, or combination 
thereof appearing on a label or other 
appropriate form of warning which 
convey the specific physical and health 
hazard(s), including target organ effects, 
of the chemical(s) in the container(s). 
(See the definitions for ‘physical hazard’ 
and ‘health hazard’ to determine the 
hazards which must be covered.)’’ 
Similarly, the requirements for in- 
plant containers specify an identity and 
appropriate hazard warning. OSHA has 
taken a flexible approach to in-plant 
labeling, allowing a wide variety of 
systems to be used as long as all of the 
required information is readily available 
to employees when they are in their 
work areas. Thus employers were able 
to continue using existing systems such 
as the Hazardous Materials Information 
System (HMIS) and the National Fire 
Protection Association (NFPA) labeling 
systems that use numerical rankings of 
hazard. 
The labeling provisions of the current 
HCS exemplify the overall performance 
orientation of the rule. They establish 
the basic information requirements for 
chemical manufacturers and importers, 
but do not specify a format, or any 
particular label elements to be used. As 
a result, labels are often quite different 
when the same chemical is addressed by 
different suppliers, creating the 
potential for employee confusion. While 
many manufacturers follow the ANSI 
national consensus standard, others do 
not. Large manufacturers have 
frequently developed their own libraries 
or repositories of standard phrases, with 
decision logics for when to apply them 
to convey a hazard or a precaution. 
Therefore, not only does this approach 
lead to labels that are different, it also 
results in a large duplication of effort by 
chemical manufacturers developing 
their own systems. 
This performance-oriented approach 
also did not lend itself to 
harmonization. Other countries often 
use more specific approaches, including 
assignment of standard phrases to 
certain hazardous effects, symbols, and 
other label elements. It was clear that 
the performance orientation of HCS, 
with its many acceptable varieties of 
labels, could not be standardized 
through agreement on content to 
achieve harmonization. 
Given that a more specified approach 
would also lead to consistency among

manufacturers, as well as helping to 
ensure the same message is received by 
all exposed employees, OSHA agreed to 
negotiate a harmonized approach that 
was more specific than the current 
standard. This was also agreed to by 
stakeholder representatives involved in 
the negotiations. Thus once a chemical 
is classified as to its hazard classes and 
corresponding categories, the GHS 
specifies exactly what information is to 
appear on a label for that chemical. As 
described in Part V of this preamble, 
OSHA believes that these specific 
labeling requirements will be more 
protective of employee health and safety 
than the current performance-oriented 
standard. 
Paragraph (f) thus has more proposed 
modifications than most of the other 
paragraphs of the existing standard. The 
title of paragraph (f)(1) has been 
changed to indicate it addresses labels 
on shipped containers. The required 
information on these labels includes: 
product identifier, signal word, hazard 
statement(s), pictogram(s), 
precautionary statement(s), and the 
name, address and telephone number of 
the chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
other responsible party. 
The proposal thus would require that 
labels on shipped containers contain 
much more information than under the 
current standard. However, much of this 
additional information has already been 
included by manufacturers, particularly 
when following the ANSI standard for 
precautionary labeling. In addition, the 
OSHA requirements are intended to be 
the minimum information to be 
provided by manufacturers and 
importers. Under the GHS, as well as 
the current HCS and the proposal, 
chemical manufacturers and importers 
are free to provide additional 
information regarding the hazardous 
chemical and precautions for safe 
handling and use. The GHS and the 
proposal refer to this as supplemental 
information. Several commenters 
requested that this be permitted 
(Document ID #s 0132 and 0145). 
Paragraph (f)(2) addresses labeling for 
unclassified hazards. As noted 
previously, the proposal ensures that 
unclassified hazards (such as 
combustible dusts and simple 
asphyxiants) will continue to be covered 
under the HCS. That means that hazard 
information will have to appear on the 
SDS, and in certain cases, the label. As 
there are, however, no harmonized 
labeling elements available for 
unclassified hazards, the agency 
requires the responsible party to 
determine what information will be 
included on the label. This evaluation is 
to be based on the product’s hazards 
and exposures under normal conditions 
of use and foreseeable emergencies. 
Hazard information will be included on 
the label, as appropriate, under 
supplemental information, as well as 
appropriate precautionary measures for 
the safe handling and use of the 
chemical. 
Paragraph (f)(3) elaborates the label 
requirements by stating that the 
required information will be taken from 
new Appendix C of the standard on 
Allocation of Label Elements, which 
incorporates the GHS labeling 
requirements. This Appendix specifies 
the signal word, hazard statement, 
pictogram, and precautionary 
statements for each hazard class and 
category. It also includes a few basic 
rules about preparing labels that address 
precedence of hazards and other topics. 
Thus once a hazard classification is 
completed, the chemical manufacturer 
or importer can refer to Appendix C to 
determine what information must be 
included on the label. 
In addition to requiring that the 
information be taken from Appendix C, 
new paragraph (f)(4) also notes that the 
harmonized information must be 
located together on the label, tag, or 
mark, prominently displayed, and in 
English, although other languages may 
also be included if appropriate. 
The rest of paragraph (f) in the current 
standard remains largely the same in the 
proposed modified text, although 
conforming changes to terminology are 
made throughout the paragraph. The 
current standard’s accommodation for 
labels associated with solid metal is 
maintained in the revised text, as is the 
provision regarding conflicts with 
requirements of the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. In fact, since transport 
rules have been harmonized with the 
other sectors under the GHS, the 
possibility of a conflict in information is 
less likely when the HCS is consistent 
with the international approach. Two 
commenters specifically noted that 
OSHA should avoid conflict with DOT 
(Document ID #s 0064 and 0066). This 
is already addressed in the standard 
(currently paragraph (f)(3) and 
contained in proposed paragraph (f)(6)). 
They further noted that the exterior 
package should be for displaying DOT 
labels, rather than for OSHA labels. In 
general, this would be true, although 
there are some cases where the only 
container serves as both the shipping 
container and the workplace container, 
such as drums. In these situations, there 
are rules in the GHS regarding which 
pictograms take precedence and the 
ways in which to display the 
information. These rules are in 
Appendix C of this proposed rule. 
Under new paragraph (f)(7), OSHA 
addresses workplace labeling in the 
proposed text. As noted previously, the 
current standard provides employers 
with flexibility regarding the type of 
system to be used in their workplaces. 
Some comments suggested that OSHA 
maintain this flexibility in the revised 
standard (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0047, 0145, and 0157). OSHA agrees, 
and the revised text maintains this 
flexibility by indicating that the 
employer can choose to label workplace 
containers either with the same label 
that would be on shipped containers for 
the chemical under the revised rule, or 
with label alternatives that meet the 
requirements for the standard. It should 
be noted that while alternatives are 
permitted, the information must be 
consistent with the revised HCS. Hazard 
classifications must be revised as 
necessary to conform, and the other 
information provided must be revised to 
ensure the appropriate message is 
conveyed. 
OSHA is not proposing to modify the 
remaining paragraphs on labels in the 
current HCS, including those that deal 
with alternatives to affixing labels to 
stationary containers; labeling of 
portable containers where the materials 
are transferred from a labeled container, 
used within a workshift, and under the 
control of the employee who performs 
the transfer; ensuring that all containers 
in the workplace have a label; a 
requirement for workplace labels to be 
in English and prominently displayed, 
while allowing the information to be in 
other languages as well; and the 
requirement for updating label 
information when there is new and 
significant information regarding the 
hazards of a chemical. 
Several comments raised an issue 
regarding potential confusion resulting 
from the numbering of hazard categories 
in the GHS (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0046, 0054, 0064, 0035, 0123, and 
0146). As described in the GHS text, 
some of the hazard classes that are 
divided into categories use numbers to 
designate those categories. Chemicals 
posing the most serious hazards are 
assigned to Category 1, and higher 
category numbers denote less serious 
hazards. Labels prepared under the 
Hazardous Materials Information 
System (HMIS) and National Fire 
Protection Association (NFPA) systems, 
on the other hand, use higher numbers 
to indicate more severe hazards. It was 
argued that the different approaches 
would result in confusion and lead to 
hazardous conditions in the workplace. 
OSHA recognizes that the approach to 
numbering hazard categories in the GHS 
differs from that used in the HMIS and

NFPA systems. However, the Agency 
does not believe that this will result in 
confusion. GHS category numbers 
determine the label elements that would 
be required for a chemical, but the 
category numbers themselves would not 
appear on labels. Where GHS category 
numbers would appear on the SDS 
(Section 2—Hazards identification), 
they would be accompanied by the label 
elements for the chemical, which would 
clearly indicate the degree of hazard. 
OSHA, therefore, does not anticipate 
that this information will cause 
employees to become confused. 
Moreover, the approach taken in the 
GHS (i.e., assigning higher category 
numbers to denote less serious hazards) 
is consistent with the approach used in 
the DOT transport regulations for many 
years. 
A few commenters also argued that a 
small package exemption, or some type 
of prioritization of information on small 
packages, should be permitted 
(Document ID #s 0043, 0046, and 0080). 
The current HCS does not have such an 
exemption or limitation, but the Agency 
has allowed practical accommodations 
in those situations where an issue has 
occurred. In Revision 3 of the GHS, 
some provisions regarding small 
package labels have been included 
(1.4.10.5.4.4, Labelling of small 
packagings). The competent authority is 
given the discretion to implement 
changes that allow label preparers to 
reduce the required information to 
accommodate a small package size. 
OSHA is not proposing to adopt such a 
provision, and intends to continue its 
current approach regarding small 
packages. Very small packagings are less 
frequent in the workplace than in 
consumer settings, and it is difficult to 
argue that employees should get less 
information just because of the size of 
the package. The practical 
accommodation approach OSHA has 
been utilizing addresses those situations 
where there is a valid issue, and ensures 
that workers receive all of the required 
information. 
Some comments addressed objections 
to the specific labeling requirements for 
certain chemicals. For example, the 
National Propane Gas Association 
(Document ID # 0068) objected to 
labeling propane as being ‘‘extremely’’ 
flammable, stating that it is usually 
simply addressed as ‘‘flammable’’ in the 
U.S. In addition, The Fertilizer Institute 
(Document ID # 0045) objected to 
having the skull and crossbones on 
labels for anhydrous ammonia, stating 
that use of it in fertilizers is necessary 
for the food supply. Similarly, an 
argument is made by the Styrene 
Information and Research Center 
(Document ID # 0164) that no GHS 
Category 2 carcinogens should be 
labeled because it would result in more 
chemicals being classified as 
carcinogens than would be under the 
International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (IARC) criteria. 
Adoption of the GHS is likely to result 
in a number of situations where current 
labeling practices are somewhat 
changed by the introduction of the 
concept of severity of hazard, and the 
use of different label elements to convey 
information. OSHA does not believe 
that it would be appropriate to designate 
substance-specific exemptions from 
classification for reasons unrelated to 
communication of hazards. In the case 
of propane, designating it as ‘‘extremely 
flammable’’ is actually already done by 
a number of manufacturers or 
distributors in the U.S., so it is not 
necessarily a departure from current 
practice. In addition, NPGA’s argument 
that many propane distributors are 
small businesses who don’t participate 
in international trade (Document ID # 
0068), is not related to improving and 
enhancing the communication of 
hazards to employees in the U.S. 
Provision of an exemption for those 
engaged solely in domestic commerce 
would only increase employee 
confusion about hazardous chemicals in 
the workplace. Providing information 
about the degree of hazard will help to 
ensure that the material is handled with 
the proper care needed to prevent 
hazardous effects from occurring. 
Similarly, the fact that anhydrous 
ammonia is used for the food supply 
ignores the significant hazards this 
chemical poses to workers who handle 
it. The skull and crossbones will 
emphasize the degree of severity of the 
hazard, as well as communicate the 
hazard to individuals who do not read 
or speak English—many of whom work 
in the agriculture industry. 
In addition, the mere fact that 
incorporation of the GHS criteria might 
change the number of chemicals 
classified is not a reason to disregard the 
carcinogens in Category 2. The IARC 
criteria were one of the primary sources 
used for development of the GHS 
criteria, so it does not appear that there 
is a significant difference in approach. 
OSHA has had an enforcement 
interpretation that would allow 
manufacturers of certain carcinogens, 
those in IARC Category IIB, to include 
information about their carcinogenicity 
on the safety data sheet but not the 
label. Such an interpretation would not 
be consistent with GHS, and is not 
included in the proposed provisions. 
Therefore, there may be some chemicals 
that will now have carcinogen labels in 
addition to SDS information as a result 
of implementation of the GHS. This will 
ensure that employees get consistent 
information about these chemicals from 
all suppliers. Furthermore, because the 
current HCS uses the one study 
criterion, it appears that more chemicals 
are currently covered under the HCS 
than under any other criteria applied. 
A few comments were received 
regarding EPA labels for pesticides, 
noting that signal words in these labels 
would change if GHS is adopted 
(Document ID # 0178), and noting that 
the requirements for these labels are 
dictated by the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA), and also control the SDS 
content (Document ID # 0108). A 
commenter also argued that pesticide 
labels are more useful because they are 
risk-based rather than hazard-based 
(Document ID # 0108). OSHA believes 
these concerns are not related to the 
proposal. The revised HCS would 
maintain the exemption for additional 
labels on containers that are labeled in 
accordance with EPA requirements. If 
EPA decides to adopt the GHS, then 
labels for pesticides would be consistent 
with OSHA labels on other types of 
products. With regard to SDSs, these are 
required by the HCS, not FIFRA, and 
therefore such SDSs must be consistent 
with GHS provisions under these 
proposed changes. 
While the GHS specifies the 
information to be placed on a label, it 
does not provide a specific format for 
placement, which is similar to current 
HCS requirements. It was noted that 
GHS does not specify a location or size 
of core information on a shipment 
(Document ID # 0066). OSHA believes 
that this is best left in a performance- 
oriented provision, allowing 
accommodations to be made as long as 
the information is located together, and 
is prominently displayed as required. 
Other commenters noted that 
changing labels will create confusion 
and additional burden (Document ID #s 
0065 and 0146); that there may be two 
labels and SDSs during the transition 
period, and that would be confusing 
(Document ID # 0035); and that the 
diamond shape of the pictogram was 
similar to NFPA’s diamond, and 
therefore confusing (Document ID # 
0035). It is clear that a change in labels 
will require a period of transition where 
there may be some confusion, and there 
will be two types of labels in the 
workplace. However, when the GHS is 
completely implemented, the current 
widespread confusion resulting from 
allowing multiple labeling approaches 
will be eliminated. Comprehensibility 
and effectiveness of hazard

communication is expected to increase 
as a result. OSHA believes these long- 
term benefits outweigh the short-term 
transitional issues. As discussed above, 
commenters in general recognized the 
benefits of adoption of the GHS, 
including enhancement of current 
protections, and thus supported 
pursuing this rulemaking. (See, e.g., 
Document ID#s 0046, 0047, 0054, 0059, 
0064, 0081, 0034, 0038, 0158, and 
0165). 
There were a few commenters who 
wanted additional elements in the 
labeling system, such as the water- 
reactive pictogram so it could be posted 
on buildings for fire authorities 
(Document ID # 0029), and a numerical 
ranking system similar to those 
currently in use under voluntary 
systems (Document ID # 0013). In the 
case of the water-reactive pictogram, 
there is certainly nothing in the current 
HCS or in the GHS that precludes its use 
to mark buildings, but that is a purpose 
that is outside the scope of the system 
at this point. In terms of the numerical 
ranking system, the GHS was developed 
based on consideration of existing 
national and regional hazard 
communication systems, and none of 
those currently employ a numerical 
ranking system. Thus, such an approach 
was not considered in the process. 
(g) Safety data sheets. The proposed 
revisions to this paragraph are confined 
primarily to paragraph (g)(2), other than 
conforming terminology regarding 
classification and SDSs. Paragraph (g)(2) 
of the current HCS indicates what 
information must be included on an 
SDS. It does not specify a format for 
presentation, or an order of information. 
Chemical manufacturers and importers 
have been free to use whatever format 
they choose, as long as the information 
is provided. 
While this performance orientation 
was supported by chemical 
manufacturers when the standard was 
originally promulgated, this was largely 
based on those who were already 
providing SDSs and did not want to 
change their format. As the scope of the 
standard was expanded to cover other 
industries, it became clear that SDS 
users preferred an order of information 
or a format. In particular, stakeholders 
such as emergency responders were 
concerned that not being able to find 
information in the same place on every 
SDS could create an increased risk in 
situations where the information was 
needed quickly. 
Several years after the HCS was 
adopted, the chemical manufacturers 
themselves responded to these concerns 
by developing a national consensus 
standard that included a 16-section SDS 
(ANSI Z400). The titles of each section 
were established, as was the order of 
presentation. The standard sought to 
address concerns raised by also putting 
information of most use to those 
exposed in the beginning of the SDS, 
with the more technical data required 
by health and safety professionals in 
later sections. They also responded to 
comments that indicated the SDS 
should be essentially ‘‘one stop 
shopping’’ in terms of information on a 
chemical, and should include other 
information such as how it is regulated 
by other Federal agencies, including 
transport requirements and 
environmental information. 
In 1990, OSHA published a Request 
for Information (RFI) that addressed the 
issues of comprehensibility of labels 
and SDSs (55 FR 20580). There were 
nearly 600 comments received, and the 
majority of respondents sought an order 
of information or format for SDSs. Since 
the international harmonization process 
had begun at that point, OSHA thought 
it would be useful to wait until a 
globally harmonized SDS was available 
before changing the requirements. 
However, through interpretation, the 
ANSI format has been acceptable for 
many years, as long as the SDS includes 
the required information (see CPL 2– 
2.38D, the compliance directive for the 
HCS). As explained in Section V of this 
preamble, OSHA believes that the 
implementation of a standardized SDS 
format will enhance hazard 
communication and be more protective 
of employee health than the current 
performance-oriented standard. 
The 16-section format continued to be 
recognized in different countries and 
organizations over the years, including 
an International Labor Organization 
(ILO) recommendation on chemical 
safety, the European SDS requirements, 
and an International Standards 
Organization standard on SDSs. When 
the GHS was developed, it was decided 
that this 16-section format was already 
a de facto international approach, so it 
was adapted to be part of the GHS. One 
small change was made to reverse 
sections 2 and 3 to put hazard 
information before the chemical names 
of ingredients. This change has 
subsequently been adopted by ANSI and 
other groups to be consistent. 
Since the 16-section SDS was 
initiated in the U.S. by industry, many 
companies have been using it. This will 
reduce the impact of adopting the GHS 
requirements since the major 
changeover to that approach has already 
been made by those companies. Others 
who continued to use different formats 
will need to change their SDSs to 
conform. There is already software 
available in the 16-section format, and 
it is expected that more tools will be 
available as the effective dates for 
compliance approach. 
OSHA is proposing to modify 
paragraph (g)(2) to establish the section 
numbers and title headings of the 
sections of the SDS to be consistent with 
the GHS. Furthermore, a new Appendix 
D is being added to the standard to 
address safety data sheets, and it 
indicates what information must be 
included in each section. 
As OSHA indicated in the ANPR, 
there are several sections of the SDS that 
address information that is outside the 
Agency’s jurisdiction (see the list of 
sections below). OSHA will not be 
making these sections mandatory for 
inclusion, nor will any enforcement 
activity be directed to these sections. 
However, inclusion of the sections in an 
SDS is not precluded, and they have 
been included in the text of the revised 
standard so people will be aware that a 
fully GHS-compliant SDS will have to 
address those areas in addition to the 
ones mandated by OSHA. 
The revised SDS would require the 
following sections: 
Section 1. Identification 
Section 2. Hazard(s) identification. 
Section 3. Composition/Information on 
ingredients. 
Section 4. First-aid measures. 
Section 5. Fire-fighting measures. 
Section 6. Accidental release measures. 
Section 7. Handling and storage. 
Section 8. Exposure controls/personal 
protection. 
Section 9. Physical and chemical 
properties. 
Section 10. Stability and reactivity. 
Section 11. Toxicological information. 
Section 16. Other information, including 
date of preparation of the last revision. 
A note in the revised text addresses the 
other sections that are not mandatory for 
OSHA: 
Section 12. Ecological information. 
Section 13. Disposal considerations. 
Section 14. Transport information. 
Section 15. Regulatory information. 
The remainder of the paragraph on 
SDSs remains the same as the current 
HCS. The proposal retains the current 
HCS design, ensuring the downstream 
flow of information from the chemical 
manufacturer or importer to the 
distributor and ultimately the employer. 
Other provisions regarding completion 
of all sections of the SDS; provisions for 
complex mixtures; the requirement for 
information to be accurate and reflect 
the scientific evidence; the need to 
update the SDS when new and 
significant information is available; 
maintenance of SDSs so they are 
accessible to employees; 
accommodations for situations where

employees travel between workplaces 
during a workshift; and access for 
OSHA and NIOSH, remain as they are 
in the current standard. 
As was the case with labels, relatively 
few comments were submitted in 
response to the ANPR on the specific 
provisions for SDSs in the GHS. Those 
provisions are generally consistent with 
the current HCS, with the exception of 
the standardized approach described 
above that OSHA is proposing to 
include in the revised text. 
Comments were received on inclusion 
of exposure limits on SDSs, and a 
number of different opinions were 
expressed, particularly regarding TLVs 
being required. Many commenters 
argued that TLVs should be included on 
the SDSs as currently required under 
the HCS (see, e.g., Document ID #s 0042, 
0179, 0021, 0038, 0124, and 0149). 
Others suggested they should not be 
required (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0058, 0064, 0036, 0129, 0151, and 
0163). There were also a number of 
commenters that suggested other types 
of occupational exposure limits that 
should be included on SDSs, such as 
levels from other countries, those 
recommended by NIOSH, and those 
recommended by the American 
Industrial Hygiene Association (see, e.g., 
0044, 0077, 0018, 0024, 0109, 0147, and 
0171). OSHA has decided to maintain 
the requirement to include its 
mandatory permissible exposure limits 
(PELs) on the SDSs, and to specify, as 
in the existing HCS, that manufacturers 
should include ‘‘any other exposure 
limit used or recommended by the 
chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
employer preparing the safety data 
sheet.’’ This will allow inclusion of any 
of the different types of occupational 
exposure limits commenters 
recommended for inclusion where the 
SDS preparer deems it appropriate. It 
also helps to minimize differences 
between the U.S. and other countries by 
not providing (except for PELs) a list of 
U.S.-specific occupational exposure 
limits that must be included, yet 
provides protection for employees by 
allowing inclusion of various 
recommendations that will help 
employers design appropriate protective 
measures. 
Several commenters appear to believe 
that the GHS requires disclosure of all 
ingredients in a mixture, unlike the 
current rule that has percentage cut-offs 
(Document ID #s 0048, 0056, and 0064), 
and argue that the current rule’s 
approach should be maintained. In fact, 
the GHS approaches ingredient 
disclosure in a manner consistent with 
the current HCS, although the cut-offs 
may be different for the various health 
hazards covered. Similarly, it was 
suggested that there be a de minimis 
level below which SDSs would not be 
required (Document ID # 0178). This is 
already addressed by the cut-offs in the 
mixture classification provisions for 
each health hazard class. It was 
suggested that the GHS approach to 
ingredient disclosure would lead to 
more testing of chemicals (Document ID 
#s 0048 and 0056). This is not true as 
neither the current HCS nor the GHS 
require testing of any kind to be 
performed. 
A number of comments suggested 
specific information to be included on 
the SDS, such as the Chemical Abstracts 
Service Registry Number (Document ID 
# 0044); whether a chemical is an EPA 
hazardous waste (Document ID # 0059 
and 0108); control banding 
recommendations (Document ID # 
0081); lethal dose data (Document ID # 
0015); a miscellaneous section 
(Document ID # 0019); NFPA and HMIS 
ratings (Document ID # 0019); storage 
requirements (Document ID # 0019); 
reference to the DOT Emergency 
Response Guide (Document ID # 0019); 
and more spill cleanup and disposal 
information (Document ID # 0028). 
Much of this information is already 
included in the proposed SDS (such as 
the CAS Registry Number and lethal 
dose data). The other information noted 
could certainly be included in the SDS 
as additional information to that which 
is required by OSHA. The information 
referenced by these comments that falls 
under sections of the SDS that are not 
workplace-related (e.g., environmental 
and transport information) cannot be 
required by OSHA. The Agency would 
certainly not preclude inclusion of such 
information by SDS preparers 
voluntarily, or as a result of 
requirements at some time in the future 
by the other Agencies that do have 
responsibility for those subject areas. 
Several commenters noted that SDSs 
need to be written in plain language 
(Document ID #s 0044, 0010, and 0035). 
In general, the Agency agrees that SDSs 
should be written as plainly as possible 
while still conveying the required 
information to the intended audiences. 
As originally designed by ANSI, the 
sections in the beginning of the SDS are 
intended to be written in plain 
language, with fewer technical terms 
where possible. This information should 
be of immediate use in emergency 
situations for example. But many of the 
remaining sections of the SDS require 
technical information, and they are 
intended to be of use primarily to 
professionals designing protective 
measures or providing services such as 
medical surveillance to exposed 
employees. These sections need to 
retain their technical terminology in 
order to be useful to the professionals 
for these purposes. 
A number of the comments received 
dealt with the management of SDSs, 
rather than the specific requirements for 
preparing them. For example, one 
commenter said that there would be a 
large burden associated with sending 
letters to obtain new SDSs, tracking 
their receipt, and updating workplace 
data bases (Document ID # 0178). The 
proposal would employ the same 
approach as the current HCS for 
distribution of SDSs. During the phase- 
in period for the standard, chemical 
manufacturers, importers, and 
distributors will be required to send a 
new SDS with their next shipment of a 
chemical to their customers. In other 
words, employers should automatically 
receive new SDSs, just as they do now 
when an SDS is updated. There will still 
be a burden associated with updating 
workplace records, but since users are 
not required to solicit new SDSs, there 
will not be a burden of sending letters 
to suppliers and tracking receipt of the 
responses. Furthermore, the phase-in 
period should be long enough that there 
will be turnover of chemical supplies 
that necessitate a new shipment in most 
cases. 
Several commenters suggested that an 
online library of SDSs be created by 
OSHA (Document ID #s 0019, 0028, and 
0146). This is an approach that was 
investigated by OSHA in the past, and 
at that time, it was determined that it 
would not be feasible for the Agency to 
maintain a complete and up-to-date data 
base of all the SDSs in use in American 
workplaces. The number of SDSs 
involved is very large, and there is no 
way for the Agency to know about each 
SDS or when each is updated. OSHA 
believes this approach is still infeasible 
for the Agency. 
There appeared to be some concern 
about having two SDSs for the same 
product during the phase-in period, and 
how an employer would decide which 
takes precedence (Document ID # 0146). 
OSHA believes that the most recent 
version would be the one that takes 
precedence, and should be maintained 
in the workplace. It would not be 
necessary to maintain two versions for 
purposes of the proposed standard. 
There was also a comment regarding 
SDS management for construction sites, 
and the use of a FAXback system 
(Document ID # 0022). This is an issue 
that has long been addressed by OSHA 
in its compliance directive (CPL 2– 
2.38D), as well as in the standard itself 
(see paragraph (g)(8) of the existing 
HCS), with provisions for what would

be considered effective electronic access 
to SDSs. The proposed revisions to the 
rule do not change these requirements. 
(h) Employee information and 
training. The GHS does not include 
harmonized training requirements, but 
does recognize the important role that 
training plays in hazard 
communication. For example, 1.1.3.1.3 
of the GHS states: 
In the workplace, it is expected that all of 
the GHS elements will be adopted, including 
labels that have the harmonized core 
information under the GHS, and safety data 
sheets. It is also anticipated that this will be 
supplemented by employee training to help 
ensure effective communication. 
OSHA agrees that training is key to 
ensuring effective hazard 
communication. Under the current HCS, 
training is used to explain the label and 
SDS systems used in a workplace, as 
well as addressing the hazards of 
chemicals and protective measures. 
While the written information provided 
is clearly important, training is an 
opportunity to explain the data and 
helps to ensure that the messages are 
being received accurately so they can be 
acted on appropriately. (See Section V 
of this preamble.) 
The training provisions in the HCS do 
not need to be modified to be consistent 
with the GHS since it does not include 
such requirements. However, OSHA is 
proposing small revisions to track 
terminology used in other paragraphs, 
as well as to clarify the requirement to 
train on the details of the hazard 
communication program in (h)(3)(iv). 
While this has always been required in 
the HCS, OSHA believes that modifying 
the text slightly will convey the need to 
address both the labels that will arrive 
on shipped containers, as well as any 
workplace-specific system that the 
employer uses. In addition, the training 
on SDSs must include the order of 
information. So the revised text would 
read: 
The details of the hazard communication 
program developed by the employer, 
including an explanation of the labels 
received on shipped containers and the 
workplace labeling system used by their 
employer; the safety data sheets, including 
the order of information and how employees 
can obtain and use the appropriate hazard 
information. 
In addition, OSHA is proposing that 
employers train or re-train employees 
regarding the new labels and safety data 
sheets within two years after the rule is 
promulgated. The Agency believes that 
the training needs to be completed by 
the time employees begin to see labels 
and safety data sheets with the new 
information on them, rather than 
waiting until after the transition has 
been completed. Comment is invited on 
this approach. 
Some commenters noted that training 
would be required to ensure employees 
understand, in particular, the symbols 
and pictograms that will be used on 
labels. Some argued that the burden 
would be substantial given that all 
training would have to be revised, and 
the time and resources required would 
be significant (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0178 and 0153). However, many agreed 
that having a standardized approach to 
labels and SDSs will make training 
easier in the future than training under 
the current rule where chemical 
manufacturers and importers can use 
whatever formats they choose (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0042, 0072, 0077, and 
0030). 
Marshfield Clinic (Document ID # 
0028) noted that communication of 
information about chemicals and other 
hazardous substances: 
* * *[I]s one of the more difficult to get 
across to workers. It is very appreciated that 
OSHA is revisiting this. Standardization will 
greatly assist in giving workers a better 
understanding of the hazards they may 
encounter when working with chemicals and 
other hazardous substances. 
Similarly, Alcoa (Document ID # 
0042) suggested that: ‘‘A standardized 
format will simplify hazard 
communication training and the use of 
pictograms will alleviate some of the 
problems presented by poor language 
skills.’’ 
There were a few commenters who 
argued that the standardized approach 
either would not simplify training, or 
they did not know if it would (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0065 and 0078). 
Another noted that the current approach 
is fine for companies that are domestic 
only (Document ID # 0026). 
There were also many comments 
related to outreach that suggested 
compliance assistance in the area of 
employee training. As OSHA noted in 
the ANPR, the Agency is considering 
the development of generic training on 
symbols to make available to employers 
(71 FR 53624). OSHA has been working 
with NIOSH to prepare training on 
symbols and pictograms in particular 
(addressed by NIOSH in their comment 
at Document ID # 0082). However, it is 
expected that there will be other 
products related to training as well, both 
from OSHA and from the private sector. 
(i) Trade secrets. The current HCS 
includes provisions that define what 
can be considered trade secret 
information under the rule, as well as 
delineate the conditions under which 
this information must be disclosed to 
ensure the safety and health of exposed 
employees. These provisions were a 
significant focus of the original 
rulemaking on the HCS, and reflect the 
common law of the United States on 
this topic. In the years since the rule has 
been in effect, however, this issue has 
not been as important. Overall, since 
these provisions were promulgated, it 
appears that fewer claims of trade 
secrecy have been made, and fewer 
requests for trade secret disclosure have 
been received, than were anticipated 
during the rulemaking process. 
The negotiations for development of 
the GHS recognized at the outset that 
trade secrets—generally referred to 
internationally as confidential business 
information—would be an issue of 
concern. Guiding principles included 
the following: 
In relation to chemical hazard 
communication, the safety and health of 
workers, consumers and the public in 
general, as well as the protection of the 
environment, should be ensured while 
protecting confidential business information, 
as prescribed by the competent authorities. 
As the issue was considered further, 
it was recognized that laws regarding 
confidential business information were 
very much country-specific, and had a 
broader context than rules for 
classification and labeling. Such laws 
could not be modified or harmonized 
through the process of harmonizing 
classification and labeling. Thus it was 
determined that the GHS would 
recognize the importance of the issue, 
and provide principles for countries to 
follow when adopting the provisions. 
These principles are consistent with the 
approach already incorporated into the 
HCS. 
First, the type of information that can 
be considered confidential or trade 
secret is limited to the names of 
chemicals and their concentrations in 
mixtures. Under the current HCS, OSHA 
did not require that concentrations in 
mixtures be disclosed, and thus limited 
claims to specific chemical identities. 
This is the primary difference between 
the current rule and the proposed 
revisions to HCS. To be consistent with 
GHS, OSHA is proposing to add 
percentage composition information to 
the SDS. This introduces the possibility 
that trade secret claims will be made for 
this type of information, as well as 
specific chemical identities. Thus the 
proposal revises the text of the current 
rule to add consideration of percentage 
composition everywhere specific 
chemical identity is addressed in the 
provisions. 
The GHS further suggests that SDSs 
indicate when information has been 
withheld as confidential; that the 
information be disclosed to the 
competent authority upon request and

under condition of confidentiality; that 
the information must be disclosed in a 
medical emergency, with mechanisms 
to protect it while ensuring timely 
disclosure; that the information be 
disclosed in non-emergency situations, 
also under conditions of protecting 
confidentiality; and that the competent 
authority have procedures to deal with 
challenges to this process. All of these 
principles have already been included 
in the trade secret provisions of the 
HCS, and are maintained in the revised 
rule as previously promulgated. The 
proposed revisions simply conform 
terminology, and add text regarding 
percentage composition being subject to 
the same provisions as specific chemical 
identity. 
Very few comments on trade secrets 
or confidential business information 
were received in response to the ANPR. 
It was suggested that protection of 
confidential business information 
should be an implementation principle 
for the GHS modifications to HCS 
(Document ID #s 0072 and 0179), and 
that the current trade secret position 
should be retained (Document ID # 
0049). There was also a comment that 
indicated full disclosure of all 
ingredients should be required on the 
SDS unless the employer provides a 
justification to the Agency showing that 
a particular ingredient is a trade secret, 
and demonstrating that the economic 
damage of disclosure exceeds the 
damage associated with the potential 
health effects to exposed employees 
(Document ID # 0044). In addition, the 
National Paints and Coatings 
Association (NPCA) argued that the 
approaches to protection of confidential 
business information need to be 
harmonized (Document ID # 0050). As 
NPCA noted, different approaches may 
lead to development of different SDSs 
for various authorities. 
As noted above, laws regarding 
confidential business information are 
generally not specific to classification 
and labeling requirements, but rather 
reflect an overall approach of a country. 
It was not possible to change such laws 
through the harmonization of 
classification and labeling, and thus the 
limit of the agreement was to establish 
the principles already described. Those 
principles are consistent with law in the 
United States, and do not require any 
modifications to the current HCS 
approach to be consistent with the GHS. 
As implementation moves forward in 
different countries and regions, 
conformance to the GHS principles 
should lead to increased harmonization 
of approaches. This is an area that 
should be monitored to determine if 
further action can be defined and 
implemented. OSHA does not believe it 
would be prudent to implement changes 
in the approach to trade secret 
protection and disclosure before that 
time. 
(j) Effective dates. OSHA is proposing 
to require implementation of the 
revisions to the HCS in 3 years after the 
final rule is completed. Training would 
be required two years after the final 
rule, and all provisions would be 
implemented in 3 years. During the 
transition period, employers would be 
required to be in compliance with either 
the existing HCS or the modified GHS, 
or both. OSHA recognizes that hazard 
communication programs will go 
through a period of time where labels 
and safety data sheets under both 
standards will be present in the 
workplace. This will be considered 
acceptable, and employers are not 
required to maintain two sets of labels 
or safety data sheets for compliance 
purposes. However, given the 
longstanding requirements for a hazard 
communication program, there must be 
no time during the transition period 
when hazard communication is not in 
effect in the workplace, and information 
is not available under either the existing 
requirements or the new final standard 
for exposed employees. 
Many comments were received on the 
issue of phasing in the requirements of 
the GHS, as well as on current practices 
and time frames required for various 
activities. There was a wide variety of 
opinions, as well as a number of factors 
that commenters suggested should be 
considered in establishing effective 
dates. 
OSHA specifically requested input on 
the possibility of phasing in 
requirements based on the size of the 
business. While a few commenters 
supported this approach (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0022, 0144, 0146, and 
0151), many more indicated that this 
would not be appropriate (see, e.g., 
Document ID #s 0042, 0018, 0033, 0107, 
0116, 0123, 0147, 0154, and 0171). One 
reason given was that the supply chain 
may involve large businesses 
purchasing from small businesses, and 
thus they would need information from 
them in order to comply themselves 
(Document ID #s 0080 and 0123). 
There were also those who thought 
the phasing should be coordinated with 
other trading partners, particularly the 
European Union (Document ID #s 0072, 
0080, 0081, 0179, 0024, 0163, and 
0171). The European phasing is taking 
place over a long period of time because 
of the REACH requirements for 
chemicals that are going into effect. The 
long time periods being considered do 
not necessarily reflect a determination 
that the amount of time is needed just 
for compliance with GHS. Another 
suggestion that had support was to 
phase in substances first, and then cover 
mixtures, or to have a 3-step phase-in 
that includes intermediates before 
mixtures (see, e.g., Document ID #s 
0104, 0021, 0024, 0034, 0036, 0122, 
0141, and 0154). 
A number of other phasing 
approaches were also mentioned, 
including selecting the 200 most 
produced chemicals by weight and then 
sort them by hazard (Document ID # 
0139); examining the data available on 
the chemicals in determining which to 
do first (Document ID #s 0081 and 
0036); basing it on the time to use up 
stockpiles (Document ID # 0022); and 
‘‘sufficient’’ time to work through the 
supply chain (Document ID #s 0068 and 
0122). 
There were also suggestions for a 
specific number of years, or a range of 
years. Some of these suggested less than 
3 years (see, e.g., Document ID #s 0064, 
0019, and 0028). A number suggested 3 
to 5 years, or in some cases, 6 years (see, 
e.g., Document ID #s 0042, 0046, 0104, 
0015, 0032, 0038, 0111, 0125, and 
0163). And there were some 
commenters who suggested anywhere 
from 7 to 13 years for full compliance 
(see, e.g., Document ID #s 0050, 0077, 
0078, 0018, 0116, 0129, 0141, and 
0164). 
OSHA decided on the 3-year proposal 
based on a consideration of the widely 
diverse viewpoints expressed, as well as 
information provided by commenters 
about stockpiles and other issues. It is 
clear that activities have already begun 
by a number of vendors of software 
programs for hazard classification and 
labeling to convert to the GHS and make 
programs available for companies to use 
to comply with requirements around the 
world as countries adopt the GHS. This 
work is already underway, and by the 
time this rulemaking is finalized, it is 
expected that much of it will be 
completed. And there were commenters 
that indicated that work is already being 
done in their companies to comply, 
particularly those that are multinational. 
(See Section VII for an analysis of 
activities already underway.) 
While the Agency wants to provide 
sufficient time for compliance, there is 
also a concern about the effect on 
employees of dealing with multiple 
systems during a transition period. 
While some time period when the 
currently required labels and the new 
GHS labels will co-exist is inevitable, 
the longer this period continues, the less 
effective the communication to 
employees will be. It is therefore 
important to minimize the effects of the

transition on the effectiveness of hazard 
communication by ensuring that is 
completed in a timely fashion, while 
allowing adequate time for an orderly 
changeover. 
Requiring the phasing in of 
substances first, and then mixtures, 
clearly has some persuasive logic as an 
approach. However, the supply chain is 
not always orderly and logical. It cannot 
be assumed, for example, that no 
mixtures can be completed until all 
substances are done. Mixtures that are 
comprised of substances that are widely 
available, and their hazards are well 
known, do not need an extensive time 
period to complete. Some mixtures are 
comprised of other mixtures rather than 
substances, and producers of such 
mixtures will need information on the 
component mixtures before they can 
comply. Waiting till the end of an 
extensive time period to complete their 
work may not allow them to meet the 
compliance dates. These types of issues 
are generally addressed by the market, 
and the needs of a manufacturer’s 
customers, and cannot be individually 
addressed in a phasing-in period. 
Further comment on this issue would be 
helpful to determine whether the final 
rule should include such phasing by 
type of product. 
Other Standards Affected by the GHS 
Modification to the HCS 
OSHA has reviewed all its standards 
and is proposing to modify standards in 
General Industry (29 CFR part 1910), 
Construction (29 CFR part 1926), and 
Shipyards, Marine Terminals and 
Longshoring (29 CFR parts 1915, 1917 
and 1918) that contain hazard 
classification and communication 
provisions in order that they will be 
internally consistent and aligned with 
the GHS modifications to the HCS. 
There is strong support in the record for 
including these OSHA standards in this 
rulemaking. 
The issue of how to deal with OSHA’s 
existing standards was raised in the 
ANPR. (71 FR 53617; Sept. 12, 2006). 
OSHA specifically requested input on 
how GHS provisions addressing 
classification of physical hazards such 
as flammable liquids would impact 
other OSHA standards. OSHA also 
asked whether physical hazard 
definitions in other standards should be 
changed at the same time as HCS (71 FR 
at 53623, 53626). 
In response to the ANPR, the majority 
of commenters who addressed the 
impact of the GHS on other OSHA 
standards recommended the Agency 
review all its standards and update 
them for consistency with GHS 
(Document ID #s 0046, 0050, 0054, 
0072, 0077, 0179, 0031, 0038, 0107, 
0116, 0145, 0147, 0154, 0155, 0163, 
0165, and 0171). Abbott Laboratories 
addressed the issue in terms of 
substance specific standards: 
OSHA should conduct a complete review 
of substance specific standards and 
determine how they need to be changed in 
order to be consistent with GHS. These 
changes should be made concurrent with the 
implementation of GHS. (Document ID # 
0046) 
Other commenters agreed, urging 
OSHA to complete these revisions in 
one rulemaking. (Document ID #s 0079, 
0123, 0137, 0154, and 0157). For 
example, the National Paint & Coatings 
Association, whose members produce 
up to 70,000 formulated products, urged 
OSHA to update the standards impacted 
by the GHS modification to the HCS to 
‘‘minimize discrepancies and 
inconsistency’’. (Document ID # 0050). 
Similar views were expressed by the 
Marshfield Clinic, the Hazard 
Communication Group and BASF 
(Document ID #s 0028, 0154, 0119, 
0145, and 0155). NIOSH supported 
OSHA’s plan to ‘‘adopt the specific 
labeling requirement and the safety data 
sheet (SDS) order of information’’ in the 
GHS, which, if substance specific 
standards were not included, would 
lead to internal inconsistencies 
(Document ID # 0081). The American 
Chemical Society noted that it would be 
best if OHSA identifies and updates all 
affected OSHA standards at once, 
otherwise industry may not realize all 
potential benefits (Document ID # 0165). 
The Association of Occupational Health 
Professionals in Healthcare (AOHP) 
stated: 
The standardization needs to be applied 
from the beginning until the end of the 
production, through distribution and use by 
the end user. We would recommend that any 
other OSHA standards that would be affected 
by the adoption of the HCS be changed to 
coincide with the implementation of the 
HCS’’ (Document ID # 0051) 
Of the commenters who specifically 
addressed adopting GHS provisions on 
physical hazards, many urged the 
Agency to conform the OSHA standards 
to the GHS in order to minimize 
discrepancies and ensure consistency 
(Document ID #s 0050, 0072, 0104, 
0105, 0018, 0012, 0144, 0139 and 0140). 
One commenter, 3M, noted that 
adoption of the GHS physical hazard 
criteria (without changing OSHA 
standards) would ‘‘create unacceptable 
inconsistencies between OSHA 
standards’’ (Document ID # 0128). 
However, several of the commenters 
pointed out some of the difficulties with 
adoption of the GHS physical hazards 
criteria (Document ID #s 0077, 0031, 
0034, 0038, 0145, and 0166). MRS 
Associates stated that ‘‘flammability is 
the key physical hazard that needs to 
have consistent definition and criteria 
because it affects other standards’’ 
(Document ID # 0145). Other 
commenters agreed with MRS associates 
(Document ID #s 0072, 0105, 0179, 
0145, and 0163). Manufacturer 3M 
posited that ‘‘consistent classification 
between HCS and storage and handling 
requirements is the most critical 
potential problem’’ (Document ID # 
0128). However, some commenters 
recommended OSHA limit changes in 
order to facilitate GHS implementation. 
(Document ID #s 0047, 0064, 0077, 
0104, and 0115). Dow Chemical wrote: 
Dow believes that OSHA should 
implement only those changes needed to 
facilitate GHS implementation. While this 
may necessitate some duplicative 
information on SDSs (for example, listing 
both GHS and NFPA flammability 
classifications), this would cause less 
disruption and confusion than trying to make 
changes i[n] associated standards that might 
then be in conflict with other current 
standards outside OSHA’s control (for 
example, State and local building and fire 
codes) (Document ID # 0047). 
OSHA’s proposal reflects the 
advantages of harmonizing, but takes 
into account the places where 
harmonization might be too difficult at 
this time because it would substantially 
change the scope of coverage of a 
current standard or make OSHA’s 
standards incompatible with other 
widely accepted standards. 
OSHA reviewed all its standards and 
has proposed changes to ensure that 
they are internally harmonized to 
facilitate safety and health for the 
employer and employee. To that end, 
OSHA is proposing to apply the GHS 
elements it is adopting in the modified 
HCS to its other standards. Provisions in 
OSHA standards, such as the substance- 
specific standards that set forth hazard 
and precautionary statements will be 
changed to be consistent with GHS 
terminology. Also, OSHA is proposing 
to modify provisions of the standards 
that reference the HCS definitions to 
maintain coverage or consistency with 
the modified HCS, and to change 
provisions in standards that affect the 
information requirements of the safety 
data sheet (SDS). OSHA will also 
maintain the current HCS definitions in 
the several standards that reference the 
HCS for which the adoption of GHS 
definitions could potentially impact the 
scope of those standards. 
Some standards are not being 
included in this rulemaking. As 
explained in more detail below, OSHA 
is not proposing at this time to change

certain standards that reference 
consensus standards such as National 
Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 
standards. In addition, OSHA is not 
proposing any changes in 29 CFR 
1910.109 Explosives and Blasting 
Agents and 29 CFR 1926.914 definitions 
for Blasting in Excavation Work Under 
Compressed Air. 
Substance Specific Health Standards 
OSHA proposes to update substance- 
specific health standards in General 
Industry, Construction, and Maritime, 
whether they specifically reference HCS 
or contain their own hazard 
communication requirements. OSHA is 
proposing to modify these standards in 
the following areas: 
• Revise the provisions covering 
workplace signs to require warning 
statements that are consistent with the 
GHS modifications to HCS; 
• Revise all standards to reference the 
modified HCS for labels, safety data 
sheets, and training, and identify the 
hazards that need to be addressed; 
• Maintain the requirement to avoid 
creating dust currently in some 
substance-specific health standards, but 
for which GHS modifications contain no 
equivalent statements at this time; 
• Maintain or specify language for 
contaminated clothing and debris; 
• Update most definitions in 
§ 1910.1450, Occupational Exposure to 
Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories, to 
maintain compatibility with the 
modified HCS; and 
• Change the name Material Safety 
Data Sheets to Safety Data Sheets and 
require information on them to be 
compliant with GHS in content, format 
and order. 
OSHA is proposing to update the 
language for workplace signs and labels 
to incorporate the GHS hazard statement 
and the applicable precautionary 
statement(s), where required. Most 
OSHA substance-specific health 
standards require hazard warning signs, 
usually for regulated areas, and the 
language required on the signs varies 
greatly (e.g., Asbestos, 4-Nitrobiphenyl, 
13 Carcinogens, Vinyl Chloride, 
Inorganic Arsenic, Cadmium, Benzene, 
Coke Oven Emissions, Cotton Dust, 
DBCP, Acrylonitrile, Formaldehyde, 
Methylenedianiline, 1,3-Butadiene, 
Methylene Chloride, and Lead). With 
the GHS revision, these standards retain 
the requirements for specific warning 
language for specific signs; however, 
OSHA is proposing to modify the 
language to be compatible with GHS 
and consistent throughout the OSHA 
standards. 
OSHA believes that having signs and 
labels in the same formats and 
containing identical warnings for the 
same health effects will make it far 
easier for employers and employees to 
quickly recognize the hazard and the 
degree of danger of a hazard, thus 
enhancing communication. For 
example, many of the substance-specific 
health standards were regulated as 
carcinogens; however, the hazard 
statements required on signs and labels 
range from ‘‘Cancer Hazard’’ in 
Inorganic Arsenic (29 CFR 1910.1018) to 
‘‘Cancer—Suspect agent’’ in Vinyl 
Chloride (29 CFR 1910.1017) to ‘‘May 
Cause Cancer’’ in Methylenediamiline 
(MDA) (29 CFR 1910.1050). The GHS 
revision to HCS will standardize the 
warning language to ‘‘May Cause 
Cancer’’ for each standard regulated as 
a carcinogen. NAHB addressed this 
issue, positing that the different signal 
words (‘‘Danger’’ versus ‘‘Warning’’) and 
different hazard statements (‘‘May cause 
cancer’’ versus ‘‘Suspected of causing 
cancer’’) may create confusion 
(Document ID # 0065). OSHA believes 
that the signal words and hazard 
statements in its substance-specific 
standards would be more consistent if 
they are changed to reflect the GHS 
modification to HCS. 
Currently, OSHA standards appear to 
suggest gradations of cancer hazards 
with ‘‘cancer hazard’’ seeming to signal 
the greatest hazard. However, there is no 
gradation of hazard. The standards were 
promulgated at different times and 
reflect the language used at the time and 
not relative degrees of hazard. With 
GHS harmonization, the potential 
misperception of degree of carcinogenic 
hazard is alleviated and the process is 
simplified with one statement warning 
that the chemical is carcinogenic. ‘‘May 
Cause Cancer’’ means ‘‘carcinogen,’’ is 
equivalent to any of the warnings for the 
current standards, and communicates 
the serious adverse health effects caused 
by carcinogens. Nevertheless, NAHB’s 
concerns with potential confusion over 
hazard statements and signal words are 
well taken. This highlights the need for 
training. OSHA believes that after 
hazard communication training ‘‘May 
Cause Cancer’’ and other GHS 
compliant warnings will be quickly 
recognized and easily understood, 
leading to more effective avoidance of 
the various hazards to which workers 
are exposed. See Table XV–1 for a 
comparison of the language on current 
signs to signs modified to be consistent 
with the modified HCS.

BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
OSHA’s proposal would result in all 
the substance-specific health standards 
making reference to the HCS and would 
remove the specific language that must 
be included on a label for raw materials, 
mixtures, and products. Currently, 
OSHA substance-specific standards are 
inconsistent in that some have their 
own hazard communication 
requirements while others reference the 
HCS and still others are silent, but still 
are covered by HCS. The new paragraph 
that will reference the modified HCS in 
each substance specific standard states: 
( ) Hazard communication. The employer 
shall include (insert name of chemical) in the 
workplace hazard communication program 
established to comply with the Hazard 
Communication Standard (HCS) (29 CFR 
1910.1200). The employer shall ensure that 
each employee has access to labels on 
containers of (insert name of chemical) and 
safety data sheets, and is trained in 
accordance with the provisions of HCS and 
paragraph () of this section. The employer 
shall provide information on at least the 
following hazards: (insert hazards) 
Requiring standards to reference HCS 
will ensure consistency with the GHS 
revisions and consistency among the 
standards, and consistency when the 
specific chemical is part of a mixture. 
Removal of the current specific warning 
language is essential for adoption of the 
GHS language. To leave these provisions

in the standards would result in the 
untenable situation of two potentially 
conflicting requirements, only one of 
which (the reference to HCS) would be 
in accord with the GHS modifications. 
Moreover, the hazard statements 
specified for the chemical in the 
standard may no longer be correct when 
the chemical is part of the mixture. As 
for the standards that now simply 
reference HCS, labeling will no longer 
be performance-oriented where 
producers and employers could choose 
any language and format that conveyed 
the necessary information. The GHS 
revision to HCS requires specific GHS 
elements, including pictograms, hazard 
and precautionary statements and signal 
words on labels. 
OSHA recognizes that employers have 
relied upon the warning language for 
labels in the substance-specific 
standards and that the absence of 
language where it had been in the 
standard could cause some initial 
confusion as to what, if anything, is 
required. Therefore, OSHA is proposing 
to provide guidance on the potential 
health outcomes that must be reviewed 
when classifying a substance. The 
Agency is not attempting to formally 
classify each substance; rather, OSHA is 
proposing to provide a list of health 
effects that will assist the classifier in 
determining what must be considered 
for inclusion on the new labels. The 
GHS classification process for a specific 
substance as proposed in this revision of 
the HCS will dictate the hazard 
warnings and the precautionary 
statements that will be required on the 
new GHS-compliant labels. In 
determining which hazards to include 
in the substance specific standards, the 
Agency’s primary sources on health 
effects were its own information gained 
in rulemaking and subsequent 
experience, the NIOSH Pocket Guide to 
Chemical Hazards (2005), and the 
International Chemical Safety Cards 
(ICSC), which are an undertaking of the 
International Programme on Chemical 
Safety (a joint activity of three 
cooperating International Organizations: 
namely the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), the International 
Labor Office (ILO) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO)), and which are 
peer reviewed by a group of 
internationally recognized experts. As a 
secondary source, OSHA also 
considered the European Union’s (EU) 
‘‘Proposal for a Regulation of the 
European Parliament and of the Council 
on classification, labelling and 
packaging of substances and mixtures, 
and amending Directive 67/548/EEC 
and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006’’. 
From these sources, OSHA developed 
hazard endpoints that were to be 
included in the substance-specific 
health standards based on two criteria: 
(1) the health hazard was the basis for 
the original rulemaking; or (2) the health 
hazard was asserted by OSHA, NIOSH 
or ICSC, and confirmed by a second 
source. For example, acrylonitrile (AN) 
1910.1045 was regulated based on its 
carcinogenicity. Skin sensitization was 
acknowledged by OSHA, ICSC, and EU; 
skin irritation by OSHA, NIOSH, and 
EU; respiratory tract irritation by ICSC 
and EU; eye irritation by OSHA, NIOSH, 
and ICSC; liver effects and central 
nervous system effects by ICSC and 
NIOSH; acute toxicity by OSHA, ICSC, 
and EU; and flammability by ICSC, 
NIOSH and EU. Because all these effects 
met the criteria for inclusion, skin 
irritation, respiratory irritation, eye 
irritation, liver effects, central nervous 
system effects, acute toxicity, and 
flammability were added as potential 
hazards to AN. See Table XV–2 for the 
proposed list of health effects for each 
substance-specific health standard. 
OSHA is proposing to maintain 
specific language for labels in its 
substance-specific health standards for 
containers of contaminated clothing or 
waste and debris even though these 
labels may not be consistent with the 
GHS. This is to ensure that protection 
gained from communicating these 
hazards to the downstream recipients of 
the materials is not lessened. Substances 
found on contaminated clothing and 
waste and debris often occur in 
unknown and frequently small 
quantities. In order to ensure and 
maintain protection for employees in 
the receiving workplaces, labeling of 
these hazards is essential.

meters. 
must be maintained even though there 
is no GHS equivalent. At this time, a 
work group formed under the UN 
Subcommittee of Experts for the GHS is 
working to finalize issues related to 
hazard and precautionary statements. 
As indicated in Section II of this 
preamble, this work is likely to be 
accomplished prior to the promulgation 
of the Hazard Communication final 
standard (See UN/SCEGHS/15/INF.26). 
If the UN subcommittee adopts a 
precautionary statement for creating 
dust, the paragraphs in the substance- 
specific standards can be removed and 
protection will be attained by the GHS 
modifications to HCS. However, if this 
does not occur, OSHA intends to 
continue to require them in the 
standards. 
OSHA’s Cadmium Standard provides 
an example of this issue. In paragraphs 
1910.1027(m)(3)(i) and (ii), containers 
must be labeled in accordance with HCS 
and the label must include the phrase 
‘‘Avoid Creating Dust.’’ In this case, 
there is no equivalent statement in GHS. 
Therefore, OSHA would continue to 
require this statement on labels. That 
said, OSHA believes inclusion in GHS 
would be the best way to require this 
information and if the UN subcommittee 
has completed its work in time, the 
statements could be removed from the 
standards, and the GHS modification to 
HCS would be relied upon to require the 
warning. 
OSHA is proposing to modify most 
definitions in § 1910.1450, Occupational 
Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in 
Laboratories (the laboratory standard), 
in order to maintain compatibility with 
HCS. This is consistent with the goal of 
this rulemaking and the original intent 
of the laboratory standard. OSHA 
explained in the preamble to the 
laboratory standard the importance of 
having the HCS and the laboratory 
standard both use the same definitions 
for hazardous chemicals. 
The term ‘‘hazardous chemical’’ used in 
this final rule relies on the definition of 
‘‘health hazard’’ found in the OSHA Hazard 
Communication Standard. As discussed in 
the scope and application section above, 
commenters urged OSHA to maintain 
consistency in terms between the Hazard 
Communication Standard and this final 
standard since laboratories are subject to both 
regulations. (55 FR 3315 Jan. 31, 1990) 
There is one exception in the 
laboratory standard and that is the 
definition of ‘‘select carcinogens.’’ 
(§ 1910.1450(b)). In this rulemaking, 
OSHA is proposing to maintain the 
current definition of ‘‘select 
carcinogens’’ in the laboratory standard 
since the original purpose of the 
standard was to deviate from the HCS 
definition and narrow the scope of the 
standard. As noted in the preamble, the 
scope was set for ‘‘select carcinogens’’ 
based on the small, often minute, 
quantities of substances handled. OSHA 
stated its reasons for this deviation in 
the preamble to the final rule and those 
reasons remain persuasive 
This final rule, however, modifies the 
carcinogen definition and the obligatory 
action so that special provisions must be 
explicitly considered by the employer, but 
need only be implemented when the 
employer deems them appropriate on the 
basis of the specific conditions existing in 
his/her laboratory. Moreover, the term, 
‘‘carcinogen’’ has been replaced by ‘‘select 
carcinogen’’ which covers a narrower range 
of substances * * * (55 FR 3315 Jan. 31, 
1990) 
OSHA is also proposing to change the 
name of the ‘‘material safety data 
sheets’’ for the substance specific 
standards to ‘‘safety data sheets.’’ As 
discussed above, this change is being 
proposed to reflect the GHS 
terminology. 
Safety Standards 
OSHA is proposing to modify safety 
standards that either directly reference 
the HCS or provide information 
pertinent to the Safety Data Sheets 
(SDSs), in particular regarding the 
storage and handling of chemicals. As 
noted above, some commenters 
supported standardizing physical 
hazard criteria across all applicable 
OSHA standards (Document ID #s 0104, 
0105, 0034, 0155, 0170, and 0171). 
However, some other commenters, and 
even some who supported applying 
physical hazard criteria across all 
standards, raised concerns about storage 
and handling requirements; degree of 
impact; potential effects on the scope of 
the Process Safety Management (PSM) 
Standard; and potential conflicts with 
widely accepted consensus standards 
(Document ID #s 0104, 0038, 0077, and 
0163). OSHA is addressing all of these 
concerns in this proposal. OSHA’s 
proposed integration of the physical 
hazards criteria would: 
• Incorporate the current HCS 
definitions of flammable liquid and gas 
into PSM and health hazard into 
Hazardous Waste Operations and 
Emergency Response (HAZWOPER); 
• Change paragraphs on flammable 
and combustible liquids to conform in 
categories, terminology, flashpoints (FP) 
and boiling points (BP) to the GHS 
modifications to HCS; 
• Update the acceptable methods for 
determining flashpoints; 
• Modify the welding standard 
§ 1910.252 requirements on labeling 
welding consumables to be consistent 
with GHS modifications to HCS; and 
• Incorporate the modified-HCS 
definition of flammable aerosols into the 
Flammable and Combustible Liquids 
Standard § 1910.106 35; but 
• Leave unchanged electrical 
standards in Subpart S for general 
industry and Subpart K for construction, 
and explosive standards § 1910.109 for 
general industry and § 1926.914 for 
construction. 
OSHA agrees with the commenters 
who urged the Agency to ensure 
consistency in its standards while 
maintaining their scope (Document ID 
#s 0049, 0050, 0077, 0105, 0123, 0145, 
0163, and 0170). Two standards, PSM 
and HAZWOPER, rely on definitions 
from the HCS to define their scope. If 
OSHA did not modify these standards 
during this rulemaking, there would be 
unintended coverage changes. For 
example, PSM covers processes that 
involve ‘‘flammable liquids’’ as 
currently defined by reference to the 
HCS which are limited to liquids with 
a flashpoint below 100 °F. However, the 
proposal incorporates the GHS 
definitions for physical hazards and 
defines flammable liquids as liquids 
with a flashpoint below 199.4 °F, 
potentially increasing the coverage of 
PSM by adding flammable liquids with 
flashpoints between 100 °F and 199.4 °F 
to the chemicals PSM already covers. 
Therefore, OSHA is proposing to change 
the PSM standard to define ‘‘flammable 
liquid’’ by the specific flashpoint set 
forth in the current HCS, rather than 
referencing HCS’s definition of 
flammable liquid. Similarly for 
‘‘flammable gas,’’ OSHA is proposing to 
change the definition to only include 
Category 1 flammable gas to maintain 
coverage of PSM. Therefore, OSHA 
would delete the reference to HCS for 
flammable liquid and insert the current 
definition in paragraph 
1910.119(a)(1)(ii). The current PSM 
standard states: 
(ii) A process which involves a flammable 
liquid or gas (as defined in 1910.1200(c) of 
this part) on site in one location, in a 
quantity of 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) * * * 
The new proposed paragraph would 
state: 
(ii) A process which involves a Category 1 
flammable gas (as defined in 1910.1200 (c)) 
or flammable liquid with a flashpoint below 
100 °F (37.8 °C) on site in one location, in 
a quantity of 10,000 pounds (4535.9 kg) 
* * *

Likewise, OSHA is proposing to 
update the definition of health hazard in 
HAZWOPER 1910.120 so the 
terminology is aligned with the GHS 
health hazards in Appendix A. The new 
definition would read: 
Health hazard means a chemical or a 
pathogen where acute or chronic health 
effects may occur in exposed employees. It 
also includes stress due to temperature 
extremes. The term ‘‘health hazard’’ includes 
chemicals which are classified in accordance 
with the Hazard Communication standard, 29 
CFR 1910.1200 as posing one of the following 
hazardous effects: Acute toxicity (any route 
of exposure); skin corrosion or irritation; 
serious eye damage or eye irritation; 
respiratory or skin sensitization; germ cell 
mutagenicity; carcinogenicity; reproductive 
toxicity; target organ specific systemic 
toxicity (single or repeated dose); or 
aspiration toxicity. The criteria for 
determining whether a chemical is classified 
as a health hazard can be found in Appendix 
A to 29 CFR 1910.1200. 
OSHA was concerned that some of the 
terminology in HAZWOPER, such as 
neurotoxin and nephrotoxin (see 
definitions in ‘‘health hazard’’) which 
are partly defined by reference to the 
HCS would no longer be consistent with 
the modified HCS. OSHA has not 
dropped these health hazards, but 
instead, consistent with the GHS 
modifications to HCS, such terms are 
recatagorized under specific target organ 
toxicity, thus maintaining the same 
requirements for hazard 
communication. If OSHA did not 
update the definition in HAZWOPER 
then employers would not have the 
proper guidance on how to classify a 
health hazard consistent with the GHS. 
Flammable and Combustible Liquids 
OSHA is proposing to align the 
definitions of flammable and 
combustible liquids to conform to the 
GHS modifications to HCS in categories, 
terminology, flashpoints, and boiling 
points, in the general industry, 
construction, and maritime standards. 
(See Table XV–3 for comparison of the 
current HCS definitions and the GHS 
flammable liquid definitions.) OSHA 
believes that most of the changes in the 
definitions are not significant. OSHA is 
proposing to make nominal changes to 
the flashpoint values for flammable and 
combustible liquids from 22.8 ° C to 23 
°C and 93.3 °C to 93 °C to be consistent 
with the GHS modifications to HCS. 
OSHA believes these changes represent 
simple rounding to the closest 
significant value and that they will have 
no effect on the scope of its standards 
or safety, but will enable users to work 
in whole numbers, which OSHA 
believes will benefit affected employers 
and employees. 
However, other changes are 
potentially significant. The boiling 
points used to define the threshold for 
the current Flammable Class IA will 
shift from the cut-point of 37.8 °C to a 
cut-point of 35 °C for Category 1 in the 
modified HCS. Flammable Class IA is 
currently defined as any liquid with a 
FP of greater than (>) 22.8 °C and a BP 
of less than (<) 37.8 °C; the new 
definition will adopt a BP of less than 
or equal to (≤) 35 ° C. Likewise, the BP 
will shift for the current definition of 
Flammable Class IB from equal to or 
greater than (≥) 37.8 °C to (>) 35 °C for 
Category 2. These changes are necessary 
to make OSHA standards internally 
consistent and consistent with the GHS 
modifications to HCS. However, OSHA 
is concerned that changing the boiling 
point cut-off for the highly flammable 
liquids currently classified as 
Flammable IA could, under the GHS 
modifications to HCS, lead to a subset 
of these chemicals being classified as 
GHS Category 2 Flammable Liquids. 
Since some of the storage and handling 
requirements are based on the hazard 
category, a facility could increase the 
size of its storage tanks for the liquids 
with boiling points between 37.8 °C and 
35 °C. It is possible that increasing the 
size for these chemicals could decrease 
the safety of their storage. OSHA has 
reviewed the properties related to the 
flammability of approximately 900 
chemical substances (754 liquids) listed 
in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and 
Physics [85th edition]. Approximately 1 
percent of this list of flammable liquids 
would result in a reclassification from 
the current Flammable and Combustible 
Liquids Standard Class IA to GHS 
Category 2. While this is a small 
percentage of the total flammable 
liquids, it represents approximately 15 
percent of the current Flammable and 
Combustible Liquids Standard Class IA 
liquids on this list. This is an instance 
where the benefits of harmonization 
could be in conflict with the measure of 
safety currently provided. 
How the storage and handling of 
chemicals would be affected by the 
changes in classification of chemicals 
generated significant comments to the 
ANPR. Some commenters urged the 
Agency to change criteria in the 
standards, but acknowledged that the 
storage and handling requirements for 
flammable liquids would present the 
most critical potential problems 
(Document ID #s 0072, 0102, 0179, 
0034, 0145, and 0163). Other 
commenters were concerned that 
changing the definitions, including 
flammability criteria, would require 
facilities to modify their storage 
facilities to maintain compliance with 
§ 1910.106, with some worried that 
storage receptacles would have to be 
smaller, leading to less storage and 
greater costs. For example, BASF wrote: 
The flammable and combustible liquid 
standard, 29 CFR 1910.106, includes 
definitions within the standard. Changing 
these to be consistent with the GHS 
definitions could require storage facilities to 
be modified or the amount of storage 
inventory limited, all of which impacts the 
cost of implementation. (Document ID # 
0119) 
OSHA disagrees with this statement. 
Because the GHS change from OSHA’s 
flammable and combustible classes to 
GHS Categories involves a lowering of 
the boiling point cut-offs by 2.8 °C, all 
current handling and storage would be 
permitted. In addition, storage and 
handling of chemicals whose boiling 
points fall between 37.8 °C and 35 °C 
would be allowed to be stored according 
to the lesser flammability Category 2. 
Category 2 chemicals could be stored in 
larger containers but, as noted above, it 
is possible that safety could be 
compromised. OSHA is proposing the 
GHS changes to the safety standards 
because it believes safety will be 
enhanced by the standardization of the 
GHS modifications. However, OSHA is 
seeking comment on the resulting 
handling and storage of chemicals after 
the standards have incorporated GHS 
definitions, and the Agency has 
included this topic in Section II (Issues) 
of this preamble.

OSHA is also proposing to adopt the 
terminology in the GHS modifications to 
HCS so that all liquids covered by 
§ 1910.106 will be redefined as 
flammable liquids in Categories 1–4, as 
appropriate, and the term ‘‘Combustible 
Liquids’’ in §§ 1910.106, 1910.107, 
1910.123, 1910.125, 1926.152, and 
1926.155 will be deleted. Instead of 
using the term Combustible Class IIIB, 
flammable liquids with a flashpoint of 
≥ 93 °C will be called ‘‘Flammable 
Liquids with a Flashpoint of > 93 °C.’’ 
The GHS does not classify flammable 
liquids with flashpoints > 93 °C and, in 
fact, does not use the term combustible 
liquid for classification. However, other 
OSHA standards, such as § 1910.107, 
Spray Finishing Using Flammable and 
Combustible Materials, relying on the 
current § 1910.106 definitions of 
flammable and combustible liquids, 
which cover liquids with a flashpoint 
over 93 °C as ‘‘combustible liquids.’’ 
OSHA believes it needs to maintain this 
non-GHS category in order to preserve 
the coverage of combustibles in 
standards such as Spray Finishing. 
However, these chemicals will be 
known by the new term ‘‘Flammable 
Liquids with a Flashpoint of Greater 
Than 93°C,’’ which means that 
protection provided by the current 
standards remains in force. 
Updating the Method To Determine 
Flashpoint 
Currently, OSHA references only 
ASTM D–56–70 or ASTM D–93–71 for 
testing methods to determine 
flashpoints for liquids and these are the 
only methods allowed. However, these 
methods, which were developed in 1970 
and 1971, have been updated and are 
incompatible with GHS. To remedy this 
situation, OSHA is proposing to 
reference the methods set forth in the 
GHS that can be used to determine 
flashpoints. These methods include 
updated ASTM methods, ISO methods, 
as well as British, French, and German 
national standards for the testing. A 
complete list of methods is in the 
Globally Harmonized System of 
Classification and Labelling of 
Chemicals (GHS) (second revision, 
2007). OSHA is seeking comment on 
this approach, and the Agency has 
included this topic in Section II (Issues) 
of this preamble. 
Welding, Cutting and Brazing 
OSHA is proposing to modify the 
labeling requirements for welding 
consumables in the Welding, Cutting 
and Brazing Standard, paragraphs 
1910.252(c)(iv)(A), (B), and (C). These 
paragraphs contain the labeling 
requirements for filler metals, fusible 
granular materials and fluxes. The 
standard sets forth the responsibility for 
labeling in paragraph 1910.252(c)(iv): 
The suppliers of welding materials 
shall determine the hazard, if any 
associated with the use of their 
materials in welding, cutting, etc. 
Similar to the substance-specific health 
standards, OSHA is proposing to require 
these labels to be consistent with the 
GHS modifications to HCS. 
Flammable Aerosols 
OSHA is proposing to harmonize its 
existing standards with the GHS 
modifications to HCS on flammable 
aerosols. Currently OSHA references 
CPSC regulations for its definition of 
flammable aerosol. The current HCS 
definition is: 
‘‘Aerosol, flammable’’ means an aerosol 
that, when tested by the method described in 
16 CFR 1500.45, yields a flame projection 
exceeding 18 inches at full valve opening, or 
a flashback (a flame extending back to the 
valve) at any degree of valve opening. 
OSHA defines and regulates flammable 
aerosols in its Flammable and 
Combustible Liquids standard at 29 CFR 
1910.106. The definitions there are: 
Aerosol shall mean a material which is 
dispensed from its container as a mist, spray, 
or foam by a propellant under pressure. 
§ 1910.106(a)(1). 
Flammable aerosol shall mean an aerosol 
which is required to be labeled ‘‘Flammable’’ 
under the Federal Hazardous Substances 
Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1261). For the 
purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, 
such aerosols are considered Class IA liquids. 
§ 1910.106(a)(13). 
Appendix B.3 of GHS modifications to 
HCS begins its definition with what an 
aerosol is: 
* * * any non-refillable receptacle 
containing a gas compressed, liquefied or 
dissolved under pressure, and fitted with a 
release device allowing the contents to be 
ejected as particles in suspension in a gas, or 
as a foam, paste, powder, liquid or gas. 
(Appendix B) 
Aerosols are then further classified into 
one of two categories if it contains a 
flammable liquid, gas or solid 
(Appendix B.3.2.1). 
OSHA’s decision to change the 
definition of aerosols to be consistent 
with the GHS is based not only upon 
harmonizing its own standards with 
those followed by other countries who 
have or are considering adopting GHS, 
but also with making OSHA standards 
internally consistent. OSHA believes 
that the classification resulting from the 
various methods are similar enough that

all aerosols currently regulated by 
OSHA would continue to be so and that 
few, if any, new aerosols would be 
subject to OSHA regulation. Thus, 
OSHA is proposing to remove the 
current definitions from its Flammable 
and Combustible Liquids standards and 
insert its GHS consistent definitions 
along with references to Appendix B.3 
of the HCS. While the Agency believes 
the effect of these changes will be 
minimal, it nevertheless seeks comment 
on this change which will primarily 
affect the Flammable and Combustible 
Liquids standards. 
Standards Not Included in This 
Rulemaking 
At this time, OSHA is not proposing 
to change standards that incorporate by 
reference other consensus standards, 
such as NFPA codes, or are based on 
consensus standards when those 
consensus standards are used for 
internal design criteria only and do not 
reference HCS for applicable scope or 
incorporation into the SDS. These 
standards would include subpart S— 
Electrical in part 1910 (General 
industry) and Subpart K—Electrical in 
part 1926 (Construction). Many 
commenters were particularly 
concerned that a change in OSHA’s 
definitions would create an 
incompatibility with local building 
codes (Document ID #s 0047, 0075, 
0076, 0104, 0113, 0145 and 0163). In 
many cases, this would require 
extensive rewiring to meet the subpart 
S requirements on hazardous locations 
and would lead to conflicts with local 
electrical codes. 
In addition OSHA is not proposing to 
update standards that pertain to 
explosives at this time. A separate 
rulemaking to revise the Explosive and 
Blasting Agents standard § 1910.109 is 
currently in progress.

§ 1910.1200 Hazard communication. 
(a) Purpose. 
(1) The purpose of this section is to 
ensure that the hazards of all chemicals 
produced or imported are classified, and 
that information concerning the 
classified hazards is transmitted to 
employers and employees. The 
requirements of this section are 
intended to be consistent with the 
provisions of the United Nations 
Globally Harmonized System of 
Classification and Labeling of Chemicals 
(GHS), Revision 3. The transmittal of 
information is to be accomplished by 
means of comprehensive hazard 
communication programs, which are to 
include container labeling and other 
forms of warning, safety data sheets and 
employee training. 
* * * * * 
(2) This occupational safety and 
health standard is intended to address 
comprehensively the issue of classifying 
the potential hazards of chemicals, and 
communicating information concerning 
hazards and appropriate protective 
measures to employees, and to preempt 
any legal requirements of a state, or 
political subdivision of a state, 
pertaining to this subject. Classifying 
the potential hazards of chemicals and 
communicating information concerning 
hazards and appropriate protective 
measures to employees, may include, 
for example, but is not limited to, 
provisions for: developing and 
maintaining a written hazard 
communication program for the 
workplace, including lists of hazardous 
chemicals present; labeling of 
containers of chemicals in the 
workplace, as well as of containers of 
chemicals being shipped to other 
workplaces; preparation and 
distribution of safety data sheets to 
employees and downstream employers; 
and development and implementation 
of employee training programs regarding 
hazards of chemicals and protective 
measures. Under section 18 of the Act, 
no state or political subdivision of a 
state may adopt or enforce, through any 
court or agency, any requirement 
relating to the issue addressed by this 
Federal standard, except pursuant to a 
Federally-approved state plan. 
(b) * * * 
(1) This section requires chemical 
manufacturers or importers to classify 
the hazards of chemicals which they 
produce or import, and all employers to 
provide information to their employees 
about the hazardous chemicals to which 
they are exposed, by means of a hazard 
communication program, labels and 
other forms of warning, safety data 
sheets, and information and training. In 
addition, this section requires 
distributors to transmit the required 
information to employers. (Employers 
who do not produce or import 
chemicals need only focus on those 
parts of this rule that deal with 
establishing a workplace program and 
communicating information to their 
workers.)

Chemical name means the scientific 
designation of a chemical in accordance 
with the nomenclature system 
developed by the International Union of 
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) or 
the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) 
rules of nomenclature, or a name that 
will clearly identify the chemical for the 
purpose of conducting a hazard 
classification. 
Classification means to identify the 
relevant data regarding the hazards of a 
chemical; review those data to ascertain 
the hazards associated with the 
chemical; and decide whether the 
chemical will be classified as 
hazardous, and the degree of hazard 
where appropriate, by comparing the 
data with the criteria for health and 
physical hazards. 
Hazard category means the division of 
criteria within each hazard class, e.g., 
oral acute toxicity and flammable 
liquids include 4 hazard categories. 
These categories compare hazard 
severity within a hazard class and 
should not be taken as a comparison of 
hazard categories more generally. 
Hazard class means the nature of the 
physical or health hazards, e.g., 
flammable solid, carcinogen, oral acute 
toxicity. 
Hazard statement means a statement 
assigned to a hazard class and category 
that describes the nature of the hazard(s) 
of a chemical, including, where 
appropriate, the degree of hazard. 
Hazardous chemical means any 
chemical which is classified as a 
physical hazard or a health hazard, or 
an unclassified hazard as defined in this 
section. 
* * * * * 
Health hazard means a chemical that 
is classified as posing one of the 
following hazardous effects: acute 
toxicity (any route of exposure); skin 
corrosion or irritation; serious eye 
damage or eye irritation; respiratory or 
skin sensitization; germ cell 
mutagenicity; carcinogenicity; 
reproductive toxicity; specific target 
organ toxicity (single or repeated 
exposure); or aspiration hazard. The 
criteria for determining whether a 
chemical is classified as a health hazard 
are detailed in Appendix A to 
§ 1910.1200—Health Hazard Criteria. 
* * * * * 
Label means an appropriate group of 
written, printed or graphic information 
elements concerning a hazardous 
chemical, that is affixed to, printed on, 
or attached to the immediate container 
of a hazardous chemical, or to the 
outside packaging. 
Label elements means the specified 
pictogram, hazard statement, signal 
word and precautionary statement for 
each hazard class and category. 
Mixture means a combination or a 
solution composed of two or more 
substances in which they do not react. 
Physical hazard means a chemical 
that is classified as posing one of the 
following hazardous effects: explosive; 
flammable (gases, aerosols, liquids, or 
solids); oxidizer (liquid, solid or gas); 
self-reactive; pyrophoric (liquid or 
solid); self-heating; organic peroxide; 
corrosive to metal; gas under pressure; 
or in contact with water emits 
flammable gas. See Appendix B to 
§ 1910.1200—Physical Hazard Criteria. 
Pictogram means a composition that 
may include a symbol plus other 
graphic elements, such as a border, 
background pattern, or color, that is 
intended to convey specific information 
about the hazards of a chemical. Eight 
pictograms are designated under this 
standard for application to a hazard 
category. 
Precautionary statement means a 
phrase that describes recommended 
measures that should be taken to 
minimize or prevent adverse effects 
resulting from exposure to a hazardous 
chemical, or improper storage or 
handling. 
* * * * * 
Product identifier means the name or 
number used for a hazardous chemical 
on a label or in the SDS. It provides a 
unique means by which the user can 
identify the chemical. The product 
identifier used shall permit cross- 
references to be made among the 
required list of hazardous chemicals, the 
label and the SDS. 
* * * * * 
Safety data sheet (SDS) means written 
or printed material concerning a 
hazardous chemical that is prepared in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this 
section. 
Signal word means a word used to 
indicate the relative level of severity of 
hazard and alert the reader to a potential 
hazard on the label. The signal words 
used in this section are ‘‘danger’’ and 
‘‘warning.’’ ‘‘Danger’’ is used for the 
more severe hazards, while ‘‘warning’’ 
is used for the less severe. 
* * * * * 
Substance means chemical elements 
and their compounds in the natural 
state or obtained by any production 
process, including any additive 
necessary to preserve the stability of the 
product and any impurities deriving 
from the process used, but excluding 
any solvent which may be separated 
without affecting the stability of the 
substance or changing its composition. 
Trade secret means any confidential 
formula, pattern, process, device, 
information or compilation of 
information that is used in an 
employer’s business, and that gives the 
employer an opportunity to obtain an 
advantage over competitors who do not 
know or use it. Appendix E to 
§ 1910.1200—Definition of Trade Secret, 
sets out the criteria to be used in 
evaluating trade secrets. 
Unclassified hazard means a chemical 
for which there is scientific evidence 
identified during the classification 
process that it may pose an adverse 
physical or health effect when present 
in a workplace under normal conditions 
of use or in a foreseeable emergency, but 
the evidence does not currently meet 
the specified criteria for physical or 
health hazard classification in this 
section. This does not include adverse 
physical and health effects for which 
there is a hazard class addressed in this 
section. 
* * * * * 
(d) Hazard classification. 
(1) Chemical manufacturers and 
importers shall evaluate chemicals 
produced in their workplaces or 
imported by them to classify their 
health and physical hazards in 
accordance with this section. For each 
chemical, the chemical manufacturer or 
importer shall determine the hazard 
classes, and the category of each class 
that apply to the chemical being 
classified. Employers are not required to 
classify chemicals unless they choose 
not to rely on the classification 
performed by the chemical 
manufacturer or importer for the 
chemical to satisfy this requirement. 
(2) Chemical manufacturers, 
importers or employers classifying 
chemicals shall identify and consider 
the full range of available scientific 
literature and other evidence concerning 
the potential hazards. There is no 
requirement to test the chemical to 
determine how to classify its hazards. 
Appendix A to § 1910.1200 shall be 
consulted for classification of health 
hazards, and Appendix B to § 1910.1200 
shall be consulted for the classification 
of physical hazards. 
(3) Mixtures. 
(i) Chemical manufacturers, 
importers, or employers evaluating 
chemicals shall follow the procedures 
described in Appendixes A and B to 
§ 1910.1200 to classify the hazards of 
the chemicals, including determinations 
regarding when mixtures of the 
classified chemicals are covered by this 
section. 
(ii) A chemical manufacturer or 
importer of a mixture shall be

classification of the mixture even when 
relying on the classifications for 
individual ingredients received from the 
ingredient manufacturers or importers 
on the safety data sheets. 
* * * * * 
(f) Labels and other forms of warning. 
(1) Labels on shipped containers. The 
chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
distributor shall ensure that each 
container of classified hazardous 
chemicals leaving the workplace is 
labeled, tagged or marked with the 
following information: 
(i) Product identifier; 
(ii) Signal word; 
(iii) Hazard statement(s); 
(iv) Pictogram(s); 
(v) Precautionary statement(s); and, 
(vi) Name, address, and telephone 
number of the chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or other responsible party. 
(2) For unclassified hazards, the label 
shall include the name of the chemical, 
the name, address, and telephone 
number of the manufacturer, importer, 
or other responsible party, and, provide 
as supplementary information, a 
description of the unclassified hazards 
and appropriate precautionary measures 
to ensure the safe handling and use of 
the chemical. 
(3) The chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or distributor shall ensure that 
the information provided under (f)(1)(i) 
through (v) is in accordance with 
Appendix C, Allocation of Label 
Elements, for each hazard class and 
associated hazard category for the 
hazardous chemical, prominently 
displayed, and in English (other 
languages may also be included if 
appropriate). 
(4) The chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or distributor shall ensure that 
the information provided under (f)(1)(ii) 
through (iv) is located together on the 
label, tag, or mark. 
(5)(i) For solid metal (such as a steel 
beam or a metal casting), solid wood, or 
plastic items that are not exempted as 
articles due to their downstream use, or 
shipments of whole grain, the required 
label may be transmitted to the 
customer at the time of the initial 
shipment, and need not be included 
with subsequent shipments to the same 
employer unless the information on the 
label changes; 
(ii) The label may be transmitted with 
the initial shipment itself, or with the 
safety data sheet that is to be provided 
prior to or at the time of the first 
shipment; and, 
(iii) This exception to requiring labels 
on every container of hazardous 
chemicals is only for the solid material 
itself, and does not apply to hazardous 
chemicals used in conjunction with, or 
known to be present with, the material 
and to which employees handling the 
items in transit may be exposed (for 
example, cutting fluids or pesticides in 
grains). 
(6) Chemical manufacturers, 
importers, or distributors shall ensure 
that each container of hazardous 
chemicals leaving the workplace is 
labeled, tagged, or marked in 
accordance with this section in a 
manner which does not conflict with 
the requirements of the Hazardous 
Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. 
1801 et seq.) and regulations issued 
under that Act by the Department of 
Transportation. 
(7) Workplace labeling. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (f)(8) and (f)(9) 
of this section, the employer shall 
ensure that each container of hazardous 
chemicals in the workplace is labeled, 
tagged or marked with either: 
(i) The information specified under 
(f)(1)(i) through (v) for labels on shipped 
containers; or, 
(ii) Product identifier and words, 
pictures, symbols, or combination 
thereof, which provide at least general 
information regarding the hazards of the 
chemicals, and which, in conjunction 
with the other information immediately 
available to employees under the hazard 
communication program, will provide 
employees with the specific information 
regarding the physical and health 
hazards of the hazardous chemical. 
(8) The employer may use signs, 
placards, process sheets, batch tickets, 
operating procedures, or other such 
written materials in lieu of affixing 
labels to individual stationary process 
containers, as long as the alternative 
method identifies the containers to 
which it is applicable and conveys the 
information required by paragraph (f)(7) 
of this section to be on a label. The 
employer shall ensure the written 
materials are readily accessible to the 
employees in their work area 
throughout each work shift. 
(9) The employer is not required to 
label portable containers into which 
hazardous chemicals are transferred 
from labeled containers, and which are 
intended only for the immediate use of 
the employee who performs the transfer. 
For purposes of this section, drugs 
which are dispensed by a pharmacy to 
a health care provider for direct 
administration to a patient are exempted 
from labeling. 
(10) The employer shall not remove or 
deface existing labels on incoming 
containers of hazardous chemicals, 
unless the container is immediately 
marked with the required information. 
(11) The employer shall ensure that 
workplace labels or other forms of 
warning are legible, in English, and 
prominently displayed on the container, 
or readily available in the work area 
throughout each work shift. Employers 
having employees who speak other 
languages may add the information in 
their language to the material presented, 
as long as the information is presented 
in English as well. 
(12) Chemical manufacturers, 
importers, distributors, or employers 
who become newly aware of any 
significant information regarding the 
hazards of a chemical shall revise the 
labels for the chemical within three 
months of becoming aware of the new 
information, and shall ensure that labels 
on containers of hazardous chemicals 
shipped after that time contain the new 
information. If the chemical is not 
currently produced or imported, the 
chemical manufacturer, importer, 
distributor, or employer shall add the 
information to the label before the 
chemical is shipped or introduced into 
the workplace again. 
* * * * * 
(g) * * * 
(2) The chemical manufacturer or 
importer preparing the safety data sheet 
shall ensure that it is in English 
(although the employer may maintain 
copies in other languages as well), and 
includes the following section numbers 
and headings, and associated 
information under each heading, in the 
order listed (See Appendix D to 
§ 1910.1200—Safety Data Sheets, for the 
specific content of each section of the

(5) The chemical manufacturer, 
importer or employer preparing the 
safety data sheet shall ensure that the 
information provided accurately reflects 
the scientific evidence used in making 
the hazard classification. If the chemical 
manufacturer, importer or employer 
preparing the safety data sheet becomes 
newly aware of any significant 
information regarding the hazards of a 
chemical, or ways to protect against the 
hazards, this new information shall be 
added to the safety data sheet within 
three months. If the chemical is not 
currently being produced or imported 
the chemical manufacturer or importer 
shall add the information to the safety 
data sheet before the chemical is 
introduced into the workplace again. 
* * * * * 
(11) Safety data sheets shall also be 
made readily available, upon request, to

health professionals, employees, and 
designated representatives in 
accordance with the applicable 
provisions of this paragraph. 
(2) Where a treating physician or 
nurse determines that a medical 
emergency exists and the specific 
chemical identity and/or specific 
percentage of composition of a 
hazardous chemical is necessary for 
emergency or first-aid treatment, the 
chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
employer shall immediately disclose the 
specific chemical identity or percentage 
composition of a trade secret chemical 
to that treating physician or nurse, 
regardless of the existence of a written 
statement of need or a confidentiality 
agreement. The chemical manufacturer,

written statement of need and 
confidentiality agreement, in 
accordance with the provisions of 
paragraphs (i)(3) and (4) of this section, 
as soon as circumstances permit. 
(3) In non-emergency situations, a 
chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
employer shall, upon request, disclose a 
specific chemical identity or percentage 
composition, otherwise permitted to be 
withheld under paragraph (i)(1) of this 
section, to a health professional (i.e. 
physician, industrial hygienist, 
toxicologist, epidemiologist, or 
occupational health nurse) providing 
medical or other occupational health 
services to exposed employee(s), and to 
employees or designated 
representatives, if:

trade secret, or that it is a trade secret, 
but the requesting health professional, 
employee, or designated representative 
has a legitimate medical or occupational 
health need for the information, has 
executed a written confidentiality 
agreement, and has shown adequate 
means to protect the confidentiality of 
the information, the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer 
will be subject to citation by OSHA. 
(ii) If a chemical manufacturer, 
importer, or employer demonstrates to 
OSHA that the execution of a 
confidentiality agreement would not 
provide sufficient protection against the 
potential harm from the unauthorized 
disclosure of a trade secret, the 
Assistant Secretary may issue such 
orders or impose such additional 
limitations or conditions upon the 
disclosure of the requested chemical 
information as may be appropriate to 
assure that the occupational health 
services are provided without an undue 
risk of harm to the chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer.

(11) If a citation for a failure to release 
trade secret information is contested by 
the chemical manufacturer, importer, or 
employer, the matter will be adjudicated 
before the Occupational Safety and 
Health Review Commission in 
accordance with the Act’s enforcement 
scheme and the applicable Commission 
rules of procedure. In accordance with 
the Commission rules, when a chemical 
manufacturer, importer, or employer 
continues to withhold the information 
during the contest, the Administrative 
Law Judge may review the citation and 
supporting documentation ‘‘in camera’’ 
or issue appropriate orders to protect 
the confidentiality of such matters.

Appendix A to § 1910.1200—Health 
Hazard Criteria (Mandatory) 
A.0 GENERAL CLASSIFICATION 
CONSIDERATIONS 
A.0.1 Classification 
A.0.1.1 The term ‘‘hazard classification’’ 
is used to indicate that only the intrinsic 
hazardous properties of chemicals are 
considered. Hazard classification 
incorporates three steps: 
(a) identification of relevant data regarding 
the hazards of a chemical; 
(b) subsequent review of those data to 
ascertain the hazards associated with the 
chemical; 
(c) determination of whether the chemical 
will be classified as hazardous and the degree 
of hazard. 
A.0.1.2 For many hazard classes, the 
criteria are semi-quantitative or qualitative 
and expert judgment is required to interpret 
the data for classification purposes. 
A.0.2 Available Data, Test Methods and 
Test Data Quality 
A.0.2.1 There is no requirement for 
testing chemicals. 
A.0.2.2 The criteria for determining 
health hazards are test method neutral, i.e., 
they do not specify particular test methods, 
as long as the methods are scientifically 
validated procedures. 
A.0.2.3 The term ‘‘scientifically 
validated’’ refers to the process by which the 
reliability and the relevance of a procedure 
are established for a particular purpose. 
A.0.2.4 Existing test data are acceptable 
for classifying chemicals, although expert 
judgment also may be needed for 
classification purposes. 
A.0.2.5 The effect of a chemical on 
biological systems is influenced by the 
physico-chemical properties of the substance 
and/or ingredients of the mixture and the 
way in which ingredient substances are 
biologically available. A chemical need not 
be classified when it can be shown by 
conclusive experimental data from 
scientifically validated test methods that the 
chemical is not biologically available. 
A.0.2.6 For classification purposes, 
epidemiological data and experience on the 
effects of chemicals on humans (e.g., 
occupational data, data from accident 
databases) shall be taken into account in the 
evaluation of human health hazards of a 
chemical. 
A.0.3 Classification Based on Weight of 
Evidence 
A.0.3.1 For some hazard classes, 
classification results directly when the data 
satisfy the criteria. For others, classification 
of a chemical shall be determined on the 
basis of the total weight of evidence using 
expert judgment. This means that all 
available information bearing on the 
classification of hazard shall be considered 
together, including the results of valid in 
vitro tests, relevant animal data, and human 
experience such as epidemiological and 
clinical studies and well-documented case 
reports and observations. 
A.0.3.2 The quality and consistency of 
the data shall be considered. Information on 
chemicals related to the material being 
classified shall be considered as appropriate, 
as well as site of action and mechanism or 
mode of action study results. Both positive 
and negative results shall be assembled 
together in a single weight of evidence 
determination. 
A.0.3.3 Positive effects which are 
consistent with the criteria for classification, 
whether seen in humans or animals, shall 
normally justify classification. Where 
evidence is available from both humans and 
animals and there is a conflict between the 
findings, the quality and reliability of the 
evidence from both sources shall be 
evaluated in order to resolve the question of 
classification. Reliable, good quality human 
data shall generally have precedence over 
other data. However, even well-designed and 
conducted epidemiological studies may lack 
a sufficient number of subjects to detect 
relatively rare but still significant effects, or 
to assess potentially confounding factors. 
Therefore, positive results from well- 
conducted animal studies are not necessarily 
negated by the lack of positive human 
experience but require an assessment of the 
robustness, quality and statistical power of 
both the human and animal data. 
A.0.3.4 Route of exposure, mechanistic 
information, and metabolism studies are 
pertinent to determining the relevance of an 
effect in humans. When such information 
raises doubt about relevance in humans, a 
lower classification may be warranted. When 
there is scientific evidence demonstrating 
that the mechanism or mode of action is not 
relevant to humans, the chemical should not 
be classified. 
A.0.3.5 Both positive and negative results 
are assembled together in the weight of 
evidence determination. However, a single 
positive study performed according to good 
scientific principles and with statistically 
and biologically significant positive results 
may justify classification. 
A.0.4 Considerations for the Classification 
of Mixtures 
A.0.4.1 For most hazard classes, the 
recommended process of classification of 
mixtures is based on the following sequence: 
(a) Where test data are available for the 
complete mixture, the classification of the 
mixture will always be based on that data; 
(b) Where test data are not available for the 
mixture itself, the bridging principles 
designated in each health hazard chapter of 
this appendix shall be considered for 
classification of the mixture; 
For health hazards, 
(c) If test data are not available for the 
mixture itself, and the available information 
is not sufficient to allow application of the 
above-mentioned bridging principles, then 
the method(s) described in each chapter for 
estimating the hazards based on the 
information known will be applied to classify 
the mixture (e.g., application of 
concentration limits). 
A.0.4.2 An exception to the above order 
or precedence is made for Carcinogenicity, 
Germ Cell Mutagenicity, and Reproductive 
Toxicity. For these three hazard classes, 
mixtures shall be classified based upon 
information on the ingredient substances, 
unless on a case-by-case basis, justification 
can be provided for classifying based upon 
the mixture as a whole. See chapters A.5, 
A.6, and A.7 for further information on case- 
by-case bases. 
A.0.4.3 Use of Concentration Limits 
A.0.4.3.1 When classifying an untested 
mixture based on the hazards of its 
ingredients, concentration limits for the 
classified ingredients of the mixture are used 
for several hazard classes. While the adopted 
concentration limits adequately identify the 
hazard for most mixtures, there may be some 
that contain hazardous ingredients at lower 
concentrations than the specified 
concentration limits that still pose an 
identifiable hazard. There may also be cases 
where the concentration limit is considerably 
lower than could be expected on the basis of 
an established non-hazardous level for an 
ingredient. 
A.0.4.3.2 If the classifier has information 
that the hazard of an ingredient will be 
evident (i.e., it presents a health risk) below 
the specified concentration limit, the mixture 
containing that ingredient shall be classified 
accordingly. 
A.0.4.3.3 In exceptional cases, conclusive 
data may demonstrate that the hazard of an 
ingredient will not be evident (i.e., it does 
not present a health risk) when present at a 
level above the specified concentration 
limit(s). In these cases the mixture may be 
classified according to those data. The data 
must exclude the possibility that the 
ingredient will behave in the mixture in a 
manner that would increase the hazard over 
that of the pure substance. Furthermore, the 
mixture must not contain ingredients that 
would affect that determination. 
A.0.4.4 Synergistic or Antagonistic 
Effects 
When performing an assessment in 
accordance with these requirements, the 
evaluator must take into account all available 
information about the potential occurrence of 
synergistic effects among the ingredients of 
the mixture. Lowering classification of a 
mixture to a less hazardous category on the 
basis of antagonistic effects may be done only 
if the determination is supported by 
sufficient data. 
A.0.5 Bridging Principles for the 
Classification of Mixtures Where Test Data 
Are Not Available for the Complete Mixture 
A.0.5.1 Where the mixture itself has not 
been tested to determine its toxicity, but 
there are sufficient data on both the 
individual ingredients and similar tested 
mixtures to adequately characterize the 
hazards of the mixture, these data shall be 
used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles, subject to any specific 
provisions for mixtures for each hazard class.

These principles ensure that the 
classification process uses the available data 
to the greatest extent possible in 
characterizing the hazards of the mixture. 
A.0.5.1.1 Dilution 
For mixtures classified in accordance with 
A.1 through A.10 of this Appendix, if a tested 
mixture is diluted with a diluent that has an 
equivalent or lower toxicity classification 
than the least toxic original ingredient, and 
which is not expected to affect the toxicity 
of other ingredients, then: 
(a) the new diluted mixture shall be 
classified as equivalent to the original tested 
mixture; or 
(b) for classification of acute toxicity in 
accordance with A.1 of this Appendix, 
paragraph A.1.3.6 (the additivity formula) 
shall be applied. 
A.0.5.1.2 Batching 
For mixtures classified in accordance with 
A.1 through A.10 of this Appendix, the 
toxicity of a tested production batch of a 
mixture can be assumed to be substantially 
equivalent to that of another untested 
production batch of the same commercial 
product, when produced by or under the 
control of the same manufacturer, unless 
there is reason to believe there is significant 
variation such that the toxicity of the 
untested batch has changed. If the latter 
occurs, a new classification is necessary. 
A.0.5.1.3 Concentration of Mixtures 
For mixtures classified in accordance with 
A.1, A.2, A.3, A.8, A.9, or A.10 of this 
Appendix, if a tested mixture is classified in 
Category 1, and the concentration of the 
ingredients of the tested mixture that are in 
Category 1 is increased, the resulting 
untested mixture shall be classified in 
Category 1. 
A.0.5.1.4 Interpolation Within One Toxicity 
Category 
For mixtures classified in accordance with 
A.1, A.2, A.3, A.8, A.9, or A.10 of this 
Appendix, for three mixtures (A, B and C) 
with identical ingredients, where mixtures A 
and B have been tested and are in the same 
toxicity category, and where untested 
mixture C has the same toxicologically active 
ingredients as mixtures A and B but has 
concentrations of toxicologically active 
ingredients intermediate to the 
concentrations in mixtures A and B, then 
mixture C is assumed to be in the same 
toxicity category as A and B. 
A.0.5.1.5 Substantially Similar Mixtures 
For mixtures classified in accordance with 
A.1 through A.10 of this Appendix, given the 
following set of conditions: 
(a) Where there are two mixtures: (i) A + 
B; 
(ii) C + B; 
(b) the concentration of ingredient B is 
essentially the same in both mixtures; 
(c) the concentration of ingredient A in 
mixture (i) equals that of ingredient C in 
mixture (ii); 
(d) and data on toxicity for A and C are 
available and substantially equivalent; i.e., 
they are in the same hazard category and are 
not expected to affect the toxicity of B; then 
If mixture (i) or (ii) is already classified 
based on test data, the other mixture can be 
assigned the same hazard category. 
A.0.5.1.6 Aerosols 
For mixtures classified in accordance with 
A.1, A.2, A.3, A.4, A.8, or A.9 of this 
Appendix, an aerosol form of a mixture shall 
be classified in the same hazard category as 
the tested, non-aerosolized form of the 
mixture, provided the added propellant does 
not affect the toxicity of the mixture when 
spraying. 
A.1 ACUTE TOXICITY 
A.1.1 Definition 
Acute toxicity refers to those adverse 
effects occurring following oral or dermal 
administration of a single dose of a 
substance, or multiple doses given within 24 
hours, or an inhalation exposure of 4 hours. 
A.1.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
A.1.2.1 Substances can be allocated to 
one of four toxicity categories based on acute 
toxicity by the oral, dermal or inhalation 
route according to the numeric cut-off criteria 
as shown in Table A.1.1. Acute toxicity 
values are expressed as (approximate) LD50 
(oral, dermal) or LC50 (inhalation) values or 
as acute toxicity estimates (ATE). See the 
footnotes following Table A.1.1 for further 
explanation on the application of these 
values.

dermal toxicity. Test data already generated 
for the classification of chemicals under 
existing systems should be accepted when 
reclassifying these chemicals under the 
harmonized system. When experimental data 
for acute toxicity are available in several 
animal species, scientific judgment should be 
used in selecting the most appropriate LD50 
value from among scientifically validated 
tests. 
A.1.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 
A.1.3.1 The approach to classification of 
mixtures for acute toxicity is tiered, and is 
dependent upon the amount of information 
available for the mixture itself and for its 
ingredients. The flow chart of Figure A.1.1 
indicates the process that must be followed: 
A.1.3.2 Classification of mixtures for 
acute toxicity can be carried out for each 
route of exposure, but is only needed for one 
route of exposure as long as this route is 
followed (estimated or tested) for all 
ingredients and there is no relevant evidence 
to suggest acute toxicity by multiple routes. 
When there is relevant evidence of toxicity 
by multiple routes of exposure, classification 
is to be conducted for all appropriate routes 
of exposure. All available information shall 
be considered. The pictogram and signal 
word used shall reflect the most severe 
hazard category; and all relevant hazard 
statements shall be used. 
A.1.3.3 For purposes of classifying the 
hazards of mixtures in the tiered approach: 
(a) The ‘‘relevant ingredients’’ of a mixture 
are those which are present in concentrations 
≥ 1% (weight/weight for solids, liquids, 
dusts, mists and vapors and volume/volume 
for gases). If there is reason to suspect that 
an ingredient present at a concentration < 1% 
will affect classification of the mixture for 
acute toxicity, that ingredient shall also be 
considered relevant. Consideration of 
ingredients present at a concentration < 1% 
is particularly important when classifying 
untested mixtures which contain ingredients 
that are classified in Category 1 and Category 
2; 
(b) Where a classified mixture is used as 
an ingredient of another mixture, the actual 
or derived acute toxicity estimate (ATE) for 
that mixture is used when calculating the 
classification of the new mixture using the 
formulas in A.1.3.6.1 and A.1.3.6.2.3. 
(c) If the converted acute toxicity point 
estimates for all ingredients of a mixture are 
within the same category, then the mixture 
should be classified in that category. 
(d) When only range data (or acute toxicity 
hazard category information) are available for 
ingredients in a mixture, they may be 
converted to point estimates in accordance 
with Table A.1.2 when calculating the 
classification of the new mixture using the 
formulas in A.1.3.6.1 and A.1.3.6.2.3. 
A.1.3.4 Classification of Mixtures Where 
Acute Toxicity Test Data Are Available for 
the Complete Mixture 
Where the mixture itself has been tested to 
determine its acute toxicity, it is classified 
according to the same criteria as those used 
for substances, presented in Table A.1.1. If 
test data for the mixture are not available, the 
procedures presented below must be 
followed. 
A.1.3.5 Classification of Mixtures Where 
Acute Toxicity Test Data Are Not Available 
for the Complete Mixture: Bridging 
Principles 
A.1.3.5.1 Where the mixture itself has not 
been tested to determine its acute toxicity, 
but there are sufficient data on both the 
individual ingredients and similar tested 
mixtures to adequately characterize the 
hazards of the mixture, these data will be 
used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution, Batching, 
Concentration of mixtures, Interpolation 
within one toxicity category, Substantially 
similar mixtures, and Aerosols. 
A.1.3.6 Classification of Mixtures Based on 
Ingredients of the Mixture (Additivity 
Formula) 
A.1.3.6.1 Data Available for All Ingredients 
The acute toxicity estimate (ATE) of 
ingredients is considered as follows: 
(a) Include ingredients with a known acute 
toxicity, which fall into any of the acute 
toxicity categories; 
(b) Ignore ingredients that are presumed 
not acutely toxic (e.g., water, sugar); 
(c) Ignore ingredients if the data available 
are from a limit dose test (at the upper

threshold for Category 4 for the appropriate 
route of exposure as provided in Table A.1.1) 
and do not show acute toxicity. 
Ingredients that fall within the scope of 
this paragraph are considered to be 
ingredients with a known acute toxicity 
estimate (ATE). See note (b) to Table A.1.1 
and paragraph A.1.3.3 for appropriate 
application of available data to the equation 
below, and paragraph A.1.3.6.2.3.’’. 
The ATE of the mixture is determined by 
calculation from the ATE values for all 
relevant ingredients according to the 
following formula below for oral, dermal or 
inhalation toxicity: 
100
ATEmix
Ci
ATEin
= ∑
Where: 
Ci = concentration of ingredient i 
n ingredients and i is running from l to n 
ATEi = Acute toxicity estimate of ingredient 
i. 
A.1.3.6.2 Data Are Not Available for One or 
More Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.1.3.6.2.1 Where an ATE is not available 
for an individual ingredient of the mixture, 
but available information provides a derived 
conversion value, the formula in A.1.3.6.1 
may be applied. This information may 
include evaluation of: 
(a) Extrapolation between oral, dermal and 
inhalation acute toxicity estimates. Such an 
evaluation requires appropriate 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
data; 
(b) Evidence from human exposure that 
indicates toxic effects but does not provide 
lethal dose data; 
(c) Evidence from any other toxicity tests/ 
assays available on the substance that 
indicates toxic acute effects but does not 
necessarily provide lethal dose data; or 
(d) Data from closely analogous substances 
using structure/activity relationships. 
A.1.3.6.2.2 This approach requires 
substantial supplemental technical 
information, and a highly trained and 
experienced expert, to reliably estimate acute 
toxicity. If sufficient information is not 
available to reliably estimate acute toxicity, 
proceed to the provisions of A.1.3.6.2.3. 
A.1.3.6.2.3 In the event that an ingredient 
with unknown acute toxicity is used in a 
mixture at a concentration ≥ 1%, the mixture 
cannot be attributed a definitive acute 
toxicity estimate. In this situation the 
mixture is classified based on the known 
ingredients only. (Note: A statement that × 
percent of the mixture consists of 
ingredient(s) of unknown toxicity is required 
on the label and safety data sheet in such 
cases; see Appendix C, Allocation of Label 
Elements and Appendix D, Safety Data 
Sheets.) 
A.1.3.6.2.4 If the total concentration of 
the ingredient(s) with unknown acute 
toxicity is ≤ 10% then the formula presented 
in A.1.3.6.1 must be used. If the total 
concentration of the ingredient(s) with 
unknown toxicity is > 10%, the formula 
presented in A.1.3.6.1 is corrected to adjust 
for the total percentage of the unknown 
ingredient(s) as follows:

A.2 SKIN CORROSION/IRRITATION 
A.2.1 Definitions 
Skin corrosion is the production of 
irreversible damage to the skin; namely, 
visible necrosis through the epidermis and 
into the dermis, following the application of 
a test substance for up to 4 hours. Corrosive 
reactions are typified by ulcers, bleeding, 
bloody scabs, and, by the end of observation 
at 14 days, by discoloration due to blanching 
of the skin, complete areas of alopecia, and 
scars. Histopathology should be considered 
to evaluate questionable lesions. 
Skin irritation is the production of 
reversible damage to the skin following the 
application of a test substance for up to 4 
hours. 
A.2.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
Using Test Data 
A.2.2.1 Corrosion 
A.2.2.2 A single harmonized corrosion 
category is provided in Table A.2.1, using the 
results of animal testing. A corrosive is a 
substance that produces destruction of skin 
tissue, namely, visible necrosis through the 
epidermis and into the dermis, in at least 1 
of 3 tested animals after exposure up to a 4 
hour duration. Corrosive reactions are 
typified by ulcers, bleeding, bloody scabs 
and, by the end of observation at 14 days, by 
discoloration due to blanching of the skin, 
complete areas of alopecia and scars. 
Histopathology should be considered to 
discern questionable lesions. 
A.2.2.3 Three sub-categories of Category 1 
are provided in Table A.2.1, all of which will 
be regulated as Category 1.  
TABLE A.2.1—SKIN CORROSION CATEGORY AND SUB-CATEGORIES a 
Category 1: Corrosive Corrosive sub- categories 
Corrosive in ≥ 1 of 3 animals 
Exposure Observation 
1A .......................... ≤ 3 min .................. ≤ 1 h. 
1B .......................... > 3 min ≤ 1 h ........ ≤ 14 days. 
1C .......................... > 1 h ≤ 4 h ............ ≤ 14 days. 
a The use of human data is discussed in Appendix A.0.2.6. 
A.2.3 Irritation 
A.2.3.1 A single irritant category 
(Category 2) is presented in the Table A.2.2. 
The major criterion for the irritant category 
is that at least 2 tested animals have a mean 
score of ≥ 2.3 ≤ 4.0. 
TABLE A.2.2—SKIN IRRITATION CATEGORY a 
Criteria 
Irritant (Category 2) .............. (1) Mean value of ≥ 2.3 ≤ 4.0 for erythema/eschar or for oedema in at least 2 of 3 tested animals from gradings 
at 24, 48 and 72 hours after patch removal or, if reactions are delayed, from grades on 3 consecutive days 
after the onset of skin reactions; or 
(2) Inflammation that persists to the end of the observation period normally 14 days in at least 2 animals, particu-
larly taking into account alopecia (limited area), hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, and scaling; or 
(3) In some cases where there is pronounced variability of response among animals, with very definite positive 
effects related to chemical exposure in a single animal but less than the criteria above. 
a The use of human data is discussed in Appendix A.0. 
A.2.3.2 Animal irritant responses within 
a test can be quite variable, as they are with 
corrosion. A separate irritant criterion 
accommodates cases when there is a 
significant irritant response but less than the 
mean score criterion for a positive test. For 
example, a substance might be designated as 
an irritant if at least 1 of 3 tested animals 
shows a very elevated mean score throughout 
the study, including lesions persisting at the 
end of an observation period of normally 14 
days. Other responses could also fulfil this 
criterion. However, it should be ascertained 
that the responses are the result of chemical 
exposure. Addition of this criterion increases 
the sensitivity of the classification system. 
A.2.3.3 Reversibility of skin lesions is 
another consideration in evaluating irritant 
responses. When inflammation persists to the 
end of the observation period in 2 or more 
test animals, taking into consideration 
alopecia (limited area), hyperkeratosis, 
hyperplasia and scaling, then a material 
should be considered to be an irritant. 
A.2.4 Classification Criteria for Substances 
Using Other Data Elements 
A.2.4.1 Several factors must be 
considered in determining the corrosion and 
irritation potential of substances when no 
clear data exist for those substances: 
• Solid substances (powders) may become 
corrosive or irritant when moistened or in 
contact with moist skin or mucous 
membranes. 
• Existing human experience and data 
including from single or repeated exposure 
and animal observations and data shall be the 
first line of analysis, as they give information 
directly relevant to effects on the skin. 
• In some cases enough information may 
be available from structurally related 
compounds to make classification decisions. 
• pH extremes ≤ 2 and ≥ 11.5 may indicate 
skin effects, especially when buffering 
capacity is known, although the correlation 
is not perfect. Generally, such agents are 
expected to produce significant effects on the 
skin. 
• If a chemical is highly toxic by the 
dermal route, data from dermal testing for 
skin irritation/corrosion may not be available 
since the amount of test substance to be 
applied would considerably exceed the toxic 
dose and, consequently, would result in the 
death of the animals. 
• In vitro alternatives that have been 
validated and accepted may also be used to 
help make classification decisions. 
All the above information that is available 
on a substance shall be evaluated. Although 
information might be gained from the 
evaluation of single parameters within a tier 
(see A.2.4), there is merit in considering the 
totality of existing information and making 
an overall weight of evidence determination. 
This is especially true when there is 
information available on some but not all 
parameters. Primary emphasis shall be 
placed upon existing human experience and 
data, followed by animal experience and 
testing data, followed by other sources of 
information, but case-by-case determinations 
are necessary. 
A.2.4.2 A tiered approach to the 
evaluation of initial information shall be 
considered, where applicable (Figure A.2.1), 
recognizing that all elements may not be 
relevant in certain cases.

A.2.5 Classification Curiteria for 
Mixtures 
A.2.5.1 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Available for the 
Complete Mixture 
A.2.5.1.1 The mixture shall be 
classified using the criteria for 
substances (see A.2.2 to A.2.4). 
A.2.5.2 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Not Available for the 
Complete Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.2.5.2.1 Where the mixture itself 
has not been tested to determine its skin 
irritation/corrosion, but there are 
sufficient data on both the individual 
ingredients and similar tested mixtures 
to adequately characterize the hazards 
of the mixture, these data will be used 
in accordance with the following 
bridging principles, as found in 
paragraph A.0.5 of this Appendix: 
Dilution, Batching, Concentration of 
mixtures, Interpolation within one 
toxicity category, Substantially similar 
mixtures, and Aerosols. 
A.2.5.3 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Available for All 
Ingredients or Only for Some 
Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.2.5.3.1 In order to make use of all 
available data for purposes of classifying 
the skin irritation/corrosion hazards of 
mixtures, the following assumption has 
been made and is applied where 
appropriate in the tiered approach: 
The ‘‘relevant ingredients’’ of a 
mixture are those which are present in 
concentrations ≥ 1% (w/w for solids, 
liquids, dusts, mists and vapors and v/ 
v for gases), unless there is a 
presumption (e.g. in the case of 
corrosive ingredients) that an ingredient 
present at a concentration < 1% can still 
be relevant for classifying the mixture 
for skin irritation/corrosion. 
A.2.5.3.2 In general, the approach to 
classification of mixtures as irritant or 
corrosive to skin when data are 
available on the ingredients, but not on 
the mixture as a whole, is based on the 
theory of additivity, such that each 
corrosive or irritant ingredient 
contributes to the overall irritant or 
corrosive properties of the mixture in 
proportion to its potency and 
concentration. A weighting factor of 10 
is used for corrosive ingredients when 
they are present at a concentration 
below the concentration limit for 
classification with Category 1, but are at 
a concentration that will contribute to 
the classification of the mixture as an 
irritant. The mixture is classified as 
corrosive or irritant when the sum of the 
concentrations of such ingredients 
exceeds a cut-off value/concentration 
limit. 
A.2.5.3.3 Table A.2.3 below 
provides the cut-off value/concentration 
limits to be used to determine if the 
mixture is considered to be an irritant 
or a corrosive to the skin. 
A.2.5.3.4 Particular care shall be 
taken when classifying certain types of 
chemicals such as acids and bases, 
inorganic salts, aldehydes, phenols, and 
surfactants. The approach explained in 
A.2.5.3.1 and A.2.5.3.2 might not work 
given that many of such substances are 
corrosive or irritant at concentrations < 
1%. For mixtures containing strong 
acids or bases the pH should be used as 
classification criteria since pH will be a 
better indicator of corrosion than the 
concentration limits of Table A.2.3. A 
mixture containing corrosive or irritant 
ingredients that cannot be classified 
based on the additivity approach shown 
in Table A.2.3, due to chemical 
characteristics that make this approach 
unworkable, should be classified as skin 
Category 1 if it contains ≥ 1% of a 
corrosive ingredient and as skin 
Category 2 when it contains ≥ 3% of an 
irritant ingredient. Classification of 
mixtures with ingredients for which the 
approach in Table A.2.3 does not apply 
is summarized in Table A.2.4 below. 
A.2.5.3.5 On occasion, reliable data 
may show that the skin corrosion/ 
irritation of an ingredient will not be 
evident when present at a level above 
the generic concentration cut-off values 
mentioned in Tables 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. In 
these cases the mixture could be 
classified according to those data (see 
Use of concentration limits, paragraph 
A.0.4.3 of this Appendix). 
A.2.5.3.6 If there are data showing 
that (an) ingredient(s) may be corrosive 
or irritant at a concentration of < 1% 
(corrosive) or < 3% (irritant), the 
mixture shall be classified accordingly 
(see Use of concentration limits, 
paragraph A.0.4.3 of this Appendix).

Serious eye damage is the production of 
tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical 
decay of vision, following application of a 
test substance to the anterior surface of the 
eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 
days of application. 
Eye irritation is the production of changes 
in the eye following the application of test 
substance to the anterior surface of the eye, 
which are fully reversible within 21 days of 
application. 
A.3.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
Using Test Data 
A.3.2.1 Irreversible Effects on the Eye/ 
Serious Damage to Eyes (Category 1) 
A single hazard category is provided in 
Table A.3.1, for substances that have the 
potential to seriously damage the eyes. 
Category 1, irreversible effects on the eye, 
includes the criteria listed below. These 
observations include animals with grade 4 
cornea lesions and other severe reactions (e.g. 
destruction of cornea) observed at any time 
during the test, as well as persistent corneal 
opacity, discoloration of the cornea by a dye 
substance, adhesion, pannus, and 
interference with the function of the iris or 
other effects that impair sight. In this context, 
persistent lesions are considered those which 
are not fully reversible within an observation 
period of normally 21 days. Category 1 also 
contains substances fulfilling the criteria of 
corneal opacity ≥ 3 or iritis > 1.5 detected in 
a Draize eye test with rabbits, because severe 
lesions like these usually do not reverse 
within a 21-day observation period. 
BILLING CODE 4510–26–P 
A.3.2.2 Reversible Effects on the Eye 
(Category 2) 
A single category is provided in Table 
A.3.2 for substances that have the 
potential to induce reversible eye 
irritation.

For those chemicals where there is 
pronounced variability among animal 
responses, this information may be 
taken into account in determining the 
classification. 
A.3.3 Classification Criteria for 
Substances Using Other Data Elements 
A.3.3.1 A tiered evaluation scheme 
that combines pre-existing information 
on serious ocular tissue damage and on 
eye irritation (including data relating to 
historical human or animal experience) 
as well as considerations on structure- 
activity relationships (SAR) or structure- 
property relationships (SPR) and the 
output of validated in vitro tests shall be 
used for substances where no clear test 
data exist for those substances: 
A.3.3.2 All existing information on a 
substance shall be reviewed and several 
factors considered in determining the 
serious eye damage or irritation 
potential of substances: 
• Accumulated human and animal 
data shall be the first line of analysis, as 
it gives information directly relevant to 
effects on the eye. 
• In some cases enough information 
may be available from structurally 
related compounds to make hazard 
decisions. 
• Likewise, pH extremes like ≥ 2 and 
> 11.5 may produce serious eye damage, 
especially when associated with 
significant buffering capacity. Such 
agents are expected to produce 
significant effects on the eyes. 
• Possible skin corrosion has to be 
evaluated prior to consideration of 
serious eye damage/eye irritation in 
order to avoid testing for local effects on 
eyes with skin corrosive substances. 
• In vitro alternatives that have been 
validated and accepted may be used to 
make classification decisions. 
A.3.3.3 All the above information 
that is available on a substance shall be 
evaluated. Although information might 
be gained from the evaluation of single 
parameters within a tier, there is merit 
in considering the totality of existing 
information and making an overall 
weight of evidence determination. This 
is especially true when there is 
information available on some but not 
all parameters. Generally, primary 
emphasis shall be placed upon expert 
judgment, considering human 
experience with the substance, followed 
by the outcome of skin irritation testing 
and of well validated alternative 
methods. 
A.3.3.4 A tiered approach to the 
evaluation of initial information shall be 
considered where applicable, 
recognizing that all elements may not be 
relevant in certain cases (Figure A.3.1). 
A.3.3.5 The proposed tiered testing 
approach provides good guidance on 
how to organize existing information on 
a substance and to make a weight-of- 
evidence decision, where appropriate, 
about hazard assessment and hazard 
classification.

A.3.4 Classification Criteria for 
Mixtures 
A.3.4.1 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Available for the 
Complete Mixture 
A.3.4.1.1 The mixture will be 
classified using the criteria for 
substances, and taking into account the 
testing and evaluation strategies used to 
develop data for these hazard classes. 
A.3.4.1.2 Unlike other hazard 
classes, there are alternative tests 
available for skin corrosivity of certain 
types of chemicals that can give an 
accurate result for classification 
purposes, as well as being simple and 
relatively inexpensive to perform. When 
considering testing of the mixture, 
manufacturers are encouraged to use a 
tiered weight of evidence strategy as 
included in the criteria for classification 
of substances for skin corrosion and 
serious eye damage and eye irritation to 
help ensure an accurate classification, 
as well as avoid unnecessary animal 
testing. A mixture is considered to cause 
serious eye damage (Eye Category 1) if 
it has a pH ≤ 2 or ≥ 11.5. If consideration 
of alkali/acid reserve suggests the 
substance or mixture may not have the 
potential to cause serious eye damage 
despite the low or high pH value, then 
further testing needs to be carried out to 
confirm this, preferably by use of an 
appropriate validated in vitro test. 
A.3.4.2 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Not Available for the 
Complete Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.3.4.2.1 Where the mixture itself 
has not been tested to determine its skin 
corrosivity or potential to cause serious 
eye damage or irritation, but there are 
sufficient data on both the individual 
ingredients and similar tested mixtures 
to adequately characterize the hazards 
of the mixture, these data will be used 
in accordance with the following 
bridging principles, as found in 
paragraph A.0.5 of this Appendix: 
Dilution, Batching, Concentration of 
mixtures, Interpolation within one 
toxicity category, Substantially similar 
mixtures, and Aerosols. 
A.3.4.3 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Available for All 
Ingredients or Only for Some 
Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.3.4.3.1 In order to make use of all 
available data for purposes of classifying 
the eye irritation/serious eye damaging 
properties of the mixtures, the following 
assumption has been made and is 
applied where appropriate in the tiered 
approach: 
The ‘‘relevant ingredients’’ of a 
mixture are those which are present in 
concentrations ≥ 1% (w/w for solids, 
liquids, dusts, mists and vapours and 
v/v for gases), unless there is a 
presumption (e.g., in the case of 
corrosive ingredients) that an ingredient 
present at a concentration < 1% can still 
be relevant for classifying the mixture 
for eye irritation/serious eye damage. 
A.3.4.3.2 In general, the approach to 
classification of mixtures as eye irritant 
or seriously damaging to the eye when 
data are available on the ingredients, but 
not on the mixture as a whole, is based 
on the theory of additivity, such that 
each corrosive or irritant ingredient 
contributes to the overall irritant or 
corrosive properties of the mixture in 
proportion to its potency and 
concentration. A weighting factor of 10 
is used for corrosive ingredients when 
they are present at a concentration 
below the concentration limit for 
classification with Category 1, but are at 
a concentration that will contribute to 
the classification of the mixture as an 
irritant. 
The mixture is classified as seriously 
damaging to the eye or eye irritant when 
the sum of the concentrations of such 
ingredients exceeds a threshold cut-off 
value/concentration limit. 
A.3.4.3.3 Table A.3.3 provides the 
cut-off value/concentration limits to be 
used to determine if the mixture should 
be classified an irritant or as seriously 
damaging to the eye. 
A.3.4.3.4 Particular care must be 
taken when classifying certain types of 
chemicals such as acids and bases, 
inorganic salts, aldehydes, phenols, and 
surfactants. The approach explained in 
A.3.4.3.1 and A.3.4.3.2 might not work 
given that many of such substances are 
corrosive or irritant at concentrations 
< 1%. For mixtures containing strong 
acids or bases, the pH should be used 
as classification criteria (see A.3.4.1) 
since pH will be a better indicator of 
serious eye damage than the 
concentration limits of Table A.3.3. A 
mixture containing corrosive or irritant 
ingredients that cannot be classified 
based on the additivity approach 
applied in Table A.3.3 due to chemical 
characteristics that make this approach 
unworkable, should be classified as Eye 
Category 1 if it contains ≥ 1% of a 
corrosive ingredient and as Eye Category 
2 when it contains ≥ 3% of an irritant 
ingredient. Classification of mixtures 
with ingredients for which the approach 
in Table A.3.3 does not apply is 
summarized in Table A.3.4. 
A.3.4.3.5 On occasion, reliable data 
may show that the reversible/ 
irreversible eye effects of an ingredient 
will not be evident when present at a 
level above the generic cut-off values/ 
concentration limits mentioned in 
Tables A.3.3 and A.3.4. In these cases 
the mixture could be classified 
according to those data (see also A.0.4.3 
Use of concentration limits). On 
occasion, when it is expected that the 
skin corrosion/irritation or the 
reversible/irreversible eye effects of an 
ingredient will not be evident when 
present at a level above the generic 
concentration/cut-off levels mentioned 
in Tables A.3.3 and A.3.4, testing of the 
mixture may be considered. In those 
cases, the tiered weight of evidence 
strategy should be applied as referred to 
in section A.3.3, Figure A.3.1 and 
explained in detail in this chapter. 
A.3.4.3.6 If there are data showing 
that (an) ingredient(s) may be corrosive 
or irritant at a concentration of < 1% 
(corrosive) or < 3% (irritant), the 
mixture should be classified accordingly 
(see also paragraph A.0.4.3,Use of 
concentration limits).

A.4 RESPIRATORY OR SKIN 
SENSITIZATION 
A.4.1 Definitions and General 
Considerations 
A.4.1.1 Respiratory sensitizer means a 
chemical that will lead to hypersensitivity of 
the airways following inhalation of the 
chemical. 
Skin sensitizer means a chemical that will 
lead to an allergic response following skin 
contact. 
A.4.1.2 For the purpose of this chapter, 
sensitization includes two phases: The first 
phase is induction of specialized 
immunological memory in an individual by 
exposure to an allergen. The second phase is 
elicitation, i.e., production of a cell-mediated 
or antibody-mediated allergic response by 
exposure of a sensitized individual to an 
allergen. 
A.4.1.3 For respiratory sensitization, the 
pattern of induction followed by elicitation 
phases is shared in common with skin 
sensitization. For skin sensitization, an 
induction phase is required in which the 
immune system learns to react; clinical 
symptoms can then arise when subsequent 
exposure is sufficient to elicit a visible skin 
reaction (elicitation phase). As a 
consequence, predictive tests usually follow 
this pattern in which there is an induction 
phase, the response to which is measured by 
a standardized elicitation phase, typically 
involving a patch test. The local lymph node 
assay is the exception, directly measuring the 
induction response. Evidence of skin 
sensitization in humans normally is assessed 
by a diagnostic patch test. 
A.4.1.4 Usually, for both skin and 
respiratory sensitization, lower levels are 
necessary for elicitation than are required for 
induction. 
A.4.1.5 The hazard class ‘‘respiratory or 
skin sensitization’’ is differentiated into: 
(a) Respiratory sensitization; and 
(b) Skin sensitization 
A.4.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
A.4.2.1 Respiratory Sensitizers 
A.4.2.1.1 Hazard Categories 
A.4.2.1.1.1 Effects seen in either humans 
or animals will normally justify classification 
in a weight of evidence approach for 
respiratory sensitizers. Substances may be 
allocated to one of the two sub-categories 1A 
or 1B using a weight of evidence approach 
in accordance with the criteria given in Table 
A.4.1 and on the basis of reliable and good 
quality evidence from human cases or 
epidemiological studies and/or observations 
from appropriate studies in experimental 
animals. 
TABLE A.4.1—HAZARD CATEGORY AND SUB-CATEGORIES FOR RESPIRATORY SENSITIZERS 
Category 1: Respiratory sensitizer 
A substance is classified as a respiratory sensitizer: 
(a) if there is evidence in humans that the substance can lead to specific respiratory hypersensitivity and/or 
(b) if there are positive results from an appropriate animal test.19 
Sub-category 1A .................. Substances showing a high frequency of occurrence in humans; or a probability of occurrence of a high sensitiza-
tion rate in humans based on animal or other tests.1 Severity of reaction may also be considered. 
Sub-category 1B .................. Substances showing a low to moderate frequency of occurrence in humans; or a probability of occurrence of a 
low to moderate sensitization rate in humans based on animal or other tests.1 Severity of reaction may also be 
considered. 
A.4.2.1.2 Human evidence 
A.4.2.1.2.1 Evidence that a substance can 
lead to specific respiratory hypersensitivity 
will normally be based on human experience. 
In this context, hypersensitivity is normally 
seen as asthma, but other hypersensitivity 
reactions such as rhinitis/conjunctivitis and 
alveolitis are also considered. The condition 
will have the clinical character of an allergic 
reaction. However, immunological 
mechanisms do not have to be demonstrated. 
A.4.2.1.2.2 When considering the human 
evidence, it is necessary that in addition to 
the evidence from the cases, the following be 
taken into account: 
(a) the size of the population exposed; 
(b) the extent of exposure. 
A.4.2.1.2.3 The evidence referred to 
above could be: 
(a) clinical history and data from 
appropriate lung function tests related to 
exposure to the substance, confirmed by 
other supportive evidence which may 
include: 
(i) in vivo immunological test (e.g., skin 
prick test); 
(ii) in vitro immunological test (e.g., 
serological analysis);

1 At this writing, recognized and validated animal 
models for the testing of respiratory 
hypersensitivity are not available. Under certain 
circumstances, data from animal studies may 
provide valuable information in a weight of 
evidence assessment. 
20 The mechanisms by which substances induce 
symptoms of asthma are not yet fully known. For 
preventative measures, these substances are 
considered respiratory sensitizers. However, if on 
the basis of the evidence, it can be demonstrated 
that these substances induce symptoms of asthma 
by irritation only in people with bronchial 
hyperreactivity, they should not be considered as 
respiratory sensitizers. 
21 Test methods for skin sensitization are 
described in OECD Guideline 406 (the Guinea Pig 
Maximization test and the Buehler guinea pig test) 
and Guideline 429 (Local Lymph Node Assay). 
Other methods may be used provided that they are 
scientifically validated. The Mouse Ear Swelling 
Test (MEST), appears to be a reliable screening test 
to detect moderate to strong sensitizers, and can be 
used, in accordance with professional judgment, as 
a first stage in the assessment of skin sensitization 
potential. 
(iii) studies that may indicate other specific 
hypersensitivity reactions where 
immunological mechanisms of action have 
not been proven, e.g., repeated low-level 
irritation, pharmacologically mediated 
effects; 
(iv) a chemical structure related to 
substances known to cause respiratory 
hypersensitivity; 
(b) data from positive bronchial challenge 
tests with the substance conducted according 
to accepted guidelines for the determination 
of a specific hypersensitivity reaction. 
A.4.2.1.2.4 Clinical history should 
include both medical and occupational 
history to determine a relationship between 
exposure to a specific substance and 
development of respiratory hypersensitivity. 
Relevant information includes aggravating 
factors both in the home and workplace, the 
onset and progress of the disease, family 
history and medical history of the patient in 
question. The medical history should also 
include a note of other allergic or airway 
disorders from childhood and smoking 
history. 
A.4.2.1.2.5 The results of positive 
bronchial challenge tests are considered to 
provide sufficient evidence for classification 
on their own. It is, however, recognized that 
in practice many of the examinations listed 
above will already have been carried out. 
A.4.2.1.3 Animal Studies 
A.4.2.1.3.1 Data from appropriate animal 
studies 1 which may be indicative of the 
potential of a substance to cause sensitization 
by inhalation in humans 20 may include: 
(a) measurements of Immunoglobulin E 
(IgE) and other specific immunological 
parameters, for example in mice; 
(b) specific pulmonary responses in guinea 
pigs. 
A.4.2.2 Skin Sensitizers 
A.4.2.2.1 Hazard Categories 
A.4.2.2.1.1 Effects seen in either humans 
or animals will normally justify classification 
in a weight of evidence approach for skin 
sensitizers. Substances may be allocated to 
one of the two sub-categories 1A or 1B using 
a weight of evidence approach in accordance 
with the criteria given in Table A.4.2 and on 
the basis of reliable and good quality 
evidence from human cases or 
epidemiological studies and/or observations 
from appropriate studies in experimental 
animals according to the guidance values 
provided in A.4.2.2.2.1 and A.4.2.2.3.2 for 
sub-category 1A and in A.4.2.2.2.2 and 
A.4.2.2.3.3 for sub-category 1B. 
TABLE A.4.2—HAZARD CATEGORY AND SUB-CATEGORIES FOR SKIN SENSITIZERS 
Category 1: Skin sensitizer 
A substance is classified as a skin sensitizer: 
(a) if there is evidence in humans that the substance can lead to sensitization by skin contact in a substantial number of 
persons, or 
(b) if there are positive results from an appropriate animal test. 
Sub-category 1A Substances showing a high frequency of occurrence in humans and/or a high potency in animals can be presumed to have 
the potential to produce significant sensitization in humans. Severity of reaction may also be considered. 
Sub-category 1B Substances showing a low to moderate frequency of occurrence in humans and/or a low to moderate potency in animals can 
be presumed to have the potential to produce sensitization in humans. Severity of reaction may also be considered. 
A.4.2.2.2 Human Evidence 
A.4.2.2.2.1 Human evidence for sub- 
category 1A may include: 
(a) positive responses at ≤500 μg/cm2 
(HRIPT, HMT—induction threshold); 
(b) diagnostic patch test data where there 
is a relatively high and substantial incidence 
of reactions in a defined population in 
relation to relatively low exposure; 
(c) other epidemiological evidence where 
there is a relatively high and substantial 
incidence of allergic contact dermatitis in 
relation to relatively low exposure. 
A.4.2.2.2.2 Human evidence for sub- 
category 1B may include: 
(a) positive responses at >500 μg/cm2 
(HRIPT, HMT—induction threshold); 
(b) diagnostic patch test data where there 
is a relatively low but substantial incidence 
of reactions in a defined population in 
relation to relatively high exposure; 
(c) other epidemiological evidence where 
there is a relatively low but substantial 
incidence of allergic contact dermatitis in 
relation to relatively high exposure. 
A.4.2.2.3 Animal Studies 
A.4.2.2.3.1 For Category 1, when an 
adjuvant type test method for skin 
sensitization is used, a response of at least 
30% of the animals is considered as positive. 
For a non-adjuvant Guinea pig test method a 
response of at least 15% of the animals is 
considered positive. For Category 1, a 
stimulation index of three or more is 
considered a positive response in the local 
lymph node assay.21 
A.4.2.2.3.2 Animal test results for sub- 
category 1A can include data with values 
indicated in Table A.4.3.

A.4.2.2.4 Specific Considerations 
A.4.2.2.4.1 For classification of a 
substance, evidence should include any or all 
of the following using a weight of evidence 
approach: 
(a) Positive data from patch testing, 
normally obtained in more than one 
dermatology clinic; 
(b) Epidemiological studies showing 
allergic contact dermatitis caused by the 
substance. Situations in which a high 
proportion of those exposed exhibit 
characteristic symptoms are to be looked at 
with special concern, even if the number of 
cases is small; 
(c) Positive data from appropriate animal 
studies; 
(d) Positive data from experimental studies 
in man (see paragraph A.0.2.6 of this 
Appendix); 
(e) Well documented episodes of allergic 
contact dermatitis, normally obtained in 
more than one dermatology clinic; 
(f) Severity of reaction may also be 
considered. 
A.4.2.2.4.2 Evidence from animal studies 
is usually much more reliable than evidence 
from human exposure. However, in cases 
where evidence is available from both 
sources, and there is conflict between the 
results, the quality and reliability of the 
evidence from both sources must be assessed 
in order to resolve the question of 
classification on a case-by-case basis. 
Normally, human data are not generated in 
controlled experiments with volunteers for 
the purpose of hazard classification but 
rather as part of risk assessment to confirm 
lack of effects seen in animal tests. 
Consequently, positive human data on skin 
sensitization are usually derived from case- 
control or other, less defined studies. 
Evaluation of human data must, therefore, be 
carried out with caution as the frequency of 
cases reflect, in addition to the inherent 
properties of the substances, factors such as 
the exposure situation, bioavailability, 
individual predisposition and preventive 
measures taken. Negative human data should 
not normally be used to negate positive 
results from animal studies. For both animal 
and human data, consideration should be 
given to the impact of vehicle. 
A.4.2.2.4.3 If none of the above- 
mentioned conditions are met, the substance 
need not be classified as a skin sensitizer. 
However, a combination of two or more 
indicators of skin sensitization, as listed 
below, may alter the decision. This shall be 
considered on a case-by-case basis. 
(a) Isolated episodes of allergic contact 
dermatitis; 
(b) Epidemiological studies of limited 
power, e.g., where chance, bias or 
confounders have not been ruled out fully 
with reasonable confidence; 
(c) Data from animal tests, performed 
according to existing guidelines, which do 
not meet the criteria for a positive result 
described in A.4.2.2.3, but which are 
sufficiently close to the limit to be 
considered significant; 
(d) Positive data from non-standard 
methods; 
(e) Positive results from close structural 
analogues. 
A.4.2.2.4.4 Immunological Contact Urticaria 
A.4.2.2.4.4.1 Substances meeting the 
criteria for classification as respiratory 
sensitizers may, in addition, cause 
immunological contact urticaria. 
Consideration shall be given to classifying 
these substances as skin sensitizers. 
A.4.2.2.4.4.2 Substances which cause 
immunological contact urticaria without 
meeting the criteria for respiratory sensitizers 
shall be considered for classification as skin 
sensitizers. 
A.4.2.2.4.4.3 There is no recognized 
animal model available to identify substances 
which cause immunological contact urticaria. 
Therefore, classification will normally be 
based on human evidence, similar to that for 
skin sensitization. 
A.4.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 
A.4.3.1 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data are Available for the Complete Mixture 
When reliable and good quality evidence, 
as described in the criteria for substances, 
from human experience or appropriate 
studies in experimental animals, is available 
for the mixture, then the mixture can be 
classified by weight of evidence evaluation of 
these data. Care must be exercised in 
evaluating data on mixtures that the dose 
used does not render the results 
inconclusive. 
A.4.3.2 Classification of Mixtures 
When Data Are Not Available for the 
Complete Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.4.3.2.1 Where the mixture itself has not 
been tested to determine its sensitizing 
properties, but there are sufficient data on 
both the individual ingredients and similar 
tested mixtures to adequately characterize 
the hazards of the mixture, these data will be 
used in accordance with the following agreed 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution, Batching, 
Concentration of mixtures, Interpolation, 
Substantially similar mixtures, and Aerosols. 
A.4.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data are Available for all Ingredients or Only 
for Some Ingredients of the Mixture 
The mixture shall be classified as a 
respiratory or skin sensitizer when at least 
one ingredient has been classified as a 
respiratory or skin sensitizer and is present 
at or above the appropriate cut-off value/ 
concentration limit for the specific endpoint 
as shown in Table A.4.5.

A.5 GERM CELL MUTAGENICITY 
A.5.1 Definitions and General 
Considerations 
A.5.1.1 A mutation is defined as a 
permanent change in the amount or structure 
of the genetic material in a cell. The term 
mutation applies both to heritable genetic 
changes that may be manifested at the 
phenotypic level and to the underlying DNA 
modifications when known (including, for 
example, specific base pair changes and 
chromosomal translocations). The term 
mutagenic and mutagen will be used for 
agents giving rise to an increased occurrence 
of mutations in populations of cells and/or 
organisms. 
A.5.1.2 The more general terms genotoxic 
and genotoxicity apply to agents or processes 
which alter the structure, information 
content, or segregation of DNA, including 
those which cause DNA damage by 
interfering with normal replication processes, 
or which in a non-physiological manner 
(temporarily) alter its replication. 
Genotoxicity test results are usually taken as 
indicators for mutagenic effects. 
A.5.1.3 This hazard class is primarily 
concerned with chemicals that may cause 
mutations in the germ cells of humans that 
can be transmitted to the progeny. However, 
mutagenicity/genotoxicity tests in vitro and 
in mammalian somatic cells in vivo are also 
considered in classifying substances and 
mixtures within this hazard class. 
A.5.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
A.5.2.1 The classification system 
provides for two different categories of germ 
cell mutagens to accommodate the weight of 
evidence available. The two-category system 
is described in the Figure A.5.1.

22 It should be noted that the classification criteria 
for the GHS usually include a tiered scheme in 
which test data available on the complete mixture 
are considered as the first tier in the evaluation, 
followed by the applicable bridging principles, and 
lastly, cut-off values/concentration or additivity. 
However, this approach is not used for Germ Cell 
Mutagenicity. These criteria for Germ Cell 
Mutagenicity consider the cut-off levels as the 
primary tier and allow the classification to be 
modified only on a case-by-case evaluation based 
on available test data for the mixture as a whole. 
BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
A.5.2.2 Specific considerations for 
classification of substances as germ cell 
mutagens: 
A.5.2.2.1 To arrive at a classification, test 
results are considered from experiments 
determining mutagenic and/or genotoxic 
effects in germ and/or somatic cells of 
exposed animals. Mutagenic and/or 
genotoxic effects determined in in vitro tests 
shall also be considered. 
A.5.2.2.2 The system is hazard based, 
classifying chemicals on the basis of their 
intrinsic ability to induce mutations in germ 
cells. The scheme is, therefore, not meant for 
the (quantitative) risk assessment of chemical 
substances. 
A.5.2.2.3 Classification for heritable 
effects in human germ cells is made on the 
basis of scientifically validated tests.1 
Evaluation of the test results shall be done 
using expert judgment and all the available 
evidence shall be weighed for classification. 
A.5.2.2.4 The classification of substances 
shall be based on the total weight of evidence 
available, using expert judgment. In those 
instances where a single well-conducted test 
is used for classification, it shall provide 
clear and unambiguously positive results. 
The relevance of the route of exposure used 
in the study of the substance compared to the 
route of human exposure should also be 
taken into account. 
A.5.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 22 
A.5.3.1 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for All Ingredients or 
Only for Some Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.5.3.1.1 Classification of mixtures shall 
be based on the available test data for the 
individual ingredients of the mixture using 
cut-off values/concentration limits for the 
ingredients classified as germ cell mutagens. 
A.5.3.1.2 The mixture will be classified 
as a mutagen when at least one ingredient 
has been classified as a Category 1A, 
Category 1B or Category 2 mutagen and is 
present at or above the appropriate cut-off 
value/concentration limit as shown in Table 
A.5.1 below for Category 1 and 2 
respectively.

guidance regarding hazard classification for 
carcinogenicity. This appendix is consistent with 
the GHS and is provided as guidance excerpted 
from monographs of the International Agency for 
Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs programme 
on the evaluation of the strength and evidence of 
carcinogenic risks to humans.

Category 2 mutagen ................................................................................................................................ ................................ ≥ 1.0%. 
Note: The cut-off values/concentration limits in the table above apply to solids and liquids (w/w units) as well as gases (v/v units). 
A.5.3.2 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for the Mixture Itself 
The classification may be modified on a 
case-by-case basis based on the available test 
data for the mixture as a whole. In such 
cases, the test results for the mixture as a 
whole must be shown to be conclusive taking 
into account dose and other factors such as 
duration, observations and analysis (e.g. 
statistical analysis, test sensitivity) of germ 
cell mutagenicity test systems. 
A.5.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Not Available for the Complete 
Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.5.3.3.1 Where the mixture itself has not 
been tested to determine its germ cell 
mutagenicity hazard, but there are sufficient 
data on both the individual ingredients and 
similar tested mixtures to adequately 
characterize the hazards of the mixture, these 
data will be used in accordance with the 
following bridging principles as found in 
paragraph A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution, 
Batching, and Substantially similar mixtures. 
Examples of in vivo heritable germ cell 
mutagenicity tests are: 
• Rodent dominant lethal mutation test 
(OECD 478) 
• Mouse heritable translocation assay 
(OECD 485) 
• Mouse specific locus test 
Examples of in vivo somatic cell 
mutagenicity tests are: 
• Mammalian bone marrow chromosome 
aberration test (OECD 475) 
• Mouse spot test (OECD 484) 
• Mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus 
test (OECD 474) 
Examples of mutagenicity/genotoxicity 
tests in germ cells are: 
(a) Mutagenicity tests: 
a. Mammalian spermatogonial 
chromosome aberration test (OECD 483) 
b. Spermatid micronucleus assay 
(b) Genotoxicity tests: 
a. Sister chromatid exchange analysis in 
spermatogonia 
b. Unscheduled DNA synthesis test (UDS) 
in testicular cells 
Examples of genotoxicity tests in somatic 
cells are: 
• Liver Unscheduled DNA Synthesis 
(UDS) in vivo (OECD 486) 
• Mammalian bone marrow Sister 
Chromatid Exchanges (SCE) 
Examples of in vitro mutagenicity tests are: 
• In vitro mammalian chromosome 
aberration test (OECD 473) 
• In vitro mammalian cell gene mutation 
test (OECD 476) 
• Bacterial reverse mutation tests (OECD 
471) 
As new, scientifically validated, tests arise, 
these may also be used in the total weight of 
evidence to be considered. 
A.6 CARCINOGENICITY 
A.6.1 Definitions 
Carcinogen means a substance or a mixture 
of substances which induce cancer or 
increase its incidence. Substances and 
mixtures which have induced benign and 
malignant tumors in well-performed 
experimental studies on animals are 
considered also to be presumed or suspected 
human carcinogens unless there is strong 
evidence that the mechanism of tumor 
formation is not relevant for humans. 
Classification of a substance or mixture as 
posing a carcinogenic hazard is based on its 
inherent properties and does not provide 
information on the level of the human cancer 
risk which the use of the substance or 
mixture may represent. 
A.6.2 Classification Criteria for 
Substances 23 
A.6.2.1 For the purpose of classification 
for carcinogenicity, substances are allocated 
to one of two categories based on strength of 
evidence and additional weight of evidence 
considerations. In certain instances, route- 
specific classification may be warranted.

BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
A.6.2.2 Classification as a carcinogen is 
made on the basis of evidence from reliable 
and acceptable methods, and is intended to 
be used for substances which have an 
intrinsic property to produce such toxic 
effects. The evaluations are to be based on all 
existing data, peer-reviewed published 
studies and additional data accepted by 
regulatory agencies. 
A.6.2.3 Carcinogen classification is a one- 
step, criterion-based process that involves 
two interrelated determinations: Evaluations 
of strength of evidence and consideration of 
all other relevant information to place 
substances with human cancer potential into 
hazard categories. 
A.6.2.4 Strength of evidence involves the 
enumeration of tumors in human and animal 
studies and determination of their level of 
statistical significance. Sufficient human 
evidence demonstrates causality between 
human exposure and the development of 
cancer, whereas sufficient evidence in 
animals shows a causal relationship between 
the agent and an increased incidence of 
tumors. Limited evidence in humans is 
demonstrated by a positive association 
between exposure and cancer, but a causal 
relationship cannot be stated. Limited 
evidence in animals is provided when data 
suggest a carcinogenic effect, but are less 
than sufficient. (Guidance on consideration 
of important factors in the classification of 
carcinogenicity and a more detailed 
description of the terms ‘‘limited’’ and 
‘‘sufficient’’ have been developed by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) and are provided in Appendix F.) 
A.6.2.5 Weight of evidence: Beyond the 
determination of the strength of evidence for 
carcinogenicity, a number of other factors 
should be considered that influence the 
overall likelihood that an agent may pose a 
carcinogenic hazard in humans. The full list 
of factors that influence this determination is 
very lengthy, but some of the important ones 
are considered here. 
A.6.2.5.1 These factors can be viewed as 
either increasing or decreasing the level of 
concern for human carcinogenicity. The 
relative emphasis accorded to each factor 
depends upon the amount and coherence of 
evidence bearing on each. Generally there is 
a requirement for more complete information 
to decrease than to increase the level of 
concern. Additional considerations should be 
used in evaluating the tumor findings and the 
other factors in a case-by-case manner. 
A.6.2.5.2 Some important factors which 
may be taken into consideration, when 
assessing the overall level of concern are: 
(a) Tumor type and background incidence; 
(b) Multisite responses; 
(c) Progression of lesions to malignancy; 
(d) Reduced tumor latency; 
Additional factors which may increase or 
decrease the level of concern include: 
(e) Whether responses are in single or both 
sexes; 
(f) Whether responses are in a single 
species or several species; 
(g) Structural similarity or not to a 
substance(s) for which there is good evidence 
of carcinogenicity; 
(h) Routes of exposure;

24 It should be noted that the classification criteria 
for the GHS usually include a tiered scheme in 
which test data available on the complete mixture 
are considered as the first tier in the evaluation, 
followed by the applicable bridging principles, and 
lastly, cut-off values/concentration or additivity. 
However, this approach is not used for 
Carcinogenicity. These criteria for Carcinogenicity 
consider the cut-off levels as the primary tier and 
allow the classification to be modified only on a 
case-by-case evaluation based on available test data 
for the mixture as a whole. 
(i) Comparison of absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion between test 
animals and humans; 
(j) The possibility of a confounding effect 
of excessive toxicity at test doses; and, 
(k) Mode of action and its relevance for 
humans, such as mutagenicity, cytotoxicity 
with growth stimulation, mitogenesis, 
immunosuppression. 
Mutagenicity: It is recognized that genetic 
events are central in the overall process of 
cancer development. Therefore evidence of 
mutagenic activity in vivo may indicate that 
a substance has a potential for carcinogenic 
effects. 
A.6.2.5.3 A substance that has not been 
tested for carcinogenicity may in certain 
instances be classified in Category 1A, 
Category 1B, or Category 2 based on tumor 
data from a structural analogue together with 
substantial support from consideration of 
other important factors such as formation of 
common significant metabolites, e.g., for 
benzidine congener dyes. 
A.6.2.5.4 The classification should also 
take into consideration whether or not the 
substance is absorbed by a given route(s); or 
whether there are only local tumors at the 
site of administration for the tested route(s), 
and adequate testing by other major route(s) 
show lack of carcinogenicity. 
A.6.2.5.5 It is important that whatever is 
known of the physico-chemical, toxicokinetic 
and toxicodynamic properties of the 
substances, as well as any available relevant 
information on chemical analogues, i.e., 
structure activity relationship, is taken into 
consideration when undertaking 
classification. 
A.6.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 24 
A.6.3.1 The mixture shall be classified as 
a carcinogen when at least one ingredient has 
been classified as a Category 1 or Category 2 
carcinogen and is present at or above the 
appropriate cut-off value/concentration limit 
as shown in Table A.6.1. 
TABLE A.6.1—CUT-OFF VALUES/CONCENTRATION LIMITS OF INGREDIENTS OF A MIXTURE CLASSIFIED AS CARCINOGEN 
THAT WOULD TRIGGER CLASSIFICATION OF THE MIXTURE 
Ingredient classified as: Category 1 carcinogen 
Category 2 
carcinogen 
Category 1 carcinogen ............................................................................................................................ ≥ 0.1% ...................
Category 2 carcinogen ............................................................................................................................ ................................ ≥ 0.1% (note 1). 
Note 1: If a Category 2 carcinogen ingredient is present in the mixture at a concentration between 0.1% and 1%, information is required on 
the SDS for a product, however, a label warning is optional If a Category 2 carcinogen ingredient is present in the mixture at a concentration of ≥ 
1%, both an SDS and a label is required and the information must be included on each. 
A.6.3.2 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for the Complete Mixture 
A mixture may be classified based on the 
available test data for the mixture as a whole. 
In such cases, the test results for the mixture 
as a whole must be shown to be conclusive 
taking into account dose and other factors 
such as duration, observations and analysis 
(e.g., statistical analysis, test sensitivity) of 
carcinogenicity test systems. 
A.6.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Not Available for the Complete 
Mixture: Bridging Principles 
Where the mixture itself has not been 
tested to determine its carcinogenic hazard, 
but there are sufficient data on both the 
individual ingredients and similar tested 
mixtures to adequately characterize the 
hazards of the mixture, these data will be 
used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution; Batching; 
and Substantially similar mixtures. 
A.7 REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY 
A.7.1 Definitions and General 
Considerations 
A.7.1.1 Reproductive toxicity includes 
adverse effects on sexual function and 
fertility in adult males and females, as well 
as adverse effects on development of the 
offspring. Some reproductive toxic effects 
cannot be clearly assigned to either 
impairment of sexual function and fertility or 
to developmental toxicity. Nonetheless, 
chemicals with these effects shall be 
classified as reproductive toxicants. 
For classification purposes, the known 
induction of genetically based inheritable 
effects in the offspring is addressed in Germ 
cell mutagenicity (see A.5). 
A.7.1.2 Adverse effects on sexual 
function and fertility means any effect of 
chemicals that interferes with reproductive 
ability or sexual capacity. This includes, but 
is not limited to, alterations to the female and 
male reproductive system, adverse effects on 
onset of puberty, gamete production and 
transport, reproductive cycle normality, 
sexual behaviour, fertility, parturition, 
pregnancy outcomes, premature reproductive 
senescence, or modifications in other 
functions that are dependent on the integrity 
of the reproductive systems. 
A.7.1.3 Adverse effects on development 
of the offspring means any effect of chemicals 
which interferes with normal development of 
the conceptus either before or after birth, 
which is induced during pregnancy or results 
from parental exposure. These effects can be 
manifested at any point in the life span of the 
organism. The major manifestations of 
developmental toxicity include death of the 
developing organism, structural abnormality, 
altered growth and functional deficiency. 
A.7.1.4 Adverse effects on or via lactation 
are also included in reproductive toxicity, 
but for classification purposes, such effects 
are treated separately (see A.7.2.1). 
A.7.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
A.7.2.1 For the purpose of classification 
for reproductive toxicity, substances shall be 
classified in one of two categories in 
accordance with Figure A.7.1(a). Effects on 
sexual function and fertility, and on 
development, shall be considered. In 
addition, effects on lactation shall be 
classified in a separate hazard category in 
accordance with Figure A.7.1(b).

A.7.2.2.1 Classification is made on the 
basis of the criteria, outlined above, an 
assessment of the total weight of evidence, 
and the use of expert judgment. Classification

specific property to produce an adverse effect 
on reproduction and substances should not 
be so classified if such an effect is produced 
solely as a non-specific secondary 
consequence of other toxic effects. 
A.7.2.2.2 In the evaluation of toxic effects 
on the developing offspring, it is important 
to consider the possible influence of maternal 
toxicity. 
A.7.2.2.3 For human evidence to provide 
the primary basis for a Category 1A 
classification there must be reliable evidence 
of an adverse effect on reproduction in 
humans. Evidence used for classification 
shall be from well conducted 
epidemiological studies, if available, which 
include the use of appropriate controls, 
balanced assessment, and due consideration 
of bias or confounding factors. Less rigorous 
data from studies in humans may be 
sufficient for a Category 1A classification if 
supplemented with adequate data from 
studies in experimental animals, but 
classification in Category 1B may also be 
considered. 
A.7.2.3 Weight of Evidence 
A.7.2.3.1 Classification as a reproductive 
toxicant is made on the basis of an 
assessment of the total weight of evidence 
using expert judgment. This means that all 
available information that bears on the 
determination of reproductive toxicity is 
considered together. Included is information 
such as epidemiological studies and case 
reports in humans and specific reproduction 
studies along with sub-chronic, chronic and 
special study results in animals that provide 
relevant information regarding toxicity to 
reproductive and related endocrine organs. 
Evaluation of substances chemically related 
to the material under study may also be 
included, particularly when information on 
the material is scarce. The weight given to 
the available evidence will be influenced by 
factors such as the quality of the studies, 
consistency of results, nature and severity of 
effects, level of statistical significance for 
intergroup differences, number of endpoints 
affected, relevance of route of administration 
to humans and freedom from bias. Both 
positive and negative results are assembled 
together into a weight of evidence 
determination. However, a single, positive 
study performed according to good scientific 
principles and with statistically or 
biologically significant positive results may 
justify classification (see also A.7.2.2.3). 
A.7.2.3.2 Toxicokinetic studies in 
animals and humans, site of action and 
mechanism or mode of action study results 
may provide relevant information, which 
could reduce or increase concerns about the 
hazard to human health. If it is conclusively 
demonstrated that the clearly identified 
mechanism or mode of action has no 
relevance for humans or when the 
toxicokinetic differences are so marked that 
it is certain that the hazardous property will 
not be expressed in humans then a chemical 
which produces an adverse effect on 
reproduction in experimental animals should 
not be classified. 
A.7.2.3.3 In some reproductive toxicity 
studies in experimental animals the only 
effects recorded may be considered of low or 
minimal toxicological significance and 
classification may not necessarily be the 
outcome. These effects include, for example, 
small changes in semen parameters or in the 
incidence of spontaneous defects in the fetus, 
small changes in the proportions of common 
fetal variants such as are observed in skeletal 
examinations, or in fetal weights, or small 
differences in postnatal developmental 
assessments. 
A.7.2.3.4 Data from animal studies shall 
provide sufficient evidence of specific 
reproductive toxicity in the absence of other 
systemic toxic effects. However, if 
developmental toxicity occurs together with 
other toxic effects in the dam (mother), the 
potential influence of the generalized adverse 
effects should be assessed to the extent 
possible. The preferred approach is to 
consider adverse effects in the embryo/fetus 
first, and then evaluate maternal toxicity, 
along with any other factors which are likely 
to have influenced these effects, as part of the 
weight of evidence. In general, 
developmental effects that are observed at 
maternally toxic doses should not be 
automatically discounted. Discounting 
developmental effects that are observed at 
maternally toxic doses can only be done on 
a case-by-case basis when a causal 
relationship is established or refuted. 
A.7.2.3.5 If appropriate information is 
available it is important to try to determine 
whether developmental toxicity is due to a 
specific maternally mediated mechanism or 
to a non-specific secondary mechanism, like 
maternal stress and the disruption of 
homeostasis. Generally, the presence of 
maternal toxicity should not be used to 
negate findings of embryo/fetal effects, unless 
it can be clearly demonstrated that the effects 
are secondary non-specific effects. This is 
especially the case when the effects in the 
offspring are significant, e.g., irreversible 
effects such as structural malformations. In 
some situations it is reasonable to assume 
that reproductive toxicity is due to a 
secondary consequence of maternal toxicity 
and discount the effects, for example if the 
chemical is so toxic that dams fail to thrive 
and there is severe inanition; they are 
incapable of nursing pups; or they are 
prostrate or dying. 
A.7.2.4 Maternal Toxicity 
A.7.2.4.1 Development of the offspring 
throughout gestation and during the early 
postnatal stages can be influenced by toxic 
effects in the mother either through non- 
specific mechanisms related to stress and the 
disruption of maternal homeostasis, or by 
specific maternally-mediated mechanisms. 
So, in the interpretation of the developmental 
outcome to decide classification for 
developmental effects it is important to 
consider the possible influence of maternal 
toxicity. This is a complex issue because of 
uncertainties surrounding the relationship 
between maternal toxicity and 
developmental outcome. Expert judgment 
and a weight of evidence approach, using all 
available studies, shall be used to determine 
the degree of influence to be attributed to 
maternal toxicity when interpreting the 
criteria for classification for developmental 
effects. The adverse effects in the embryo/ 
fetus shall be first considered, and then 
maternal toxicity, along with any other 
factors which are likely to have influenced 
these effects, as weight of evidence, to help 
reach a conclusion about classification. 
A.7.2.4.2 Based on pragmatic observation, 
it is believed that maternal toxicity may, 
depending on severity, influence 
development via non-specific secondary 
mechanisms, producing effects such as 
depressed fetal weight, retarded ossification, 
and possibly resorptions and certain 
malformations in some strains of certain 
species. However, the limited numbers of 
studies which have investigated the 
relationship between developmental effects 
and general maternal toxicity have failed to 
demonstrate a consistent, reproducible 
relationship across species. Developmental 
effects which occur even in the presence of 
maternal toxicity are considered to be 
evidence of developmental toxicity, unless it 
can be unequivocally demonstrated on a case 
by case basis that the developmental effects 
are secondary to maternal toxicity. Moreover, 
classification shall be considered where there 
is a significant toxic effect in the offspring, 
e.g., irreversible effects such as structural 
malformations, embryo/fetal lethality, or 
significant post-natal functional deficiencies. 
A.7.2.4.3 Classification shall not 
automatically be discounted for chemicals 
that produce developmental toxicity only in 
association with maternal toxicity, even if a 
specific maternally-mediated mechanism has 
been demonstrated. In such a case, 
classification in Category 2 may be 
considered more appropriate than Category 1. 
However, when a chemical is so toxic that 
maternal death or severe inanition results, or 
the dams (mothers) are prostrate and 
incapable of nursing the pups, it is 
reasonable to assume that developmental 
toxicity is produced solely as a secondary 
consequence of maternal toxicity and 
discount the developmental effects. 
Classification is not necessarily the outcome 
in the case of minor developmental changes, 
e.g., a small reduction in fetal/pup body 
weight or retardation of ossification when 
seen in association with maternal toxicity. 
A.7.2.4.4 Some of the endpoints used to 
assess maternal toxicity are provided below. 
Data on these endpoints, if available, shall be 
evaluated in light of their statistical or 
biological significance and dose-response 
relationship. 
(a) Maternal mortality: An increased 
incidence of mortality among the treated 
dams over the controls shall be considered 
evidence of maternal toxicity if the increase 
occurs in a dose-related manner and can be 
attributed to the systemic toxicity of the test 
material. Maternal mortality greater than 
10% is considered excessive and the data for 
that dose level shall not normally be 
considered to need further evaluation. 
(b) Mating index (Number of animals with 
seminal plugs or sperm/Number of mated × 
100) 
(c) Fertility index (Number of animals with 
implants/Number of matings × 100) 
(d) Gestation length (If allowed to deliver) 
(e) Body weight and body weight change: 
Consideration of the maternal body weight 
change and/or adjusted (corrected) maternal 
body weight shall be included in the 
evaluation of maternal toxicity whenever

25 It should be noted that the classification criteria 
for the GHS usually include a tiered scheme in 
which test data available on the complete mixture 
are considered as the first tier in the evaluation, 
followed by the applicable bridging principles, and 
lastly, cut-off values/concentration or additivity. 
However, this approach is not used for 
Reproductive Toxicity. These criteria for 
Reproductive Toxicity consider the cut-off levels as 
the primary tier and allow the classification to be 
modified only on a case-by-case evaluation based 
on available test data for the mixture as a whole. 
such data are available. The calculation of an 
adjusted (corrected) mean maternal body 
weight change, which is the difference 
between the initial and terminal body weight 
minus the gravid uterine weight (or 
alternatively, the sum of the weights of the 
fetuses), may indicate whether the effect is 
maternal or intrauterine. In rabbits, the body 
weight gain may not be useful indicators of 
maternal toxicity because of normal 
fluctuations in body weight during 
pregnancy. 
(f) Food and water consumption (if 
relevant): The observation of a significant 
decrease in the average food or water 
consumption in treated dams (mothers) 
compared to the control group may be useful 
in evaluating maternal toxicity, particularly 
when the test material is administered in the 
diet or drinking water. Changes in food or 
water consumption must be evaluated in 
conjunction with maternal body weights 
when determining if the effects noted are 
reflective of maternal toxicity or more 
simply, unpalatability of the test material in 
feed or water. 
(g) Clinical evaluations (including clinical 
signs, markers, and hematology and clinical 
chemistry studies): The observation of 
increased incidence of significant clinical 
signs of toxicity in treated dams (mothers) 
relative to the control group is useful in 
evaluating maternal toxicity. If this is to be 
used as the basis for the assessment of 
maternal toxicity, the types, incidence, 
degree and duration of clinical signs shall be 
reported in the study. Clinical signs of 
maternal intoxication include, but are not 
limited to: coma, prostration, hyperactivity, 
loss of righting reflex, ataxia, or labored 
breathing. 
(h) Post-mortem data: Increased incidence 
and/or severity of post-mortem findings may 
be indicative of maternal toxicity. This can 
include gross or microscopic pathological 
findings or organ weight data, including 
absolute organ weight, organ-to-body weight 
ratio, or organ-to-brain weight ratio. When 
supported by findings of adverse 
histopathological effects in the affected 
organ(s), the observation of a significant 
change in the average weight of suspected 
target organ(s) of treated dams (mothers), 
compared to those in the control group, may 
be considered evidence of maternal toxicity. 
A.7.2.5 Animal and Experimental Data 
A.7.2.5.1 A number of scientifically 
validated test methods are available, 
including methods for developmental 
toxicity testing (e.g., OECD Test Guideline 
414, ICH Guideline S5A, 1993), methods for 
peri- and post-natal toxicity testing (e.g., ICH 
S5B, 1995), and methods for one or two- 
generation toxicity testing (e.g., OECD Test 
Guidelines 415, 416) 
A.7.2.5.2 Results obtained from screening 
tests (e.g., OECD Guidelines 421— 
Reproduction/Developmental Toxicity 
Screening Test, and 422—Combined 
Repeated Dose Toxicity Study with 
Reproduction/Development Toxicity 
Screening Test) can also be used to justify 
classification, although the quality of this 
evidence is less reliable than that obtained 
through full studies. 
A.7.2.5.3 Adverse effects or changes, seen 
in short- or long-term repeated dose toxicity 
studies, which are judged likely to impair 
reproductive function and which occur in the 
absence of significant generalized toxicity, 
may be used as a basis for classification, e.g., 
histopathological changes in the gonads. 
A.7.2.5.4 Evidence from in vitro assays, 
or non-mammalian tests, and from analogous 
substances using structure-activity 
relationship (SAR), can contribute to the 
procedure for classification. In all cases of 
this nature, expert judgment must be used to 
assess the adequacy of the data. Inadequate 
data should not be used as a primary support 
for classification. 
A.7.2.5.5 It is preferable that animal 
studies are conducted using appropriate 
routes of administration which relate to the 
potential route of human exposure. However, 
in practice, reproductive toxicity studies are 
commonly conducted using the oral route, 
and such studies will normally be suitable 
for evaluating the hazardous properties of the 
substance with respect to reproductive 
toxicity. However, if it can be conclusively 
demonstrated that the clearly identified 
mechanism or mode of action has no 
relevance for humans or when the 
toxicokinetic differences are so marked that 
it is certain that the hazardous property will 
not be expressed in humans then a substance 
which produces an adverse effect on 
reproduction in experimental animals should 
not be classified. 
A.7.2.5.6 Studies involving routes of 
administration such as intravenous or 
intraperitoneal injection, which may result in 
exposure of the reproductive organs to 
unrealistically high levels of the test 
substance, or elicit local damage to the 
reproductive organs, e.g., by irritation, must 
be interpreted with extreme caution and on 
their own are not normally the basis for 
classification. 
A.7.2.5.7 There is general agreement 
about the concept of a limit dose, above 
which the production of an adverse effect 
may be considered to be outside the criteria 
which lead to classification. Some test 
guidelines specify a limit dose, other test 
guidelines qualify the limit dose with a 
statement that higher doses may be necessary 
if anticipated human exposure is sufficiently 
high that an adequate margin of exposure 
would not be achieved. Also, due to species 
differences in toxicokinetics, establishing a 
specific limit dose may not be adequate for 
situations where humans are more sensitive 
than the animal model. 
A.7.2.5.8 In principle, adverse effects on 
reproduction seen only at very high dose 
levels in animal studies (for example doses 
that induce prostration, severe inappetence, 
excessive mortality) do not normally lead to 
classification, unless other information is 
available, for example, toxicokinetics 
information indicating that humans may be 
more susceptible than animals, to suggest 
that classification is appropriate. 
A.7.2.5.9 However, specification of the 
actual ‘‘limit dose’’ will depend upon the test 
method that has been employed to provide 
the test results. 
A.7.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 25 
A.7.3.1 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for All Ingredients or 
Only for Some Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.7.3.1.1 The mixture shall be classified 
as a reproductive toxicant when at least one 
ingredient has been classified as a Category 
1 or Category 2 reproductive toxicant and is 
present at or above the appropriate cut-off 
value/concentration limit specified in Table 
A.7.1 for Category 1 and 2, respectively. 
A.7.3.1.2 The mixture shall be classified 
for effects on or via lactation when at least 
one ingredient has been classified for effects 
on or via lactation and is present at or above 
the appropriate cut-off value/concentration 
limit specified in Table A.7.1 for the 
additional category for effects on or via 
lactation.

A.7.3.2 Classification of mixtures when 
data are available for the complete mixture 
Available test data for the mixture as a 
whole may be used for classification on a 
case-by-case basis. In such cases, the test 
results for the mixture as a whole must be 
shown to be conclusive taking into account 
dose and other factors such as duration, 
observations and analysis (e.g., statistical 
analysis, test sensitivity) of reproduction test 
systems. 
A.7.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Not Available for the Complete 
Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.7.3.3.1 Where the mixture itself has not 
been tested to determine its reproductive 
toxicity, but there are sufficient data on both 
the individual ingredients and similar tested 
mixtures to adequately characterize the 
hazards of the mixture, these data shall be 
used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution, Batching, 
and Substantially similar mixtures. 
A.8 SPECIFIC TARGET ORGAN TOXICITY 
SINGLE EXPOSURE 
A.8.1 Definitions and General 
Considerations 
A.8.1.1 Specific target organ toxicity— 
single exposure, (STOT–SE) means specific, 
non-lethal target organ toxicity arising from 
a single exposure to a chemical. All 
significant health effects that can impair 
function, both reversible and irreversible, 
immediate and/or delayed and not 
specifically addressed in A.1 to A.7 and A.10 
of this Appendix are included. Specific target 
organ toxicity following repeated exposure is 
classified in accordance with SPECIFIC 
TARGET ORGAN TOXICITY—REPEATED 
EXPOSURE (A.9 of this Appendix) and is 
therefore not included here. 
A.8.1.2 Classification identifies the 
chemical as being a specific target organ 
toxicant and, as such, it presents a potential 
for adverse health effects in people who are 
exposed to it. 
A.8.1.3 The adverse health effects 
produced by a single exposure include 
consistent and identifiable toxic effects in 
humans; or, in experimental animals, 
toxicologically significant changes which 
have affected the function or morphology of 
a tissue/organ, or have produced serious 
changes to the biochemistry or hematology of 
the organism, and these changes are relevant 
for human health. Human data is the primary 
source of evidence for this hazard class. 
A.8.1.4 Assessment shall take into 
consideration not only significant changes in 
a single organ or biological system but also 
generalized changes of a less severe nature 
involving several organs. 
A.8.1.5 Specific target organ toxicity can 
occur by any route that is relevant for 
humans, i.e., principally oral, dermal or 
inhalation. 
A.8.1.6 The classification criteria for 
specific organ systemic toxicity single 
exposure are organized as criteria for 
substances Categories 1 and 2 (see A.8.2.1), 
criteria for substances Category 3 (see 
A.8.2.2) and criteria for mixtures (see A.8.3). 
See also Figure A.8.1. 
A.8.2 Classification Criteria for Substances 
A.8.2.1 Substances of Category 1 and 
Category 2 
A.8.2.1.1 Substances shall be classified 
for immediate or delayed effects separately, 
by the use of expert judgment on the basis 
of the weight of all evidence available, 
including the use of recommended guidance 
values (see A.8.2.1.9). Substances shall then 
be classified in Category 1 or 2, depending 
upon the nature and severity of the effect(s) 
observed, in accordance with Figure A.8.1.

A.8.2.1.2 The relevant route(s) of 
exposure by which the classified substance 
produces damage shall be identified. 
A.8.2.1.3 Classification is determined by 
expert judgment, on the basis of the weight 
of all evidence available including the 
guidance presented below. 
A.8.2.1.4 Weight of evidence of all data, 
including human incidents, epidemiology, 
and studies conducted in experimental 
animals is used to substantiate specific target 
organ toxic effects that merit classification. 
A.8.2.1.5 The information required to 
evaluate specific target organ toxicity comes 
either from single exposure in humans, e.g., 
exposure at home, in the workplace or 
environmentally, or from studies conducted 
in experimental animals. The standard 
animal studies in rats or mice that provide 
this information are acute toxicity studies 
which can include clinical observations and 
detailed macroscopic and microscopic 
examination to enable the toxic effects on 
target tissues/organs to be identified. Results 
of acute toxicity studies conducted in other 
species may also provide relevant 
information. 
A.8.2.1.6 In exceptional cases, based on 
expert judgment, it may be appropriate to 
place certain substances with human 
evidence of target organ toxicity in Category 
2: (a) when the weight of human evidence is 
not sufficiently convincing to warrant 
Category 1 classification, and/or (b) based on 
the nature and severity of effects. Dose/ 
concentration levels in humans shall not be 
considered in the classification and any 
available evidence from animal studies shall 
be consistent with the Category 2 
classification. In other words, if there are also 
animal data available on the substance that 
warrant Category 1 classification, the 
chemical shall be classified as Category 1. 
A.8.2.1.7 Effects considered to support 
classification for Category 1 and 2 
A.8.2.1.7.1 Classification is supported by 
evidence associating single exposure to the 
substance with a consistent and identifiable 
toxic effect. 
A.8.2.1.7.2 Evidence from human 
experience/incidents is usually restricted to 
reports of adverse health consequences, often 
with uncertainty about exposure conditions, 
and may not provide the scientific detail that 
can be obtained from well-conducted studies 
in experimental animals. 
A.8.2.1.7.3 Evidence from appropriate 
studies in experimental animals can furnish 
much more detail, in the form of clinical 
observations, and macroscopic and 
microscopic pathological examination and 
this can often reveal hazards that may not be 
life-threatening but could indicate functional 
impairment. Consequently all available 
evidence, and evidence relevance to human 
health, must be taken into consideration in 
the classification process. Relevant toxic 
effects in humans and/or animals include, 
but are not limited to: 
(a) Morbidity resulting from single 
exposure; 
(b) Significant functional changes, more 
than transient in nature, in the respiratory 
system, central or peripheral nervous 
systems, other organs or other organ systems, 
including signs of central nervous system 
depression and effects on special senses (e.g., 
sight, hearing and sense of smell); 
(c) Any consistent and significant adverse 
change in clinical biochemistry, hematology, 
or urinalysis parameters;

(d) Significant organ damage that may be 
noted at necropsy and/or subsequently seen 
or confirmed at microscopic examination; 
(e) Multi-focal or diffuse necrosis, fibrosis 
or granuloma formation in vital organs with 
regenerative capacity; 
(f) Morphological changes that are 
potentially reversible but provide clear 
evidence of marked organ dysfunction; and, 
(g) Evidence of appreciable cell death 
(including cell degeneration and reduced cell 
number) in vital organs incapable of 
regeneration. 
A.8.2.1.8 Effects considered not to 
support classification for Category 1 and 2 
Effects may be seen in humans and/or 
animals that do not justify classification. 
Such effects include, but are not limited to: 
(a) Clinical observations or small changes 
in bodyweight gain, food consumption or 
water intake that may have some 
toxicological importance but that do not, by 
themselves, indicate ‘‘significant’’ toxicity; 
(b) Small changes in clinical biochemistry, 
hematology or urinalysis parameters and/or 
transient effects, when such changes or 
effects are of doubtful or of minimal 
toxicological importance; 
(c) Changes in organ weights with no 
evidence of organ dysfunction; 
(d) Adaptive responses that are not 
considered toxicologically relevant; and, 
(e) Substance-induced species-specific 
mechanisms of toxicity, i.e., demonstrated 
with reasonable certainty to be not relevant 
for human health, shall not justify 
classification. 
A.8.2.1.9 Guidance values to assist with 
classification based on the results obtained 
from studies conducted in experimental 
animals for Category 1 and 2 
A.8.2.1.9.1 In order to help reach a 
decision about whether a substance shall be 
classified or not, and to what degree it shall 
be classified (Category 1 vs. Category 2), 
dose/concentration ‘‘guidance values’’ are 
provided for consideration of the dose/ 
concentration which has been shown to 
produce significant health effects. The 
principal argument for proposing such 
guidance values is that all chemicals are 
potentially toxic and there has to be a 
reasonable dose/concentration above which a 
degree of toxic effect is acknowledged. 
A.8.2.1.9.2 Thus, in animal studies, when 
significant toxic effects are observed that 
indicate classification, consideration of the 
dose/concentration at which these effects 
were seen, in relation to the suggested 
guidance values, provides useful information 
to help assess the need to classify (since the 
toxic effects are a consequence of the 
hazardous property(ies) and also the dose/ 
concentration). 
A.8.2.1.9.3 The guidance value (C) ranges 
for single-dose exposure which has produced 
a significant non-lethal toxic effect are those 
applicable to acute toxicity testing, as 
indicated in Table A.8.1. 
BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
A.8.2.1.9.4 The guidance values and 
ranges mentioned in Table A.8.1 are intended 
only for guidance purposes, i.e., to be used 
as part of the weight of evidence approach, 
and to assist with decisions about 
classification. They are not intended as strict 
demarcation values. Guidance values are not 
provided for Category 3 since this 
classification is primarily based on human 
data; animal data may be included in the 
weight of evidence evaluation. 
A.8.2.1.9.5 Thus, it is feasible that a 
specific profile of toxicity occurs at a dose/ 
concentration below the guidance value, e.g., 
< 2000 mg/kg body weight by the oral route, 
however the nature of the effect may result 
in the decision not to classify. Conversely, a 
specific profile of toxicity may be seen in 
animal studies occurring at above a guidance 
value, e.g., ≥ 2000 mg/kg body weight by the 
oral route, and in addition there is 
supplementary information from other 
sources, e.g., other single dose studies, or 
human case experience, which supports a 
conclusion that, in view of the weight of 
evidence, classification is the prudent action 
to take. 
A.8.2.1.10 Other Considerations 
A.8.2.1.10.1 When a substance is 
characterized only by use of animal data 
(typical of new substances, but also true for 
many existing substances), the classification 
process includes reference to dose/ 
concentration guidance values as one of the 
elements that contribute to the weight of 
evidence approach. 
A.8.2.1.10.2 When well-substantiated 
human data are available showing a specific 
target organ toxic effect that can be reliably 
attributed to single exposure to a substance, 
the substance shall be classified. Positive 
human data, regardless of probable dose, 
predominates over animal data. Thus, if a 
substance is unclassified because specific 
target organ toxicity observed was considered 
not relevant or significant to humans, if 
subsequent human incident data become 
available showing a specific target organ 
toxic effect, the substance shall be classified. 
A.8.2.1.10.3 A substance that has not 
been tested for specific target organ toxicity 
shall, where appropriate, be classified on the 
basis of data from a validated structure 
activity relationship and expert judgment- 
based extrapolation from a structural 
analogue that has previously been classified 
together with substantial support from 
consideration of other important factors such 
as formation of common significant 
metabolites. 
A.8.2.2 Substances of Category 3 
A.8.2.2.1 Criteria for Respiratory Tract 
Irritation 
The criteria for classifying substances as 
Category 3 for respiratory tract irritation are: 
(a) Respiratory irritant effects 
(characterized by localized redness, edema, 
pruritis and/or pain) that impair function 
with symptoms such as cough, pain, choking, 
and breathing difficulties are included. It is 
recognized that this evaluation is based 
primarily on human data; 
(b) Subjective human observations 
supported by objective measurements of clear 
respiratory tract irritation (RTI) (e.g., 
electrophysiological responses, biomarkers of 
inflammation in nasal or bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluids); 
(c) The symptoms observed in humans 
shall also be typical of those that would be 
produced in the exposed population rather 
than being an isolated idiosyncratic reaction 
or response triggered only in individuals 
with hypersensitive airways. Ambiguous 
reports simply of ‘‘irritation’’ should be 
excluded as this term is commonly used to 
describe a wide range of sensations including 
those such as smell, unpleasant taste, a 
tickling sensation, and dryness, which are 
outside the scope of classification for 
respiratory track irritation;

(d) There are currently no validated animal 
tests that deal specifically with RTI; however, 
useful information may be obtained from the 
single and repeated inhalation toxicity tests. 
For example, animal studies may provide 
useful information in terms of clinical signs 
of toxicity (dyspnoea, rhinitis etc) and 
histopathology (e.g., hyperemia, edema, 
minimal inflammation, thickened mucous 
layer) which are reversible and may be 
reflective of the characteristic clinical 
symptoms described above. Such animal 
studies can be used as part of weight of 
evidence evaluation; and, 
(e) This special classification will occur 
only when more severe organ effects 
including the respiratory system are not 
observed as those effects would require a 
higher classification. 
A.8.2.2.2 Criteria for narcotic effects 
The criteria for classifying substances in 
Category 3 for narcotic effects are: 
(a) Central nervous system depression 
including narcotic effects in humans such as 
drowsiness, narcosis, reduced alertness, loss 
of reflexes, lack of coordination, and vertigo 
are included. These effects can also be 
manifested as severe headache or nausea, and 
can lead to reduced judgment, dizziness, 
irritability, fatigue, impaired memory 
function, deficits in perception and 
coordination, reaction time, or sleepiness; 
and, 
(b) Narcotic effects observed in animal 
studies may include lethargy, lack of 
coordination righting reflex, narcosis, and 
ataxia. If these effects are not transient in 
nature, then they shall be considered for 
classification as Category 1 or 2. 
A.8.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 
A.8.3.1 Mixtures are classified using the 
same criteria as for substances, or 
alternatively as described below. As with 
substances, mixtures may be classified for 
specific target organ toxicity following single 
exposure, repeated exposure, or both. 
A.8.3.2 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for the Complete Mixture 
When reliable and good quality evidence 
from human experience or appropriate 
studies in experimental animals, as described 
in the criteria for substances, is available for 
the mixture, then the mixture shall be 
classified by weight of evidence evaluation of 
this data. Care shall be exercised in 
evaluating data on mixtures, that the dose, 
duration, observation or analysis, do not 
render the results inconclusive. 
A.8.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Not Available for the Complete 
Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.8.3.3.1 Where the mixture itself has not 
been tested to determine its specific target 
organ toxicity, but there are sufficient data on 
both the individual ingredients and similar 
tested mixtures to adequately characterize 
the hazards of the mixture, these data shall 
be used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution, Batching, 
Concentration of mixtures, Interpolation 
within one toxicity category, Substantially 
similar mixtures, or Aerosols. 
A.8.3.4 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for All Ingredients or 
Only for Some Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.8.3.4.1 Where there is no reliable 
evidence or test data for the specific mixture 
itself, and the bridging principles cannot be 
used to enable classification, then 
classification of the mixture is based on the 
classification of the ingredient substances. In 
this case, the mixture shall be classified as 
a specific target organ toxicant (specific organ 
specified), following single exposure, 
repeated exposure, or both when at least one 
ingredient has been classified as a Category 
1 or Category 2 specific target organ toxicant 
and is present at or above the appropriate 
cut-off value/concentration limit specified in 
Table A.8.2 for Categories 1 and 2, 
respectively, in accordance with the 
principles of A.0.2.1 in this Appendix. 
TABLE A.8.2—CUT-OFF VALUES/CONCENTRATION LIMITS OF INGREDIENTS OF A MIXTURE CLASSIFIED AS A SPECIFIC 
TARGET ORGAN TOXICANT THAT WOULD TRIGGER CLASSIFICATION OF THE MIXTURE AS CATEGORY 1 OR 2 
Ingredient classified as: 
Cut-off values/concentration limits 
triggering classification of a mixture as: 
Category 1 Category 2 
Category 1 Target organ toxicant ............................................................................................................ ≥ 1.0%.
Category 2 Target organ toxicant ............................................................................................................ ................................ ≥ 1.0% 
A.8.3.4.2 These cut-off values and 
consequent classifications shall be applied 
equally and appropriately to both single- and 
repeated-dose target organ toxicants. 
A.8.3.4.3 Mixtures shall be classified for 
either or both single and repeated dose 
toxicity independently. 
A.8.3.4.4 Care shall be exercised when 
toxicants affecting more than one organ 
system are combined that the potentiation or 
synergistic interactions are considered, 
because certain substances can cause target 
organ toxicity at < 1% concentration when 
other ingredients in the mixture are known 
to potentiate its toxic effect. See A.0.2.1. 
A.8.3.4.5 Care shall be exercised when 
extrapolating the toxicity of a mixture that 
contains Category 3 ingredient(s). A cut-off 
value/concentration limit of 20%, considered 
as an additive of all Category 3 ingredients 
for each hazard endpoint, is appropriate; 
however, this cut-off value/concentration 
limit may be higher or lower depending on 
the Category 3 ingredient(s) involved and the 
fact that some effects such as respiratory tract 
irritation may not occur below a certain 
concentration while other effects such as 
narcotic effects may occur below this 20% 
value. Expert judgment shall be exercised. 
Respiratory tract irritation and narcotic 
effects are to be evaluated separately in 
accordance with the criteria given in A.8.2.2. 
When conducting classifications for these 
hazards, the contribution of each ingredient 
should be considered additive, unless there 
is evidence that the effects are not additive. 
A.9 SPECIFIC TARGET ORGAN 
TOXICITY REPEATED OR PROLONGED 
EXPOSURE 
A.9.1 Definitions and General 
Considerations 
A.9.1.1 Specific target organ toxicity— 
repeated exposure (STOT-RE) means specific 
target organ toxicity arising from repeated 
exposure to a substance or mixture. All 
significant health effects that can impair 
function, both reversible and irreversible, 
immediate and/or delayed and not 
specifically addressed in A.1 to A.7 and A.10 
of this Appendix are included. Specific target 
organ toxicity following a single-event 
exposure is classified in accordance with 
SPECIFIC TARGET ORGAN TOXICITY— 
SINGLE EXPOSURE (A.8 of this Appendix) 
and is therefore not included here. 
A.9.1.2 Classification identifies the 
substance or mixture as being a specific 
target organ toxicant and, as such, it may 
present a potential for adverse health effects 
in people who are exposed to it. 
A.9.1.3 These adverse health effects 
produced by repeated exposure include 
consistent and identifiable toxic effects in 
humans, or, in experimental animals, 
toxicologically significant changes which 
have affected the function or morphology of 
a tissue/organ, or have produced serious 
changes to the biochemistry or hematology of 
the organism and these changes are relevant 
for human health. Human data will be the 
primary source of evidence for this hazard 
class. 
A.9.1.4 Assessment shall take into 
consideration not only significant changes in 
a single organ or biological system but also 
generalized changes of a less severe nature 
involving several organs. 
A.9.1.5 Specific target organ toxicity can 
occur by any route that is relevant for 
humans, i.e., principally oral, dermal or 
inhalation. 
A.9.2 Classification Criteria for 
Substances 
A.9.2.1 Substances shall be classified as 
STOT—RE by expert judgment on the basis 
of the weight of all evidence available,

including the use of recommended guidance 
values which take into account the duration 
of exposure and the dose/concentration 
which produced the effect(s), (see A.9.2.9). 
Substances shall be placed in one of two 
categories, depending upon the nature and 
severity of the effect(s) observed, in 
accordance with Figure A.9.1. 
BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
A.9.2.2 The relevant route of exposure by 
which the classified substance produces 
damage shall be identified. 
A.9.2.3 Classification is determined by 
expert judgment, on the basis of the weight 
of all evidence available including the 
guidance presented below. 
A.9.2.4 Weight of evidence of all data, 
including human incidence, epidemiology, 
and studies conducted in experimental 
animals, is used to substantiate specific target 
organ toxic effects that merit classification. 
A.9.2.5 The information required to 
evaluate specific target organ toxicity comes 
either from repeated exposure in humans, 
e.g., exposure at home, in the workplace or 
environmentally, or from studies conducted 
in experimental animals. The standard 
animal studies in rats or mice that provide 
this information are 28 day, 90 day or 
lifetime studies (up to 2 years) that include 
hematological, clinico-chemical and detailed 
macroscopic and microscopic examination to 
enable the toxic effects on target tissues/ 
organs to be identified. Data from repeat dose 
studies performed in other species may also 
be used. Other long-term exposure studies, 
e.g., for carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity or 
reproductive toxicity, may also provide 
evidence of specific target organ toxicity that 
could be used in the assessment of 
classification. 
A.9.2.6 In exceptional cases, based on 
expert judgment, it may be appropriate to 
place certain substances with human 
evidence of specific target organ toxicity in 
Category 2: (a) when the weight of human 
evidence is not sufficiently convincing to 
warrant Category 1 classification, and/or (b) 
based on the nature and severity of effects. 
Dose/concentration levels in humans shall 
not be considered in the classification and 
any available evidence from animal studies 
shall be consistent with the Category 2 
classification. In other words, if there are also 
animal data available on the substance that 
warrant Category 1 classification, the 
substance shall be classified as Category 1. 
A.9.2.7 Effects considered to support 
classification 
A.9.2.7.1 Classification is supported by 
reliable evidence associating repeated 
exposure to the substance with a consistent 
and identifiable toxic effect. 
A.9.2.7.2 Evidence from human 
experience/incidence is usually restricted to 
reports of adverse health consequences, often 
with uncertainty about exposure conditions, 
and may not provide the scientific detail that 
can be obtained from well-conducted studies 
in experimental animals. 
A.9.2.7.3 Evidence from appropriate 
studies in experimental animals can furnish 
much more detail, in the form of clinical 
observations, hematology, clinical chemistry, 
macroscopic and microscopic pathological 
examination and this can often reveal 
hazards that may not be life-threatening but 
could indicate functional impairment. 
Consequently all available evidence, and 
relevance to human health, must be taken 
into consideration in the classification 
process. Relevant toxic effects in humans 
and/or animals include, but are not limited 
to: 
(a) Morbidity or death resulting from 
repeated or long-term exposure. Morbidity or 
death may result from repeated exposure, 
even to relatively low doses/concentrations, 
due to bioaccumulation of the substance or 
its metabolites, or due to the overwhelming 
of the de-toxification process by repeated 
exposure; 
(b) Significant functional changes in the 
central or peripheral nervous systems or 
other organ systems, including signs of 
central nervous system depression and

effects on special senses (e.g., sight, hearing 
and sense of smell); 
(c) Any consistent and significant adverse 
change in clinical biochemistry, hematology, 
or urinalysis parameters; 
(d) Significant organ damage that may be 
noted at necropsy and/or subsequently seen 
or confirmed at microscopic examination; 
(e) Multi-focal or diffuse necrosis, fibrosis 
or granuloma formation in vital organs with 
regenerative capacity; 
(f) Morphological changes that are 
potentially reversible but provide clear 
evidence of marked organ dysfunction (e.g., 
severe fatty change in the liver); and, 
(g) Evidence of appreciable cell death 
(including cell degeneration and reduced cell 
number) in vital organs incapable of 
regeneration. 
A.9.2.8 Effects Considered Not to Support 
Classification 
Effects may be seen in humans and/or 
animals that do not justify classification. 
Such effects include, but are not limited to: 
(a) Clinical observations or small changes 
in bodyweight gain, food consumption or 
water intake that may have some 
toxicological importance but that do not, by 
themselves, indicate ‘‘significant’’ toxicity; 
(b) Small changes in clinical biochemistry, 
hematology or urinalysis parameters and/or 
transient effects, when such changes or 
effects are of doubtful or of minimal 
toxicological importance; 
(c) Changes in organ weights with no 
evidence of organ dysfunction; 
(d) Adaptive responses that are not 
considered toxicologically relevant; 
(e) Substance-induced species-specific 
mechanisms of toxicity, i.e., demonstrated 
with reasonable certainty to be not relevant 
for human health, shall not justify 
classification. 
A.9.2.9 Guidance values to assist with 
classification based on the results obtained 
from studies conducted in experimental 
animals 
A.9.2.9.1 In studies conducted in 
experimental animals, reliance on 
observation of effects alone, without 
reference to the duration of experimental 
exposure and dose/concentration, omits a 
fundamental concept of toxicology, i.e., all 
substances are potentially toxic, and what 
determines the toxicity is a function of the 
dose/concentration and the duration of 
exposure. In most studies conducted in 
experimental animals the test guidelines use 
an upper limit dose value. 
A.9.2.9.2 In order to help reach a decision 
about whether a substance shall be classified 
or not, and to what degree it shall be 
classified (Category 1 vs. Category 2), dose/ 
concentration ‘‘guidance values’’ are 
provided in Table A.9.1 for consideration of 
the dose/concentration which has been 
shown to produce significant health effects. 
The principal argument for proposing such 
guidance values is that all chemicals are 
potentially toxic and there has to be a 
reasonable dose/concentration above which a 
degree of toxic effect is acknowledged. Also, 
repeated-dose studies conducted in 
experimental animals are designed to 
produce toxicity at the highest dose used in 
order to optimize the test objective and so 
most studies will reveal some toxic effect at 
least at this highest dose. What is therefore 
to be decided is not only what effects have 
been produced, but also at what dose/ 
concentration they were produced and how 
relevant that is for humans. 
A.9.2.9.3 Thus, in animal studies, when 
significant toxic effects are observed that 
indicate classification, consideration of the 
duration of experimental exposure and the 
dose/concentration at which these effects 
were seen, in relation to the suggested 
guidance values, provides useful information 
to help assess the need to classify (since the 
toxic effects are a consequence of the 
hazardous property(ies) and also the duration 
of exposure and the dose/concentration). 
A.9.2.9.4 The decision to classify at all 
can be influenced by reference to the dose/ 
concentration guidance values at or below 
which a significant toxic effect has been 
observed. 
A.9.2.9.5 The guidance values refer to 
effects seen in a standard 90-day toxicity 
study conducted in rats. They can be used as 
a basis to extrapolate equivalent guidance 
values for toxicity studies of greater or lesser 
duration, using dose/exposure time 
extrapolation similar to Haber’s rule for 
inhalation, which states essentially that the 
effective dose is directly proportional to the 
exposure concentration and the duration of 
exposure. The assessment should be done on 
a case-by-case basis; for example, for a 28-day 
study the guidance values below would be 
increased by a factor of three. 
A.9.2.9.6 Thus for Category 1 
classification, significant toxic effects 
observed in a 90-day repeated-dose study 
conducted in experimental animals and seen 
to occur at or below the (suggested) guidance 
values (C) as indicated in Table A.9.1 would 
justify classification: 
TABLE A.9.1—GUIDANCE VALUES TO ASSIST IN CATEGORY 1 CLASSIFICATION 
[Applicable to a 90-day study] 
Route of exposure Units 
Guidance values 
(dose/ 
concentration) 
Oral (rat) .............................................................................................................. mg/kg body weight/day ........... C ≤ 10. 
Dermal (rat or rabbit) ........................................................................................... mg/kg body weight/day ........... C ≤ 20. 
Inhalation (rat) gas ............................................................................................... ppmV/6h/day ........................... C ≤ 50.

Inhalation (rat) dust/mist/fume ............................................................................. mg/liter/6h/day ......................... C ≤ 0.02. 
A.9.2.9.7 For Category 2 classification, 
significant toxic effects observed in a 90-day 
repeated-dose study conducted in 
experimental animals and seen to occur 
within the (suggested) guidance value ranges 
as indicated in Table A.9.2 would justify 
classification:

A.9.2.9.8 The guidance values and ranges 
mentioned in A.2.9.9.6 and A.2.9.9.7 are 
intended only for guidance purposes, i.e., to 
be used as part of the weight of evidence 
approach, and to assist with decisions about 
classification. They are not intended as strict 
demarcation values. 
A.9.2.9.9 Thus, it is feasible that a 
specific profile of toxicity occurs in repeat- 
dose animal studies at a dose/concentration 
below the guidance value, e.g., < 100 mg/kg 
body weight/day by the oral route; however 
the nature of the effect, e.g., nephrotoxicity 
seen only in male rats of a particular strain 
known to be susceptible to this effect, may 
result in the decision not to classify. 
Conversely, a specific profile of toxicity may 
be seen in animal studies occurring at or 
above a guidance value, e.g., ≥ 100 mg/kg 
body weight/day by the oral route, and in 
addition there is supplementary information 
from other sources, e.g., other long-term 
administration studies, or human case 
experience, which supports a conclusion 
that, in view of the weight of evidence, 
classification is prudent. 
A.9.2.10 Other Considerations 
A.9.2.10.1 When a substance is 
characterized only by use of animal data 
(typical of new substances, but also true for 
many existing substances), the classification 
process includes reference to dose/ 
concentration guidance values as one of the 
elements that contribute to the weight of 
evidence approach. 
A.9.2.10.2 When well-substantiated 
human data are available showing a specific 
target organ toxic effect that can be reliably 
attributed to repeated or prolonged exposure 
to a substance, the substance shall be 
classified. Positive human data, regardless of 
probable dose, predominates over animal 
data. Thus, if a substance is unclassified 
because no specific target organ toxicity was 
seen at or below the dose/concentration 
guidance value for animal testing, if 
subsequent human incidence data become 
available showing a specific target organ 
toxic effect, the substance shall be classified. 
A.9.2.10.3 A substance that has not been 
tested for specific target organ toxicity may 
in certain instances, where appropriate, be 
classified on the basis of data from a 
validated structure activity relationship and 
expert judgment-based extrapolation from a 
structural analogue that has previously been 
classified together with substantial support 
from consideration of other important factors 
such as formation of common significant 
metabolites. 
A.9.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 
A.9.3.1 Mixtures are classified using the 
same criteria as for substances, or 
alternatively as described below. As with 
substances, mixtures may be classified for 
specific target organ toxicity following single 
exposure, repeated exposure, or both. 
A.9.3.2 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for the Complete Mixture 
When reliable and good quality evidence 
from human experience or appropriate 
studies in experimental animals, as described 
in the criteria for substances, is available for 
the mixture, then the mixture shall be 
classified by weight of evidence evaluation of 
this data. Care shall be exercised in 
evaluating data on mixtures, that the dose, 
duration, observation or analysis, do not 
render the results inconclusive. 
A.9.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When

been tested to determine its specific target 
organ toxicity, but there are sufficient data on 
both the individual ingredients and similar 
tested mixtures to adequately characterize 
the hazards of the mixture, these data shall 
be used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution; Batching; 
Concentration of mixtures; Interpolation 
within one toxicity category; Substantially 
similar mixtures; and Aerosols. 
A.9.3.4 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for All Ingredients or 
Only for Some Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.9.3.4.1 Where there is no reliable 
evidence or test data for the specific mixture 
itself, and the bridging principles cannot be 
used to enable classification, then 
classification of the mixture is based on the 
classification of the ingredient substances. In 
this case, the mixture shall be classified as 
a specific target organ toxicant (specific organ 
specified), following single exposure, 
repeated exposure, or both when at least one 
ingredient has been classified as a Category 
1 or Category 2 specific target organ toxicant 
and is present at or above the appropriate 
cut-off value/concentration limit specified in 
Table A.9.3 for Category 1 and 2 respectively 
in accordance with A.0.2.1. 
TABLE A.9.3—CUTOFF VALUE/CONCENTRATION LIMITS OF INGREDIENTS OF A MIXTURE CLASSIFIED AS A SPECIFIC TARGET 
ORGAN TOXICANT THAT WOULD TRIGGER CLASSIFICATION OF THE MIXTURE AS CATEGORY 1 OR 2 
Ingredient classified as: 
Cut-off values/concentration limits trig-
gering classification of a mixture as: 
Category 1 Category 2 
Category 1: Target organ toxicant ........................................................................................................... ≥ 1.0%. 
Category 2: Target organ toxicant ........................................................................................................... ................................ ≥ 1.0%. 
A.9.3.4.2 These cut-off values and 
consequent classifications shall be applied 
equally and appropriately to both single- and 
repeated-dose target organ toxicants. 
A.9.3.4.3 Mixtures shall be classified for 
either or both single- and repeated-dose 
toxicity independently. 
A.9.3.4.4 Care shall be exercised when 
toxicants affecting more than one organ 
system are combined that the potentiation or 
synergistic interactions are considered, 
because certain substances can cause specific 
target organ toxicity at < 1% concentration 
when other ingredients in the mixture are 
known to potentiate its toxic effect. See 
A.0.2.1. 
A.10 ASPIRATION HAZARD 
A.10.1 Definitions and General and 
Specific Considerations 
A.10.1.1 Aspiration means the entry of a 
liquid or solid chemical directly through the 
oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from 
vomiting, into the trachea and lower 
respiratory system. 
A.10.1.2 Aspiration toxicity includes 
severe acute effects such as chemical 
pneumonia, varying degrees of pulmonary 
injury or death following aspiration. 
A.10.1.3 Aspiration is initiated at the 
moment of inspiration, in the time required 
to take one breath, as the causative material 
lodges at the crossroad of the upper 
respiratory and digestive tracts in the 
laryngopharyngeal region. 
A.10.1.4 Aspiration of a substance or 
mixture can occur as it is vomited following 
ingestion. This may have consequences for 
labeling, particularly where, due to acute 
toxicity, a recommendation may be 
considered to induce vomiting after 
ingestion. However, if the substance/mixture 
also presents an aspiration toxicity hazard, 
the recommendation to induce vomiting may 
need to be modified. 
A.10.1.5 Specific Considerations 
A.10.1.5.1 The classification criteria refer 
to kinematic viscosity. The following 
provides the conversion between dynamic 
and kinematic viscosity:

A.10.1.5.2 Although the definition of 
aspiration in A.10.1.1 includes the entry of 
solids into the respiratory system, 
classification according to (b) in table A.10.1 
for Category 1 is intended to apply to liquid 
substances and mixtures only. 
A.10.1.5.3 Classification of Aerosol/Mist 
Products 
Aerosol and mist products are usually 
dispensed in containers such as self- 
pressurized containers, trigger and pump 
sprayers. Classification for these products 
shall be considered if their use may form a 
pool of product in the mouth, which then 
may be aspirated. If the mist or aerosol from 
a pressurized container is fine, a pool may 
not be formed. On the other hand, if a 
pressurized container dispenses product in a 
stream, a pool may be formed that may then 
be aspirated. Usually, the mist produced by 
trigger and pump sprayers is coarse and 
therefore, a pool may be formed that then 
may be aspirated. When the pump 
mechanism may be removed and contents are 
available to be swallowed then the 
classification of the products should be 
considered. 
A.10.2 Classification Criteria for 
Substances 
TABLE A.10.1—CRITERIA FOR ASPIRATION TOXICITY 
Category Criteria 
Category 1: Chemicals known to cause human aspiration 
toxicity hazards or to be regarded as if they cause 
human aspiration toxicity hazard.
A substance shall be classified in Category 1: 
(a) If reliable and good quality human evidence indicates that it causes aspira-
tion toxicity (See note 1); or 
(b) If it is a hydrocarbon and has a kinematic viscosity ≤ 20.5 mm2/s, measured 
at 40 °C. 
Note 1: Examples of substances included in Category 1 are certain hydrocarbons, turpentine and pine oil. 
A.10.3 Classification Criteria for Mixtures 
A.10.3.1 Classification When Data Are 
Available for the Complete Mixture 
A mixture shall be classified in Category 1 
based on reliable and good quality human 
evidence. 
A.10.3.2 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Not Available for the Complete 
Mixture: Bridging Principles 
A.10.3.2.1 Where the mixture itself has 
not been tested to determine its aspiration 
toxicity, but there are sufficient data on both 
the individual ingredients and similar tested 
mixtures to adequately characterize the 
hazard of the mixture, these data shall be 
used in accordance with the following 
bridging principles as found in paragraph 
A.0.5 of this Appendix: Dilution; Batching; 
Concentration of mixtures; Interpolation 
within one toxicity category; and 
Substantially similar mixtures. For 
application of the dilution bridging principle, 
the concentration of aspiration toxicants 
shall not be less than 10%. 
A.10.3.3 Classification of Mixtures When 
Data Are Available for All Ingredients or 
Only for Some Ingredients of the Mixture 
A.10.3.3.1 A mixture which contains ≥ 
10% of an ingredient or ingredients classified 
in Category 1, and has a kinematic viscosity 
≤ 20.5 mm 2/s, measured at 40 °C, shall be 
classified in Category 1. 
A.10.3.3.2 In the case of a mixture which 
separates into two or more distinct layers, 
one of which contains ≥ 10% of an ingredient 
or ingredients classified in Category 1 and 
has a kinematic viscosity ≤ 20.5 mm 2/s, 
measured at 40 °C, then the entire mixture 
shall be classified in Category 1. 
Appendix B to § 1910.1200—Physical 
Hazard Criteria (Mandatory) 
B.1 EXPLOSIVES 
B.1.1 Definitions and General 
Considerations 
B.1.1.1 An explosive chemical is a solid 
or liquid chemical which is in itself capable 
by chemical reaction of producing gas at such 
a temperature and pressure and at such a 
speed as to cause damage to the 
surroundings. Pyrotechnic chemicals are 
included even when they do not evolve 
gases. 
A pyrotechnic chemical is a chemical 
designed to produce an effect by heat, light, 
sound, gas or smoke or a combination of 
these as the result of non-detonative self- 
sustaining exothermic chemical reactions. 
An explosive item is an item containing 
one or more explosive chemicals. 
A pyrotechnic item is an item containing 
one or more pyrotechnic chemicals. 
An unstable explosive is an explosive 
which is thermally unstable and/or too 
sensitive for normal handling, transport, or 
use. 
An intentional explosive is a chemical or 
item which is manufactured with a view to 
produce a practical explosive or pyrotechnic 
effect. 
B.1.1.2 The class of explosives comprises: 
(a) Explosive chemicals; 
(b) Explosive items, except devices 
containing explosive chemicals in such 
quantity or of such a character that their 
inadvertent or accidental ignition or 
initiation shall not cause any effect external 
to the device either by projection, fire, 
smoke, heat or loud noise; and 
(c) Chemicals and items not included 
under (a) and (b) above which are 
manufactured with the view to producing a 
practical explosive or pyrotechnic effect. 
B.1.2 Classification Criteria 
Chemicals and items of this class shall be 
classified as unstable explosives or shall be 
assigned to one of the following six divisions 
depending on the type of hazard they 
present: 
(a) Division 1.1 Chemicals and items 
which have a mass explosion hazard (a mass 
explosion is one which affects almost the 
entire quantity present virtually 
instantaneously); 
(b) Division 1.2 Chemicals and items 
which have a projection hazard but not a 
mass explosion hazard; 
(c) Division 1.3 Chemicals and items 
which have a fire hazard and either a minor 
blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or 
both, but not a mass explosion hazard: 
(i) combustion of which gives rise to 
considerable radiant heat; or 
(ii) which burn one after another, 
producing minor blast or projection effects or 
both; 
(d) Division 1.4 Chemicals and items 
which present no significant hazard: 
chemicals and items which present only a 
small hazard in the event of ignition or 
initiation. The effects are largely confined to 
the package and no projection of fragments 
of appreciable size or range is to be expected. 
An external fire shall not cause virtually 
instantaneous explosion of almost the entire 
contents of the package; 
(e) Division 1.5 Very insensitive 
chemicals which have a mass explosion 
hazard: chemicals which have a mass 
explosion hazard but are so insensitive that 
there is very little probability of initiation or 
of transition from burning to detonation 
under normal conditions; 
(f) Division 1.6 Extremely insensitive 
items which do not have a mass explosion 
hazard: items which contain only extremely 
insensitive detonating chemicals and which 
demonstrate a negligible probability of 
accidental initiation or propagation.

B.1.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.1.3.1 Explosives shall be classified as 
unstable explosives or shall be assigned to 
one of the six divisions identified in B.1.2 in 
accordance with the three step procedure in 
Part I of the UN Recommendations on the 
Transport of Dangerous Goods, Manual of 
Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition. 
The first step is to ascertain whether the 
substance or mixture has explosive effects 
(Test Series 1). The second step is the 
acceptance procedure (Test Series 2 to 4) and 
the third step is the assignment to a hazard 
division (Test Series 5 to 7). The assessment 
whether a candidate for ‘‘ammonium nitrate 
emulsion or suspension or gel, intermediate 
for blasting explosives (ANE)’’ is insensitive 
enough for inclusion as an oxidizing liquid 
(see B.13) or an oxidizing solid (see B.14) is 
determined by Test Series 8 tests. 
Note: Classification of solid chemicals 
shall be based on tests performed on the 
chemical as presented. If, for example, for the 
purposes of supply or transport, the same 
chemical is to be presented in a physical 
form different from that which was tested 
and which is considered likely to materially 
alter its performance in a classification test, 
classification must be based on testing of the 
chemical in the new form. 
B.1.3.2 Explosive properties are 
associated with the presence of certain 
chemical groups in a molecule which can 
react to produce very rapid increases in 
temperature or pressure. The screening 
procedure in B.1.3.3 is aimed at identifying 
the presence of such reactive groups and the 
potential for rapid energy release. If the 
screening procedure identifies the chemical 
as a potential explosive, the acceptance 
procedure (see section 10.3 of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition) is necessary 
for classification. 
Note: Neither a Series 1 type (a) 
propagation of detonation test nor a Series 2 
type (a) test of sensitivity to detonative shock 
is necessary if the exothermic decomposition 
energy of organic materials is less than 800 
J/g. 
B.1.3.3 If a mixture contains any known 
explosives, the acceptance procedure is 
necessary for classification. 
B.1.3.4 A chemical is not classified as 
explosive if: 
(a) There are no chemical groups 
associated with explosive properties present 
in the molecule. Examples of groups which 
may indicate explosive properties are given 
in Table A6.1 in Appendix 6 of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition; or 
(b) The substance contains chemical 
groups associated with explosive properties 
which include oxygen and the calculated 
oxygen balance is less than ¥200. 
The oxygen balance is calculated for the 
chemical reaction: 
CxHyOz + [x + (y/4)¥(z/2)] O2 → x. CO2 + 
(y/2) H2O 
using the formula: oxygen balance = 
¥1600 [2x +(y/2) ¥z]/molecular weight; 
(c) The organic substance or a homogenous 
mixture of organic substances contains 
chemical groups associated with explosive 
properties but the exothermic decomposition 
energy is less than 500 J/g and the onset of 
exothermic decomposition is below 500°C. 
The exothermic decomposition energy may 
be determined using a suitable calorimetric 
technique; or 
(d) For mixtures of inorganic oxidizing 
substances with organic material(s), the 
concentration of the inorganic oxidizing 
substance is: 
less than 15%, by mass, if the oxidizing 
substance is assigned to Category 1 or 2; 
less than 30%, by mass, if the oxidizing 
substance is assigned to Category 3. 
B.2 FLAMMABLE GASES 
B.2.1 Definition 
Flammable gas means a gas having a 
flammable range with air at 20°C and a 
standard pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi). 
B.2.2 Classification Criteria 
A flammable gas shall be classified in one 
of the two categories for this class in 
accordance with Table B.2.1: 
TABLE B.2.1—CRITERIA FOR FLAMMABLE GASES 
Category Criteria 
1 ............................................................... Gases, which at 20°C (68°F) and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi): 
(a) are ignitable when in a mixture of 13% or less by volume in air; or 
(b) have a flammable range with air of at least 12 percentage points regardless of the lower flam-
mable limit. 
2 ............................................................... Gases, other than those of Category 1, which, at 20°C (68°F) and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa 
(14.7 psi), have a flammable range while mixed in air. 
Note: Aerosols should not be classified as 
flammable gases. See B.3. 
B.2.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
Flammability shall be determined by tests 
or by calculation in accordance with methods 
adopted by ISO (see ISO 10156:1996 ‘‘Gases 
and gas mixtures—Determination of fire 
potential and oxidizing ability for the 
selection of cylinder valve outlets’’). Where 
insufficient data are available to use these 
methods, equivalent validated methods may 
be used. 
B.3 FLAMMABLE AEROSOLS 
B.3.1 Definition 
Aerosol means any non-refillable 
receptacle containing a gas compressed, 
liquefied or dissolved under pressure, and 
fitted with a release device allowing the 
contents to be ejected as particles in 
suspension in a gas, or as a foam, paste, 
powder, liquid or gas. 
B.3.2 Classification Criteria 
B.3.2.1 Aerosols shall be considered for 
classification as flammable if they contain 
any component which is classified as 
flammable in accordance with this 
Appendix, i.e.: 
Flammable liquids (see B.6); 
Flammable gases (see B.2); 
Flammable solids (see B.7). 
Note 1: Flammable components do not 
include pyrophoric, self-heating or water- 
reactive chemicals. 
Note 2: Flammable aerosols do not fall 
additionally within the scope of flammable 
gases, flammable liquids, or flammable 
solids. 
B.3.2.2 A flammable aerosol shall be 
classified in one of the two categories for this 
class in accordance with Table B.3.1. 
TABLE B.3.1—CRITERIA FOR FLAMMABLE AEROSOLS 
Category Criteria 
1 ......................... Contains ≥ 85% of flammable components and the chemical heat of combustion is ≥ 30 kJ/g; or 
(a) for spray aerosols, in the ignition distance test, ignition occurs at a distance ≥ 75 cm, or 
(b) for foam aerosols, in the aerosol foam flammability test. 
(i) the flame height is ≥ 20 cm and the flame duration ≥ 2 s; or 
(ii) the flame height is ≥ 4 cm and the flame duration ≥ 7 s. 
2 ......................... Contains > 1% flammable components, or the heat of combustion is ≥ 20 kJ/g; and

Category Criteria 
(a) for spray aerosols, in the ignition distance test, ignition occurs at a distance ≥ 15 cm, or in the enclosed space igni-
tion test, the 
(i) time equivalent is ≤ 300 s/m 3; or 
(ii) deflagration density is ≤ 300 g/m 3. 
(b) for foam aerosols, in the aerosol foam flammability test, the flame height is ≥ 4 cm and the flame duration is ≥ 2 s 
and it does not meet the criteria for Category 1. 
Note: Aerosols not submitted to the 
flammability classification procedures in this 
Appendix shall be classified as extremely 
flammable (Category 1). 
B.3.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.3.3.1 To classify a flammable aerosol, 
data on its flammable components, on its 
chemical heat of combustion and, if 
applicable, the results of the aerosol foam 
flammability test (for foam aerosols) and of 
the ignition distance test and enclosed space 
test (for spray aerosols) are necessary. 
B.3.3.2 The chemical heat of combustion 
(DHc), in kilojoules per gram (kJ/g), is the 
product of the theoretical heat of combustion 
(DHcomb), and a combustion efficiency, 
usually less than 1.0 (a typical combustion 
efficiency is 0.95 or 95%). 
For a composite aerosol formulation, the 
chemical heat of combustion is the 
summation of the weighted heats of 
combustion for the individual components, 
as follows: 
Δ ΔHc (product) = [wi% Hc(i)]
i
n
×∑
Where: 
DHc = chemical heat of combustion (kJ/g); 
wi% = mass fraction of component i in the 
product; 
DHc(i) = specific heat of combustion (kJ/g) of 
component i in the product; 
The chemical heats of combustion shall be 
found in literature, calculated or determined 
by tests (see ASTM D240–02(2007)— 
Standard Test Methods for Heat of 
Combustion of Liquid Hydrocarbon Fuels by 
Bomb Calorimeter, ISO/FDIS 13943:1999, 
86.1 to 86.3—Fire safety—Vocabulary, and 
NFPA 30B—Code for the Manufacture and 
Storage of Aerosol Products, 2007 Edition). 
B.3.3.3 The Ignition distance test, 
Enclosed space ignition test and Aerosol 
foam flammability test shall be performed in 
accordance with sub-sections 31.4, 31.5 and 
31.6 of the of the UN Recommendations on 
the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Manual 
of Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition. 
B.4 OXIDIZING GASES 
B.4.1 Definition 
Oxidizing gas means any gas which may, 
generally by providing oxygen, cause or 
contribute to the combustion of other 
material more than air does. 
Note: ‘‘Gases which cause or contribute to 
the combustion of other material more than 
air does’’ means pure gases or gas mixtures 
with an oxidizing power greater than 23.5% 
(as determined, by a method specified in ISO 
10156:1996 or 10156–2:2005 or an equivalent 
testing method.) 
B.4.2 Classification Criteria 
An oxidizing gas shall be classified in a 
single category for this class in accordance 
with Table B.4.1: 
TABLE B.4.1—CRITERIA FOR OXIDIZING GASES 
Category Criteria 
1 ......................... Any gas which may, generally by providing oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other material more than air 
does. 
B.4.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
Classification shall be in accordance with 
tests or calculation methods as described in 
ISO 10156:1996 ‘‘Gases and gas mixtures— 
Determination of fire potential and oxidizing 
ability for the selection of cylinder valve 
outlet’’ and ISO 10156–2:2005 ‘‘Gas 
cylinders, Gases and gas mixtures. Part 2: 
Determination of oxidizing ability of toxic 
and corrosive gases and gas mixtures’’. 
B.5 GASES UNDER PRESSURE 
B.5.1 Definition 
Gases under pressure are gases which are 
contained in a receptacle at a pressure of 200 
kPa (29 psi) (gauge) or more, or which are 
liquefied or liquefied and refrigerated. They 
comprise compressed gases, liquefied gases, 
dissolved gases and refrigerated liquefied 
gases. 
B.5.2 Classification Criteria 
Gases under pressure shall be classified in 
one of four groups in accordance with Table 
B.5.1:  
TABLE B.5.1—CRITERIA FOR GASES UNDER PRESSURE 
Group Criteria 
Compressed gas ............................. A gas which when under pressure is entirely gaseous at –50 °C (¥58 °F); including all gases with a crit-
ical temperature 1 ≤ ¥50 °C (¥58 °F). 
Liquefied gas ................................... A gas which when under pressure is partially liquid at temperatures above ¥50 °C (¥58 °F). A distinction 
is made between: 
(a) High pressure liquefied gas: a gas with a critical temperature1 between ¥50 °C (¥58 °F) and +65 
°C (149 °F); and 
(b) Low pressure liquefied gas: a gas with a critical temperature 1 above +65 °C (149 °F). 
Refrigerated liquefied gas ............... A gas which is made partially liquid because of its low temperature. 
Dissolved gas .................................. A gas which when under pressure is dissolved in a liquid phase solvent. 
(1) The critical temperature is the temperature above which a pure gas cannot be liquefied, regardless of the degree of compression.

B.6 FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS 
B.6.1 Definition 
Flammable liquid means a liquid having a 
flash point of not more than 93 °C (199.4 °F). 
B.6.2 Classification Criteria 
A flammable liquid shall be classified in 
one of four categories in accordance with 
Table B.6.1: 
TABLE B.6.1—CRITERIA FOR FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS

4 ...................................................... Flash point > 60 °C (140 °F) and ≤ 93 °C (199.4 °F). 
B.6.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
The flash point shall be determined in 
accordance with Standard Method of Test for 
Flash Point by Tag Closed Tester (ASTM D 
56–93), Standard Methods of Test for Flash 
Point of Liquids by Setaflash Closed Tester 
(ASTM D 3278–96), Standard Methods of 
Test for Flash Point by Small Scale Closed 
Tester (ASTM D 3828–93), Standard Method 
of Test for Flash Point by Pensky-Martens 
Closed Tester (ASTM D 0093–96), or any 
other method specified in GHS Revision 3, 
Chapter 2.6. 
The initial boiling point shall be 
determined in accordance with ‘‘Standard 
Test Method for Distillation of Petroleum 
Products at Atmospheric Pressure (ASTM 
D86–07a) or Standard Test Method for 
Distillation Range of Volatile Organic Liquids 
(ASTM D1078–05). 
B.7 FLAMMABLE SOLIDS 
B.7.1 Definitions 
Flammable solid means a solid which is a 
readily combustible solid, or which may 
cause or contribute to fire through friction. 
Readily combustible solids are powdered, 
granular, or pasty chemicals which are 
dangerous if they can be easily ignited by 
brief contact with an ignition source, such as 
a burning match, and if the flame spreads 
rapidly. 
B.7.2 Classification Criteria 
B.7.2.1 Powdered, granular or pasty 
chemicals shall be classified as flammable 
solids when the time of burning of one or 
more of the test runs, performed in 
accordance with the test method described in 
the UN Recommendations on the Transport 
of Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, Part III, sub- 
section 33.2.1, is less than 45 s or the rate of 
burning is more than 2.2 mm/s. 
B.7.2.2 Powders of metals or metal alloys 
shall be classified as flammable solids when 
they can be ignited and the reaction spreads 
over the whole length of the sample in 10 
min or less. 
B.7.2.3 Solids which may cause fire 
through friction shall be classified in this 
class by analogy with existing entries (e.g., 
matches) until definitive criteria are 
established. 
B.7.2.4 A flammable solid shall be 
classified in one of the two categories for this 
class using Method N.1 as described in Part 
III, sub-section 33.2.1 of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, in 
accordance with Table B.7.1: 
TABLE B.7.1—CRITERIA FOR FLAMMABLE SOLIDS 
Category Criteria

Note: Classification of solid chemicals 
shall be based on tests performed on the 
chemical as presented. If, for example, for the 
purposes of supply or transport, the same 
chemical is to be presented in a physical 
form different from that which was tested 
and which is considered likely to materially 
alter its performance in a classification test, 
classification must be based on testing of the 
chemical in the new form. 
B.8 SELF-REACTIVE CHEMICALS 
B.8.1 Definitions 
Self-reactive chemicals are thermally 
unstable liquid or solid chemicals liable to 
undergo a strongly exothermic 
decomposition even without participation of 
oxygen (air). This definition excludes 
chemicals classified under this section as 
explosives, organic peroxides, oxidizing 
liquids or oxidizing solids. 
A self-reactive chemical is regarded as 
possessing explosive properties when in 
laboratory testing the formulation is liable to 
detonate, to deflagrate rapidly or to show a 
violent effect when heated under 
confinement. 
B.8.2 Classification Criteria 
B.8.2.1 A self-reactive chemical shall be 
considered for classification in this class 
unless: 
(a) It is classified as an explosive according 
to B.1 of this appendix; 
(b) It is classified as an oxidizing liquid or 
an oxidizing solid according to B.13 or B.14 
of this appendix, except that a mixture of 
oxidizing substances which contains 5% or 
more of combustible organic substances shall 
be classified as a self-reactive chemical 
according to the procedure defined in 
B.8.2.2; 
(c) It is classified as an organic peroxide 
according to B.15 of this appendix; 
(d) Its heat of decomposition is less than 
300 J/g; or 
(e) Its self-accelerating decomposition 
temperature (SADT) is greater than 75 °C 
(167 °F) for a 50 kg package. 
B.8.2.2 Mixtures of oxidizing substances, 
meeting the criteria for classification as 
oxidizing liquids or oxidizing solids, which 
contain 5% or more of combustible organic 
substances and which do not meet the 
criteria mentioned in B.8.2.1 (a), (c), (d) or 
(e), shall be subjected to the self-reactive 
chemicals classification procedure in B.8.2.3. 
Such a mixture showing the properties of a 
self-reactive chemical type B to F shall be 
classified as a self-reactive chemical.

B.8.2.3 Self-reactive chemicals shall be 
classified in one of the seven categories of 
‘‘types A to G’’ for this class, according to the 
following principles: 
(a) Any self-reactive chemical which can 
detonate or deflagrate rapidly, as packaged, 
will be defined as self-reactive chemical 
TYPE A; 
(b) Any self-reactive chemical possessing 
explosive properties and which, as packaged, 
neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly, but 
is liable to undergo a thermal explosion in 
that package will be defined as self-reactive 
chemical TYPE B; 
(c) Any self-reactive chemical possessing 
explosive properties when the chemical as 
packaged cannot detonate or deflagrate 
rapidly or undergo a thermal explosion will 
be defined as self-reactive chemical TYPE C; 
(d) Any self-reactive chemical which in 
laboratory testing: 
(i) Detonates partially, does not deflagrate 
rapidly and shows no violent effect when 
heated under confinement; or 
(ii) Does not detonate at all, deflagrates 
slowly and shows no violent effect when 
heated under confinement; or 
(iii) Does not detonate or deflagrate at all 
and shows a medium effect when heated 
under confinement; 
will be defined as self-reactive chemical 
TYPE D; 
(e) Any self-reactive chemical which, in 
laboratory testing, neither detonates nor 
deflagrates at all and shows low or no effect 
when heated under confinement will be 
defined as self-reactive chemical TYPE E; 
(f) Any self-reactive chemical which, in 
laboratory testing, neither detonates in the 
cavitated state nor deflagrates at all and 
shows only a low or no effect when heated 
under confinement as well as low or no 
explosive power will be defined as self- 
reactive chemical TYPE F; 
(g) Any self-reactive chemical which, in 
laboratory testing, neither detonates in the 
cavitated state nor deflagrates at all and 
shows no effect when heated under 
confinement nor any explosive power, 
provided that it is thermally stable (self- 
accelerating decomposition temperature is 60 
°C (140 °F) to 75 °C (167 °F) for a 50 kg 
package), and, for liquid mixtures, a diluent 
having a boiling point greater than or equal 
to 150 °C (302 °F) is used for desensitization 
will be defined as self-reactive chemical 
TYPE G. If the mixture is not thermally stable 
or a diluent having a boiling point less than 
150°C (302°F) is used for desensitization, the 
mixture shall be defined as self-reactive 
chemical TYPE F. 
B.8.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.8.3.1 For purposes of classification, the 
properties of self-reactive chemicals shall be 
determined in accordance with test series A 
to H as described in Part II of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition. 
B.8.3.2 Self-accelerating decomposition 
temperature (SADT) shall be determined in 
accordance with the UN Recommendations 
for the Transport of Dangerous Goods, 
Manual of Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised 
Edition, Part II, section 28. 
B.8.3.3 The classification procedures for 
self-reactive substances and mixtures need 
not be applied if: 
(a) There are no chemical groups present 
in the molecule associated with explosive or 
self-reactive properties; examples of such 
groups are given in Tables A6.1 and A6.2 in 
the Appendix 6 of the UN Recommendations 
on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, 
Manual of Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised 
Edition; or 
(b) For a single organic substance or a 
homogeneous mixture of organic substances, 
the estimated SADT is greater than 75°C 
(167°F) or the exothermic decomposition 
energy is less than 300 J/g. The onset 
temperature and decomposition energy may 
be estimated using a suitable calorimetric 
technique (see 20.3.3.3 in Part II of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition). 
B.9.1 Definition 
Pyrophoric liquid means a liquid which, 
even in small quantities, is liable to ignite 
within five minutes after coming into contact 
with air. 
B.9.2 Classification Criteria 
A pyrophoric liquid shall be classified in 
a single category for this class using test N.3 
in Part III, sub-section 33.3.1.5 of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, in 
accordance with Table B.9.1: 
TABLE B.9.1—CRITERIA FOR PYROPHORIC LIQUIDS 
Category Criteria 
1 ...................................................... The liquid ignites within 5 min when added to an inert carrier and exposed to air, or it ignites or chars a fil-
ter paper on contact with air within 5 min. 
B.9.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
The classification procedure for pyrophoric 
liquids need not be applied when experience 
in production or handling shows that the 
chemical does not ignite spontaneously on 
coming into contact with air at normal 
temperatures (i.e. the substance is known to 
be stable at room temperature for prolonged 
periods of time (days)). 
B.10 PYROPHORIC SOLIDS 
B.10.1 Definition 
Pyrophoric solid means a solid which, even 
in small quantities, is liable to ignite within 
five minutes after coming into contact with 
air. 
B.10.2 Classification Criteria 
A pyrophoric solid shall be classified in a 
single category for this class using test N.2 in 
Part III, sub-section 33.3.1.4 of the UN 
Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition in 
accordance with Table B.10.1: 
TABLE B.10.1—CRITERIA FOR PYROPHORIC SOLIDS 
Category Criteria 
1 ...................................................... The solid ignites within 5 min of coming into contact with air. 
Note: Classification of solid chemicals 
shall be based on tests performed on the 
chemical as presented. If, for example, for the 
purposes of supply or transport, the same 
chemical is to be presented in a physical 
form different from that which was tested 
and which is considered likely to materially 
alter its performance in a classification test, 
classification must be based on testing of the 
chemical in the new form. 
B.10.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
The classification procedure for pyrophoric 
solids need not be applied when experience 
in production or handling shows that the 
chemical does not ignite spontaneously on 
coming into contact with air at normal 
temperatures (i.e. the chemical is known to 
be stable at room temperature for prolonged 
periods of time (days)). 
B.11 SELF-HEATING CHEMICALS 
B.11.1 Definition 
A self-heating chemical is a solid or liquid 
chemical, other than a pyrophoric liquid or 
solid, which, by reaction with air and 
without energy supply, is liable to self-heat;

this chemical differs from a pyrophoric 
liquid or solid in that it will ignite only when 
in large amounts (kilograms) and after long 
periods of time (hours or days). 
Note: Self-heating of a substance or 
mixture is a process where the gradual 
reaction of that substance or mixture with 
oxygen (in air) generates heat. If the rate of 
heat production exceeds the rate of heat loss, 
then the temperature of the substance or 
mixture will rise which, after an induction 
time, may lead to self-ignition and 
combustion. 
B.11.2 Classification Criteria 
B.11.2.1 A self-heating chemical shall be 
classified in one of the two categories for this 
class if, in tests performed in accordance 
with test method N.4 in Part III, sub-section 
33.3.1.6 of the UN Recommendations on the 
Transport of Dangerous Goods, Manual of 
Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, 
the result meets the criteria shown in Table 
B.11.1. 
TABLE B.11.1—CRITERIA FOR SELF-HEATING CHEMICALS 
Category Criteria 
1 ...................................................... A positive result is obtained in a test using a 25 mm sample cube at 140 °C (284 °F). 
2 ...................................................... A negative result is obtained in a test using a 25 mm cube sample at 140 °C (284 °F), a positive result is 
obtained in a test using a 100 mm sample cube at 140 °C (284 °F), and: 
(a) the unit volume of the chemical is more than 3 m3; or 
(b) a positive result is obtained in a test using a 100 mm cube sample at 120 °C (248 °F) and the unit 
volume of the chemical is more than 450 liters; or 
(c) a positive result is obtained in a test using a 100 mm cube sample at 100 °C (212 °F). 
B.11.2.2 Chemicals with a temperature of 
spontaneous combustion higher than 50 °C 
(122 °F) for a volume of 27 m3 shall not be 
classified as self-heating chemicals. 
B.11.2.3 Chemicals with a spontaneous 
ignition temperature higher than 50 °C (122 
°F) for a volume of 450 liters shall not be 
classified in Category 1 of this class. 
B.11.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.11.3.1 The classification procedure for 
self-heating chemicals need not be applied if 
the results of a screening test can be 
adequately correlated with the classification 
test and an appropriate safety margin is 
applied. 
B.11.3.2 Examples of screening tests are: 
(a) The Grewer Oven test (VDI guideline 
2263, part 1, 1990, Test methods for the 
Determination of the Safety Characteristics of 
Dusts) with an onset temperature 80°K above 
the reference temperature for a volume of 1 
l;

of the fire and explosion risks in drying 
powders, Plant Operations Progress, 4 (3), 
181–189, 1985) with an onset temperature 
60°K above the reference temperature for a 
volume of 1 l. 
B.12 CHEMICALS WHICH, IN CONTACT 
WITH WATER, EMIT FLAMMABLE GASES 
B.12.1 Definition 
Chemicals which, in contact with water, 
emit flammable gases are solid or liquid 
chemicals which, by interaction with water, 
are liable to become spontaneously 
flammable or to give off flammable gases in 
dangerous quantities. 
B.12.2 Classification Criteria 
B.12.2.1 A chemical which, in contact 
with water, emits flammable gases shall be 
classified in one of the three categories for 
this class, using test N.5 in Part III, sub- 
section 33.4.1.4 of the UN Recommendations 
on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, 
Manual of Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised 
Edition, in accordance with Table B.12.1: 
TABLE B.12.1—CRITERIA FOR CHEMICALS WHICH, IN CONTACT WITH WATER, EMIT FLAMMABLE GASES 
Category Criteria 
1 ...................................................... Any chemical which reacts vigorously with water at ambient temperatures and demonstrates generally a 
tendency for the gas produced to ignite spontaneously, or which reacts readily with water at ambient 
temperatures such that the rate of evolution of flammable gas is equal to or greater than 10 liters per 
kilogram of chemical over any one minute. 
2 ...................................................... Any chemical which reacts readily with water at ambient temperatures such that the maximum rate of evo-
lution of flammable gas is equal to or greater than 20 liters per kilogram of chemical per hour, and which 
does not meet the criteria for Category 1.

lution of flammable gas is equal to or greater than 1 liter per kilogram of chemical per hour, and which 
does not meet the criteria for Categories 1 and 2. 
Note: Classification of solid chemicals 
shall be based on tests performed on the 
chemical as presented. If, for example, for the 
purposes of supply or transport, the same 
chemical is to be presented in a physical 
form different from that which was tested 
and which is considered likely to materially 
alter its performance in a classification test, 
classification must be based on testing of the 
chemical in the new form. 
B.12.2.2 A chemical is classified as a 
chemical which, in contact with water, emits 
flammable gases if spontaneous ignition takes 
place in any step of the test procedure. 
B.12.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
The classification procedure for this class 
need not be applied if: 
(a) The chemical structure of the chemical 
does not contain metals or metalloids; 
(b) Experience in production or handling 
shows that the chemical does not react with 
water, (e.g., the chemical is manufactured 
with water or washed with water); or 
(c) The chemical is known to be soluble in 
water to form a stable mixture. 
B.13 OXIDIZING LIQUIDS 
B.13.1 Definition 
Oxidizing liquid means a liquid which, 
while in itself not necessarily combustible, 
may, generally by yielding oxygen, cause, or 
contribute to, the combustion of other 
material. 
B.13.2 Classification Criteria 
An oxidizing liquid shall be classified in 
one of the three categories for this class using 
test O.2 in Part III, sub-section 34.4.2 of the 
UN Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and

Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, in 
accordance with Table B.13.1: 
TABLE B.13.1—CRITERIA FOR OXIDIZING LIQUIDS 
Category Criteria 
1 ...................................................... Any chemical which, in the 1:1 mixture, by mass, of chemical and cellulose tested, spontaneously ignites; 
or the mean pressure rise time of a 1:1 mixture, by mass, of chemical and cellulose is less than that of a 
1:1 mixture, by mass, of 50% perchloric acid and cellulose; 
2 ...................................................... Any chemical which, in the 1:1 mixture, by mass, of chemical and cellulose tested, exhibits a mean pres-
sure rise time less than or equal to the mean pressure rise time of a 1:1 mixture, by mass, of 40% aque-
ous sodium chlorate solution and cellulose; and the criteria for Category 1 are not met; 
3 ...................................................... Any chemical which, in the 1:1 mixture, by mass, of chemical and cellulose tested, exhibits a mean pres-
sure rise time less than or equal to the mean pressure rise time of a 1:1 mixture, by mass, of 65% aque-
ous nitric acid and cellulose; and the criteria for Categories 1 and 2 are not met. 
B.13.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.13.3.1 For organic chemicals, the 
classification procedure for this class shall 
not be applied if: 
(a) The chemical does not contain oxygen, 
fluorine or chlorine; or 
(b) The chemical contains oxygen, fluorine 
or chlorine and these elements are 
chemically bonded only to carbon or 
hydrogen. 
B.13.3.2 For inorganic chemicals, the 
classification procedure for this class shall 
not be applied if the chemical does not 
contain oxygen or halogen atoms. 
B.13.3.3 In the event of divergence 
between tests results and known experience 
in the handling and use of chemicals which 
shows them to be oxidizing, judgements 
based on known experience shall take 
precedence over test results. 
B.13.3.4 In cases where chemicals 
generate a pressure rise (too high or too low), 
caused by chemical reactions not 
characterizing the oxidizing properties of the 
chemical, the test described in Part III, sub- 
section 34.4.2 of the UN Recommendations 
on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, 
Manual of Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised 
Edition shall be repeated with an inert 
substance (e.g., diatomite (kieselguhr)) in 
place of the cellulose in order to clarify the 
nature of the reaction. 
B.14 OXIDIZING SOLIDS 
B.14.1 Definition 
Oxidizing solid means a solid which, while 
in itself is not necessarily combustible, may, 
generally by yielding oxygen, cause, or 
contribute to, the combustion of other 
material. 
B.14.2 Classification Criteria 
An oxidizing solid shall be classified in 
one of the three categories for this class using 
test O.1 in Part III, sub-section 34.4.1 of the 
UN Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, in 
accordance with Table B.14.1: 
TABLE B.14.1—CRITERIA FOR OXIDIZING SOLIDS 
Category Criteria 
1 ......................... Any chemical which, in the 4:1 or 1:1 sample-to-cellulose ratio (by mass) tested, exhibits a mean burning time less than the 
mean burning time of a 3:2 mixture, by mass, of potassium bromate and cellulose. 
2 ......................... Any chemical which, in the 4:1 or 1:1 sample-to-cellulose ratio (by mass) tested, exhibits a mean burning time equal to or 
less than the mean burning time of a 2:3 mixture (by mass) of potassium bromate and cellulose and the criteria for Cat-
egory 1 are not met. 
3 ......................... Any chemical which, in the 4:1 or 1:1 sample-to-cellulose ratio (by mass) tested, exhibits a mean burning time equal to or 
less than the mean burning time of a 3:7 mixture (by mass) of potassium bromate and cellulose and the criteria for Cat-
egories 1 and 2 are not met. 
Note 1: Some oxidizing solids may present 
explosion hazards under certain conditions 
(e.g., when stored in large quantities). For 
example, some types of ammonium nitrate 
may give rise to an explosion hazard under 
extreme conditions and the ‘‘Resistance to 
detonation test’’ (IMO: Code of Safe Practice 
for Solid Bulk Cargoes, 2005, Annex 3, Test 
5) may be used to assess this hazard. When 
information indicates that an oxidizing solid 
may present an explosion hazard, it shall be 
indicated on the Safety Data Sheet. 
Note 2: Classification of solid chemicals 
shall be based on tests performed on the 
chemical as presented. If, for example, for the 
purposes of supply or transport, the same 
chemical is to be presented in a physical 
form different from that which was tested 
and which is considered likely to materially 
alter its performance in a classification test, 
classification must be based on testing of the 
chemical in the new form. 
B.14.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.14.3.1 For organic chemicals, the 
classification procedure for this class shall 
not be applied if: 
(a) The chemical does not contain oxygen, 
fluorine or chlorine; or 
(b) The chemical contains oxygen, fluorine 
or chlorine and these elements are 
chemically bonded only to carbon or 
hydrogen. 
B.14.3.2 For inorganic chemicals, the 
classification procedure for this class shall 
not be applied if the chemical does not 
contain oxygen or halogen atoms. 
B.14.3.3 In the event of divergence 
between tests results and known experience 
in the handling and use of chemicals which 
shows them to be oxidizing, judgements 
based on known experience shall take 
precedence over test results. 
B.15 ORGANIC PEROXIDES 
B.15.1 Definition 
B.15.1.1 Organic peroxide means a liquid 
or solid organic chemical which contains the 
bivalent –0–0– structure and as such is 
considered a derivative of hydrogen 
peroxide, where one or both of the hydrogen 
atoms have been replaced by organic 
radicals. The term organic peroxide includes 
organic peroxide mixtures containing at least 
one organic peroxide. Organic peroxides are 
thermally unstable chemicals, which may 
undergo exothermic self-accelerating 
decomposition. In addition, they may have 
one or more of the following properties: 
(a) Be liable to explosive decomposition; 
(b) Burn rapidly; 
(c) Be sensitive to impact or friction; 
(d) React dangerously with other 
substances. 
B.15.1.2 An organic peroxide is regarded 
as possessing explosive properties when in 
laboratory testing the formulation is liable to 
detonate, to deflagrate rapidly or to show a

(b) Not more than 0.5% available oxygen 
from the organic peroxides when containing 
more than 1.0% but not more than 7.0% 
hydrogen peroxide. 
Note: The available oxygen content (%) of 
an organic peroxide mixture is given by the 
formula: 
Where: 
ni = number of peroxygen groups per 
molecule of organic peroxide i; 
ci = concentration (mass %) of organic 
peroxide i; 
mi = molecular mass of organic peroxide i. 
B.15.2.2 Organic peroxides shall be 
classified in one of the seven categories of 
‘‘Types A to G’’ for this class, according to 
the following principles:

explosive properties and which, as packaged, 
neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly, but 
is liable to undergo a thermal explosion in 
that package shall be defined as organic 
peroxide TYPE B; 
(c) Any organic peroxide possessing 
explosive properties when the chemical as 
packaged cannot detonate or deflagrate 
rapidly or undergo a thermal explosion shall 
be defined as organic peroxide TYPE C; 
(d) Any organic peroxide which in 
laboratory testing: 
(i) Detonates partially, does not deflagrate 
rapidly and shows no violent effect when 
heated under confinement; or 
(ii) Does not detonate at all, deflagrates 
slowly and shows no violent effect when 
heated under confinement; or 
(iii) Does not detonate or deflagrate at all 
and shows a medium effect when heated 
under confinement; shall be defined as 
organic peroxide TYPE D; 
(e) Any organic peroxide which, in 
laboratory testing, neither detonates nor 
deflagrates at all and shows low or no effect 
when heated under confinement shall be 
defined as organic peroxide TYPE E; 
(f) Any organic peroxide which, in 
laboratory testing, neither detonates in the 
cavitated state nor deflagrates at all and 
shows only a low or no effect when heated 
under confinement as well as low or no

peroxide TYPE F; 
(g) Any organic peroxide which, in 
laboratory testing, neither detonates in the 
cavitated state nor deflagrates at all and 
shows no effect when heated under 
confinement nor any explosive power, 
provided that it is thermally stable (self- 
accelerating decomposition temperature is 60 
°C (140 °F) or higher for a 50 kg package), 
and, for liquid mixtures, a diluent having a 
boiling point of not less than 150 °C (302 °F) 
is used for desensitization, shall be defined 
as organic peroxide TYPE G. If the organic 
peroxide is not thermally stable or a diluent

B.15.3 Additional Classification 
Considerations 
B.15.3.1 For purposes of classification, 
the properties of organic peroxides shall be 
determined in accordance with test series A

Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods, Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition. 
B.15.3.2 Self-accelerating decomposition 
temperature (SADT) shall be determined in 
accordance with the UN Recommendations 
for the Transport of Dangerous Goods, 
Manual of Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised 
Edition, Part II, section 28. 
B.15.3.3 Mixtures of organic peroxides 
may be classified as the same type of organic 
peroxide as that of the most dangerous 
ingredient. However, as two stable 
ingredients can form a thermally less stable 
mixture, the SADT of the mixture shall be 
determined. 
B.16 CORROSIVE TO METALS 
B.16.1 Definition 
A chemical which is corrosive to metals 
means a chemical which by chemical action 
will materially damage, or even destroy, 
metals. 
B.16.2 Classification Criteria 
A chemical which is corrosive to metals 
shall be classified in a single category for this 
class, using the test in Part III, sub-section 
37.4 of the UN Recommendations on the 
Transport of Dangerous Goods, Manual of 
Tests and Criteria, Fourth Revised Edition, in 
accordance with Table B.16.1: 
TABLE B.16.1—CRITERIA FOR CHEMICALS CORROSIVE TO METAL 
Category Criteria 
1 ...................................................... Corrosion rate on either steel or aluminium surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm per year at a test temperature of 
55 °C (131 °F) when tested on both materials. 
Note: Where an initial test on either steel 
or aluminium indicates the chemical being 
tested is corrosive the follow-up test on the 
other metal is not necessary. 
B.16.3 Additional classification 
considerations 
The specimen to be used for the test shall 
be made of the following materials: 
(a) For the purposes of testing steel, steel 
types S235JR+CR (1.0037 resp.St 37–2), 
S275J2G3+CR (1.0144 resp.St 44–3), ISO 
3574, Unified Numbering System (UNS) G 
10200, or SAE 1020; 
(b) For the purposes of testing aluminium: 
non-clad types 7075–T6 or AZ5GU–T6. 
Appendix C to § 1910.1200– Allocation 
of Label Elements (Mandatory) 
C.1 The label for each hazardous 
chemical shall include the product identifier 
used on the safety data sheet 
C.1.1 The labels on shipped containers 
shall also include the name, address, and 
telephone number of the manufacturer, 
importer, or responsible party. 
C.2 The label for each hazardous 
chemical that is classified shall include the 
signal word, hazard statement(s), 
pictogram(s), and precautionary statement(s) 
specified in C.4 for each hazard class and 
associated hazard category, except as 
provided for in C.2.1 through C.2.4. For 
unclassified hazards, the label shall include 
a description of the hazards and appropriate 
precautions for safe handling and use under 
supplementary information. 
C.2.1 Precedence of Hazard Information 
C.2.1.1 If the signal word ‘‘Danger’’ is 
included, the signal word ‘‘Warning’’ shall 
not appear; 
C.2.1.2 If the skull and crossbones 
pictogram is included, the exclamation mark 
pictogram shall not appear where it is used 
for acute toxicity; 
C.2.1.3 If the corrosive pictogram is 
included, the exclamation mark pictogram 
shall not appear where it is used for skin or 
eye irritation; 
C.2.1.4 If the health hazard pictogram is 
included for respiratory sensitization, the 
exclamation mark pictogram shall not appear 
where it is used for skin sensitization or for 
skin or eye irritation. 
C.2.2 Hazard Statement Text 
C.2.2.1 The text of all applicable hazard 
statements shall appear on the label, except 
as otherwise specified. The information in 
italics shall be included as part of the hazard 
statement as provided. For example: ‘‘causes 
damage to organs (state all organs affected) 
through prolonged or repeated exposure 
(state route of exposure if no other routes of 
exposure cause the hazard)’’. Hazard 
statements may be combined where 
appropriate to reduce the information on the 
label and improve readability, as long as all 
of the hazards are conveyed as required.

BILLING CODE 4510–26–C 
C.2.3.3 Where a label required by the 
Department of Transportation under Title 49 
of the Code of Federal Regulations appears 
on a container, the pictogram specified in C.4 
for the same hazard shall not appear. 
C.2.4 Precautionary Statement Text 
C.2.4.1 There are four types of 
precautionary statements presented, 
‘‘prevention,’’ ‘‘response,’’ ‘‘storage,’’ and 
‘‘disposal.’’ The core part of the 
precautionary statement is presented in bold 
print. This is the text, except as otherwise 
specified, that shall appear on the label. 
Where additional information is required, it 
is indicated in plain text. 
C.2.4.2 When a backslash or diagonal 
mark [/] appears in the precautionary 
statement text, it indicates that a choice has 
to be made between the separated phrases. In 
such cases, the manufacturer, importer, or 
responsible party can choose the most 
appropriate phrase(s). For example, ‘‘Wear 
protective gloves/protective clothing/eye 
protection/face protection’’ could read ‘‘wear 
eye protection’’. 
C.2.4.3 When three full stops [* * *] 
appear in the precautionary statement text, 
they indicate that all applicable conditions 
are not listed. For example, in ‘‘Use 
explosion-proof electrical/ventilating/ 
lighting/* * */equipment’’, the use of 
‘‘* * *’’ indicates that other equipment may 
need to be specified. In such cases, the 
manufacturer, importer, or responsible party 
can choose the other conditions to be 
specified. 
C.2.4.4 When text in italics is used in a 
precautionary statement, this indicates 
specific conditions applying to the use or 
allocation of the precautionary statement. For 
example, ‘‘Use explosion-proof electrical/ 
ventilating/lighting/* * */equipment’’ is 
only required for flammable solids ‘‘if dust 
clouds can occur’’. Text in italics is intended 
to be an explanatory, conditional note and is 
not intended to appear on the label. 
C.2.4.5 Precautionary statements may be 
combined or consolidated to save label space 
and improve readability. For example, ‘‘Keep 
away from heat, sparks and open flame,’’ 
‘‘Store in a well-ventilated place’’ and ‘‘Keep 
cool’’ can be combined to read ‘‘Keep away 
from heat, sparks and open flame and store 
in a cool, well-ventilated place’’. 
C.2.4.6 In most cases, the precautionary 
statements are independent (e.g., the phrases 
for explosive hazards do not modify those 
related to certain health hazards and 
products that are classified for both hazard 
classes shall bear appropriate precautionary 
statements for both). Where a chemical is 
classified for a number of hazards, and the 
precautionary statements are similar, the 
most stringent shall be included on the label 
(this will be applicable mainly to preventive 
measures). An order of precedence may be 
imposed by the manufacturer, importer or 
responsible party in situations where phrases 
concern ‘‘Response.’’ Rapid action may be 
crucial. For example, if a chemical is 
carcinogenic and acutely toxic, rapid action 
may be crucial, and first aid measures for 
acute toxicity will take precedence over those 
for long term effects. In addition, medical 
attention to delayed health effects may be 
required in cases of incidental exposure, 
even if not associated with immediate 
symptoms of intoxication. 
C.3 Supplementary Hazard Information 
C.3.1 To ensure that non-standardized 
information does not lead to unnecessarily 
wide variation or undermine the required 
information, supplementary information on 
the label is limited to when it provides 
further detail and does not contradict or cast 
doubt on the validity of the standardized 
hazard information, or when it provides 
information about unclassified hazards. 
C.3.2 Where the manufacturer, importer, 
or distributor chooses to add supplementary 
information on the label, the placement of 
supplemental information shall not impede 
identification of information required by this 
section. 
C.3.3 Where an ingredient with unknown 
acute toxicity is used in a mixture at a 
concentration ≥ 1%, a statement that × 
percent of the mixture consists of 
ingredient(s) of unknown toxicity is required 
on the label.

Appendix F to § 1910.1200– Guidance 
for Hazard Classifications Re: 
Carcinogenicity (Non-Mandatory) 
The mandatory criteria for classification of 
a chemical for carcinogenicity are found in 
Chapter A.6. However, as noted in Footnote 
5 of that chapter, the GHS also included as 
guidance for classifiers the following 
information taken from the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 
Monographs programme on the evaluation of 
the strength and evidence of carcinogenic 
risks to humans. This guidance is consistent 
with Chapter A. 6, and should help in 
evaluating information to determine 
carcinogenicity. 
Background Guidance 
Carcinogenicity in Humans 
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity 
from studies in humans is classified into one 
of the following categories: 
(a) Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity: 
A causal relationship has been established 
between exposure to the agent, mixture or 
exposure circumstance and human cancer. 
That is, a positive relationship has been 
observed between the exposure and cancer in 
studies in which chance, bias and 
confounding could be ruled out with 
reasonable confidence; or, 
(b) Limited evidence of carcinogenicity: A 
positive association has been observed 
between exposure to the agent, mixture or 
exposure circumstance and cancer for which 
a causal interpretation is considered by the 
working group to be credible, but chance, 
bias or confounding could not be ruled out 
with reasonable confidence. 
In some instances the above categories may 
be used to classify the degree of evidence 
related to carcinogenicity in specific organs 
or tissues. 
Carcinogenicity in Experimental Animals 
The evidence relevant to carcinogenicity in 
experimental animals is classified into one of 
the following categories: 
(a) Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity: 
A causal relationship has been established 
between the agent or mixture and an 
increased incidence of malignant neoplasms 
or of an appropriate combination of benign 
and malignant neoplasms in (i) two or more 
species of animals or (ii) in two or more 
independent studies in one species carried 
out at different times or in different 
laboratories or under different protocols; 
(b) Exceptionally, a single study in one 
species might be considered to provide 
sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity when 
malignant neoplasms occur to an unusual 
degree with regard to incidence, site, type of 
tumor or age at onset; or, 
(c) Limited evidence of carcinogenicity: 
The data suggest a carcinogenic effect but are 
limited for making a definitive evaluation 
because, for example, (i) the evidence of 
carcinogenicity is restricted to a single 
experiment; or (ii) there are unresolved 
questions regarding the adequacy of the 
design, conduct or interpretation of the 
study; or (iii) the agent or mixture increases 
the incidence only of benign neoplasms or 
lesions of uncertain neoplastic potential, or 
of certain neoplasms which may occur 
spontaneously in high incidences in certain 
strains. 
Guidance on How to Consider Important 
Factors in Classification of Carcinogenicity* 
This section provides some considerations 
and an approach to analysis, rather than 
hard-and- fast rules. The weight of evidence 
analysis called for in GHS is an integrative 
approach which considers important factors 
in determining carcinogenic potential along 
with the strength of evidence analysis. The 
IPCS ‘‘Conceptual Framework for Evaluating 
a Mode of Action for Chemical 
carcinogenesis’’ (2001), the International Life 
Sciences Institute (ILSI) ‘‘Framework for 
Human Relevance Analysis of Information on 
Carcinogenic Modes of Action’’ (Meek et al., 
2003; Cohen et al., 2003, 2004) and the IARC 
(Preamble section 12(b)) provide a basis for 
systematic assessments which may be 
performed in a consistent fashion. The IPCS 
also convened a panel in 2004 to further 
develop and clarify the human relevance 
framework. However, the available 
documents are not intended to dictate 
answers, nor provide lists of criteria to be 
checked off. 
Mode of Action 
Various documents on carcinogen 
assessment all note that mode of action in 
and of itself, or consideration of comparative 
metabolism, should be evaluated on a case- 
by-case basis and are part of an analytic 
evaluative approach. One must look closely 
at any mode of action in animal experiments 
taking into consideration comparative 
toxicokinetics/toxicodynamics between the 
animal test species and humans to determine 
the relevance of the results to humans. This 
may lead to the possibility of discounting 
very specific effects of certain types of 
substances. Life stage-dependent effects on 
cellular differentiation may also lead to 
qualitative differences between animals and 
humans. Only if a mode of action of tumor 
development is conclusively determined not 
to be operative in humans may the 
carcinogenic evidence for that tumor be 
discounted. However, a weight of evidence 
evaluation for a substance calls for any other 
tumorigenic activity to be evaluated, as well.

Responses in Multiple Animal Experiments 
Positive responses in several species add to 
the weight of evidence that a substance is a 
carcinogen. Taking into account all of the 
factors listed in A.6.2.5.2 and more, such 
chemicals with positive outcomes in two or 
more species would be provisionally 
considered to be classified in GHS Category 
1B until human relevance of animal results 
are assessed in their entirety. It should be 
noted, however, that positive results for one 
species in at least two independent studies, 
or a single positive study showing unusually 
strong evidence of malignancy may also lead 
to Category 1B. 
Responses Are in One Sex or Both Sexes 
Any case of gender-specific tumors should 
be evaluated in light of the total tumorigenic 
response to the substance observed at other 
sites (multi-site responses or incidence above 
background) in determining the carcinogenic 
potential of the substance. 
If tumors are seen only in one sex of an 
animal species, the mode of action should be 
carefully evaluated to see if the response is 
consistent with the postulated mode of 
action. Effects seen only in one sex in a test 
species may be less convincing than effects 
seen in both sexes, unless there is a clear 
patho-physiological difference consistent 
with the mode of action to explain the single 
sex response. 
Confounding Effects of Excessive Toxicity or 
Localized Effects 
Tumors occurring only at excessive doses 
associated with severe toxicity generally have 
doubtful potential for carcinogenicity in 
humans. In addition, tumors occurring only 
at sites of contact and/or only at excessive 
doses need to be carefully evaluated for 
human relevance for carcinogenic hazard. 
For example, forestomach tumors, following 
administration by gavage of an irritating or 
corrosive, non-mutagenic chemical, may be 
of questionable relevance. However, such 
determinations must be evaluated carefully 
in justifying the carcinogenic potential for 
humans; any occurrence of other tumors at 
distant sites must also be considered. 
Tumor Type, Reduced Tumor Latency 
Unusual tumor types or tumors occurring 
with reduced latency may add to the weight 
of evidence for the carcinogenic potential of 
a substance, even if the tumors are not 
statistically significant. 
Toxicokinetic behaviour is normally 
assumed to be similar in animals and 
humans, at least from a qualitative 
perspective. On the other hand, certain tumor 
types in animals may be associated with 
toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics that are 
unique to the animal species tested and may 
not be predictive of carcinogenicity in 
humans. Very few such examples have been 
agreed internationally. However, one 
example is the lack of human relevance of 
kidney tumors in male rats associated with 
compounds causing a2u-globulin 
nephropathy (IARC, Scientific Publication N° 
147). Even when a particular tumor type may 
be discounted, expert judgment must be used 
in assessing the total tumor profile in any 
animal experiment.

chemical in accordance with the Hazard 
Communication Standard (29 CFR 
1910.1200). Appendices A and B of the 
Hazard Communication Standard 
provide criteria for classification of 
health hazards and physical hazards. 
Health hazard means a chemical that 
is classified as posing one of the 
following hazardous effects: acute 
toxicity (any route of exposure); skin 
corrosion or irritation; serious eye 
damage or eye irritation; respiratory or 
skin sensitization; germ cell 
mutagenicity; carcinogenity; 
reproductive toxicity; specific target 
organ toxicity (single or repeated 
exposure); or aspiration hazard. The 
criteria for determining whether a 
chemical is classified as a health hazard 
are detailed in Appendix A of the 
Hazard Communication Standard (29 
CFR 1910.1200).
