[Docket Number EE–2006–BT–STD–0129] 
RIN 1904–AA90 
Energy Conservation Program: Energy 
Conservation Standards for 
Residential Water Heaters, Direct 
Heating Equipment, and Pool Heaters 
AGENCY: Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy, Department of 
Energy. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking 
and public meeting. 
SUMMARY: The Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act (EPCA) prescribes 
energy conservation standards for 
various consumer products and 
commercial and industrial equipment, 
including residential water heaters, 
direct heating equipment (DHE), and 
pool heaters. EPCA also requires the 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to 
determine whether more stringent, 
amended standards for these products 
would be technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and would save 
a significant amount of energy. In this 
notice, DOE is proposing amended 
energy conservation standards for 
residential water heaters (other than 
tabletop and electric instantaneous 
models), gas-fired DHE, and gas-fired 
pool heaters. DOE also is announcing a 
public meeting to receive comment on 
these proposed standards and associated 
analyses and results. 
DATES: DOE will hold a public meeting 
on Thursday, January 7, 2010, from 9 
a.m. to 4 p.m., in Washington, DC. DOE 
must receive requests to speak at the 
public meeting before 4 p.m., 
Wednesday, December 23, 2009. DOE 
must receive a signed original and an 
electronic copy of statements to be given 
at the public meeting before 4 p.m., 
Wednesday, December 30, 2009. 
DOE will accept comments, data, and 
information regarding this notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NOPR) before and 
after the public meeting, but no later 
than February 9, 2010. See section VII, 
‘‘Public Participation,’’ of this NOPR for

I. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
The Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 6291 et seq.; EPCA or the 
Act), as amended, provides that any 
new or amended energy conservation 
standard DOE prescribes for certain 
consumer products, including 
residential water heaters, direct heating 
equipment (DHE), and pool heaters 
(collectively referred to in this 
document as the ‘‘three heating 
products’’), shall be designed to 
‘‘achieve the maximum improvement in 
energy efficiency * * * which the 
Secretary determines is technologically 
feasible and economically justified.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A)) Furthermore, the 
new or amended standard must ‘‘result 
in significant conservation of energy.’’ 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) In accordance 
with these and other statutory 
provisions discussed in this notice, DOE 
proposes amended energy conservation 
standards for the three types of heating 
products listed above. Compliance with 
the proposed standards would be 
required for all residential water heaters 
listed in Table I.1 that are manufactured 
in or imported into the United States on 
or after five years after the date of 
publication of the final rule. The 
proposed standards would apply to all 
DHE and pool heaters listed in Table I.1 
that are manufactured in or imported 
into the United States on or after three 
years after the date of publication of the 
final rule. Table I.1 sets forth the 
proposed standards for the products that 
are the subject of this rulemaking.

Pool heaters 
Gas-fired ......................................................................................................................................................................... Thermal Efficiency = 84% 
* EF is the ‘‘energy factor,’’ and the ‘‘Rated Storage Volume’’ equals the water storage capacity of a water heater (in gallons), as specified by 
the manufacturer. 
** Btu/h is ‘‘British thermal units per hour’’ and AFUE is ‘‘Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency.’’ 
DOE’s analyses indicate that the 
proposed standards would save a 
significant amount of energy—an 
estimated 2.85 quads of cumulative 
energy over a 30-year period. This 
amount is equivalent to 61 days of U.S. 
gasoline use. Breaking these figures 
down by product type, the national 
energy savings of the proposed 
standards is estimated to be 2.60 quads 
for residential water heaters, 0.22 quads 
for DHE, and 0.03 quads for pool 
heaters. 
The cumulative national net present 
value (NPV) of total consumer costs and 
savings from the proposed standards (in 
2008$) ranges from $5.73 billion (at 7- 
percent discount rate) to $18.1 billion 
(at 3-percent discount rate). This is the 
estimated total value of future 
operating-cost savings minus the 
estimated increased product and 
installation costs, discounted to 2010. 
The NPV of the proposed standards 
for water heaters ranges from $4.79 
billion (7-percent discount rate) to $15.6 
billion (3-percent discount rate). DOE 
estimates the industry net present value 
(INPV) for water heaters to be 
approximately $1,455 million in 2008$. 
If DOE adopts the proposed standards, 
it estimates U.S. water heater 
manufacturers will lose between 0.2 
percent and 5.6 percent of the INPV, 
which is approximately ¥$2.4 to 
¥$81.0 million. However, the NPV for 
consumers (at the 7-percent discount 
rate) is 59 to 1996 times larger than the 
industry losses due to the proposed 
standards with the 7-percent discount 
rate, and 193 to 6500 times larger than 
the industry losses due to the proposed 
standards with the 3-percent discount 
rate. 
For DHE, the NPV of the proposed 
standards ranges from $0.91 billion (7- 
percent discount rate) to $2.22 billion 
(3-percent discount rate). DOE estimates 
the INPV for DHE to be approximately 
$104 million in 2008$. If DOE adopts 
the proposed standards, it estimates 
U.S. DHE manufacturers will lose 
between 1.9 percent and 5.9 percent of 
the INPV, which is approximately 
¥$2.0 to ¥$6.2 million. However, the 
NPV for consumers (at the 7-percent 
discount rate) is 147 to 455 times larger 
than the industry losses due to the 
proposed standards with the 7-percent 
discount rate, and 358 to 1,110 times 
larger than the industry losses due to 
the proposed standards with the 3- 
percent discount rate. 
For pool heaters, the NPV of the 
proposed standard ranges from $0.03 
billion (7-percent discount rate) to $0.25 
billion (3-percent discount rate). DOE 
estimates the INPV for pool heaters to be 
approximately $61.4 million in 2008$. If 
DOE adopts the proposed standards, it 
expects the impacts on U.S. pool heater 
manufacturers will be between a gain of 
0.9 percent and a loss of 12.1 percent of 
the INPV, which is approximately 
¥$0.5 million to ¥$7.5 million. 
However, the NPV for consumers (at the 
seven-percent discount rate) is 4 to 60 
times larger than the industry losses due 
to the proposed standards at the 7- 
percent discount rate, and 33 to 498 
times larger than the industry losses due

to the proposed standards at the 3- 
percent discount rate. 
The economic impacts of the 
proposed standards on individual 
consumers (i.e., the average life-cycle 
cost (LCC) savings) are predominately 
positive. For water heaters, DOE 
projects that the average LCC impact is 
a gain of $68 for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, $39 for electric storage water 
heaters, and $395 for oil-fired storage 
water heaters, and no change for gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters. For 
DHE, DOE projects that the average LCC 
impact for consumers is a gain of $104 
for gas wall fan DHE, $192 for gas wall 
gravity DHE, $13 for gas floor DHE, $143 
for gas room DHE, and $96 for gas 
hearth DHE. For pool heaters, DOE 
projects that the average LCC impact for 
consumers is a loss of $13 (which 
represents only 0.2 percent of the 
average total LCC). 
In addition, the proposed standards 
would be expected to provide 
significant environmental benefits. The 
proposed standards would potentially 
result in cumulative greenhouse gas 
emission reductions of 167 million tons 
(Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) from 2013 
to 2045. Specifically, the proposed 
standards for water heaters would 
reduce CO2 emissions by 154 Mt; the 
proposed standards for DHE would 
reduce CO2 emissions by 8.5 Mt; and the 
proposed standard for pool heaters 
would reduce CO2 emissions by 4.2 Mt. 
For the three types of heating products 
together, DOE estimates that the range of 
the monetized value of CO2 emission 
reductions based on global estimates of 
the value of avoided CO2 is $0.399 
billion to $4.386 billion at a 7-percent 
discount rate and $0.902 billion to 
$9.925 billion at a 3-percent discount 
rate. 
The proposed standards would also 
be expected to result in reduction in 
cumulative nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
emissions of 129 kilotons (kt). 
Specifically, the proposed water heater 
standards would result in cumulative 
NOX emissions reductions of 118 kt; the 
proposed standards for DHE would 
result in 7.7 kt of NOX emissions 
reductions; and the proposed standard 
for pool heaters would result in 3.7 kt 
of NOX emissions reductions. 
The proposed standards for heating 
products would also be expected to 
result in power plant mercury (Hg) 
emissions reductions. For water heaters, 
cumulative Hg emissions would be 
reduced by 0.20 tons (t). The proposed 
standards for DHE and pool heaters 
would be expected to have a negligible 
impact on mercury emissions. 
The benefits and costs of today’s 
proposed rule can also be expressed in 
terms of annualized values. The 
annualized values refer to consumer 
operating cost savings, consumer 
incremental product and installation 
costs, the quantity of emissions 
reductions for CO2, NOX, and Hg, and 
the monetary value of emissions 
reductions. DOE calculated annualized 
values using discount rates of three 
percent and seven percent. Although 
DOE calculated annualized values, this 
does not imply that the time-series of 
cost and benefits from which the 
annualized values were determined are 
a steady stream of payments. 
Table I.2, Table I.3, and Table I.4 
present the annualized values for the 
standards proposed for water heaters, 
DHE, and pool heaters, respectively. 
The tables also present the annualized 
net benefit that results from summing 
the two monetary benefits and 
subtracting the consumer incremental 
product and installation costs. Although 
summing the value of operating cost 
savings with the value of CO2 
reductions (and other emissions 
reductions) provides a valuable 
perspective, please note the following. 
The operating cost savings are domestic 
U.S. consumer monetary savings found 
in market transactions, but in contrast, 
the CO2 value is based on an estimate 
of imputed marginal social cost of 
carbon (SCC), which is meant to reflect 
the global benefits of CO2 reductions. In 
addition, the assessments of operating 
cost savings and CO2 savings are 
performed with different computer 
models, leading to different time frames 
for analysis. The operating cost savings 
are measured for the lifetime of 
appliances shipped in 2015–2045 or 
2013–2043. The value of CO2, on the 
other hand is meant to reflect the 
present value of all future climate- 
related impacts, even those beyond 
2065.

DOE has tentatively concluded that 
the proposed standards represent the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified, and 
would result in significant conservation 
of energy. Products achieving these 
standard levels are already 
commercially available. Based on the 
analyses culminating in this proposal, 
DOE found the benefits to the Nation of 
the proposed standards (energy savings, 
consumer LCC savings, national NPV 
increase, and emission reductions) 
outweigh the burdens (loss of INPV and 
LCC increases for some consumers). 
DOE considered higher efficiency levels 
as trial standard levels, and is still 
considering them in this rulemaking; 
however, DOE has tentatively 
concluded that the burdens of the 
higher efficiency levels would outweigh 
the benefits. With that said, based on 
consideration of public comments DOE 
receives in response to this notice and 
related information, DOE may adopt 
efficiency levels in the final rule that are 
either higher or lower than the proposed 
standards, or some level(s) in between 
the proposed standards and other 
efficiency levels presented. 
DOE is proposing TSL 4 for 
residential water heaters as the level 
which it has tentatively concluded meet 
the applicable statutory criteria (i.e., the 
highest level that is technologically 
feasible, economically justified, and 
would result in significant conservation 
of energy). Based upon public 
comments and any accompanying data 
submissions, DOE would strongly 
consider other TSLs (as presented in 
this NOPR or at some level in between), 
some of which might provide an even 
higher level of energy savings and 
promote a market for advanced water 
heating technologies, including heat 
pump and condensing water heaters. 
Accordingly, DOE is presenting a 
variety of issues throughout today’s 
notice upon which it is seeking

editorial reasons. 
comment which will bear upon its 
consideration of TSL 5 or TSL 6 for 
residential water heaters in the final 
rule. 
II. Introduction 
A. Consumer Overview 
EPCA currently prescribes energy 
conservation standards for the three 
heating products that are the subject of 
this rulemaking. DOE is proposing to 
raise the standards for the products 
shown in Table I.1. The proposed 
standards would apply to residential 
water heaters manufactured or imported 
on or after five years after the final rule 
publication date (i.e., approximately 
March 31, 2015). The proposed 
standards would apply to DHE and pool 
heaters manufactured or imported on or 
after three years after the final rule 
publication date (i.e., approximately 
March 31, 2013). 
DOE’s analyses suggest that 
consumers would realize benefits from 
the proposed standards. Although DOE 
expects that the purchase price of the 
more-efficient heating products would 
be higher than the average prices of 
these products today, for most 
consumers, the energy efficiency gains 
would result in lower energy costs that 
would more than offset the higher 
purchase price. For water heaters, the 
median payback period is 2.7 years for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, 5.8 years 
for electric storage water heaters, 0.5 
years for oil-fired storage water heaters, 
and 23.5 years for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. For DHE, 
the median payback period is 6.0 years 
for gas wall fan DHE, 8.3 years for gas 
wall gravity DHE, 14.7 years for gas 
floor DHE, 5.3 years for gas room DHE 
and 0.0 years for gas hearth DHE. (The 
reason that the median payback period 
for gas hearth DHE is zero is because for 
about two-thirds of the consumers, there 
is no incremental cost to get to the 
proposed standard level). For pool 
heaters, the median payback period is 
13.0 years. 
When the overall net savings are 
summed over the lifetime of these 
products, water heater consumers will 
save, on average, $68 for gas-fired 
storage water heaters, $30 for electric 
storage water heaters, $305 for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and $0 for gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters, 
compared to their life-cycle 
expenditures on base-case water heaters 
(i.e., the equipment expected to be 
purchased in the absence of revised 
energy conservation standards). (For 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters, 
the average LCC for the proposed 
standard level is the same as the average 
LCC in the base case, so the savings are 
zero.) The average LCC impact for DHE 
consumers is a gain of $104 for gas wall 
fan DHE, $192 for gas wall gravity DHE, 
$13 for gas floor DHE, $143 for gas room 
DHE, and $96 for gas hearth DHE, 
compared to their life-cycle 
expenditures on base-case products. 
Pool heater consumers will see, on 
average, a slight increase in their life- 
cycle costs, compared to their 
expenditures on base-case products. 
B. Authority 
Title III of EPCA sets forth a variety 
of provisions designed to improve 
energy efficiency. Part A 1 of Title III (42 
U.S.C. 6291–6309) establishes the 
Energy Conservation Program for 
Consumer Products Other Than 
Automobiles. The program covers 
consumer products and certain 
commercial equipment (referred to 
hereafter as ‘‘covered products’’), 
including the three types of heating 
products that are subject to this 
rulemaking. (42 U.S.C. 6292(a)(4), (9) 
and (11)) EPCA prescribes energy 
conservation standards for the three 
heating products. (42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(1)– 
(3)) The statute further directs DOE to 
conduct two cycles of rulemakings to 
determine whether to amend these 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4)) As 
explained in further detail in section 
II.C, ‘‘Background,’’ this rulemaking 
represents the second round of 
amendments to the water heater 
standards, and the first round of 
amendments to the DHE and pool heater 
standards. 
Under the Act, DOE’s energy 
conservation program for covered 
products consists essentially of three 
parts: (1) Testing; (2) labeling; and (3) 
Federal energy conservation standards. 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is 
responsible for the labeling provisions 
for consumer products, and DOE 
implements the remainder of the 
program. Section 323 of the Act 
authorizes DOE, subject to certain 
criteria and conditions, to develop test 
procedures to measure the energy 
efficiency, energy use, or estimated 
annual operating cost of each covered 
product. Manufacturers of covered 
products must use the DOE test 
procedure as the basis for certifying to 
DOE that their products comply with 
applicable energy conservation 
standards adopted under EPCA and for 
representing the efficiency of those 
products. Similarly, DOE must use these 
test procedures to determine whether 
the products comply with standards 
adopted under EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6293) 
The test procedures for water heaters, 
unvented DHE, vented DHE, and pool 
heaters appear at Title 10 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) part 430, 
subpart B, appendices E, G, O, and P, 
respectively. 
EPCA provides criteria for prescribing 
amended standards for covered 
products. As indicated above, any 
amended standard for a covered product 
must be designed to achieve the 
maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that is technologically 
feasible and economically justified. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A)) Furthermore, 
EPCA precludes DOE from adopting any 
standard that would not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) Moreover, DOE 
may not prescribe a standard for certain 
products (including the three heating 
products) if no test procedure has been 
established. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(A)) 
The Act also provides that, in deciding 
whether a standard is economically 
justified, DOE must determine whether 
the benefits of the standard exceed its 
burdens. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) 
DOE must do so after receiving 
comments on the proposed standard 
and by considering, to the greatest 
extent practicable, the following seven 
factors: 
1. The economic impact of the 
standard on manufacturers and 
consumers of the products subject to the 
standard; 
2. The savings in operating costs 
throughout the estimated average life of 
the covered products in the type (or 
class) compared to any increase in the 
price, initial charges, or maintenance 
expenses for the covered products that 
are likely to result from the imposition 
of the standard; 
3. The total projected amount of 
energy (or, as applicable, water) savings 
likely to result directly from the 
imposition of the standard; 
4. Any lessening of the utility or the 
performance of the covered products 
likely to result from the imposition of 
the standard; 
5. The impact of any lessening of 
competition, as determined in writing 
by the Attorney General, that is likely to 
result from the imposition of the 
standard; 
6. The need for national energy and 
water conservation; and 
7. Other factors the Secretary 
considers relevant. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(I)–(VII)) 
Furthermore, EPCA contains what is 
commonly known as an ‘‘anti- 
backsliding’’ provision, which prohibits

the Secretary from prescribing any 
amended standard that either increases 
the maximum allowable energy use or 
decreases the minimum required energy 
efficiency of a covered product. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(1)) Also, the Secretary 
may not prescribe a new or amended 
standard if interested persons have 
established by a preponderance of the 
evidence that the standard is likely to 
result in the unavailability in the United 
States of any covered product type (or 
class) with performance characteristics 
(including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as those generally 
available in the United States. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(4)) 
Under 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii), 
EPCA establishes a rebuttable 
presumption that a standard is 
economically justified if the Secretary 
finds that ‘‘the additional cost to the 
consumer of purchasing a product 
complying with an energy conservation 
standard level will be less than three 
times the value of the energy * * * 
savings during the first year that the 
consumer will receive as a result of the 
standard, as calculated under the 
applicable test procedure. * * *’’ 
Under 42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(1), EPCA 
specifies requirements for promulgation 
of a standard for a type or class of 
covered product that has two or more 
subcategories. DOE must specify a 
different standard level than that which 
applies generally to such type or class 
of products ‘‘for any group of covered 
products which have the same function 
or intended use, if * * * products 
within such group—(A) consume a 
different kind of energy from that 
consumed by other covered products 
within such type (or class); or (B) have 
a capacity or other performance-related 
feature which other products within 
such type (or class) do not have and 
such feature justifies a higher or lower 
standard’’ than applies or will apply to 
the other products. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(q)(1)) In determining whether a 
performance-related feature justifies a 
different standard for a group of 
products, DOE must ‘‘consider such 
factors as the utility to the consumer of 
such a feature’’ and other factors DOE 
deems appropriate. Id. Any rule 
prescribing such a standard must 
include an explanation of the basis on 
which such higher or lower level was 
established. (42 U.S.C. 6295(q)(2)) 
Federal energy conservation 
requirements generally supersede State 
laws or regulations concerning energy 
conservation testing, labeling, and 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6297(a)–(c)) 
However, DOE can grant waivers of 
Federal preemption for particular State 
laws or regulations in accordance with 
the procedures and other provisions of 
section 327(d) of the Act. (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d)) 
Finally, section 310(3) of the Energy 
Independence and Security Act of 2007 
(EISA 2007; Pub. L. 110–140) amended 
EPCA to prospectively require that 
energy conservation standards address 
standby mode and off mode energy use. 
Specifically, when DOE adopts new or 
amended standards for a covered 
product after July 1, 2010, the final rule 
must, if justified by the criteria for 
adoption of standards in section 325(o) 
of EPCA, incorporate standby mode and 
off mode energy use into a single 
standard if feasible, or otherwise adopt 
a separate standard for such energy use 
for that product. (42 U.S.C. 6295(gg)(3)) 
Because the final rule in this rulemaking 
is scheduled for adoption by March 
2010, this requirement does not apply in 
this rulemaking, and DOE has not 
attempted to address the standby mode 
or off mode energy use here. DOE is 
currently working on a test procedure 
rulemaking to address standby mode 
and off mode energy consumption for 
the three types of heating products that 
are the subject of this rulemaking. 
C. Background 
1. Current Standards 
a. Water Heaters 
On January 17, 2001, DOE prescribed 
the current energy conservation 
standards for residential water heaters 
manufactured on or after January 20, 
2004. 66 FR 4474. This final rule 
completed the first amended standards 
rulemaking for water heaters required 
under 42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4)(A). The 
standards consist of minimum energy 
factors (EF) that vary based on the 
storage volume of the water heater, the 
type of energy it uses (i.e., gas, oil, or 
electricity), and whether it is a storage, 
instantaneous, or tabletop model. 10 
CFR 430.32(d). The water heater energy 
conservation standards are set forth in 
Table II.1 below. 
TABLE II.1—CURRENT FEDERAL ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS FOR RESIDENTIAL WATER HEATERS 
Product class Energy factor as of January 20, 2004 
1. Gas-Fired Storage Water Heater ......................................................... EF = 0.67 ¥ (0.0019 × Rated Storage Volume in gallons). 
2. Oil-Fired Storage Water Heater ........................................................... EF = 0.59 ¥ (0.0019 × Rated Storage Volume in gallons). 
3. Electric Storage Water Heater ............................................................. EF = 0.97 ¥ (0.00132 × Rated Storage Volume in gallons). 
4. Tabletop Water Heater ......................................................................... EF = 0.93 ¥ (0.00132 × Rated Storage Volume in gallons). 
5. Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heater ............................................... EF = 0.62 ¥ (0.0019 × Rated Storage Volume in gallons). 
6. Instantaneous Electric Water Heater ................................................... EF = 0.93 ¥ (0.00132 × Rated Storage Volume in gallons). 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
EPCA prescribes the energy 
conservation standards for DHE, which 
apply to gas-fired products 
manufactured on or after January 1, 
1990. (42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(3)) These 
standards consist of several minimum 
annual fuel utilization efficiency 
(AFUE) levels, each of which applies to 
units of a particular type (i.e., wall fan, 
wall gravity, floor, room) and heating 
capacity range. Id. These statutory 
standards have been codified in DOE’s 
regulations at 10 CFR 430.32(i). The 
DHE energy conservation standards are 
set forth in Table II.2 below. DOE notes 
that while electric DHE are available, 
standards for these products are outside 
the scope of today’s rulemaking. See 
IV.A.1.b for a more detailed discussion 
of DHE coverage under EPCA.

c. Pool Heaters 
EPCA requires pool heaters 
manufactured on or after January 1, 
1990 to have a thermal efficiency no less 
than 78 percent. The thermal efficiency 
for this product is measured by testing 
in accordance with the DOE test 
procedure for pool heaters codified in 
10 CFR 430, subpart B, Appendix P. The 
statutory standard for pool heaters has 
been codified in DOE’s regulations at 10 
CFR 430.32(k). 
2. History of Standards Rulemaking for 
Water Heaters, Direct Heating 
Equipment, and Pool Heaters 
Before being amended by the National 
Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 
1987 (NAECA; Pub. L. 100–12), Title III 
of EPCA included water heaters and 
home heating equipment as covered 
products. NAECA’s amendments to 
EPCA included replacing the term 
‘‘home heating equipment’’ with ‘‘direct 
heating equipment,’’ adding pool 
heaters as a covered product, 
establishing energy conservation 
standards for these two products as well 
as residential water heaters, and 
requiring that DOE determine whether 
these standards should be amended. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(e)(1)–(4)) As indicated 
above, DOE amended the statutorily- 
prescribed standards for water heaters 
in 2001 (66 FR 4474 (Jan. 17, 2001)), but 
has not amended the statutory standards 
for DHE or pool heaters. 
DOE initiated this rulemaking on 
September 27, 2006, by publishing on 
its Web site its ‘‘Rulemaking Framework 
for Residential Water Heaters, Direct 
Heating Equipment, and Pool Heaters.’’ 
(A PDF of the framework document is 
available at http://www.eere.energy.gov/ 
buildings/appliance_standards/
residential/pdfs/heating_equipment
framework_092706.pdf.) DOE also 
published a notice announcing the 
availability of the framework document 
and a public meeting and requesting 
comments on the matters raised in the 
document. 71 FR 67825 (Nov. 24, 2006). 
The framework document described the 
procedural and analytical approaches 
that DOE anticipated using to evaluate 
potential energy conservation standards 
for the three heating products and 
identified various issues to be resolved 
in conducting the rulemaking. 
DOE held the public meeting on 
January 16, 2007, where it: Presented 
the contents of the framework 
document; described the analyses it 
planned to conduct during the 
rulemaking; sought comments from 
interested parties on these subjects; and 
in general, sought to inform interested 
parties about, and facilitate their 
involvement in, the rulemaking. 
Interested parties that participated in 
the public meeting discussed the 
following issues: the scope of coverage 
for the rulemaking; product classes; 
efficiency levels analyzed in the 
engineering analysis; installation, 
repair, and maintenance costs; and 
product and fuel switching. At the 
meeting and during the public comment 
period, DOE received many comments 
that helped DOE identify and resolve 
the issues involved in this rulemaking 
to consider amended energy 
conservation standards for the three 
types of heating products. 
DOE then gathered additional 
information and performed preliminary 
analyses to help develop the potential 
energy conservation standards for the 
three heating products. This process 
culminated in DOE’s announcement of 
another public meeting to discuss and 
receive comments on the following 
matters: The product classes DOE 
planned to analyze; the analytical 
framework, models, and tools that DOE 
has been using to evaluate standards; 
the results of the preliminary analyses 
DOE performed; and potential standard 
levels that DOE could consider. 74 FR 
1643 (Jan. 13, 2009) (the January 2009 
notice). DOE also invited written 
comments on these subjects and 
announced the availability of a 
preliminary technical support document 
(preliminary TSD) to inform interested 
parties and enable them to provide 
comments. Id. (The preliminary TSD is 
available at: http://
www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/
appliance_standards/residential/water_
pool_heaters_prelim_tsd.html.) DOE 
stated its interest in receiving comments 
on other relevant issues that 
participants believe DOE should address 
in this NOPR, which would affect 
energy conservation standards for the 
three heating products. Id. at 1646. 
The preliminary TSD provided an 
overview of the activities DOE 
undertook in developing potential 
standard levels for the three heating 
products and discussed the comments 
DOE received in response to the 
framework document. It also described 
the analytical framework that DOE used 
(and continues to use in this 
rulemaking), including a description of 
the methodology, the analytical tools, 
and the relationships among the various 
analyses that are part of the rulemaking. 
The preliminary TSD described in detail 
each analysis DOE performed up to that 
point, including inputs, sources,

2 ‘‘EEI, No. 40 at p. 5’’ refers to: (1) To a statement 
that was submitted by the Edison Electric Institute. 
It was recorded in the Resource Room of the 
Building Technologies Program in the docket under 
‘‘Energy Conservation Program: Energy 
Conservation Standards for Residential Water 
Heaters, Direct Heating Equipment, and Pool 
Heaters,’’ Docket Number EERE–2006–BT–STD– 
0129, as comment number 40; and (2) a passage that 
appears on page 5 of that statement. 
methodologies, and results. DOE 
examined each of the three heating 
products in each of the following 
analyses: 
• A market and technology 
assessment addressed the scope of this 
rulemaking (i.e., which types of heating 
products this rulemaking covers), 
identified the potential classes for each 
product, characterized the markets for 
these products, and reviewed 
techniques and approaches for 
improving product efficiency. 
• A screening analysis reviewed 
technology options to improve the 
efficiency of each of the three heating 
products and weighed these options 
against DOE’s four prescribed screening 
criteria (i.e., technological feasibility; 
practicability to manufacture, install, 
and service; adverse impacts on product 
utility or product availability; and 
adverse impacts on health or safety). 
• An engineering analysis estimated 
the manufacturer selling prices (MSPs) 
associated with more efficient water 
heaters, DHE, and pool heaters. 
• An energy use analysis estimated 
the annual energy use in the field of 
each of the three heating products. 
• A markups analysis developed 
factors to convert estimated MSPs 
derived from the engineering analysis to 
consumer prices. 
• A life-cycle cost analysis calculated, 
at the consumer level, the discounted 
savings in operating costs throughout 
the estimated average life of the product 
compared to any increase in installed 
costs likely to result directly from a 
given standard. 
• A payback period (PBP) analysis 
estimated the amount of time it takes 
consumers to recover the higher 
purchase expense of more energy 
efficient products through lower 
operating costs. 
• A shipments analysis estimated 
shipments of each of the three heating 
products over the time period examined 
in the analysis (i.e., 2015–2045 for water 
heaters and 2013–2043 for DHE and 
pool heaters) under both a base-case 
scenario (i.e., assuming no new 
standards) and a standards-case scenario 
(i.e., assuming new standards at the 
various levels under consideration). The 
shipments analysis provides key inputs 
to the national impact analysis (NIA). 
• A national impact analysis assessed 
the aggregate impacts at the national 
level of potential energy conservation 
standards for each of the three heating 
products, as measured by the net 
present value of total consumer 
economic impacts and national energy 
savings. 
• A preliminary manufacturer impact 
analysis took the initial steps in 
evaluating the effects on manufacturers 
of potential new efficiency standards. 
In the January 2009 notice, DOE 
summarized in detail the nature and 
function of the following analyses: (1) 
Engineering, (2) energy use 
characterization, (3) markups to 
determine installed prices, (4) LCC and 
PBP analyses, and (5) national impact 
analysis. 74 FR 1643, 1645–46 (Jan. 13, 
2009). 
The public meeting announced in the 
January 2009 notice took place on 
February 9, 2009. At this meeting, DOE 
presented the methodologies and results 
of the analyses set forth in the 
preliminary TSD. The major topics 
discussed at the February 2009 public 
meeting included the product classes for 
the rulemaking, the treatment of ultra- 
low NOX water heaters, heat pump 
water heaters screening considerations, 
installation costs and concerns for heat 
pump water heaters, the manufacturing 
costs for max-tech products, pool heater 
shipments, the energy-use adjustment 
for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, and the compliance dates for 
amended standards. The comments 
received since publication of the 
January 2009 notice, including those 
received at the February 2009 public 
meeting, have contributed to DOE’s 
proposed resolution of the issues in this 
rulemaking. This NOPR quotes and 
summarizes many of these comments, 
and responds to the issues they raised. 
(A parenthetical reference at the end of 
a quotation or paraphrase provides the 
location of the relevant source in the 
public record.) 
III. General Discussion 
A. Test Procedures 
As noted above, DOE’s current test 
procedures for water heaters, vented 
DHE, and pool heaters appear at Title 10 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 
430, subpart B, appendices E, O, and P, 
respectively. DOE uses these test 
procedures to determine whether the 
products comply with standards 
adopted under EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6293) 
1. Water Heaters 
During the preliminary analysis, DOE 
received a number of comments on the 
test procedure for residential water 
heaters. Edison Electric Institute (EEI) 
stated that DOE should modify the 
values for hot water use and the number 
of daily draws in the water heater test 
procedure to more closely resemble 
field conditions (i.e., include more 
shorter draws, rather than fewer longer 
draws), and SEISCO INTERNATIONAL 
(SEISCO) recommended the adoption of 
a testing protocol for water heaters that 
can best simulate real world usage 
patterns. (EEI, No. 40 at p.5; SEISCO, 
No. 41 at p. 3) 2 Southern Company 
(Southern), Bock Water Heaters (Bock), 
and EEI all stated that DOE needs to 
revise the test procedure to account for 
the actual performance of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. (Southern, 
No. 50 at p. 2; Bock, No. 53 at p. 3; EEI, 
No. 40 at p. 5) 
DOE acknowledges that the actual hot 
water use and the number of daily 
draws seen in the field can vary greatly 
depending upon occupancy and 
consumer usage patterns for each type 
of water heater. DOE’s test procedure 
attempts to normalize the usage across 
fuel types by specifying a typical draw 
pattern and total hot water usage. DOE 
accounts for the variability of these 
parameters on the energy consumption 
of the water heater using: (1) A hot 
water draw model that accounts for field 
conditions in a representative sample of 
U.S. homes; and (2) data from field 
studies of gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters that incorporate a distribution of 
correction factors to account for actual 
field operation. These adjustments are 
used to estimate the impacts on 
consumers of amended standards in the 
LCC and PBP analysis. 
In the past, the issue of whether the 
efficiency levels examined by DOE in 
this NOPR are achievable using the 
current DOE test procedures for 
residential water heaters has received 
much attention from commenters. In 
particular, several manufacturers either 
through manufacturer interviews or 
docket submissions have expressed 
their concern that as efficiencies 
increase and approach the theoretical 
maximum efficiency for electric 
resistance water heating (i.e., 1.0 EF), 
the ability to consistently and 
repeatedly achieve those efficiencies is 
significantly hindered by the variations 
and inaccuracies that are inherent in the 
current DOE test procedure. During 
engineering and manufacturer 
interviews, manufacturers have 
indicated that this becomes an 
increasingly important issue at 0.95 EF. 
Rheem Manufacturing Company 
(Rheem) commented that the nature of 
the DOE test procedure, including test 
set-up variations, instrumentation, and 
measurement inaccuracies, limits the 
attainable energy factor values. Rheem

65861 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
stated that DOE should reevaluate the 
current test procedure to determine 
whether it can accurately measure the 
EF levels being proposed for standards, 
especially if a standard is set at or near 
the theoretically maximum-attainable 
EF. (Rheem, No. 49 at pp. 3–4) 
DOE agrees with Rheem’s assertion 
that as the theoretical limit is reached 
for a covered product utilizing a given 
technology (e.g., electric resistance 
storage water heaters), the limitations 
imposed by the instrumentation, test 
set-up, and measurement accuracies 
become increasingly important. In 
response, DOE notes that there are 
currently several models in AHRI’s 
Directory of certified residential water 
heaters that are listed with energy 
factors of 0.95 EF over a range of storage 
volumes. DOE believes this fact 
demonstrates that it is possible for 
manufacturers to make products that 
can repeatedly achieve an energy factor 
of 0.95 and can be certified at this 
efficiency level. In order to further 
verify the ability of manufacturers to 
achieve this efficiency level, DOE 
performed its own research, which 
consisted of independent third-party 
testing of several water heater models 
rated at 0.95 EF with rated storage 
volumes spanning 30 to 80 gallons. Of 
the five models tested that were rated at 
0.95 EF, four fell within the acceptable 
range of values to be rated and certified 
at 0.95 EF, while only one model failed 
to achieve an efficiency that would be 
acceptable for a 0.95 EF rating. This 
further demonstrates the ability of 
manufacturers to consistently achieve 
0.95 EF, as the large majority of the 
sample of models tested did reach an 
acceptable value for certification at 0.95 
EF. 
DOE has tentatively concluded that 
the TSLs being considering in the 
proposed rule provide ample room for 
manufacturers to innovatively design 
products which meet the standards 
using the existing test procedure. DOE’s 
test results further provide evidence that 
electric storage water heaters exist at 
TSL 4 (0.95 EF at the representative 
rated storage capacity) across a range of 
storage volumes in the market today. In 
addition, DOE notes that once the 
product surpasses the theoretical 
maximum of a given technology by 
utilizing a different design these 
problems are mitigated. Consequently, 
DOE does not believe commenter’s 
concerns regarding the repeatability and 
accuracy of the test procedure apply to 
TSL 6 and 7, where DOE is considering 
advance technology water heaters, 
including heat pump water heaters. 
The Natural Resources Defense 
Council (NRDC) stated that the water 
heater test procedure fails to capture all 
of the cost-effective efficiency measures; 
the American Council for an Energy- 
Efficient Economy (ACEEE) and NRDC 
both stated that due to test procedure 
flaws (e.g., giving no efficiency 
advantage for an insulated tank bottom), 
manufacturers are generally not willing 
to incorporate enhanced efficiency 
features because product costs are likely 
to rise without improving the rated 
energy efficiency. (NRDC, No. 48 at p. 
3; ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 4) DOE 
acknowledges that the current test 
procedure may not reflect recent 
advances in technology. DOE believes, 
however, that the test procedure 
provides satisfactory methods for 
measuring performance of the efficiency 
levels considered in this rulemaking. 
Furthermore, the design paths that can 
be used to achieve the considered 
efficiency levels are given appropriate 
credit by the test procedure. DOE 
believes that the appropriate time to 
address the concerns raised is during 
the next revision of DOE’s test 
procedure. 
2. Direct Heating Equipment 
The energy conservation standards set 
by EPCA for DHE are consistent with 
the energy efficiency metric described 
in the vented home heating equipment 
test procedure. On May 12, 1997, DOE 
published a final test procedure rule 
(the May 1997 final rule) in the Federal 
Register that amended the test 
procedures for DHE, particularly for 
vented home heating equipment. 62 FR 
26140. In this rulemaking, DOE 
proposes that this test procedure be 
applied to establish the efficiency of 
vented gas hearth DHE. 
3. Standby Mode and Off Mode Energy 
Consumption 
EPCA, as amended by EISA 2007 
requires DOE to amend the test 
procedures for the three types of heating 
products to include the standby mode 
and off mode energy consumption 
measurements. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(gg)(2)(B)(v)) Consistent with EISA 
2007’s statutory deadline for these 
changes, DOE intends to amend its test 
procedures to incorporate these 
measurements by March 31, 2010. DOE 
is handling standby mode and off mode 
energy use for the three heating 
products in a separate rulemaking. 
B. Technological Feasibility 
1. General 
In each energy conservation standards 
rulemaking, DOE conducts a screening 
analysis, which it bases on information 
it has gathered on all current technology 
options and prototype designs that 
could improve the efficiency of the 
products or equipment that are the 
subject of the rulemaking. As the first 
step in such analysis, DOE develops a 
list of design options for consideration 
in consultation with manufacturers, 
design engineers, and other interested 
parties. DOE then determines which of 
these means for improving efficiency are 
technologically feasible. DOE considers 
a design option to be technologically 
feasible if it is in use by the relevant 
industry or if research has progressed to 
the development of a working 
prototype. ‘‘Technologies incorporated 
in commercial products or in working 
prototypes will be considered 
technologically feasible.’’ 10 CFR 430, 
subpart C, appendix A, section 4(a)(4)(i). 
Once DOE has determined that 
particular design options are 
technologically feasible, it evaluates 
each design option in light of the 
following additional screening criteria: 
(1) Practicability to manufacture, install, 
or service; (2) adverse impacts on 
product utility or availability; and (3) 
adverse impacts on health or safety. 
Section IV.B of this notice discusses the 
results of the screening analysis for the 
three types of heating products, 
particularly the designs DOE 
considered, those it screened out, and 
those that are the basis for the efficiency 
levels in this rulemaking. For further 
details on the screening analysis for this 
rulemaking, see chapter 4 of the NOPR 
TSD. 
2. Maximum Technologically Feasible 
Levels 
When DOE proposes to adopt (or not 
adopt) an amended or new energy 
conservation standard for a type or class 
of covered product, it must ‘‘determine 
the maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency or maximum reduction in 
energy use that is technologically 
feasible’’ for such product. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(p)(1)) Accordingly, DOE 
determined the maximum 
technologically feasible (‘‘max-tech’’) 
efficiency levels for the three heating 
products in the engineering analysis 
using the most efficient design 
parameters that lead to the creation of 
the highest product efficiencies 
possible. (See chapter 5 of the NOPR 
TSD.) 
The max-tech efficiency levels are set 
forth in TSL 7 for residential water 
heaters, TSL 6 for DHE, and TSL 6 for 
pool heaters. For the representative 
rated storage volumes and input 
capacity ratings within a given product 
class, products with these efficiency 
levels were or are now being offered for 
sale, or there is a prototype that has

been tested and developed. No products 
at higher efficiency levels are currently 
available. Table III.1 lists the max-tech 
efficiency levels that DOE determined 
for this rulemaking.

See section IV.C.3 for additional 
details of the max-tech efficiency levels 
and discussion of related comments 
from interested parties on the 
preliminary analysis. In this NOPR, 
DOE again seeks public comment on the 
max-tech efficiency levels identified for 
its analyses. Specifically, DOE requests 
information about whether the 
efficiency levels identified by DOE 
would be achievable using the 
technologies screened-in during the 
screening analysis (see section IV.B), 
especially for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, and whether even higher 
efficiencies would be achievable using 
screened-in technologies. (See Issue 1 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
C. Energy Savings 
1. Determination of Savings 
DOE used its NIA spreadsheet to 
estimate energy savings expected to 
result from amended energy 
conservation standards for products that 
would be covered under today’s 
proposed rule. (Section IV.F of this 
notice and chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD 
describe the NIA spreadsheet model.) 
For each TSL, DOE forecasted energy 
savings over the period of analysis 
(beginning in 2013 (DHE, pool heaters) 
or 2015 (water heaters), the year that 
compliance with the amended standards 
would be required, and ending 30 years 
later) relative to the base case. (The base 
case represents the forecast of energy 
consumption in the absence of amended 
energy conservation standards.) Stated 
another way, DOE quantified the energy 
savings attributable to potential 
amended energy conservation standards 
as the difference in energy consumption 
between the standards case and the base 
case. 
The NIA spreadsheet model calculates 
the energy savings in site energy, which 
is the energy directly consumed on 
location by an individual product. DOE 
reports national energy savings on an 
annual basis in terms of the aggregated 
source (primary) energy savings, which 
are the energy savings used to generate 
and transmit the energy consumed at 
the site. To convert site energy to source 
energy, DOE derived conversion factors, 
which change with time, from the 
Energy Information Agency’s (EIA) 
Annual Energy Outlook 2009 
(AEO2009). 
For results of DOE’s National Energy 
Savings (NES) analysis, see section 
V.B.3 of this notice or chapter 10 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
2. Significance of Savings 
As noted above, under 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)(B), DOE is prohibited from 
adopting a standard for a covered 
product if such standard would not 
result in ‘‘significant’’ energy savings. 
While the term ‘‘significant’’ is not 
defined in the Act, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit, in Natural Resources Defense 
Council v. Herrington, 768 F.2d 1355, 
1373 (D.C. Cir. 1985), indicated that 
Congress intended ‘‘significant’’ energy 
savings in this context to be savings that 
were not ‘‘genuinely trivial.’’ The energy 
savings for all of the TSLs considered in 
this rulemaking are nontrivial, and, 
therefore, DOE considers them 
‘‘significant’’ within the meaning of 
section 325 of the EPCA. 
D. Economic Justification 
1. Specific Criteria 
As noted in section II.B., EPCA 
provides seven factors to be evaluated in 
determining whether a potential energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) The 
following sections discuss how DOE has 
addressed each of those seven factors in 
this rulemaking. 
a. Economic Impact on Manufacturers 
and Consumers 
EPCA requires DOE to consider the 
economic impact on manufacturers and 
consumers of products when 
determining the economic justification 
of a standard. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(I)) In determining the 
impacts of an amended standard on 
manufacturers, DOE first determines the 
quantitative impacts using an annual 
cash-flow approach. This includes both 
a short-term assessment—based on the 
cost and capital requirements during the 
period between the announcement of a 
regulation and when the regulation 
comes into effect—and a long-term

assessment over the 30-year analysis 
period. The impacts analyzed include 
INPV (which values the industry on the 
basis of expected future cash flows), 
annual cash flows, changes in revenue 
and income, and other measures of 
impact, as appropriate. DOE analyzes 
and reports the impacts on different 
types of manufacturers, paying 
particular attention to impacts on small 
manufacturers. DOE also considers the 
impact of standards on domestic 
manufacturer employment and 
manufacturing capacity, as well as the 
potential for plant closures and loss of 
capital investment. Finally, DOE 
accounts for cumulative impacts of 
different DOE regulations and other 
regulatory requirements on 
manufacturers. 
For consumers, measures of economic 
impact include the changes in LCC and 
PBP for each TSL. The LCC, which is 
also separately specified as one of the 
seven factors to be considered in 
determining the economic justification 
for a new or amended standard (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(II)), is discussed 
in the following section. 
For the results of DOE’s analysis of 
the economic impacts of potential 
standards on manufacturers and 
consumers, see section V.B of this 
notice and chapters 8 and 12 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
b. Life-Cycle Costs 
The LCC is the sum of the purchase 
price of a product (including associated 
installation costs) and the operating 
expense (including energy, 
maintenance, and repair expenditures) 
discounted over the lifetime of the 
product. In this rulemaking, DOE 
calculated both LCC and LCC savings 
for various efficiency levels for each 
product. The LCC analysis estimated the 
LCC for representative heating products 
in housing units that represent the 
segment of the U.S. housing stock that 
uses these appliances. Through the use 
of a housing stock sample, DOE 
determined for each household in the 
sample the energy consumption of the 
heating product and the appropriate 
energy prices. By using a representative 
sample of households, the analysis 
captured the wide variability in energy 
consumption and energy prices 
associated with heating product use. For 
each household, DOE sampled the 
values of several inputs to the LCC 
calculation from probability 
distributions. For purposes of the 
analysis, DOE assumes that the 
consumer purchases the product in the 
year the standard becomes effective. 
DOE presents the LCC savings as a 
distribution, with a mean value and a 
range across the sample for each 
product. This approach permits DOE to 
identify the percentage of consumers 
achieving LCC savings or attaining 
certain payback values due to an 
amended energy conservation standard, 
in addition to the average LCC savings 
or average payback for that standard. 
For the results of DOE’s LCC and PBP 
analyses, see section V.B.1.a of this 
notice and chapter 8 of the NOPR TSD. 
c. Energy Savings 
While significant conservation of 
energy is a separate statutory 
requirement for adopting an energy 
conservation standard, the Act requires 
DOE, in determining the economic 
justification of a standard, to consider 
the total projected energy savings that 
are expected to result directly from the 
standard. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(III)) 
DOE used the NES spreadsheet results 
in its consideration of total projected 
savings. 
For the results of DOE’s energy 
savings analyses, see section V.B.3.a of 
this notice and chapter 10 of the NOPR 
TSD. 
d. Lessening of Utility or Performance of 
Products 
In establishing product classes and 
evaluating their potential for improved 
energy efficiency, DOE sought to 
develop potential standards for the three 
types of heating products that would not 
lessen the utility or performance of 
these products. During the screening 
analysis, DOE tentatively concluded 
that the efficiency levels being 
considered would not necessitate 
changes in product design that would 
reduce utility or performance of the 
three types of heating products that are 
the subject of this rulemaking. 
Therefore, none of the TSLs presented 
in today’s NOPR would reduce the 
utility or performance of the products 
under consideration. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV)) 
For the results of DOE’s analyses 
related to the impact of potential 
standards on product utility and 
performance, see section IV.B of this 
notice and chapter 4 of the NOPR TSD, 
the screening analysis. 
e. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 
EPCA directs DOE to consider any 
lessening of competition likely to result 
from standards. It directs the Attorney 
General to determine the impact, if any, 
of any lessening of competition likely to 
result from a proposed standard and to 
transmit such determination to the 
Secretary, not later than 60 days after 
the publication of a proposed rule, 
together with an analysis of the nature 
and extent of such impact. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and (B)(ii)) DOE has 
transmitted a copy of today’s proposed 
rule to the Attorney General and has 
requested that the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ) provide its determination 
on this issue. DOE will publish and 
address the Attorney General’s 
determination in the final rule. 
f. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 
EPCA directs DOE to consider the 
need for national energy and water 
conservation as part of its standard- 
setting process. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI)) DOE has 
preliminarily determined that the non- 
monetary benefits of the proposed 
standards would likely be reflected in 
improvements to the security and 
reliability of the Nation’s energy system. 
Reductions in the demand for electricity 
may result in reduced costs for 
maintaining reliability of the Nation’s 
electricity system. DOE conducts a 
utility impact analysis to estimate how 
standards may affect the Nation’s power 
generation capacity requirements. 
Energy savings from the proposed 
standards would also be likely to result 
in environmental benefits in the form of 
reduced emissions of air pollutants and 
greenhouse gases associated with energy 
production, and through reduced use of 
fossil fuels at the homes where heating 
products are used. Although presented 
in summary form in section IV.K, DOE 
reports the environmental effects from 
the proposed standards and all of the 
considered TSLs in the environmental 
assessment contained in chapter 15 of 
the NOPR TSD. DOE also reports 
estimates of the economic value of 
emissions reductions resulting from the 
considered TSLs. 
g. Other Factors 
The Act allows the Secretary of 
Energy, in determining whether a 
standard is economically justified, to 
consider any other factors that the 
Secretary deems to be relevant. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII)) Under this 
provision, DOE considered LCC impacts 
on identifiable groups of consumers, 
such as seniors and residents of multi- 
family housing, who may be 
disproportionately affected by any 
national energy conservation standard 
level. In addition, DOE considered the 
uncertainties associated with the heat 
pump water heater market related to the 
ability of manufacturers to ramp up 
production of heat pump water heaters 
to serve the U.S. market, the ability of 
heat pump component manufacturers to 
increase production to serve the water

heater market, and the ability to retrain 
enough servicers and installers of water 
heaters to serve the market. See section 
V.C.1 for an additional discussion of the 
uncertainties in the heat pump water 
heater market. 
For the results of DOE’s LCC subgroup 
analysis, see section IV.G of this notice 
and chapter 11 of the NOPR TSD. For 
a full discussion of the uncertainties 
related to heat pump water heaters, see 
sections V.C.1 and IV.B.3 of this notice. 
2. Rebuttable Presumption 
As set forth in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii), EPCA provides for a 
rebuttable presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the additional cost to the 
consumer of a product that meets the 
standard level is less than three times 
the value of the first-year energy (and, 
as applicable, water) savings resulting 
from the standard, as calculated under 
the applicable DOE test procedure. The 
LCC and PBP analyses generate values 
that calculate the payback period for 
consumers of potential amended energy 
conservation standards. These analyses 
include, but are not limited to, the 3- 
year payback period contemplated 
under the rebuttable presumption test 
discussed above. However, DOE 
routinely conducts a full economic 
analysis that considers the full range of 
impacts, including those to the 
consumer, manufacturer, Nation, and 
environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i). The results of 
this analysis serve as the basis for DOE 
to definitively evaluate the economic 
justification for a potential standard 
level (thereby supporting or rebutting 
the results of any preliminary 
determination of economic 
justification). The rebuttable 
presumption payback calculation is 
discussed in section IV.D of this NOPR 
and chapter 8 of the NOPR TSD. 
IV. Methodology and Discussion 
In November 2006, DOE published a 
notice of public meeting and availability 
of the framework document. 71 FR 
67825 (Nov. 24, 2006). DOE initially 
presented its proposed methodology for 
the analyses pertaining to the heating 
products rulemaking in the framework 
document. After receiving comments 
from interested parties on the 
approaches proposed in the framework 
document, DOE modified its 
methodology and assumptions, and 
performed a preliminary analysis for 
heating products. Subsequently, DOE 
published a notice of public meeting on 
January 13, 2009. 74 FR 1643. In the 
Executive Summary of that notice and 
preliminary TSD which accompanied it, 
DOE detailed its preliminary analysis 
conducted for the heating products 
rulemaking, including methodology, 
assumptions, and results. After 
receiving further comment from 
interested parties on the analytical 
approach and results of the preliminary 
analysis, DOE further refined its 
analyses for today’s NOPR. 
DOE used two spreadsheet tools to 
estimate the impact of today’s proposed 
standards. The first spreadsheet 
calculates LCCs and PBPs of potential 
new energy conservation standards. The 
second provides shipments forecasts 
and then calculates national energy 
savings and net present value impacts of 
potential new energy conservation 
standards. DOE also assessed 
manufacturer impacts, largely through 
use of the Government Regulatory 
Impact Model (GRIM). These 
spreadsheets are available online at: 
http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ 
appliance_standards/residential/ 
waterheaters.html. 
Additionally, DOE estimated the 
impacts on utilities and the 
environment of potential energy 
efficiency standards for the three 
heating products. DOE used a version of 
EIA’s National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) for the utility and 
environmental analyses. The NEMS 
model simulates the energy sector of the 
U.S. economy. EIA uses NEMS to 
prepare its AEO, a widely-known energy 
forecast for the United States. The EIA 
approves the use of the name NEMS to 
describe only an AEO version of the 
model without any modification to code 
or data. For more information on NEMS, 
refer to The National Energy Modeling 
System: An Overview 1998. DOE/EIA– 
0581 (98) (Feb. 1998) (available at: 
http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/FTPROOT/ 
forecasting/058198.pdf). 
The version of NEMS used for 
appliance standards analysis is called 
NEMS–BT. Because the present analysis 
entails some minor code modifications 
and runs the model under various 
policy scenarios that deviate from AEO 
assumptions, the name ‘‘NEMS–BT’’ 
refers to the model as used here. (‘‘BT’’ 
stands for DOE’s Building Technologies 
Program.) NEMS–BT offers a 
sophisticated picture of the effect of 
standards because it accounts for the 
interactions between the various energy 
supply and demand sectors and the 
economy as a whole. 
A. Market and Technology Assessment 
1. Consideration of Products for 
Inclusion in This Rulemaking 
In this subsection, DOE is presenting 
its determination of scope and coverage 
for the rulemaking. Specifically, this 
subsection addresses whether EPCA 
covers certain products and provides 
DOE with the authority to adopt 
standards for those products. Second, it 
addresses certain types of heating 
products that are covered under EPCA, 
but for which DOE is not proposing 
amended standards at this time, due to 
other relevant statutory provisions, 
technological limitations, or other 
considerations. 
a. Determination of Coverage Under the 
Act 
i. Solar-Powered Water Heaters and Pool 
Heaters 
As indicated above, EPCA directs 
DOE to determine whether to amend the 
energy conservation standards that the 
Act prescribes for residential water 
heaters and pool heaters. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(e)(4)) Under EPCA, any standard 
for residential water heaters and pool 
heaters must establish either a 
maximum amount of energy use or a 
minimum level of efficiency that is 
based on energy use (42 U.S.C. 6291(5)– 
(6)). EPCA defines ‘‘energy use,’’ in part, 
as ‘‘the quantity of energy’’ that the 
product consumes. (42 U.S.C. 6291(4)) 
Further, EPCA covers these two 
products as consumer products. (42 
U.S.C. 6291(2); 6292(a)(4), (9), and (11)) 
EPCA defines ‘‘consumer product,’’ in 
part, as an article that consumes or is 
designed to consume energy. (42 U.S.C. 
6291(1)) EPCA defines ‘‘energy’’ as 
meaning ‘‘electricity, or fossil fuels,’’ or 
other fuels that DOE adds to the 
definition, by rule, upon determining 
‘‘that such inclusion is necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the purposes’’ 
of EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6291(3)) DOE does 
not have statutory authority to add solar 
energy (or any other type of fuel) to 
EPCA’s definition of ‘‘energy.’’ Thus, 
DOE presently lacks authority to 
prescribe standards for these products 
when they use the sun’s energy instead 
of fossil fuels or electricity because 
EPCA currently covers only water 
heaters and pool heaters that use 
electricity or fossil fuels, and because 
any ‘‘energy conservation standard’’ 
currently adopted under EPCA for these 
two products must address or be based 
on the quantity of these fuels, but not 
solar power, that the product consumes. 
As to water heaters, DOE lacks authority 
to adopt standards for solar-powered 
products for an additional reason. 
‘‘Water heater’’ under EPCA currently 
means ‘‘a product which utilizes oil, 
gas, or electricity to heat potable water,’’ 
thereby excluding solar water heaters 
from coverage. (42 U.S.C. 6291(27); 10 
CFR 430.2)

65865 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
3 The Air-Conditioning, Heating, and 
Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) is the trade 
association that represents manufacturers of heating 
products. It was formed on January 1, 2008, by the 
merger of the Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association (GAMA), which formerly represented 
these manufacturers, and the Air-Conditioning and 
Refrigeration Institute. AHRI maintains a 
Consumers’ Directory of Certified Product 
Performance for water heaters, direct heating 
equipment, and pool heaters which can be found on 
AHRI’s Web site at http://www.ahridirectory.org/ 
ahridirectory/pages/home.aspx. 
ii. Add-On Heat Pump Water Heaters 
EPCA defines a residential ‘‘water 
heater,’’ in part, as a product that 
‘‘heat[s] potable water for use outside 
the heater upon demand, including 
* * * heat pump type units * * * 
which are products designed to transfer 
thermal energy from one temperature 
level to a higher temperature level for 
the purpose of heating water, including 
all ancillary equipment such as fans, 
storage tanks, pumps, or controls 
necessary for the device to perform its 
function.’’ (42 U.S.C. 6291(27); 10 CFR 
430.2) Integral heat pump water heaters 
are fully functioning water heaters when 
shipped by the manufacturer. They heat 
water for use outside the appliance 
upon demand and include in a single 
packaged product all of the components 
required for operation as a water heater. 
Therefore, integral units meet EPCA’s 
definition of a ‘‘water heater.’’ 
Another product sold for residential 
use is commonly known as an add-on 
heat pump water heater. This product 
typically is marketed and used as an 
add-on component to a separately 
manufactured, fully functioning storage 
water heater (usually a conventional 
electric storage-type unit). The add-on 
unit consists of a small pump and a heat 
pump system. The pump circulates the 
refrigerant from the water heater storage 
tank through the heat pump system and 
back into the tank. The add-on heat 
pump extracts heat from the 
surrounding air and transfers it to the 
water in a process that is much more 
efficient than traditional electric 
resistance designs. The unit can be 
mounted on top of the storage tank, or 
can be separately placed on the floor or 
mounted on a wall. Add-on units cannot 
by themselves provide hot water on 
demand, but rather heat water only after 
being added to a storage-type water 
heater. Manufacturers do not ship the 
product as a fully-functioning water 
heating unit or paired with a storage 
tank. The add-on device, by itself, is not 
capable of heating water and lacks much 
of the equipment necessary to operate as 
a water heater. As such, it does not meet 
EPCA’s definition of a ‘‘water heater’’ 
and currently is not a covered product. 
Consequently, DOE is not proposing in 
this rulemaking to adopt energy 
conservation standards for such add-on 
heat pump units. 
iii. Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water 
Heaters With Inputs Above and Below 
the Levels Specified in Existing 
Definitions 
Another element of EPCA’s definition 
of a residential ‘‘water heater’’ is that it 
includes ‘‘instantaneous type units 
which heat water but contain no more 
than one gallon of water per 4,000 Btu 
[British thermal units (Btu)] per hour of 
input, including gas instantaneous 
water heaters with an input of 200,000 
Btu per hour or less * * *.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6291(27)(B); 10 CFR 430.2) DOE’s test 
procedure for residential water heaters 
implements and elaborates on this 
definition: ‘‘Gas Instantaneous Water 
Heater means a water heater that * * * 
has an input greater than 50,000 Btu/hr 
(53 MJ/h) but less than 200,000 Btu/h 
(210 MJ/h) * * *.’’ 10 CFR part 430, 
subpart B, appendix E, section 1.7.2. 
During the preliminary analysis and as 
today’s NOPR was developed, DOE 
considered whether to evaluate for 
standards gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters with inputs greater than 200,000 
Btu/h and less than 50,000 Btu/h. 
DOE’s review of product literature 
from manufacturers of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters indicates 
that the majority of such products rated 
for residential, whole-house use has an 
input capacity of 199,000 Btu/h, and, 
thus, are covered by this rulemaking. 
Given the limitations set by Congress, 
residential gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters with inputs greater than 200,000 
Btu/h do not meet EPCA’s definition of 
a ‘‘water heater.’’ Consequently, DOE is 
not proposing in this rulemaking to 
adopt energy conservation standards for 
such products. 
Regarding the lower end of the range, 
DOE reviewed Air-Conditioning, 
Heating, and Refrigeration Institute’s 
(AHRI) 3 Consumers’ Directory of 
Certified Efficiency Ratings for Heating 
and Water Heating Equipment and 
manufacturer literature to determine the 
input capacities of products currently 
being offered for sale on the U.S. 
market. DOE found that the Directory 
contains only one gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater with an 
input capacity less than 50,000 Btu/h. 
Moreover, DOE determined that this 
product has been discontinued and is 
being replaced by a comparable product 
that has an input capacity greater than 
50,000 Btu/h. Therefore, DOE is not 
proposing standards for products with 
an input capacity below 50,000 Btu/h. 
iv. Input Capacity for Residential Pool 
Heaters and Coverage of Spa Heaters 
Under EPCA, ‘‘pool heater’’ is defined 
as ‘‘an appliance designed for heating 
nonpotable water contained at 
atmospheric pressure, including heating 
water in swimming pools, spas, hot tubs 
and similar applications.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6291(25); 10 CFR 430.2) During a 
preliminary phase of this rulemaking, 
DOE considered excluding from 
consideration pool heaters with an 
input capacity greater than 1 million 
Btu/h, based on its understanding that 
manufacturers market such pool heaters 
as light industrial or commercial 
products. Subsequently, two 
manufacturers advised DOE that the 
industry defines residential pool heaters 
as having an input capacity of less than 
or equal to 400,000 Btu/h. These 
comments suggested that DOE should 
use this capacity limit in its definition 
of residential pool heaters and for 
determining the scope of coverage of 
this product under EPCA. 
As indicated by its definition of ‘‘pool 
heater,’’ quoted above, EPCA places no 
capacity limit on the pool heaters it 
covers. (42 U.S.C. 6291(25)) 
Furthermore, EPCA covers pool heaters 
as a ‘‘consumer product,’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6291(2), 6292(a)(11)) and defines 
‘‘consumer product,’’ in part, as an 
article that ‘‘to any significant extent, is 
distributed in commerce for personal 
use or consumption by individuals.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6291(1)) These provisions 
establish that EPCA, and standards 
adopted under it, apply to any pool 
heater distributed to any significant 
extent as a consumer product for 
residential use, regardless of input 
capacity; pool heaters marketed as 
commercial equipment, which contain 
additional design modifications related 
to safety requirements for installation in 
commercial buildings, are not covered 
by this standard. Therefore, DOE has 
tentatively concluded that an input 
capacity limit is neither necessary nor 
appropriate to determine the scope of 
coverage of this product under EPCA. 
Regarding whether spa heaters, which 
heat the water in spas, are covered 
products, DOE notes that EPCA defines 
a ‘‘pool heater’’ to include appliances 
‘‘designed for * * * heating water in 
* * * spas.’’ (42 U.S.C. 6291(25); 10 
CFR 430.2) As the definition 
encompasses spa heaters, they are 
covered by EPCA as well as by the 
current standards for pool heaters, and 
DOE has included them in this 
rulemaking. Because spa heaters and 
pool heaters perform similar functions, 
include similar features, and lack 
performance or operating features that

would cause them to have inherently 
different energy efficiencies, DOE has 
not created a separate product class for 
such units. 
v. Vented Hearth Products 
As discussed in section II.C.2 above, 
before the enactment of NAECA, EPCA 
included ‘‘home heating equipment’’ in 
DOE’s appliance standards program. 
EPCA did not define ‘‘home heating 
equipment.’’ NAECA’s amendments to 
EPCA included replacing the term 
‘‘home heating equipment’’ with ‘‘direct 
heating equipment,’’ and specified 
energy conservation standards for 
‘‘direct heating equipment.’’ However, 
EPCA did not define this term, and 
subsequent legislation has not amended 
EPCA to provide a definition of ‘‘direct 
heating equipment.’’ 
DOE defined ‘‘home heating 
equipment’’ and related terms in its 
regulations. These definitions inform 
the meaning of ‘‘direct heating 
equipment.’’ 10 CFR 430.2. Specifically, 
DOE defines ‘‘home heating equipment’’ 
as meaning ‘‘vented home heating 
equipment and unvented home heating 
equipment,’’ and defines each of these 
two terms. Id. The definition of ‘‘vented 
home heating equipment,’’ relevant 
here, is as follows: 
* * * a class of home heating equipment, not 
including furnaces, designed to furnish 
warmed air to the living space of a residence, 
directly from the device, without duct 
connections (except that boots not to exceed 
10 inches beyond the casing may be 
permitted) and includes: vented wall furnace, 
vented floor furnace, and vented room 
heater.’’ Id. 
DOE also defines the last three terms in 
this definition. Id. In order to provide 
additional clarity for interested parties, 
DOE is proposing to define the term 
‘‘direct heating equipment’’ in today’s 
rulemaking. Specifically, DOE is 
proposing to add the following 
definition in 10 CFR 430.2: 
Direct heating equipment means vented 
home heating equipment and unvented home 
heating equipment. 
Given that background, the following 
addresses the issue of vented hearth 
products. 
Vented hearth products include gas- 
fired products such as fireplaces, 
fireplace inserts, stoves, and log sets 
that typically include aesthetic features 
such as a yellow flame. Consumers 
typically purchase these products to add 
aesthetic qualities and ambiance to a 
room, and the products also provide 
space heating. They provide such 
heating by furnishing warmed air to the 
living space of a residence directly from 
the device without duct connections. 
There are two types of vented hearth 
product designs: (1) Recessed and (2) 
non-recessed. Recessed products are 
typically incorporated into or attached 
to a wall, whereas non-recessed 
products are typically free-standing and 
not attached to a wall. Both may include 
fireplace or hearth aesthetics, and the 
recessed product may include a 
surrounding mantle. 
Vented hearth products meet DOE’s 
definition of ‘‘vented home heating 
equipment,’’ because they are designed 
to furnish warmed air to the living space 
of a residence without duct connections. 
Furthermore, recessed and non-recessed 
vented hearth products are similar in 
design to some of the direct heating 
products for which EPCA prescribes 
standards, namely gas wall fan and 
gravity-type furnaces in the case of 
recessed products, and room heaters in 
the case of non-recessed products. 
In sum, DOE has tentatively 
concluded that vented hearth products 
are covered products under EPCA, 
because they meet DOE’s definition for 
‘‘vented home heating equipment’’ and, 
therefore, are classified as DHE. Thus, 
DOE proposes to establish standards for 
these products in this rulemaking and 
subject these products to the existing 
testing and certification provisions for 
DHE. See section IV.2 and IV.3, below, 
for additional discussion on DOE’s 
proposal for establishing coverage of 
hearth products and the product classes 
for the rulemaking analyses. If DOE 
finalizes this rulemaking as proposed 
for hearth type DHE, manufacturers of 
these products would be subject to the 
provisions in 10 CFR parts 430.23, 
430.24, 430.27, 430.32, 430.33, 430.40 
through 430.49, 430.50 through 430.57, 
430.60 through 430.65, and 430.70 
through 430.75, which currently apply 
to DHE. DOE seeks comment on the 
potential burdens to manufacturers of 
hearth-type DHE as a result of the 
testing, certification, reporting, and 
enforcement provisions in these 
sections. (See Issue 2 under ‘‘Issues on 
Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ in section 
VII.E of this NOPR.) 
b. Covered Products Not Included in 
This Rulemaking 
i. Unvented Direct Heating Equipment 
(Including Electric Equivalents to Gas- 
Fired Products) 
When EPCA included ‘‘home heating 
equipment’’ as a covered product, DOE 
construed this term as including 
unvented as well as vented products, 
and prescribed a separate test procedure 
for each one. 43 FR 20128 (May 10, 
1978); 43 FR 20147 (May 10, 1978). 
Each of these test procedures has since 
been amended, and they are codified in 
10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendices 
G and O, respectively. The new energy 
conservation standards for this 
equipment in NAECA’s amendments to 
EPCA in 1987 were only for gas 
products, however, and used the AFUE 
descriptor, which applies to vented but 
not unvented equipment. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(e)(3)) The AFUE descriptor is 
generally a measure of the amount of 
heat provided by the product compared 
to the amount of fuel supplied. 
Subsequent DOE actions concerning 
DHE—first in a NOPR proposing 
standards for eight separate products, 59 
FR 10464 (March 4, 1994), and then in 
a final rule adopting test procedure 
amendments for DHE, 62 FR 26140 
(May 12, 1997)—have focused solely on 
vented products. This approach reflects 
DOE’s understanding that because 
unvented heating products dissipate any 
heat losses directly into the conditioned 
space rather than elsewhere through a 
vent, the amount of energy losses from 
these products is minimal. 
The current test procedure for 
unvented equipment includes neither a 
method for measuring energy efficiency 
nor a descriptor for representing the 
efficiency of unvented home heating 
equipment. Instead, the current test 
procedure focuses on a method to 
measure and calculate the annual 
energy consumption of unvented 
equipment.10 CFR part 430, subpart B, 
appendix G. Nevertheless, it remains the 
case that the unvented products in 
question would dissipate any heat 
losses directly into the conditioned 
space, thereby resulting in minimal 
overall energy losses. Thus, DOE sees 
little benefit from setting a minimum 
efficiency level for these products and 
believes that it would be unnecessary to 
do so, given the extremely limited 
energy savings that could be achieved 
by such a standard. For these reasons, 
and consistent with previous 
rulemakings in which it has addressed 
DHE, DOE has not evaluated unvented 
products in this rulemaking and is not 
proposing standards for them at this 
time. 
ii. Electric Pool Heaters 
EPCA’s definition of ‘‘pool heater,’’ 
quoted above, is not limited to 
appliances that use a particular type or 
types of fuel. (42 U.S.C. 6291(25); 10 
CFR 430.2) Thus, EPCA covers both gas- 
fired pool heaters and electric pool 
heaters, including heat pump pool 
heaters. EPCA also specifies that the 
energy efficiency descriptor for 
residential pool heaters is thermal 
efficiency. (42 U.S.C. 6291(22)(E)). 
Lastly, EPCA defines the term ‘‘thermal 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 20:45 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\11DEP2.SGM 11DEP2jle

efficiency of pool heaters’’ as ‘‘a 
measure of the heat in the water 
delivered at the heater outlet divided by 
the heat input of the pool heater as 
measured under test conditions 
specified in section 2.8.1 of the 
American National Standard for Gas 
Fired Pool Heaters, Z21.56–1986, or as 
may be prescribed by the Secretary.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6291(26)) 
Currently, DOE’s test procedures 
specify only a method for testing gas- 
fired pool heaters (10 CFR part 430, 
subpart B, appendix P), and the current 
energy conservation standard for pool 
heaters is a minimum level of thermal 
efficiency that applies only to gas-fired 
products. In order for DOE to consider 
an energy conservation standard for 
electric pool heaters, DOE would first 
need to establish a test procedure for 
electric pool heaters using the thermal 
efficiency metric required by EPCA. 
DOE seeks comments from interested 
parties on how DOE could address 
EPCA’s efficiency descriptor 
requirements in a future potential test 
procedure revision for electric pool 
heaters. For this reason, DOE is 
proposing amended standards for gas- 
fired pool heaters only and is not 
considering standards for electric pool 
heaters. This is identified as Issue 3 in 
Section VII.E, ‘‘Issues on Which DOE 
Seeks Comment.’’ 
iii. Tabletop and Electric Instantaneous 
Water Heaters 
Standards are currently applicable to 
tabletop and electric instantaneous 
water heaters. (10 CFR 430.32(d)) These 
products meet EPCA’s definition of 
‘‘water heater’’ (42 U.S.C. 6291(27); 10 
CFR 430.2) and are covered by the Act 
because they utilize electricity to heat 
potable water for use outside the heater 
upon demand. However, for the reasons 
explained below, DOE has not analyzed 
tabletop water heaters and electric 
instantaneous water heaters in this 
rulemaking, and is not proposing 
amended standards for them, because of 
the limited potential for energy savings 
from higher standards for these 
products. 
Tabletop products are primarily 
electric and are relatively small units 
because they are designed to be located 
underneath tabletops in highly 
specialized applications. The only 
means of which DOE is aware for 
manufacturers to increase the energy 
efficiency of tabletop units is to increase 
the thickness of their insulation, which 
would make them larger. Manufacturers 
already maximize the size of these water 
heaters in order to meet the currently 
required minimum energy factors, and 
size restrictions do not allow the units 
to be any larger. Thus, DOE is unaware 
of any means to make tabletop water 
heaters more energy efficient. Put 
another way, if DOE were to adopt a 
higher efficiency standard for this 
product, it would force this class of 
covered product off the market, in 
violation of 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4). For 
these reasons, DOE has not evaluated 
tabletop products in this rulemaking 
and is not proposing standards for them. 
Regarding electric instantaneous 
water heaters, DOE notes that the energy 
efficiency metric for electric 
instantaneous water heaters (and all 
other water heaters) is a combination of 
recovery efficiency and standby losses. 
All electric water heaters, including 
instantaneous products, have minor 
losses in recovery efficiency. Moreover, 
electric instantaneous water heaters 
have negligible standby losses because 
they store no more than two gallons of 
hot water. In addition, many of the 
electric instantaneous products 
currently on the market perform well 
above the existing applicable energy 
conservation standard and use available 
technologies to produce negligible 
standby losses. Therefore, DOE has not 
evaluated electric instantaneous water 
heaters in this rulemaking and is not 
proposing standards for them. 
iv. Combination Water Heating/Space 
Heating Products 
EPCA authorizes DOE to set more 
than one standard for any product that 
performs more than one major function 
by setting one energy conservation 
standard for each major function. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(5)) Some products on the 
market provide both water heating and 
space heating. To the extent such 
combination products meet EPCA’s 
criteria for coverage, DOE could set 
standards for them, including a separate 
standard for each of those functions. Id. 
However, because DOE’s current test 
procedure cannot handle combination 
appliances and DOE has not yet adopted 
a test procedure to determine the energy 
efficiency of these combination 
appliances, DOE has not evaluated them 
in this rulemaking and is not proposing 
standards for them. 
2. Definition of Gas Hearth Direct 
Heating Equipment 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
stated that vented hearth products can 
be used to provide residential space 
heating. When used to furnish heat to a 
living space, DOE reasoned that these 
products provide the same function and 
utility as vented heaters. DOE stated in 
the preliminary analysis that hearth 
heaters also provide the same utility and 
function as gas wall furnaces or gas 
room heaters, and do not use any 
unique technologies. See chapter 2 of 
the preliminary TSD. Additionally, 
AHRI’s Consumers’ Directory 
categorizes fireplace heaters as either 
room heaters or wall furnaces. DOE 
treated gas hearth DHE as either a room 
heater or a wall furnace for the purposes 
of the preliminary analysis and 
requested comment in the Executive 
Summary to the preliminary TSD on the 
need for a separate product definition 
and class for gas hearth DHE. 
AHRI stated that gas-fired hearth 
heaters need a unique definition but 
that they can be included within the 
room heater DHE product class. AHRI 
further stated that DOE should use the 
safety standard in the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
Standard Z.21–88, Vented Fireplace 
Heaters as a reference for developing a 
fireplace heater definition. (AHRI, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 
36) 
DOE agrees with AHRI and has 
decided to establish a separate 
definition for ‘‘hearth direct heating 
equipment’’ to allow manufacturers to 
easily determine coverage under DOE’s 
regulations. DOE has determined that 
hearth DHE should not be included with 
room heater DHE (the alternative 
suggested by AHRI) due to the unique 
constraints on hearth products that are 
not applicable to room heaters because 
of the former’s aesthetic appeal to 
consumers (e.g., glass viewing panes, 
yellow flames, and ceramic log sets). 
DOE reviewed the ‘‘vented gas fireplace 
heater’’ definition in ANSI Standard 
Z.21–88, as suggested by AHRI. The 
‘‘vented gas fireplace heater’’ definition 
in ANSI Standard Z.21–88 reads as 
follows: 
Vented gas fireplace heater is a vented 
appliance which simulates a solid fuel 
fireplace and furnishes warm air, with our 
without duct connections, to the space in 
which it is installed. A vented gas fireplace 
heater is such that it may be controlled by 
an automatic thermostat. The circulation of 
heating room air may be by gravity or 
mechanical means. A vented gas fireplace 
heater may be freestanding, recessed, zero 
clearance, or a gas fireplace insert. 
Part of the ‘‘vented gas fireplace 
heater’’ definition specified by ANSI 
Standard Z.21–88 would conflict with 
DOE’s definition of ‘‘home heating 
equipment.’’ 10 CFR 430.2. Specifically, 
all types of home heating equipment 
under DOE’s regulations must function 
without duct connections (although 
boots not to exceed 10 inches beyond 
the casing may be permitted). Therefore, 
DOE is modifying the definition of 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 20:45 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\11DEP2.SGM 11DEP2jle

‘‘vented gas fireplace heater’’ in ANSI 
Standard Z.21–88 to be consistent with 
the types of equipment covered under 
DOE’s authority for home heating 
equipment. Consequently, in order to 
account for hearth DHE, DOE is 
proposing a definition of ‘‘vented hearth 
heater’’ in section 430.2 to read as 
follows: 
Vented hearth heater means a vented, 
freestanding, recessed, zero clearance 
fireplace heater, a gas fireplace insert or a 
gas-stove, which simulates a solid fuel 
fireplace and is designed to furnish warm air, 
without ducts to the space in which it is 
installed. 
DOE seeks comment on its definition for 
‘‘vented hearth heater.’’ (See Issue 4 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
3. Product Classes 
In evaluating and establishing energy 
conservation standards, DOE generally 
divides covered products into classes by 
the type of energy used or by capacity 
or other performance-related feature that 
justifies a different standard for 
products having such feature. (See 42 
U.S.C. 6295(q)) In deciding whether a 
feature justifies a different standard, 
DOE must consider factors such as the 
utility of the feature to users. Id. DOE 
normally establishes different energy 
conservation standards for different 
product classes based on these criteria. 
Table IV.1 presents the product 
classes for the three types of heating 
products under consideration in this 
rulemaking. The subsections below 
provide additional details, discussion of 
comments relating to the product 
classes for the three heating products, as 
well as identified issues on which DOE 
is seeking comments.

Pool heater type Characteristics 
Residential Pool Heaters .......................................................................... Gas-fired. 
a. Water Heaters 
Residential water heaters can be 
divided into various product classes 
categorized by physical characteristics 
that affect product efficiency. Key 
characteristics affecting the energy 
efficiency of the residential water heater 
are the type of energy used and the 
volume of the storage tank. 
The existing Federal energy 
conservation standards for residential 
water heaters correspond to the 
efficiency levels promulgated by the 
January 2001 final rule, as shown in 10 
CFR 430.32(d). These product classes 
are differentiated by the type of energy 
used (i.e., electric, gas, or oil) and the 
type of storage for the water heater (i.e., 
storage, tabletop, or instantaneous). In 
this rulemaking, DOE has excluded 
tabletop water heaters and electric 
instantaneous water heaters from 
consideration for the reasons discussed 
above. Table IV.2 shows the four 
product classes presented in the 
preliminary analysis for consideration 
in today’s rulemaking.

Continued 
Residential water heater type Characteristics 
Electric Storage Type ............................................................................... Nominal input of 12 kW (40,956 Btu/h) or less; rated storage volume 
from 20 to 120 gallons. 
Gas-Fired Instantaneous .......................................................................... Nominal input of over 50,000 Btu/h up to 200,000 Btu/h; rated storage 
volume of 2 gallons or less. 
* Only the product classes covered by this rulemaking are shown. The table does not include tabletop and instantaneous electric water 
heaters. 
In response to the preliminary 
analysis, DOE received several 
comments from interested parties about 
DOE’s potential product classes and 
their organization. These comments are 
summarized and addressed immediately 
below. 
i. Gas-Fired and Electric Instantaneous 
Water Heaters 
EEI suggested that DOE should revisit 
the parameters for the input capacity 
range for gas-fired and electric 
instantaneous water heaters. 
Specifically, EEI stated that some gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters on the 
market have an input capacity higher 
than 200,000 Btu/h, and some electric 
instantaneous water heaters have an 
input capacity much higher than 12 kW. 
(EEI, No. 40 at p. 2) Northwest Energy 
Efficiency Alliance (NEEA) and 
Northwest Power and Conservation 
Council (NPCC) recommended 
combining gas-fired storage and gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters into 
one product class, because this would 
simplify the rulemaking, and the 
commenters do not believe 
manufacturers will reduce the efficiency 
of the products they offer now (most of 
which have EF ratings above 0.80) in 
response. (NEEA and NPCC, No. 42 at 
p. 4) SEISCO commented that DOE 
should establish a separate product 
class and definition for ‘‘electric 
instantaneous water heaters’’. SEISCO 
recommended creating a definition for 
‘‘whole house electric instantaneous 
water heaters’’ and amending the 
current 12 kilowatt (kW) maximum to a 
more reasonable 18 to 36 kW maximum 
to more accurately reflect the 
marketplace. (SEISCO, No. 41 at p. 1) 
In response, DOE notes that EPCA’s 
definition of ‘‘water heater,’’ establishes 
the input capacity limits for residential 
instantaneous water heaters. 
Specifically, the term ‘‘water heater’’ 
means ‘‘a product which utilizes oil, 
gas, or electricity to heat potable water 
for use outside the heater upon demand, 
including * * * (B) instantaneous type 
units which heat water but contain no 
more than one gallon of water per 4,000 
Btu per hour of input, including gas 
instantaneous water heaters with an 
input of 200,000 Btu per hour or less, 
oil instantaneous water heaters with an 
input of 210,000 Btu per hour or less, 
and electric instantaneous water heaters 
with an input of 12 kilowatts or less 
* * *’’ (42 U.S.C. 6291(27)) As noted 
above, this statutory definition 
demonstrates that residential, gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters with inputs 
greater than 200,000 Btu/h and 
residential, electric instantaneous water 
heaters with inputs greater than 12 kW 
do not meet the definitions of a ‘‘water 
heater’’ under EPCA. Accordingly, 
instantaneous water heaters outside the 
specified capacity range are not covered 
products under EPCA and are outside 
DOE’s authority for standard setting 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4). The 
input capacity ranges for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters and electric 
instantaneous water heaters are 
discussed further in sections IV.A.1.a 
and IV.A.1.b, respectively, of today’s 
NOPR. 
Additionally, DOE disagrees with the 
suggestion from NEEA and NPCC that 
DOE should combine the gas-fired 
storage and gas-fired instantaneous 
water heater product classes for this 
rulemaking. As noted earlier in this 
section, storage capacity is a key 
characteristic affecting the energy 
efficiency of water heaters, and it is 
within DOE’s authority to divide 
products into classes based on capacity. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(q)) Thus, DOE is 
maintaining separate product classes for 
gas-fired storage and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters for today’s 
NOPR. 
ii. Low-Boy Water Heaters 
AHRI recommended establishing a 
separate product class for low-boy 
heaters since they must fit under a 36- 
inch counter, be less than 34 inches 
high, and have a jacket diameter of less 
than 26 inches. AHRI stated that low- 
boy heaters provide a specific utility to 
space-constrained residences and that 
these products cannot be made any 
larger. Low-boy heaters account for 
approximately 18 percent of the 
residential market. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 
3) 
DOE does not agree that a separate 
product class needs to be established for 
low-boy water heaters. In evaluating and 
establishing energy conservation 
standards, DOE generally divides 
covered products into classes by the 
type of energy used, or by capacity or 
another performance-related feature that 
justifies a different standard. (See 42 
U.S.C. 6295(q)) DOE notes that low-boy 
water heaters use the same type of 
energy (i.e., gas or electricity) and are 
offered in a range of storage volumes. 
Thus, the type of energy used and the 
functionality of low-boy units are 
similar to other types of water heaters, 
and the size constraints of these units 
do not appear to impact energy 
efficiency, since many ‘‘low-boy’’ 
models have efficiencies that are 
comparable to standard-size water 
heaters currently available on the 
market. 
DOE seeks comment on its product 
classes for water heaters. In particular, 
DOE is seeking further comment about 
the need for a separate product class for 
low-boy water heaters. (See Issue 5 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
iii. Ultra-Low NOX Water Heaters 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE did 
not distinguish ultra-low NOX gas-fired 
storage water heaters from traditional 
gas-fired storage water heaters with 
standard burners. AHRI recommended 
establishing a separate product class. 
AHRI argued that these water heaters 
employ unique burners, designed to 
meet the ultra-low NOX requirements 
(imposed by local air quality 
management districts to limit NOX 
emissions of certain products), but 
which limit the manufacturer’s options 
to increase efficiency. (AHRI, No. 43 at 
p. 2) 
Rheem commented that instantaneous 
gas-fired water heater ultra-low NOX 
requirements from local air quality 
management districts will commence in 
2012 and that this product design

should be included in the analysis. 
(Rheem, No. 49 at p. 7) 
DOE does not agree that a separate 
product class needs to be established for 
ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage water 
heaters. As noted above, in evaluating 
and establishing energy conservation 
standards, DOE generally divides 
covered products into classes by the 
type of energy used, or by capacity or 
other performance-related feature that 
justifies a different standard for 
products having such feature. (See 42 
U.S.C. 6295(q)) Ultra-low NOX gas-fired 
storage water heaters use the same type 
of energy (i.e., gas) and are offered in 
comparable storage volumes to 
traditional gas-fired storage water 
heaters using standard burners. In 
deciding whether the product 
incorporates a performance feature that 
justifies a different standard, DOE must 
consider factors such as the utility of the 
feature to users. Id. In terms of water 
heating, DOE believes ultra-low NOX 
water heaters provide the same utility to 
the consumer. However, DOE also notes 
that ultra-low NOX water heaters do 
incorporate a specific burner 
technology, allowing these units to meet 
the strict emissions requirements of 
local air quality management districts. 
Consequently, DOE developed an 
analysis on ultra-low NOX gas-fired 
storage water heaters. See section IV.C.2 
for additional details. DOE requests 
comment from interested parties 
regarding the approach to the analysis 
for ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage 
water heaters. As indicated in section 
VII.E under Issue 6, DOE also seeks 
further comment about the need for a 
separate product class for ultra-low NOX 
water heaters. 
iv. Gas-Fired and Electric Storage Water 
Heaters Product Class Divisions 
DOE received two comments about 
the product class divisions for gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters. 
ACEEE stated that DOE should consider 
capacity-based product classes for gas- 
fired and electric storage water heaters. 
ACEEE stated that EPCA directs DOE to 
divide covered products into product 
classes by the type of energy used or by 
capacity or other performance-related 
features that affect efficiency. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(q)) ACEEE also stated that DOE’s 
energy efficiency equations demonstrate 
that capacity (i.e., rated storage volume) 
is one determinant of efficiency. 
Accordingly, ACEEE recommended 
separating gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters into two product classes, 
including ‘‘very large’’ and ‘‘other.’’ 
(ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 2) ACEEE 
expressed its belief that DOE will not 
adequately reflect the potential of the 
product classes without considering 
larger and smaller products as separate 
product classes. (ACEEE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at 
pp. 66–67) 
ACEEE suggested that gas-fired 
storage water heaters with an input 
capacity greater than 65,000 Btu/h and 
electric storage water heaters with a 
rated storage volume greater than 75 
gallons could be in the very large 
category. (ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 2) ACEEE 
commented that for heat pump water 
heaters, impacts such as air flow in 
small residences are much different for 
a 50-gallon model than a 30-gallon 
model. (ACEEE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 66–67) 
In light of the above, ACEEE 
recommended that DOE should propose 
energy conservation standards for 
electric storage water heater products in 
the very large category requiring a 
minimum EF of 1.7, which would move 
the largest electric water heaters to 
utilize heat pump water heater 
technologies. ACEEE recommended that 
DOE should propose standards for the 
very large product class of gas-fired 
storage water heaters requiring a 
minimum EF of 0.77, which 
corresponds to the least-efficient 
condensing product. (ACEEE, No. 35 at 
p. 1) 
Pacific Gas and Electric Company 
(PG&E), San Diego Gas and Electric 
(SDGE), and Southern California Gas 
Company (SoCal Gas) filed a joint 
comment and urged DOE to subdivide 
gas-fired storage water heaters and 
electric storage water heaters into 
subclasses based on rated storage 
volume. (PG&E, SDGE, and SoCal Gas, 
No. 38 at p. 3) 
DOE believes considering separate 
efficiency levels for different rated 
storage volumes could offer a way for 
DOE to capture additional potential 
energy savings. Instead of dividing gas- 
fired and electric storage water heaters 
into separate product classes by rated 
storage volume or input capacity as 
ACEEE suggested, however, DOE is 
using energy efficiency equations that 
vary with rated storage volume to 
describe the relationship between rated 
storage volume and energy factor. 
Historically, DOE has used the energy 
efficiency equations to account for the 
variability in performance resulting 
from tank size; these equations consider 
the increases in standby losses as tank 
volume increases. DOE is using the 
energy efficiency equations along with 
TSL pairings to consider different 
amended standards in the proposed 
rule. DOE further discusses the energy 
efficiency equations and the proposed 
modifications in section IV.C.7. DOE is 
requesting comment from interested 
parties on the energy efficiency 
equations developed for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters (See 
section IV.C.7 and Issue 7 under ‘‘Issues 
on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ in 
section VII.E of this NOPR for more 
information.) In addition, DOE further 
discusses the trial standard levels, 
which are comprised of various 
efficiency level pairings across the full 
range of rated storage volumes, in 
section V.A. 
v. Heat Pump Water Heaters 
In response to DOE’s treatment of heat 
pump water heaters as a design option 
for electric storage water heaters in the 
preliminary analysis, DOE received 
several comments from interested 
parties. All of the commenters urged 
DOE to establish separate product 
classes for traditional electric resistance 
storage water heaters and heat pump 
water heaters. Their specific comments 
and DOE’s response are presented 
below. 
A.O. Smith stated DOE should 
separate the electric storage water heater 
product class into two products 
classes—one for electric resistance 
heaters and one for heat pump water 
heaters. A.O. Smith noted that DOE 
separated the two classes in the 
ENERGY STAR criteria. A.O. Smith 
further stated that since heat pump 
water heaters may not even fit in 30 
percent of the installations that 
currently have resistance electric 
heaters, they cannot be considered to be 
a truly interchangeable technology. 
(A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 9) 
AHRI agreed with some of the 
concerns DOE noted in the preliminary 
screening analysis for heat pump water 
heaters. Specifically, AHRI pointed to 
previous DOE studies, which found 
size-related installation issues with 
replacing an electric storage water 
heater with a heat pump water heater. 
To AHRI’s knowledge, the heat pump 
water heater market has not changed 
significantly since DOE’s 2001 water 
heater rulemaking, even with the recent 
initiation of the ENERGY STAR program 
and the enactment of legislation that 
provides a significant tax credit for the 
installation of these systems. With this 
in mind, AHRI recommended that DOE 
establish a separate product class for 
heat pump water heaters because its 
energy source is different than that of an 
electric water heater. While a heat pump 
water heater does use electricity to 
operate certain components, the actual 
energy source that heats the water is air. 
AHRI noted that an analogous situation 
exists for electric furnaces, which are

not subject to the same standards as heat 
pump systems. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 4) 
Rheem also maintains that heat pump 
water heaters require a separate product 
class. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 5) Rheem 
commented that heat pump water heater 
designs require unique installations, air 
flow, space, condensate drain, service, 
and operational provisions that are 
considerably different from 
conventional electric storage water 
heaters. Rheem also stated that 
installation and air flow conditions will 
affect energy efficiency, and that heat 
pump water heaters cannot replace all 
electric storage type water heaters, as 
space and air flow constraints are quite 
common. Furthermore, Rheem 
commented that heat pump water heater 
technology depends largely on the 
operating environment; this represents a 
special performance-related 
consideration that warrants defining a 
separate product class for heat pump 
water heaters. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 6) 
Rheem commented that the utility heat 
pump water heaters provide is not 
equivalent to other electric storage water 
heaters across the entire range of rated 
storage volumes. Rheem stated that the 
reduced delivery performance was 
recognized by ENERGY STAR, which 
requires a minimum first-hour rating of 
50 gallons, instead of 67 gallons for 
common conventional technologies. The 
difference in utility will result in 
differing sizing guidelines to meet 
equivalent capacities. Rheem 
commented that while the primary fuel 
source for heat pump water heaters is 
assumed to be electricity, the 
technology attains an economic benefit 
by moving energy from one location to 
another. According to Rheem, it is 
conceivable that a heat pump water 
heater may operate and be designed 
with gas as a primary back-up fuel. 
Rheem noted that with energy factors 
exceeding 2.0, it can be argued that 
electricity is no longer the dominant 
fuel source. Rheem commented that 
these differences support the argument 
that heat pump water heaters are not 
simply an extension of conventional 
resistance-type electric storage water 
heaters. (Rheem, No. 49 at pp. 5–6) 
While DOE acknowledges some of the 
challenges associated with heat pump 
water heaters, DOE does not agree that 
they require a separate product class. 
Specifically, DOE does not believe heat 
pump water heaters provide a different 
utility from traditional electric 
resistance water heaters. Heat pump 
water heaters provide hot water to a 
residence just as a traditional electric 
storage water heater. In addition, both 
heat pump water heaters and traditional 
electric resistance storage water heaters 
use electricity as the primary fuel 
source. DOE believes heat pump water 
heaters can replace traditional electric 
resistance storage water heaters in most 
residences, although the installation 
requirements may be quite costly. DOE 
further addresses heat pump water 
heaters in the screening analysis at 
section IV.B.3 and the installation 
requirements in section IV.E.2.a. 
DOE seeks further comment on the 
need for a separate product class for 
heat pump water heaters. In particular, 
DOE is interested in receiving 
comments and data on whether a heat 
pump water heater can be used as a 
direct replacement for an electric 
resistance water heater, and the types 
and frequency of installations where a 
heat pump water heater cannot be used 
as a direct replacement for an electric 
resistance water heater. (See Issue 8 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
DHE can be divided into various 
product classes categorized by physical 
characteristics and rated input capacity, 
both of which affect product efficiency 
and function. Key characteristics 
affecting the energy efficiency of DHE 
are the physical construction (i.e., fan 
wall units contain circulation blowers), 
intended installation (i.e., floor furnaces 
are installed with the majority of the 
unit outside of the conditioned space), 
and input capacity. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
examined the possibility of 
consolidating product classes for DHE. 
(See chapter 3 of the preliminary TSD.) 
NAECA originally established the 
Federal energy conservation standards, 
which are differentiated by input 
capacity range. Thus, to determine 
whether consolidation of existing 
product classes is appropriate, DOE 
examined the relationship between 
AFUE and input rating for DHE. The 
results of this inquiry are presented 
below. 
i. Gas Wall Fan-Type Direct Heating 
Equipment 
For fan-type wall furnaces, DOE 
surveyed AHRI’s Consumers’ Directory 
and available product literature. DOE 
identified available products ranging 
from 8,000 to 65,000 Btu/h. The market 
data demonstrate two separate trends for 
fan-type wall furnaces based on the 
efficiency range of the products. For 
higher-efficiency products (i.e., 78 
percent AFUE and higher), DOE noticed 
that efficiency decreases as capacity 
increases. For lower-efficiency products 
(i.e., 73 to 77 percent AFUE), DOE 
noticed that efficiency increases as 
capacity increases. Therefore, because of 
the differing trends between capacity 
and efficiency, DOE proposes that the 
two product classes for gas wall fan-type 
DHE should remain. 
ii. Gas Wall Gravity-Type Direct Heating 
Equipment 
DOE examined the relationship 
between AFUE and input rating for 
gravity-type wall furnaces by reviewing 
AHRI’s Consumers’ Directory and 
available product literature. DOE 
identified products with input 
capacities ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 
Btu/h. The Federal energy conservation 
standards for gas wall gravity-type 
furnaces divide these products into 
seven product classes based on input 
capacity ranges. The seven product 
classes are differentiated by one AFUE 
percentage point increase for each 
increase in input capacity range (i.e., the 
larger the input capacity, the higher the 
AFUE requirements). The market data 
for gas wall gravity-type furnaces 
indicate that manufacturers are not 
offering products over the entire input 
capacity range. Therefore, some product 
classes may be unnecessary. DOE 
proposes that five product classes (up to 
10,000 Btu/h, over 10,000 and up to 
12,000 Btu/h, over 12,000 and up to 
15,000 Btu/h, over 15,000 and up to 
19,000 Btu/h, and over 19,000 and up to 
27,000 Btu/h) be consolidated into a 
single product class labeled up to 
27,000 Btu/h, leaving three product 
classes for gas wall gravity-type 
furnaces. 
iii. Gas Floor-Type Direct Heating 
Equipment 
DOE surveyed the current market for 
gas floor furnaces by reviewing AHRI’s 
Consumers’ Directory and available 
product literature. The AHRI directory 
lists 23 products. The Federal energy 
conservation standard includes two 
product classes divided by input 
ratings, one above and one at or below 
37,000 Btu/h. According to the AHRI 
directory, more than 75 percent of 
products are rated above 37,000 Btu/h. 
When comparing the models with the 
highest AFUE rating between the two 
product classes in the preliminary 
analysis, however, DOE found that the 
energy savings potential increases as the 
input capacity range increases. This fact 
suggests that input capacity affects the 
AFUE of gas floor-type furnaces. 
Therefore, DOE proposes that the two 
product classes for gas floor-type DHE 
should remain.

iv. Gas Room-Type Direct Heating 
Equipment 
DOE examined currently available 
room heaters by reviewing AHRI’s 
Consumers’ Directory and product 
literature. DOE found that room heaters 
have inputs ranging from 20,000 to 
70,000 Btu/h. DOE also determined that 
the relationship between AFUE and 
input rating established by the Federal 
energy conservation standards is 
generally similar to the trend found 
among products listed in the AHRI 
directory. The market data show a 
general trend of increasing AFUE with 
input capacity range. DOE is proposing 
to consolidate the two lower input 
capacity ranges into a single product 
class (i.e., input ratings up to 20,000 
Btu/h), because there are no products in 
the AHRI directory under 20,000 Btu/h 
and all products at this input rating 
have the same efficiency. As a result, 
DOE is proposing only four product 
classes for gas room heaters. 
Overall, DOE only received one 
comment in response to its product 
class consolidation for the existing DHE 
product types in the preliminary 
analysis. AHRI agreed that the number 
of product classes (i.e., divisions by 
input capacity) for DHE product classes 
can be reduced. (AHRI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 43) 
Therefore, for the NOPR, DOE is 
proposing to reduce the number of 
product classes as suggested in the 
preliminary analysis and described 
above. DOE is seeking comments on the 
proposed product classes. (See Issue 9 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
v. Gas Hearth Direct Heating Equipment 
DOE is proposing to add new product 
classes for gas hearth DHE, which are 
distinguished by input heating capacity. 
DOE modeled the product class 
divisions for gas hearth DHE after the 
proposed product class divisions for 
room heaters. DOE is seeking comments 
on the proposed product class divisions 
for gas hearth DHE. (See Issue 10 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
Table IV.3 presents the proposed 
product classes for DHE being 
considered for this rulemaking.

Over 46,000. 
c. Pool Heaters 
As discussed above, the existing 
Federal energy conservation standards 
for pool heaters correspond to the 
efficiency levels specified by EPCA, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(2)), and 
codified in 10 CFR 430.32(k), classifying 
residential pool heaters with one 
product class. This product class is 
distinguished by fuel input type (i.e., 
gas-fired). DOE notes there are currently 
electric heat pump pool heaters on the 
market, which are not being considering 
in today’s rulemaking, as discussed in 
section IV.A.1.b. 
B. Screening Analysis 
DOE uses the following four screening 
criteria to determine which technology 
options are suitable for further 
consideration in an energy conservation 
standards rulemaking: 
1. Technological feasibility. DOE will 
consider technologies incorporated in 
commercial products or in working 
prototypes to be technologically 
feasible. 
2. Practicability to manufacture, 
install, and service. If mass production 
and reliable installation and servicing of 
a technology in commercial products 
could be achieved on the scale 
necessary to serve the relevant market at 
the time the standard comes into effect, 
then DOE will consider that technology 
practicable to manufacture, install, and 
service. 
3. Adverse impacts on product utility 
or product availability. If DOE 
determines a technology would have a 
significant adverse impact on the utility 
of the product to significant subgroups 
of consumers, or would result in the 
unavailability of any covered product 
type with performance characteristics 
(including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as products 
generally available in the United States 
at the time, it will not consider this 
technology further. 
4. Adverse impacts on health or 
safety. If DOE determines that a 
technology will have significant adverse 
impacts on health or safety, it will not 
consider this technology further. 
10 CFR part 430, subpart C, appendix 
A, 4(a)(4) and 5(b). 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
initially identified the technology 
options that could improve the 
efficiency of the three types of heating 
products that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. These technologies are 
listed in Table IV.4. See chapter 3 of the 
NOPR TSD for a detailed description of 
each technology option.

considered the same technology options 
for the NOPR screening analysis.

In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
excluded several of the technologies 
listed in Table IV.4 from consideration 
in this rulemaking based on one or more 
of the screening criteria described 
above. The technology options that were 
screened out, along with the reasons for 
their exclusion, are shown below in

In response to the screening analysis 
performed for the preliminary analysis, 
DOE received feedback from several 
interested parties. 
a. General Comments 
NRDC commented generally that 
screening technologies because they 
have not penetrated the market for the 
covered product is a flawed approach. 
NDRC stated that determining if a 
product is practical to manufacture does 
not require someone to already be 
manufacturing it. Instead, NRDC stated 
that when determining whether a 
product is practical to manufacture, 
DOE should consider identified 
technology options even if they are not

currently used in covered products. 
NRDC stated that DOE should gather 
data to determine whether technologies 
used in other products would be useful 
in the products in question. (NRDC, No. 
48 at p. 3) 
In response, as part of every 
rulemaking, DOE reviews the markets 
and technologies of the appliances 
under consideration using primary and 
secondary research. DOE considers 
prototype designs in the analysis that 
have not yet fully penetrated the market. 
In the case of a prototype design (or any 
design that has not penetrated the 
market at the time of the analysis) that 
is not being manufactured on a large 
scale, DOE examines the practicality of 
manufacturing, installing, and servicing 
the design, if it were required to be 
implemented on a larger scale by the 
anticipated compliance date of a 
standard, and accepts the product or 
screens it out of the analysis on that 
basis. DOE requires demonstration of a 
technology in at least a working 
prototype, because even though 
technologies may be proven for other 
applications, it may not translate to a 
different product type for a variety of 
reasons. NRDC did not point to specific 
examples of technologies DOE should 
consider, and hence, it is more difficult 
for DOE to specifically address the 
comment. 
AHRI commented that DOE should 
recognize that many DHE products do 
not require electricity. AHRI stated that 
such designs allow consumers to use 
these products for emergency heat 
during power outages, which provides a 
real utility that needs to be factored into 
DOE’s analysis. (AHRI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 21) 
DOE considers the impact of any 
lessening of utility from standards 
during the screening analysis. If DOE 
determines a technology would have 
significant adverse impact on the utility 
of the product to significant subgroups 
of consumers, or would result in the 
unavailability of any covered product 
type with performance characteristics 
(including reliability), features, sizes, 
capacities, and volumes that are 
substantially the same as products 
generally available in the United States 
at the time, it will not consider this 
technology further. DOE considered 
several technology options for DHE that 
require electricity for the NOPR 
analyses, including electronic ignition 
systems and blowers or fans. Blowers 
and fans are generally not necessary for 
the products to operate and, because the 
equipment can be operated without 
them, do not impact the utility of being 
able to use the equipment for emergency 
heat during a power outage. For models 
with electronic ignition systems, 
electricity is required to light the 
burner, and, thus, required for product 
operation. In the case of a power failure, 
however, many products employ battery 
backup systems that can provide the 
electrical power needed to light the 
burner (or the pilot in the case of 
intermittent pilot ignitions) during the 
power outage. Because of this, an 
electronic ignition system with battery 
backup would not cause any lessening 
of utility as compared to a traditional 
standing pilot system for DHE. 
Therefore, DOE did not screen out these 
technologies. 
b. Water Heaters 
NEEA and NPCC stated that tank 
bottom insulation is an effective means 
of improving product efficiency. 
Accordingly, NEEA and NPCC urged 
DOE to consider this as a technology 
option for electric storage water heaters 
because field data from the Pacific 
Northwest suggest that tank bottom 
insulation decreases standby energy 
loss, especially when the tank is located 
on a concrete slab. (NEEA and NPCC, 
No. 42 at p. 4) 
DOE considered various 
improvements in insulation for storage 
water heaters during the screening 
analysis, including tank bottom 
insulation. (See chapter 3 of the NOPR 
TSD for a full description of the 
insulation improvements DOE 
considered.) DOE notes that tank bottom 
insulation was not screened out during 
the screening analysis, which is in 
contrast to advanced forms of insulation 
which were screened out as unproven 
(e.g., vacuum panels, aerogels). When 
listing the potential technology options 
at each efficiency level (see section 
IV.C.3), DOE shows only those 
technologies most commonly used in 
manufacturing, although specific 
implementation details vary by 
manufacturer. Manufacturers currently 
do not use increased tank bottom 
insulation as a primary means of 
increasing efficiency; therefore, it was 
not listed as one of the technologies 
used in achieving these efficiency levels 
for storage water heaters. Hence, DOE 
agrees with NEEA and NPCC that tank 
bottom insulation is an effective means 
of improving the energy factor of storage 
water heaters. 
NEEA and NPCC also urged DOE to 
include as technology options heat 
pump water heaters that use CO2 as the 
refrigerant. NEEA and NPCC 
commented that CO2 heat pump water 
heaters have been sold and serviced by 
hundreds of thousands of manufacturers 
in Southeast Asia and elsewhere over 
the last 5 to 10 years. (NEEA and NPCC, 
No. 42 at pp. 4–5) 
DOE is not considering CO2-based 
heat pump water heaters because DOE 
research suggests U.S. manufacturers do 
not have the necessary infrastructure to 
support manufacturing, installation, and 
service of CO2 heat pump water heaters 
on the scale necessary to serve the 
relevant market by the compliance date 
of an amended energy conservation 
standard. DOE also does not believe 
manufacturers would be able to develop 
the necessary infrastructure before the 
compliance date of an amended energy 
conservation standard because these 
products have not penetrated the U.S. 
market. 
ACEEE commented that DOE should 
revisit the preliminary conclusions 
presented in the screening analysis, 
including the tentative decision to not 
further consider thermophotovoltaic 
and thermoelectric generators. (ACEEE, 
No. 35 at pp. 3–4) The commenter stated 
that the inclusion of thermophotovoltaic 
and thermoelectric generators would 
make other technologies such as side- 
arm themosiphons more feasible. 
ACEEE asserted that in the case of 
thermophotovoltaic and thermoelectric 
generators, DOE assumes that line 
voltage or 24-volt power cannot be 
required for gas-fired storage water 
heaters. DOE research suggests that the 
amount of power that can be generated 
by thermophotovoltaic and 
thermoelectric generators in a 
residential storage water application is 
quite limited. Commercially-available 
thermoelectric elements for water 
heaters typically produce less than 0.05 
Watts of power, and so-called 
thermopiles can reach as high as 0.75 
Watts. While it is theoretically possible 
to power devices other than the 
customary gas valves with 
thermoelectric power sources, DOE is 
unaware of an external device that has 
an impact on energy efficiency whose 
power demands are low enough to allow 
it to be powered by such generators. 
DOE is also unaware of any 
thermophotovoltaic power generators 
that have been developed to the point 
where they could be incorporated by the 
compliance date of the rulemaking, nor 
of any role that such generators would 
play in increasing the energy efficiency 
of gas-fired storage water heaters. 
Rheem commented that DOE should 
recognize the special utility of self- 
powered water heaters. (Rheem, No. 49 
at p. 4) DOE acknowledges that most 
gas-fired storage-water heaters on the 
market today do not require an electrical 
connection to operate (i.e., they are self- 
powered). Typically, the gas valves on 
these units incorporate a thermoelectric

element that is impinged on by a 
standing pilot flame. The minute power 
generated by the thermoelectric element 
opens the gas supply in the valve 
assembly via a low-power solenoid. 
Thus, thermoelectric elements typically 
act as a safety device. They do not 
provide sufficient power to run fan 
blower motors and other high-powered 
devices. Therefore, DOE has tentatively 
decided to continue to exclude 
thermophotovoltaic and thermoelectric 
generators from its analysis, because 
they are not an effective means of 
improving the efficiency of water 
heaters. 
ACEEE also stated that DOE should 
revisit the preliminary conclusions 
presented in the screening analysis 
regarding flue dampers since 
electromechanical dampers were 
common on furnaces and boilers and 
appear to be available for residential 
boilers today. (ACEEE, No. 35 at pp. 3– 
4) DOE research suggests that there are 
no residential storage water heaters on 
the market today that incorporate such 
dampers. 
Although electromechanical dampers 
may be found on some furnaces, boilers, 
and commercial water heaters, their 
benefit in a residential water heater 
application is unknown because no 
manufacturer incorporates them in their 
products. All products that incorporate 
electromechanical dampers of which 
DOE is aware require line power to 
operate them. Thus, such dampers may 
not be practicable for all consumers. 
Additionally, DOE researched damper 
systems that do not require electrical 
power to operate. Typically, such 
systems are based on a bi-metal damper 
installed on top of the flue pipe outlet 
that opens when heated and closes as it 
cools. DOE research suggests that such 
non-electrically-actuated dampers pose 
potential health and safety problems. 
For example, such dampers can fail in 
the closed position, which could cause 
the exhaust gases to be stuck in the flue. 
Furthermore, they rely on hot air 
impingement to open. However, when 
the water heater begins its combustion 
cycle, the flue and its baffles are 
relatively cold, and flue gas 
temperatures may require some time 
until they reach the point where they 
will open a bi-metal damper quickly 
and completely. This is especially true 
for flammable vapor ignition resistant 
(FVIR) water heaters (which all 
residential water heaters are) whose 
natural draft is already restricted by 
FVIR components. With the flue shut or 
mostly shut on start-up, water heater 
combustion can be impacted in a 
number of ways, including nuisance 
lockouts, increased carbon monoxide 
production, and flue gases spilling into 
living spaces. For these reasons, non- 
electromechanical dampers were 
screened out. 
ACEEE commented that DOE should 
revisit the preliminary conclusions 
presented in the screening analysis 
regarding advanced forms of insulation, 
which resulted in DOE’s tentative 
decision to screen out those 
technologies. (ACEEE, No. 35 at pp. 3– 
4) In response, DOE research suggests 
that emerging technologies such as 
vacuum-insulated-panels (VIPs) may 
allow manufacturers to reduce heat loss, 
but such technologies have yet to find 
application in storage water heaters. 
DOE notes that ACEEE did not provide 
any new rationale or data to support 
why DOE should reconsider its original 
conclusion presented in the preliminary 
screening analysis that advanced forms 
of insulation have not been 
demonstrated as practical to 
manufacture and install. Hence, DOE 
screened out advanced forms of 
insulation from the NOPR analyses. 
ACEEE also stated that DOE should 
revisit its preliminary conclusions 
regarding sidearm heaters and two- 
phase thermosiphons (TPTS) which 
resulted in DOE’s tentative decision to 
screen out those technologies. (ACEEE, 
No. 35 at pp. 3–4) Regarding two-phase 
thermosiphons, ACEEE did not provide 
any explanation in its comment as to 
why DOE should reconsider its initial 
conclusion that it is not practicable to 
manufacture, install, and service this 
technology on the scale necessary to 
serve the relevant market at the time 
compliance with the standard is 
required. TPTSs require a drastic 
redesign of the water heater and are 
typically not practical for indoor 
installation. Therefore, DOE has 
continued to screen out this technology. 
Regarding side-arm heaters, ACEEE 
commented that sidearm heaters are 
more feasible with access to 24-volt 
power, which would allow them to be 
located above or below the unit. This 
assertion does not address DOE’s 
concerns about sidearm heaters 
presented in the preliminary analysis. 
DOE research did not reveal any 
working prototypes for gas-fired or oil- 
fired storage water heaters, and 
manufacturers seem to no longer use 
this technology. Therefore, this 
technology is not feasible and not 
practical to manufacture, install, and 
service side-arm storage water heaters 
on the scale necessary to serve the 
relevant market at the time of the 
compliance date of the standard, and 
was not considered further in the 
analysis. See chapter 4 of the NOPR 
TSD, Screening Analysis, for more 
details about DOE’s assessment of two- 
phase thermosiphons and sidearm 
heaters. 
For the reasons listed above, DOE still 
believes that thermophotovoltaic and 
thermoelectric generators, side-arm 
heaters, and advanced forms of 
insulation are not technologically 
feasible and are impractical to 
manufacture, repair, and install; that 
two-phase thermosiphons are 
impractical to manufacture, repair, and 
install; and that buoyancy operated flue 
dampers have an adverse impact on the 
safety of these products. 
Bradford White Corporation (BWC) 
stated that using multiple flues for gas- 
fired storage water heaters is difficult, 
costly, and impractical to produce on 
residential water heater tank production 
lines. (BWC, No. 46 at p. 2) 
In response, DOE research suggests 
that multi-flue storage water heaters can 
be produced at a higher production 
scale than is commonly done now. The 
current low shipment-volume 
techniques are commonly used in 
commercial gas-fired and oil-fired water 
heater designs. Solutions for higher- 
volume production of such heaters 
would require significant investments 
but are not technically infeasible. Thus, 
DOE believes multiple flue designs 
could be implemented on residential 
storage water heaters and are a viable 
technology for improving the efficiency 
of oil-fired storage water heaters. 
In summary, none of the comments 
DOE received on the screening analysis 
led DOE to reconsider its determination 
for any of the technologies that were 
excluded from the preliminary analysis. 
Therefore, DOE excluded the same 
technologies in the NOPR analysis. 
Chapter 4 of the NOPR TSD provides 
more details about the technologies that 
DOE screened out. 
2. Technologies Considered 
Based upon the totality of the 
available information, DOE has 
tentatively concluded that: (1) All of the 
efficiency levels discussed in today’s 
notice are technologically feasible; (2) 
products at these efficiency levels could 
be manufactured, installed, and serviced 
on a scale needed to serve the relevant 
markets; (3) these efficiency levels 
would not force manufacturers to use 
technologies that would adversely affect 
product utility or availability; and (4) 
these efficiency levels would not 
adversely affect consumer health or 
safety. Thus, the efficiency levels that 
DOE analyzed and is discussing in this 
notice are all achievable through 
technology options ‘‘screened in’’ 
during the screening analysis. The

3. Heat Pump Water Heaters Discussion 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
considered heat pump water heaters as 
a viable technology option for 
improving the efficiency of electric 
storage water heaters. DOE posted the 
preliminary TSD for residential heating 
products on its Web site on January 5, 
2009 (for more information see http:// 
www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ 
appliance_standards/residential/ 
water_pool_heaters_prelim_tsd.html). 
Pages 2–21 to 2–29 of chapter 2 of the 
preliminary TSD contain an extensive 
discussion of heat pump water heaters 
and the significant issues pertaining to 
the consideration of heat pump water 
heaters in this rulemaking. In the 
executive summary to the preliminary 
TSD, DOE sought comments on the 
viability of heat pump water heaters as 
a technology for electric storage water 
heaters and whether these water heaters 
would be practicable to manufacture, 
service, and install on a scale necessary 
to serve the relevant market by the 
compliance date of any amended 
standard, which would be five years 
after publication of the final rule. 
In addition, DOE sought comment on 
several other issues regarding integral 
heat pump water heaters: (1) Whether 
manufacturers would be able to finance 
the investment costs necessary to 
convert their existing product lines to 
heat pump water heaters by the 
compliance date of an amended 
standard; (2) what percentage of 
manufacturers’ product lines would be 
converted to heat pump water heaters 
by the compliance date of an amended 
standard (e.g., if standards did not reach 
the levels provided by heat pump water 
heaters); (3) how the market for heat 
pump water heaters has changed since 
the January 2001 final rule, and the 
number of installations that would incur 
a significant increase in cost due to 
extensive modifications that will have 
to be made to a residence to 
accommodate a heat pump water heater; 
and (4) heat pump water heater 
programs that have been conducted 
since the January 2001 final rule. 
In response to the preliminary 
analysis, DOE received a multitude of 
comments from interested parties, both 
at the public meeting and in written 
responses during the preliminary 
analysis comment period. A summary of 
the comments received and DOE’s 
responses are presented below. 
a. Consumer Utility 
Southern stated that DOE needs to 
address issues regarding cold air 
produced by heat pump water heaters. 
According to Southern, simply 
increasing a residence’s heat output is 
not an appropriate way to compensate 
for the cold air a heat pump water 
heater generates. Southern also asserted 
that constantly blowing cold air will 
create uneven temperatures within the 
dwelling space, leading to utility and 
comfort issues. (Southern, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 22) 
Southern noted that a heat pump water 
heater could provide supplemental 
cooling during a home’s cooling hours; 
however, concentrated cooling at a 
particular location would result in 
uneven temperatures in a home, thereby 
being incompatible with the home’s 
temperature needs. Southern stated that 
this would reduce the utility and 
performance of a home’s HVAC system, 
and that there is no practical solution. 
(Southern, No. 50 at p. 2) The 
commenter stated that an HVAC supply 
vent near the unit would not help 
mitigating cold air issues. Southern 
commented that although a vent may 
cancel the effect of the cool air supplied 
in the winter (by supplying heat), 
during the cooling season, the supply 
vent (now supplying cool air) would 
exacerbate the temperature imbalance in 
the area of the heat pump water heater. 
(Southern, No. 50 at p. 2) 
DOE agrees with Southern that cold 
air production of heat pump water 
heaters should be considered in the 
analysis. While DOE believes most 
consumers would choose to increase the 
use of their space heating system to deal 
with the increased heating load, DOE 
did account for the possibility that some 
consumers would choose to install 
ductwork to vent cold air away from the 
space surrounding the water heater to 
the outdoors to overcome uneven 
temperature problems. The increased 
installation costs of venting cold air 
away from a conditioned space, along 
with the increased cost of space heating 
for consumers who choose not to vent 
cold air away from the conditioned 
space, are accounted for in DOE’s

analysis for certain percentages of 
consumers (see section IV.E.2). 
Southern also commented on noise 
issues. Southern stated that is difficult 
to comment on a hypothetical product 
where no specifications exist, but that 
existing electric storage water heaters 
are often located in utility closets close 
to bedrooms and living areas. The 
commenter asserted that even if the 
product generates decibel levels similar 
to a refrigerator, such noise is a matter 
of greater concern because a heat pump 
water heater would tend to be in closer 
proximity to a bedroom or other quiet 
living area, as compared to a refrigerator 
located in a kitchen. Noise dampening 
would not be practical because louvered 
doors would be required to allow 
adequate air flow for the heat pump 
water heater. Southern cited the EPCA 
criteria, stating that there would be a 
significant impact on the utility or 
performance of the appliance if 
excessive noise disturbs the consumer. 
(Southern, No. 50 at p. 2) 
DOE does not agree that the 
additional noise from a compressor used 
for a heat pump water heater would 
affect consumer utility for two reasons. 
First, as Southern points out, noise from 
a heat pump water heater compressor 
may be comparable in decibel level to 
the noise created by a refrigerator 
compressor, which has not been found 
to adversely affect consumer utility. 
Second, while the actual impact of 
excess noise created by a compressor 
may vary greatly based on the location 
of the appliance installation, DOE does 
not have any reason to believe that 
water heaters are any more likely to be 
installed near a bedroom than a 
refrigerator. Water heaters are typically 
not installed in consumers’ bedrooms or 
living spaces, but instead are usually 
installed in garages, closets, basements, 
attics, or other locations away from the 
living space. Thus, DOE believes that 
noise created by a compressor would 
not significantly impact consumer 
utility. 
b. Production, Installation, and 
Servicing Issues 
DOE received numerous comments in 
response to the preliminary analysis on 
the practicality of manufacturing, 
installing, and servicing heat pump 
water heaters. 
Southern stated that it is difficult to 
determine whether heat pump water 
heaters would be practical to install and 
service and if they are reliable, because 
at the time Southern submitted this 
comment, there were no products on the 
market to compare against. (DOE notes 
several heat pump water heaters have 
recently become available on the 
market). Also, no product exists yet that 
could be mass produced and available 
in 2015 in response to a heat pump 
water heater energy efficiency standard. 
(Southern, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 34.4 at pp. 58–59) Further, Southern 
commented that installation of heat 
pump water heaters in new construction 
is still problematic for multifamily 
housing, although the issues are less 
severe than in replacement installations. 
In multifamily housing, interior 
locations are preferred for mechanical 
systems, and perimeter locations (e.g., 
windows and balconies) are preferred 
for exterior exposures. Southern stated 
that a heat pump water heater could be 
installed in an interior, but the addition 
of supply and return vents to the 
outdoors would be expensive. Southern 
also stated that placing the heat pump 
water heater at a perimeter location is 
possible, but would reduce the 
architectural options available for 
builders. (Southern, No. 50 at pp. 2–3) 
Finally, Southern commented that it is 
very concerned about the possible 
selection of an amended conservation 
standard at an efficiency level that 
would require heat pump water heaters. 
Southern strongly encourages the use of 
heat pump water heaters, but it argued 
that given operational differences, they 
are not suitable for some consumers due 
to the need for very expensive building 
modifications. (Southern, No. 50 at p. 1) 
BWC noted that the owner or installer 
can return a water heater to the 
manufacturer if a defect is claimed. 
BWC stated that in these cases, units are 
tested and typically there is no actual 
defect. According to BWC, if heat pump 
water heaters are introduced on a larger 
scale, it is likely that more water heaters 
will be returned to the manufacturer 
without servicing because many 
traditional plumbers (who would install 
the heat pump water heaters) have no 
HVAC training and no refrigerant 
licenses. (BWC, No. 46 at p. 2) BWC 
stated that training and education costs 
associated with heat pump water 
heaters were overlooked in the previous 
rulemaking and have been overlooked 
in the current rulemaking as well. 
(BWC, No. 46 at p. 2) 
GE stated that it will be producing a 
heat pump water heater sometime in the 
near future, and asserted that it is 
practical to manufacturer, install, and 
service heat pump water heaters. 
Further, GE added that it has the 
facilities to both manufacture and 
service these products. It is GE’s 
opinion that there will be a great deal 
of consumer interest in such products, 
and that this market will increase and 
be much larger than the current market. 
(GE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 
at p. 63) 
In its written submission, GE also 
commented on the practicality of 
installation and service. GE stated that 
its heat pump water heater occupies the 
exact footprint of a standard water 
heater and requires the same electrical 
and plumbing connections. (GE, No. 51 
at p. 2) According to GE, the vast 
majority of installations would be 
simple and straightforward, and 
consumers would achieve significant 
energy savings and often may obtain 
collateral installation benefits such as 
dehumidified basements or cooler attics. 
(GE, No. 51 at p. 2) GE argued that heat 
pump water heaters installed in humid 
locations could eliminate the need for a 
separate dehumidifier, which could 
save consumers both capital and energy. 
(GE, No. 51 at p. 2) GE acknowledged 
that a heat pump water heater produces 
a small amount of condensate. However, 
GE commented that this would not 
require any building modifications, as 
condensate is easily drained to a floor 
drain that should accompany each water 
heater for leakage or overflow. (GE, No. 
51 at p. 2) Alternatively, GE commented 
that for heat pump water heaters that are 
not installed near a floor drain, a small 
condensate pump (similar to those used 
for HVAC installations) can be installed 
to pump condensate to a suitable drain. 
(GE, No. 51 at p. 2) GE did state that 
heat pump water heater installation in 
confined spaces with very small areas 
and no ventilation may present 
challenges. (GE, No. 51 at p. 2) 
Regarding the reliability issues 
surrounding heat pump water heaters, 
ACEEE stated that the historical record 
of failures for heat pump water heaters 
arises from the fact that initial models 
were brought to market by laboratory- 
based applied research and 
development companies and 
commercial niche companies, rather 
than the major consumer appliance 
companies that are currently 
announcing heat pump water heater 
products. ACEE stated that an analysis 
which ignores the nature of the 
manufacturer is bound to misrepresent 
the potential of the heat pump water 
heater. (ACEEE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 65–66) NEEA 
and NPCC acknowledged the failure 
issues discussed in the preliminary 
analyses, but they argued that the 
failures have been attributable to the 
control boards, which other markets 
have experienced. NEEA and NPCC 
stated that the control board failures are 
not characteristic of the heat pump 
water heaters, but of the electronics 
industry itself, and replacement is a

simple and inexpensive remedy. (NEEA 
and NPCC, No. 42 at p. 5) 
In response to the comments provided 
by Southern, BWC, GE, ACEEE, NEEA, 
and NPCC, DOE believes that heat pump 
water heaters could potentially be 
installed and serviced on the scale 
necessary for the residential market 
before the potential compliance date of 
an amended energy conservation 
standard for water heaters. Although 
servicing heat pump water heaters will 
require significantly more training than 
servicing traditional electric storage 
water heater technologies, DOE notes 
that many domestic appliances are 
being installed and repaired today 
which feature compressors (i.e., 
refrigerators, room air conditioners, and 
similar appliances). DOE believes that, 
given the 5-year delay between the 
issuance of the final rule and the 
compliance date and the fact that many 
manufacturers already have these 
products under development, it is 
unclear whether manufacturers would 
be able to retrain installers and service 
technicians to install and service heat 
pump water heater technology. DOE 
estimated the additional costs that 
would be incurred as a result of 
increased certification requirements to 
install and service heat pump water 
heaters in its analyses. See section 
IV.E.2 for details. 
A.O. Smith asserted that heat pump 
water heaters are a viable technology to 
serve a portion of the water heater 
market, but that they are only practical 
for a small, niche part of the market and 
should never be considered when 
setting the ‘‘efficiency floor’’ of the 
electric water heater market. A.O. Smith 
argued that manufacturers could make 
the investment needed for the small 
volumes of heat pump water heaters 
that manufacturers believe are practical, 
but the cost of changing every line 
completely over to heat pump water 
heaters would be prohibitive. In 
addition, A.O. Smith stated that the 
percentage of heat pump water heaters 
to penetrate the market will be small 
and will be driven by market incentives 
such as tax credits and rebates. (A.O. 
Smith, No. 37 at p. 8) BWC stated that 
it could likely convert some of its 
product lines to heat pump water 
heaters by the compliance date of the 
standard. BWC also commented that 
without knowing the cost to retrofit 
current production lines and the cost of 
heat pump water heaters, it cannot 
comment on what percentage could be 
converted by the compliance date. 
(BWC, No. 46 at p. 1) Edison Electric 
Institute stated that heat pump water 
heaters are different from standard 
electric storage water heaters and cannot 
be considered for direct replacements 
due to technology, size, and other 
issues. EEI also stated its concern that 
industry would not be able to increase 
production from under 10,000 units per 
year to 4.5 million units per year by the 
compliance date of the standard. 
According to EEI, if DOE does not create 
a separate product class for heat pump 
water heaters, DOE should screen out 
this technology from this rulemaking. 
(EEI, No. 40 at p. 3) 
DOE acknowledges there could be 
issues with converting entire production 
lines to manufacture heat pump water 
heaters before the compliance date of 
this standard. However, DOE also notes 
that significant portions of heat pump 
water heaters are expected to remain 
very similar in design to current 
standard electric storage water heaters. 
Manufacturers could choose to produce 
the heat pump portion of the water 
heater in-house or purchase it from a 
supplier. GE has already announced that 
a heat pump water heater will be 
available sometime this year, and other 
major manufacturers are also developing 
heat pump water heaters. Given the 5- 
year delay in compliance date from the 
issuance of the final rule, and the fact 
that many manufacturers are already 
developing heat pump water heaters, 
DOE believes manufacturers may be 
able to convert their entire product lines 
before the compliance date of an 
amended energy conservation standard. 
However, DOE also recognizes there 
would likely be significant impacts on 
manufacturers. DOE considers those 
impacts in the MIA section of this 
NOPR (section IV.H). 
DOE is seeking comment on the 
manufacturability of heat pump water 
heaters and the capability of 
manufacturers to ramp up production. 
DOE is specifically seeking comment on 
how long it would take, and how much 
it would cost, for manufacturers to 
convert all product lines to heat pump 
water heaters if it were required by an 
amended energy conservation standard. 
Additionally, DOE is seeking comment 
about the capability of water heater 
installers and servicers to meet the 
unique demands created by heat pump 
water heaters. DOE is requesting 
comment about how long it would take 
to train installers and servicers to be 
able to serve the market created if heat 
pump water heaters were required by an 
amended energy conservation standard. 
DOE will consider all of these factors as 
it weighs the benefits and burdens of 
each TSL. (See Issue 11 under ‘‘Issues 
on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ in 
section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
c. General Comments 
DOE received several general 
comments about the current condition 
of heat pump water heater technology 
and the market for this product. These 
comments are discussed immediately 
below. 
Southern commented that, although 
not desirable, it would be less 
objectionable to require heat pump 
water heaters if the electric storage 
water heater class could be split at 40 
gallons, with products larger than 40 
gallons having a heat pump water heater 
efficiency level requirement, and 
products smaller than 40 gallons having 
a higher electric resistance efficiency 
level. (Southern, No. 50 at p. 4) 
EEI stated that there is a Federal tax 
credit for heat pump water heaters. (EEI, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 
60) AHRI stated that the ENERGY STAR 
program has been established since the 
previous rulemaking, creating greater 
recognition by all interested parties 
about the need to save energy. AHRI 
commented that every manufacturer is 
probably investigating whether it can 
maintain a feasible business providing 
heat pump water heaters. However, 
AHRI also commented that DOE should 
not consider heat pump water heaters as 
an energy conservation standard for 
2015. According to the commenter, the 
water heater industry and American 
consumers are experiencing difficult 
economic conditions, and consumers 
are not likely to purchase heat pump 
water heaters that are expensive. AHRI 
also stated that resistance-type electric 
storage water heaters are near their 
maximum efficiencies and need to 
evolve. AHRI commented that current 
conditions prohibit setting an efficiency 
minimum that would require a heat 
pump water heater. (AHRI, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 60– 
62) 
AHRI stated that current market 
conditions and the introduction of heat 
pump water heater models by water 
heater manufacturers are allowing heat 
pump water heaters to take root in the 
market. Further, AHRI asserted that the 
heat pump water heater market needs to 
mature and that DOE should allow the 
market and consumers to respond to the 
availability of higher-technology electric 
storage water heaters that are reliable 
and meet consumer utility needs. 
(AHRI, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at pp. 64–65) 
ACEEE stated that ENERGY STAR’s 
water heater program demonstrates that 
heat pump water heaters are viable. The 
commenter stated that three major 
manufacturers have announced or told 
ACEEE about a qualifying heat pump

water heater to be marketed to 
consumers in 2009, which is more than 
5 years before energy conservation 
standard would take effect. (ACEEE, No. 
35 at pp. 4–5) ACEEE asserted that cost- 
effectiveness should be examined 
because profits are likely to be greater 
for more expensive heat pump water 
heaters, even in a very competitive 
market, and that these higher cost 
products may benefit the industry in the 
current economic conditions. According 
to ACEEE, consumer preference can be 
very strong, and market studies show 
that consumers have a very 
sophisticated understanding of the 
benefits of very expensive heat pump 
water heaters. ACEEE noted that 
consumer preference has been seen for 
gas-condensing furnaces and other high- 
priced products in other markets that 
are considered commodity markets. 
(ACEEE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at p. 66) 
PG&E, SDGE, and SoCal Gas 
supported DOE’s decision to include 
integral heat pump water heaters as a 
max-tech efficiency level for electric 
storage water heaters. PG&E, SDGE, and 
SoCal Gas believe the heat pump water 
heater technology has made important 
advances in recent years and pointed to 
the actions of General Electric as a major 
manufacturer speaking to the viability of 
this technology. (PG&E, No. 38 at p. 2) 
NEEA and NPCC also agreed with the 
inclusion of heat pump water heaters in 
the rulemaking analyses, while 
acknowledging the failures issues 
discussed in the preliminary analyses. 
(NEEA and NPCC, No. 42 at p. 5) The 
American Gas Association (AGA) 
commented that there appear to be no 
significant barriers to including heat 
pump water heaters in the design 
options under consideration for electric 
storage water heaters. (AGA, No. 44 at 
p. 2) 
GE commented that heat pump water 
heaters have significant potential for 
increasing the energy efficiency of 
electric storage water heaters, but that 
shipments are currently very low (0.1 
percent of all water heaters shipped). 
According to GE, heat pump water 
heaters should be encouraged through 
ENERGY STAR and other consumer 
incentives to allow time for heat pump 
water heaters to penetrate the market 
and prove themselves in terms of energy 
cost savings and reliability. GE stated 
that the heat pump water heater market 
is too new to consider establishing a 
minimum standard at a level that would 
require heat pump water heater 
technology at this time. (GE, No. 51 at 
pp. 1–2) Southern also commented that 
levels requiring heat pump water heater 
technology are not appropriate as an 
amended energy conservation standard 
level at this time. (Southern, No. 50 at 
p. 4) 
DOE believes that the ENERGY STAR 
program and Federal tax credit program, 
along with recent developments in heat 
pump water heater technology due to 
manufacturers’ efforts, have made heat 
pump water heaters a much more viable 
technology for improving energy 
efficiency. As such, DOE is tentatively 
proposing to consider heat pump water 
heaters in this analysis as a design 
option for improving the efficiency of 
conventional electric storage water 
heaters. DOE considers the possibility of 
fuel switching resulting from heat pump 
water heater standards for electric 
storage water heaters in its shipments 
analysis (see section IV.F.1). 
The technologies evaluated in the 
screening analysis all have been used or 
are in use in commercially-available 
products, or exist in working 
prototypes. These technologies all 
incorporate materials and components 
that are commercially available in 
today’s supply markets for the products 
covered by this NOPR. Therefore, DOE 
believes all of the efficiency levels 
evaluated in this notice are 
technologically feasible. 
C. Engineering Analysis 
The engineering analysis develops 
cost-efficiency relationships to show the 
manufacturing costs of achieving 
increased efficiency. DOE has identified 
the following three methodologies to 
generate the manufacturing costs 
needed for the engineering analysis: (1) 
The design-option approach, which 
provides the incremental costs of adding 
to a baseline model design options that 
will improve its efficiency; (2) the 
efficiency-level approach, which 
provides the relative costs of achieving 
increases in energy efficiency levels, 
without regard to the particular design 
options used to achieve such increases; 
and (3) the cost-assessment (or reverse- 
engineering) approach, which provides 
‘‘bottom-up’’ manufacturing cost 
assessments for achieving various levels 
of increased efficiency, based on 
detailed data as to costs for parts and 
material, labor, shipping/packaging, and 
investment for models that operate at 
particular efficiency levels. 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
conducted the engineering analysis 
using both the efficiency level approach 
to identify incremental improvements in 
efficiency for each product and the cost- 
assessment approach to develop a cost 
for each efficiency level. DOE identified 
the most common residential heating 
products on the market and determined 
their corresponding efficiency levels, 
the component specifications, and the 
distinguishing technology features 
associated with those levels. After 
identifying the most common products 
that represent a cross section of the 
market, DOE gathered additional 
information using reverse-engineering 
methodologies; product information 
from manufacturer catalogs; and 
discussions with manufacturers and 
other experts of water heaters, DHE, and 
pool heaters. This approach provided 
useful information, including 
identification of potential technology 
paths manufacturers use to increase 
energy efficiency. 
DOE generated a bill of materials 
(BOM) by disassembling multiple 
manufacturers’ products that span a 
range of efficiency levels for each of the 
three product categories. The BOMs 
describe the product in detail, including 
all manufacturing steps required to 
make and/or assemble each part. 
Subsequently, DOE developed a cost 
model that converted the BOMs and 
efficiency levels into manufacturer 
production costs (MPCs). By applying 
derived manufacturer markups to the 
MPCs, DOE calculated the manufacturer 
selling prices and constructed industry 
cost-efficiency curves. 
DOE received several comments from 
interested parties on the approach to the 
engineering analysis. Rheem stated its 
support for DOE’s product teardown 
plan and evaluation of insulations 
levels. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 4) Southern 
agreed overall with the technical and 
engineering assumptions in the TSD. 
(Southern, No. 50 at p.1) 
Because DOE did not receive any 
comments from interested parties 
opposing its general approach to the 
engineering analysis, DOE continued to 
use the same approach for the NOPR 
phase of this rulemaking. However, DOE 
did receive specific comments from 
interested parties on certain aspects of 
the engineering analysis. A brief 
overview of the methodology, a 
discussion of the comments DOE 
received, DOE’s response to those 
comments, and any adjustments DOE 
made to the engineering analysis 
methodology or assumptions as a result 
of those comments is presented in the 
sections below. See chapter 5 of the 
NOPR TSD for additional details about 
the engineering analysis. 
1. Representative Products for Analysis 
For the engineering analysis, DOE 
reviewed all of the product classes of 
residential water heaters (storage-type 
and instantaneous), DHE, and pool 
heaters. Since the storage volume and 
input capacity affect the energy 
efficiency of residential heating

products, DOE examined each product 
type separately. Within each product 
type, DOE chose units for analysis that 
represent a cross section of the 
residential heating products market. The 
analysis of these representative products 
and product classes allowed DOE to 
identify specific characteristics that 
could be applied to all of the products 
across a range of storage and input 
capacities, as appropriate. 
a. Water Heaters 
For residential, storage-type water 
heaters, the volume of the tank 
significantly affects the amount of 
energy consumed, because it takes more 
energy to heat a larger volume of water 
from a given temperature to a higher 
temperature than it does to do the same 
for a smaller volume of water. Also, an 
increase in the tank volume can create 
an increase in the tank surface area, 
leading to higher standby losses of two 
otherwise identical tanks (i.e., same 
insulation thickness, same materials). 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
examined specific storage volumes for 
gas-fired, oil-fired, and electric storage 
water heaters (referred to as 
representative storage volumes and 
shown in Table IV.9) because the energy 
efficiency equations for residential 
water heaters established by EPCA are a 
function of each product’s storage 
volume. DOE reviewed the shipments 
data AHRI provided to determine the 
storage volume corresponding to the 
highest number of shipments for gas- 
fired water heaters, oil-fired water 
heaters, and electric water heaters. DOE 
conducted a similar review of shipment 
data for instantaneous gas-fired water 
heaters and determined the input rating 
corresponding to the highest number of 
shipments (i.e., 199,000 Btu/h, as shown 
in Table IV.9) since storage volume does 
not vary for this product class. 
DOE did not receive any comments in 
response to the preliminary analysis on 
the representative units for residential 
water heaters, and as such, used the 
same approach to determining 
representative units for the NOPR 
analysis. However, on review of the 
shipments for oil-fired storage water 
heaters for the NOPR analysis, DOE 
determined that oil-fired storage water 
heaters with 32 gallons of storage 
volume have a higher number of 
shipments than those with 30 gallons, 
and adjusted the representative unit 
accordingly.

Oil-fired Storage Type ............................................................................................................................................... 32 
Instantaneous Gas Fired ........................................................................................................................................... 0 
(199,000 Btu/h input capacity) 
Once DOE conducted the primary 
analysis on the representative rated 
storage volumes for each of the product 
classes, DOE extended the analysis to 
other rated storage volumes using the 
cost model and the energy efficiency 
equations. See section IV.C.7 for 
additional details. For gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, DOE used 
the analysis for the 199 kBtu/h input 
capacity and applied it to all products 
within the product class. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
Current energy conservation 
standards for DHE are not determined 
by an equation, but by input capacity 
ranges. DOE examined one specific 
input capacity range for gas wall fan, gas 
wall gravity, gas floor, and gas room 
DHE in the preliminary analysis. In 
addition, DOE examined one specific 
input capacity range for gas hearth DHE 
in the NOPR analysis. The specific 
input ranges DOE analyzed are referred 
to as representative input rating ranges. 
DOE reviewed the DHE (including 
vented hearth products) shipment data 
AHRI and HPBA provided for this 
rulemaking and found the input rating 
range corresponding to the highest 
number of shipments for gas wall fan, 
gas wall gravity, gas floor, and gas room 
DHE. DOE did not receive any 
comments from interested parties in 
response to the preliminary analysis on 
the representative ranges for traditional 
DHE, and used the same approach to 
determine the ranges for the NOPR 
analysis. DOE did not receive shipments 
data categorized by capacity ranges for 
gas hearth DHE, and, therefore, 
determined the representative capacity 
range based on the number of models 
available on the market in each capacity 
range. DOE added a representative range 
for gas hearth DHE for the NOPR 
analysis. In addition, after reorganizing 
the DHE product classes, DOE reviewed 
gas room DHE shipments for the NOPR, 
and changed the representative input 
range for gas room DHE from over 
46,000 Btu/h to between 27,000 and 
46,000 Btu/h. DOE found the input 
range between 27,000 and 46,000 Btu/h 
contained the highest number of models 
for gas room DHE when the gas hearth 
DHE were removed from consideration. 
Table IV.10 presents the representative 
rated input rating ranges for residential 
DHE. For the remaining DHE product 
classes (i.e., wall fan, wall gravity, and 
floor), DOE did not receive any 
comments in response to the 
preliminary analysis on the 
representative units, and, therefore, 
used the same units for the NOPR 
analysis.

65881 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
After analyzing the representative 
product class (i.e., input rating range), 
DOE applied the analysis to the 
remaining product classes for each 
residential DHE type. Unlike storage 
water heaters, an equation is not applied 
to relate the range of input ratings. 
Instead, DOE proposes to maintain the 
AFUE difference between each input 
rating range as established by EPCA. 
That is, if the amended energy 
conservation standard is increased by 
two AFUE percentage points for the 
representative product class, for 
example, the amended energy 
conservation standards for the other 
product classes within this product type 
would all rise by two AFUE percentage 
points. The stringency resulting from an 
amended standard is constant across the 
range of inputs for a given product type. 
This approach appears to be consistent 
with the relationship between input 
capacity and efficiency exhibited by 
models currently available on the 
market based on DOE’s review of the 
AHRI directory for DHE. In addition, 
DOE notes that the larger DHE units 
usually contain larger heat exchangers 
to get higher efficiencies. These larger 
heat exchangers have increased surface 
area, which also increases the convected 
losses to the surroundings. The 
increased losses result in lower AFUEs. 
Based on the market assessment and 
engineering principles, DOE believes 
the approach for maintaining the AFUE 
difference between each input rating 
range is reasonable. 
c. Pool Heaters 
There is only one product class for 
residential gas-fired pool heaters, but 
this product class covers a wide range 
of input ratings. Although within the 
same product class, the variation in 
input rating is large enough to create 
variations in pool heater design (e.g., 
large variations in input will vary 
material usage and MPC). Therefore, for 
the preliminary analysis, DOE reviewed 
the shipment data from AHRI and found 
the input rating corresponding to the 
highest number of shipments, which 
was 250,000 Btu/h input rating. Because 
DOE did not receive any comments on 
the representative input rating in the 
preliminary analysis, DOE used the 
same approach for the NOPR analysis. 
Consequently, DOE used 250,000 Btu/h 
as the representative input rating for 
residential pool heaters in the NOPR 
analysis. 
The engineering analysis results for 
the representative product classes are 
used in the remaining DOE analyses, 
including the life-cycle cost analysis 
and the national impact analysis. 
2. Ultra-Low NOX Gas-Fired Storage 
Water Heaters 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE did 
not address ultra-low NOX gas-fired 
storage water heaters separately from 
gas-fired storage water heaters with 
standard burners (i.e., non-ultra-low 
NOX burner). DOE developed a single 
cost-efficiency curve for all gas-fired 
storage water heaters. However, DOE 
received several comments in response 
to the preliminary analysis on the cost 
of ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage water 
heaters. As discussed in section IV.A.3.a 
above, several local air quality 
management districts (mostly in 
California) limit the allowable NOX 
emissions from residential water 
heaters. 
BWC commented that there is a 
substantial cost increase to comply with 
the ultra-low NOX requirements. (BWC, 
No. 46 at p.1) Rheem commented that 
the MPC and MSP did not capture 
higher costs and prices associated with 
models that comply with ultra-low NOX 
requirements. (Rheem, No. 49 at pp. 4, 
7) Rheem stated that although DOE 
included the costs associated with 
Flammable Vapor Ignition Resistant 
(FVIR) technology, DOE did not, but 
should have, included the costs 
associated with ultra-low NOX 
emissions requirements in its analysis. 
Further, Rheem stated that given the 
continued adoption of ultra-low NOX 
requirements in highly-populated 
regions such as California and Texas, 
DOE should revise its baseline cost 
estimates and include weighting for the 
population subject to ultra-low NOX 
regulations. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 7) 
A.O. Smith stated that the types of 
burners currently used to comply with 
the ultra-low NOX requirements in an 
atmospheric water heater are much 
more restrictive (i.e., produce higher 
pressure drops) than conventional 
burners. According to the commenter, 
since gas-fired storage water heaters 
complying with the ultra-low NOX 
requirements also must comply with 
FVIR requirements, the units must also 
have flame arrestors on the air inlet, 
which further restricts the system. To 
boost the efficiency of ultra-low NOX 
gas-fired storage water heaters, 
manufacturers typically make the flue 
baffle more effective. In certain 
instances, given these additional 
restrictions, the only way for some of 
these units to continue to meet the 
energy conservation standards is to add 
a blower and/or power burner to the 
heater, which would greatly increase the 
manufacturing and installation costs. 
(A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 9) SoCal Gas 
agreed with the storage manufacturers, 
stating that ultra-low NOX requirements 
similar to those in the Southern 
California Air Quality Management 
District are being implemented in other 
regions. SoCal Gas stated that ultra-low 
NOX requirements necessitate a 
different type of product, which creates 
a cost issue because product costs and 
cost increases are dramatically higher. 
(SoCal Gas, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 34.4 at pp. 41–42) 
In response to the comments on the 
preliminary analysis, DOE developed a 
separate analysis for ultra-low NOX gas- 
fired storage water heaters. DOE 
developed cost-efficiency curves for 
ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage water 
heaters by performing a teardown 
analysis (section IV.C.4.a) of several 
ultra-low NOX products from a variety 
of manufacturers at several efficiency 
levels. More specifically, DOE analyzed 
ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage water 
heaters at a 40-gallon representative 
storage volume, as was done for gas- 
fired storage water heaters with a 
standard burner. DOE then compared 
the ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage 
water heaters to the comparable gas- 
fired storage water heaters that use 
standard burner technology (i.e., not 
ultra-low NOX compliant). DOE also 
considered the impact of ultra-low NOX 
regulations for the cumulative 
regulatory burden (see section V.B.2.f). 
DOE used the cost-efficiency curves 
for ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage 
water heaters in the downstream 
analysis, including the LCC. DOE 
distributed the costs based on those 
geographical areas with ultra-low NOX 
regulations. See chapter 5 of the NOPR 
TSD for the cost-efficiency curves for 
ultra-low NOX gas-fired storage water 
heaters. 
3. Efficiency Levels Analyzed 
For each of the representative 
products, DOE analyzed multiple 
efficiency levels and estimated 
manufacturer production costs at each 
efficiency level. The following 
subsections provide a description of the 
full efficiency level range DOE analyzed 
from the baseline efficiency level to the 
maximum technologically feasible (max- 
tech) efficiency level for each product 
class. In some cases, the highest 
efficiency level was identified through 
review of available product literature or 
prototypes for products not 
commercially available. 
For each product class, DOE selected 
baseline units as reference points, 
against which DOE measured changes 
resulting from potential amended 
energy conservation standards. 
Generally, the baseline unit in each 
product class: (1) Represents the basic

characteristics of equipment in that 
class; (2) just meets current Federal 
energy conservation standards; and (3) 
provides basic consumer utility. 
DOE conducted a survey of the 
residential heating products market to 
determine what types of products are 
available to consumers and to identify 
the efficiency levels corresponding to 
the highest number of models. Then, 
DOE established intermediate energy 
efficiency levels for each of the product 
classes that are representative of 
efficiencies that are typically available 
on the market or correspond to 
voluntary program targets such as 
ENERGY STAR. DOE reviewed AHRI’s 
product certification directory, 
manufacturer catalogs, and other 
publicly-available literature to 
determine which efficiency levels are 
the most prevalent for each 
representative product class. 
DOE determined the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency that is 
technologically feasible (max-tech) for 
water heaters, DHE, and pool heaters, as 
required by section 325(o) of EPCA. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)). For the representative 
product within a given product class, 
DOE could not identify any working 
products or prototypes at higher 
efficiency levels that were currently 
available beyond the identified max- 
tech level at the time the analysis was 
performed. DOE seeks comment on its 
max-tech efficiency levels. 
Rheem commented generally in 
response to the preliminary analysis 
about the water heater max-tech levels 
DOE identified. Rheem asserted that 
there is little to no presence of max-tech 
water heating products in the United 
States. Further, Rheem commented that 
it supports the growth of max-tech 
products through ENERGY STAR, 
which helps to distinguish top- 
performing products and to stimulate 
market transformation, but the 
commenter stated that max-tech should 
not be considered for a Federal 
minimum standard. (Rheem, No. 49 at 
p. 2) 
NRDC commented that max-tech 
levels face issues that are similar for all 
emerging technologies. It noted that: (1) 
Max-tech products are only produced 
and deployed on small scales, thereby 
limiting available data; (2) reliability is 
a concern, possibly due to small scale 
production; (3) costs are high but 
projected to decrease as production 
increases, although timing is unknown; 
(4) consumer reaction to new 
technologies and their amenities is 
unknown; and (5) units are more useful 
only in certain applications due to size, 
venting, or other inherent attributes. 
NRDC notes that DOE must consider all 
of these concerns when making a 
decision. (NRDC, No. 48 at pp. 1–2) 
As stated above, EPCA requires DOE 
to determine the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency or 
maximum reduction in energy use that 
is technologically feasible for each class 
of covered products. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)). 
Therefore, DOE must consider and 
include an analysis of max-tech levels 
for residential heating products in this 
rulemaking. However, DOE notes that 
consideration of the max-tech level does 
not necessarily mean that it will be 
adopted as the level in the energy 
conservation standard for that product, 
because DOE must consider, in turn, all 
of the other statutory factors under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o). 
In addition to identifying efficiency 
levels for each product class, DOE 
identified a particular technology or 
combination of technologies associated 
with each efficiency level in order to 
make the engineering analysis more 
transparent to interested parties. For 
each efficiency level, DOE lists 
technology and design changes 
manufacturers could use to improve 
product energy efficiency to achieve the 
given efficiency level. These 
technologies provide methods to 
increase product energy and are 
representative of technologies found in 
a typical model at a given efficiency 
level. While DOE recognizes that 
manufacturers use many different 
technologies and approaches to increase 
the energy efficiency of residential 
heating products, the presented 
technologies and combinations of 
technologies and their ordering are 
simply possible paths manufacturers 
could use to reach higher efficiency 
levels. 
a. Water Heaters 
The current Federal minimum energy 
conservation standards define the 
baseline efficiencies for residential 
water heaters as measured by the energy 
factor. These standards became effective 
on January 20, 2004. (10 CFR Part 
430.32(d)) For water heaters, DOE 
applied the representative storage 
capacity to the energy efficiency 
equations in 10 CFR Part 430.32(d) to 
calculate the EFs of the baseline units. 
i. Gas-Fired Storage Water Heaters 
As described in section IV.C.2, DOE 
performed a separate analysis for gas- 
fired water heaters with a standard 
burner and gas-fired water heaters with 
an ultra-low NOX burner for this NOPR. 
Table IV.11 and Table IV.12 show the 
efficiency levels DOE considered for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, along 
with the technologies that 
manufacturers could use to achieve the 
listed efficiencies. The technologies for 
standard burner gas-fired water heaters 
and ultra-low NOX gas-fired water 
heaters vary due to differences in the 
operating characteristics of the burners. 
Ultra-low NOX burners typically reduce 
the pressure in the flue, which can 
create problems if the pressures 
required to properly vent combustion 
products are not maintained. To 
mitigate these problems, manufacturers 
may reduce the amount of baffling or 
other airflow restrictions to ensure 
proper venting, which in turn may 
result in decreased efficiency. To 
overcome these issues, manufacturers 
must use power venting technology to 
achieve energy factors that are 
comparable to what they would achieve 
with a standard burner gas-fired storage 
water heater that can contain more 
baffling. Therefore, the technologies 
associated with ultra-low NOX gas-fired 
water heaters are implemented at lower 
efficiency levels and yield a lower 
energy factor than the same technologies 
associated with gas-fired storage water 
heaters that use a standard burner.

DOE found gas-fired storage water 
heaters capable of condensing 
operations at the highest efficiency level 
(i.e., max-tech). More energy can be 
extracted by condensing the combustion 
products in the flue gas, which extracts 
more heat in the form of latent energy, 
leading to an increase in the thermal 
efficiency of the gas-fired storage water 
heater. In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
identified the max-tech EF for 
condensing gas-fired storage water 
heaters as 0.77. DOE received several 
comments from interested parties 
(discussed below) which have caused 
DOE to revise its estimate upwards to 
0.80 EF for condensing units. 
NRDC stated that condensing gas-fired 
water heaters are the future of gas-fired 
storage water heaters. (NRDC, No. 48 at 
p. 1) ACEEE commented that the max- 
tech efficiency level DOE considered for 
gas-fired storage water heaters is lower 
than the ENERGY STAR level for the 
condensing storage water heater 
category, which is set at 0.80 EF. ACEEE 
stated that selecting 0.77 EF from a 
range of identified energy factors for 
condensing gas-fired storage water 
heaters ranging from 0.77 to 0.82 EF will 
bias the results of the analysis and that 
the five percentage points of the energy 
factor correspond to less gas usage. 
ACEEE expressed concern with such a 
divergence between ENERGY STAR and 
the energy conservation standards 
rulemaking. (ACEEE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 75–76) 
Further, ACEEE recommended that DOE 
analyze efficiency levels at 0.77 EF, 0.80 
EF, and 0.82 EF for gas-fired storage 
water heaters (ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 3) 
ASAP stated that DOE’s analysis may be 
missing some efficiency levels. For gas- 
fired storage water heaters in particular, 
ASAP commented that condensing units 
may span a range of efficiencies, and a 
0.77 EF may be an intermediate level 
that is not max-tech. (ASAP, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 92) 
A.O. Smith stated its support for the 
max-tech efficiency levels for water 
heaters as shown in the preliminary 
engineering analysis. Specifically, A.O. 
Smith supports a 0.77 EF for gas-fired 
condensing water heaters, which meets 
DOE’s criteria of being technically 
feasible. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 3) 
In selecting the efficiency level for the 
max-tech condensing gas-fired water 
heater for the NOPR analysis, DOE 
carefully considered all comments from 
interested parties regarding this issue. 
There are no products currently 
available on the residential gas-fired 
storage water heater market that can 
achieve the efficiencies that will be 
made possible by condensing 
technology, and, therefore, it is difficult 
to determine the highest possible EF 
that can be achieved using this 
technology. Although condensing gas- 
fired storage water heaters are not 
currently available on the market in 
residential sizes, they are available in 
commercial sizes that could be scaled 
down for residential use. Commercial 
condensing gas-fired storage water 
heaters have efficiencies of up to 96 
percent thermal efficiency. There is no 
direct mathematical conversion that can 
be used to derive energy factor (the 
efficiency metric for residential water 
heaters) from thermal efficiency (the 
efficiency metric used for commercial 
water heaters). Therefore, in making the 
determination of a max-tech level for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, DOE 
considered feedback from interested 
parties, information gathered during 
manufacturer interviews, available 
reports and literature, and its own 
technical expertise. As a result, DOE has 
revised the max-tech water heater 
efficiency to 0.80 EF for the NOPR 
analysis. This level is cited as the max- 
tech for condensing water heaters in 
several reports reviewed by DOE 
(described in more detail below), and 
DOE believes it is the maximum 
possible energy factor that can possibly 
be achieved by a gas-fired storage water 
heater at this time. DOE notes that A.O. 
Smith presentation given at the 2009 
ACEEE Hot Water Forum identifies 0.80 
EF as the maximum possible EF for 
residential condensing gas-fired water 
heaters. For more information visit 
http://www.aceee.org; the presentation 
is available at: http://www.aceee.org/ 
conf/09whforum/PlenarySession1- 
AdamsPresentation.pdf. 
In addition, the Super Efficient Gas 
Water Heating Appliance Initiative 
(SEGWHAI) Final Project Report (April 
2007) identified efficiency factors at 
0.80 and above as achievable 
condensing efficiency levels for gas- 
fired storage water heaters, although 
these levels were based on theoretical 
modeling of gas-fired water heaters and 
have never been demonstrated in 
working prototypes. For more 
information, visit http:// 
www.segwhai.org. A 0.80 EF level is also 
consistent with the max-tech level 
identified by ENERGY STAR in its 
determination of an appropriate 
efficiency level for gas-fired storage 
water heaters utilizing condensing 
technology. For more information, visit 
http://www.energystar.gov. As 
explained above, DOE seeks comment 
on the max-tech efficiency levels 
identified for the analyses, especially 
those for gas-fired water heaters. (See 
Issue 1 under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE 
Seeks Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
DOE received several comments about 
the other efficiency levels and 
technologies identified for the 
preliminary analysis. 
Southern commented on the 
technologies for efficiency level 3 for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, stating 
its belief that adding electronic ignition 
would not require manufacturers to use 
power vent systems. (Southern, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 87) 
DOE agrees with Southern’s comment, 
because an assessment of the current 
market demonstrates that gas-fired 
storage water heaters using electronic 
ignition systems do not always include 
power vent technologies. However, DOE 
believes many manufacturers that use 
power vent technologies to reach 
efficiency level 3, 4, and 5 also use 
electronic ignition systems since the fan 
already requires electricity. Therefore, 
DOE paired electronic ignition and 
power venting technologies with one 
inch of insulation as a potential 
approach to achieving efficiency level 3. 
DOE believes that manufacturers 
implement designs that have both 
electronic ignition and power vent

technology at this efficiency level. At 
efficiency levels 1 and 2, DOE used 
standing pilot systems for gas-fired 
storage water heaters, which do not 
require line electricity. Even though 
efficiency level 3 and above for gas-fired 
storage water heaters would require 
consumers to have an external electrical 
connection, DOE has determined that 
consumers would continue to have 
other non-electrical alternatives such as 
other types of gas-fired water heaters 
(e.g., gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters). 
ACEEE stated that DOE should 
include an efficiency level that 
considers flue and vent damper 
technologies instead of power vent 
technology. The commenter stated that 
this may not significantly affect the 
energy factor because the test procedure 
does not account for the value of 
entrained bypass air. ACEEE asserted 
that flue and vent dampers may have 
much lower costs than power vents and 
may have less entrained air. Further, 
ACEEE stated that flue and vent 
dampers do not require exhaust 
temperatures to be reduced to a level 
that can be handled by PVC plastics. 
(ACEEE, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at p. 88) 
DOE focused its analysis on 
technologies that would impact 
efficiency, as measured by the DOE test 
procedure. DOE discussed its 
consideration of damper technologies as 
part of the screening analysis in section 
IV.B.1.a. For the engineering analysis, 
DOE examined the most common 
methods used by manufacturers to 
improve energy factor, as determined 
using DOE’s test procedures specified in 
10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix E. 
Through its reverse-engineering 
analysis, and review of manufacturer 
literature, DOE found that 
manufacturers most often use power 
vent technology to achieve higher 
efficiency for gas-fired storage water 
heaters. Thus, DOE considered 
efficiency levels that are typically 
achieved using a power vent design in 
the NOPR analysis. 
Rheem commented that at the 
preliminary analysis efficiency level 5 
(i.e., 0.66 EF), gas-fired storage water 
heaters may require operation at and 
near condensing efficiency levels, 
which can be undesirable. (Rheem, No. 
49 at p. 4) 
DOE notes that several manufacturers 
already manufacture water heaters at 
0.66 EF, making gas-fired storage water 
heaters at 0.66 EF practical to 
manufacture, install, and service, and 
technologically feasible. DOE is 
unaware of any adverse impacts to 
either product utility or health and 
safety that would result from a water 
heater at 0.66 EF. DOE reviewed the 
market for gas-fired water heaters at 0.66 
EF and 0.67 EF. DOE did not find any 
products currently on the market, which 
incorporate features to accommodate 
condensing operation. Therefore, DOE 
sees no reason to eliminate that 
efficiency level from consideration. 
However, DOE did revise efficiency 
level 5 from 0.66 EF for the preliminary 
analysis to 0.67 EF for the NOPR 
analysis to maintain consistency with 
the ENERGY STAR Program. DOE notes 
there are also products currently offered 
with a 0.67 EF at the representative 
volume size. 
Rheem also stated that the 
technologies identified to increase 
energy efficiency for gas-fired storage 
water heaters are appropriate. However, 
Rheem asserted that the insulation 
thicknesses that would be required to 
achieve efficiency levels 1, 2, and 3 are 
understated. Rheem commented that 
efficiency level 1 requires 2 to 2.5 
inches of insulation, for example. 
(Rheem, No. 49 at p. 4) 
DOE research suggests that the tank 
thicknesses listed at various efficiency 
levels are consistent with products 
available on the market. DOE reviewed 
manufacturer literature, which typically 
includes information on energy factor 
and insulation thicknesses. For the 
preliminary analysis, DOE reverse- 
engineered several gas-fired water 
heaters to verify the technologies used 
to improve energy efficiency, including 
insulation thicknesses. Since the 
preliminary analysis, DOE also hired an 
independent testing facility to 
determine the EF of a representative 
sample of water heaters across multiple 
efficiency levels for the NOPR. These 
water heaters were subsequently 
disassembled to verify the technologies 
used to increase energy efficiency. In 
the end, DOE came to the same 
conclusions as in the preliminary 
analysis regarding insulation 
thicknesses. Therefore, DOE believes the 
results of its assessment of insulation 
thicknesses at various efficiency levels 
are accurate. 
Rheem also commented that baseline 
technologies for 40-gallon gas-fired 
storage water heaters do not apply 
uniformly for the entire range of rated 
storage volumes, and as such, DOE 
should account for the additional 
manufacturing, installation, and 
shipping costs for larger size water 
heaters. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 4) 
For the NOPR engineering analysis, 
DOE performed teardowns of models at 
multiple nominal capacities and noted 
any differences (including minor 
differences) that occurred. DOE used the 
knowledge gained from these teardowns 
when it extended the cost analysis to 
the other capacity (gallon) sizes. As part 
of its analysis, DOE accounted for 
additional installation costs and 
shipping costs of larger units (see 
sections IV.E.2.a and IV.C.4.f, 
respectively). 
ii. Electric Storage Water Heaters 
Table IV.13 shows the efficiency 
levels considered for electric storage 
water heaters, along with their 
corresponding potential technologies 
that could be used to achieve those 
levels.

have been certified under the ENERGY 
STAR program, and others are currently 
under development by other water 
heater manufacturers. DOE found 
electric heat pump water heaters 
capable of obtaining EFs of 2.2 in the 
preliminary analysis and retained this 
level as the max-tech level in the NOPR 
analysis. DOE received several 
comments on the efficiency levels and 
technologies presented in the 
preliminary analysis. 
NRDC commented that heat pump 
water heaters are the future of electric 
storage water heater technology. (NRDC, 
No. 48 at p. 1) ASAP stated that DOE 
may be missing some efficiency levels 
in its analysis. ASAP commented that 
an efficiency level between efficiency 
level 5 and the max-tech for electric 
storage water heaters may merit 
analysis, particularly if ENERGY STAR 
has a heat pump water heater at 2.0 EF. 
(ASAP, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at p. 92) Similarly, ACEEE 
recommended DOE analyze levels at 1.7 
EF, 2.0 EF, and 2.2 EF. (ACEEE, No. 35 
at p. 3) Additionally, ACEEE stated that 
prior analyses have been conducted for 
heat pump water heaters at 2.5 EF, 
although further specifics were not 
provided. (ACEEE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 94) BWC 
referred DOE to comments made during 
the previous residential water heater 
rulemaking on July 18, 1994. (BWC, No. 
46 at p. 2) BWC asserted that the 
previous rulemaking stated a reasonable 
energy factor of 1.50, but that the 
current rulemaking does not. BWC 
stated its belief that 1.5 EF is still a 
reasonable EF for heat pump water 
heaters. (BWC, No. 46 at p. 2) 
In response to these comments, DOE 
revised the efficiency levels considered 
for electric storage water heaters to 
include an intermediate heat pump 
water heater efficiency level at 2.0 EF 
for the NOPR analysis. This is not the 
max-tech level, but it does represent a 
significant change in technology and 
increase in efficiency over the 
traditional electric storage heater 
technology. This technology would also 
be easier for manufacturers to achieve 
than the max-tech 2.2 EF. DOE notes 
this efficiency level also corresponds to 
the level set forth by the ENERGY STAR 
program. DOE did not find any heat 
pump water heaters currently available 
or in the research stage with a 1.7 EF. 
In addition, DOE believes it is unlikely 
that manufacturers will offer products 
below the ENERGY STAR level, which 
is at 2.0 EF. Currently, there are also 
Federal tax credits for heat pump water 
heaters with an energy factor greater 
than or equal to 2.0 EF. Additionally, 
DOE maintained 2.2 EF as the max-tech 
efficiency level. Although ACEEE 
commented that analysis has been 
performed on heat pump water heaters 
with EFs of up to 2.5, ACEEE did not 
indicate the source of this analysis, and 
DOE could not identify any heat pump 
water heaters at 2.5 EF through its 
research efforts. The highest EF 
obtained in prototype designs currently 
being developed is 2.2 EF. 
In response to the technology options 
presented in the preliminary analysis, 
AHRI stated that increasing the 
insulation on an electric storage water 
heater from 3 to 4 inches would not 
increase the energy factor of such 
magnitude by 0.01 EF point. AHRI does 
not believe that an increase in the 
energy factor would be seen using 
DOE’s test procedure when only the 
insulation thickness is increased and no 
other design changes are made to 
eliminate many of the thermal short 
circuits present in a water heater. 
(AHRI, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at pp. 90–91) Rheem also 
commented that DOE should recognize 
that there are diminishing returns for 
added foam insulation, adding that it is 
unclear how the efficiency levels for 
electric storage water heaters with 3 and 
4 inches of insulation were evaluated to 
yield the proposed efficiency levels. 
(Rheem, No. 49 at p. 3) 
DOE research determined the 
technology options manufacturers 
typically use to improve product 
efficiency, and was based on multiple 
data sources including manufacturer 
literature, which usually includes 
information on energy factor and 
insulation thicknesses. DOE also 
conducted a teardown analysis of 
electric storage water heaters for the 
preliminary analysis. For the NOPR 
analysis, DOE tested the EF of water 
heaters and then performed a teardown 
analysis on those water heaters across 
various EF ratings to confirm the 
technologies used for increasing 
efficiency. Although insulation 
thickness is not the only design change, 
DOE believes it is the driving factor in 
increasing the EF for electric storage 
water heaters, and, therefore, is listed as 
a commonly used technology option. 
For these reasons, DOE did not revise 
the technology options for EL4 and EL 
5 for electric storage water heaters for 
the NOPR analysis. 
iii. Oil-Fired Storage Water Heaters 
Table IV.14 presents the efficiency 
levels DOE considered for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, along with the 
technology options that manufacturers 
could use to achieve the listed 
efficiency. 
TABLE IV.14—THIRTY-TWO-GALLON OIL-FIRED STORAGE WATER HEATER WITH BURNER ASSEMBLY

Efficiency Level 3 (EF = 0.58) .................................................................. 2.5″ Fiberglass Insulation.

Efficiency Level 7¥Max-Tech (EF = 0.68) .............................................. 1″ Foam Insulation, and Multi Flue Design. 
The most efficient residential oil-fired 
storage water heater on the market has 
an EF of 0.68 and includes electronic 
ignition, foam insulation, and enhanced 
flue baffles. DOE considered this 
efficiency level in the preliminary 
analysis and did not revise it for the 
NOPR analysis. However, DOE has 
determined that all oil-fired water 
heaters currently manufactured at the 
max-tech efficiency level incorporate a 
proprietary design. While DOE typically 
does not consider proprietary designs in 
its analysis due to impacts on 
competition likely to result from setting 
a minimum standard an efficiency level 
that is only achievable using a 
proprietary design, the agency has 
determined through discussions with 
manufacturers and its own technical 
expertise that the max-tech level for oil- 
fired storage water heaters is achievable 
using alternative approaches that are not 
proprietary. Therefore, DOE included

this efficiency level in the NOPR 
analysis. DOE believes manufacturers of 
oil-fired storage water heaters could 
achieve an EF of 0.68 by using a 
multiple flue design consisting of 
several flues to increase the heat transfer 
area, instead of a single, central flue that 
is standard on nearly all residential gas- 
fired and oil-fired storage water heaters. 
DOE revised its cost analysis for a 0.66 
EF and 0.68 EF to represent a non- 
proprietary, multiple flue design. 
DOE did not receive any comments in 
response to the preliminary analysis on 
the max-tech efficiency level or the 
other efficiency levels DOE considered 
for oil-fired storage water heaters. See 
chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD for more 
information about the efficiency levels 
DOE analyzed for oil-fired storage water 
heaters. 
iv. Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water 
Heaters 
Table IV.15 presents the efficiency 
levels DOE considered for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, along with 
their corresponding potential 
technologies. 
TABLE IV.15—ZERO-GALLON GAS-FIRED INSTANTANEOUS WATER HEATER, 199,000 BTU/H INPUT CAPACITY 
Efficiency level (EF) Technology 
Baseline (EF = 0.62) ................................................................................ Standing Pilot.

Efficiency Level 2 (EF = 0.78) .................................................................. Electronic Ignition and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
Efficiency Level 3 (EF = 0.80) .................................................................. Electronic Ignition and Power Vent. 
Efficiency Level 4 (EF = 0.82) .................................................................. Electronic Ignition, Power Vent, Improved Heat Exchanger Area.

Efficiency Level 8 ¥ Max Tech (EF = 0.95) ............................................ Electronic Ignition, Power Vent, Direct Vent, Condensing (Max-Tech). 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
identified a gas-fired instantaneous 
water heater capable of condensing with 
an EF of 0.92 as the max-tech level. DOE 
did not receive any comments on the 
max-tech gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters. However, on reviewing the gas- 
fired instantaneous water heater market, 
DOE identified a new max-tech level at 
0.95 EF for instantaneous gas-fired 
water heaters that use condensing 
technology. 
DOE received several comments on 
the potential technologies incorporated 
at each efficiency level for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters that were 
presented in its preliminary engineering 
analysis. For the preliminary analysis, 
DOE considered the baseline to be the 
current Federal minimum standard (i.e., 
0.62 EF). Also, DOE did not incorporate 
the need to handle condensate into the 
installed cost estimates until products 
reached the 0.92 efficiency level for the 
preliminary analysis. 
A.O. Smith suggested using a higher 
EF as the baseline efficiency level for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters. 
A.O. Smith noted that the vast majority 
of models available (per the AHRI 
Directory) are already well above the 
Federal minimum energy conservation 
standards of 0.62 EF. Since the majority 
of shipments in the current market for 
tank-type water heaters are at the 
Federal minimum energy conservation 
standards, DOE should use the same 
logic in choosing the baseline efficiency 
levels. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 3) 
In response, DOE defines the baseline 
efficiency level as representative of the 
basic characteristics of equipment in 
that class. The characteristics of a gas- 
fired instantaneous water heater that 
just meets the 0.62 EF requirement 
would be representative of the most 
basic design that could be used for a 
gas-fired instantaneous water heater. 
Therefore, DOE did not change the 
baseline efficiency level for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters in the 
NOPR analysis. 
At the public meeting for the 
preliminary analysis, DOE sought 
comment on safety concerns for gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters at 
near-condensing efficiency levels. 
Operating at near-condensing levels 
may result in corrosive condensation 
formation, which may occur when the 
combustion products (which include 
water vapor) cool and condense. 
Manufacturers stated during engineering 
interviews that there is a safety margin 
needed to account for variations due to 
manufacturing tolerances, gas quality, 
differences in venting configurations, 
altitude, ambient conditions, and 
installer experience. DOE specifically 
requested information about how 
manufacturers would change current 
designs to mitigate corrosive condensate 
formation at near-condensing EF levels 
that may be present in some 
installations. DOE also requested 
comment about how manufacturers 
would alter current designs of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters to achieve 
safe operation if a potential amended 
standard required all installations to 
operate at near-condensing EF levels. 
In response, Noritz stated that 0.83 EF 
is generally the borderline between 
condensing and non-condensing, the 
point at which units begin operating in 
condensing mode in at least some 
applications. (Noritz, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 113) Noritz 
also stated that condensation may occur 
in the near condensing range, which 
includes 0.83, 0.84, and 0.85 EF, and 
that it would change the copper heat 
exchanger in its standard product to 
stainless steel or better to manage the 
acidic condensate. (Noritz, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 108– 
109) Noritz recommends that 
contractors install a condensate 
collector for instantaneous gas-fired 
water heaters with energy factors at 0.82 
and 0.83, but acknowledged that the 
condensate collector is not included in 
a large percentage of installations. 
Therefore, Noritz stated that it would 
include a stainless steel heat exchanger 
with the condensate collector on higher 
efficiency products because of the 
increased safety issues associated with 
condensate management. (Noritz, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 111– 
112) Further, Noritz said it would use 
this stainless steel heat exchanger 
nationwide for cost considerations and 
to keep the product standard. (Noritz, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at 
pp. 109–110) Noritz commented that it 
handles acidic condensation with a 
stainless steel heat exchanger for the 
condensing instantaneous gas-fired 
water heater that has an energy factor of 
0.92 EF, and that the product uses a 
primary copper heat exchanger and a 
secondary stainless steel heat 
exchanger. Noritz commented that some 
companies may use titanium, but this 
may not be realistic for Noritz because 
of the cost. (Noritz, Public Meeting

Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 109–110) In 
written comments, Noritz suggested that 
DOE’s cost-efficiency curve should be 
continuous from 0.62 to 0.82, at which 
point there should be a kink in the 
curve, and the cost of producing a 
product with an EF of 0.83 or higher 
would see a steep increase. According to 
the commenter, the delineation between 
condensing and non-condensing 
product gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters is at an EF of 0.83, which is 
borderline. Noritz asserted that 
manufacturers making products with an 
EF of 0.83 or above would need to 
design these products to deal with 
condensate, thereby requiring more 
expensive heat exchanger materials, 
condensate drains, and some method of 
treating (i.e., neutralizing) the 
condensate for safe disposal. (Noritz, 
No. 36 at pp. 1–2) 
Similar to Noritz’s comments, AHRI 
noted that the costs of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters at near- 
condensing efficiency levels (i.e., an EF 
of 0.84 and 0.85) need to include the 
measures manufacturers would use to 
minimize problems associated with 
excessive condensate in the appliance 
or its venting system. Specifically, AHRI 
noted that manufacturers must build 
safety factors into their designs to 
address the wide scope of installation 
conditions, such as colder incoming 
water temperatures or various venting 
systems. AHRI recommended that DOE 
model the heat exchanger using more 
corrosive-resistant materials, specifying 
a venting system using stainless steel, 
and adding a means to collect and 
dispose of condensate. (AHRI, No. 43 at 
p. 2) Regarding manufacturing products 
that operate near their condensing 
levels, AHRI stated that manufacturers 
want to build products that can be sold 
anywhere in the United States. 
However, there are parts of the United 
States where the incoming water is 
colder than the water specified by the 
test procedure, and this may cause pre- 
condensing. AHRI asserted that 
efficiency levels at these levels create 
safety issues, and that manufacturers 
would have to rely on manufacturing 
and installation skills due to the small 
margin between condensing and non- 
condensing operation. (AHRI, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 110– 
111) 
DOE acknowledges that for efficiency 
levels associated with near-condensing 
operation, a portion of the flue products 
may condense, and this percentage may 
vary as a function of field conditions. 
Additionally, operation where a portion 
of the flue gases condense (i.e., near- 
condensing operation) creates the same 
safety issues associated with fully 
condensing operation because corrosive 
condensate is introduced into the heat 
exchanger and venting system during 
both types of operation. Therefore, DOE 
determined that for instantaneous gas- 
fired water heater efficiency levels 5 and 
6 (energy factors 0.84 and 0.85, 
respectively), the costs associated with 
condensing operation should be 
accounted for in the MPCs. DOE revised 
its costs for the NOPR phase of this 
analysis for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters to account for design 
changes necessary to handle condensate 
at these efficiency levels. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
The baseline efficiencies for DHE are 
defined by the current Federal 
minimum energy conservation 
standards and the representative 
characteristics for products on the 
market that just meet Federal minimum 
energy conservation standards, as 
measured by the AFUE, and effective on 
January 1, 1990. (10 CFR part 430.32(i)) 
For DHE, the AFUEs corresponding to 
the representative input ratings in 10 
CFR 430.32(i) were assigned as the 
baseline unit AFUEs. 
Table IV.16 through Table IV.20 show 
the efficiency levels DOE analyzed for 
each product class of DHE, along with 
technologies that manufacturers could 
use to reach that efficiency level. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
identified various efficiency levels for 
gas wall fan DHE, including max-tech 
levels that used electronic ignition and 
induced draft combustion systems. DOE 
did not receive any comments 
pertaining to its efficiency levels or 
technologies for the preliminary 
analysis. After reviewing the efficiency 
levels and technologies for the NOPR 
analysis, DOE determined that the same 
efficiency levels and technologies are 
still appropriate. 
TABLE IV.16—GAS WALL FAN-TYPE DHE, OVER 42,000 BTU/H 
Efficiency level (AFUE) Technology 
Baseline (AFUE = 74) .............................................................................. Standing Pilot. 
Efficiency Level 1 (AFUE = 75) ................................................................ Intermittent Ignition and Two-Speed Blower. 
Efficiency Level 2 (AFUE = 76) ................................................................ Intermittent Ignition and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
Efficiency Level 3 (AFUE = 77) ................................................................ Intermittent Ignition, Two-Speed Blower, and Improved Heat Ex-
changer. 
Efficiency Level 4¥Max-Tech (AFUE = 80) ............................................ Induced Draft and Electronic Ignition. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
identified gas wall gravity efficiency 
levels and technology options, which 
included a 75-percent AFUE level as the 
max-tech that could be achieved using 
induced draft. DOE received several 
comments in response. 
AHRI cautioned that adding too many 
electrical devices to gas wall gravity- 
type DHE will at some point remove 
those products from that product class, 
because they will get converted into gas 
wall fan-type DHE. (AHRI, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 69– 
70) AHRI also stated that an external 
electrical supply is required at some of 
the higher efficiency levels. AHRI 
asserted that when this occurs, that 
product can no longer be classified as a 
gravity-type product, but instead would 
be a fan-type product. Therefore, AHRI 
stated that the efficiency levels 
presented in the preliminary analysis 
are unrealistic for gas wall gravity-type 
DHE. (AHRI, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 34.4 at pp. 114–115) Additionally, 
Bock commented that adding induced 
draft technology to a gas wall gravity- 
type unit would exclude it from this 
equipment class. (Bock, Public Meeting 
Transcript No. 34.4 at p. 119) 
In response to these comments, DOE 
further reviewed the gravity-type wall 
DHE market and the available products 
and technologies for the NOPR analyses. 
A ‘‘vented wall furnace’’ (i.e., gas wall 
fan-type or gravity-type DHE) is defined 
as a vented heater that furnishes heat air 
circulated either by gravity or by a fan. 
10 CFR 430.2. Gravity-type and fan-type 
wall DHE are differentiated only by the 
inclusion (fan-type) or exclusion 
(gravity-type) of a fan from the design. 
DOE agrees with Bock that the addition 
of an induced draft fan (which forces 
the combustion products through the 
heat exchanger to increase turbulence 
and, thus, heat transfer) would cause 
those products to be excluded from the 
wall gravity product class. Thus, for the 
NOPR analysis, DOE removed the

efficiency level at 75 AFUE that 
corresponded to induced draft 
technology. Instead, DOE identified 72 
AFUE as the max-tech efficiency level, 
which can be attained using electronic 
ignition technology. 
TABLE IV.17—GAS WALL GRAVITY-TYPE DHE, OVER 27,000 BTU/H AND UP TO 46,000 BTU/H 
Efficiency level (AFUE) Technology 
Baseline (AFUE = 64) .............................................................................. Standing Pilot. 
Efficiency Level 1 (AFUE = 66) ................................................................ Standing Pilot and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
Efficiency Level 2 (AFUE = 68) ................................................................ Standing Pilot and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
Efficiency Level 3 (AFUE = 71) ................................................................ Standing Pilot and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
Efficiency Level 4¥Max Tech (AFUE = 72) ............................................ Electronic Ignition. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
analyzed several efficiency levels for gas 
floor DHE, ranging from 57 AFUE up to 
75 AFUE. DOE chose these levels based 
on the product availability listings 
contained in manufacturer specification 
sheets and DOE’s previous analysis for 
direct heating equipment. However, for 
the NOPR, DOE conducted another 
review of the current market and 
determined that the market no longer 
offers models above 58 percent AFUE. 
This assessment was based on a review 
of updated information from AHRI 
Directory of Certified Products and 
manufacturer specification sheets. In its 
review, DOE identified heat exchanger 
improvements as a potential design 
approach to achieve the max-tech level 
58 AFUE. DOE could not find any 
prototypes being developed above 58 
percent AFUE. Accordingly, DOE based 
the efficiency levels for the NOPR 
analyses on those levels known to be 
technologically feasible for this product 
class and DOE only analyzed the 
baseline and max-tech efficiency levels, 
because no products are available at any 
other efficiency levels (See Table 
IV.18.). 
TABLE IV.18—GAS FLOOR-TYPE DHE, OVER 37,000 BTU/H 
Efficiency level (AFUE) Technology 
Baseline (AFUE = 57) .............................................................................. Standing Pilot. 
Efficiency Level 1¥Max Tech (AFUE = 58) ............................................ Standing Pilot and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
included gas hearth DHE in the analysis 
for gas room DHE. For the NOPR 
analysis, DOE is establishing a separate 
product class for gas hearth DHE. 
Consequently, DOE revised the 
efficiency levels analyzed for gas room 
DHE to represent the market and 
technologies available for products, 
excluding those that are now gas hearth 
DHE, based upon the characteristics of 
the fireplace and DOE’s proposed 
definition for ‘‘gas hearth DHE.’’ This 
resulted in the elimination of several 
efficiency levels that were considered in 
the preliminary analysis for gas room 
DHE. Also, the max-tech efficiency level 
has changed for the NOPR because of 
this restructuring of the DHE product 
classes. For room heaters, the use of 
electronic ignition and multiple heat 
exchangers has been identified as a 
possible approach to reach the max-tech 
efficiency level (AFUE = 83). These 
technologies are being used in room 
heaters that are currently on the market.

Efficiency Level 4 (AFUE = 68) ................................................................ Standing Pilot and Improved Heat Exchanger. 
Efficiency Level 5¥Max Tech (AFUE = 83) ............................................ Electronic Ignition and Multiple Heat Exchanger Design. 
DOE did not analyze a gas hearth DHE 
product class separately in the 
preliminary analysis. Based upon public 
comment, for the NOPR analysis, DOE 
surveyed the residential gas hearth DHE 
market to identify technologies and 
efficiency levels common to gas hearth 
DHE. For gas hearth DHE, DOE 
identified products capable of 
condensing operations and rated at 93 
AFUE as the max-tech level.

c. Pool Heaters 
The baseline efficiencies for pool 
heaters were defined by the current 
Federal minimum energy conservation 
standards and the representative 
characteristics for products on the 
market that just meet Federal minimum 
energy conservation standards, as 
measured by thermal efficiency and 
effective on January 1, 1990. (10 CFR 
430.32(k)) For pool heaters, the thermal 
efficiency corresponding to the baseline 
unit is 78 percent. Id. 
DOE analyzed efficiency levels for 
pool heaters with standing pilot 
ignitions and pool heaters with 
electronic ignitions for the preliminary 
analysis. DOE distinguished between 
the two ignition systems because of the 
energy use difference between 
electronic ignition and standing pilot 
systems. The DOE test procedure does 
not fully include the energy use by a 
standing pilot systems in the thermal 
efficiency metric, but DOE accounted 
for the energy use difference between 
electronic ignition and standing pilot 
systems in its consumer LCC analysis. 
DOE did not receive any comments in 
response to the preliminary analysis 
that opposed this approach, and, 
therefore, DOE continues to use it for 
the NOPR analysis. After surveying the 
pool heater market, DOE determined 
that electronic ignition is offered in 
products covering the whole range of 
efficiencies, while standing pilot 
ignition systems are only offered in 
products corresponding to the first three 
intermediate efficiency levels. 
Consequently, DOE developed two 
baseline products and two efficiency 
pathways for efficiency levels 1 through 
3. 
For the NOPR analysis, DOE 
examined the same efficiency levels as 
it did in the preliminary analysis (see 
Table IV.21). 
TABLE IV.21—GAS-FIRED POOL HEATER, 250,000 BTU/H 
Efficiency level (thermal efficiency) Technology 
Baseline (Thermal Efficiency = 78) * ........................................................
Efficiency Level 1 (Thermal Efficiency = 79) * .......................................... Improved Heat Exchanger Design.

Efficiency Level 8¥Max Tech (Thermal Efficiency = 95) ........................ Sealed Combustion, Condensing, Improved Heat Exchanger Design. 
* Technologies incorporating either a standing pilot or electronic ignition. Efficiency Levels above 3 include electronic ignition. 
In the executive summary to the 
preliminary TSD, DOE sought 
comments on design changes 
manufacturers might use to mitigate the 
formation of corrosive condensation at 
86 percent thermal efficiency for gas- 
fired pool heaters. DOE also sought 
comments on the changes 
manufacturers would make to the 
product design and the effects on MPC 
that would result if the amended energy 
conservation standards were at 86 
percent thermal efficiency. 
Raypak commented that Efficiency 
Level 6 (i.e., 86 percent) requires sealed 
combustion, which will be a condensing 
system. (Raypak, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 120–121) 
AHRI urged DOE to exclude near- 
condensing thermal efficiency levels 
from its analysis. AHRI pointed out that 
manufacturers would need to address a 
range of field installations and operating 
conditions if a minimum energy 
conservation standard level is set in the 
near-condensing range. (AHRI No. 43 at 
p. 5) 
In response, DOE is aware of a pool 
heater model on the market at Efficiency 
Level 6. According to product literature, 
these models do not appear to 
incorporate condensate management. 
Therefore, DOE did not change the 
technology options at Efficiency Level 6 
to represent a condensing pool heater. 
However, DOE’s technology option for 
Efficiency Level 6 does include sealed 
combustion, as Raypak suggested. 
4. Cost Assessment Methodology 
At the start of the preliminary 
engineering analysis, DOE identified the 
energy efficiency levels associated with 
residential heating products on the 
market, as determined in the market 
assessment. DOE also identified the 
technologies and features that are 
typically incorporated into products at 
the baseline level and at the various 
energy efficiency levels above the 
baseline. Next, DOE selected products 
for the physical teardown analysis that 
corresponded to the representative rated 
storage volumes and input capacities. 
DOE gathered the information from the 
physical teardown analysis to create 
bills of materials using a reverse 
engineering methodology. After that, 
DOE used the physical teardown 
analysis to identify the design pathways 
manufacturers typically use to increase 
the EF of residential water heaters, the 
AFUE of residential DHE, or the thermal 
efficiency of residential pool heaters. 
DOE calculated the MPC for products 
spanning the full range of efficiencies 
from the baseline to the maximum 
technology available at various levels, 
and it also identified each technology or 
combination of technologies in each 
product that was responsible for 
improving the energy efficiency. DOE 
determined the cost-effectiveness of 
each technology by comparing the 
increase in MPC to the increase in 
energy efficiency. For the NOPR, DOE 
reexamined and revised several of the 
steps in its cost assessment 
methodology based on additional 
teardown analysis and in response to 
comments received on the preliminary 
analysis. 
During the preparation and refining of 
the cost-efficiency comparison and 
MPCs for the NOPR, DOE also held 
interviews with manufacturers to gain 
insight into each of the water heating, 
direct heating, and pool heating 
industries and requested comments on 
the engineering approach DOE used. 
DOE used the information gathered from 
these interviews, along with the 
information gathered through additional 
teardown analysis and public 
comments, to refine efficiency levels 
and assumptions in the cost model. 
Next, DOE converted the MPCs into 
MSPs using publicly-available water 
heating, direct heating, and pool heating 
industry financial data, in addition to 
manufacturers’ feedback. Further 
information on comments received and 
the revisions to the analysis 
methodology is presented in subsections 
a through g of this section. For

additional detail, see chapter 5 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
a. Teardown Analysis 
To assemble bill of materials (BOMs) 
and to calculate the manufacturing costs 
of the different components in 
residential heating products, DOE 
disassembled multiple residential 
heating products into their base 
components and estimated the 
materials, processes, and labor required 
for the manufacture of each individual 
component, a process referred to as a 
‘‘physical teardown.’’ Using the data 
gathered from the physical teardowns, 
DOE characterized each component 
according to its weight, dimensions, 
material, quantity, and the 
manufacturing processes used to 
fabricate and assemble it. DOE also used 
a supplementary method, called a 
‘‘virtual teardown,’’ which uses 
published manufacturer catalogs and 
supplementary component data to 
estimate the major physical differences 
between a product that was physically 
disassembled and a similar product that 
was not. For supplementary virtual 
teardowns, DOE gathered product data 
such as dimensions, weight, and design 
features from publicly-available 
information, such as manufacturer 
catalogs. DOE obtained information and 
data not typically found in catalogs and 
brochures, such as fan motor details, gas 
manifold specifications, or assembly 
details, from the physical teardowns of 
a similar product or through estimates 
based on industry knowledge. The 
teardown analysis for this engineering 
analysis included over 40 physical and 
virtual teardowns of water heaters, DHE, 
and pool heaters during the preliminary 
analysis and over 20 additional 
teardowns performed for the NOPR 
analysis. The additional teardowns 
performed for the NOPR analysis 
allowed DOE to further refine the 
product components and assumptions 
used to develop the MPCs. 
The teardown analysis allowed DOE 
to identify the technologies that 
manufacturers typically incorporate into 
residential heating products, along with 
the efficiency levels associated with 
each technology or combination of 
technologies. DOE used the teardown 
analysis to create detailed BOMs for 
each product class. The BOMs from the 
teardown analysis were then placed into 
the cost model to calculate the MPC for 
the representative product in each 
product class. See chapter 5 of the 
NOPR TSD for more details on the 
teardown analysis. 
b. Cost Model 
The end result of each teardown is a 
structured BOMs. DOE developed 
structured BOMs for each of the 
physical and virtual teardowns. The 
BOMs incorporate all materials, 
components, and fasteners classified as 
either raw materials or purchased parts 
and assemblies, and characterize the 
materials and components by weight, 
manufacturing processes used, 
dimensions, material, and quantity. The 
cost model is a Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet that converts the materials 
and components in the BOMs into 
dollar values based on the price of 
materials, labor rates associated with 
manufacturing and assembling, and the 
cost of overhead and depreciation. To 
convert the information in the BOMs to 
dollar values for the preliminary 
analysis, DOE collected information on 
labor rates, tooling costs, raw material 
prices, and other factors. For purchased 
parts, the cost model estimates the 
purchase price based on volume- 
variable price quotations and detailed 
discussions with manufacturers and 
component suppliers. For fabricated 
parts, the prices of raw metal materials 
(e.g., tube, sheet metal) are estimated on 
the basis of 5-year averages. The cost of 
transforming the intermediate materials 
into finished parts is estimated based on 
current industry pricing. For the NOPR 
analysis, DOE updated all of the labor 
rates, tooling costs, raw material prices, 
the costs of resins, and the purchased 
parts costs. Chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD 
describes DOE’s cost model and 
definitions, assumptions, and estimates. 
DOE received several comments on 
the material prices collected for use in 
the cost model, as discussed below. 
Bock commented that manufacturer 
production costs were calculated 
approximately 2 years before the public 
meeting for the preliminary analysis. 
Bock noted that the price of steel has 
increased tremendously and that DOE 
should recalculate these costs. (Bock, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at 
p. 27) In written comments, Bock 
reiterated that because material prices, 
particularly for steel, have increased 
significantly since DOE completed its 
analysis, DOE’s estimated manufacturer 
production costs and selling prices 
should be adjusted to reflect this trend. 
(Bock, No. 53 at p. 1) 
In contrast, ACEEE commented that 
DOE significantly overestimated the cost 
of compliance with amended standards 
to the consumer. ACEEE stated that this 
was due to the effects of changing 
material prices on products and 
suggested that it would be appropriate 
for DOE to review past rulemakings to 
determine the accuracy of DOE’s 
analytical approaches. (ACEEE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 81– 
82) Southern Company disagreed with 
ACEEE regarding the cost to the 
consumer and referenced the most 
recent residential air conditioner 
rulemaking which was done when 
commodity prices were depressed. 
Southern stated that because of the 
depressed commodity prices, the actual 
costs were higher than DOE’s 
projections. (Southern, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 82) Further, 
Southern commented that a 5-year 
rolling average of commodity prices 
would be appropriate for this 
rulemaking. (Southern, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 83) Rheem 
agreed with Southern regarding 
commodity prices. Regarding the 
residential central air conditioner 
rulemaking, Rheem stated that the 
results were devastating to the industry 
and domestic manufacturers, and the 
company urged DOE to be very careful 
in estimating the cost to consumers 
because of the potential for a 
significantly adverse impact on 
domestic manufacturing jobs. (Rheem, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at 
pp. 83–84) In its written comments, 
Rheem noted that manufacturer 
production costs were derived from 
material prices that were based on 5- 
year averages from 2003 to 2007. Rheem 
urged DOE to revise material prices due 
to their drastic increases and volatility 
driven by global demand. (Rheem, No. 
49 at pp. 2–3) A.O. Smith agreed that 
using material prices from 2003 through 
2007 to determine a normalized average 
may be understating actual prices, 
which continued to fluctuate but 
generally increased in 2008. (A.O. 
Smith, No. 37 at p. 4) 
Because all interested parties agreed 
with DOE’s approach to use 5-year 
rolling average material prices in the 
engineering analysis, DOE used the 
same approach in the NOPR analysis. 
DOE acknowledges Bock’s, Rheem’s, 
and A.O. Smith’s concerns about the 
timing of the production cost 
calculations because the majority of 
manufacturer production cost can 
typically be attributed to materials, 
which can fluctuate greatly from year to 
year. DOE uses a 5-year span to 
normalize the fluctuating prices 
experienced in the metal commodities 
markets to screen out temporary dips or 
spikes. DOE believes a 5-year span is the 
longest span that would still provide 
appropriate weighting to current prices 
experienced in the market. DOE updates 
the 5-year span for metal prices based 
on a review of updated commodity

pricing data, which point to continued 
increases. Considering the significant 
amount of steel and copper in the 
different heating products at issue in 
this rulemaking, incorporating 
commodity prices that reflect 5-year 
average prices as close to current 
conditions would best reflect overall 
market conditions. Consequently, DOE 
calculated a new 5-year average 
materials price using the U.S. 
Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Indices 
(PPIs) for various raw metal materials 
from 2005 to 2009 to calculate new 
averages, which incorporate the changes 
within each material industry and 
inflation. DOE also used BLS PPI data 
to update current market pricing for 
other input materials such as plastic 
resins and purchased parts. Finally, 
DOE adjusted all averages to 2008$ 
using the gross domestic product 
implicit price deflator. 
c. Manufacturing Production Cost 
Once the cost estimate for each 
teardown unit was finalized, DOE 
totaled the cost of materials, labor, and 
direct overhead used to manufacture a 
product in order to calculate the 
manufacturer production cost for the 
preliminary analysis. The total cost of 
the product was broken down into two 
main costs: (1) The full manufacturer 
production cost or MPC; and (2) the 
non-production cost, which includes 
selling, general, and administration 
(SG&A) costs, the cost of research and 
development, and interest. DOE 
estimates the MPC at each efficiency 
level considered for each product class, 
from the baseline through the max-tech. 
After DOE incorporates all of the 
assumptions into the cost model, DOE 
calculates the different percentages of 
each aspect of production cost (i.e. 
materials, labor, depreciation, and 
overhead) that make up the total 
production cost. The product cost 
percentages are used to validate the 
assumptions by comparing them to 
manufacturers’ actual financial data 
published in annual reports, along with 
feedback from manufacturers during 
interviews. DOE uses these production 
cost percentages in the MIA (see section 
IV.H). 
For the NOPR analysis, DOE revised 
the assumptions in the cost model based 
on additional teardown analysis, 
updated pricing, and additional 
manufacturer feedback, which resulted 
in revised MPCs and production cost 
percentages. DOE calculated the average 
product cost percentages by product 
type (i.e., water heater, DHE, pool 
heater) as well as by product class (e.g., 
gas-fired storage water heater, electric 
storage water heater) due to the large 
variations in production volumes, 
fabrication and assembly costs, and 
other assumptions that affect the 
calculation of the unit’s total MPC. 
Chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD shows 
DOE’s estimate of the MPCs for the 
NOPR phase of this rulemaking, along 
with the different percentages for each 
aspect of the production costs that make 
up the total product MPC. 
DOE received various comments in 
response to the MPCs presented in its 
preliminary analysis, as discussed 
below. 
For pool heaters, Raypak stated that 
the cost difference between the ignition 
systems of gas-fired pool heaters should 
be more than $3, because the electronic 
ignition controls cost more than $3. 
Raypak also commented that the 
materials used for Efficiency Level 6 
must be suitable for condensing 
applications, which means that DOE’s 
estimate for MPC for Efficiency Level 6 
is understated. (Raypak, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 120–121) 
In response, DOE revised all of the 
MPCs for residential heating products 
for the NOPR analyses. In the case of 
pool heaters, DOE reexamined the 
component cost assumptions for 
electronic ignitions and revised the 
estimate of the cost to implement an 
electronic ignition design. The revised 
cost assumptions for an electronic 
ignition are documented in chapter 5 of 
the NOPR TSD. DOE also revised the 
costs for Efficiency Level 6, but did not 
consider the costs associated with 
condensate management at that 
efficiency level. Some residential pool 
heater designs currently on the market 
do not appear to accommodate 
condensing operations at 86 percent 
thermal efficiency, thereby suggesting 
that such costs need not be incurred to 
reach that efficiency level. Therefore, 
DOE did not account for condensate 
management in the cost of products at 
Efficiency Level 6. 
Regarding gas-fired storage water 
heaters, Rheem stated that the MPC and 
MSP for Efficiency Level 6 should be 
higher. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 4) A.O. 
Smith asserted that the estimated 
manufacturer production costs in DOE’s 
preliminary analysis are too low for 
max-tech water heaters (i.e., heat pump 
water heaters and condensing gas-fired 
water heaters). (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 
4) Additionally, A.O. Smith stated that 
the baseline MPCs are approximately 11 
percent low for gas-fired storage water 
heaters and 13 percent low for electric 
storage water heaters. (A.O. Smith, No. 
37 at p. 6) 
On this point, DOE has revised its 
cost estimates for storage water heaters 
at all levels, including the baseline and 
the max-tech efficiency levels based on 
manufacturer feedback obtained during 
interviews performed for the MIA (see 
section IV.H.4). The resulting cost 
estimates for the NOPR analysis are 
higher than in the preliminary analysis. 
Chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD discusses 
DOE’s cost estimates for max-tech 
storage water heaters. 
BWC commented that the energy 
factor for condensing gas-fired storage 
water heaters (the max-tech level) was 
based on models on the market that are 
not classified as residential water 
heaters. BWC stated that it is unfair to 
use non-residential models to determine 
the cost of condensing water heaters, 
because non-residential models do not 
include components and the associated 
costs to make them compliant with 
other regulations, such as FVIR and 
ultra-low NOX requirements. (BWC, No. 
46 at p. 2). 
For DOE’s estimate of the 
manufacturing cost of condensing gas- 
fired storage water heaters, DOE did 
include the additional cost of FVIR in 
both the preliminary and NOPR 
analyses, which is not found in 
commercial water heaters currently on 
the market. DOE also based its 
condensing water heater design on one 
that would be more typical of 
residential applications (i.e., 40-gallon 
storage volume and 40,000 Btu/h input 
capacity). In addition, DOE developed 
separate manufacturer production costs 
for gas-fired storage water heaters with 
standard burners and for gas-fired 
storage water heaters with ultra-low 
NOX burners (section IV.C.2), including 
those gas-fired water heaters that would 
have been at the max-tech efficiency 
level. 
d. Cost-Efficiency Curves 
The result of the engineering analysis 
is a set of cost-efficiency curves. DOE 
created 11 curves representing each 
product class examined for this NOPR. 
For storage water heaters, the cost- 
efficiency curves show the 
representative rated storage volumes in 
addition to the other storage volumes 
analyzed. 
Chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD contains 
the 11 cost-efficiency curves in the form 
of energy efficiency (i.e., EF, AFUE, or 
thermal efficiency) versus MPC. The 
results show that the cost-efficiency 
curves are nonlinear. As efficiency 
increases, manufacturing becomes more 
difficult and more costly. Large jumps 
are evident when efficiencies approach 
levels where electronic ignition, blower 
motors, power vent, and condensing 
operation are included in designs. 
Additionally, MPC increases greatly

when heat pump technology is used as 
an alternative to resistive heating for 
electric storage water heaters. 
The non-linear relationship is 
common across all product types. In 
addition, DHE and high-efficiency pool 
heaters see larger increases in MPC due 
to lower production volumes than water 
heaters. 
In response to the cost-efficiency 
curves developed for the preliminary 
analysis, ACEEE asserted that DOE’s 
cost-efficiency relationship ignores the 
potential ‘‘learning-by-doing’’ effects 
that have driven down the costs of 
technologies for almost all regulated 
goods. The commenter argued that more 
stringent standards lead to product 
redesigns that almost inevitably result 
in lower consumer prices for more- 
efficient goods after the amended 
standards have become effective. ACEEE 
recommended that DOE balance the 
current cost-efficiency development 
approach with the historical results of 
rulemakings on manufacturer 
production costs. (ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 
5) 
Similarly, NRDC questioned DOE 
predictions that more-efficient products 
result in escalating costs and stated that 
DOE should re-analyze these 
projections. NRDC also commented that 
this rulemaking addresses products 
previously covered and analyzed in 
other rulemakings, and asserted that 
DOE should evaluate previous analyses 
by reviewing its predictions versus the 
realized effects of standards so that costs 
are not overestimated for this 
rulemaking. NRDC stated that an 
overestimation of the cost to improve 
efficiency could cause DOE to set 
standards below the levels that would 
be justified if DOE were to determine 
costs by more accurate methods, a result 
which would fail to meet the 
requirements of the statute. (NRDC, No. 
48 at p. 4) 
DOE does not agree with ACEEE or 
NRDC for the following reasons. DOE 
recognizes that every change in 
minimum energy conservation 
standards is an opportunity for 
manufacturers to make investments 
beyond what would be required to meet 
the new standards in order to minimize 
costs or to respond to other factors. 
However, DOE’s manufacturing cost 
estimates seek to gauge the most likely 
industry response to meet the 
requirements of proposed energy 
conservation standards. DOE’s analysis 
of manufacturing cost must be based on 
currently-available technology that 
would provide a nonproprietary 
pathway for compliance with a standard 
once it becomes effective, and, thus, 
DOE cannot speculate on future product 
and market innovation. In response to a 
change in energy conservation 
standards, manufacturers have made a 
number of changes to reduce costs in 
the past. For example, DOE understands 
manufacturers have re-engineered 
products to reduce cost, made changes 
to manufacturing process to reduce 
labor costs, and moved production to 
lower-cost areas to reduce labor costs. 
However, these are individual company 
decisions, and it is impossible for DOE 
to forecast such decisions. DOE does not 
know of any data that would allow it to 
determine the precise course a 
manufacturer may take. Furthermore, 
while manufacturers have been able to 
reduce the cost of products that meet 
previous energy conservation standards, 
there are no data to suggest that any 
further reductions in cost are possible. 
Therefore, it would not be appropriate 
to speculate about cost reduction based 
upon prior actions of manufacturers of 
either the same or other products. 
Setting energy conservation standards 
upon relevant data is particularly 
important given EPCA’s anti-backsliding 
provision at 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(1). 
e. Manufacturer Markup 
DOE applies a non-production cost 
multiplier (the manufacturer markup) to 
the full MPC to account for corporate 
non-production costs and profit. The 
resulting manufacturer selling price is 
the price at which the manufacturer can 
recover all production and non- 
production costs and earn a profit. To 
meet new or amended energy 
conservation standards, manufacturers 
often introduce design changes to their 
product lines that result in increased 
manufacturer production costs. 
Depending on the competitive 
environment for these particular 
products, some or all of the increased 
production costs may be passed from 
manufacturers to retailers and 
eventually to customers in the form of 
higher purchase prices. As production 
costs increase, manufacturers typically 
incur additional overhead. The MSP 
should be high enough to recover the 
full cost of the product (i.e., full 
production and non-production costs), 
and yield a profit. The manufacturer 
markup has an important bearing on 
profitability. A high markup under a 
standards scenario suggests 
manufacturers can pass through the 
increased variable costs and some of the 
capital and product conversion costs 
(the one-time expenditures). A low 
markup suggests that manufacturers will 
not be able to recover as much of the 
necessary investment in plant and 
equipment. 
To calculate the manufacturer 
markups for the preliminary analysis, 
DOE used 10–K reports from publicly- 
owned residential heating products 
companies. (SEC 10–K reports can be 
found using the search database at: 
http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/ 
webusers.htm.) The financial figures 
necessary for calculating the 
manufacturer markup are net sales, 
costs of sales, and gross profit. For the 
preliminary analysis, DOE averaged the 
financial figures spanning 2000 to 2006 
and then calculated the markups. For 
the NOPR analysis, DOE updated the 
financial figures using 10–K reports 
spanning 2003 to 2008. To calculate the 
time-average gross profit margin for 
each firm, DOE summed the gross profit 
for all the years and then divided the 
result by the sum of the net sales for 
those years. DOE presented the 
calculated markups to manufacturers 
during the interviews for the NOPR (see 
section IV.H.4). DOE considered the 
feedback from manufacturers in order to 
supplement the calculated markup, and 
refined the markup to better reflect the 
residential heating products market. 
DOE developed the manufacturer 
markup by weighting the feedback from 
manufacturers on a market share basis, 
since manufacturers with larger market 
shares more accurately represent a 
greater portion of the market. DOE used 
a constant markup to reflect the MSPs 
of the baseline products as well as more- 
efficient products. DOE took this 
approach because amended standards 
may make high-efficiency products, 
which currently are considered 
premium products, and make them the 
baselines. See chapter 5 of the NOPR 
TSD for more details about the markup 
calculation. 
In response to the preliminary 
analysis, Bock commented on the MPC 
and MSP for oil-fired storage water 
heaters at Efficiency Level 6. Bock 
stated that the MPC is reasonable in 
terms of considering increased material 
costs, but that the MSP is much too low 
(implying that DOE’s markup for oil- 
fired storage water heaters is too low). 
The commenter stated that the 
distribution chain is flawed for some 
manufacturers and that, unlike gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters, oil- 
fired storage water heaters require an oil 
burner that adds approximately $400 to 
the MSP. Based upon the above 
reasoning, Bock stated that the MSP for 
Efficiency Level 6 is approximately 
$1,400. (Bock, No. 53 at p. 1) 
The MSP, as defined by DOE, is the 
selling price from the manufacturer to 
the first step in its distribution chain 
(e.g., a wholesaler, a distributor, or a 
national retailer). The MSP does not

include any further markups for the rest 
of the distribution chain, but the MPC 
for oil-fired storage water heaters 
includes the price of the burner. 
Therefore, the MSP as defined by DOE 
can be significantly lower than the 
purchase price for an end-consumer, 
which is what DOE believes Bock is 
referring to. The purchase price would 
depend on the typical markups in each 
step of the distribution chain as well as 
the number of layers of distribution the 
product has to clear before reaching the 
end-consumer. Section IV.D of this 
notice describes the distribution chain 
markups in further detail. 
f. Shipping Costs 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
accounted for the shipping costs for 
residential heating products as part of 
the non-production costs that comprise 
the manufacturer markup. This 
approach is typical of energy 
conservation standards rulemakings for 
residential products. 
Following the preliminary analysis, 
DOE received several comments about 
the impact of an amended energy 
conservation standard on shipping (i.e., 
freight) costs for storage water heaters. 
A.O. Smith commented that freight is 
not a manufacturing cost, but it is a 
substantial cost incurred for water 
heaters, especially tank-type models. 
Water heater manufacturers generally 
pay for shipping to most customers; 
therefore, this cost is added in the 
manufacturer’s gross margin calculation. 
A.O. Smith noted that an increase in 
water heater size will add cost to the 
overall manufacture/purchase 
transition. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 4) 
Similarly, BWC commented that DOE 
underestimated the increase in freight 
costs as overall dimensions increase 
when larger cavity sizes are used. (BWC, 
No. 46 at p. 2). 
Although the non-production costs 
typically account for freight in the 
manufacturer markup, DOE responded 
to these comments by separating the 
shipping costs from the markup 
multiplier for storage water heaters for 
the NOPR analysis in order to make the 
MSP calculation more transparent. DOE 
calculated the MSP for storage water 
heaters by multiplying the MPC 
determined from the cost model by the 
manufacturer markup and adding 
shipping costs. More specifically, DOE 
calculated shipping costs based on a 
typical 53-foot straight frame trailer 
with a storage volume of 4,240 cubic 
feet. DOE examined the average sizes of 
representative water heaters and 
determined the number of units that 
would fit in each trailer, based on 
assumptions about the arrangement of 
water heaters in the trailer. Finally, DOE 
calculated the average cost for each unit 
shipped based on an average cost of 
$4,000 per trailer load. See chapter 5 of 
the NOPR TSD for more details about 
DOE’s shipping cost assumptions and 
the shipping costs per unit for each 
storage water heater product class. 
g. Manufacturer Interviews 
Throughout the rulemaking process, 
DOE seeks feedback and insight from 
interested parties to improve the 
information used in its analyses. DOE 
interviewed manufacturers as a part of 
the NOPR manufacturer impact analysis 
(see section IV.H.4). During the 
interviews, DOE sought feedback on all 
aspects of its analyses for residential 
heating products. For the engineering 
analysis, DOE discussed the analytical 
assumptions and estimates, cost model, 
and cost-efficiency curves with 
manufacturers of water heaters, DHE, 
and pool heaters. DOE considered all 
the information manufacturers provided 
when refining the cost model and 
assumptions. DOE incorporated 
equipment and manufacturing process 
figures into the analysis as averages to 
avoid disclosing sensitive information 
about individual manufacturers’ 
products or manufacturing processes. 
More details about the manufacturer 
interviews are contained in chapter 12 
of the NOPR TSD. The interview guides 
DOE distributed to manufacturers are 
contained in appendix 12–A of the 
NOPR TSD. 
5. Results 
The results from the engineering 
analysis were used in the LCC analysis 
to determine consumer prices for 
residential heating products at the 
various potential standard levels. Using 
the manufacturer markup, DOE 
calculated the MSPs of the 
representative water heaters, DHE, and 
pool heater from the MPCs developed 
using the cost model. Chapter 5 of the 
NOPR TSD provides the full list of 
MPCs and MSPs at each efficiency level 
for each analyzed representative 
product. 
6. Scaling to Additional Rated Storage 
Capacities for Water Heaters 
To account for the large variation in 
the rated storage volumes of residential 
storage water heaters and differences in 
both usage patterns and first cost to 
consumers of water heaters larger or 
smaller than the representative capacity, 
DOE scaled its MPCs and efficiency 
levels at the representative capacities to 
several discrete rated storage volumes at 
capacities higher and lower than the 
representative storage volume for each 
storage water heater product class. DOE 
developed the MPCs for water heaters at 
each of the rated storage volumes shown 
in Table IV.22. These storage volumes 
were determined to be the most 
prevalent storage volumes available on 
the market during the market analysis 
(see Chapter 3 of the TSD). The MPCs 
developed for this analysis were used in 
the downstream LCC analysis, where a 
distribution of MPCs was used based on 
the estimated market share of each rated 
storage volume (see Section IV.E).

Oil-fired Storage ..................................................................................................................................................................... 50. 
To develop the MPCs for the analysis 
of additional storage volumes, DOE 
developed a cost model based on 
teardowns of representative units from a 
range of nominal capacities and 
multiple manufacturers. Whenever 
possible, DOE maintained the same 
product line that was used for the 
teardown at the representative storage 
volume to allow for a direct comparison 
between models at the representative 
storage volume and models at higher 
and lower storage volumes. The cost 
model accounts for changes in the size 
of water heater components that would 
scale with tank volume (e.g., tank 
dimensions, wrapper dimensions, wall 
thicknesses, insulation thickness, anode

rod(s), flue pipe(s)). Components that 
typically do not change based on tank 
volume (e.g., gas valves, thermostats, 
controls) were assumed to remain 
largely the same across the different 
storage volume sizes, while accounting 
for price differences due to changes in 
insulation thickness. DOE estimated the 
changes in material and labor costs that 
occur at volume sizes higher and lower 
than the representative capacity based 
on observations made during teardowns 
and professional experience. Performing 
teardowns of models outside of the 
representative capacity allowed DOE to 
accurately model certain characteristics 
(such as tank wall thickness and 
wrapper thickness) that are not 
identifiable in manufacturer literature. 
While DOE was able to receive 
feedback from manufacturers regarding 
the manufacturing costs of storage water 
heaters at representative storage 
capacities, DOE was unable to solicit 
manufacturing cost feedback from 
manufacturers regarding the additional 
water heaters shown above. However, 
DOE was able to finely tune the 
performance of the cost model to 
accurately predict the weights of non- 
representative units via the additional 
teardowns. For example, DOE observed 
that the tank wall thickness increases as 
a function of tank diameter. Based on 
the feedback received from 
manufacturers for representative units 
and the accuracy of the material 
predictions for non-representative units, 
DOE believes that its scaling is accurate. 
In addition to comparing model output 
to actual teardowns, model outputs 
were also compared to published 
catalog data. 
The results of DOE’s analysis for the 
additional storage volumes are 
presented in chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD 
(engineering analysis). Chapter 5 of the 
NOPR TSD also contains additional 
details about the calculation of MPCs for 
storage volumes outside of the 
representative capacity. DOE is seeking 
comment its MPC estimates at the 
additional storage volumes outside of 
the representative storage volumes, as 
well as on its approach to developing 
these MPCs. (See issue number 12 under 
Section VII.E ‘‘Issues on Which DOE 
Seeks Comment’’). 
7. Energy Efficiency Equations 
As part of the engineering analysis for 
residential water heaters, DOE reviewed 
the energy efficiency equations that 
define the existing Federal energy 
conservation standards for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters. The 
energy efficiency equations allow DOE 
to expand the analysis on the 
representative rated storage volume to 
the full range of storage volumes 
covered under the existing Federal 
energy conservation standards. 
DOE uses energy efficiency equations 
to characterize the relationship between 
rated storage volume and energy factor. 
The energy efficiency equations allow 
DOE to account for the increases in 
standby losses as tank volume increases. 
As the tank storage volume increases, 
the tank surface area increases. The 
larger surface area results in higher heat 
transfer rates that result in higher jacket 
losses. Other losses to consider are the 
feed-through losses and flue losses (for 
gas-fired water heaters). The current 
energy efficiency equations show that 
for each water heater class, the 
minimum energy factor decreases as the 
rated storage volume increases. 
After reviewing market data and 
product literature for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters, DOE 
presented two approaches for amending 
the existing energy efficiency equations 
for storage water heaters. One approach 
was to maintain the same slope used in 
the existing equations, but to 
incrementally increase the intercepts. 
This created energy efficiency equations 
with the same slope to define EF across 
the entire range of storage volumes for 
each efficiency level. The advantage of 
this approach would be to maintain the 
same slopes established in NAECA and 
used in the 2001 rulemaking, which 
have historically characterized the water 
heater market. 
A second approach was to adjust the 
slope of the energy efficiency equations 
based on the review of the storage water 
heater models currently on the market. 
The advantage of this approach is the 
acknowledge the changes in the product 
efficiencies offered over time and 
account for these changes. DOE 
examined the efficiencies of models 
with varying storage volumes, but with 
the same or similar design features. DOE 
varied the slope of the line to maximize 
the number of models in the series that 
meet the efficiency levels DOE is 
considering in the full range of rated 
storage volumes. DOE sought comments 
on approaches to develop the energy 
efficiency equations for all storage 
volumes and all efficiency levels of gas- 
fired and electric storage water heaters. 
Specifically, DOE sought comment on 
an alternative approach based on model 
series that incorporate current market 
data from AHRI’s Consumers’ Directory 
to generate revised equation slopes that 
minimize the number of models that 
would become obsolete. DOE received 
feedback from several interested parties, 
as discussed immediately below. 
ACEEE commented that the 
alternative energy efficiency equations 
appear to relax the energy factor 
requirements for smaller capacity water 
heaters while making the energy factor 
requirements more stringent for larger 
capacity water heaters. (ACEEE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 100) 
AHRI stated that there are more options 
for saving energy at higher capacities. 
AHRI further stated that additional 
energy may be saved by using an 
alternative energy efficiency equation 
and that there may be two equations 
that define the energy conservation 
standard across the range of rated 
volumes. (AHRI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 101–102) 
Rheem argued that size constraints must 
be considered when determining 
alternative energy efficiency equations 
and efficiency levels for replacement 
water heaters. Rheem stated that there 
are certain doorways and attics where 
installations will not be possible due to 
size constraints. (Rheem, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 104) 
Rheem expressed concern that 
changes to the energy efficiency 
equations may result in the elimination 
of certain capacities. However, Rheem 
stated that the current slope is 
inappropriate as it would set 
unattainable levels for small and large 
capacity water heaters. Rheem 
commented that the proposed 
alternative equations disproportionately 
affect gas-fired storage water heaters, 
especially large-storage-volume 
products. In sum, Rheem recommended 
that DOE should revisit the current 
equations to determine whether energy 
factors across the full range of rated 
storage volumes are still appropriate. 
(Rheem, No. 49 at p. 6) 
EEI expressed support for DOE’s 
decision to update the energy efficiency 
equations for storage-type water heaters. 
However, EEI cautioned DOE to avoid 
eliminating certain storage volumes 
from the market. Therefore, EEI 
suggested that DOE develop a two-slope 
approach for smaller and larger water 
heaters to ensure competition in the 
marketplace. (EEI, No. 40 at p. 4) 
In response, DOE agrees that the 
alternative slopes examined at each 
efficiency level for the preliminary 
analysis were not as stringent for the 
lower storage volume models and were 
more stringent for higher storage volume 
models when compared to the slope 
defining existing standards. DOE 
presented such slopes because many 
models at lower storage volumes have 
already reached close to the maximum 
possible efficiency with conventional 
technologies, while there is more 
potential for increased energy efficiency 
for models with larger storage volumes. 
However, DOE also notes that this

increased stringency may discourage 
manufacturers from continuing to 
develop larger storage volume models. 
To attempt to mitigate these issues, DOE 
is proposing ‘‘two-slope’’ energy 
efficiency equations to better define the 
relationship between storage volume 
and energy factor across the range of 
covered storage volumes. 
ACEEE stated its support for 
modifying the energy efficiency 
equations for electric and gas-fired 
storage water heaters if the effect would 
be to increase the EF for larger units 
(i.e., those units with a higher rated 
storage volume). For electric storage 
water heaters, ACEEE supported 
capping the EF requirement at 0.95, 
even for the smaller rated storage types. 
(ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 6) NEEA and NPCC 
agreed with DOE’s intention to adjust 
the slopes of the energy efficiency 
equations for gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters. Specifically, 
NEEA and NPCC stated their support for 
the recommended approach by fitting 
the energy efficiency equations to actual 
product lines on the market. NEEA and 
NPCC recommended a further lessening 
of the slope than the examples shown in 
the preliminary analysis to preserve at 
least one model offered on the current 
market over the range of storage 
volumes. (NEEA and NPCC, No. 42 at 
p. 6) BWC commented that the energy 
efficiency equations for water heaters 
should be changed, arguing that as 
amended standards increase energy 
efficiency, it becomes increasingly 
difficult for units with larger gallon 
capacities to comply. (BWC, No. 46 at 
p. 1) 
In contrast, A.O. Smith stated that the 
existing energy efficiency equations 
should not be changed. While A.O. 
Smith acknowledged some of the points 
DOE made in the preliminary analyses 
regarding the existing energy efficiency 
equations, A.O. Smith stated it would 
take a much more detailed investigation 
than DOE has used to validate the 
points raised. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at 
p. 8) 
While DOE acknowledges that A.O. 
Smith does not support changing the 
energy-efficiency equations for gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters, DOE 
believes that the slopes of the energy 
efficiency equations can be revised to 
more accurately characterize the 
relationship between storage volume 
and energy factor for the current storage 
water heater market. 
For this NOPR, DOE reviewed AHRI’s 
March 2009 Consumers’ Directory and 
developed a database of products that 
includes all gas-fired and electric 
storage water heater models subject to 
this rulemaking. DOE also reviewed 
manufacturers’ catalogs to gather 
information on the design 
characteristics of each water heater 
model. The manufacturers’ catalogs 
include information on efficiency 
ratings, product series descriptions, 
jacket insulation thicknesses, ignition 
types, and drafting methods (i.e., natural 
or power vented drafting). To further 
investigate the relationship between EF 
and rated storage volume, DOE 
conducted testing according to the water 
heater test procedure specified in 10 
CFR 430, subpart B, appendix E (the 
same test procedure manufacturers use 
to certify products in AHRI’s 
Consumers’ Directory) to verify the EF 
values. DOE tested model series with 
similar design characteristics and 
volumetric designs to isolate how EF 
changes with rated storage volume. DOE 
performed this testing for a number of 
model series at various efficiencies and 
for a variety of manufacturers. DOE 
chose models to test by selecting 
product series from multiple major 
manufacturers that span the range of 
rated volumes within each product class 
and that span the range of efficiency 
levels. After completion of testing, DOE 
conducted a teardown analysis of the 
tested models and confirmed the 
specific technologies that affect energy 
efficiency and the volumetric 
characteristics of the tank. DOE used the 
results of this analysis to adjust the 
energy efficiency equations. 
Using the information gathered from 
product catalogs, independent testing 
results, and product teardowns, DOE 
developed an alternative approach for 
revising the energy efficiency equations 
based on three constraints. DOE applied 
the following constraining criteria to the 
development process: 
• For gas-fired water heaters, each 
energy efficiency equation must include 
units with the specified efficiency level 
at 40-gallon rated storage volume. 
• For electric storage water heaters, 
each energy efficiency equation must 
include units with the specified 
efficiency level at 50-gallon rated 
storage volume. 
• The energy efficiency equations 
cannot result in a standard that falls 
below current standards over the entire 
rated volume range. 
DOE chose this approach because it 
takes into account the models currently 
on the market, considers the 
technologies incorporated into those 
models, and attempts to optimize the 
number of models across the entire 
rated volume range that would meet the 
efficiency levels DOE is considering. 
The approach also attempts to minimize 
the number of models that would be 
eliminated from the market by the 
efficiency levels DOE is considering 
across the entire range of storage 
volumes. 
In examining the market data to 
develop the energy efficiency equations, 
DOE noted a trend of greater decline in 
energy efficiency at higher rated storage 
volumes than at lower storage volumes. 
As a result, DOE developed energy 
efficiency equations with varying slopes 
at several of the efficiency levels 
analyzed for the NOPR analysis. These 
equations maintain one slope from the 
minimum covered rated storage volume 
up to a certain rated storage volume (i.e., 
60 gallons for gas-fired storage water 
heaters and 80 gallons for electric 
storage water heaters), and then 
maintain a different slope over the 
remaining range of covered storage 
volumes. DOE selected 60-gallon and 
80-gallon storage volumes as the point 
where the change in slope of the energy 
efficiency equations for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters, 
respectively, should occur, because the 
market data suggested a natural break in 
the available products at those points. 
Models with gallon sizes above 60 
gallons for gas-fired units and 80 gallons 
for electric units typically experienced 
reduced efficiencies more rapidly as a 
function of increasing storage volume, 
as compared to units with lower volume 
sizes. The higher ends of the residential 
storage capacities also have a lower 
volume of shipments. 
Based upon the above approach, for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, DOE did 
not change the slope of the energy 
efficiency equation for storage volumes 
above 60 gallons across efficiency levels 
(i.e., DOE kept the same slope above 60 
gallons at each efficiency level). Few 
gas-fired storage water heaters exist with 
storage volumes greater than 60 gallons, 
and, therefore, the market data were 
very limited. Due to the lack of data for 
the efficiency at larger gas-fired water 
heater storage volumes, DOE used the 
slope defining the current standard for 
residential gas-fired storage water 
heaters, as listed in DOE’s regulations at 
10 CFR 430.32(d). In other words, DOE 
maintained the same slope for 
Efficiency Level 1 through Efficiency 
Level 5 for gas-fired storage water 
heaters above 60 gallons. 
For the max-tech efficiency levels 
considered for gas-fired storage water 
heaters and electric storage water 
heaters, DOE also did not change the 
slope of the energy efficiency equations. 
Because there are no products currently 
available on the market meeting the 
max-tech efficiency levels, DOE could 
not perform an analysis or come to any 
definitive conclusion about the effect of 
storage volume on energy factor at these 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 20:45 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\11DEP2.SGM 11DEP2jle

efficiency levels. However, DOE does 
recognize that with any storage water 
heater, the standby losses will increase 
with storage volume due to increased 
tank surface area. Because there is no 
data that DOE can use to make a 
determination of an appropriate slope at 
these levels, DOE maintained the 
relationship between storage volume 
and energy factor developed previously 
for water heaters. Therefore, the energy 
efficiency equations for the max-tech 
levels exhibit the same slopes used for 
the gas-fired storage water heater and 
electric storage water heaters in the 
current energy conservation standards at 
10 CFR 430.32(d). Table IV.23 and Table 
IV.24 show the energy efficiency 
equations developed for the NOPR for 
gas-fired and electric storage water 
heaters, respectively.

DOE seeks comment on the energy 
efficiency equations for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters developed 
for the NOPR. In particular, DOE seeks 
comment on its approach to developing 
the energy efficiency equations, the 
appropriate slope of energy efficiency 
equations at each efficiency level 
analyzed, and the appropriate storage 
volumes for changing the slope of the 
line. DOE is also interested in 
alternatives to the energy efficiency 
equations that DOE should consider for 
the final rule. (See Issue 7 under ‘‘Issues 
on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ in 
section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
There are very few models of oil-fired 
storage water heaters on the market. The 
lack of data to correlate storage volume 
and energy factor for oil-fired water 
heaters makes it difficult for DOE to 
conclude that an alternative approach is 
needed for the energy efficiency 
equations. In the preliminary analysis, 
DOE presented energy efficiency 
equations for oil-fired storage water 
heaters that were developed by 
maintaining the same slope used in the 
existing Federal requirements found in 
10 CFR 430.32(d). DOE did not present 
any alternative method to establishing 
energy efficiency equations for oil-fired 
storage water heaters. 
In response, AHRI stated its support 
for using the current energy efficiency 
equations for oil-fired storage water 
heaters. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 5) 
Because DOE did not receive any 
comments in opposition to using the 
same slopes for oil-fired storage water 
heaters that currently define the existing 
Federal standards, DOE is continuing to 
use the same methodology for the 
NOPR. 
AHRI also recommended that DOE 
remove the volume adjustment term 
from the energy efficiency equations for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
and specify a minimum EF applicable to 
all sizes of residential instantaneous 
water heaters. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 5) 
Additionally, A.O. Smith stated that 
because gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters have no volume correction, an 
EF level for all sizes would be 
appropriate. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 7) 
DOE acknowledges that nearly all are 
rated at 0 gallons of storage volume. 
Because the volume adjustment term is 
multiplied by storage volume, this will 
by default eliminate the volume 
adjustment term from the energy 
efficiency equation used for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters with a rated 
storage volume of 0 gallons. However, 
by definition, gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters may have a rated storage 
volume of up to 2 gallons. Therefore, 
DOE is proposing to maintain the 
volume adjustment factor for 
consistency with the other energy- 
efficiency equations. 
See chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD for 
additional information about the energy 
efficiency equations for residential 
water heaters. 
D. Markups To Determine Product Price 
By applying markups to the 
manufacturer selling prices estimated in 
the engineering analysis, DOE estimated 
the amounts consumers would pay for 
baseline and more-efficient products. At 
each step in the distribution channel, 
companies mark up the price of the 
product to cover business costs and 
profit margin. The appropriate markups 
for determining the consumer product 
price depend, therefore, on the type of 
distribution channels through which 
products move from manufacturer to 
consumer. 
Bock stated that DOE needs to 
consider that manufacturers sell to their 
representatives, who sell water heaters 
to distributors. (Bock, No. 53 at p. 2) 
DOE’s information indicates that 
manufacturer representatives work on 
commission to facilitate sales from 
manufacturers to both distributors and 
retailers, but they do not mark up the 
products. The commission is part of the 
manufacturers’ costs. 
The distribution channel for water 
heaters differs for replacement versus 
new applications, resulting in different

markups. For replacement applications, 
manufacturers sell to either plumbing 
distributors or large retail outlets 
(typically large home-supply stores). 
Products destined for replacement 
applications follow one of two paths: (1) 
A retail outlet sells a unit to the 
consumer, who either installs it or hires 
someone to install it; or (2) a plumbing 
distributor sells a unit to a contractor, 
who then sells it to a consumer and 
installs it. Bock suggested modifying the 
first distribution channel to include a 
contractor-installer. (Bock, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 140– 
141) DOE agrees that a contractor- 
installer may be involved in the first 
path, but because the consumer 
purchases the product directly, the 
contractor does not mark up the cost of 
the unit. Thus, DOE did not include a 
contractor-installer in the first 
distribution path. 
AHRI disagreed with the analytical 
results that indicate higher markups for 
new construction than for replacement 
applications. (AHRI, No. 33 at p. 1) 
DOE’s markup for new construction is 
higher because it includes a markup for 
builders. Because builders incur the cost 
of a water heater or direct heating 
equipment installed in a new home, 
DOE finds it appropriate to include a 
markup for this cost. To estimate a 
builder markup, DOE calculated an 
average markup that applies to all costs 
builders incur (based on Census data). 
NEEA and NPCC stated that DOE 
should repeat the process used to 
determine markups for the 2001 water 
heater rulemaking so that costs 
including markups align with the 
marketplace. They also stated that 
DOE’s method for validating calculated 
markups is insufficient, although further 
explanation was not provided. (NEEA 
and NPCC, No. 42 at pp. 6–7) 
The 2001 water heater rulemaking 
used data on retail prices to estimate 
markups. DOE did not use the same 
markup process as in the current 
rulemaking, however, because 
commenters on the previous rulemaking 
stated that DOE provided no 
consistency checks to determine the 
method’s validity, and it did not 
account for the differences in price 
associated with different technologies. 
In addition, DOE has adopted a different 
approach to estimate markups in all of 
its rulemakings conducted in recent 
years that DOE believes is appropriate 
because it provides consistent estimates 
based on publicly-available statistics. 
DOE collected retail price data for water 
heaters to provide a check on its 
estimated markups. DOE’s average 
calculated retail price for water heaters 
is close to the average Internet retail 
price for typical electric and oil-fired 
storage water heaters, 7 percent lower 
for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, and 11 percent lower for gas- 
fired storage water heaters. Given the 
uncertainty regarding the 
representativeness of the retail price 
data that DOE collected, DOE considers 
that its markup method provides 
reasonably good agreement with prices 
in the market. 
E. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
Analyses 
DOE conducted LCC and PBP 
analyses to evaluate the economic 
impacts on individual conducted LCC 
and PBP analyses to evaluate the 
economic impacts on individual 
consumers of potential amended energy 
conservation standards for the three 
types of residential heating products. 
The LCC represents total consumer 
expenses during the life of an appliance, 
including purchase and installation 
costs plus operating costs (expenses for 
energy use, maintenance, and repair). 
To compute LCCs for the three heating 
products, DOE discounted future 
operating costs to the time of purchase, 
then summed those costs over the life of 
the appliances. The PBP is calculated 
using the change in purchase cost 
(normally higher) that results from an 
amended efficiency standard, divided 
by the change in annual operating cost 
(normally lower) that results from the 
standard. 
DOE measures the changes in LCC 
and PBP associated with a given 
efficiency level relative to an estimate of 
base-case appliance efficiencies. The 
base-case estimate reflects the market in 
the absence of amended mandatory 
energy conservation standards, 
including the market for products that 
exceed the current standards. 
For each set of heating products, DOE 
calculated the LCC and PBP for a 
nationally representative set of housing 
units, which were selected from EIA’s 
Residential Energy Consumption Survey 
(RECS). The preliminary analysis used 
the 2001 RECS. The analysis for today’s 
proposed rule uses the 2005 RECS. (See 
http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/recs/.) For 
each sampled household, DOE 
determined the energy consumption and 
energy price for the heating product. By 
developing a representative sample of 
households, the analysis captured the 
variability in energy consumption and 
energy prices associated with the use of 
residential heating products. DOE 
determined the LCCs and PBPs for each 
sampled household using a heating 
product’s unique energy consumption 
and the household’s energy price, as 
well as other variables. DOE calculated 
the LCC associated with the baseline 
heating product in each household. To 
calculate the LCC savings and PBP 
associated with equipment that meets 
higher efficiency standards, DOE’s 
analysis replaced the baseline unit with 
a range of more-efficient designs. 
EEI stated that not all residential 
water heaters are installed in homes, 
and thus DOE should modify its 
analysis to account for product usage 
and energy pricing in commercial 
establishments. (EEI, No. 40 at p. 5) DOE 
is unaware of data that show the 
percentage of residential water heater 
shipments that go to the commercial 
sector or how those products are used 
in the commercial sector, and the 
commenter did not provide such data. 
Therefore, DOE did not undertake a 
separate analysis for such installations. 
Inputs to the calculation of total 
installed cost include the cost of the 
product—which includes manufacturer 
costs, manufacturer markups, retailer or 
distributor markups, and sales taxes— 
and installation costs. Inputs to the 
calculation of operating expenses 
include annual energy consumption, 
energy prices and price projections, 
repair and maintenance costs, product 
lifetimes, discount rates, and the year 
that proposed standards take effect. DOE 
created distributions of values for some 
inputs to account for their uncertainty 
and variability. Probabilities are 
attached to each value. As described 
above, DOE used samples of households 
to characterize the variability in energy 
consumption and energy prices for 
heating products. For the inputs to 
installed cost, DOE used probability 
distributions to characterize sales taxes. 
DOE also used distributions to 
characterize the discount rate and 
product lifetime that are inputs to 
operating cost. 
The computer model DOE uses to 
calculate LCC and PBP, which 
incorporates Crystal Ball (a 
commercially available software 
program), relies on a Monte Carlo 
simulation to incorporate uncertainty 
and variability into the analysis. The 
Monte Carlo simulations randomly 
sampled input values from the 
probability distributions and household 
samples. The model calculated the LCC 
and PBP for products at each efficiency 
level for 10,000 housing units per 
simulation run. 
Table IV.25 summarizes the approach 
and data DOE used to derive inputs to 
the LCC and PBP calculations. The table 
provides the data and approach DOE 
used for the preliminary TSD, as well as 
the changes made for today’s NOPR.

** Survey of Consumer Finances. 
1. Product Cost 
To calculate consumer product costs, 
DOE multiplied the manufacturer 
selling prices developed in the 
engineering analysis by the supply- 
chain markups described above (along 
with sales taxes). DOE used different 
markups for baseline products and 
higher-efficiency products, because the 
markups estimated for incremental costs 
differ from those estimated for baseline 
models. 
2. Installation Cost 
The installation cost is the total cost 
to the consumer to install the 
equipment, excluding the marked-up 
consumer product price. Installation 
costs include labor, overhead, and any 
miscellaneous materials and parts. 
a. Water Heaters 
In its preliminary analysis, DOE 
included several installation costs that 
reflect the space constraints on water 
heaters having thicker insulation. DOE 
assumed that major modifications for 
replacement installations would occur 
40 percent of the time for water heaters 
with 3 inches or greater insulation. The 
analysis included costs for 
modifications such as removing door 
jams or incorporated strategies such as 
installing a smaller tank plus a 
tempering valve. To estimate the 
fraction of households that would 
require various modifications, DOE used 
the water heater location determined for

each sample household. DOE 
determined the location using 
information from the 2005 RECS, which 
reports whether the house has a 
basement, whether the basement is 
heated or unheated, and the presence or 
absence of a garage, crawlspace, or attic. 
DOE received several comments on 
the space constraints for water heaters 
with increased insulation thicknesses. 
AHRI stated that the analysis does not 
fully recognize the size constraints on 
water heaters that have increased 
insulation. (AHRI, No. 33 at p. 2) For 
example, AHRI questioned DOE’s 
assumption that space constraints do 
not apply if the floor area of a house is 
more than 1,000 square feet. (AHRI, No. 
43 at p. 4) Rheem and AHRI stated that 
DOE should consider the space 
constraints of water heaters installed in 
attics. (Rheem, No. 49 at p. 2; AHRI, No. 
43 at p. 4) Rheem stated that space 
constraints render larger products 
economically and technically infeasible. 
(Rheem, No. 49 at p. 1) EEI stated that 
DOE should consider the effect of 
adding insulation to electric storage 
water heaters and the issue of space 
constraints in replacement situations. 
(EEI, No. 40 at p. 4) PG&E, San Diego 
Gas and Electric (SDG&E), and SoCal 
Gas stated that if the diameter of a water 
heater is increased by 2 inches, 
installation becomes unworkable in 
highly constrained spaces. (PG&E, 
SDG&E, and SoCal Gas, No. 38 at p. 3) 
A.O. Smith stated that many closets 
and cabinets do not have adequate 
clearance to accommodate larger- 
diameter water heaters. It stated that 
many electric storage water heaters 
cannot accept larger-diameter tanks 
without modifying the installation. A.O. 
Smith added that in the South, many 
water heater installations are in attics, 
and larger water heaters may not fit 
between the two ceiling joists in the 
pull-down staircase to the attic. A.O. 
Smith suggested that DOE’s analysis 
should increase the number of 
installations that would require 
modification or the use of a small water 
heater with a tempering valve. (A.O. 
Smith, No. 37 at pp. 1–2) 
In response to the above comments, 
for the NOPR analysis, DOE further 
investigated the issue of space 
constraints for water heaters with 
insulation thickness of 2 inches and 
above. Based upon the results of this 
inquiry, DOE expanded the percentage 
of installations that may have space 
constraints, including houses having a 
floor area of more than 1,000 square 
feet. For approximately 20 percent of 
replacement installations, DOE applied 
major modifications (removal of door 
jamb at an average cost of $191) for 
water heater designs with 2-inch 
insulation. For another 20 percent of 
replacement installations, DOE assumed 
that the household would install a 
smaller water heater and use tempering 
and check valves (at an average cost of 
$142). DOE also added a cost for extra 
labor needed to install water heaters in 
attics, and for installing larger water 
heaters (66 gallon and larger). 
AHRI stated that the additional cost of 
$22 for tempering and check valves 
associated with installing an electric 
water heater is significantly 
understated. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 4) In 
clarification, DOE incorporated an 
average cost of $142 for tempering and 
check valves for homes where they 
would be needed. The value of $22 is 
an average over all homes, including 
those where tempering and check valves 
are not necessary. 
AHRI stated that a survey conducted 
by the SEGWHAI project in California 
determined that the average installation 
cost for a standard gas-fired storage 
water heater approached $1,000, which 
is higher than DOE’s estimated average. 
(AHRI, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at pp. 84–85) DOE used RS Means 
and installation cost data to derive a 
nationally-representative range of 
installation costs, whereas the 
SEGWHAI data pertain only to 
California. Because of the need to set a 
national standard, DOE has continued to 
rely on RS Means as a recognized and 
commonly used source for estimating 
such costs. 
AHRI also stated that DOE 
underestimated the cost of condensing 
gas-fired storage water heaters. AHRI 
said that SEGWHAI estimated an 
installed cost of $4,000, compared to 
DOE’s estimate of $1,782. The 
SEGWHAI estimate refers to a large- 
capacity commercial condensing unit 
having an EF of 0.84. For a condensing 
gas-fired storage water heater having an 
EF of 0.82 (a more appropriate 
comparison for the residential units at 
issue here), SEGWHAI proposes a 
$1,700 Tier 2 cost, which is comparable 
to the estimated installed cost of the 
0.77 EF unit considered in DOE’s 
analysis. 
NEEA and NPCC questioned why 
DOE included the cost of installing an 
electrical outlet in the cost of gas-fired 
storage water heaters. (NEEA and NPCC, 
No. 42 at p. 8) In response, DOE 
understands that the baseline gas-fired 
water heater requires no electricity. If 
such a model is replaced with a higher- 
efficiency unit, however, an electrical 
outlet installation may be required. 
The American Gas Association (AGA) 
stated that the installation costs for gas- 
fired storage water heaters having an EF 
greater than 0.62 need to include the 
cost of stainless steel vent connectors. 
(AGA, No. 44 at p. 3) DOE agrees that 
some models having an EF greater than 
0.62 will require stainless steel vent 
connectors, but only if the recovery 
efficiency (RE) is 78 percent or higher. 
For the NOPR analysis, DOE added the 
cost of stainless steel vent connectors 
for all natural draft gas-fired water 
heaters that have an RE of 78 percent or 
higher. 
A.O. Smith stated that the installation 
costs for electric storage water heaters at 
all efficiency levels are overstated by a 
factor of two. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 
6) In response, DOE acknowledges that 
the average installation costs for electric 
storage water heaters presented in the 
preliminary TSD were too high. 
Consequently, for the NOPR analysis, 
DOE updated the labor cost. Instead of 
using national-average costs, DOE used 
region-specific costs, which yield a 
lower national-average cost for electric 
water heaters. DOE also reduced the 
labor time by one half hour. The result 
is that the average installation cost for 
electric storage water heaters is 
approximately half as much as the cost 
estimated in the preliminary analysis. 
AGA stated that DOE’s cost estimate 
for providing electrical supply to water 
heaters that incorporate electronic 
ignition is too low. AGA stated that DOE 
should use the cost estimates in other 
rulemakings for installations where 
electrical service is needed. (AGA, No. 
44 at pp. 3–4) DOE’s estimated cost for 
adding electrical supply for water 
heaters requiring electronic ignition, 
which is based on RS Means, is similar 
to the costs DOE used in the rulemaking 
for cooking products (74 FR 16040 
(April 8, 2009)) and other rulemakings 
for installations that require electrical 
service. 
Rheem stated that the cost of 
installing gas-fired, electric storage, and 
low-boy electric water heaters in 
manufactured housing units, where 
water heaters are typically installed 
under a counter, would be affected at 
higher efficiency levels. (Rheem, No. 49 
at p. 2) As discussed previously, DOE 
considered and accounted for the cost of 
accommodating space constraints that 
may arise in some replacement 
applications when higher-efficiency 
units with thicker insulation are 
installed. In the specific case of 
manufactured homes, for the NOPR 
DOE increased the fraction of 
installations assumed to have space 
constraints by two-fold. 
Table IV.26 shows the average 
installation costs used in the NOPR 
analysis for selected efficiency levels 
considered for gas-fired and electric

storage water heaters. (Installation costs 
for electric storage water heaters with 
heat pump design are further discussed 
below.) The costs vary with the location 
of the water heater. For electric 
resistance water heaters, the average 
installation costs at different efficiency 
levels are similar for basement and 
garage locations, but they are higher for 
water heaters of 0.95 EF for indoor and 
attic locations. For gas-fired water 
heaters, the average installation cost is 
much higher for 0.67 EF and 0.80 EF 
units because thereis a change from 
metal Category I vents to plastic 
Category IV vents.

DOE received several comments on 
installation costs for heat pump water 
heaters. In its preliminary analysis, DOE 
applied a distribution of costs for heat 
pump water heater installations in 
enclosed spaces, including situations 
where modifications would be required. 
In its comments on the preliminary 
analysis, GE stated that in general, heat 
pump water heaters should be no more 
difficult or expensive to install than 
standard electric storage water heaters, 
because they will require the same 
electrical and plumbing connections. GE 
noted that its heat pump water heater 
occupies a footprint similar to that of a 
standard unit. GE stated, however, that 
it may be difficult to install a heat pump 
water heater in a confined space that 
lacks ventilation. (GE, No. 51 at p. 2) 
A.O. Smith commented that the 
requirements for providing adequate air 
flow for a heat pump water heater may 
be higher than DOE estimated. (A.O. 
Smith, No. 37 at p. 1) NEEA and NPCC 
stated that DOE should use a 
distribution of costs to encompass heat 
pump water heater installations that 
require building modifications. (NEEA 
and NPCC, No. 42 at p. 8) 
DOE agrees that installation of heat 
pump water heaters in enclosed spaces 
may require modifications to allow for 
adequate ventilation. Accordingly, for 
half of indoor replacement installations, 
DOE added a cost for installing a fully- 
louvered closet door to permit adequate 
air flow for the operation of the unit. It 
used a distribution of costs that averages 
$344. In addition, DOE assumed that the 
household facing space constraints 
would install a smaller water heater and 
use tempering and check valves in 20 
percent of replacement installations. 
DOE’s preliminary analysis 
considered the fact that heat pump 
water heaters draw heat from the space 
in which they are located and release 
cooled air. Thus, when such a water 
heater is located in a conditioned space, 
its use affects the load that the home’s 
space heating and air conditioning 
equipment must meet. DOE accounted 
for the additional energy costs that 
affected households would incur. 
Southern commented that DOE had 
not adequately considered the issues 
Southern previously raised regarding 
installing heat pump water heaters to 
replace existing electric water heaters, 
which included the need to provide 
venting of cooled air released by such 
units. The commenter also stated that 
for new construction installations in 
multifamily housing units, interior 
locations are preferred for installing 
mechanical systems. Southern 
commented that a heat pump water 
heater could be installed indoors, but it 
would be costly to provide supply and 
return vents to the exterior. (Southern, 
No. 50 at pp. 2–3) 
In the NOPR analysis, DOE continued 
to assume that many households that 
would be affected by indoor operation 
of a heat pump water heater would not 
want to incur the cost of a venting 
system, and would instead operate their 
heating and cooling systems to 
compensate for the effects of the heat 
pump water heater. However, DOE 
agrees that some households would 
prefer to install a venting system. DOE 
estimated that those households that 
would experience significant indoor 
cooling due to operation of the heat 
pump water heater in the heating 
months (i.e., the heat pump cooling load 
is greater than 10 percent of the space 
heating load) would have a venting 
system installed to exhaust and supply 
air. Using calculations specific to each 
household in the subsample for electric 
water heaters, DOE estimated that 40 
percent of replacement installations 
would incur this cost, which averages 
$460. 
Table IV.27 shows the average 
additional installation costs that DOE 
applied for heat pump water heaters 
(relative to the baseline electric storage 
water heater), along with the fraction of 
installations receiving each specific 
cost.

In summary, for the NOPR analysis, 
DOE used a distribution of installation 
costs for heat pump water heaters 
ranging from $213 to $1,918. The 
estimated average installation cost for a 
heat pump water heater (at 2.00 EF), 
weighted over replacement and new 
construction applications, is $446. This 
compares to average costs of $222 for a 
baseline (0.9 EF) electric storage water 
heater and $282 for a 0.95 EF electric 
storage water heater. For further details 
on DOE’s derivation of installation costs 
for electric storage water heaters, please 
see chapter 8 of the NOPR TSD. DOE 
requests comments on its analysis of 
installation costs for water heaters; it is 
particularly interested in comments on 
its analysis of installation costs for heat 
pump water heaters. This is identified 
as issue 13 under ‘‘Issues on Which 
DOE Seeks Comment’’ in section VII.E 
of this NOPR. 
Regarding installation of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, A.O. Smith 
questioned whether DOE considered the 
need for the pressure relief valve and 
drain pans that manufacturers and 
codes require. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 
6) Noritz stated that gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters that achieve 
an EF of 0.83 or higher require 
condensate drains and some method of 
treating the condensate so that it can be 
disposed of, further adding to the 
installation cost. (Noritz, No. 36 at pp. 
1–2) For the NOPR analysis, DOE 
included the cost and installation of a 
drain pan and pressure relief valve, as 
well as a filter for treating the 
condensate for units with an EF of 0.83 
or higher. 
A.O. Smith questioned whether DOE 
included the cost to replace a gas line 
with a larger line when installing gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters in 
replacement applications. (In some 
cases the existing gas line is not 
adequate to accommodate the higher gas 
input required by the instantaneous 
water heaters.) A.O. Smith also stated 
that the analysis should include the 
costs related to extreme installation 
situations for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters, as DOE did for the costs 
of adding tempering valves or modifying 
door jams for electric storage water 
heaters. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 6) In 
response, DOE did not include the costs 
of such measures for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, because in 
those cases where these measures would 
be required, the extremely high cost 
would likely lead households to 
purchase a storage water heater instead. 
AHRI stated that DOE should 
reconcile its cost estimates for installing 
instantaneous water heaters with the 
SEGWHAI estimate, which is at least 
$200 to $300 more than DOE’s estimate. 
(AHRI, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at p. 168) As noted above, the 
SEGWHAI data pertain only to 
California, where labor costs are higher 
than the national average. For the 
NOPR, DOE used RS Means and 
installation cost data to derive region- 
specific installation costs. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
DOE used the approach in the 1993 
TSD to calculate installation costs for 
baseline direct heating equipment for its 
preliminary analysis, as it believes that 
the factors affecting DHE installation are 
largely unchanged, and more recent data 
are not available. For gas wall gravity, 
floor, and room direct heating 
equipment, DOE increased installation 
costs for designs that require electricity. 
DOE made this adjustment for the 
replacement market only, because 
wiring is considered part of the general 
electrical work in new construction. 
DOE did not receive comments on the 
installation costs for direct heating 
equipment, so it maintained the same 
approach for the NOPR analysis. For 
further details on DOE’s derivation of 
installation costs for direct heating 
equipment, please see chapter 8 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
c. Pool Heaters 
DOE developed installation cost data 
for the baseline pool heater in its 
preliminary analysis using RS Means 
and information in a consultant’s report. 
DOE incorporated additional 
installation costs for designs involving 
electronic ignition and/or condensing. 
DOE did not receive comments on the 
installation costs for pool heaters, so it 
maintained this earlier approach for the 
NOPR analysis. For further details on 
DOE’s derivation of installation costs for 
pool heaters, please see chapter 8 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
3. Annual Energy Consumption 
DOE determined the annual energy 
use in the field for the three types of 
heating products based on data obtained 
from RECS. DOE supplemented this 
data as required for each heating 
product, as discussed below. 
a. Water Heaters 
DOE calculated the annual energy 
consumption of water heaters in the 
sample households by considering the 
primary factors that determine energy 
use: (1) Hot water use per household; (2) 
energy efficiency of the water heater; 
and (3) operating conditions other than 
hot water draws. DOE used a hot water 
draw model to calculate hot water use 
for each household in the sample. The 
characteristics of each water heater’s 
energy efficiency were obtained from 
the engineering analysis. DOE 
developed water heater operating 
conditions (other than hot water draws) 
from weather data and other relevant 
sources. DOE used a simplified energy 
equation, the water heater analysis 
model (WHAM), to calculate the energy 
use of water heaters. WHAM accounts 
for a range of operating conditions and 
energy efficiency characteristics. DOE’s 
approach is explained in further detail 
in chapter 7 of the NOPR TSD. 
To estimate hot water use by each 
sample household, DOE used a hot 
water draw model that accounts for the 
key factors that determine such use, 
such as the number and ages of the 
people who live in the household, the 
way they consume hot water, the

presence of hot-water-using appliances, 
the tank size and thermostat set point of 
the water heater, and the climate in 
which the residence is situated. In 
general, households with higher hot 
water use have water heaters with larger 
storage volume. 
DOE received several comments on 
hot water use. ACEEE stated that the hot 
water draw model is insufficiently 
supported by field data. (ACEEE, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 178) 
NEEA and NPCC stated that DOE should 
provide more detail on the draw model 
and explain how it has been validated 
and calibrated. (NEEA and NPCC, No. 
42 at p. 7) DOE acknowledges that 
insufficient field data are currently 
available to fully validate the draw 
model. However, Electric Power 
Research Institute (EPRI) developed the 
draw model based on a nationally 
representative sample of households. It 
is DOE’s understanding that this widely- 
used model, which has been updated 
several times to account for changes in 
household hot water use, is the most 
credible tool available for modeling 
daily hot water use. The draw model is 
described in detail in appendix 7–B of 
this NOPR’s TSD, as well as in the 
reports referenced in chapter 7 of the 
TSD. 
NEEA and NPCC stated that current 
estimates of hot water use in the Pacific 
Northwest are about 20 percent higher 
than DOE’s estimate of national-average 
daily use. (NEEA and NPCC, No. 42 at 
p. 7) Household hot water use differs 
among geographic regions for various 
reasons. DOE’s analysis for Census 
Division 9 (which includes the Pacific 
Northwest) shows average hot water use 
by electric water heaters (47.9 gal/day) 
as being higher than the average 
national value (41.9 gal/day). Therefore, 
DOE believes that the estimates used in 
its analysis are reasonable. 
EEI stated that DOE should consider 
the effects on hot water use of smaller 
households and the lower hot water use 
of new dishwashers and clothes 
washers, which are installed in both 
new and existing homes. (EEI, No. 40 at 
p. 6) For the NOPR, DOE used the most 
recent data available regarding 
household characteristics (from the 
2005 RECS). In addition, DOE modified 
the hot water draw model to account for 
the impact of the efficiency standards 
that recently became effective for 
dishwashers and clothes washers. 
BWC commented that hot water usage 
for gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
may be different than for storage water 
heaters, although it has no evidence to 
support this idea. (BWC, No. 46 at p. 1) 
GE and Noritz stated that they are 
unaware of any data that support the 
assumption that consumers use more 
hot water with a gas-fired water heater. 
(GE, No. 51 at p. 3; Noritz, No. 36 at p. 
2) Because DOE found no usable data 
showing greater or lesser hot water use 
for instantaneous water heaters than for 
storage water heaters, it estimated that 
households use the same volume of hot 
water with both types of water heaters. 
Commenting on the calculation of 
energy use, Bock stated that WHAM 
does not accurately estimate energy 
consumption. (Bock, No. 53 at p. 2) In 
response, DOE notes that the WHAM 
equation has been validated against 
field data and that the comparison 
shows that WHAM results correlate 
well. 
NEEA and NPCC stated that the 
estimated energy use results could be 
verified with sub-metered (i.e., 
measured) field data. (NEEA and NPCC, 
No. 42 at p. 7) DOE found that the sub- 
metered field data for water heaters are 
insufficient to represent the range of 
national water heater energy use 
patterns. Therefore, DOE did not 
undertake such verification of its energy 
use estimates. 
AHRI and Bock stated that the 
estimates of annual energy consumption 
for gas- and oil-fired water heaters are 
about 65 percent of test procedure usage 
specifications, whereas for electric 
water heaters it is 55 percent. AHRI 
questioned why the analysis appears to 
be using different field use assumptions 
for electric water heaters. (AHRI, No. 33 
at p. 2; Bock, No. 53 at p. 2) In response, 
DOE’s analysis used 2005 RECS data to 
estimate the energy consumption of 
water heaters in use by U.S. households. 
DOE’s analysis thereby incorporates 
assumptions about operating conditions 
that are appropriate for each water 
heater type. For example, DOE 
determined that the average annual 
ambient temperature is higher for the 
stock of electric water heaters than for 
the stock of gas-fired water heaters. This 
difference contributes to the lower 
average energy use for electric water 
heaters. 
A.O. Smith stated that the analysis of 
ambient air temperature effects does not 
include water heaters installed in attics 
in the South, and that the temperature 
derivation formulas are not applicable 
to attic installations, where solar gain 
can bring temperatures to ambient plus 
40 °F in summer. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 
at pp. 5–6) DOE’s analysis included 
water heaters installed in attics and 
accounted for the range of temperatures 
found in such locations. 
The energy efficiency and 
consumption of heat pump water 
heaters depend on ambient temperature. 
The equation DOE used to determine 
the energy consumption of heat pump 
water heaters is similar to the WHAM 
equation, but it modulates the recovery 
efficiency by applying a performance 
adjustment factor that is a function of 
the average ambient temperature. GE 
stated that because lower ambient 
temperatures will affect the performance 
of both heat pump and storage water 
heaters, DOE should use universally 
applied conditions to compare products. 
(GE, No. 51 at p. 2) DOE’s energy 
calculations for heat pump and storage 
water heaters accounted for the effects 
of lower ambient temperatures. Heat 
pump water heaters are more affected by 
air temperature because the air provides 
the heat to warm the water. 
As stated previously, DOE assumed 
that many households that would be 
affected by indoor operation of a heat 
pump water heater would not want to 
incur the cost of a venting system, and 
would instead operate their space 
heating or cooling system to compensate 
for the effects of the heat pump water 
heater. For each such home, DOE 
estimated the impact on space heating 
only during heating months (i.e., when 
indoor temperature is at least 10 degrees 
greater than the average outdoor 
temperature), and the impact on air 
conditioning only during cooling 
months (i.e., when indoor temperature 
is at least 5 degrees less than the average 
outdoor temperature). For each affected 
household in the electric water heater 
sub-sample, DOE included such indirect 
energy use in its calculation of the 
energy consumption of a heat pump 
water heater. 
BWC stated that the assumed rated 
capacity (Pon) of 500 watts and cooling 
capacity of 3,500 Btu/h are not correct 
for all heat pump water heaters. (BWC, 
No. 46 at p. 2) For the preliminary 
analysis, DOE based those values on 
information available in AHRI’s 2007 
Consumers’ Directory. For the NOPR, 
DOE created a distribution of values for 
Pon and cooling capacity that represent 
a range of heat pump water heater 
designs. 
To calculate the energy use of gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters, DOE 
used the same approach as for storage 
water heaters, modified to account for 
the absence of a tank. For the 
preliminary analysis, DOE applied a 
performance adjustment factor to 
account for evidence that the rated 
energy efficiency of instantaneous water 
heaters overstates actual performance, 
as reported in a study of instantaneous 
water heater installations conducted for 
the California Energy Commission 
(CEC). See Davis Energy Group. Measure

2008standards/prerulemaking/ 
documents/2006–05–18_workshop/ 
2006–05–11_GAS_WATER.PDF. The 
adjustment factor effectively increases 
the calculated energy use of a gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater by 8.8 
percent. 
A.O. Smith noted its strong support 
for incorporating results from the CEC 
study to account for performance drop- 
off at small draw volumes. Because it 
requires 5 to 20 seconds for a gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater to heat up, 1 
gallon of cold water can be wasted at the 
beginning of every water draw. (A.O. 
Smith, No. 37 at pp. 1, 5) ACEEE, PG&E, 
SDG&E, SoCal Gas, and AGA also 
support applying a performance 
adjustment. (ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 7; 
PG&E, SDG&E, and SoCal Gas, No. 38 at 
p. 4; AGA, No. 44 at p. 3) BWC 
expressed support for applying the 8.8- 
percent adjustment factor to gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, noting that 
its testing indicates that this number 
may be a little low. (BWC, No. 46 at p. 
1) AHRI disagreed with applying an 8.8- 
percent factor. AHRI stated that the CEC 
study obtained its field data from one 
two-person household, which does not 
support a technically sound analysis. 
(AHRI, No. 33 at p. 2) Bock, GE, Noritz, 
and Rheem agreed. (Bock, No. 53 at p. 
2; GE, No. 51 at p. 3; Noritz, No. 36 at 
p. 2; Rheem, No. 49 at pp. 6–7) 
For the NOPR analysis, the 
performance adjustment factor DOE 
developed to capture the field energy 
use of gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters is a probability distribution. The 
factor changes based on household hot 
water consumption, rather than on a 
fixed value that may represent only a 
fraction of households. The 8.8-percent 
adjustment factor DOE used for the 
preliminary analysis became the upper 
value in the distribution DOE used for 
the NOPR. The rest of the range was 
derived from a Gas Technology Institute 
(GTI) study that calculated an energy 
use reduction (adjustment) factor as a 
function of the volume of water gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters use 
daily. 
Southern stated that the draws in the 
hot water draw model should ideally be 
shorter for instantaneous water heaters. 
(Southern, Public Meeting Transcript, 
No. 34.4 at p. 194) ACEEE stated that 
PG&E and Consumers Union have 
performed studies on alternative draw 
patterns for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters that are more reflective of 
daily use. (ACEEE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 195–196) In 
response, DOE’s performance 
adjustment factor accounts for a range of 
draw patterns associated with gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. 
Accordingly, DOE maintains its existing 
approach. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
For the preliminary analysis of LCC 
and PBP, DOE estimated energy 
consumption of direct heating 
equipment in functioning housing units. 
To represent actual households likely to 
purchase and use direct heating 
equipment, DOE developed a household 
sample from the 2001 RECS. DOE did 
not receive any comments on its 
approach for estimating energy 
consumption of direct heating 
equipment. Therefore, for the NOPR, 
DOE used the same approach, but it 
used a household sample drawn from 
the 2005 RECS. 
c. Pool Heaters 
For the preliminary analysis of LCC 
and PBP, DOE estimated energy 
consumption of pool heaters at 
functioning housing units. To represent 
actual households likely to purchase 
and use pool heaters, DOE used a 
household sample from the 2001 RECS. 
For the NOPR, DOE used a household 
sample drawn from the 2005 RECS. 
AHRI stated that DOE’s estimate of 
the annual energy use of a typical 
residential pool heater is overestimated 
by a factor of two. It said that DOE’s 
estimated annual energy use of 53.6 
MBtu [one thousand British thermal 
units] based on an energy use of 250 
kBtu/h at 78 percent thermal efficiency 
(a baseline unit) represents 214 hours of 
operation annually. AHRI mentioned a 
CEC study that determined that gas pool 
heaters were used on average 104 hours 
per year, and it commented that the LCC 
should be recalculated based on that 
value. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 5) 
In response, DOE notes that the CEC 
study mentioned is based on a single 
study conducted in the early 1990s. For 
the NOPR, DOE did revise the range of 
operating hours used its analysis, 
although it relied on more recent data 
than the referenced CEC study. Instead, 
DOE calculated the pool heater 
operating hours using the estimated 
pool heater heating load for each sample 
household from the 2005 RECS. The 
average hours of operation in the NOPR 
analysis is 149 per year, which results 
in an annual energy use of 38 MBtu for 
a 250 kBtu/hr baseline unit operating at 
78 percent thermal efficiency. 
d. Rebound Effect 
A rebound effect refers to increased 
energy consumption resulting from 
actions that increase energy efficiency 
and reduce consumer costs. For its 
preliminary analysis, DOE searched the 
literature on the rebound effect related 
to the three types of heating products, 
and also considered how EIA’s NEMS 
incorporates a rebound effect. 
For water heaters, DOE reviewed a 
summary of studies on the rebound 
effect, which concluded that ‘‘technical 
improvements for residential hot water 
heating will be between 60 and 90 
percent effective in reducing energy 
consumption for this service’’ (implying 
a rebound effect of 10 to 40 percent). 
See L.A. Greening, D.L. Greene, C. 
Difiglio, Energy Efficiency and 
Consumption: The Rebound Effect, 
Energy Policy, 28(6–7): pp. 389–401. 
DOE found that NEMS does not 
incorporate a rebound factor, however. 
Balancing these findings from the 
literature with the zero rebound effect 
used in NEMS, DOE decided that a 
rebound effect of 10 percent was 
reasonable for water heaters. 
A.O. Smith supported the use of a 10- 
percent rebound effect for water heaters. 
(A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 2) It added that 
there is an additional rebound effect for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
because of the promotion of 
‘‘unlimited’’ or ‘‘endless’’ hot water. 
(A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 7) NEEA and 
NPCC suggested that DOE ignore the 
rebound effect except in the case of the 
highest candidate standard levels, as 
adoption of the lower efficiency levels 
would not provide consumers with 
noticeable savings in energy bills. 
(NEEA and NPCC, No. 42 at p. 8) ACEEE 
stated that it does not believe that the 
peer-reviewed literature supports 
assertions of large rebound effects, and 
the more conservative approach is to 
ignore them for these products. (ACEEE, 
No. 35 at p. 7) 
As stated above, the literature does 
indicate the presence of a rebound effect 
of 10 to 40 percent for water heaters. 
Given that NEMS does not incorporate 
a rebound effect for water heating, and 
that the comments received on the 
preliminary analysis support a rebound 
effect of 10 percent or lower, DOE 
believes that using a value at the lower 
end of the range found in the literature 
(i.e., 10 percent) is reasonable and has 
incorporated such an effect in its 
analyses for this NOPR. 
4. Energy Prices 
For the LCC and PBP, DOE derived 
average energy prices for 13 geographic 
areas consisting of the nine U.S. Census 
divisions, with four large States (New 
York, Florida, Texas, and California) 
treated separately. For Census divisions 
containing one of these large States, 
DOE calculated the regional average 
excluding the data for the large State.

65904 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
DOE estimated residential electricity 
prices for each of the 13 geographic 
areas based on data from EIA Form 861, 
‘‘Annual Electric Power Industry 
Database,’’ and EIA Form 826, ‘‘Monthly 
Electric Utility Sales and Revenue 
Data.’’ DOE calculated an average 
annual regional residential electricity 
price by: (1) Estimating an average 
residential price for each utility (by 
dividing the residential revenues by 
residential sales); and (2) weighting 
each utility by the number of residential 
consumers served in that region (based 
on EIA Form 861). DOE calculated an 
average monthly regional electricity 
price by first calculating monthly prices 
for each State, and then calculating a 
regional price by weighting each State 
in a region by the number of consumers 
in that State using EIA Form 826. For 
the preliminary TSD, DOE used EIA 
data from 2006. The NOPR analysis 
used the data from 2007. 
DOE estimated average residential 
natural gas prices in each of the 13 
geographic areas based on data from 
EIA’s Natural Gas Navigator. See Energy 
Information Administration, Natural 
Gas Navigator, 2009; http://
tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_
dcu_nus_m.htm. DOE calculated an 
average natural gas price by first 
calculating the price for each State, and 
then calculating a regional price by 
weighting each State in a region by the 
number of consumers in that State. This 
method differs from the method DOE 
used to calculate electricity prices, 
because EIA does not provide utility- 
level data on gas consumption and 
prices. For the preliminary TSD, DOE 
used EIA data from 2006. For today’s 
proposed rule, DOE used the data from 
2007. 
DOE estimated average residential 
prices for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 
in each of the 13 geographic areas based 
on data from EIA’s State Energy 
Consumption, Price, and Expenditures 
Estimates. See Energy Information 
Administration, 2007 State Energy 
Consumption, Price, and Expenditure 
Estimates (SEDS); http://
www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/
_seds.html. For the preliminary TSD, 
DOE used data from 2005. For today’s 
proposed rule, DOE used the data from 
2006. 
DOE estimated average residential 
prices for oil in each of the 13 
geographic areas based on data from 
EIA’s Petroleum Navigator. See Energy 
Information Administration, Petroleum 
Navigator, December, 2009; http://
tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_
821dsta_a_EPD0_VAR_Mgal_a.htm. For 
the preliminary TSD, DOE used data 
from 2006. For today’s proposed rule, 
DOE used the data from 2007. 
To estimate the trends in energy 
prices for the preliminary TSD, DOE 
used the price forecasts in AEO2008. To 
arrive at prices in future years, DOE 
multiplied current average regional 
prices by the forecast of annual average 
price changes in AEO2008. Because 
AEO2008 forecasts prices to 2030, DOE 
followed past guidelines that EIA 
provided to the Federal Emergency 
Management Program. DOE used the 
average rate of change from 2020 to 
2030 to estimate the price trend for 
electricity after 2030, and the average 
rate of change from 2015 to 2030 to 
estimate the price trend after 2030 for 
natural gas, LPG, and oil. For today’s 
proposed rule, DOE used the same 
approach, but updated its energy price 
forecasts using AEO2009. DOE intends 
to update its energy price forecasts for 
the final rule based on the latest 
available AEO. In addition, the 
spreadsheet tools that DOE used to 
conduct the LCC and PBP analyses 
allow users to select price forecasts from 
either AEO’s high-growth scenario or 
low-growth scenario to estimate the 
sensitivity of the LCC and PBP to 
different energy price forecasts. 
Earthjustice stated that DOE must 
quantify the effect of a CO2 emissions 
cap on energy prices in the LCC 
analysis. (Earthjustice, No. 47 at p. 4) 
DOE believes that it would be 
inappropriate to speculate on the form 
of any Federal carbon control 
legislation, and the ensuing impacts on 
residential energy prices. Therefore, 
DOE does not incorporate such impacts 
into the energy price forecasts that DOE 
used for the NOPR analysis. 
5. Repair and Maintenance Costs 
Repair costs are associated with 
repairing or replacing components that 
have failed in the appliance, whereas 
maintenance costs are associated with 
maintaining the operation of the 
equipment. Determining the repair cost 
involves determining the cost and the 
service life of the components that are 
likely to fail. Discussion of repair and 
maintenance costs for the three types of 
heating products is provided below, 
along with a summary of public 
comments on this topic. For more 
information on DOE’s development of 
repair and maintenance cost estimates, 
see chapter 8 of the NOPR TSD. 
a. Water Heaters 
The repair cost for a water heater 
reflects the cost for a service call when 
the product fails. There are four design 
options considered for the gas-fired 
water heater analysis that may 
encounter repair cost during the lifetime 
of the water heater: (1) Pilot ignition; (2) 
electronic ignition; (3) power vent; and 
(4) condensing design. The energy 
efficiency levels that include power 
vent or condensing design encounter 
both power vent as well as electronic 
ignition repair costs. For each of the 
above four design options, DOE 
estimated both an average cost and the 
year in which the repair would, on 
average, be most likely to occur. 
AHRI stated that DOE’s analysis of 
gas-fired water heaters ignored the 
introduction of FVIR designs that 
require maintenance. (AHRI, No. 43 at 
pp. 1–2) For the NOPR, DOE added a 
cost for maintaining the FVIR for all gas- 
fired storage water heaters. 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
determined that there is virtually no 
maintenance or repair associated with 
conventional electric resistance water 
heaters. For a heat pump water heater, 
maintenance includes annual cleaning 
of the air filter and a preventive 
maintenance cost to check the 
evaporator and refrigeration system. 
Although the literature suggests that no 
professional help is necessary for this 
maintenance, DOE believes there are 
instances in which such help is needed. 
For some locations where the heat 
pump water heater might be more 
exposed to the outdoor environment, 
such as garages and crawlspaces, DOE 
applied a 5-year preventative 
maintenance cost based on experience 
with heat pump water heater outdoor 
installations in Australia, which has 
roughly comparable conditions as much 
of the United States. See Rheem 
Manufacturing Company (Australia), 
Owners Guide and Installation 
Instruction: Air Sourced Heat Pump 
Water Heater, 2006; http:// 
www.rheem.com.au/images/pdf/ 
owners_heatpump_126524B_0610.pdf. 
DOE estimated that 27 percent of these 
exposed installations would require this 
maintenance, based on a survey 
conducted for central air conditioners, 
which include heat exchangers that 
operate similarly as the evaporator heat 
exchanger in a heat pump water heater. 
ACEEE recommended that DOE use 
refrigerator maintenance costs for heat 
pump water heaters because of 
similarities in the components and 
operation. (ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 6) A.O. 
Smith stated that the cost for regular 
and routine maintenance on heat pump 
water heaters must be considered. It 
added that it is inaccurate to compare a 
heat pump water heater to a refrigerator 
due to the much longer duty cycle on 
a heat pump water heater, the slow 
recovery time, the need for frequent 
cleaning, and the scale build-up on the

water side, which is not an issue with 
refrigerators. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 
8) GE stated that DOE ascribed 
inappropriate maintenance costs to heat 
pump water heaters, which require no 
more attention than a standard room air 
conditioner. (GE, No. 51 at p. 2) 
In response, DOE notes that it based 
its maintenance costs for heat pump 
water heaters on experience in 
Australia, so it is not necessary to use 
another appliance as a proxy. DOE 
acknowledges that many heat pump 
water heaters may require little or no 
maintenance. However, DOE believes 
that because the field experience with 
heat pump water heaters is limited, it is 
reasonable to apply a maintenance cost 
for some installations. As described 
above, DOE applied a 5-year 
preventative maintenance cost for 27 
percent of the installations in garages 
and crawlspaces. 
Regarding repair of conventional 
electric resistance water heaters, ACEEE 
stated that data may be available on the 
number of resistive elements that need 
to be replaced. (ACEEE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 211) Based on 
this comment, for the NOPR, DOE 
added a cost for replacing resistive 
elements at least once during the 
lifetime for one-fourth of installations. 
For heat pump water heaters, DOE 
considered the cost of replacing the 
compressor and the evaporator fan and 
the year in which, on average, they 
would be expected to fail. DOE used a 
lifetime distribution for the compressor 
and evaporator fan with an average 
lifetime of 19 years. For the majority of 
households, the compressor and 
evaporator fan would likely not fail 
during the water heater’s lifetime. 
However, because there is some overlap 
between the lifetime distribution used 
for the compressor and evaporator fan 
and the lifetime distribution used for 
electric water heaters (see below), DOE 
included a compressor and evaporator 
fan repair cost in the appropriate year 
for some households. DOE requests 
comments on its analysis of repair and 
maintenance costs for heat pump water 
heaters. This is identified as issue 14 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR. 
Regarding repair costs of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, AGA stated 
that DOE needs to account for 
incremental design options, particularly 
electronic ignition maintenance and 
replacement. (AGA, No. 44 at p. 4) In its 
preliminary analysis, DOE already 
applied a distribution of costs for 
electronic ignition repair based on RS 
Means. It maintained the same approach 
for the NOPR analysis. 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
applied a maintenance cost for some 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters to 
address the fouling of the heat 
exchanger from hard water, periodic 
sensor inspections, and filter changes. 
A.O. Smith stated that $85 per year is 
too low for annual maintenance (de- 
liming) for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 7) In 
response, for the NOPR, DOE used a 
distribution of costs for maintenance of 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters, 
not a single cost of $85, and also applied 
no cost for some installations. 
Noritz stated that the basis for 
including de-liming costs for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters is clauses in 
the warranty, which is standard for all 
water heaters, so de-liming costs should 
not be included only for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. (Noritz, 
No. 36 at p. 2) Noritz stated that the 
necessity for de-liming varies, so it 
would be best not to include the cost for 
any class of water heater, but if it is 
included for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters, DOE should account for 
the fact that it is not necessary for every 
installation. (Noritz, No. 36 at pp. 2–3) 
DOE agrees that de-liming is not 
necessary for every installation, so in 
the NOPR analysis, it assigned zero cost 
to a fraction of households. 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
determined that maintenance for oil- 
fired water heaters is most frequently 
performed under annual maintenance 
contracts, which typically include 
repair of failed components. DOE 
estimated the average cost of separate 
maintenance/repair contracts only for 
water heaters as $153 per year. This 
mean value comes from a collection of 
annual maintenance contract prices, 
which were gathered from web sites that 
represent oil-fired product suppliers in 
the eastern U.S. The same maintenance 
cost applies to all energy efficiency 
levels. DOE did not receive any 
comments on this topic, so it 
maintained the same approach for the 
NOPR analysis. 
Bock stated that DOE did not include 
the cost of annually flushing oil-fired 
storage water heaters. (Bock, No. 53 at 
p. 2) For the NOPR, DOE included a cost 
for flushing the tanks of all storage 
water heaters, including oil-fired storage 
water heaters. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
determined that maintenance cost data 
for gas-fired furnaces provide a 
reasonable approximation of 
maintenance costs for DHE because of 
the similarity in design and operation. 
DOE derived the costs from a field 
survey sponsored by several gas utilities 
that estimated the average total service 
charge (parts, labor, and other charges). 
See Jakob, F. E., et al., Assessment of 
Technology for Improving the Efficiency 
of Residential Gas Furnaces and Boilers, 
1994. Gas Research Institute. Chicago, 
IL. Report No. GRI–94/0175. DOE used 
a maintenance frequency of once every 
5 years for all direct heating equipment. 
DOE determined the repair costs for 
DHE using an approach that reflects the 
cost and the service life of the 
components that are likely to fail. The 
non-condensing designs DOE 
considered that may encounter repair 
costs during the lifetime of the product 
include pilot ignition, electronic 
ignition, circulating blower, and 
induced draft. The repair cost of the 
condensing design includes electronic 
ignition, circulation blower, and 
induced draft components. DOE did not 
receive comments on maintenance and 
repair costs for DHE, so it continued to 
use the existing approach for its NOPR 
analysis. 
c. Pool Heaters 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
determined that most pool owners do 
not perform any pool heater 
maintenance except when the heater 
does not come on. In such situations, 
the maintenance work includes 
checking controls, cleaning burners, 
cleaning the heat exchanger, starting the 
heater, and measuring water 
temperature rise. DOE used an average 
cost of $351. For units employing power 
vent and condensing design options, 
maintenance also includes measuring 
combustion differential pressure. For 
these units, DOE used an average cost of 
$491 and estimated that the 
maintenance occurs on average in the 
fifth year of the pool heater lifetime. 
Raypak stated that pool heaters need 
maintenance more than every 5 years 
due to outdoor installation. (Raypak, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 
215) DOE applied a distribution ranging 
from 3 to 6 years for pool heater 
maintenance. Thus, some applications 
would receive maintenance more than 
once every 5 years. 
Pool heater design options that may 
encounter repair cost during the lifetime 
of the pool heater include pilot ignition, 
electronic ignition, and power vents. 
For each of these, DOE estimated the 
average repair cost and when in the 
product lifetime such repair would be 
likely to occur. DOE continued to use 
the above approach for the NOPR 
analysis.

6. Product Lifetime 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
used a variety of sources to establish 
minimum, average, and maximum 
values for the lifetime of each of the 
three types of heating products. For 
each product class, DOE characterized 
the product lifetime using a Weibull 
probability distribution that ranged from 
minimum to maximum lifetime 
estimates. See chapter 8 of the NOPR 
TSD for further details on the sources 
DOE used to develop product lifetimes. 
For the preliminary TSD, DOE chose 
average lifetimes for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters based on 
the values in the middle of each range: 
12 years for gas units and 14 years for 
electric units. In the NOPR analysis, 
DOE found that applying the above 
values to historic shipments resulted in 
estimates of the stock of gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters that did 
not match the data on the stock reported 
in the Census Bureau’s 2007 American 
Housing Survey (AHS), which covers all 
housing units in the United States. The 
estimated stock is too small for gas-fired 
water heaters and too large for electric 
water heaters. Using an average lifetime 
of 13 years for both gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters produces 
stock estimates for 2007 that are close to 
the stock numbers from the AHS. 
Furthermore, several sources report a 
lifetime of 13 years. (See chapter 8 of 
the NOPR TSD.) Therefore, DOE used an 
average lifetime of 13 years for both gas- 
fired and electric storage water heaters 
in its NOPR analysis. 
DOE evaluated whether electric heat 
pump water heaters have a different 
lifetime from the baseline products. An 
accelerated durability test of heat pump 
water heaters conducted by Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory suggests that these 
units have similar lifetime as standard 
electric resistance storage water heaters. 
Therefore, DOE used the same lifetime 
for all efficiency levels considered for 
this product class. 
For gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, DOE used a distribution with 20 
years as the average lifetime for these 
units in its preliminary analysis. A.O. 
Smith stated that a 20-year lifetime for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters is 
too long, and there is not adequate data 
to backup this claim. (A.O. Smith, No. 
37 at p. 2) BWC stated that DOE’s 
average lifetime for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters is derived 
from manufacturer literature and it 
suggested that DOE instead use an 
independent source for this information. 
(BWC, No. 46 at p. 2) DOE is not aware 
of and the commenters did not provide 
any other source of data on the lifetime 
of gas-fired instantaneous water heaters, 
so it used the same distribution as in the 
preliminary analysis. 
For oil-fired storage water heaters, 
DOE used 9 years as the average 
lifetime. Bock stated that oil-fired 
storage water heaters should have the 
same lifetime as gas-fired storage water 
heaters because they are identical in 
material, construction, volume, and 
storage temperature. (Bock, No. 53 at p. 
2) For the NOPR analysis, DOE used the 
same lifetime for oil-fired storage water 
heaters as for gas-fired storage water 
heaters (i.e., 13 years). 
For direct heating equipment, DOE 
used the average, minimum, and 
maximum lifetime values from its 1993 
TSD for direct heating equipment 
because it did not find more recent 
representative data. The average lifetime 
DOE used for each of the product 
classes was 15 years. DOE did not 
receive any comments on DHE lifetime, 
so it continued to use the above values 
for the NOPR. 
For pool heaters, DOE used 8 years as 
an average lifetime based on the 
available data. DOE did not receive any 
comments on pool heater lifetime, so it 
continued to use the above value for the 
NOPR. 
7. Discount Rates 
To establish discount rates for the 
heating products in the preliminary 
analysis, DOE derived estimates of the 
finance cost of purchasing these 
appliances. Because the purchase of 
equipment for new homes entails 
different costs for consumers than the 
purchase of replacement equipment, 
DOE used different discount rates for 
new construction and replacement. See 
chapter 8 of this NOPR’s TSD for further 
details on the development of discount 
rates for heating products. 
DOE estimated discount rates for 
appliance purchases in new housing 
using the effective real mortgage rate for 
homebuyers, which accounts for 
deducting mortgage interest for income 
tax purposes, and an adjustment for 
inflation. DOE developed a distribution 
of mortgage interest rates using data 
from the Federal Reserve Board’s 
‘‘Survey of Consumer Finances’’ (SCF) 
for 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, and 
2004. For today’s NOPR, DOE added 
data from the 2007 SCF. Because the 
mortgage rates carried by households in 
these years were established over a 
range of time, DOE believes they are 
representative of rates that may apply 
when amended standards take effect. 
The effective real interest rates on 
mortgages across the six surveys 
averaged 3.0 percent. 
DOE’s approach for deriving discount 
rates for replacement purchases 
involved identifying all possible debt or 
asset classes that might be used to 
purchase replacement products, 
including household assets that might 
be affected indirectly. DOE used data 
from the surveys mentioned above to 
estimate the average percentages of the 
various debt and equity classes in the 
average U.S. household portfolios. DOE 
used SCF data and other sources to 
develop distributions of interest or 
return rates associated with each type of 
equity and debt. For today’s NOPR, DOE 
added data from the 2007 SCF. The 
average rate across all types of 
household debt and equity, weighted by 
the shares of each class, is 4.8 percent. 
8. Compliance Date of the Amended 
Standards 
In the context of EPCA, the 
compliance date is the future date when 
parties subject to the requirements of a 
new standard must begin to comply. As 
described in DOE’s semi-annual 
implementation report for energy 
conservation standards activities 
submitted to Congress pursuant to 
section 141 of EPACT 2005, a final rule 
for the three types of heating products 
that are the subject of this rulemaking is 
scheduled to be completed by March 
2010. Compliance with amended energy 
efficiency standards for direct heating 
equipment and pool heaters is required 
three years after the final rule is 
published in the Federal Register (in 
2013); compliance with amended 
standards for water heaters is required 
five years after the final rule is 
published (in 2015). DOE calculated the 
LCC for the three types of heating 
products as if consumers would 
purchase new products in the year 
compliance with the standard is 
required. 
Earthjustice stated that DOE assumes 
a 5-year lead time to be consistent with 
the requirements in 42 U.S.C. 
6295(e)(4)(B), which requires that DOE 
‘‘publish a final rule no later than 
January 1, 2000 to determine whether 
standards in effect * * * should be 
amended,’’ and that ‘‘any such 
amendment shall apply to products 
manufactured on or after January 1, 
2005.’’ The commenter stated that this 
assumption is contrary to the structure 
and purpose of the statute. It also 
declared that there is no statutory 
language to deal with the current 
situation, which involves determining a 
compliance date for a standard that DOE 
was required to adopt nearly 10 years 
ago. Earthjustice stated that the required 
publication date and compliance dates 
have passed, and that it is unreasonable

65907 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
to apply the 5-year lead time specified 
in 42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4)(B). (Earthjustice, 
No. 47 at p. 5) ASAP stated that DOE’s 
compliance date of 2015 is arbitrary 
because the law states that compliance 
with the standard is required by 2005. 
ASAP stated that DOE is obligated to 
use time as a variable and look at a 
range of implementation dates for all of 
the standard levels to determine the 
standard that would best meet the 
statutory criteria. ASAP suggested that 
DOE analyze a range of compliance 
dates from 18 months to 8 years after 
publication of the final rule. (ASAP, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at 
pp. 57–58) AHRI stated that DOE is 
obligated to allow five years between 
the final rule and the compliance date 
for the requirements for water heater 
products. (AHRI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 60–61) 
In response, DOE notes that the 
language in 42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4) 
specifically states that amended 
standards, if any, shall apply to 
products manufactured on or after the 
36-month period beginning on the date 
such a final rule is published for the 
first iteration of rulemaking and on or 
after the 60-month period beginning on 
the date such a final rule is published 
for the second iteration of rulemaking. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4)(A)–(B)) The 
language of 42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4)(B) 
anticipates that a standard will be in 
place for covered water heaters that are 
manufactured precisely five years after 
publication of the final rule and 
prospectively thereafter. DOE believes 
that the time differential, as specified in 
EPCA, between the publication of the 
final rule and the compliance deadline 
reflects Congress’s judgment as to what 
constitutes adequate lead time. 
9. Product Energy Efficiency in the Base 
Case 
To accurately estimate the percentage 
of consumers who would be affected by 
a particular standard level, DOE’s 
analysis considered the projected 
distribution of product efficiencies that 
consumers purchase under the base case 
(i.e., the case without new energy 
efficiency standards). DOE refers to this 
distribution as a base-case efficiency 
distribution. Using the projected 
distribution of product efficiencies for 
each heating product, DOE randomly 
assigned a specific product efficiency to 
each sample household. If a household 
was assigned a product efficiency 
greater than or equal to the efficiency of 
the standard level under consideration, 
the LCC calculation shows that this 
household is not affected by that 
standard level. Each of the three types 
of heating products is addressed below, 
including relevant public comments and 
DOE’s response. For further information 
on DOE’s estimation of base-case market 
shares, see chapter 8 of the NOPR TSD. 
a. Water Heaters 
In its preliminary analysis, DOE 
estimated the base-case market shares of 
various energy efficiency levels for 
water heaters in the effective year. DOE 
began with data on shipments for 2002– 
2006 from AHRI, supplemented with 
data on the number of water heater 
models at different energy efficiency 
levels reported in AHRI directories and 
the Federal Trade Commission 
directory. (See chapter 8 of the NOPR 
TSD for citations for these data sources.) 
For gas-fired and electric storage water 
heaters, DOE then estimated the future 
market impact of the ENERGY STAR 
program. Effective in 2010, the 
minimum efficiency for the ENERGY 
STAR designation will be 0.67 EF for 
non-condensing gas-fired storage water 
heaters, 0.80 EF for condensing gas-fired 
storage water heaters, and 2.0 EF for 
heat pump water heaters. To estimate 
the base-case market shares of these 
products, DOE considered the market 
penetration goals set by the ENERGY 
STAR program. 
For gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, DOE estimated that the base- 
case market shares in 2015 would be 
equivalent to current shares. In the case 
of this product, the majority of the 
market (approximately 85 percent of 
shipments) is already at the ENERGY 
STAR level, so there is limited room for 
the shares of ENERGY STAR products to 
increase in the near future. For oil-fired 
storage water heaters, DOE also 
estimated that the market shares in 2015 
would be equivalent to current shares, 
as there has been little change in the 
past decade. 
Southern and EEI stated that the 5- 
percent market share DOE projected for 
heat pump water heaters under the base 
case seems too high. (Southern, Public 
Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 186; 
EEI, No. 40 at p. 5) GE stated that based 
on the expansion of the market for front- 
loading clothes washers, which was a 
new higher-efficiency product in the 
U.S. market with higher first cost but 
much lower operating costs, the 
predicted 5-percent market share for 
heat pump water heaters is not 
unreasonable. (GE, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at pp. 188–189) In 
response, DOE notes that, consistent 
with manufacturer predictions, heat 
pump water heaters entered the mass 
market in 2009. Given the high level of 
interest in promoting ENERGY STAR- 
qualified appliances, DOE believes that 
its projection was reasonable, and it 
used the same market share for the 
NOPR analysis. 
For oil-fired storage water heaters, 
Bock stated that the market shares for 
Efficiency Level 5 and 6 are much 
higher than indicated in the preliminary 
TSD. (Bock, No. 34.4 at pp. 187–188) 
For the NOPR, DOE updated its base- 
case efficiency distribution to reflect 
data from the March 2009 AHRI 
directory of certified products, which 
resulted in a higher market share at 
levels 5 and 6. 
DOE’s projected base-case energy 
efficiency market shares are shown in 
Table IV.28. These market shares 
represent the products that households 
would purchase in 2015 in the absence 
of revised energy conservation 
standards.

b. DHE 
Little is known about the efficiency 
distribution of direct heating equipment 
that consumers in the United States 
currently purchase. For the preliminary 
analysis, DOE estimated the market 
shares of different energy efficiency 
levels within each product class in the 
base case using data in the March 2007 
GAMA directory. DOE did not receive 
any comments on its estimation of base- 
case market shares for DHE. It employed 
the same approach for its NOPR 
analysis, but used more recent GAMA 
data on the number of models at 
different energy efficiency levels. See 
Gas Appliance Manufacturers 
Association, Consumer’s Directory of 
Certified Efficiency Ratings for Heating 
and Water Heating Equipment (March 
2008); http://www.gamanet.org/gama/ 
inforesources.nsf/vAllDocs/ 
Product+Directories?OpenDocument. 
c. Pool Heaters 
No shipments data are available on 
the distribution of gas-fired pool heaters 
by energy efficiency level. For the 
preliminary TSD, DOE estimated the 
market shares of different energy 
efficiency levels in the base-case by 
using data from the FTC on the number 
of gas-fired pool heater models at 
different energy efficiency levels as a 
proxy for shipments. DOE did not 
receive any comments on its estimation 
of base-case market shares for pool 
heaters. It employed the same approach 
for the NOPR analysis, but used more 
recent FTC data on the numbers of 
models at various energy efficiency 
levels. 
10. Inputs to Payback Period Analysis 
The payback period is the amount of 
time it takes the consumer to recover the 
additional installed cost of more- 
efficient products, compared to baseline 
products, through energy cost savings. 
The simple payback period does not 
account for changes in operating 
expense over time or the time value of 
money. Payback periods are expressed 
in years. Payback periods that exceed 
the life of the product mean that the 
increased total installed cost is not 
recovered in reduced operating 
expenses. 
The inputs to the PBP calculation are 
the total installed cost of the equipment 
to the customer for each efficiency level 
and the annual (first-year) operating 
expenditures for each efficiency level. 
The PBP calculation uses the same 
inputs as the LCC analysis, except that 
energy price trends and discount rates 
are not needed. 
NEEA and NPCC stated that that they 
are concerned about how the payback 
period was calculated for efficiency 
level 3 for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters (0.80 EF) because of the lengthy 
payback period. (NEEA & NPCC, No. 42 
at p. 2) In response, DOE notes that 
almost the entire market is at CSL 3 or 
higher. Therefore, the PBP that DOE 
calculated applies only to the very few 
households that would be affected by a 
standard at this level. There is a 
significant cost differential in going 
from CSL 1 and 2 to CSL 3, which leads 
to very high PBPs for the affected 
households. 
11. Rebuttable-Presumption Payback 
Period 
The PBP analysis helps to determine 
whether the 3-year rebuttable 
presumption of economic justification 
applies—that is, whether the purchaser 
will recover the higher installed cost of 
more-efficient equipment through 
lowered operating costs within 3 years. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) For each 
efficiency level it considered, DOE 
determined the value of the first year’s 
energy savings by calculating the 
quantity of those savings in accordance 
with DOE’s test procedure, and 
multiplying that amount by the average 
energy price forecast for the year in 
which a new standard is expected to 
take effect. Section V.B.1.c of this notice 
and chapter 8 of the NOPR TSD present 
the rebuttable presumption PBP results. 
Earthjustice stated the DOE must 
justify any refusal to adopt standard 
levels at least as strong as those that 
satisfy the rebuttable presumption 
payback period. (Earthjustice, No. 47 at 
p. 3) The LCC and PBP analyses 
generate values that calculate the 
payback period for consumers of 
potential energy conservation standards; 
these include, but are not limited to, the 
3-year payback period contemplated 
under the rebuttable presumption test 
discussed above. However, DOE 
routinely conducts an economic 
analysis that considers the full range of 
impacts, including those to the 
consumer, manufacturer, Nation, and 
environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i) and 42 U.S.C. 
6316(e)(1)). The results of this analysis 
serve as the basis for DOE to definitively 
evaluate the economic justification for a 
potential standard level, thereby 
supporting or rebutting the results of 
any preliminary determination of 
economic justification. 
F. National Impact Analysis—National 
Energy Savings and Net Present Value 
Analysis 
The national impact analysis assesses 
the national energy savings and the net 
present national impact analysis 
assesses the national energy savings and 
the net present value of total product 
costs and savings expected to result 
from standards at specific efficiency 
levels. DOE used the NIA spreadsheet to 
calculate energy savings and NPV, using 
the annual energy consumption and 
total installed cost data from the LCC 
analysis. DOE forecasted the energy 
savings, energy cost savings, product 
costs, and NPV for each product class 
from 2013 (or 2015) through 2043 (or 
2045). The forecasts provided annual 
and cumulative values for the above 
output parameters. In addition, DOE 
used its NIA spreadsheet to analyze 
scenarios that used inputs from the 
AEO2009 Low Economic Growth and 
High Economic Growth cases. These 
cases have higher and lower energy 
price trends compared to the Reference 
case, as well as higher and lower 
housing starts, which result in higher 
and lower appliance shipments to new 
homes. 
Earthjustice stated that DOE needs to 
consider the impact of increased 
employment and reduced emissions in 
its national impact analysis. 
(Earthjustice, No. 47 at p. 1) NRDC 
stated that DOE failed to include the 
benefits of avoided carbon emissions in

the NIA. (NRDC, No. 48 at p. 5) In 
response, DOE accounts for the impacts 
on employment in the employment 
impact analysis (section IV.I), and it 
quantifies avoided carbon emissions in 
the environmental assessment (section 
IV.K).The NIA primarily considers the 
national energy savings and the NPV 
from a national perspective of total 
appliance consumer costs and savings 
expected to result from standards, and 
it also evaluates the benefits to the 
economy of reduced energy prices due 
to standards. Even though employment 
and reduced emissions are separately 
addressed outside the NIA, DOE 
thoroughly considers these issues when 
conducting its analyses in the context of 
standard setting. 
Table IV.29 summarizes the approach 
and data DOE used to derive the inputs 
to the NES and NPV analyses for the 
preliminary analysis and the changes to 
the analyses for the proposed rule. A 
discussion of these inputs and changes 
follows. See chapter 10 of the NOPR

1. Shipments 
The shipments portion of the NIA 
spreadsheet is a model that uses 
historical data as a basis for projecting 
future shipments of the appliance 
products that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. In projecting shipments for 
water heaters and pool heaters, DOE 
accounted for two market segments: (1) 
New construction and (2) replacement 
of failed equipment. Data were 
unavailable to develop separate 
forecasts of direct heating equipment 
shipments for replacement and new 
home installations, so the forecast was 
based on the time series of historical 
total shipments developed for each 
product class. 
Table IV.30 summarizes the approach 
and data DOE used to derive the inputs 
to the shipments analysis for the 
preliminary analysis, and the changes 
DOE made for today’s proposed rule. A 
discussion of these inputs and changes

To determine new construction 
shipments, DOE used forecasts of 
housing starts coupled with estimates of 
product market saturation in new 
housing. For the preliminary analysis, 
DOE used actual data for 2007 for new 
housing completions and mobile home 
placements and adopted the projections 
from AEO2008 for 2008 to 2030. DOE 
updated its new housing projections for 
today’s proposed rule using AEO2009. 
DOE estimated replacements using 
historical shipments data and product 
retirement functions that it developed 
from product lifetimes. 
AHRI stated that shipments for all of 
the products dropped considerably in 
2008, and this drop will change the 
forecast since today’s new house 
installation is tomorrow’s replacement 
installation. (AHRI, No. 33 at p. 2) In 
response, DOE’s NOPR analysis used 
actual shipments data for 2008, so any 
such changes are captured in DOE’s 
analysis. 
a. Water Heaters 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
used information on choice of water 
heater products in recently-built 
housing to estimate shipments to the 
new construction market. DOE assumed 
the market shares of water heaters using 
a particular fuel follow the average 
pattern in new homes for 2000 to 2006 
throughout the forecast period. The 
shipments model assumes that when a 
unit using a particular fuel is retired, it 
generally is replaced with a unit that 
uses the same fuel. Section IV.F.1.d 
discusses the potential effects of energy 
conservation standards on choice of 
water heater product in the new 
construction and replacement markets. 
For its shipments forecast for gas-fired 
storage water heaters and electric 
storage water heaters, DOE assumed that 
the current market shares of small- 
volume and large-volume products 
would remain the same throughout the 
forecast period. 
Within the category of gas-fired water 
heaters, DOE disaggregated the shares of 
gas storage water heaters and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters based on 
projections of total shipments of gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters. 
Because there is much uncertainty about 
the future growth of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, DOE 
modeled three scenarios for their market 
penetration. The scenarios are based on 
experience with gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters in Australia, where the 
proportion of instantaneous water 
heaters in total gas-fired storage water 
heater shipments has grown 
considerably in the past decade. (See 
Syneca Consulting, Cost-Benefit 
Analysis: Proposal to Introduce a 
Minimum Energy Performance Standard 
for Gas Water Heaters, 2007, Australian 
Greenhouse Office: Equipment Energy 
Efficiency Gas Committee.) Residential 
water heating services and technology 
in Australia are roughly comparable to 
those in the United States. Storage water 
heaters have somewhat lower volume 
capacities in Australia, but end-use hot 
water demand also may be lower. Prices 
of gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
in Australia are roughly comparable to 
prices of gas-fired storage water heaters 
(excluding installation costs). In the 
United States, gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters currently cost about twice 
as much as typical 40-gallon gas storage 
water heaters. Although the price 
differential in the United States likely 
will decrease, the specifics of the United 
States market probably will not 
duplicate the market in Australia. 
Nonetheless, DOE believes that the 
market evolution in Australia provides 
the most similar model for scenarios for 
the United States. 
AHRI stated that the Australian water 
heater market has significant differences 
from the U.S. market because in 
Australia: (1) Gas water heaters are not 
the prevalent residential option; (2) 
many gas water heaters are installed 
outside; and (3) prices of gas storage 
water heaters and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters are 
practically equal. (AHRI, No. 43 at p. 2) 
Rheem stated that in Australia, most 
water heaters are installed outdoors, 
which makes a difference in terms of the 
venting and total installation cost. 
(Rheem, Public Meeting Transcript, No. 
34.4 at p. 241) A.O. Smith commented 
that the scenario for low market 
penetration of gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters may be reasonable, but the 
other two scenarios over-predict the 
market penetration. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 
at p. 7) Noritz stated that Australia is the 
only market it has identified that could 
provide any insight into the adoption of 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters in 
the United States. (Noritz, No. 36 at 
p. 3) 
In response, DOE acknowledges the 
uncertainty associated with basing 
forecasted market penetration of gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters on the 
Australian experience, but it agrees with 
Noritz (the largest manufacturer of these 
products) that there is no other market 
that could provide a model for 
forecasting U.S. market penetration. In 
making use of the Australian 
experience, DOE took into account some 
of the differences between the two 
markets that would tend to cause 
shipments growth to be lower in the 
U.S. For further details on the 
shipments forecast for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, see chapter 
9 of the NOPR TSD. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment 
To estimate historical shipments of 
direct heating equipment for the 
preliminary analysis, DOE used two sets 
of data from AHRI and information from 
the 1993 TSD. Data were unavailable to 
develop separate forecasts of direct 
heating equipment shipments for 
replacement and new home 
installations, so DOE based the forecast 
on the time series of historical total 
shipments developed for each product 
class. To forecast shipments of gas room 
DHE, shipments of room heaters were 
held constant at the average level from

2002 to 2005, and gas fireplace 
shipments (referred to as hearth 
products DHE in this NOPR) assigned to 
gas room DHE were held constant at the 
average from 2002 to 2004. Forecasted 
floor furnaces shipments follow the 
downward trend from 2000 to 2007. 
Total combined shipments of gas wall 
gravity and gas wall fan DHE were held 
constant at the average volume from 
2002 to 2006. The upward trend seen 
from 2002 to 2006 was extrapolated into 
the future for gas wall fan DHE. DOE 
derived future shipments of gas wall 
gravity DHE based on the combined 
shipments of gas wall gravity and gas 
wall fan DHE and the forecast 
shipments for the latter. Shipments of 
gas fireplaces assigned to gas wall fan 
DHE were kept constant at the average 
from 2002 to 2004. 
Commenting on DOE’s forecast, HPBA 
stated that gas fireplace shipments will 
likely decrease as opposed to staying 
level. (HPBA, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 258) Apart 
from a decrease due to the 2008–2009 
economic recession, DOE is not aware of 
reasons why gas fireplace (hearth 
products) shipments would be expected 
to decrease, given that the number of 
U.S. households will continue to 
increase. However, based on its review 
of market information, DOE modified its 
forecast of gas hearth products 
shipments. The forecast used for the 
NOPR accounts for the sharp decline in 
shipments in 2007–2008, but assumes 
that shipments in the future will 
approximately follow the trend seen in 
1998–2007. 
In addition, DOE modified its forecast 
of gas wall gravity and gas wall fan DHE 
to better reflect current information. 
Instead of having different trends for 
each of these product classes, as in the 
preliminary analysis, DOE assumed that 
shipments of each class would stay 
constant at the 2008 level during the 
forecast period. 
c. Pool Heaters 
To forecast pool heater shipments for 
new construction for the preliminary 
analysis, DOE multiplied the annual 
housing starts forecasted for single- 
family and multi-family housing by the 
estimated saturation of gas-fired pool 
heaters in recently built new housing. 
For replacement pool heaters, DOE used 
a survival function based on its 
distribution of product lifetimes to 
determine when a unit fails. DOE also 
introduced a market segment 
representing purchases by existing 
households that had not owned a pool 
heater. These first-time owners include 
existing households that have a pool 
and those that install one. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE’s 
projected that pool heater shipments 
would grow significantly from 0.28 
million in 2006 to over 0.7 million by 
2040. Raypak stated that the slope of the 
shipments forecast for pool heaters 
should be consistent with the past 10 
years of data, which show that the slope 
is either constant or decreasing due to 
economic reasons. It also stated that 
pool heater new construction shipments 
are declining because of lot size issues 
and other restrictions. (Raypak, No. 34.4 
at p. 247) EEI stated that projected pool 
heater shipments are overstated and that 
DOE should obtain more recent 
numbers to develop more realistic 
projections for shipments. (EEI, No. 40 
at pp. 5–6) In response, DOE revised the 
NOPR analysis to account for those 
households that are not likely to replace 
their pool heater when it fails due to 
cost. As a result, the shipments 
projection shows only modest growth 
over the analysis period. 
d. Impacts of Standards on Shipments 
In some of its energy conservation 
standard rulemakings, DOE has used 
elasticities to estimate the response of 
appliance demand (shipments) to 
changes in the installed cost and 
operating costs associated with more- 
efficient appliances. Typically, higher 
installed costs of more-efficient 
appliances are projected to cause some 
consumers to forego purchase of a new 
product. 
In the case of water heaters, however, 
DOE believes that this approach would 
not be appropriate because the 
consumer (or home builder) decision is 
usually not whether to purchase the 
product or not, but rather what type of 
water heater to buy. A water heater is 
generally not a discretionary purchase. 
However, to the extent that energy 
conservation standards result in an 
increase in the price of a specific type 
of water heater compared to a 
competing product, some consumers (or 
home builders in the case of shipments 
for new construction) may purchase the 
competing product. The consumer or 
builder decision is not solely based on 
economic factors, as the availability of 
natural gas plays a key role. Evaluation 
of this decision requires an assessment 
of the specific factors that influence it 
in the context of the two main markets 
for water heaters, replacements and new 
homes. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
determined that the greatest potential 
for product switching would exist in the 
case of a standard that effectively 
required an electric heat pump water 
heater. This type of product often has a 
substantially higher installed cost than 
a typical electric resistance storage 
water heater and is relatively new to 
consumers and builders. Because the 
product choice decision partially 
depends on the relative costs of 
competing products, DOE considered 
the following potential combinations of 
electric and gas-fired storage water 
heaters that could result from standards: 
(1) Electric heat pump water heater and 
a gas-fired storage water heater using 
natural draft; (2) electric heat pump 
water heater and a gas-fired storage 
water heater using a power vent; and (3) 
electric heat pump water heater and a 
gas-fired storage water heater using 
condensing technology. DOE used data 
from the 2001 RECS to estimate the 
percentage of households expected to 
purchase an electric water heater in the 
base case that could switch to a gas-fired 
water heater because they had the 
necessary infrastructure. To estimate 
how many households that could switch 
to gas-fired water heaters would do so, 
DOE considered the difference in 
installed cost between the gas-fired 
storage water heater and an electric heat 
pump water heater in each of the 
combinations listed above. 
DOE did not quantify the potential for 
switching to gas water heating in the 
case of a standard that requires 0.95 EF 
for electric water heaters, as the 
installed cost is only moderately higher 
than the baseline electric water heater 
(0.90 EF), and DOE judged that this 
would not be sufficient to prompt 
consumers to consider switching to gas 
water heating. 
ACEEE stated that because builders 
make the choices that lock in 
subsequent energy source decisions at 
the time of construction, converting to 
a different energy source for water 
heating is too costly. However, it added 
that a few consumers in existing houses 
would choose gas conversion over 
installing a heat pump water heater. 
(ACEEE, No. 35 at pp. 6–7) NEEA and 
NPCC commented that most water 
heater replacements are on an 
emergency basis and that there is no 
convincing argument to include fuel 
switching in the analysis. (NEEA and 
NPCC, No. 42 at p. 9) 
DOE agrees with the comment from 
ACEEE but it also notes that not all 
water heater replacements are on an 
emergency basis. DOE believes that the 
cost differential estimated in its analysis 
suggests that a small fraction of 
consumers would be likely to switch. 
For the NOPR, DOE used a similar 
approach as for the preliminary analysis 
using data from the 2005 RECS. 
Southern stated that many consumers 
would switch to a gas-fired storage 
water heater instead of installing a heat

pump water heater even if the installed 
cost is more, especially if the heat pump 
water heater would need to be installed 
in an enclosed interior location. 
(Southern, No. 50 at p. 4) DOE’s 
approach took detailed account of those 
situations in which consumers with a 
failed electric storage water heater 
would find it less expensive to switch 
to a gas-fired storage water heater 
instead of installing a heat pump water 
heater. In determining which 
households would switch to a gas-fired 
storage water heater, the analysis 
considered the installed costs that 
consumers might incur if they replaced 
an electric storage water heater located 
indoors with a heat pump water heater. 
(Refer to the discussion of installation 
costs for heat pump water heaters in 
section IV.E.2.a.) Given that an interior 
location may not easily allow the 
venting required with installing a gas- 
fired storage water heater, DOE does not 
believe consumers would switch to a 
gas-fired storage water heater instead of 
installing a heat pump water heater if 
the installed cost of the gas-fired 
product is higher. 
In the NOPR analysis, the fraction of 
households using an electric storage 
water heater estimated to switch to a 
gas-fired storage water heater instead of 
installing a heat pump water heater 
ranges from zero with a standard level 
for gas-fired storage water heaters that 
requires condensing technology, to 9 
percent with a standard level for gas- 
fired storage water heaters that requires 
power vent technology. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
concluded that builders who planned to 
install an electric storage water heater 
would not switch to gas-fired storage 
water heaters in the event of a standard 
that effectively requires heat pump 
technology. A.O. Smith stated that 
builders would be unlikely to switch 
from a heat pump water heater to a gas- 
fired storage water heater due to the cost 
of adding gas to the house, and if gas 
were already supplied to the house, a 
heat pump water heater would not have 
been installed. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 
8) DOE agrees that availability of natural 
gas is the key determining factor for 
builders. Accordingly, DOE’s analysis 
for the NOPR shows negligible 
switching in new homes. 
EEI stated that there may be a switch 
from electric storage to electric 
instantaneous water heaters if DOE 
adopts a standard level that would 
require use of heat pump technology for 
electric storage water heaters. (EEI, No. 
40 at p. 5) DOE acknowledges that some 
households facing extreme structural 
modifications to accommodate a heat 
pump water heater may purchase an 
electric instantaneous water heater 
instead. However, because such 
switching requires expensive electrical 
modification to the home’s electrical 
circuits to accommodate the higher 
electrical demand of instantaneous 
water heaters, DOE believes it is an 
unlikely choice for most households 
with electric water heating. 
With respect to the new construction 
market, in the preliminary analysis, 
DOE concluded that builders who 
planned to install an electric storage 
water heater would not switch to gas- 
fired storage water heaters in the event 
of a standard that effectively requires 
heat pump technology. A.O. Smith 
commented that builders would be 
unlikely to switch from a heat pump 
water heater to a gas-fired storage water 
heater due to the cost of adding gas to 
the house, and if gas had been already 
supplied to the house, a heat pump 
water heater would not have been 
installed. (A.O. Smith, No. 37 at p. 8) 
DOE agrees that availability of natural 
gas is the key factor determining water 
heater choice for home builders. 
Accordingly, DOE’s analysis for the 
NOPR shows negligible switching in 
new homes. 
Regarding potential switching from 
gas-fired water heaters to electric water 
heaters, DOE determined that the cost of 
replacing an existing gas-fired storage 
water heater with an electric one is 
substantial due to the complexity of the 
installation. Because it takes longer for 
an electric storage water heater to 
recover heated capacity, a larger electric 
tank may be necessary to replace a gas 
unit. In new construction, if natural gas 
is available, builders generally will 
install a gas-fired water heater. Given 
the above considerations, in both new 
construction and the replacement 
market, a large increase in the price of 
a gas storage water heater compared to 
an electric storage water heater likely 
would be necessary to motivate 
consumers to replace a gas water heater 
with an electric unit, or to motivate 
builders to install an electric water 
heater instead of a gas unit. Because 
DOE does not envision such a price 
differential resulting from this 
rulemaking, it concluded that amended 
standards would not induce switching 
from a gas storage water heater to an 
electric storage water heater. 
In its preliminary analysis, DOE did 
not quantify the potential for switching 
away from oil-fired water heaters. Bock 
and EEI stated that DOE should consider 
fuel and equipment switching impacts 
of standards on oil-fired equipment. 
(Bock, No. 53 at p. 1; EEI, No. 40 at pp. 
4–5) In response, DOE believes that the 
price of the oil-fired storage water heater 
is a minor factor in the fuel choice 
decision for households with such a 
water heater. In most cases, a household 
with an oil-fired storage water heater 
needing replacement would switch to a 
gas-fired water heater if gas is available 
because of the greater convenience and 
lower cost of gas water heating. 
Therefore, DOE believes that the 
moderately higher equipment price that 
might result from the proposed standard 
level (5 percent) would have a negligible 
impact on fuel switching for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and DOE did not 
include such switching in its NOPR 
analysis. 
In its preliminary analysis, DOE did 
not quantify the potential for switching 
away from gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters due to lack of quantitative 
information about the factors that shape 
the purchase decision for this product. 
However, given that the vast majority of 
the market (85 percent) is already at the 
proposed standard level (0.82 EF), there 
is little reason to expect any switching 
to storage water heaters as a result of the 
proposed standard. 
For DHE and pool heaters, DOE did 
not find any data it could use to 
estimate the extent of switching away 
from the gas-fired products subject to 
this rulemaking if energy conservation 
standards were to result in a significant 
increase in installed costs. DOE did not 
receive any comments on its approach 
for these products, and it maintained 
the same approach for the NOPR 
analysis. 
In summary, DOE projects that no fuel 
switching would occur for gas-fired 
storage, oil-fired storage, and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. For electric 
storage water heaters, DOE estimated 
that a standard that effectively requires 
heat pump water heaters would result in 
a decline in shipments ranging from 
zero to 9 percent, depending on the 
standard level for gas-fired storage water 
heaters. 
DOE requests comments on its 
analysis of fuel switching that may 
result from the proposed standards on 
water heaters and the other heating 
products. In particular, DOE requests 
comments on (1) its general approach, 
which does not involve price 
elasticities; (2) its analysis of switching 
to gas-fired storage water heaters in the 
case of a standard that effectively 
requires an electric heat pump water 
heater; (3) its conclusion that the 
proposed standards would not induce 
switching from a gas storage water 
heater to an electric storage water 
heater; and (4) its conclusion that the 
proposed standards would not induce 
switching for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters, DHE, and pool heaters.

in section VII.E of this NOPR. 
2. Other Inputs 
The following is a discussion of the 
other inputs to the NIA and any 
revisions DOE made to those inputs for 
today’s proposed rule. 
a. Base-Case Forecasted Efficiencies 
A key input to DOE’s estimates of 
NES and NPV is the energy efficiencies 
that DOE forecasts over time for the base 
case (without new standards) and each 
of the standards cases. The forecasted 
efficiencies represent the annual 
shipment-weighted energy efficiency of 
the products under consideration over 
the forecast period. 
For the preliminary analysis, DOE 
used the SWEFs for 2013 or 2015 as a 
starting point to forecast the base-case 
energy efficiency distribution for each 
product class. To represent the 
distribution of product energy 
efficiencies in those years, DOE used the 
same market shares as in the base case 
for the LCC analysis. For gas storage 
water heaters and electric storage water 
heaters, DOE estimated the distribution 
of product energy efficiencies in 2015 
by accounting for the estimated market 
impact of the newly established 
ENERGY STAR efficiency levels for 
water heaters (see section IV.9.a). The 
projected trend to 2015 represents an 
average annual increase in energy 
efficiency of 0.27 percent for gas-fired 
storage water heaters and 0.55 percent 
for electric storage water heaters. DOE 
applied the above values to estimate the 
increase in average energy efficiency 
until the end of the forecast period. 
DOE found no quantifiable 
indications of change in energy 
efficiencies over time for oil-fired and 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters, 
direct heating equipment, or pool 
heaters, and it did not receive any 
comments on this topic. Therefore, for 
these products, DOE estimated that 
energy efficiencies remain constant at 
the 2015 or 2013 level until the end of 
the forecast period. 
For today’s proposed rule, DOE 
maintained the approach described 
above. 
b. Standards-Case Forecasted 
Efficiencies 
For its determination of standards- 
case forecasted efficiencies, DOE used a 
‘‘roll-up’’ scenario in the preliminary 
analysis and the NOPR to establish the 
SWEF for the year that standards would 
become effective and subsequent years. 
In this approach, product energy 
efficiencies in the base case that do not 
meet the standards level under 
consideration would roll up to meet the 
new standard level. The market share of 
energy efficiencies that exceed the 
standard level under consideration 
would be the same in the standards case 
as in the base case. Changes over the 
forecast period match those in the base 
case. For today’s proposed rule, DOE 
maintained this approach. 
c. Annual Energy Consumption 
The inputs for determining NES are 
annual energy consumption per unit, 
shipments, equipment stock, national 
annual energy consumption, and site-to- 
source conversion factors. Because the 
annual energy consumption per unit 
depends directly on efficiency, DOE 
used the SWEFs associated with the 
base case and each standards case, in 
combination with the annual energy use 
data, to estimate the shipment-weighted 
average annual per-unit energy 
consumption under the base case and 
standards cases. The national energy 
consumption is the product of the 
annual energy consumption per unit 
and the number of units of each vintage. 
This calculation accounts for differences 
in unit energy consumption from year to 
year. For today’s proposed rule, DOE 
maintained this approach. 
d. Site-to-Source Energy Conversion 
To estimate the national energy 
savings expected from appliance 
standards, DOE uses a multiplicative 
factor to convert site energy 
consumption (at the home or 
commercial building) into primary or 
source energy consumption (the energy 
required to deliver the site energy). 
These conversion factors account for the 
energy used at power plants to generate 
electricity and losses in transmission 
and distribution, as well as for natural 
gas losses from pipeline leakage and 
energy used for pumping. For 
electricity, the conversion factors vary 
over time due to projected changes in 
generation sources (i.e., the power plant 
types projected to provide electricity to 
the country). The factors that DOE 
developed are marginal values, which 
represent the response of the system to 
an incremental decrease in consumption 
associated with appliance standards. 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE used 
annual site-to-source conversion factors 
based on the version of NEMS that 
corresponds to AEO2008. For today’s 
NOPR, DOE updated its conversion 
factors based on AEO2009. The AEO 
does not provide energy forecasts 
beyond 2030; DOE used conversion 
factors that remain constant at the 2030 
values throughout the remainder of the 
forecast period. 
In response to a request from the 
DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy (EERE), the National 
Research Council (NRC) appointed a 
committee on ‘‘Point-of-Use and Full- 
Fuel-Cycle Measurement Approaches to 
Energy Efficiency Standards’’ to conduct 
a study called for in section 1802 of 
EPACT 2005. The fundamental task 
before the committee was to evaluate 
the methodology used for setting energy 
efficiency standards and to comment on 
whether site (point-of-use) or source 
(full-fuel-cycle) measures of energy 
efficiency better support rulemaking to 
achieve energy conservation goals. The 
NRC committee defined site (point-of- 
use) energy consumption as reflecting 
the use of electricity, natural gas, 
propane, and/or fuel oil by an appliance 
at the site where the appliance is 
operated. Full-fuel-cycle energy 
consumption was defined as including, 
in addition to site energy use, the 
following: Energy consumed in the 
extraction, processing, and transport of 
primary fuels such as coal, oil, and 
natural gas; energy losses in thermal 
combustion in power generation plants; 
and energy losses in transmission and 
distribution to homes and commercial 
buildings. (See The National 
Academies, Board on Energy and 
Environmental Systems, Letter to Dr. 
John Mizroch, Acting Assistant 
Secretary, U.S. DOE, Office of EERE 
from James W. Dally, Chair, Committee 
on Point-of-Use and Full-Fuel-Cycle 
Measurement Approaches to Energy 
Efficiency Standards, May 15, 2009.) 
In evaluating the merits of using 
point-of-use and full-fuel-cycle 
measures, the NRC committee noted 
that DOE uses what the committee 
referred to as ‘‘extended site’’ energy 
consumption to assess the impact of 
energy use on the economy, energy 
security, and environmental quality. 
The extended site measure of energy 
consumption includes the generation, 
transmission, and distribution but, 
unlike the full-fuel-cycle measure, does 
not include the energy consumed in 
extracting, processing, and transporting 
primary fuels. A majority of members on 
the NRC committee concluded that 
extended site energy consumption 
understates the total energy consumed 
to make an appliance operational at the 
site. As a result, the NRC committee’s 
primary general recommendation is for 
DOE to consider moving over time to 
use of a full-fuel-cycle measure of 
energy consumption for assessment of 
national and environmental impacts, 
especially levels of greenhouse gas 
emissions, and to providing more 
comprehensive information to the

public through labels and other means, 
such as an enhanced Web site. For those 
appliances that use multiple fuels (e.g., 
water heaters), the NRC committee 
believes that measuring full-fuel-cycle 
energy consumption would provide a 
more complete picture of energy used, 
thereby allowing comparison across 
many different appliances as well as an 
improved assessment of impacts. The 
NRC committee also acknowledged the 
complexities inherent in developing a 
full-fuel-cycle measure of energy use 
and stated that a majority of the 
committee recommended a gradual 
transition to that expanded measure and 
eventual replacement of the currently 
used extended site measure. 
DOE acknowledges that its site-to- 
source conversion factors do not capture 
all of the energy consumed in 
extracting, processing, and transporting 
primary fuels. DOE also agrees with the 
NRC committee’s conclusion that 
developing site-to-source conversion 
factors that capture the energy 
associated with the extraction, 
processing, and transportation of 
primary fuels is inherently complex and 
difficult. However, DOE has performed 
some preliminary evaluation of a full- 
fuel-cycle measure of energy use. 
Based on two studies completed by 
the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL) in 1999 and 2000, 
DOE estimated the ratio of the energy 
used upstream to the energy content of 
the coal or natural gas delivered to 
power plants. For coal, the NREL 
analysis considered typical mining 
practices and mine-to-plant 
transportation distances, and used data 
for the State of Illinois. Based on data 
in this report, the estimated 
multiplicative factor for coal is 1.08 (i.e., 
it takes approximately 1.08 units of coal 
energy equivalent to provide 1 unit of 
coal to a power plant). A similar 
analysis of the energy consumed in 
upstream processes needed to produce 
and deliver natural gas to a power plant 
yielded a multiplicative factor of 1.19. 
(For further information on the NREL 
studies, please see: Spath, Pamela L., 
Margaret K. Mann, and Dawn Kerr, Life 
Cycle Assessment of Coal-fired Power 
Production, NREL/TP–570–25119, June 
1999; and Spath, Pamela L. and 
Margaret K. Mann, Life Cycle 
Assessment of a Natural Gas Combined- 
Cycle Power Generation System, NREL/ 
TP–570–27715, September 2000.) 
While the above factors are indicative 
of the magnitude of the impacts of using 
full-fuel-cycle measures of energy use, 
there are two aspects of the problem that 
warrant further study. The first is the 
refinement of the estimates of the 
multiplicative factors, particularly to 
incorporate regional variation. The 
second is development of forecasts of 
the multiplicative factors over the time 
frames used in the rulemaking analyses, 
typically ten to fifty years. The second 
issue, of forecasting how the efficiency 
factors for various fuels may change 
over time, has the potential to be quite 
significant. The existing NEMS forecast 
of power plant electricity generation by 
fuel type can be used to estimate the 
impact of a changing mix of fuels. 
However, currently NEMS provides no 
information on potential changes to the 
relative ease with which the different 
fuels can be extracted and processed. 
DOE intends to further evaluate the 
viability of using full-fuel-cycle 
measures of energy consumption for 
assessment of national and 
environmental impacts of appliance 
standards. 
e. Total Installed Costs and Operating 
Costs 
The total annual installed cost 
increase is equal to the annual 
difference in the per-unit total installed 
cost between the base case and 
standards cases multiplied by the 
shipments forecasted in the standards 
case. 
The annual operating cost savings per 
unit reflect differences in energy, repair, 
and maintenance costs between the base 
case and the various standard levels 
DOE considered. DOE forecasted energy 
prices for the preliminary analysis are 
based on AEO2008. DOE updated the 
energy prices for today’s proposed rule 
using forecasts from AEO2009. 
f. Discount Rates 
DOE multiplies monetary values in 
future years by the discount factor to 
determine the present value. For the 
preliminary analysis and today’s NOPR, 
DOE estimated the NPV of appliance 
consumer benefits using both a 3- 
percent and a 7-percent real discount 
rate. DOE uses these discount rates in 
accordance with guidance provided by 
the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) to Federal agencies on the 
development of regulatory analysis 
(OMB Circular A–4 (Sept. 17, 2003), 
section E, ‘‘Identifying and Measuring 
Benefits and Costs’’). NRDC stated that 
a discount rate below 3 percent is 
warranted for societal benefits. (NRDC, 
No. 48 at p. 5) OMB Circular A–4 states 
that when regulation primarily and 
directly affects private consumption, a 
lower discount rate is appropriate. ‘‘The 
alternative most often used is sometimes 
called the social rate of time preference 
* * * the rate at which ‘society’ 
discounts future consumption flows to 
their present value.’’ (p. 33) It suggests 
that the real rate of return on long-term 
government debt may provide a fair 
approximation of the social rate of time 
preference, and states that over the last 
30 years, this rate has averaged around 
3 percent in real terms on a pre-tax 
basis. It concludes that ‘‘for regulatory 
analysis, [agencies] should provide 
estimates of net benefits using both 3 
percent and 7 percent.’’ (p. 34) DOE 
finds that the guidance from OMB is 
reasonable, so it is continuing to use a 
3-percent and a 7-percent discount rate 
for estimating net benefits. 
3. Other Inputs 
a. Effects of Standards on Energy Prices 
In the preliminary analysis, DOE 
analyzed the potential impact on natural 
gas prices resulting from amended 
standards on water heaters and the 
associated benefits for all natural gas 
consumers in all sectors of the economy. 
(DOE did not include natural gas 
savings from amended standards on 
DHE and pool heaters in this analysis 
because they are not large enough to 
have a noticeable impact.) DOE used 
NEMS–BT to account for the natural gas 
savings associated with two scenarios of 
possible standards, including max-tech 
efficiency levels. Like other widely used 
energy-economic models, NEMS 
incorporates parameters to estimate the 
changes in energy prices that would 
result from an increase or decrease in 
energy demand. The response of price to 
a decrease in demand is termed the 
‘‘inverse price elasticity.’’ The overall 
inverse price elasticity observed in 
NEMS changes over the forecast period 
based on the model’s dynamics of 
natural gas supply and demand. DOE 
calculated the nominal savings in total 
natural gas expenditures in each year by 
multiplying the estimated annual 
change in the average end-user natural 
gas price by the annual total U.S. 
natural gas consumption associated 
with each scenario. DOE then calculated 
the NPV of the savings in natural gas 
expenditures for 2015 to 2045 using 3- 
and 7-percent discount rates for each 
scenario. 
For the NOPR, DOE used the same 
approach to estimate the benefits of 
reduced natural gas prices as in the 
preliminary TSD. However, it analyzed 
the potential impact on natural gas 
prices, and the associated benefits for 
natural gas consumers, resulting from 
the proposed water heater standards 
(TSL 4), as well as the other TSLs 
considered. 
NRDC stated that DOE must consider 
the benefit of reduced natural gas and 
electricity prices and include it in the 
NIA. (NRDC, No. 48 at p. 5) ACEEE

65915 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
stated that DOE must incorporate the 
impacts of gas and electricity 
consumption reductions resulting from 
the standards on energy prices in the 
primary economic analysis, rather than 
simply note side studies that DOE did 
not incorporate into the decision- 
making process. (ACEEE, No. 35 at p. 8) 
DOE reports the results of its analysis 
of the benefits of reduced natural gas 
prices associated with standards in 
chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD, National 
Impacts Analysis. As discussed therein, 
when gas prices drop in response to a 
lower output of existing natural gas 
production capacity, consumers benefit 
but producers suffer. In economic terms, 
the situation represents a benefits 
transfer to consumers (whose 
expenditures fall) from producers 
(whose revenue falls equally). When 
prices decrease because extraction costs 
decline, however, consumers and 
producers both benefit, and the change 
in natural gas prices represents a net 
gain to society. Consumers benefit from 
the lower prices, and producers, whose 
revenues and costs both fall, are no 
worse off. Because there is uncertainty 
about the extent to which the calculated 
impacts from reduced natural gas prices 
are a benefits transfer, DOE tentatively 
concluded that it should not give a 
heavy weight to this factor in its 
consideration of the economic 
justification of standards on heating 
products. 
DOE investigated the possibility of 
estimating the impact of specific 
standard levels on electricity prices in 
its rulemaking for general service 
fluorescent lamps and incandescent 
reflector lamps. (See U.S. Department of 
Energy—Office of Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy: Energy Conservation 
Standards for General Service 
Fluorescent Lamps and Incandescent 
Reflector Lamps; Proposed Rule, 74 FR 
16920, 16978–979 (April 13, 2009).) It 
found that whereas natural gas markets 
exhibit a fairly simple chain of agents 
from producers to consumers, the 
electric power industry is a complex 
mix of fuel suppliers, producers, and 
distributors. While the distribution of 
electricity is regulated everywhere, its 
institutional structure varies, and 
upstream components are more 
complicated, because the cost of 
generation differs across the country. 
For these and other reasons, accurate 
modeling of the response of electricity 
prices to a decrease in residential-sector 
demand due to standards is 
problematic. Thus, DOE does not plan 
to estimate the value of potentially 
reduced electricity costs for all 
consumers associated with revised 
standards for heating products. 
G. Consumer Subgroup Analysis 
In analyzing the potential impact of 
new or amended standards on 
individual and commercial consumers, 
DOE evaluates the impact on 
identifiable subgroups of consumers 
that may be disproportionately affected 
by a national standard level. DOE used 
RECS data to analyze the potential effect 
of energy conservation standards on the 
considered consumer subgroups for 
selected heating products, as explained 
below. For gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters, and gas wall fan and gas 
wall gravity DHE, DOE estimated 
consumer subgroup impacts for low- 
income households and senior-only 
households. In addition, for gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters, DOE 
estimated consumer subgroup impacts 
for households in multi-family housing 
and households in manufactured homes 
as well. 
DOE did not evaluate consumer 
subgroup impacts for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters and oil- 
fired storage water heaters. Gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters were 
excluded from the consumer subgroup 
analysis due to insufficient data, and 
oil-fired storage water heaters were 
excluded due to low product shipments. 
For direct heating equipment, gas floor 
DHE and gas room DHE were excluded 
due to the low and decreasing levels of 
product shipments. For gas hearth DHE, 
DOE examined the senior-only 
subgroup, but did not evaluate the low- 
income subgroup because the saturation 
of this product is very small among low- 
income households due to the high 
product cost. DOE did not evaluate 
consumer subgroup impacts for pool 
heaters because the sample size of the 
subgroups is too small for meaningful 
analysis. More details on the consumer 
subgroup analysis and results can be 
found in chapter 11 of the NOPR TSD. 
H. Manufacturer Impact Analysis 
1. Overview 
In determining whether an amended 
energy conservation standard for the 
three types of heating products subject 
to this rulemaking is economically 
justified, the Secretary is required to 
consider ‘‘the economic impact of the 
standard on the manufacturers and on 
the consumers of the products subject to 
such standard.’’ (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(I)) The statute also calls 
for an assessment of the impact of any 
lessening of competition as determined 
by the Attorney General that is likely to 
result from the adoption of a standard. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V)) DOE 
conducted the MIA to estimate the 
financial impact of amended energy 
conservation standards on 
manufacturers of residential water 
heaters, DHE, and pool heaters, and to 
assess the impacts of such standards on 
employment and manufacturing 
capacity. 
The MIA has both quantitative and 
qualitative aspects. The quantitative 
part of the MIA relies on the 
Government Regulatory Impact Model 
(GRIM), an industry cash-flow model 
customized for the three heating 
products covered in this rulemaking. 
The GRIM inputs characterize each 
industry’s cost structure, shipments, 
and revenues. This includes information 
from many of the analyses described 
above, such as MPCs and MSPs from the 
engineering analysis and shipment 
forecasts from the NIA. The key GRIM 
output is the Industry Net Present Value 
(INPV), which estimates the value of 
each industry on the basis of cash flows, 
expenditures, and investment 
requirements as a function of TSLs. 
Different sets of assumptions (scenarios) 
will produce different results. The 
qualitative part of the MIA addresses 
factors such as product characteristics, 
characteristics of particular firms, and 
market trends. The qualitative 
discussion also includes an assessment 
of the impacts of standards on 
manufacturer subgroups. The complete 
MIA is discussed in chapter 12 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
DOE conducted the MIA for the three 
types of heating products in three 
phases. Phase 1 (Industry Profile) 
characterized each industry using data 
on market shares, sales volumes and 
trends, pricing, employment, and 
financial structure. Phase 2 (Industry 
Cash Flow) focused on each industry as 
a whole. In this phase, DOE used each 
GRIM to prepare an industry cash-flow 
analysis. Using publicly-available 
information developed in Phase 1, DOE 
adapted each GRIM’s generic structure 
to perform an analysis of the impacts on 
residential water heater, directing 
heating equipment, and pool heater 
manufacturers due to amended energy 
conservation standards. In Phase 3 
(Subgroup Impact Analysis), DOE 
conducted interviews with a 
representative cross-section of 
manufacturers that produce the majority 
of residential water heater, DHE, and 
pool heater sales. During these 
interviews, DOE discussed engineering, 
manufacturing, procurement, and 
financial topics specific to each 
company, and obtained each 
manufacturer’s view of the industry as 
a whole. The interviews also provided 
valuable information that DOE used to 
evaluate the impacts of amended energy 
conservation standard on manufacturer

cash flows, manufacturing capacity, and 
employment levels. Each of these 
phases is discussed in further detail 
below. 
a. Phase 1: Industry Profile 
In Phase 1 of the MIA, DOE prepared 
a profile of each of the three heating 
product industries based on the market 
and technology assessment prepared for 
this rulemaking. Before initiating the 
detailed impact studies, DOE collected 
information on the present and past 
structure and market characteristics of 
each industry. This information 
included market share data, product 
shipments, manufacturer markups, and 
the cost structure for various 
manufacturers. The industry profile 
includes: (1) Further detail on the 
overall market and product 
characteristics; (2) estimated 
manufacturer market shares; (3) 
financial parameters such as net plant, 
property, and equipment, SG&A 
expenses, cost of goods sold, etc.; and 
(4) trends in the number of firms, 
market, and product characteristics for 
the three heating product industries. 
The industry profile included a top- 
down cost analysis of residential water 
heater, DHE, and pool heater 
manufacturers that DOE used to derive 
preliminary financial inputs for the 
GRIMs (e.g., revenues, depreciation, 
SG&A, and research and development 
(R&D) expenses). DOE also used public 
sources of information to further 
calibrate its initial characterization of 
each industry, including Security and 
Exchange Commission 10–K filings 
(available at http://www.sec.gov), 
Standard & Poor’s stock reports 
(available at http:// 
www2.standardandpoors.com), and 
corporate annual reports. DOE 
supplemented this public information 
with data released by privately held 
companies. 
b. Phase 2: Industry Cash-Flow Analysis 
Phase 2 focused on the financial 
impacts of potential amended energy 
conservation standards on industries as 
a whole. More-stringent energy 
conservation standards can affect 
manufacturer cash flow in three distinct 
ways: (1) Create a need for increased 
investment, (2) raise production costs 
per unit, and (3) alter revenue due to 
higher per-unit prices and possible 
changes in sales volumes. To quantify 
these impacts in Phase 2 of the MIA, 
DOE used the GRIMs to perform three 
cash-flow analyses: one for the 
residential water heater industry 
(separated into the impacts on gas-fired 
and electric storage, oil-fired storage, 
and gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters), one for DHE (separated into the 
impacts on traditional DHE and gas 
hearth DHE), and one for gas-fired pool 
heaters. In performing these analyses, 
DOE used the financial values derived 
during Phase 1 and the shipment 
scenarios used in the NIA. 
c. Phase 3: Subgroup Impact Analysis 
Using average cost assumptions to 
develop an industry-cash-flow estimate 
does not adequately assess differential 
impacts of amended energy 
conservation standards among 
manufacturer subgroups. For example, 
small manufacturers, niche players, or 
manufacturers exhibiting a cost 
structure that largely differs from the 
industry average could be more 
negatively affected. DOE used the 
results of the industry characterization 
analysis in Phase 1 to group 
manufacturers that exhibit similar 
characteristics. The interviews provided 
valuable information on manufacturer 
subgroups. During the manufacturer 
interviews, DOE discussed financial 
topics specific to each manufacturer and 
obtained each manufacturer’s view of 
the industry as a whole. 
As stated above, DOE reports the MIA 
impacts by grouping the impacts of 
certain product classes together. DOE 
presents the industry impacts by the 
major product types (gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters, oil-fired 
storage water heaters, gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, traditional 
DHE, gas hearth DHE, and gas-fired pool 
heaters). These product groupings 
represent separate markets that are 
served by the same manufacturers and 
are typically produced in the same 
factories. Once segmented into major 
product types by industry, DOE was 
only able to identify one subgroup— 
small manufacturers. 
For its small business manufacturer 
subgroup analysis, DOE uses the small 
business size standards published by 
the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) to determine whether a company 
is a ‘‘small business.’’ 65 FR 30836, 
30848 (May 15, 2000), as amended at 65 
FR 53533, 53544 (Sept. 5, 2000) and 
codified at 13 CFR Part 121). To be 
categorized as a ‘‘small business,’’ a 
residential water heater, DHE, or pool 
heater manufacturer and its affiliates 
may employ a maximum of 500 
employees. The 500-employee threshold 
includes all employees in a business’s 
parent company and any other 
subsidiaries. Based upon this 
classification, DOE identified five 
residential water heater manufacturers, 
12 DHE manufacturers, and one small 
gas-fired pool heater manufacturer that 
qualify as small businesses per the 
applicable SBA definition. The small 
business subgroup is discussed in 
chapter 12 of the TSD and in section 
VI.B of today’s notice. 
2. GRIM Analysis 
DOE uses the GRIM to quantify the 
changes in cash flow that result in a 
higher or lower industry value. The 
GRIM analysis uses a standard, annual- 
cash-flow analysis that incorporates 
MPCs, MSPs, shipments, and industry 
financial information as inputs, and 
models changes in costs, distribution of 
shipments, product and capital 
conversion costs, and manufacturer 
markups that would result from 
amended energy conservation 
standards. The GRIM spreadsheet uses 
the inputs to arrive at a series of annual 
cash flows, beginning with the base year 
of the analysis, 2010, and continuing 
over the analysis period. DOE used the 
same base year (2010) as the NIA, which 
is the same year as the announcement 
of the final rule. DOE used the same 
analysis period in the MIA as in the 
NIA. For all rulemakings, DOE 
considers a 30-year analysis period after 
the anticipated compliance date of the 
final rule, which under EPCA means the 
date after which regulated parties must 
comply with the requirements of the 
amended standard. The compliance date 
of the rulemaking is estimated to be 
March of 2013 for DHE and pool heaters 
and March of 2015 for residential water 
heaters. The analysis period runs from 
the beginning of 2013 to 2043 for DHE 
and pool heaters and from the beginning 
of 2015 to 2045 for residential water 
heaters. 
DOE uses the GRIM to calculate cash 
flows using standard accounting 
principles and to compare changes in 
INPV between the base case and various 
TSLs (the standards cases). The 
difference in INPV between the base 
case and the standards case represents 
the financial impact of the potential 
amended energy conservation standard 
on manufacturers. DOE collected this 
information from a number of sources, 
including publicly-available data and 
manufacturer interviews. 
DOE created a separate GRIM for each 
of the three types of heating products. 
For today’s notice, DOE is structuring 
separate TSLs for the three heating 
products. DOE also treats certain 
product classes within the three heating 
products separately. For example, DOE 
created specialized interview guides for 
different groups of product classes. 
These interview guides included one for 
storage water heaters (gas-fired storage, 
electric storage, and oil-fired storage 
water heaters), one for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, one for

traditional DHE (gas wall fan, gas wall 
gravity, gas floor, and gas room DHE), 
one for gas hearth DHE, and one for gas- 
fired pool heaters. DOE grouped product 
classes made by the same manufacturers 
and in the same production facilities 
together. This allowed DOE to better 
understand the impacts on 
manufacturers of these product classes. 
For example, the TSLs DOE 
considered for residential water heater 
packages selected efficiency levels of 
gas-fired storage, electric storage, oil- 
fired storage, and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. The TSLs 
DOE considered for DHE packages 
selected efficiency levels for gas wall 
fan, gas wall gravity, gas floor, gas room, 
and gas hearth units. Each of the TSLs 
DOE considered for pool heaters consist 
of a single efficiency level for gas-fired 
pool heaters. DOE describes the TSLs in 
section V.A of today’s notice. Because 
the combinations of TSLs can make it 
more difficult to discuss the required 
efficiencies for each product class, DOE 
presents the MIA results in section 
V.B.2 of today’s notice and chapter 12 
of the NOPR TSD by groups of 
manufacturers that make the covered 
products. DOE presents the MIA results 
for gas-fired storage and electric storage 
water heaters together because 
manufacturers typically produce both 
types of water heaters in the same 
facilities. The MIA results for oil-fired 
storage and gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters are presented separately. 
The MIA results for DHE are separated 
into traditional DHE (gas wall fan, gas 
wall gravity, gas floor, and gas room 
DHE) and gas hearth DHE. The MIA 
results for gas-fired pool heaters are also 
presented separately. 
a. GRIM Key Inputs 
i. Manufacturer Product Costs 
In the MIA, DOE used the MPCs for 
the three types of heating products at 
each efficiency level calculated in the 
engineering analysis, as described in 
section IV.C and further detailed in 
chapter 5 of the NOPR TSD. Changes in 
MPCs can affect revenues and gross 
margins. For instance, manufacturing a 
higher-efficiency product is typically 
more expensive due to the use of more 
complex components and higher-cost 
raw materials. For gas-fired storage 
water heaters, DOE used a weighted 
average MPC using both standard burner 
and ultra-low-NOX burner cost- 
efficiency curves from the engineering 
analysis to account for shipments of 
ultra-low-NOX water heaters. 
ii. Base-Case Shipments Forecast 
The GRIM estimates manufacturer 
revenues based on total unit shipment 
forecasts and the distribution of these 
values by efficiency level. Changes in 
the efficiency mix at each standard level 
affect manufacturer finances. For this 
analysis, the GRIM uses the NIA 
shipments forecasts from 2008 and 
continuing until the end of the analysis 
period for each heating product (2045 
for residential water heaters and 2043 
for DHE and pool heaters). In the 
shipments analysis, DOE also estimated 
the distribution of efficiencies in the 
base case for all product classes. See 
section IV.F.1 for additional details. 
iii. Product and Capital Conversion 
Costs 
Amended energy conservation 
standards will cause manufacturers to 
incur one-time conversion costs to bring 
their production facilities and product 
designs into compliance. For the MIA, 
DOE classified these one-time 
conversion costs into two major groups: 
(1) Product conversion costs and (2) 
capital conversion costs. Product 
conversion costs are one-time 
investments in research, development, 
testing, marketing, and other costs 
focused on making product designs 
comply with the amended energy 
conservation standard. Capital 
conversion costs are one-time 
investments in property, plant, and 
equipment to adapt or change existing 
production facilities so that new 
product designs can be fabricated and 
assembled. 
DOE assessed the product conversion 
costs manufacturers would be required 
to make at each TSL. For residential gas- 
fired storage water heaters, electric 
storage water heaters, and gas-fired pool 
heaters, DOE based most of its estimates 
of the product conversion costs on 
information obtained from manufacturer 
interviews. DOE estimated average 
industry product conversion costs by 
weighting the estimates from 
manufacturers by market share, then 
extrapolating the interviewed 
manufacturers’ product conversion costs 
for each product class to account for the 
market share of companies that were not 
interviewed. DOE verified the accuracy 
of these product conversion costs by 
comparing them to its own estimate of 
the product development, testing, 
certification, and retraining effort 
required by each manufacturer at each 
TSL. DOE also compared the product 
conversion costs to the total cost of 
other recent product development 
efforts manufacturers have incurred 
(such as the cost to redesign burners to 
comply with ultra-low-NOX 
requirements). For gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters at TSL 5, DOE 
used the industry-wide product 
conversion costs for the standard-size 
volumes at TSL 4. DOE assumed the 
additional product conversion costs for 
the large gallon sizes at TSL 5 scaled 
with the total industry-wide product 
conversion costs. At TSL 5 for gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters, DOE 
multiplied its estimate for the entire 
industry to exclusively offer heat pump 
products at TSL 6 and condensing 
products at TSL 7 by the percentage of 
total electric storage and gas-fired 
storage water heater models that exceed 
a 55 gallon rated volume (27 percent 
and 11 percent, respectively). 
For oil-fired storage water heaters, 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters, 
and all DHE product classes, DOE did 
not receive sufficient manufacturer data 
to serve as the basis for its industry- 
wide product conversion estimates. For 
these products, DOE calculated its 
estimates by reviewing product 
literature and publically-available 
information about the efficiency of the 
existing product lines. DOE used this 
information to estimate the number of 
product lines that manufacturers would 
need to modify or develop at each TSL. 
DOE also estimated a per-product-line 
development cost at each efficiency 
level and assumed these costs 
represented the product conversion 
costs for a manufacturer that has to 
upgrade product lines to meet that TSL. 
DOE also assumed that that the product 
development costs increase as the 
design changes become more complex 
and if manufacturers do not currently 
offer products that meet or exceed the 
required efficiency. DOE calculated the 
product conversion costs by multiplying 
its per-line product conversion cost 
estimate by the number of product lines 
that manufacturers would need to 
modify or develop at each TSL. For 
traditional DHE and gas-fired water 
heaters, DOE assumed that 
manufacturers would convert all 
existing product lines that did not meet 
the efficiencies required at that TSL. 
However, for gas hearth DHE DOE 
assumed that manufacturers would only 
convert up to 50-percent of their 
existing product lines that did not meet 
the required efficiencies. DOE’s 
estimates of the product conversion 
costs for all of the heating products 
addressed in this rulemaking can be 
found in section V.B.2 of today’s notice 
and in chapter 12 of the NOPR TSD. 
DOE also evaluated the level of 
capital conversion costs manufacturers 
would incur to comply with potential 
amended energy conservation

standards. During interviews, DOE 
asked manufacturers to estimate the 
required capital conversion costs to 
expand the production of higher- 
efficiency products or quantify the 
required tooling and plant changes if 
product lines meeting the required 
efficiency level do not exist. For 
residential gas-fired storage water 
heaters, electric storage water heaters, 
and gas-fired pool heaters, DOE based 
its capital conversion costs for most 
TSLs on these interviews. DOE verified 
the accuracy of these capital conversion 
costs by comparing them to a separate 
bottoms-up estimate of the number of 
sub-assembly and assembly lines for 
each manufacturer and the required 
tooling changes to each line at each 
TSL, considering the costs of recent line 
upgrades. As a final verification, DOE 
examined what level of capital 
investments would be required to 
maintain the historical value for net 
plant, property, and equipment as a 
ratio of total revenue. For gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters at TSL 5, 
DOE used the industry-wide capital 
conversion costs for the standard-size 
volumes at TSL 4. At TSL 5 DOE also 
used a separate estimate to calculate the 
additional capital conversion costs that 
would be required to manufacture gas- 
fired condensing water heaters and 
electric heat pump water heaters for 
rated storage volumes above 55 gallons. 
For oil-fired storage water heaters, gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters, and 
DHE, DOE used a bottoms-up approach 
to estimate the cost of additional 
production equipment and changes to 
existing production lines that the 
industry would require at each TSL. 
DOE used feedback from manufacturer 
interviews about the tooling 
requirements at each efficiency level 
and product catalogs to estimate the 
total capital conversion costs for each 
product category at each TSL. 
DOE did not consider the provisions 
in the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, Public Law 
111–5, in its estimates of the capital 
conversion costs for all products. The 
industrial development bonds and 
advanced energy project tax credit 
programs in that Act have not been fully 
distributed, and there is insufficient 
information available to do a thorough 
analysis of their potential impacts. It is 
also unclear if manufacturers of 
residential water heaters, DHE, or pool 
heaters would qualify for these 
provisions. DOE is not aware of any 
manufacturers of products covered by 
this rulemaking being awarded funds 
from these programs (see http:// 
www.energy.gov/recovery/ for a list of 
awardees). Therefore, DOE did not 
include the bonds or tax credit in its 
analysis for this NOPR of potential 
impacts on the three heating product 
industries. DOE’s estimates of the 
capital conversion costs for all three 
types of heating products can be found 
in section V.B.2 of today’s notice and in 
chapter 12 of the NOPR TSD. 
b. GRIM Scenarios 
i. Residential Water Heater Standards- 
Case Shipments Forecasts 
The GRIM used several residential 
water heater shipments developed in 
the NIA. The NIA incorporated different 
scenarios that account for fuel 
switching, penetration rates of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, growth 
rates of ENERGY STAR products, and 
economic growth rates. To account for 
the likely impacts on the water heater 
industry of amended energy 
conservation standards, DOE used the 
main NIA shipment scenario. The main 
NIA water heater scenario accounted for 
fuel switching. In this scenario, DOE 
considered the potential for current 
users of electric storage water heaters to 
instead purchase a gas-fired storage 
water heater replacement if amended 
energy conservation standard for 
electric storage water heaters were set at 
levels that would effectively require the 
use of heat pumps. The main NIA 
scenario used the Reference case gas- 
fired instantaneous water heater market 
share scenario. Finally, the main NIA 
scenario used the Reference case 
economic growth scenario and the 
moderate rate of efficiency growth 
scenarios. In all standards-case 
shipment scenarios, DOE considered 
that shipments at efficiencies below the 
projected minimum standard levels 
would roll up to those efficiency levels 
in response to amended energy 
conservation standards. See section 
IV.F.1 of this NOPR and chapter 10 for 
more information on the residential 
water heater standards-case shipment 
scenarios. 
ii. Direct Heating Equipment and Pool 
Heater Shipment Scenarios 
For the DHE and pool heater 
shipments, DOE used the NIA 
shipments in the base case and the 
standards case. DOE also considered 
that shipments at efficiencies below the 
projected minimum standard levels in 
the base case would roll up to those 
efficiency levels in response to amended 
energy conservation standards. See 
section IV.F.1 of this NOPR and chapter 
10 of the NOPR TSD for additional 
details about the shipment scenarios. 
iii. Markup Scenarios 
In the GRIM, DOE used the MSPs 
estimated in the engineering analysis for 
each product class and efficiency level. 
The MSPs include direct manufacturing 
production costs (i.e., labor, material, 
and overhead estimated in DOE’s 
MPCs), all non-production costs (i.e., 
SG&A, R&D, shipping, and interest), 
along with profit. 
DOE used several standards-case 
markup scenarios to represent the 
uncertainty about the potential impacts 
on prices and profitability following the 
implementation of amended energy 
conservation standards. For the three 
types of heating products, DOE analyzed 
two markup scenarios: (1) a preservation 
of return on invested capital scenario, 
and (2) a preservation of operating profit 
scenario. 
Return on invested capital is defined 
as net operating profit after taxes 
divided by the total invested capital 
(fixed assets and working capital, or net 
plant, property, and equipment plus 
working capital). In the preservation of 
return on invested capital scenario, the 
manufacturer markups are set so that 
the return on invested capital the year 
after the compliance date of the 
amended energy conservation standards 
is the same as in the base case. This 
scenario models the situation in which 
manufacturers maintain a similar level 
of profitability from the investments 
required by amended energy 
conservation standards as they do from 
their current business operations. After 
standards, manufacturers have higher 
net operating profits but also greater 
working capital and investment 
requirements. Because manufacturers 
earn additional operating profit from the 
investments required by the amended 
energy conservation standards, this 
scenario represents the high bound to 
profitability following standards. 
During interviews, multiple 
manufacturers stated that the higher 
production costs could severely harm 
profitability. Because of the highly 
competitive market, several 
manufacturers suggested that the 
additional costs required at higher 
efficiencies could not be fully passed 
through to customers. In the 
preservation of operating profit markup 
scenario, manufacturer markups are 
lowered so that only the total operating 
profit in absolute dollars is maintained 
as before the amended energy 
conservation standard. DOE 
implemented this scenario in GRIM by 
lowering the manufacturer markups at 
each TSL to yield approximately the 
same earnings before interest and taxes 
in the standards case in the year after

the compliance date of the amended 
standards, as in the base case. This 
scenario represents the lower bound of 
industry profitability following 
amended energy conservation standards 
because higher production costs and the 
investments required to comply with 
the amended energy conservation 
standard do not yield additional 
operating profit. 
3. Discussion of Comments 
During the February 2009 public 
meeting, interested parties commented 
on the assumptions and results of the 
preliminary analysis. In oral and written 
comments, interested parties discussed 
the effects of the current economic 
downturn on manufacturers, the high 
costs required to educate installers and 
service contractors, and potential 
employment impacts due to amended 
energy conservation standards. DOE 
addresses these comments below. DOE 
also received comments on the 
cumulative burden of ultra-low-NOX 
requirements, which are addressed in 
sections IV.C and V.B.2.f. 
a. Responses to General Comments 
AHRI stated that DOE must take into 
account the impacts of the current 
economic conditions on the 
manufacturing industry in the 
manufacturer impact analysis. (AHRI, 
Public Meeting Transcript, No. 34.4 at 
p. 19) 
In the MIA, DOE models the impacts 
of amended energy conservation 
standards on manufacturers of 
residential water heaters, DHE, and pool 
heaters from the base year to the end of 
the analysis period (i.e., 2010–2045 for 
residential water heaters and 2010–2043 
for DHE and pool heaters). DOE notes 
the compliance dates for all three 
heating products (i.e., 2015 for 
residential water heaters and 2013 for 
DHE and pool heaters). Using 
information that only reflects these 
three industries during the current 
economic downturn would not be 
representative of the three heating 
products over the entire analysis period. 
DOE used the most current information 
that is publicly available in many of its 
estimates and analyses, inputs that take 
the current economic downturn into 
consideration. For example, as 
described in section IV.C.4.b, DOE uses 
5-year averages for metal material prices 
and up-to-date prices for other raw 
materials and purchased components in 
its engineering analysis cost models. For 
today’s notice, DOE also updated many 
of its LCC and NIA assumptions to 
better reflect the most recent 
information (e.g., AEO2009) and in 
response to comments from interested 
parties (sections IV.E and IV.F). For the 
MIA, DOE uses financial parameters like 
standard R&D to model the cash-flow 
impacts on the water heater, DHE, and 
pool heater industries. To calculate the 
estimates of the financial parameters 
used in the GRIMs, DOE examined 6 
years of SEC 10–K data. While DOE 
updated some of these GRIM estimates 
based on interviews with 
manufacturers, these changes were 
made to better reflect the parameters 
that are representative of each industry 
over the long-term and are not 
specifically attributable to current 
economic conditions. 
b. Water Heater Comments 
BWC and AHRI stated that the 
economic downturn has limited the 
funding available for R&D and the 
tooling necessary to develop and 
manufacture more-efficient products. 
(BWC, No. 46 at p. 3; AHRI, No. 33 at 
p. 1) Noritz America Corporation also 
stated that the economy has greatly 
affected manufacturers’ bottom line and 
ability to support R&D. (Noritz, No. 36 
at p. 3) 
For today’s notice, DOE includes the 
capital and product conversion costs 
that would be required to meet the 
entire industry demand at each TSL. 
While DOE agrees that the current 
economic downturn may affect the 
funding for R&D and capital 
expenditures in the near term, DOE 
notes that the compliance date for the 
residential water heater standard is 
2015. In the GRIM, DOE allocates its 
estimates of the product conversion and 
capital conversion costs in between the 
announcement of the final rule adopting 
energy conservation standard (estimated 
to be March 2010) and the compliance 
date requiring compliance with the 
energy conservation standards for water 
heaters. DOE also assumes that more of 
the capital conversion and product 
conversion costs will occur closer to the 
compliance date than the 
announcement date. Because most of 
the product conversion and capital 
conversion costs are allocated several 
years in the future, it is expected that 
the economic conditions at that time 
will be different than they are currently. 
BWC argued that as new technologies 
are developed, manufacturers must 
incur additional costs to educate 
installers and service contractors. (BWC, 
No. 46 at p. 3) 
DOE agrees with BWC that a higher 
energy conservation standard could 
require manufacturers to incur costs to 
educate installers and service 
contractors, especially if the products 
have to change dramatically to 
accommodate amended energy 
conservation standards. During 
interviews, manufacturers indicated that 
significant resources are required to 
educate installers and service 
contractors when a new product is 
introduced. The resources required are 
even greater when the new product 
involves a new technology or a new 
mode of operation. For example, an 
energy conservation standard that 
eliminates atmospheric gas-fired storage 
water heaters would have such an 
impact on manufacturers. Product 
conversion costs are one-time 
investments which encompass research, 
development, testing, and marketing, 
focused on making product designs 
comply with the amended energy 
conservation standard. Hence, DOE 
includes an estimate of the cost to 
manufacturers to educate installers and 
service contractors in the product 
conversion costs at each TSL. 
Bock asserted that the ENERGY STAR 
program will affect consumer 
purchasing patterns. Bock commented 
that ENERGY STAR, which ignored oil- 
fired storage water heaters, caused a loss 
of market share, a reduction in 
shipments, and a decrease in 
employment for oil-fired storage water 
heater manufacturers. (Bock, No. 53 at 
p. 3) 
DOE agrees that a reduction in oil- 
fired storage water heater shipments 
could affect employment at oil-fired 
manufacturers’ plants. However, DOE 
does not believe that the proposed 
energy conservation standard will cause 
a reduction in oil-fired storage water 
heater shipments. For example, today’s 
proposed energy conservation standards 
increase the installed price of electric 
storage water heaters, gas storage water 
heaters, and instantaneous gas-fired 
water heaters by roughly $132, $101, 
and $588, respectively over the current 
baseline products. The installed cost of 
an oil-fired storage water heater 
increases by only $61. DOE does not 
believe that these minimum price 
increases for consumers would distort 
the market such that consumers would 
elect to replace oil-fired storage water 
heaters with another type of water 
heater. DOE addresses the direct 
employment impacts due to standards 
in section V.B.2.d. 
4. Manufacturer Interviews 
DOE interviewed manufacturers 
representing over 95 percent of 
residential storage water heater sales, 
about 50 percent of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater sales, 
approximately 99 percent of traditional 
DHE sales (gas wall fan, gas wall gravity, 
gas floor, and gas room DHE), over 50 
percent of gas hearth DHE sales, and

about 75 percent of pool heater sales. 
These interviews were beyond those 
DOE conducted as part of the 
engineering analysis. DOE used these 
interviews to tailor each GRIM to 
incorporate unique financial 
characteristics for each industry. DOE 
contacted companies from its database 
of manufacturers, which provided a 
representative sample of each industry. 
All interviews provided information 
that DOE used to evaluate the impacts 
of potential amended energy 
conservation standards on manufacturer 
cash flows, manufacturing capacities, 
and employment levels. 
Before each telephone interview or 
site visit, DOE provided company 
representatives with an interview guide 
that included the topics for which DOE 
sought input. The MIA interview topics 
included: (1) Key issues to this 
rulemaking; (2) a company overview 
and organizational characteristics; (3) 
manufacturer production costs and 
selling prices; (4) manufacturer markups 
and profitability; (5) shipment 
projections and market shares; (6) 
product mix; (7) financial parameters; 
(8) conversion costs; (9) cumulative 
regulatory burden; (10) direct 
employment impact assessment; (11) 
exports, foreign competition, and 
outsourcing; (12) consolidation; and (13) 
impacts on small business. The MIA 
interview guide for storage water heaters 
contained three additional sections: (1) 
Ultra-low-NOX water heaters; (2) unit 
shipping methods and associated costs; 
and (3) alternative energy efficiency 
equations. Appendix 12A of the NOPR 
TSD contains the five interview guides 
DOE used to conduct the MIA 
interviews. 
In the manufacturer interviews, DOE 
asked manufacturers to describe their 
major concerns about this rulemaking. 
The following sections describe the 
most significant key issues identified by 
manufacturers. DOE also includes 
additional concerns in chapter 12 of the 
TSD. DOE’s responses are provided 
where relevant in today’s notice. 
a. Storage Water Heater Key Issues 
i. Fuel Switching 
Gas-fired storage, electric storage, and 
oil-fired storage water heater 
manufacturers are concerned that this 
energy conservation standard 
rulemaking could cause fuel switching. 
While most storage water heater 
manufacturers also sell gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, storage 
manufacturers are concerned that a 
more aggressive standard on gas-fired 
and electric storage units could lower 
the first cost differential of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters and 
increase their market penetration. 
Increased penetration of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters would 
lower the shipments of storage water 
heaters, resulting in lower profitability 
and fewer shipments for manufacturers 
that focus on storage water heaters, 
especially if they lose market share to 
companies that exclusively manufacture 
instantaneous water heaters. 
ii. Ultra-Low-NOX Requirements 
Manufacturers that make gas-fired 
storage water heaters are concerned 
about the large product development 
costs to meet the ultra-low-NOX 
requirements in some regions of the 
Southwest. In particular, manufacturers 
are concerned that higher energy factors, 
lower NOX emissions, and compliance 
with existing safety regulations are often 
at odds. Manufacturers also stated that 
the higher cost of the ultra-low-NOX gas 
storage water heaters would hurt 
consumers in those regions and could 
cause them to switch to less expensive 
electric storage units. 
iii. Profitability 
Manufacturers stated that amended 
energy conservations standards could 
affect profitability. At any TSL, 
manufacturers will be forced to 
discontinue a certain percentage of their 
existing products and make potentially 
significant product and plant 
modifications. If manufacturers earn a 
lower markup for more-efficient 
products after the amended energy 
conservation standard, their profit 
margin would decrease. Energy 
conservation standards could also harm 
profitability by eliminating up-sell 
opportunities to more-efficient units 
that earn a greater absolute profit. 
Finally, while manufacturers generally 
agree with DOE’s estimate of 
manufacturer production costs, many 
noted that their actual product offerings 
are more segmented into multiple 
models made at various production 
locations. Multiple product offerings 
could make it more difficult to reach the 
price points DOE calculates. If 
production costs were higher, markups 
would be lower than the manufacturer 
markup DOE assumes and profitability 
would decrease. 
iv. Appropriateness of Heat Pump Water 
Heaters 
Heat pump water heaters are 
effectively required for all rated storage 
volumes at TSL 6 and TSL 7 and for a 
portion of the market at TSL 5 for 
electric storage water heaters to meet the 
specified efficiency level. Most electric 
storage water heater manufacturers 
disagreed with DOE’s decision to 
include heat pump water heaters in the 
electric storage water heater product 
class. In addition, all electric storage 
water heater manufacturers agreed that 
this technology is only appropriate for 
the ENERGY STAR level, not a 
minimum required efficiency. While 
many manufacturers intend to or 
currently are designing heat pump water 
heaters in response to the ENERGY 
STAR requirements, manufacturers 
believe that setting a minimum standard 
during the design phase is not 
appropriate and could cause many 
serious and negative consequences. 
Manufacturers listed many reasons 
why this technology is not ready to be 
applied across the millions of electric 
storage water heaters needed to satisfy 
demand. A significant problem is that 
heat pump water heaters could not be 
installed in a large portion of existing 
homes (e.g., 30 to 40 percent of homes), 
without incurring tremendous costs for 
affected consumers to modify their 
existing structures. The technology also 
has not been fully developed and has 
not yet been proven reliable for large- 
scale manufacturing. Some 
manufacturers are concerned that any 
problems that arise with applying the 
technology across millions of electric 
storage water heaters that could not be 
proven by the compliance date of the 
rule would cause significant harm to 
their industry due to the anti- 
backsliding provision in EPCA. 
Manufacturers stated that other 
problems could arise with the 
production of heat pump water heaters 
if the standard were set at TSL 6 or TSL 
7. For example, there is almost no 
existing capacity to manufacture these 
water heaters, especially on the scale 
that an energy conservation standard 
would require. Requiring over 4 million 
annual shipments in 2015 could lead to 
acquisition problems because 
component suppliers are not prepared 
for such a jump in demand. In 
particular, acquiring sufficient 
compressors, thermal expansion valves, 
and other purchased parts to meet 
market demand could be a challenge. 
Manufacturers also added that setting 
the energy conservation standard at a 
level effectively requiring the use of 
heat pump technology would cause 
many negative impacts in the industry, 
even if the technology were proven by 
the compliance date specified in the 
final rule. Because of the increased labor 
required, manufacturers would have to 
consider shifting a considerable portion 
of production overseas to obtain viable 
production costs, as was true for the 
residential air-conditioning industry. 
Domestic employment in the industry

would be affected because only part of 
the production would likely remain in 
the United States after the compliance 
date of the amended energy 
conservation standard. 
Manufacturers also stated that they 
would incur significant conversion costs 
if the standard level effectively 
mandates heat pump water heaters, for 
the reasons explained below. Every 
main assembly line and feeder line 
would need modifications to integrate 
the new assembly into existing 
production facilities. Finally, 
manufacturers would face a significant 
challenge to retrain their service 
technicians and installers for a 
completely new technology. Because the 
technology has not been fully 
developed, the skills needed to service 
and install heat pump water heaters are 
unknown. However, manufacturers 
indicated that a combination of 
plumbing and HVAC skills would be 
required that do not exist today. 
v. Capital Conversion Costs for Oil-Fired 
Storage Water Heaters 
Oil-fired storage water heater 
manufacturers indicated that capital 
conversion costs for oil-fired storage 
water heaters at higher efficiency levels, 
while perhaps not appearing 
prohibitively large on a nominal basis, 
are extremely significant relative to the 
volume of oil-fired water heater 
shipments. At any level above TSL 1, at 
least one manufacturer with substantial 
market share indicated that there is a 
real risk that these capital and product 
conversion costs could cause it to exit 
the market. 
b. Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water Heater 
Key Issues 
i. Potential Market Distortion 
Manufacturers stated that amended 
energy conservation standard could 
greatly affect the market penetration of 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters. If 
the prices were greatly increased 
relative to storage water heaters, market 
penetration could be slowed. In 
addition, a drastic increase in the 
required efficiency (at TSL 7) could 
disrupt current arrangements with 
overseas suppliers or parent companies 
and limit product availability in the 
United States. 
ii. Ultra-Low-NOX Requirements 
Manufacturers of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters expressed 
great concern about the conflicting 
requirements of higher energy factor 
requirements and pending ultra-low- 
NOX requirements. At most efficiency 
levels, manufacturers commented that 
there is a tradeoff in burner design 
between higher efficiency and lower 
NOX emissions. Manufacturers 
indicated that they have not found a 
solution and are very concerned about 
concurrently meeting the ultra-low-NOX 
requirements and amended energy 
conservation standards. 
c. Direct Heating Equipment Key Issues 
(Gas Wall Fan, Gas Wall Gravity, Gas 
Floor, and Gas Room Direct Heating 
Equipment) 
i. Consumer Impacts 
Manufacturers remarked that energy 
conservation standards could hurt 
consumers, arguing that many of 
existing installations cannot be replaced 
with more-efficient units because of 
space considerations. Customers that 
choose these units would either have to 
pay for structural modifications or 
switch to a different heat source. Some 
manufacturers also noted that 
improvements in efficiency for the most 
common type of traditional DHE (gas 
wall gravity DHE) have long paybacks at 
any TSL. 
All manufacturers stated that gas wall 
gravity and gas room DHE provide a 
unique utility by operating in the event 
of a power failure. Manufacturers stated 
that consumers would be hurt if these 
products required line power, because it 
would leave many without a backup 
source of heat. 
ii. Significant Capital and Product 
Development Costs 
Manufacturers stated that any product 
conversion or capital conversion cost 
would be difficult to justify because of 
the very low shipment volumes of each 
product line. Manufacturers remarked 
that any required investments could 
force them to reduce their product 
offerings at best and permanently exit 
the market at worst. Due to the large 
number of product offerings that would 
need to be recertified and/or redesigned, 
some manufacturers argued that 3 years 
would not be enough lead time. Finally, 
because shipment volumes are so low, 
any investment would significantly add 
to the final cost of the product, 
assuming that manufacturers could pass 
part of the increased cost on to 
consumers. 
Manufacturers are also concerned that 
higher production costs could drive 
more consumers to purchase a central 
system rather than replace their failed 
direct heating system. If shipments 
declined at all, manufacturers stated 
they would be less able to justify the 
required investment to upgrade 
products and product lines, which 
would hurt their industry further. All 
manufacturers said that potential energy 
conservation standards are a real threat 
to their business and could cause them 
to exit the market completely. 
d. Direct Heating Equipment Key Issues 
(Gas Hearth Direct Heating Equipment) 
i. Loss of Aesthetic Appeal for 
Decorative Products 
According to manufacturers, all gas 
hearth products have an aesthetic 
function in addition to a heating 
function. In fact, manufacturers stated 
that the primary function of most gas 
hearth products covered by this 
rulemaking is the ambiance and 
aesthetic appeal provided by the flame. 
Gas hearth DHE are used mostly to zone 
heat when occupants are in close 
proximity or to supplement a central 
heating system, but are used as a 
primary heating source only in very rare 
cases. 
Because gas hearth DHE are mostly 
decorative items in residences, 
manufacturers believe that energy 
conservation standards could have a 
different impact on their industry than 
the water heater industry, for example. 
Gas hearth manufacturers stated that the 
utility of the other strictly heating 
products covered by today’s rule has 
little to do with the appearance of the 
products and would not be impacted at 
any standard level. For example, the 
consumer utility from water heaters 
would not be impacted by amended 
energy conservation standards as long as 
hot water is still delivered. However, 
the relevant manufacturers were greatly 
concerned that potential energy 
conversation standards for gas hearth 
DHE could harm their industry and 
consumers in qualitative ways, in 
addition to the direct impacts on 
industry value. Their customers’ needs 
are related to the size, shape, and 
appearance of the flame, and for these 
customers, efficiency is not usually a 
concern, given such products’ low usage 
patterns. Manufacturers stated that they 
earn premiums for aesthetic features 
such as better-looking flames and more 
attractive masonry, rather than higher 
efficiency. Multiple manufacturers 
stated that the yellow flames that 
consumers look for in a log set depend 
on a rich gas-to-air mixture, which 
inherently limits the achievable energy 
efficiency. Hence, at higher efficiency 
levels, it becomes more difficult to 
improve efficiency and maintain a 
desirable flame color, an impact that is 
hard to measure and which could have 
a significant detrimental effect on the 
industry.

ii. Product Switching and Profitability 
Because the aesthetic appeal of the 
unit and the flame are critical features, 
manufacturers believed that overly- 
stringent energy conservation standards 
could cause customers to switch to non- 
covered hearth products, such as wood- 
burning stoves or strictly decorative 
units, if the energy conservation 
standards greatly raised prices. Finally, 
manufacturers stated that a significant 
portion of gas hearth products are 
purchased by builders. Because the 
appearance of the units and the flame 
are more critical features than 
efficiency, manufacturers believed that 
higher costs could cause more builders 
to purchase strictly decorative products 
that are not covered by this rulemaking. 
Besides higher prices potentially 
causing a switching to non-covered 
products, manufacturers were also 
concerned that higher standards had the 
potential to lower overall demand for 
gas hearth products. At higher costs, 
manufacturers believe that customers 
would no longer purchase inserts for 
existing homes or that builders would 
make gas hearth products in new homes 
an option rather than a standard feature. 
Manufacturers also believe that a 
shrinking market would reduce profits. 
e. Pool Heater Key Issues 
i. Impacts on Consumers 
Manufacturers stated that an amended 
energy conservation standards set above 
an efficiency level achievable using 
atmospheric technology (TSL 3 through 
TSL 6) could hurt consumers. 
According to manufacturers, customers 
would not recoup the initial higher 
costs with lower utility bills at these 
TSLs. Because most residential pool 
heaters are a luxury item with low usage 
patterns, most customers do not 
purchase units at TSL 4 and above. 
Thus, manufacturers stated that more- 
efficient residential pool heaters are 
only appropriate in commercial settings 
(e.g., hotels, gyms) because the higher 
usage allows such customers to recoup 
the higher initial costs. 
ii. Future Shipment Trends 
Manufacturers commented that pool 
heater shipments follow new housing 
starts. Because the new housing market 
is down, manufacturers have lowered 
their projections for future pool heater 
sales as well. Manufacturers also do not 
expect future shipments to return to 
historical levels, as recent new housing 
starts have increasingly been on smaller 
lots that do not have the room to 
accommodate swimming pools. 
Manufacturers are concerned that 
amended energy conservation standards 
could further decrease future sales. 
Because pool heaters are not a necessity, 
the higher initial cost could dissuade 
some consumers from replacing a failed 
unit or adding a heater to a new pool or 
spa. Manufacturers are also concerned 
that a higher price point for gas-fired 
pool heaters could hurt future 
shipments by making alternatives like 
solar or heat pump pool heaters 
comparatively cheaper. Manufacturers 
stated that this trend is already a 
concern because a few States and 
utilities have offered subsidies for solar 
water heaters. 
iii. Future NOX Emission Requirements 
According to manufacturers, 
residential gas-fired pool heaters are 
currently exempt from ultra-low NOX 
requirements in the Southwest air 
quality management districts. However, 
most manufacturers voiced a concern 
over potential future requirements. If air 
quality management districts set more 
restrictive NOX requirements in the 
future, some manufacturers may be 
required to incur a costly redesign of 
their burner systems. 
I. Employment Impact Analysis 
Employment impacts consist of direct 
and indirect impacts. Direct 
employment impacts are any changes in 
the number of employees of 
manufacturers of the appliance products 
that are the subject of this rulemaking, 
their suppliers, and related service 
firms. Indirect employment impacts are 
changes in employment in the larger 
economy that occur due to the shift in 
expenditures and capital investment 
caused by the purchase and operation of 
more-efficient appliances. The MIA 
addresses the direct employment 
impacts that concern manufacturers of 
the three heating products. 
Indirect employment impacts from 
standards consist of the net jobs created 
or eliminated in the national economy, 
other than in the manufacturing sector 
being regulated, due to: (1) Reduced 
spending by end users on energy 
(electricity, gas—including liquefied 
petroleum gas—and oil); (2) reduced 
spending on new energy supply by the 
utility industry; (3) increased spending 
on new products to which the new 
standards apply; and (4) the effects of 
those three factors throughout the 
economy. DOE expects the net monetary 
savings from standards to be redirected 
to other forms of economic activity. 
DOE also expects these shifts in 
spending and economic activity to affect 
the demand for labor in the short term, 
as explained below. 
One method for assessing the possible 
effects on the demand for labor of such 
shifts in economic activity is to compare 
sectoral employment statistics 
developed by the Labor Department’s 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). (Data 
on industry employment, hours, labor 
compensation, value of production, and 
the implicit price deflator for output for 
these industries are available upon 
request by calling the Division of 
Industry Productivity Studies (202–691– 
5618) or by sending a request by e-mail 
to dipsweb@bls.gov. See http:// 
www.bls.gov/news.release/ 
prin1.nr0.htm.) The BLS regularly 
publishes its estimates of the number of 
jobs per million dollars of economic 
activity in different sectors of the 
economy, as well as the jobs created 
elsewhere in the economy by this same 
economic activity. Data from BLS 
indicate that expenditures in the utility 
sector generally create fewer jobs (both 
directly and indirectly) than 
expenditures in other sectors of the 
economy. There are many reasons for 
these differences, including wage 
differences and the fact that the utility 
sector is more capital intensive and less 
labor intensive than other sectors. See 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional 
Multipliers: A User Handbook for the 
Regional Input-Output Modeling System 
(RIMS II), U.S. Department of 
Commerce, 1992. 
Energy conservation standards have 
the effect of reducing consumer utility 
bills. Because reduced consumer 
expenditures for energy likely lead to 
increased expenditures in other sectors 
of the economy, the general effect of 
efficiency standards is to shift economic 
activity from a less labor-intensive 
sector (i.e., the utility sector) to more 
labor-intensive sectors (e.g., the retail 
and manufacturing sectors). 
In developing the preliminary 
analysis and today’s NOPR, DOE 
estimated indirect national employment 
impacts using an input/output model of 
the U.S. economy called Impact of 
Sector Energy Technologies (ImSET). 
ImSET is a spreadsheet model of the 
U.S. economy that focuses on 188 
sectors most relevant to industrial, 
commercial, and residential building 
energy use. (See J. M. Roop, M. J. Scott, 
and R. W. Schultz, ImSET: Impact of 
Sector Energy Technologies, PNNL– 
15273, Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory, 2005). ImSET is a special- 
purpose version of the ‘‘U.S. Benchmark 
National Input-Output’’ (I–O) model 
designed to estimate the national 
employment and income effects of 
energy-saving technologies. The ImSET 
software includes a computer-based I–O 
model with structural coefficients to 
characterize economic flows among the 
188 sectors. ImSET’s national economic

I–O structure is based on a 1997 U.S. 
benchmark table (See Lawson, Ann M., 
et al., ‘‘Benchmark Input-Output 
Accounts of the U.S. Economy, 1997,’’ 
Survey of Current Business, Dec. 2002, 
pp. 19–117.) Chapter 13 of the NOPR 
TSD presents further details on the 
employment impact analysis. 
J. Utility Impact Analysis 
The utility impact analysis included 
an analysis of the potential effects of 
amended energy conservation standards 
for the three types of heating products 
on the electric and gas utility industries. 
For this analysis, DOE used NEMS–BT 
to generate forecasts of electricity and 
natural gas consumption, electricity 
generation by plant type, and electric 
generating capacity by plant type. DOE 
conducts the utility impact analysis as 
a scenario that departs from the latest 
AEO Reference case. In other words, the 
energy savings impacts from amended 
energy conservation standards are 
modeled using NEMS–BT to generate 
forecasts that deviate from the AEO 
Reference case. Chapter 13 of the NOPR 
TSD presents details on the utility 
impact analysis. 
NEEA and NPCC urged DOE to 
consider the impact of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters on local gas 
distribution companies’ ability to meet 
hot water demand during peak periods, 
and the possibility that they may have 
to invest in shoring up system peak 
capacity, adding significant upward 
pressure on rates. (NEEA and NPCC, No. 
42 at p. 9) DOE acknowledges that 
growing use of gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters could contribute to peak 
demand problems, and that higher- 
efficiency gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters could ameliorate the problem. 
However, DOE currently does not have 
adequate data to reliably quantify the 
potential impacts. 
K. Environmental Analysis 
DOE has prepared a draft 
environmental assessment (EA) 
pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act and the requirements of 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI) and 6316(a) 
to determine the environmental impacts 
of the proposed standards. DOE 
estimated the impacts on power sector 
emissions of CO2, NOX, and Hg using 
the NEMS–BT model. Because the on- 
site operation of non-electric heating 
products requires use of fossil fuels and 
results in emissions of CO2, NOX and 
sulfur dioxide (SO2), DOE also 
accounted for the reduction in these 
emissions due to standards at the sites 
where these appliances are used. 
1. Impacts of Standards on Emissions 
In the EA, NEMS–BT is run similarly 
to the AEO NEMS, except that heating 
product energy use is reduced by the 
amount of energy saved (by fuel type) 
due to each TSL. The inputs of national 
energy savings come from the NIA 
spreadsheet model; the output is the 
forecasted physical emissions at each 
TSL. The net benefit of the standard is 
the difference between emissions 
estimated by NEMS–BT at each TSL and 
the AEO Reference Case. 
NEMS–BT tracks CO2 emissions using 
a detailed module that provides results 
with broad coverage of all sectors and 
inclusion of interactive effects. For the 
preliminary TSD, DOE used AEO2008. 
For today’s NOPR, DOE used the 
AEO2009 NEMS (stimulus version). For 
the final rule, DOE intends to revise the 
emissions analysis using the most 
current AEO. 
DOE has preliminarily determined 
that SO2 emissions from affected 
Electric Generating Units (EGUs) are 
subject to nationwide and regional 
emissions cap and trading programs that 
create uncertainty about the standards’ 
impact on SO2 emissions. Title IV of the 
Clean Air Act sets an annual emissions 
cap on SO2 for all affected EGUs. SO2 
emissions from 28 eastern States and the 
District of Columbia (D.C.) are also 
limited under the Clean Air Interstate 
Rule (CAIR, published in the Federal 
Register on May 12, 2005. 70 FR 25162 
(May 12, 2005), which creates an 
allowance-based trading program that 
will gradually replace the Title IV 
program in those States and DC. (The 
recent legal history surrounding CAIR is 
discussed below.) The attainment of the 
emissions caps is flexible among EGUs 
and is enforced through the use of 
emissions allowances and tradable 
permits. Energy conservation standards 
could lead EGUs to trade allowances 
and increase SO2 emissions that offset 
some or all SO2 emissions reductions 
attributable to the standard. DOE is not 
certain that there will be reduced 
overall SO2 emissions from the 
standards. The NEMS–BT modeling 
system that DOE used to forecast 
emissions reductions currently indicates 
that no physical reductions in power 
sector emissions would occur for SO2. 
The above considerations prevent DOE 
from estimating SO2 reductions from 
standards at this time. 
Even though DOE is not certain that 
there will be reduced overall emissions 
from the standard, there may be an 
economic benefit from reduced demand 
for SO2 emission allowances. Electricity 
savings decrease the generation of SO2 
emissions from power production, 
which can lessen the need to purchase 
SO2 emissions allowance credits, and 
thereby decrease the costs of complying 
with regulatory caps on emissions. 
Much like SO2, NOX emissions from 
28 eastern States and the District of 
Columbia (DC) are limited under the 
CAIR. Although CAIR has been 
remanded to EPA by the D.C. Circuit, it 
will remain in effect until it is replaced 
by a rule consistent with the Court’s 
July 11, 2008, opinion in North Carolina 
v. EPA. 531 F.3d 896 (D.C. Cir. 2008); 
see also North Carolina v. EPA, 550 F.3d 
1176 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Because all States 
covered by CAIR opted to reduce NOX 
emissions through participation in cap- 
and-trade programs for electric 
generating units, emissions from these 
sources are capped across the CAIR 
region. 
In the 28 eastern States and DC where 
CAIR is in effect, DOE’s forecasts 
indicate that no NOX emissions 
reductions will occur because of the 
permanent cap. Energy conservation 
standards have the potential to produce 
environmentally-related economic 
impact in the form of lower prices for 
emissions allowance credits, if they 
were large enough. However, DOE has 
preliminarily concluded that the 
proposed standard would not have such 
an effect because the estimated 
reduction in NOX emissions or the 
corresponding allowance credits in 
States covered by the CAIR cap would 
be too small to affect allowance prices 
for NOX under the CAIR. 
The proposed standard would reduce 
NOX emissions in those 22 States not 
affected by the CAIR. As a result, DOE 
used the NEMS–BT to forecast emission 
reductions from the standards that are 
considered in today’s NOPR. 
Similar to emissions of SO2 and NOX, 
future emissions of Hg would have been 
subject to emissions caps. The Clean Air 
Mercury Rule (CAMR) would have 
permanently capped emissions of 
mercury for new and existing coal-fired 
plants in all States beginning in 2010 
(70 FR 28606). However, the CAMR was 
vacated by the D.C. Circuit in its 
decision in New Jersey v. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 517 F 3d 574 (D.C. 
Cir. 2008) Thus, DOE was able to use 
the NEMS–BT model to estimate the 
changes in Hg emissions resulting from 
the proposed rule. 
EEI stated that DOE’s analysis of 
emissions from electric power 
generation should account for the rise in 
renewable portfolio standards and the 
possibility of an upcoming CO2 cap and 
trade program, both of which would 
reduce the amount of emissions 
produced per kWh electricity generated.

of CO2 emissions from electric power 
generation are based on the AEO2009 
version of NEMS. The emissions 
projections reflect market factors and 
policies that affect utility choice of 
power plants for electricity generation, 
including existing renewable portfolio 
standards. Because of the speculative 
nature of forecasting future regulations, 
DOE does not include the impact of 
possible future regulations in its 
forecasts. 
EEI stated that if DOE examines 
changes in power plant emissions, then 
it should also examine changes in the 
emissions associated with oil extraction 
(domestic and overseas), crude oil 
transportation (sea and land-based), 
natural gas flaring, oil refining, refined 
oil delivery, natural gas production, 
natural gas delivery, natural gas delivery 
system methane leaks, propane 
production and delivery, and emissions 
associated with the extraction and 
importation of liquefied natural gas. 
(EEI, No. 40 at p. 6) 
Emissions occur at each stage of the 
extraction, conversion, and delivery of 
the energy supply chain. Nonetheless, 
emissions are dominated by power plant 
emissions in the case of electric 
appliances and in-house emissions in 
the case of natural gas and oil-fired 
appliances, so DOE focuses on those 
points. 
The operation of non-electric heating 
products requires use of fossil fuels and 
results in emissions of CO2, NOX and 
SO2 at the sites where these appliances 
are used. NEMS–BT provides no means 
for estimating such emissions. DOE 
calculated the effect of the proposed 
standards on the above site emissions 
based on emissions factors derived from 
the literature. 
2. Valuation of CO2 Emissions 
Reductions 
DOE received comments on the 
desirability of valuing the CO2 
emissions reductions that result from 
standards. NRDC stated that DOE must 
account for the value of avoided carbon 
emissions. (NRDC, No. 48 at p. 4) NEEA 
and NPCC stated that it would be 
inappropriate to assign a value of zero 
to avoided carbon emissions. (NEEA 
and NPCC, No. 42 at p. 10) Earthjustice 
stated that DOE must consider well- 
established literature on the value of 
CO2 emissions to consider reduced 
emissions in States that will remain 
outside CO2 reduction regimes. 
(Earthjustice, No. 47 at p. 4) 
For today’s NOPR, DOE is relying on 
a new set of values recently developed 
by an interagency process that 
conducted a thorough review of existing 
estimates of the social cost of carbon 
(SCC). The SCC is intended to be a 
monetary measure of the incremental 
damage resulting from greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, including, but not 
limited to, net agricultural productivity 
loss, human health effects, property 
damages from sea level rise, and 
changes in ecosystem services. Any 
effort to quantify and to monetize the 
harms associated with climate change 
will raise serious questions of science, 
economics, and ethics. But with full 
regard for the limits of both 
quantification and monetization, the 
SCC can be used to provide estimates of 
the social benefits of reductions in GHG 
emissions. 
For at least three reasons, any single 
estimate of the SCC will be contestable. 
First, scientific and economic 
knowledge about the impacts of climate 
change continues to grow. With new 
and better information about relevant 
questions, including the cost, burdens, 
and possibility of adaptation, current 
estimates will inevitably change over 
time. Second, some of the likely and 
potential damages from climate 
change—for example, the value society 
places on adverse impacts on 
endangered species—are not included 
in all of the existing economic analyses. 
These omissions may turn out to be 
significant in the sense that they may 
mean that the best current estimates are 
too low. Third, controversial ethical 
judgments, including those involving 
the treatment of future generations, play 
a role in judgments about the SCC (see 
in particular the discussion of the 
discount rate, below). 
To date, regulations have used a range 
of values for the SCC. For example, a 
regulation proposed by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) in 
2008 assumed a value of $7 per ton CO2 
(2006$) for 2011 emission reductions 
(with a range of $0–14 for sensitivity 
analysis). Regulation finalized by DOE 
used a range of $0–$20 (2007$). Both of 
these ranges were designed to reflect the 
value of damages to the United States 
resulting from carbon emissions, or the 
‘‘domestic’’ SCC. In the final Model 
Year 2011 Corporate Average Fuel 
Economy rule, DOT used both a 
domestic SCC value of $2/t CO2 and a 
global SCC value of $33/t CO2 (with 
sensitivity analysis at $80/tCO2), 
increasing at 2.4 percent per year 
thereafter. 
In recent months, a variety of agencies 
have worked to develop an objective 
methodology for selecting a range of 
interim SCC estimates to use in 
regulatory analyses until improved SCC 
estimates are developed. The following 
summary reflects the initial results of 
these efforts and proposes ranges and 
values for interim social costs of carbon 
used in this rule. It should be 
emphasized that the analysis described 
below is preliminary. These complex 
issues are of course undergoing a 
process of continuing review. Relevant 
agencies will be evaluating and seeking 
comment on all of the scientific, 
economic, and ethical issues before 
establishing final estimates for use in 
future rulemakings. 
The interim judgments resulting from 
the recent interagency review process 
can be summarized as follows: (a) DOE 
and other Federal agencies should 
consider the global benefits associated 
with the reductions of CO2 emissions 
resulting from efficiency standards and 
other similar rulemakings, rather 
continuing the previous focus on 
domestic benefits; (b) these global 
benefits should be based on SCC 
estimates (in 2007$) of $55, $33, $19, 
$10, and $5 per ton of CO2 equivalent 
emitted (or avoided) in 2007 (in 
calculating the benefits reported in this 
NOPR, DOE has escalated the 2007$ 
values to 2008$ for consistency with 
other dollar values presented in this 
notice, resulting in SCC estimates (in 
2008$) of approximately $5, $10, $20, 
$34, and $56); (c) the SCC value of 
emissions that occur (or are avoided) in 
future years should be escalated using 
an annual growth rate of 3 percent from 
the current values); and (d) domestic 
benefits are estimated to be 
approximately 6 percent of the global 
values. These interim judgments are 
based on the following considerations. 
1. Global and domestic estimates of 
SCC. Because of the distinctive nature of 
the climate change problem, estimates 
of both global and domestic SCC values 
should be considered, but the global 
measure should be ‘‘primary.’’ This 
approach represents a departure from 
past practices, which relied, for the 
most part, on measures of only domestic 
impacts. As a matter of law, both global 
and domestic values are permissible; the 
relevant statutory provisions are 
ambiguous and allow the agency to 
choose either measure. (It is true that 
Federal statutes are presumed not to 
have extraterritorial effect, in part to 
ensure that the laws of the United States 
respect the interests of foreign 
sovereigns. But use of a global measure 
for the SCC does not give extraterritorial 
effect to Federal law and hence does not 
intrude on such interests.) 
It is true that under OMB guidance, 
analysis from the domestic perspective 
is required, while analysis from the 
international perspective is optional. 
The domestic decisions of one nation 
are not typically based on a judgment 
about the effects of those decisions on

other nations. But the climate change 
problem is highly unusual in the sense 
that it involves (a) a global public good 
in which (b) the emissions of one nation 
may inflict significant damages on other 
nations and (c) the United States is 
actively engaged in promoting an 
international agreement to reduce 
worldwide emissions. 
In these circumstances, the global 
measure is preferred. Use of a global 
measure reflects the reality of the 
problem and is expected to contribute to 
the continuing efforts of the United 
States to ensure that emission 
reductions occur in many nations. 
Domestic SCC values are also 
presented. The development of a 
domestic SCC is greatly complicated by 
the relatively few region- or country- 
specific estimates of the SCC in the 
literature. One potential estimate comes 
from the DICE (Dynamic Integrated 
Climate Economy, William Nordhaus) 
model. In an unpublished paper, 
Nordhaus (2007) produced 
disaggregated SCC estimates using a 
regional version of the DICE model. He 
reported a U.S. estimate of $1/tCO2 
(2007 value, 2007$), which is roughly 
11 percent of the global value. 
An alternative source of estimates 
comes from a recent EPA modeling 
effort using the FUND (Climate 
Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation 
and Distribution, Center for Integrated 
Study of the Human Dimensions of 
Global Change) model. The resulting 
estimates suggest that the ratio of 
domestic to global benefits varies with 
key parameter assumptions. With a 3 
percent discount rate, for example, the 
US benefit is about 6 percent of the 
global benefit for the ‘‘central’’ (mean) 
FUND results, while, for the 
corresponding ‘‘high’’ estimates 
associated with a higher climate 
sensitivity and lower global economic 
growth, the US benefit is less than 4 
percent of the global benefit. With a 2 
percent discount rate, the U.S. share is 
about 2 to 5 percent of the global 
estimate. 
Based on this available evidence, a 
domestic SCC value equal to 6 percent 
of the global damages is used in this 
rulemaking. This figure is in the middle 
of the range of available estimates from 
the literature. It is recognized that the 6 
percent figure is approximate and 
highly speculative and alternative 
approaches will be explored before 
establishing final values for future 
rulemakings. 
2. Filtering existing analyses. There 
are numerous SCC estimates in the 
existing literature, and it is legitimate to 
make use of those estimates to produce 
a figure for current use. A reasonable 
starting point is provided by the meta- 
analysis in Richard Tol, ‘‘The Social 
Cost of Carbon: Trends, Outliers, and 
Catastrophes, Economics: The Open- 
Access, Open-Assessment E–Journal,’’ 
Vol. 2, 2008–25. http://www.economics- 
ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/ 
2008-25 (2008). With that starting point, 
it is proposed to ‘‘filter’’ existing SCC 
estimates by using those that (1) are 
derived from peer-reviewed studies; (2) 
do not weight the monetized damages to 
one country more than those in other 
countries; (3) use a ‘‘business as usual’’ 
climate scenario; and (4) are based on 
the most recent published version of 
each of the three major integrated 
assessment models (IAMs): FUND, DICE 
and PAGE (Policy Analysis of the 
Greenhouse Effect). 
Proposal (1) is based on the view that 
those studies that have been subject to 
peer review are more likely to be 
reliable than those that have not been. 
Proposal (2) is based on a principle of 
neutrality and simplicity; it does not 
treat the citizens of one nation 
differently on the basis of speculative or 
controversial considerations. Proposal 
(3) stems from the judgment that as a 
general rule, the proper way to assess a 
policy decision is by comparing the 
implementation of the policy against a 
counterfactual state where the policy is 
not implemented. A departure from this 
approach would be to consider a more 
dynamic setting in which other 
countries might implement policies to 
reduce GHG emissions at an unknown 
future date, and the United States could 
choose to implement such a policy now 
or in the future. 
Proposal (4) is based on three 
complementary judgments. First, the 
FUND, PAGE, and DICE models now 
stand as the most comprehensive and 
reliable efforts to measure the damages 
from climate change. Second, the latest 
versions of the three IAMs are likely to 
reflect the most recent evidence and 
learning, and hence they are presumed 
to be superior to those that preceded 
them. It is acknowledged that earlier 
versions may contain information that is 
missing from the latest versions. Third, 
any effort to choose among them, or to 
reject one in favor of the others, would 
be difficult to defend at this time. In the 
absence of a clear reason to choose 
among them, it is reasonable to base the 
SCC on all of them. 
The agency is keenly aware that the 
current IAMs fail to include all relevant 
information about the likely impacts 
from greenhouse gas emissions. For 
example, ecosystem impacts, including 
species loss, do not appear to be 
included in at least two of the models. 
Some human health impacts, including 
increases in food-borne illnesses and in 
the quantity and toxicity of airborne 
allergens, also appear to be excluded. In 
addition, there has been considerable 
recent discussion of the risk of 
catastrophe and of how best to account 
for worst-case scenarios. It is not clear 
whether the three IAMs take adequate 
account of these potential effects. 
3. Use a model-weighted average of 
the estimates at each discount rate. At 
this time, there appears to be no 
scientifically valid reason to prefer any 
of the three major IAMs (FUND, PAGE, 
and DICE). Consequently, the estimates 
are based on an equal weighting of 
estimates from each of the models. 
Among estimates that remain after 
applying the filter, the average of all 
estimates within a model is derived. 
The estimated SCC is then calculated as 
the average of the three model-specific 
averages. This approach ensures that the 
interim estimate is not biased towards 
specific models or more prolific authors. 
4. Apply a 3 percent annual growth 
rate to the chosen SCC values. SCC is 
assumed to increase over time, because 
future emissions are expected to 
produce larger incremental damages as 
physical and economic systems become 
more stressed as the magnitude of 
climate change increases. Indeed, an 
implied growth rate in the SCC is 
produced by most studies that estimate 
economic damages caused by increased 
GHG emissions in future years. But 
neither the rate itself nor the 
information necessary to derive its 
implied value is commonly reported. In 
light of the limited amount of debate 
thus far about the appropriate growth 
rate of the SCC, applying a rate of 3 
percent per year seems appropriate at 
this stage. This value is consistent with 
the range recommended by IPCC (2007) 
and close to the latest published 
estimate (Hope, 2008). 
For climate change, one of the most 
complex issues involves the appropriate 
discount rate. OMB’s current guidance 
offers a detailed discussion of the 
relevant issues and calls for discount 
rates of 3 percent and 7 percent. It also 
permits a sensitivity analysis with low 
rates for intergenerational problems. (‘‘If 
your rule will have important 
intergenerational benefits or costs you 
might consider a further sensitivity 
analysis using a lower but positive 
discount rate in addition to calculating 
net benefits using discount rates of 3 
and 7 percent.’’) The SCC is being 
developed within the general context of 
the current guidance. 
The choice of a discount rate, 
especially over long periods of time, 
raises highly contested and exceedingly 
difficult questions of science,

economics, philosophy, and law. See, 
e.g., William Nordhaus, ‘‘The Challenge 
of Global Warming (2008); Nicholas 
Stern, The Economics of Climate 
Change’’ (2007); ‘‘Discounting and 
Intergenerational Equity’’ (Paul Portney 
and John Weyant, eds., 1999). Under 
imaginable assumptions, decisions 
based on cost-benefit analysis with high 
discount rates might harm future 
generations—at least if investments are 
not made for the benefit of those 
generations. See Robert Lind, ‘‘Analysis 
for Intergenerational Discounting,’’ id. at 
173, 176–177. At the same time, use of 
low discount rates for particular projects 
might itself harm future generations, by 
ensuring that resources are not used in 
a way that would greatly benefit them. 
In the context of climate change, 
questions of intergenerational equity are 
especially important. 
Reasonable arguments support the use 
of a 3 percent discount rate. First, that 
rate is among the two figures suggested 
by OMB guidance, and hence it fits with 
existing National policy. Second, it is 
standard to base the discount rate on the 
compensation that people receive for 
delaying consumption, and the 3 
percent rate is close to the risk-free rate 
of return, proxied by the return on long 
term inflation-adjusted U.S. Treasury 
Bonds. (In the context of climate 
change, it is possible to object to this 
standard method for deriving the 
discount rate.) Although these rates are 
currently closer to 2.5 percent, the use 
of 3 percent provides an adjustment for 
the liquidity premium that is reflected 
in these bonds’ returns. 
At the same time, other arguments 
support use of a 5 percent discount rate. 
First, that rate can also be justified by 
reference to the level of compensation 
for delaying consumption, because it fits 
with market behavior with respect to 
individuals’ willingness to trade off 
consumption across periods as 
measured by the estimated post-tax 
average real returns to private 
investment (e.g., the S&P 500). In the 
climate setting, the 5 percent discount 
rate may be preferable to the riskless 
rate because it is based on risky 
investments and the return to projects to 
mitigate climate change is also risky. In 
contrast, the 3 percent riskless rate may 
be a more appropriate discount rate for 
projects where the return is known with 
a high degree of confidence (e.g., 
highway guardrails). 
Second, 5 percent, and not 3 percent, 
is roughly consistent with estimates 
implied by reasonable inputs to the 
theoretically derived Ramsey equation, 
which specifies the optimal time path 
for consumption. That equation 
specifies the optimal discount rate as 
the sum of two components. The first 
reflects the fact that consumption in the 
future is likely to be higher than 
consumption today (even accounting for 
climate impacts), so diminishing 
marginal utility implies that the same 
monetary damage will cause a smaller 
reduction of utility in the future. 
Standard estimates of this term from the 
economics literature are in the range of 
3 to 5 percent. The second component 
reflects the possibility that a lower 
weight should be placed on utility in 
the future, to account for social 
impatience or extinction risk, which is 
specified by a pure rate of time 
preference (PRTP). A conventional 
estimate of the PRTP is 2 percent. (Some 
observers believe that a principle of 
intergenerational equity suggests that 
the PRTP should be close to zero.) It 
follows that discount rate of 5 percent 
is within the range of values which are 
able to be derived from the Ramsey 
equation, albeit at the low end of the 
range of estimates usually associated 
with Ramsey discounting. 
It is recognized that the arguments 
above—for use of market behavior and 
the Ramsey equation—face objections in 
the context of climate change, and of 
course there are alternative approaches. 
In light of climate change, it is possible 
that consumption in the future will not 
be higher than consumption today, and 
if so, the Ramsey equation will suggest 
a lower figure. Some people have 
suggested that a very low discount rate, 
below 3 percent, is justified in light of 
the ethical considerations calling for a 
principle of intergenerational neutrality. 
See Nicholas Stern, ‘‘The Economics of 
Climate Change’’ (2007); for contrary 
views, see William Nordhaus, A 
Question of Balance (2008); Martin 
Weitzman, ‘‘Review of the Stern Review 
on the Economics of Climate Change.’’ 
Journal of Economic Literature, 45(3): 
703–724 (2007). Additionally, some 
analyses attempt to deal with 
uncertainty with respect to interest rates 
over time; a possible approach enabling 
the consideration of such uncertainties 
is discussed below. Richard Newell and 
William Pizer, ‘‘Discounting the Distant 
Future: How Much Do Uncertain Rates 
Increase Valuations?’’ J. Environ. Econ. 
Manage. 46 (2003) 52–71. 
The application of the methodology 
outlined above yields estimates of the 
SCC that are reported in Table IV.31. 
These estimates are reported separately 
using 3 percent and 5 percent discount 
rates. The cells are empty in rows 10 
and 11 because these studies did not 
report estimates of the SCC at a 3 
percent discount rate. The model- 
weighted means are reported in the final 
or summary row; they are $33 per tCO2 
at a 3% discount rate and $5 per tCO2 
with a 5% discount rate.

Summary ............................................................................................ Model-weighted Mean ................................. 33 5 
* The sample includes all peer reviewed, non-equity-weighted estimates included in Tol (2008), Nordhaus (2008), Hope (2008), and Anthoff et 
al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios. All val-
ues are based on the best available information from the underlying studies about the base year and year dollars, rather than the Tol (2008) as-
sumption that all estimates included in his review are 1995 values in 1995$. All values were updated to 2007 using a 3 percent annual growth 
rate in the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. 
DOE used the model-weighted mean 
values of $33 and $5 per ton (2007$), as 
these represent the estimates associated 
with the 3 percent and 5 percent 
discount rates, respectively. The 3 
percent and 5 percent estimates have 
independent appeal and at this time a 
clear preference for one over the other 
is not warranted. These values were 
then escalated to 2008$ and rounded to 
$34 and $5. Thus, DOE has also 
included—and centered its current 
attention on—the average of the 
estimates associated with these discount 
rates, which is approximately $20 (in 
2008$). (Based on the $20 global value, 
the domestic value would be 
approximately $1 per ton of CO2 
equivalent.) 
It is true that there is uncertainty 
about interest rates over long time 
horizons. Recognizing that point, 
Newell and Pizer have made a careful 
effort to adjust for that uncertainty. See 
Newell and Pizer, supra. This is a 
relatively recent contribution to the 
literature. 
There are several concerns with using 
this approach in this context. First, it 
would be a departure from current OMB 
guidance. Second, an approach that 
would average what emerges from 
discount rates of 3 percent and 5 
percent reflects uncertainty about the 
discount rate, but based on a different 
model of uncertainty. The Newell-Pizer 
approach models discount rate 
uncertainty as something that evolves 
over time; in contrast, one alternative 
approach would assume that there is a 
single discount rate with equal 
probability of 3 percent and 5 percent. 
Table IV.32 reports on the application 
of the Newell-Pizer adjustments. The 
precise numbers depend on the 
assumptions about the data generating 
process that governs interest rates. 
Columns (1a) and (1b) assume that 
‘‘random walk’’ model best describes 
the data and uses 3 percent and 5 
percent discount rates, respectively. 
Columns (2a) and (2b) repeat this, 
except that it assumes a ‘‘mean- 
reverting’’ process. As Newell and Pizer 
report, there is stronger empirical 
support for the random walk model.

* The sample includes all peer reviewed, non-equity-weighted estimates included in Tol (2008), Nordhaus (2008), Hope (2008), and Anthoff et 
al. (2009), that are based on the most recent published version of FUND, PAGE, or DICE and use business-as-usual climate scenarios. All val-
ues are based on the best available information from the underlying studies about the base year and year dollars, rather than the Tol (2008) as-
sumption that all estimates included in his review are 1995 values in 1995$. All values were updated to 2007 using a 3 percent annual growth 
rate in the SCC, and adjusted for inflation using GDP deflator. 
** Assumes a starting discount rate of 3 percent. Newell and Pizer (2003) based adjustment factors are not applied to estimates from Guo et 
al. (2006) that use a different approach to account for discount rate uncertainty (rows 7–8). 
The resulting estimates of the social 
cost of carbon are necessarily greater. 
When the adjustments from the random 
walk model are applied, the estimates of 
the social cost of carbon are $10 and $55 
(2007$), with the 5 percent and 3 
percent discount rates, respectively. The 
application of the mean-reverting 
adjustment yields estimates of $6 and 
$36 (2007$). Since the random walk 
model has greater support from the data, 
DOE also used the SCC values of $10 
and $55 (2007$). When escalated to 
2008$, these values were approximately 
$10 and $56. 
In summary, in considering the

reduced CO2 emissions, DOE used 
values based on a social cost of carbon

$56 per metric ton avoided in 2007 
(values expressed in 2008$). DOE also 
calculated the domestic benefits based 
on a value of approximately $1 per 
metric ton avoided in 2007. To monetize 
the CO2 emissions reductions expected 
to result from amended standards for 
heating products in 2013–2045, DOE 
escalated the above values for 2007 
using a three-percent escalation rate. As 
indicated in the discussion above, 
estimates of SCC are assumed to 
increase over time since future 
emissions are expected to produce 
larger incremental damages as physical 
and economic systems become more 
stressed as the magnitude of climate 
change increases. Although most studies 
that estimate economic damages caused 
by increased GHG emissions in future 
years produce an implied growth rate in 
the SCC, neither the rate itself nor the 
information necessary to derive its 
implied value is commonly reported. 
However, applying a rate of 3 percent 
per year is consistent with the range 
recommended by IPCC (2007). 
DOE recognizes that scientific and 
economic knowledge about the 
contribution of CO2 and other GHG to 
changes in the future global climate and 
the potential resulting damages to the 
world economy continues to evolve 
rapidly. Thus, any value placed in this 
rulemaking on CO2 emissions reduction 
is subject to change. DOE, together with 
other Federal agencies, will continue to 
review various methodologies for 
estimating the monetary value of 
reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse 
gas emissions. This ongoing review will 
consider the comments on this subject 
that are part of the public record for this 
and other rulemakings, as well as other 
methodological assumptions and issues. 
However, consistent with DOE’s legal 
obligations, and taking into account the 
uncertainty involved with this 
particular issue, DOE has included in 
this proposed rule the most recent 
values and analyses resulting from the 
ongoing interagency review process. 
3. Valuation of Other Emissions 
Reductions 
DOE also investigated the potential 
monetary benefit of reduced NOX and 
Hg emissions from the TSLs it 
considered. As previously stated, DOE’s 
analysis assumed the presence of 
nationwide emission caps on SO2 and 
caps on NOX emissions in the 28 States 
covered by the CAIR. In the presence of 
these caps, the NEMS–BT modeling 
system that DOE used to forecast 
emissions reduction indicated that no 
physical reductions in power sector 
emissions would occur for SO2, but that 
the standards could put slight 
downward pressure on the prices of 
emissions allowances in cap-and-trade 
markets. Estimating this effect is very 
difficult because such factors as credit 
banking can change the trajectory of 
prices. From its modeling to date, DOE 
is unable to estimate a benefit from SO2 
emissions reductions at this time. See 
the environmental assessment in the 
NOPR TSD for further details. 
As noted above, new or amended 
energy conservation standards would 
reduce NOX emissions in those 22 States 
that are not affected by the CAIR, in 
addition to the reduction in site NOX 
emissions nationwide. DOE estimated 
the monetized value of NOX emissions 
reductions resulting from each of the 
TSLs considered for today’s NOPR 
based on environmental damage 
estimates from the literature. Available 
estimates suggest a very wide range of 
monetary values, ranging from $370 per 
ton to $3,800 per ton of NOX from 
stationary sources, measured in 2001$ 
(equivalent to a range of $442 to $4,540 
per ton in 2008$). Refer to the OMB, 
Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs, ‘‘2006 Report to Congress on the 
Costs and Benefits of Federal 
Regulations and Unfunded Mandates on 
State, Local, and Tribal Entities,’’ 
Washington, DC, for additional 
information. 
For Hg emissions reductions, DOE 
estimated the monetized values 
resulting from the TSLs considered for 
today’s NOPR based on environmental 
damage estimates from the literature. 
The impact of mercury emissions from 
power plants on humans is considered 
highly uncertain. However, DOE 
identified two estimates of the 
environmental damage of mercury based 
on estimates of the adverse impact of 
childhood exposure to methyl mercury 
on intelligence quotient (IQ) for 
American children, and subsequent loss 
of lifetime economic productivity 
resulting from these IQ losses. The high- 
end estimate is based on an estimate of 
the current aggregate cost of the loss of 
IQ in American children that results 
from exposure to mercury of U.S. power 
plant origin ($1.3 billion per year in 
2000$), which works out to $33.3 
million per ton emitted per year 
(2008$). Refer to L. Trasande et al., 
‘‘Applying Cost Analyses to Drive 
Policy that Protects Children,’’ 1076 
Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 911 (2006) for 
additional information. DOE’s low-end 
estimate is $0.66 million per ton emitted 
(in 2004$) or $0.745 million per ton in 
2008$. DOE derived this estimate from 
an evaluation of mercury control that 
used different methods and assumptions 
from the first study but was also based 
on the present value of the lifetime 
earnings of children exposed. See Ted 
Gayer and Robert Hahn, ‘‘Designing 
Environmental Policy: Lessons from the 
Regulation of Mercury Emissions,’’ 
Regulatory Analysis 05–01, AEI- 
Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory 
Studies, Washington, DC (2004). A 
version of this paper was published in 
the Journal of Regulatory Economics in 
2006. 
EEI stated that the costs of 
remediating emissions of CO2, SO2, 
NOX, and Hg are included in the rates 
customers pay, so monetizing their 
values would be double counting. (EEI, 
No. 40 at p. 6) DOE understands the 
comment as referring to actions power 
plant operators take to meet 
environmental regulations, the costs of 
which are reflected in electricity rates. 
With regulations currently in place, 
revised standards for heating products 
would result in a reduction in CO2, 
NOX, and Hg emissions by avoiding 
electricity generation. Because these 
emissions impose societal costs, their 
reduction has an economic value that 
can be estimated. 
Earthjustice stated that DOE must 
calculate and monetize the value of the 
reductions in emissions of particulate 
matter (PM) that will result from 
standards; even if DOE cannot consider 
secondary PM emissions, it must 
consider primary emissions. 
(Earthjustice, No. 47 at p. 5) DOE agrees 
that PM impacts are of concern due to 
human exposures that can impact 
health. But impacts of PM emissions 
reduction are much more difficult to 
estimate than other emissions 
reductions due to the complex 
interactions between PM, other power 
plant emissions, meteorology and 
atmospheric chemistry that impact 
human exposure to particulates. Human 
exposure to PM usually occurs at a 
significant distance from the power 
plants that are emitting particulates and 
particulate precursors. When power 
plant emissions travel this distance they 
undergo highly complex atmospheric 
chemical reactions. While the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
does keep inventories of direct PM 
emissions of power plants, in its source 
attribution reviews the EPA does not 
separate direct PM emissions from 
power plants from the particulates 
indirectly produced through complex 
atmospheric chemical reactions. This is 
in part because SO2 emissions react 
with direct PM emissions particles to 
produce combined sulfate particulates. 
Thus it is not useful to examine how the 
standard impacts direct PM emissions 
independent of indirect PM production 
and atmospheric dynamics. DOE is not 
currently able to run a model that can

make these estimates reliably at the 
national level. 
Earthjustice stated that DOE must 
consider coming climate change 
legislation and a national cap on carbon 
emissions and must account for the 
effect of the standards in reducing 
allowance prices. (Earthjustice, No. 47 
at p. 4) Because no climate change 
legislation has been enacted to date, the 
timing and shape of any national cap on 
carbon emissions is uncertain at this 
point. Therefore, DOE did not account 
for such a cap in its NOPR analysis. 
V. Analytical Results 
A. Trial Standard Levels 
DOE analyzed the benefits and 
burdens of a number of TSLs for each 
of the three types of heating products 
separately. For a given product 
consisting of several product classes, 
DOE developed some of the TSLs so that 
each TSL is comprised of energy 
efficiency levels from each product class 
that exhibit similar characteristics. For 
example, in the case of water heaters, 
one of the TSLs consists of the max-tech 
efficiency levels from each product class 
being considered for this rulemaking. 
DOE attempted to limit the number of 
TSLs considered for the NOPR by 
eliminating efficiency levels that do not 
exhibit significantly different economic 
and/or engineering characteristics from 
the efficiency levels already selected as 
a TSL. A description of each TSL DOE 
analyzed for each of the three types of 
heating products is provided below. 
While DOE only presents the results for 
those efficiency levels in TSL 
combinations in today’s NOPR, DOE 
presents the results for all efficiency 
levels analyzed in the NOPR TSD. DOE 
requests comments on the results for all 
of the efficiency levels since DOE could 
consider any combination of efficiency 
levels for the final rule as a result of 
comments from interested parties. 
1. Water Heaters 
Table V.1 shows the seven TSLs DOE 
analyzed for water heaters. Since 
amended water heater standards would 
apply to the full range of storage 
volumes, DOE is presenting the TSLs for 
water heaters in terms of the energy 
efficiency equations, rather than only 
showing the required efficiency level at 
the representative capacities. As 
discussed in section IV.C.7, DOE is 
using the alternative energy-efficiency 
equations developed in the engineering 
analysis for the NOPR. DOE is grouping 
the energy efficiency equations for each 
of the four water heater product classes 
to show the benefits and burdens of 
amended energy conservation 
standards. 
For TSL 1, 2, 3, and 4, DOE is using 
the rated storage volume divisions and 
the energy efficiency equations as 
shown in section IV.C.7, which specify 
a two-slope approach. TSL 1 consists of 
the efficiency levels for each product 
class that are approximately equal to the 
current shipment-weighted average 
efficiency. TSL 2 and TSL 3 consist of 
efficiency levels with slightly higher 
efficiencies compared to TSL 1 for most 
of the product classes. TSL 4 represents 
the maximum electric resistance water 
heater efficiency across the entire range 
of storage volumes that DOE analyzed 
for electric storage water heaters, and 
the maximum atmospherically vented 
efficiency across the entire range of 
storage volumes that DOE analyzed for 
gas-fired storage water heaters. 
For TSL 5, DOE further modified the 
two-slope approach developed in the 
engineering analysis. For this TSL, DOE 
considers a pairing of efficiency levels 
that would promote the penetration of 
advanced technologies into the electric 
and gas-fired storage water heater 
markets and potentially save additional 
energy by using a two-slope approach 
with different requirements for each 
subsection. Consequently, DOE pairs an 
efficiency level requiring heat pump 
technology for large-volume electric 
storage water heaters with an efficiency 
level achievable using electric resistance 
technology for small-volume electric 
storage water heaters. In addition, DOE 
pairs an efficiency level requiring 
condensing technology for large-volume 
gas storage water heaters with an 
efficiency level that can be achieved in 
atmospherically vented gas-fired storage 
water heaters with increased insulation 
thickness for small storage volumes. 
In addition to pairing different 
technologies for small and large volume 
products for TSL 5, DOE also modified 
the division point between small- 
volume and large-volume gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters. DOE used 
an analysis of market data to determine 
the initial division points (see section 
IV.C.7 for details), which were 60 
gallons for gas-fired storage water 
heaters and 80 gallons for electric 
storage water heaters. These division 
points are used to modify the two-slope 
equations for TSLs 1, 2, 3, and 4 (as well 
as TSLs 6 and 7, described below). 
Because DOE pairs two different 
technologies for consideration as an 
amended standard in TSL 5, DOE is 
concerned that manufacturers may 
attempt to circumvent the increased 
standards for large-volume water heaters 
by producing water heaters at volumes 
just below the division points. As a 
result, DOE has chosen to modify the 
division points for TSL 5 to 55 gallons 
for gas-fired and electric storage water 
heaters to attempt to mitigate the 
potential loophole. TSL 5 includes 
efficiency levels that effectively require 
heat pump technology for electric 
storage water heater with rated storage 
volumes above 55 gallons, and 
efficiency levels that effectively require 
condensing technology for gas-fired 
storage water heaters with rated storage 
volumes above 55 gallons. Using DOE’s 
shipments model and market 
assessment, DOE estimated 
approximately 4 percent of gas-fired 
storage water heater shipments and 11 
percent of models would be subject to 
the large-volume water heater 
requirements using the TSL 5 division. 
Similarly, DOE estimated approximately 
9 percent of electric storage water heater 
shipments and 27 percent of models 
would be subject to the large volume 
water heater requirements using the TSL 
5 division. 
DOE specifically seeks comment on 
the different approach taken in TSL 5, 
including the rated storage volume 
division of 55 gallons between small 
and large storage volumes for gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters at TSL 
5. In particular, DOE is interested in 
comments from interested parties 
regarding whether DOE should consider 
an alternative division in the final rule, 
including (but not limited to), 66 gallons 
or 75 gallons. In addition, DOE seeks 
comments regarding whether different 
divisions should be specified for gas- 
fired and electric storage water heaters 
such that a similar percentage of the 
market is impacted in terms of 
shipments and/or models. 
TSL 6 uses the same divisions as TSL 
1, 2, 3, and 4 for gas-fired water heaters. 
TSL 6 is identical to TSL 4 except DOE 
is considering a heat pump water heater 
level for electric storage water heaters 
across the entire range of storage 
volumes, which is compatible with 
ENERGY STAR criteria for electric 
storage water heaters at the 
representative rated storage volume. 
DOE did use a division point for the 
max-tech energy efficiency equations as 
described in the engineering analysis. 
TSL 7 consists of the max-tech 
efficiency levels for each of the water 
heater product classes at the time the 
analysis was developed. TSL 6 and 7 
both require efficiency levels that can be 
met using heat pump technology for 
electric storage water heaters. TSL 7, 
however, requires a higher efficiency 
level than TSL 6, which corresponds to 
the max-tech efficiency level for the 
representative rated storage capacity 
(i.e., 2.2 EF at 50 gallons). TSL 7 also

B. Economic Justification and Energy 
Savings 
1. Economic Impacts on Consumers 
a. Life-Cycle Cost and Payback Period 
Consumers affected by new or 
amended standards usually experience 
higher purchase prices and lower 
operating costs. Generally, these 
impacts are best captured by changes in 
life-cycle costs and payback period. 
Therefore, DOE calculated the LCC and 
PBP for the potential standard levels 
considered in this rulemaking. DOE’s 
LCC and PBP analyses provided key 
outputs for each TSL, which are 
reported by product in Table V.4 
through Table V.13, below. In each 
table, the first two outputs are the 
average total LCC and the average LCC 
savings. The next three outputs show 
the percentage of households where the 
purchase of a product complying with 
each TSL would create a net life-cycle 
cost, no impact, or a net life-cycle 
savings for the purchaser. The last 
outputs are the median PBP and the 
average PBP for the consumer 
purchasing a design that complies with 
the TSL. The results for each TSL are 
relative to the efficiency distribution in 
the base case (no amended standards). 
DOE based its LCC and PBP analyses 
for heating products on energy 
consumption under conditions of actual 
use, whereas it based the rebuttable 
presumption PBP test on consumption 
under conditions prescribed by the DOE 
test procedure, as required by EPCA. (42

* For TSL 4, DOE determined that 14 percent of the consumers will experience a net cost smaller than 2 percent of their total LCC (see chap-

b. Analysis of Consumer Subgroups 
For gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters, and gas wall fan and gas 
wall gravity DHE, DOE estimated 
consumer subgroup impacts for low- 
income households and senior-only 
households. In addition, for gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters, DOE 
estimated consumer subgroup impacts 
for households in multi-family housing 
and households in manufactured homes 
as well. (As a reminder and as explained 
in section IV.6, not all products in this 
rulemaking were included in DOE’s 
consumer subgroup analysis.) 
For gas-fired storage water heaters, the 
impacts of the proposed standard (0.63 
EF) are roughly the same for the senior- 
only sample and the low-income sample 
as they are for the full household 
sample for this product class. For the 
multi-family sample and the 
manufactured home sample, the average 
LCC savings are somewhat lower than 
they are for the full household sample, 
and the fraction of households 
experiencing a cost (negative savings) is 
higher. In both cases, however, the 
average LCC savings is positive, and 
more than half of the households in the 
identified subgroups would experience 
an LCC benefit. 
For electric storage water heaters, the 
impacts of the proposed TSL 4 standard 
(0.95 EF) are roughly the same for the 
senior-only sample as they are for the 
full household sample for this product 
class. The impacts are slightly more 
negative for the low-income sample, and 
they are moderately more negative for 
the multi-family sample and the 
manufactured home sample. The 
average LCC savings are ¥$2 for the 
latter two subgroups, but in both cases, 
more than half of the households in the 
identified subgroups would experience 
an LCC benefit. 
In the case of a standard for electric 
storage water heaters at TSL 5, which 
would require 2.0 EF only for large- 
volume water heaters, the negative 
subgroup impacts seen in the case of 
TSL 6 are substantially less because 
only a small fraction of the households 
in the subgroups has large-volume water 
heaters for which the standard would 
effectively require a heat pump water 
heater. 
In the case of a standard for electric 
storage water heaters at TSL 6, the 
average LCC savings are lower for all of 
the subgroups than for the full 
household sample for this product class. 
The multi-family subgroup would 
experience an average negative LCC 
savings of $359 (i.e., the average LCC 
would increase), and three-fourths of 
the households in the subgroup would 
experience a net cost. For the other 
subgroups, the fraction of households 
that would experience a net cost is close 
to or just above 50 percent, which is 
slightly higher than for the full 
household sample. The impact on the 
multi-family subgroup is primarily due 
to the lower hot water use among these 
households. 
For gas wall fan and gas wall gravity 
DHE, DOE estimated that the impacts of 
the proposed standards are roughly the 
same for the senior-only sample and the 
low-income sample as they are for the 
full household sample for these product 
classes. 
Chapter 11 of the NOPR TSD presents 
the detailed results of the consumer 
subgroup analysis.

c. Rebuttable Presumption Payback 
As discussed above, EPCA provides a 
rebuttable presumption that an energy 
conservation standard is economically 
justified if the increased purchase cost 
for a product that meets the standard is 
less than three times the value of the 
first-year energy savings resulting from 
the standard (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(iii)) DOE’s LCC and PBP 
analyses generate values that calculate 
the payback period for consumers of 
potential energy conservation standards, 
which includes, but is not limited to, 
the three-year payback period 
contemplated under the rebuttable 
presumption test discussed above. 
However, DOE routinely conducts a full 
economic analysis that considers the 
full range of impacts, including those to 
the consumer, manufacturer, Nation, 
and environment, as required under 42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i). 
In the present case, DOE calculated a 
rebuttable presumption payback period 
for each TSL. Rather than using 
distributions for input values, DOE used 
discrete values and, as required by 
EPCA, based the calculation on the 
assumptions in the DOE test procedures 
for the three types of heating products. 
As a result, DOE calculated a single 
rebuttable presumption payback value, 
and not a distribution of payback 
periods, for each standard level. Table 
V.15 through Table V.17 show the 
rebuttable presumption payback periods 
that are less than 3 years. For gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters and 
gas wall gravity DHE and gas room DHE, 
there were no payback periods under 3 
years. 
While DOE examined the rebuttable- 
presumption criterion, it considered 
whether the standard levels considered 
for today’s rule are economically 
justified through a more detailed 
analysis of the economic impacts of 
these levels pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i). The results of this 
analysis serve as the basis for DOE to 
definitively evaluate the economic 
justification for a potential standard 
level (thereby supporting or rebutting 
the results of any preliminary 
determination of economic 
justification).

2. Economic Impacts on Manufacturers 
DOE performed an MIA to estimate 
the impact of amended energy 
conservation standards on 
manufacturers of residential water 
heaters, DHE, and pool heaters. Chapter 
12 of the NOPR TSD explains this 
analysis in further detail. The tables 
below depict the financial impacts on 
manufacturers (represented by changes 
in INPV) and the conversion costs DOE 
estimates manufacturers would incur at 
each TSL. DOE shows the results by 
grouping product classes made by the 
same manufacturer and uses the 
scenarios that show the likely changes 
in industry value following amended 
energy conservation standards. In the 
following discussion, the INPV results 
refer the difference in industry value 
between the base case and the standards 
case that result from the sum of 
discounted cash flows from the base 
year (2010) through the end of the 
analysis period. The results also discuss 
the difference in cash flow between the 
base case and the standards case in the 
year before the compliance date of 
amended energy conservation 
standards. This figure gives a 
representation of how large the required 
conversion costs are relative to the cash 
flow generated by the industry in the 
absence of amended energy 
conservation standards. In the 
engineering analysis, DOE presents its 
findings of the common technology 
options that achieve the efficiencies for 
each of the representative product 
classes. To refer to the description of 
technology options and the required 
efficiencies at each TSL, see section 
IV.C of today’s notice. 
a. Water Heater Cash-Flow Analysis 
Results 
DOE modeled two different markup 
scenarios to estimate the potential 
impacts of amended energy 
conservation standards on residential 
water heater manufacturers. To assess 
the lower end of the range of potential 
impacts on water heater manufacturers, 
DOE modeled the preservation of return 
on invested capital scenario. Besides the 
impact of the main NIA shipment 
scenario and the required capital and 
product conversion costs on INPV, this 
case models that manufacturers would

maintain the base-case return on 
invested capital in the standards case. 
This scenario represents the lower end 
of the range of potential impacts on 
manufacturers because manufacturers 
generate a historical rate of additional 
operating profit on the physical and 
financial investments required by 
energy conservation standards. 
To assess the higher end of the range 
of potential impacts on the residential 
water heater industry, DOE modeled the 
preservation of operating profit markup 
scenario in which higher energy 
conservation standards result in lower 
manufacturer markups. This scenario 
models manufacturers’ concerns about 
the higher costs of more efficient 
technology harming profitability. The 
scenario represents the upper end of the 
range of potential impacts on 
manufacturers only because no 
additional operating profit is earned on 
the investments required the meet the 
amended energy conservation 
standards. The results of these scenarios 
for the residential water heater industry 
are presented in Table V.18 through 
Table V.23.

TSL 1 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 0.59 
EF to 0.62 EF for gas-fired storage water 
heaters for the representative rated 
storage volume of 40 gallons. For 
electric storage water heaters TSL 1 
represents an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 0.90 EF to 
0.92 EF for the representative rated 
storage volume of 50 gallons. At TSL 1, 
DOE estimates the impacts on INPV to 
range from ¥$3.8 million to ¥$12.3 
million, or a change in INPV of ¥0.45 
percent to ¥1.46 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 4.8 percent, 
to $58.1 million, compared to the base- 
case value of $61.0 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. Currently, 
over 75 percent of the gas-fired storage 
water heaters are sold at the baseline 
level. However, all manufacturers also 
offer a full line of gas-fired storage water 
heaters that meet the gas-fired 
efficiencies at TSL 1. Although the 
majority of the electric storage water 
heater shipments do not meet TSL 1, 
every manufacturer also offers a full line 
of electric storage water heaters at or 
above this level. Because manufacturers 
have existing products and 
manufacturers could reach the required 
efficiencies with relatively minor 
changes to the foam insulation thickness 
at TSL 1, manufacturers of gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters would 
have minimal conversion costs at TSL 1. 
Because the technology required at TSL 
1 is similar to the baseline, the INPV 
impacts are similar for both markup 
scenarios. It is hence unlikely that TSL 
1 would greatly reduce manufacturers’ 
profitability. 
TSL 2 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 0.59 
EF to 0.63 EF for gas-fired storage water 
heaters for the representative rated 
storage volume of 40 gallons. For 
electric storage water heaters, TSL 2 
represents an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 0.90 EF to 
0.93 EF for the representative rated 
storage volume of 50 gallons. At TSL 2, 
DOE estimates the impacts on INPV to 
range from ¥$5.1 million to ¥$30.7 
million, or a change in INPV of ¥0.60 
percent to ¥3.64 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 8.7 percent, 
to $55.7 million, compared to the base- 
case value of $61.0 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. Currently, 
over 80 percent of the gas-fired storage 
water heaters sold do not meet TSL 2. 
At TSL 2, manufacturers are expected to 
meet the gas-fired efficiency 
requirements by adding additional 
insulation to their existing products. 
The conversion costs at TSL 2 are

relatively minor for gas-fired storage 
water heaters because most 
manufacturers have a full line of 
products at the required efficiency for 
TSL 2 and only minor changes in the 
manufacturing process would be 
required. Although the majority of the 
electric storage water heater market is 
below the efficiency specified for 
electric storage water heaters at TSL 2, 
more than 28 percent of the market is 
at or above this level. Manufacturers 
would have increasing conversion costs 
for both capital and product conversion 
for electric storage water heaters to 
modify production facilities to 
accommodate the extra insulation 
required at TSL 2. Because the 
technology required at TSL 2 is similar 
to the baseline for gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters, however, it is 
unlikely that TSL 2 would greatly 
impact manufacturers’ profitability. 
Similar to TSL 2, TSL 3 represents an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 0.59 EF to 0.63 EF for 
gas-fired storage water heaters for the 
representative rated storage volume of 
40 gallons. Because the efficiency 
requirements for gas-fired storage water 
heaters are the same at TSL 3 as at TSL 
2, the impacts on manufacturers are the 
same as at TSL 2 for the gas-fired storage 
efficiency requirements. There are small 
impacts on manufacturers to improve 
the efficiency of the majority of the gas- 
fired storage shipments from the 
baseline. However, because these 
changes are expected to be relatively 
minor increases to the insulation 
thickness, the impacts on the industry 
are not substantial because these 
changes do not greatly alter the current 
manufacturing process. TSL 3 
represents a further improvement in 
efficiency for electric storage water 
heaters from the baseline level of 0.90 
EF to 0.94 EF for the representative 
rated storage volume of 50 gallons. To 
achieve the efficiency levels for TSL 3, 
electric storage manufacturers would be 
expected to further increase tank 
insulation thickness, with still relatively 
small conversion costs because many 
manufacturers already manufacture 
storage water heaters at TSL 3. DOE 
estimates the INPV impacts to range 
from ¥$4.9 million to ¥$35.3 million, 
or a change in INPV of ¥0.59 percent 
to ¥4.19 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 8.7 percent 
to $55.7 million, compared to the base- 
case value of $61.0 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. 
Similar to TSL 2 and TSL 3, TSL 4 
represents an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 0.59 EF to 
0.63 EF for gas-fired storage water 
heaters for the representative rated 
storage volume of 40 gallons. Because 
the efficiency requirements for gas-fired 
storage water heaters are the same at 
TSL 4 as at TSL 2 and TSL 3, the 
impacts on gas-fired manufacturers are 
the same. There are small impacts on 
manufacturers to improve the efficiency 
of the majority of the gas-fired storage 
shipments from the baseline. However, 
because these changes are expected to 
be relatively minor increases to the 
insulation thickness, the impacts on the 
industry are not substantial because 
these changes do not greatly alter the 
current manufacturing process. TSL 4 
represents a further improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 0.90 
EF to 0.95 EF for electric storage water 
heaters at the representative rated 
storage volume of 50 gallons. Based on 
a review of units on the market at these 
efficiency levels, DOE expects that 
manufacturers would likely further 
increase insulation levels. Because not 
all manufacturers have models at this 
efficiency currently available on the 
market, however, DOE expects that 
electric storage water heater 
manufacturers would incur higher 
conversion costs at TSL 4 than at TSL 
3. At TSL 4, DOE estimates the INPV 
impacts to range from ¥$3.5 million to 
¥$78.8 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥0.41 percent to ¥9.35 percent. At this 
level, the industry cash flow is 
estimated to decrease by approximately 
33.2 percent to $40.8 million, compared 
to the base-case value of $61.0 million 
in the year leading up to the standards. 
Only a small number of electric storage 
water heaters on the market meet the 
efficiency level for electric storage water 
heaters required by TSL 4. Electric 
storage manufacturers would have 
increasing conversion costs for both 
capital and product conversion to 
greatly increase the production of low 
volume products. The capital 
conversion costs for electric storage 
water heaters are more substantial than 
for gas-fired storage water heaters 
because each production line would 
require additional foaming stations to 
accommodate the greatly increased 
insulation thicknesses and, due to 
slower production speeds, adding 
additional production lines in existing 
facilities to maintain current shipment 
volumes. Manufacturers also noted that 
they were concerned about TSL 4 for 
electric storage water heaters because of 
problems with the test procedure that 
could make it difficult replicate the 
efficiencies required at this TSL. 
TSL 5 has the same efficiency 
requirements as TSL 4 for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters with rated 
storage volumes less than 55 gallons. 
Because the efficiency requirements for 
gas-fired and electric storage water 
heaters with rated storage volumes less 
than 55 gallons are equal to TSL 4, at 
TSL 5 manufacturers share the same 
concerns for these rated storage volumes 
as at TSL 4. However, the efficiency 
requirements for gas-fired storage water 
heaters with rated storage volumes 
greater than 55 gallons effectively 
require condensing technology, and the 
efficiency requirements for electric 
storage water heaters with rated storage 
volumes greater than 55 gallons 
effectively require heat pump 
technology. At TSL 5, DOE estimates the 
INPV impacts to range from ¥$20.9 
million to ¥$129.9 million, or a change 
in INPV of ¥2.48 percent to ¥15.41 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow is estimated to decrease by 
approximately 55.6 percent to $27.1 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $61.0 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. The higher, 
negative impacts on INPV are largely 
caused by the additional conversion 
costs required to substantially change 
the technology commonly used in large 
size gas-fired and electric storage water 
heaters today. DOE estimates the 
approximately 4 percent of gas-fired 
storage water heater shipments with 
rated volumes greater than 55 gallons 
would require an additional $13 million 
in conversion costs to use condensing 
technology. DOE estimates the 
approximately 9 percent of gas-fired 
storage water heater shipments with 
rated volumes greater than 55 gallons 
would require an additional $24 million 
in conversion costs to use heat pump 
technology. 
Much of the additional capital 
conversion costs calculated for large 
volume sizes at TSL 5 involve creating 
an additional gas-fired and electric 
assembly line in a facility adjacent to a 
current production facility. Because 
high-volume manufacturing facilities 
are typically arranged for units with 
similar assembly processes, the more 
complex technology used for larger 
rated volumes at TSL 5 could not be 
accommodated on existing production 
lines. The estimated product conversion 
costs at TSL 5 would involve retraining 
existing service and installation 
personnel, who have little experience 
installing and servicing storage water 
heaters that use these advanced 
technologies. To minimize unit damage 
and warranty claims and improve 
market acceptance, manufacturers 
would likely have to expend significant 
additional resources to hire training 
staff to provide more technical support.

The other portion of the product 
conversion costs for large rated volumes 
are the product development effort to 
redesign existing products. 
Manufacturers could face constraints 
regarding the abilities of their 
engineering teams to develop multiple 
water heater families at TSL 5, as most 
engineering departments have limited 
experience with either technology. At a 
minimum, the efficiency requirements 
at TSL 5 would require manufacturers to 
convert existing commercial condensing 
gas products for residential use. 
However, multiple manufacturers 
would also have to develop completely 
new platforms in order to remain cost- 
competitive. Even if a manufacturer 
were to offer incur these high 
conversion costs, the high product 
development and capital conversion 
costs for a small segment of the overall 
market make it likely that consumers 
will have fewer product families to 
choose from after the compliance date of 
the final rule. 
Even if manufacturers offer gas 
condensing and electric heat pump 
water heaters for the large gallon sizes 
at TSL 5, there could be additional, 
negative impacts on consumers that 
could lead to a smaller market for these 
products. Consumers might no longer 
purchase water heaters with rated 
storage volumes above 55 gallons 
because of substantially higher 
increased first costs than most products 
currently on the market, the unfamiliar 
technologies, and size limitations. 
Because of these changes in the market, 
at TSL 5, manufacturers could decide 
that the demand for residential heat 
pump and condensing gas water heaters 
would drop to a point where the high 
product conversion and capital costs 
required for a small portion of total 
shipments are not justified. As a result, 
manufacturers would no longer 
manufacture residential storage water 
heaters at rated storage volumes above 
55 gallons. In addition, consumers 
could be impacted if fewer contractors 
were willing to install these more 
complex products, especially if field 
technicians did not obtain any 
additional licenses and test equipment 
that could be required to service heat 
pump water heaters. These additional 
requirements would also likely increase 
installation and service costs beyond 
current levels since consumers would 
have fewer servicers/installers to choose 
from. 
Similar to TSL 2 through TSL 4, 
TSL 6 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 0.59 
EF to 0.63 EF for gas-fired storage water 
heaters for the representative rated 
storage volume of 40 gallons. Similarly, 
the impacts on manufacturers due to the 
gas-fired storage efficiencies are 
relatively minor because the required 
efficiencies for all volume sizes can 
likely be met with relatively minor 
changes to the insulation thickness. For 
electric storage water heaters, TSL 6 
represents an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 0.90 EF to 
2.0 EF for electric storage water heaters 
at the representative rated storage 
volume of 50 gallons. At TSL 6, DOE 
estimates the impacts on INPV to range 
from ¥$2.0 million to ¥$305.8 million, 
or a change in INPV of ¥0.24 percent 
to ¥36.29 percent. At TSL 6, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 75.7 percent, 
to $14.8 million, compared to the base- 
case value of $61.0 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. To achieve 
efficiencies at or above TSL 6 would 
require the use of heat pumps for 
electric storage water heaters for all 
rated volumes, a technology option that 
has yet to see wide adoption in the U.S. 
market. The higher expected purchased 
part content and market pressures 
would be expected to reduce 
manufacturer profits margins 
substantially. Although most electric 
storage water heater manufacturers 
indicated that they are in the process of 
developing heat pump water heaters, all 
manufacturers believe that an efficiency 
level that requires heat pump water 
heater technology is not appropriate as 
an amended energy conservation 
standard. Manufacturers stated that they 
would face substantial costs to switch 
their entire electric storage water heater 
production over to heat pump electric 
storage water heaters. Several 
manufacturers expect that they will 
have to buy the heat pump modules 
from outside vendors since most water 
heater manufacturers have no 
experience manufacturing heat pumps 
and have limited space in their facilities 
to produce heat pump systems. Multiple 
manufacturers stated that even if they 
were to simply buy and integrate heat 
pump modules, there would be 
substantial product development and 
capital conversion costs because present 
facilities are not adequate to handle the 
heat pump modules. DOE estimates that 
manufacturers would incur almost $70 
million in capital conversion costs to 
modify production facilities to 
exclusively manufacture heat pump 
electric storage water heaters. These 
capital conversion cost estimates do not 
include the cost of building 
manufacturing capacity to produce the 
heat pump modules because DOE 
believes manufacturers will likely 
purchase these as subassemblies. 
Furthermore, manufacturers stated 
that they would consider moving all or 
part of their existing production 
capacity abroad if the energy 
conservation standard is set at TSL 6 
because many manufacturers expect that 
they would have to redesign their 
facilities completely to accommodate a 
minimum energy conservation standard 
at this TSL. According to these 
manufacturers, building a new facility 
entails less business disruption risk 
than attempting to completely redesign 
and upgrade existing facilities, and 
lower labor rates in Mexico and other 
countries abroad may entice 
manufacturers to move their production 
facilities outside of the U.S. In addition, 
manufacturers are very concerned about 
the significant number of customers 
who would face extremely costly 
installations for electric storage water 
heater replacements if a standard 
effectively requiring heat pump 
technology is mandated. According to 
manufacturers, a significant percentage 
of electric storage water heaters are 
installed in space-constrained 
environments which cannot 
accommodate the additional space 
required for the heat pump module. 
This is especially true for mobile homes 
and other consumer sub-groups that use 
smaller capacity tanks. 
Another concern of manufacturers at 
TSL 6 is the amount of additional 
training that would be necessary to 
upgrade the installation, distribution, 
and maintenance networks on the scale 
necessary to support an electric storage 
water heater market that used heat 
pump technology exclusively. Stated 
more simply, manufacturers are 
concerned that the typical installer or 
repair person would not have the 
requisite knowledge to troubleshoot or 
repair heat pump water heaters. 
Manufacturers also expressed concern 
about profitability if amendments to the 
minimum energy conservation standard 
for electric storage water heaters were to 
require the use of heat pump 
technology. An amended energy 
conservation standard that effectively 
mandated heat pump technology would 
completely change the nature of their 
business. The production costs for an 
integrated heat pump water heater at the 
50-gallon representative rated storage 
volume are approximately four times 
the baseline production costs. 
Specifically, manufacturers believe that 
because this technology results in much 
more expensive units than the majority 
of products on the market today, not all 
of the increased costs could be passed 
on to the customer. In addition, the 
significantly higher production costs

would require an additional $256 
million in working capital to purchase 
significantly more expensive 
components, carry more costly 
inventory, and handle higher accounts 
receivable. DOE estimates that the 
working capital requirement and 
conversion costs would cause electric 
storage water heater manufacturers to 
incur a total one-time investment of at 
least $375 million in an electric storage 
market valued at approximately $311 
million. Finally, manufacturers believe 
it is unlikely that they could earn the 
same return on these extremely large 
investments, so profitability would be 
expected to decrease after the 
compliance date of the amended energy 
conservation standards. 
TSL 7 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 
0.59 EF to 0.80 EF for gas-fired storage 
water heaters for the representative 
rated storage volume of 40 gallons. TSL 
7 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 0.90 
EF to 2.2 EF for electric storage water 
heaters at the representative rated 
storage volume of 50 gallons. At TSL 7, 
DOE estimates the impacts on INPV to 
range from $62.9 million to ¥$537.6 
million, or a change in INPV of 7.47 
percent to ¥63.79 percent. At TSL 7, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 171.6 
percent, to ¥$43.7 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $61.0 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
Because TSL 7 also requires improved 
heat pump technology (with additional 
efficiency-related improvements to both 
the heat pump module and the water 
heater tank), electric storage water 
heater manufacturers shared the same 
concerns at TSL 7 as they had at TSL 
6. Because additional, more-costly 
improvements to heat pump technology 
are required, however, electric storage 
water heater manufacturers were more 
concerned about the potential for energy 
conservation standards to greatly 
disrupt the industry if the amended 
energy conservation standard were set at 
TSL 7. 
For gas-fired storage water heaters, 
TSL 7 requires manufacturers to 
produce fully-condensing gas-fired 
storage water heaters, which is 
significantly more complex than the 
insulation changes required at most 
lower TSLs. Currently, no manufacturer 
offers residential gas-fired storage water 
heaters with condensing technology. 
Manufacturers would need to redesign 
their products at the condensing level, 
which would force manufacturers to 
incur significant product and capital 
conversion costs. Some loss in product 
utility may also occur for units that are 
presently installed in space-constrained 
applications because condensing water 
heaters require greater installation space 
to accommodate bigger heat exchangers, 
fully-installed blowers, and other 
components that non-condensing 
models do not feature. At the 
condensing level, manufacturers would 
be required to purchase substantial 
tooling to fabricate new coil and tank 
designs and make changes to all 
subassembly and main assembly lines. 
DOE estimates that manufacturers 
would incur approximately $111 
million in capital conversion costs to 
modify their production facilities. Some 
gas-fired storage water heater 
manufacturers stated during interviews 
that they would consider moving 
facilities offshore at TSL 7 to take 
advantage of lower labor costs. In 
addition, due to the complexity and 
large size of storage water heaters at this 
efficiency, manufacturers are concerned 
that installations will be far more 
difficult and could force many 
consumers to pay substantially higher 
installed costs if their replacement 
water heater does not fit into their 
existing space. Manufacturers are also 
concerned about profitability if 
standards were set at a level that would 
effectively require condensing 
technology. An amended energy 
conservation standard that effectively 
mandated condensing gas-fired storage 
water heaters would completely change 
the existing structure of the industry. 
Because this technology results in much 
more expensive units than the majority 
of products on the market today, 
manufacturers argued that not all of the 
increased costs could be passed on to 
the customer. In addition, the 
significantly higher production costs 
would require at least an additional 
$145 million in working capital to 
purchase significantly more expensive 
components, carry more costly 
inventory, and handle higher accounts 
receivable. DOE estimates that the 
working capital requirement and 
conversion costs would cause gas-fired 
storage water heater manufacturers to 
incur a total one-time investment of at 
least $276 million in a gas-fired storage 
market valued at approximately $532 
million. While there is a slightly 
positive impact if manufacturers get the 
same return on these investments as in 
the base case, manufacturers believe 
that they will not earn the same return 
from the substantially higher capital 
requirements at TSL 7.

TSL 1 represents an improvement in 
efficiency for oil-fired storage water 
heaters from the baseline level of 0.53 
EF to 0.58 EF for the representative 
rated storage volume of 32 gallons. At 
TSL 1, DOE estimates the impacts on 
INPV to range from ¥$0.2 to ¥$0.3 
million, or a change in INPV of ¥1.93 
percent to ¥3.89 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow would be 
expected to decrease by approximately 
28.5 percent, to $0.4 million, compared 
to the base-case value of $0.6 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. At 
TSL 1, one of the two major 
manufacturers would have to incur 
relatively small product and capital 
conversion costs to slightly modify their 
existing product line. DOE research 
suggests that this TSL can be met with 
changes to the insulation thickness of 
baseline products. However, if more 
costly design changes were required it 
could have more of an impact on the 
industry. 
TSL 2 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 0.53 
EF to 0.60 EF for the representative 
rated storage volume of 32 gallons. At 
TSL 2, DOE estimates the impacts on 
INPV to range from ¥$0.2 million to 
¥$0.3 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥1.78 percent to ¥3.58 percent. At this 
level, the industry cash flow is 
estimated to decrease by approximately 
28.5 percent, to $0.4 million, compared 
to the base-case value of $0.6 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
Similar to TSL 1, at TSL 2 DOE has 
tentatively concluded, based on a 
review of existing products on the 
market, that TSL 2 could be met with 
changes to the type and thickness of the 
insulation. The impacts at TSL 1 are 
slightly worse than at TSL 2 because the 
technology option for existing oil-fired 
storage water heaters on the market 
results in lower product costs at TSL 2. 
However, if TSL 2 is met with similar 
insulation changes, only one of two 
major manufacturers would still be 
required to slightly modify their current 
residential oil-fired storage product 
lines at TSL 2. 
TSLs 3 through TSL 6 represent an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 0.53 EF to 0.62 EF for 
the representative rated storage volume 
of 32 gallons. At these levels, DOE 
estimates the impacts on INPV to range 
from ¥$0.2 million to ¥$0.4 million, or 
a change in INPV of ¥1.96 percent to 
¥4.31 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow decreases by 
approximately 28.5 percent, to $0.4 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $0.6 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. At these TSLs, one 
major manufacturer would have to incur 
relatively minor product and capital 
conversion costs to modify their existing 
oil-fired residential storage water heater 
product line. DOE has tentatively 
concluded based on a review of existing 
products on the market that the 
efficiency requirements at TSL 3 
through TSL 6 could be met with 
changes to the type and thickness of the 
insulation. Due to the low volume of oil- 
fired storage water heaters, if any 
manufacturer had to make substantial 
product or capital conversion costs to 
reach the amended energy conservation 
standard using a more complex 
technology, these substantial costs 
could force them to consider exiting the 
residential oil-fired storage water heater 
market. 
TSL 7 (the max-tech level) represents 
an improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 0.53 EF to 0.68 EF for 
the representative rated storage volume 
of 32 gallons. At TSL 7, DOE estimates 
the impacts on INPV to range from 
¥$1.3 million to ¥$3.5 million, or a 
change in INPV of ¥14.84 percent to 
¥39.86 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 342.5 
percent, to ¥$1.3 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $0.6 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. At 
TSL 7, at least one major manufacturer 
would have to incur very substantial 
product and capital conversion to 
redesign the combustion and baffling 
system to include a multi flue design. 
Given the small size of the residential 
oil-fired storage water heater market, 
this manufacturer stated that these 
extremely large substantial product and 
capital conversion costs would be 
difficult to justify. At TSL 7, it is 
possible that this manufacturer would 
exit the residential oil-fired storage 
water heater market. Because there are 
only two main manufacturers that 
supply the vast majority of U.S. 
shipments of oil-fired storage water 
heaters, any manufacturer exiting the 
market could lead to a market 
disruption.

TSL 1 through TSL 6 represent an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline gas-fired instantaneous water 
heater efficiency level of 0.62 EF to 0.82 
EF for the representative input capacity 
of 199 kBtu/h. At TSL 1 through TSL 6, 
DOE estimates the INPV impacts to 
range from $1.2 million to ¥$1.8 
million, or a change in INPV of 0.20 
percent to ¥0.30 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
remain at the base-case value of $75.0 
million in the year leading up to the 
standards. DOE research suggests that 
over 80 percent of gas-fired 
instantaneous products sold today meet 
or exceed this efficiency, and nearly all 
manufacturers of gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters currently make products 
that meet or exceed the efficiency 
required by TSL 1 through TSL 6. 
Hence, there appears to be little risk that 
TSL 1 through TSL 6 would greatly 
harm manufacturers or reduce the 
number of manufacturers that sell these 
products. 
TSL 7 (the max-tech level) represents 
an improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 0.62 EF to 0.95 EF for 
the representative input capacity of 199 
kBtu/h. At TSL 7, DOE estimates the 
INPV impacts to range from $80.3 
million to ¥$65.9 million, or a change 
in INPV of 13.31 percent to ¥10.91 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flows are estimated to decrease by 
approximately 5.9 percent to $70.5 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $75.0 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. Only one 
manufacturer currently offers a gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater that meets 
the max-tech efficiency on the U.S. 
market. Most manufacturers would 
incur substantial product conversion 
and capital conversion costs to upgrade 
their existing products at TSL 7. To 
reach 0.95 EF, a more complex 
condensing model would need to be 
developed. Because only one 
manufacturer offers products that meet 
this efficiency, TSL 7 could greatly 
reduce the number of gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters offered for 
sale in the United States. 
b. Direct Heating Equipment Cash-Flow 
Analysis Results 
Traditional DHE manufacturers are 
extremely concerned about the potential 
for amended energy conservation 
standards to harm their business. The 
vast majority of the traditional DHE 
market is controlled by three 
manufacturers. The small shipment 
volume of products in the traditional 
market has greatly reduced the number 
of competitors in the past decade. The 
traditional DHE market is mostly a 
replacement market met by these three 
companies that have acquired product 
lines as competitors were bought and 
absorbed or exited the market. Most 
DHE manufacturers offer a wide scope 
of products manufactured at low 
production rates to ensure that they can 
maintain a viable portion of the 
replacement market in order to remain 
in business. Because the traditional DHE 
market consists of a large number of 
relatively low-volume, mostly 
replacement models, manufacturers 
stated that they cannot justify large 
investments needed to redesign their 
existing product lines. Manufacturers 
are concerned that amended energy 
conservation standards could greatly 
impact the availability of replacement 
products for the majority of their 
customers due to the limited resources 
that would be available to update 
existing products and make changes to 
their existing facilities. In addition, 
manufacturers were concerned that 
energy conservation standards could 
lower profitability at higher TSLs 
because demand is expected to decline 
in response to increases in first cost that 
could cause consumers to switch to 
other types of heating appliances. 
Gas hearth manufacturers were also 
concerned about potentially detrimental 
impacts from amended energy 
conservation standards. While there are 
three major gas hearth DHE 
manufacturers, DOE identified an 
additional 12 manufacturers in the 
market and technology assessment (see 
chapter 3 of the TSD). Because 
consumers generally are more interested 
in the appearance of these products than

efficiency, every manufacturer typically 
offers a wide range of product lines and 
an even greater number of individual 
products. Manufacturers are concerned 
that higher energy conservation 
standards could harm their business 
because they do not have the resources 
to upgrade all these existing product 
lines and could be forced to offer fewer 
products after the compliance date for 
the amended energy conservation 
standards. Manufacturers were also 
concerned that higher price points 
could lead to lower profitability. 
Because of the large number of 
manufacturers and the recent decline in 
shipments, manufacturers were 
concerned that additional production 
costs could not be passed on to 
consumers or that markups would be 
lowered to avoid higher price points 
leading to lower sales. 
To assess the lower end of the range 
of potential impacts of amended 
standards on DHE manufacturers, DOE 
modeled the industry assuming the 
preservation of return on invested 
capital scenario. Besides the impact of 
shipments and the required capital and 
product conversion costs on INPV, this 
scenario assumes that manufacturers are 
able to maintain their base-case return, 
even on additional invested capital. In 
this scenario, operating profit increases 
after the compliance date of the 
amended energy conservation standards 
because manufacturers continue to earn 
a historical rate of return on the 
investments required by the amended 
energy conservation standards. 
To assess the higher end of the range 
of potential impacts of amended 
standards on the DHE industry, DOE 
modeled the preservation of operating 
profit markup scenario. In this scenario, 
higher energy conservation standards 
result in lower manufacturer percentage 
markups. The preservation of operating 
profit markup scenario models 
manufacturers’ concerns about the low 
volume of shipments and declining 
profitability if higher energy 
conservation standards were 
implemented. The preservation of 
operating profit scenario also models 
gas hearth manufacturer concerns that 
amended energy conservation standards 
would impact profitability due to the 
need to lower their markups to keep 
customers from switching to non- 
covered hearth products if the energy 
conservation standards significantly 
raised the installed prices of covered 
products. In the preservation of 
operating profit scenario, manufacturer 
markups decline and operating profit 
remains the same after the compliance 
date of the amended energy 
conservation standards as in the base 
case. Industry value is harmed because 
manufacturers do not earn additional 
return on the investments required by 
the amended standards.

For traditional DHE, TSL 1 represents 
an improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 74-percent AFUE to 75- 
percent AFUE for gas wall fan DHE, an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 64-percent AFUE to 66- 
percent for gas wall gravity DHE, an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 57-percent AFUE to 58- 
percent AFUE for gas floor DHE (the 
max-tech level), and an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 64- 
percent AFUE to 66-percent AFUE for 
gas room DHE at their respective 
representative input rating ranges. DOE 
research suggests that manufacturers 
would use an intermittent ignition and 
a two-speed blower for gas wall fan DHE 
and an improved heat exchanger design 
for gas wall gravity, gas floor units, and 
gas room DHE to achieve the efficiencies 
required by TSL 1. At TSL 1, DOE 
estimates the impacts on INPV to range 
from $0.4 to ¥$1.6 million, or a change

in INPV of ¥2.27 percent to ¥9.11 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow is estimated to decrease by 
approximately 45.7 percent, to $0.8 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $1.4 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. While some 
manufacturers may need to make 
redesigns to some of their products even 
at TSL 1, manufacturers generally have 
a significant number of products that 
meet the required efficiencies for most 
traditional DHE product types, and for 
this reason, a complete exit from the 
market by any manufacturer is unlikely. 
TSL 2 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 74- 
percent AFUE to 76-percent for gas wall 
fan DHE, an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 64-percent 
AFUE to 68-percent AFUE for gas wall 
gravity DHE, an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 57- 
percent AFUE to 58-percent AFUE for 
gas floor DHE (the max-tech level), and 
an improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 64-percent AFUE to 67- 
percent for gas room DHE at the 
representative input rating ranges for 
each product type. DOE research 
suggests that at TSL 2, manufacturers 
would opt to use an improved heat 
exchanger and intermittent ignition for 
gas wall fan DHE, and make further 
improvements to the heat exchanger for 
gas wall gravity and gas room DHE, and 
use the same improved heat exchanger 
for gas floor DHE as at TSL 1 to reach 
the efficiency levels required by TSL 2. 
At TSL 2, DOE estimates the impacts in 
INPV to range from ¥$0.6 million to 
¥$3.1 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥3.42 percent to ¥17.20 percent. At 
this level, the industry cash flow is 
estimated to decrease by approximately 
86.1 percent, to $0.2 million, compared 
to the base-case value of $1.4 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. At 
TSL 2, every manufacturer would face 
higher product development costs in 
order to offer a similar range of product 
offerings. However, at TSL 2, it is likely 
that more products would be 
discontinued because more of the 
current products on the market fall 
below the required efficiencies. As a 
result, manufacturers must either 
expend resources to cover the necessary 
product conversion and capital 
conversion costs, or they will be forced 
to discontinue some of their existing 
product lines. While TSL 2 would have 
a significant impact on manufacturers, 
most manufacturers would not be 
expected to face a complete redesign for 
most traditional DHE product types. 
Even if manufacturers lowered the 
number of product lines offered in 
certain product classes, manufacturers 
would have enough existing products 
that meet or exceed the required 
efficiencies to upgrade most of their 
existing product lines and maintain 
viable production volumes after the 
compliance date of the amended energy 
conservation standards. 
TSL 3 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 74- 
percent AFUE to 77-percent for gas wall 
fan DHE, an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 64-percent 
AFUE to 71-percent AFUE for gas wall 
gravity units, an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 57- 
percent AFUE to 58-percent AFUE for 
gas floor DHE (the max-tech level), and 
an improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 64-percent AFUE to 68- 
percent for gas room DHE at the 
representative input rating ranges. DOE 
research suggests that manufacturers 
would improve baseline units by adding 
an intermittent ignition, a two-speed 
blower, and an improved heat 
exchanger for gas wall fan units, make 
further improvements to the heat 
exchanger used to reach TSL 2 for gas 
wall gravity and gas room units, and use 
the same improved heat exchanger for 
gas floor DHE as at TSL 1 and TSL 2 to 
reach the efficiency levels of TSL 3. At 
TSL 3, DOE estimates the INPV impacts 
to range from ¥$1.1 million to ¥$6.0 
million, or a change in INPV of ¥5.91 
percent to ¥33.54 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 161.8 
percent to ¥$0.9 million, compared to 
the base-case value of 1.4 million in the 
year leading up to the standards. The 
large estimated impact on INPV suggests 
that manufacturers would be 
substantially harmed if profitability 
were impacted. 
At TSL 3, products increasingly rely 
on purchased parts, making it more 
likely that manufacturers’ profitability 
would decline. At TSL 3, it is likely that 
some manufacturers would reduce the 
number of product lines offered in order 
to lower the product conversion and 
capital conversion costs required at TSL 
3. Discontinuing product lines would 
still have a negative impact on the 
manufacturers that selectively upgrade 
existing product lines since many 
manufacturers rely on aggregated 
production scale from all products they 
sell to secure favorable purchased part 
and raw material prices. The fixed 
portion of product conversion costs, 
such as certification and the total capital 
conversion costs, typically require a 
minimum shipment volume in order to 
be economically justifiable to the 
manufacturer. However, at TSL 3, most 
manufacturers have existing products 
that meet the required efficiencies in 
three out of the four product types of 
traditional DHE. Because manufacturers 
have a substantial number of product 
lines that meet the required efficiencies 
at TSL3, even if manufacturers 
selectively upgrade their existing 
product lines, they would be expected 
to maintain a viable production volume 
after the compliance date of the 
amended energy conservation and not 
exit the market completely. 
TSL 4 is the max-tech level for gas 
wall fan DHE. TSL 4 represents an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 74-percent AFUE to 80- 
percent for gas wall fan DHE at the 
representative input rating range. The 
efficiency requirements for gas wall 
gravity, gas floor, and gas room DHE are 
the same at TSL 4 as at TSL 3. To 
achieve the max-tech level for gas wall 
fan DHE, DOE research suggests that 
manufacturers would need to use an 
electronic ignition and induced draft. 
DOE anticipates that manufacturers 
would make the same improvements to 
the heat exchangers as necessary to 
achieve TSL 3 for gas wall gravity, gas 
floor, and gas-room DHE. At TSL 4, DOE 
estimates the INPV impacts to range 
from ¥$1.3 million to ¥$7.6 million, or 
a change in INPV of ¥7.16 percent to 
¥42.14 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 202.3 
percent to ¥$1.4 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $1.4 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
Most manufacturers’ products are 
below the max-tech level for gas wall 
fan DHE, which further increases the 
total capital and product conversion 
costs over TSL 3. At TSL 4, most 
manufacturers would have to 
completely redesign their gas wall fan 
products and purchase new tooling. The 
discrepancy between the number of unit 
shipments and the number of product 
lines requiring significant product 
development to meet the potential 
energy conservation standards is a large 
driver of the negative impacts at TSL 4. 
When faced with these substantial costs, 
most manufacturers would likely 
discontinue products in this product 
class or possibly exit the market 
altogether. In addition, at TSL 4 every 
manufacturer would face significant 
conversion costs in every product type, 
making it much more likely that the 
industry would offer far fewer products 
and that the industry would have fewer 
competitors after the compliance date of 
amended standards. Besides the 
likelihood of multiple manufacturers 
discontinuing product lines or exiting 
the market, the large impact on INPV 
shows that manufacturers would also be

substantially harmed if profitability 
were impacted for existing or 
redesigned products. 
TSL 5 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 74- 
percent AFUE to 75-percent AFUE for 
gas wall fan DHE, an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 64- 
percent AFUE to 72-percent AFUE for 
gas wall gravity units (the max-tech 
level), an improvement in efficiency 
from the baseline level of 57-percent 
AFUE to 58-percent AFUE for gas floor 
DHE (the max-tech level), and an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 64-percent AFUE to 83- 
percent AFUE (the max-tech level) for 
gas room DHE at the representative 
input rating ranges for each product 
type. To achieve the efficiencies 
required by TSL 5, DOE research 
suggests that manufacturers would need 
to use an intermittent ignition and a 
two-speed blower for gas wall fan DHE, 
use an electronic ignition for gas wall 
gravity DHE, use an improved heat 
exchanger for gas floor DHE, and use 
electronic ignition and a multiple heat 
exchanger design for gas room DHE. At 
TSL 5, DOE estimates the impacts on 
INPV to range from ¥$1.8 million to 
¥$8.0 million, or a change in INPV of 
¥9.99 percent to ¥44.84 percent. At 
this level, the industry cash flow is 
estimated to decrease by approximately 
195.5 percent, to ¥$1.3 million, 
compared to the base-case value of $1.4 
million in the year leading up to the 
standards. 
Most traditional DHE models 
available on the market today are below 
the max-tech level for gas wall gravity 
and gas room DHE, which leads to 
higher total capital and product 
conversion costs and more negative 
impacts on INPV at TSL 5 than TSL 4. 
DOE research suggests that at TSL 5, 
most manufacturers would have to 
completely redesign and buy new 
tooling in order to offer gas wall gravity 
and gas room products at these 
efficiency levels. The small number of 
unit shipments and the large number of 
product lines that would require 
significant product development to meet 
the energy conservation standards is a 
large driver of the negative impacts at 
TSL 5. Hence, the potential number of 
product lines being discontinued and 
the number of manufacturers exiting the 
market at TSL 5 would be expected to 
be greater than at TSL 4, with even 
greater repercussions on consumer 
choice, employment, and competition. 
TSL 6 is set at the max-tech level for 
all traditional DHE product classes. The 
efficiency requirements for gas wall 
gravity, gas floor, and gas room DHE are 
the same at TSL 6 as at TSL 5. However, 
TSL 6 also represents an improvement 
from 75-percent to 80-percent AFUE for 
gas wall fan DHE (the max-tech level). 
To achieve the max-tech level for gas 
wall fan DHE, DOE research suggests 
that manufacturers would need to use 
an electronic ignition and induced draft. 
As to the other products, DOE 
anticipates that manufacturers would 
need to use an electronic ignition for gas 
wall gravity DHE, use an improved heat 
exchanger for gas floor DHE, and use 
electronic ignition and a multiple heat 
exchanger design for gas room DHE. At 
the max-tech TSL (TSL 6), DOE 
estimates the INPV impacts to range 
from ¥$2.2 million to ¥$10.8 million, 
or a change in INPV of ¥12.28 percent 
to ¥59.98. At this level, the industry 
cash flow is estimated to decrease by 
approximately 269.5 percent to ¥$2.4 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $1.4 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. Most products 
currently available are below the max- 
tech level for all product classes. At the 
max-tech level, most manufacturers 
would be faced with complete product 
redesigns for almost all product lines 
and significant plant changes to remain 
in the market. Most manufacturers 
would be expected to discontinue 
products or exit the market altogether. 
Due to the low volume of shipments in 
the industry, it unlikely that any 
manufacturer could offer close to the 
range of products currently offered 
today. Hence, some product classes may 
cease to be commercially available. It is 
very likely that multiple manufacturers 
would exit the market at the max-tech 
level for every product class.

TSL 1 through TSL 3 represents an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 64-percent AFUE to 67- 
percent AFUE for gas hearth DHE at the 
27,000 Btu/h to 46,000 Btu/h 
representative input rating range. To 
reach 67-percent AFUE from baseline 
efficiency, manufacturers would likely 
use an electronic ignition. At TSL 1 
through TSL 3, DOE estimates the 
impacts on INPV to range from ¥$0.2 
million to ¥$0.9 million, or a change in 
INPV of ¥0.22 percent to ¥1.07 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow is estimated to decrease by 
approximately 7.6 percent, to $2.6 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $2.8 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. Most manufacturers 
offer multiple products that meet this 
efficiency level. Because there are so 
many product lines at the baseline 
efficiency, however, there could be 
fairly substantial product conversion 
costs at this TSL because manufacturers 
would have to slightly redesign all of 
the baseline products. In addition, some 
manufacturers could be required to 
make other minor changes to their 
production lines to accommodate other 
improvements such as additional 
baffling. DOE research suggests that 
such changes may be inexpensive since 
they would not require the industry to 
replace major hard tooling at TSL 1 
through TSL 3. Because of the small 
change in product costs at TSL 1 
through TSL 3, it is unlikely that 
manufacturer profitability would 
decrease appreciably to maintain the 
existing shipments. 
TSL 4 and TSL 5 represent an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 64-percent AFUE to 72- 
percent AFUE for gas hearth DHE at the 
27,000 Btu/h to 46,000 Btu/h 
representative input rating range. DOE 
research suggests that fan-assisted gas 
hearth DHE products could reach 72- 
percent AFUE from baseline efficiency. 
At TSL 4 and TSL 5, DOE estimates the 
impacts on INPV to range from $2.4 
million to ¥$14.8 million, or a change 
in INPV of 2.80 percent to ¥17.13 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow is estimated to decrease by 
approximately 19.9 percent, to $2.3 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $2.8 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. At TSL 4 and TSL 
5, gas hearth manufacturers would 
likely reduce the scope of their product 
offerings to lower the required 
conversion costs to comply with the 
energy conservation standard. Many of 
the smaller manufacturers could 
consider existing the market when faced 
with fairly substantial product and 
capital conversion costs that are not 
justified by their shipment volumes. 
Much of the capital conversion costs are 
expected to involve changes to handle 
new materials like additional insulation 
and baffling, changes to the heat shields, 
and new stamping dies for many 
manufacturers that need to greatly alter 
their existing designs. Manufacturers 
will also incur additional product 
conversion costs for product 
development and certification because 
most products currently sold would not 
meet the efficiency requirements of TSL 
4 and TSL 5. While most of the changes 
above the baseline require 
manufacturers to purchase or 
manufacture more costly components 
that increase MPC, the resulting higher 
MSPs also concerned manufacturers. 
Manufacturers stated that the market is 
very price sensitive, so any increase in 
unit price could invariably lead to fewer 
sales. Hence, manufacturers expect that 
the industry would have to lower its 
profit margins in order to reduce 
shipments impacts that could result 
from cost increases related to potential 
energy efficiency improvements. 
TSL 6 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 64- 
percent AFUE to 93-percent AFUE for 
gas hearth DHE at the 27,000 Btu/h to 
46,000 Btu/h representative input rating 
range. To reach 93-percent AFUE from 
the baseline efficiency, manufacturers 
would need to use a condensing design. 
At the max-tech TSL (TSL 6), DOE 
estimates the impacts on INPV to range 
from $10.2 million to ¥$55.1 million, 
or a change in INPV of 11.82 percent to 
¥63.83 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 128.8 
percent, to ¥$0.8 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $2.8 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
At TSL 6, manufacturers indicated 
they would greatly reduce the scope of 
their product offerings to lower the 
required costs to comply with an 
amended energy conservation standard 
at this level. Because there are very few 
products on the market today that use 
this technology, the product 
development costs greatly increase at 
this TSL. DOE research suggests that 
manufacturers would likely need a 
secondary heat exchanger at the max- 
tech level, which could alter the size 
and structure of most existing product 
lines. Manufacturers expressed concern 
regarding their ability to use existing 
tooling and equipment, much of which 
may become obsolete when hearths 
have to be redesigned from the ground 
up to accommodate the efficiency 
requirements at this level. It is also very 
likely that many of the 10 small 
business manufacturers could be forced 
to exit the market when faced with these 
substantial conversion costs since they 
do not have the access to capital, the 
product development resources, or the 
shipment volumes to justify these 
conversion costs. 
Manufacturers also stated that they 
were concerned about consumer utility 
issues at TSL 6. Smaller units would 
likely be significantly impacted at this 
TSL because the low inherent interior 
volume makes it much more difficult to 
accommodate a secondary heat 
exchanger without narrowing the area 
available for the logs and flame. 
Manufacturers also indicated that it gets 
progressively more difficult to imitate a 
natural, wood-burning flame appearance 
at this efficiency level, which could hurt 
sales and reduce consumer utility. 
Finally, manufacturers were concerned 
that the MPCs at the max-tech level are 
estimated to be more than double the 
baseline costs for the representative 
input rating range. In order to maintain 
shipments of gas hearth DHE with 
substantially higher costs and potential 
consumer utility impacts, manufacturers 
believe that profitability would be 
greatly impacted.

conservation standards could cause 
significant harm to their industry, 
because pool heaters are a luxury item 
and have low annual usage that would 
prevent the majority of consumers from 
recouping the greater initial price at 
higher efficiencies. Since pool heaters 
are considered a luxury product, 
manufacturers expect sales to decline as 
unit costs increase. As the required 
efficiencies approach a condensing 
technology, manufacturers would have 
to make more substantial changes to 
their existing products that add 
significant costs that would encourage 
repair instead of replacement of failed 
units, cause fuel switching (e.g., to heat 
pumps or solar systems), or make 
customers abandon heating their pool 
altogether. 
To assess the lower end of the range 
of potential impacts on pool heater 
manufacturers, DOE modeled the 
preservation of return on invested 
capital markup scenario. Besides the 
impact of changes in shipments on 
INPV and the required capital and 
product conversion costs, this case 
represents the lower end of the potential 
impacts on manufacturers because it 
assumes that manufacturers would earn 
a similar return on the investments 
required by amended energy 
conservation standards. To assess the 
higher end of the range of potential 
impacts on pool heater manufacturers, 
DOE modeled the preservation of 
operating profit markup scenario (i.e., 
constant absolute profit, regardless of 
cost increases, which leads to declining 
profit margins at higher costs). This 
scenario models manufacturers 
concerns that margins would be harmed 
at higher price points because they 
expect to lower their profit margins to 
minimize impacts due to lower sales.

TSL 1 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 78- 
percent thermal efficiency to 81-percent 
thermal efficiency for the representative 
input rating of 250,000 Btu/h. At TSL 1, 
DOE estimates the INPV impacts to 
range from $0.1 million to ¥$0.2 
million, or a change in INPV of 0.13 
percent to ¥0.29 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow would not be 
expected to change from the base-case 
value of $2.7 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. Over 60 percent of 
current gas-fired pool heaters meet or 
exceed the efficiency requirements at 
TSL 1. DOE research suggests that 
changes to the heat exchanger would 
allow baseline products to meet TSL 1. 
These changes would not require major 
modifications to existing units, resulting 
in minimal impacts to manufacturers at 
TSL 1. 
TSL 2 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 78- 
percent thermal efficiency to 82-percent 
thermal efficiency for the representative 
input rating of 250,000 Btu/h. At TSL 2, 
DOE estimates the INPV impacts to 
range from $0.4 to ¥$1.0 million, or a 
change in INPV of 0.66 percent to ¥1.66 
percent. At this level, the industry cash 
flow is expected to decrease by 
approximately 3.9 percent to $2.6 
million, compared to the base-case 
value of $2.7 million in the year leading 
up to the standards. Almost half of the 
pool heaters currently are sold at or 
above this efficiency level, and nearly 
all manufacturers make products that 
can achieve the efficiency required at 
TSL 2. DOE research suggests that minor 
improvements to heat exchangers and 
insulation surrounding the combustion 
chamber would need to be made to 
convert lower-efficiency units to this 
efficiency, causing manufacturers to 
incur small capital conversion costs. 
However, because the basic designs of 
atmospheric pool heaters that comprise 
the majority of current shipments 
remain relatively unchanged at TSL 2, 
there are minimal impacts on 
manufacturers.

TSL 3 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 78- 
percent thermal efficiency to 83-percent 
thermal efficiency for the representative 
input rating of 250,000 Btu/h. At TSL 3, 
DOE estimates the INPV impacts to 
range from ¥$0.2 to ¥$5.6 million, or 
a change in INPV of ¥0.39 percent to 
¥9.06 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 43.0 percent 
to $1.6 million, compared to the base- 
case value of $2.7 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. DOE 
research suggests that most 
manufacturers would have to improve 
some of their product lines to reach an 
83-percent thermal efficiency by using 
power venting technology. DOE 
research also suggests that while the 
manufacturing production costs are not 
expected to increase significantly, most 
manufacturers would incur some 
product and capital conversion costs to 
increase their production of existing 
lower volume products at TSL 3. TSL 3 
would eliminate most common 
atmospheric models on the market 
today, which could hurt profitability if 
consumer demand for gas-fired pool 
heaters holds at its current level despite 
the higher production costs at this TSL. 
TSL 4 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 78- 
percent thermal efficiency to 84-percent 
thermal efficiency for the representative 
input rating of 250,000 Btu/h. At TSL 4, 
DOE estimates the INPV impacts to 
range from $0.5 million to ¥$7.5 
million, or a change in INPV of 0.88 
percent to ¥12.15 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 45.9 percent 
to $1.5 million, compared to the base- 
case value of $2.7 million in the year 
leading up to the standards. Similar to 
TSL 3, TSL 4 would require fairly 
substantial capital and product 
conversion costs. Because this efficiency 
level eliminates all atmospheric models 
that are currently on the market and 
requires additional improvements over 
TSL 3, the capital conversion costs are 
even higher at TSL 4. DOE research 
suggests that manufacturers would have 
to design products that use power 
venting and an improved heat 
exchanger, which could be costly to 
develop. Manufacturers stated that the 
high component costs at TSL 4 would 
result in substantially higher costs for 
consumers. The higher production costs 
and conversion costs make it more 
likely that manufacturers’ concerns 
about reduced profitability would be 
realized at TSL 4. 
TSL 5 represents an improvement in 
efficiency from the baseline level of 78- 
percent thermal efficiency to 86-percent 
thermal efficiency for the representative 
input rating of 250,000 Btu/h. At TSL 5, 
DOE estimates the INPV impacts to 
range from $3.1 million to ¥$19.5 
million, or a change in INPV of 5.03 
percent to ¥31.82 percent. At this level, 
the industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 108.9 
percent to ¥$0.2 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $2.7 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
Over 90 percent of current shipments 
are below this efficiency level. 
Manufacturers would incur significant 
conversion costs at TSL 5 and would 
likely significantly reduce the scope of 
their product offerings. DOE research 
suggests that manufacturers would 
switch remaining units to sealed 
combustion systems and improved heat 
exchanger designs, adding substantial 
production cost and eliminating 
unpowered units from the market. 
Manufacturers believe that consumers 
would look for alternatives to gas-fired 
pool heaters or not replace failed units 
due to the higher product costs that 
would result from an amended energy 
conservation standard at TSL 5. 
Manufacturers also indicated that 
problems at efficiencies they consider 
near-condensing could force some 
companies to only offer fully 
condensing units with even greater 
negative paybacks for consumers. A 
further concern of manufacturers relates 
to the current installer and maintenance 
base for pool heaters, which would 
require significant additional training to 
be able to properly install, troubleshoot, 
and service increasingly complex pool 
heaters. 
TSL 6 (max-tech level) represents an 
improvement in efficiency from the 
baseline level of 78-percent thermal 
efficiency to 95-percent thermal 
efficiency for the representative input 
rating of 250,000 Btu/h. At TSL 6, DOE 
estimates the INPV impacts to range 
from $12.9 million to ¥$44.5 million, 
or a change in INPV of 20.96 percent to 
¥72.59 percent. At this level, the 
industry cash flow is estimated to 
decrease by approximately 157.2 
percent to ¥$1.6 million, compared to 
the base-case value of $2.7 million in 
the year leading up to the standards. 
Almost all gas-fired pool heaters 
currently on the market are well below 
this efficiency level. Manufacturers 
would face significant conversion costs 
at TSL 6 in order to develop condensing 
systems or refine existing designs to 
achieve lower cost condensing pool 
heaters. DOE research suggests that heat 
exchanger materials would need to 
withstand acidic condensate created by 
condensing pool heaters. In light of 
strong concerns about consumer 
reaction to a substantially-increased first 
cost at TSL 6, manufacturers do not 
believe this efficiency level could be 
justified for residential pool heater 
consumers due to low usage and 
significantly higher costs. 
Manufacturers believe that consumers 
would not be willing to purchase such 
an expensive product and would either 
find an alternative to gas-fired pool 
heaters or no longer purchase a gas-fired 
pool heater. In addition, at TSL 6 
manufacturers are also concerned about 
the industry’s ability to educate and 
retrain installers and servicers of pool 
heaters in time for the compliance date 
of the standard. Condensing units with 
sealed combustion are more complex 
than the vast majority of atmospheric 
units on the market today and would 
require significant additional training 
for safe installation and maintenance. 
Manufacturers also expect product 
support costs to increase significantly as 
complexity increases the likelihood and 
frequency of events such as component 
failures and unit lockouts that would 
require manufacturer support and 
servicing, as well as increased warranty 
costs. Besides increasing warranty costs 
for manufacturers, the issues and costs 
associated with proper unit 
maintenance post-warranty could 
potentially cause them to switch fuel 
sources (e.g., switching to heat pump or 
solar water heaters) or abandon pool 
heating altogether. 
d. Impacts on Employment 
DOE quantitatively assessed the 
impacts of potential amended energy 
conservation standards on employment 
for each of the three types of heating 
products that are the subject of this 
rulemaking. DOE used the GRIM to 
estimate the domestic labor 
expenditures and number of domestic 
production workers in the base case and 
at each TSL from 2008 to 2045 for the 
residential water heater industry and 
from 2008 to 2043 for the DHE and pool 
heater industries. DOE used statistical 
data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the 
results of the engineering analysis, and 
interviews with manufacturers to 
determine the inputs necessary to 
calculate industry-wide labor 
expenditures and domestic employment 
levels. Labor expenditures are a 
function of the labor intensity of the 
equipment, the sales volume, and an 
assumption that wages remain fixed in 
real terms over time. 
In each GRIM, DOE used the labor 
content of each product and the 
manufacturing production costs from 
the engineering analysis to estimate the 
annual labor expenditures in the

residential water heater, DHE, and pool 
heater industries. DOE used Census data 
and interviews with manufacturers to 
estimate the portion of the total labor 
expenditures that is for U.S. (i.e., 
domestic) labor. 
The estimates of production workers 
in this section only cover workers up to 
the line-supervisor level that are 
directly involved in fabricating and 
assembling a product within the 
Original Equipment Manufacturer 
(OEM) facility. Workers that perform 
services that are closely associated with 
production operations, such as material 
handing with a forklift, are also 
included as production labor. DOE’s 
estimates only account for production 
workers that manufacture the specific 
products covered by this rulemaking. 
For example, a worker on a commercial 
water heater line would not be included 
with the estimate of the number of 
residential water heater production 
workers. 
The employment impacts shown in 
Table V.30 through Table V.34 represent 
the potential production employment 
that could result following amended 
energy conservation standards. The 
upper end of the results in these tables 
estimates the maximum potential 
increase in production workers after 
amended energy conservation 
standards. The upper end of the results 
assumes manufacturers would continue 
to produce the same scope of covered 
products in the same production 
facilities. The upper end of the range 
also assumes that domestic production 
is not shifted to lower-labor-cost 
countries. Because there is a real risk of 
manufacturers exiting the market or no 
longer offering the same scope of 
covered products in response to 
amended energy conservation 
standards, the lower end of the range of 
employment results in Table V.30 
through Table V.34 include the estimate 
of the total number of U.S. production 
workers in the industry that could lose 
their job if all existing production were 
to no longer be made domestically. 
While the results present a range of 
employment impacts following the 
compliance date of amended energy 
conservation standards, the discussion 
below also includes a qualitative 
discussion of the likelihood of negative 
employment impacts at the various 
TSLs. Finally, the employment impacts 
shown are independent of the 
employment impacts from the broader 
U.S. economy, which are documented 
in chapter 15, Employment Impact 
Analysis, of the NOPR TSD. 
i. Gas-Fired and Electric Storage Water 
Heater Employment Impacts 
Using the GRIM, DOE estimates that 
would be 3,690 domestic gas-fired and 
electric storage water heater production 
workers in 2015 without amended 
energy conservation standards. Using 
Census Bureau data and interviews with 
manufacturers, DOE estimates that 
approximately two-thirds of gas-fired 
and electric storage water heaters sold 
in the United States are manufactured 
domestically. Table V.30 shows the 
range of the impacts of potential 
amended energy conservation standards 
on U.S. production workers in the gas- 
fired and electric storage water heater 
market.

* DOE presents a range of potential employment impacts. Numbers in parentheses indicate negative numbers. 
During manufacturer interviews, gas- 
fired and electric storage water heater 
manufacturers stated that they expect 
employment levels to remain relatively 
constant at TSL 1 through TSL 4. At 
these TSLs, baseline gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters would be 
improved by increasing the insulation 
thickness around the tank. These 
improvements would not greatly alter 
the manufacturing process and are not 
likely to significantly change 
employment levels. 
At TSL 5, domestic employment 
would be likely to increase if 
manufacturers built their dedicate heat 
pump line for large rated storage 
volumes in the United States. However, 
because the labor content to assemble 
fully integrated heat pump water heaters 
is much higher than most models 
currently on the market, manufacturers 
could also decide to build these lines in 
existing overseas production facilities. 
At TSL 5, the sourcing decisions would 
also impact the likely employment 
impacts. If manufacturers built a 
dedicated condensing line for large 
rated storage volumes in the United 
States, domestic employment could 
increase. 
TSL 6 and TSL 7 could also impact 
domestic gas-fired and electric storage 
water heater employment. These TSLs 
effectively would require the use of 
integrated heat pump water heater 
technology for electric storage water 
heaters for all rate volumes. 
Manufacturers stated that at these 
levels, they initially would expect to 
purchase fully-assembled heat pump 
modules from off-shore suppliers 
because they do not have the 
manufacturing experience or the space 
in their existing facilities to 
accommodate assembling the heat hump 
modules. Once purchased, 
manufacturers would attach the 
modules to water heaters on lines 
modified to accommodate the very 
different assembly and testing

requirements of heat pump water 
heaters. While the industry typically has 
manufacturing facilities with a mix of 
dedicated and non-dedicated assembly 
lines by fuel type, flexible assembly 
lines may have to be discontinued at 
TSL 6, because heat pump water heaters 
are top-heavy, take longer to test, and 
take significantly longer to assemble 
than electric storage water heaters that 
use resistance-heater elements. Present 
facilities would likely need line 
extensions to accommodate the 
additional labor required for assembling 
heat pump water heaters. Therefore, if 
manufacturers source the heat pump 
modules and continue to assemble 
electric storage water heaters in their 
existing facilities, it is likely that 
employment would increase. However, 
the expected increase in the labor 
required to manufacture heat pump 
water heaters may also accelerate the 
trend of water heater manufacturers 
locating new production facilities 
outside the United States, especially if 
a manufacturer decides to assemble heat 
pump modules in-house. Because TSL 7 
requires additional improvements over 
TSL 6, the potential positive impacts on 
employment at TSL 7 are greater if 
manufacturers do not relocate because 
the additional improvements also 
require more labor. 
At TSL 7 (the max-tech level) gas- 
fired storage water heaters would have 
to operate in a fully-condensing mode. 
DOE research suggests that condensing 
gas-fired water heaters would be more 
complex than standard power-vent 
products and less efficient products and 
therefore would require additional labor 
to assemble. If manufacturers did not 
change their sourcing decisions at TSL 
7, it is likely there would be positive 
employment impacts for gas-fired 
storage water heaters. 
ii. Oil-Fired Storage Water Heater 
Employment Impacts 
Using the GRIM, DOE estimates there 
would be 38 oil-fired storage water 
heater production workers in the U.S. in 
2015 in the absence of amended energy 
conservation standards. Using the 
Census data and interviews with 
manufacturers, DOE estimates that 
approximately 95 percent of oil-fired 
water heaters sold in the United States 
are manufactured domestically. Table 
V.31 shows the impacts of amended 
energy conservation standards on U.S. 
production workers in the oil-fired 
water heater market.

PRODUCTION WORKERS IN 2015

*DOE presents a range of potential employment impacts. Numbers in parentheses indicate negative numbers. 
At TSL 1 through TSL 6, DOE does 
not expect substantial changes to 
domestic employment in the oil-fired 
storage water heater market if 
manufacturers are able to use the 
insulation type and thickness 
technology options in the engineering 
analysis to reach the efficiency 
requirements at these TSLs. At TSL 7, 
DOE research suggests that if all current 
suppliers continue to compete, domestic 
employment would likely increase 
slightly, because the non-proprietary, 
higher-efficiency heat exchangers 
required to reach this TSL would also 
require more labor to assemble. 
However, given the size of the oil-fired 
storage water heater market and the 
expected product conversion costs, 
companies that do not currently make 
oil-fired storage water heaters at these 
efficiency levels could exit the market. 
If the remaining manufacturers do not 
need to increase employment levels to 
meet the total market demand, 
employment in the residential oil-fired 
market could decline. 
iii. Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water 
Heater Employment Impacts 
DOE’s research suggests that currently 
no gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
are made domestically. All 
manufacturers or their domestic 
distributors do maintain offices in the 
United States to handle technical 
support, training, certification, and 
other requirements. However, as 
amended energy conservation standards 
for instantaneous water heaters are 
raised, the additional complexity of 
standards-compliant water heaters may 
require additional training and field 
support, thereby resulting in higher 
employment levels. Thus domestic 
employment may increase marginally 
due to amended energy conservation 
standards. 
iv. Traditional Direct Heating 
Equipment Employment Impacts 
Using the GRIM, DOE estimates there 
would be 300 traditional DHE 
production workers in the U.S. in 2013 
in the absence of amended energy 
conservation standards. Using the 
Census Bureau data and interviews with 
manufacturers, DOE estimates that 
approximately 100 percent of the 
traditional DHE sold in the United 
States is manufactured domestically. 
Table V.32 shows the impacts of 
amended energy conservation standards 
on U.S. production workers in the 
traditional DHE market.

*DOE presents a range of potential employment impacts. Numbers in parentheses indicate negative numbers. 
There could be negative employment 
impacts for DHE at any of the 
considered TSLs if manufacturers’ 
expectations are realized regarding 
higher prices yielding reduced demand. 
Besides increasing component costs, 
more stringent TSLs put additional 
pressure on manufacturers that could 
require them to invest in low-volume 
products, discontinue product lines that 
do not meet the required efficiency 
level, or exit the market altogether. 
While multiple manufacturers could 
be adversely affected by amended 
energy conservation standards, at TSL 1 
and TSL2, most businesses have 
existing products in at least three of the 
four traditional DHE product types. If 
manufacturers chose to expand 
production of those products that meet 
the required efficiencies, employment 
could increase. However, multiple small 
businesses would be adversely affected 
at any TSL and could decide to 
discontinue some product lines rather 
than invest in product lines with very 
low volumes. Any manufacturer that 
decided to discontinue product lines 
could reduce total employment within 
the industry if it impacted the 
availability of substitute replacement 
products. Net employment impacts if 
manufacturers discontinued product 
lines at TSL 1 and TSL 2 would depend 
on total product demand and the source 
of replacement production labor. At TSL 
3 and above, products become 
increasingly more complex, require 
higher capital and product conversion 
costs, and, hence, are likely to lead to 
the discontinuation of more product 
lines. Additionally, every manufacturer 
would face product conversion costs 
that required a complete redesign for at 
least one product class at TSL 3 and 
above. An amended energy conservation 
standard at TSL 3 and above could 
cause small businesses to exit the 
market completely or stop producing 
certain product classes. If small and 
large manufacturers discontinued 
product lines or exited the market, 
domestic employment would be 
impacted if replacements were not 
available or a manufacturer exited the 
market and its market share was not 
captured by another manufacturer. 
v. Gas Hearth Direct Heating Equipment 
Employment Impacts 
Using the GRIM, DOE estimates there 
would be 1,243 gas hearth DHE 
production workers in the U.S. in 2013 
in the absence of amended energy 
conservation standards. Based upon 
interviews with manufacturers, DOE 
estimates that approximately 80 percent 
of gas hearth DHE sold in the United 
States is manufactured domestically. 
Table V.33 shows the impacts of 
potential amended energy conservation 
standards on U.S. production workers in 
the gas hearth DHE market.

PRODUCTION WORKERS IN 2013

* DOE presents a range of potential employment impacts. Numbers in parentheses indicate negative numbers. 
DOE does not expect significant 
employment impacts at TSL 1 through 
TSL 3. A substantial portion of the 
industry already has products that meet 
the requisite efficiencies required by 
these TSLs and DOE research suggests 
manufacturers can make products at 
these TSLs by replacing standing pilot 
ignition systems with electronic ignition 
systems. For TSL 4 through TSL 6, 
manufacturers would be increasingly 
likely to exit the market or reduce their 
product offerings. At TSL 4 and TSL 5, 
air circulating blowers are required and, 
at TSL 6, condensing operation is 
required, making these products 
increasingly complex. At these levels, 
manufacturers suggested the size of the 
gas hearth DHE market covered by 
today’s rulemaking could be impacted 
due possible consumer reactions, which 
could also put additional pressure on 
domestic firms to consolidate or exit the 
market. A smaller market could reduce 
employment if the higher labor content 
required to manufacturer standards- 
compliant products is more than offset 
by a decline industry sales. 
vi. Gas-Fired Pool Heater Employment 
Impacts 
Using the GRIM, DOE estimates there 
would be 644 gas-fired pool heater 
production workers in the U.S. in 2013 
in the absence of amended energy 
conservation standards. Using the 
Census Bureau data and interviews with 
manufacturers, DOE estimates that 
approximately 100 percent of gas-fired 
pool heaters sold in the United States 
are manufactured domestically. Table 
V.34 shows the impacts of potential 
amended energy conservations 
standards on U.S. production workers in 
the gas-fired pool heater industry.

* DOE presents a range of potential employment impacts. Numbers in parentheses indicate negative numbers. 
DOE expects no significant direct 
employment impacts on gas-fired pool 
heater manufacturers for TSL 1 through 
TSL 4 because the technology options at 
these TSLs involve mostly component 
changes that do not greatly alter the 
labor content. For example, the 
technology changes for existing 
products that meet TSL 3 and TSL 4 
involve power venting. While this 
technology would alter the installation 
of much of the installed base and cause 
manufacturers to increase the 
production of low-volume products, the 
basic assembly of the pool heaters at the 
point of manufacture is not substantially 
changed. Therefore, it is unlikely that 
employment levels would be 
substantially impacted. However, the 
existing products in the market at TSL 
5 are near-condensing products and 
products at TSL 6 use fully condensing 
technology. The higher-efficiency 
products are typically more complex 
and take longer to assemble, resulting in 
an increase in employment if shipments 
levels are maintained. However, 
manufacturers have stated that the 
higher prices of higher-efficiency 
products could result in a smaller 
number of annual shipments, which 
could cause a corresponding reduction 
in industry employment as well. At TSL 
5 and TSL 6, manufacturers are 
particularly concerned that the closer 
their products become to condensing 
technology, the higher the product costs 
would be and the more likely it is that 
amended energy conservation standards 
would cause a drop in industry-wide 
shipments. If manufacturers 
experienced a drop in total shipments, 
the domestic employment in the gas- 
fired pool heater industry could be 
negatively affected. 
e. Impacts on Manufacturing Capacity 
i. Residential Gas-Fired and Electric 
Storage Water Heaters 
Amended energy conservation 
standards could cause short-term 
capacity constraints for gas-fired storage 
water heaters at TSL 7 and cause short- 
term capacity constraints for electric 
storage water heaters at TSL 6 and 
TSL 7. However, for the remaining 
TSLs, manufacturers could maintain 
capacity levels and continue to meet 
market demand under amended energy 
conservation standards. 
DOE research suggests for the 
efficiency requirements for gas-fired 
storage water heaters could be met by 
adding more foam insulation to all 
volume sizes at TSL 1 through TSL 4 
and TSL 6. These changes would not 
require gas-fired storage water heater 
manufacturers to greatly alter their 
existing production facilities or 
equipment and would not cause 
capacity constraints. DOE also 
acknowledges that TSL 5 could also 
result in a constrained market for large 
volume sizes if manufacturers do not 
make the required investments to offer 
gas-fired condensing water heaters at 
relatively low shipment volumes. DOE 
also recognizes there will likely be 
significant impacts on manufacturers at 
any TSL that effectively requires gas- 
fired condensing. 
The dramatically different technology 
required at the max-tech level for gas- 
fired storage water heaters introduces 
problems that could cause short-term 
capacity constraints in the market. At 
TSL 7 (the max-tech level), all 
manufacturers would need to redesign 
all of their existing products because 
none currently offers residential water 
heaters that use condensing technology. 
Manufacturers would also have to 
retrain their installers and servicers to 
handle technology that varies 
tremendously from the majority of 
exiting products on the market. The 
fundamental fabrication and production 
equipment of gas-fired storage water 
heaters are substantially different for 
water heaters that use condensing 
technology. Equipment to manufacturer 
required heat exchangers and new tank 
designs would be required, as well as 
substantial changes to all subassembly 
and main assembly lines to handle the 
new technology. DOE estimates that 
manufacturers would incur over $110 
million in capital conversion costs to 
make these plant modifications if all 
residential gas-fired storage water 
heaters required condensing technology. 
For comparison, the base-case estimate 
for the net PPE for gas-fired storage 
water heaters is approximately $166 
million. This comparison of the estimate 
of current net PPE to the required 
capital conversion costs indicates the 
plant and equipment changes require 
manufacturers to almost completely 
modify or replace a substantial portion 
of their existing production assets for 
gas-fired storage water heaters. DOE also 
estimates that these changes would 
strand approximately $26 million of 
existing assists, mainly the book value 
of tank and coil equipment that can no 
longer be used with condensing 
technology. In addition, manufacturers 
believe that there could be problems 
with quality control to manufacture 
substantially more complex products on 
high-speed production lines. These 
problems could further increase the 
capital costs required if the line rates 
required manufacturers to install 
additional production lines. 
Manufacturers indicated that these 
potential problems and the extremely 
substantial changes that are required to 
their facilities could cause a constrained 
market until the production equipment 
is installed and the high-speed 
manufacturing of what are currently 
low-volume commercial products can 
be expanded to meet the demand of the 
gas-fired residential water heater 
market. Although these changes are 
substantial, DOE believes that the 5-year 
period before compliance with the 
standard is required would allow 
manufacturers sufficient time to make 
the necessary changes to meet demand 
for those products. The full range of 
products may not be available initially, 
however, since manufacturers would 
likely prioritize high-volume product 
lines ahead of lower-volume product 
lines. 
For electric storage water heaters, TSL 
1 through TSL 3 would require only 
minor changes to existing products to 
increase the tank insulation thickness. 
At TSL 4, more substantial plant 
modifications would be required 
because changes to the insulation 
thickness would require more foaming 
stations and additional production lines 
due to a lower throughput. However, 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 20:45 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00101 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\11DEP2.SGM 11DEP2jle

electric storage water heater 
manufacturers would be able to 
maintain manufacturing capacity levels 
and continue to meet market demand 
under amended energy conservation 
standards for these TSLs. These TSLs do 
not require prohibitively costly or 
complex changes to existing facilities or 
most products on the market today. 
DOE also acknowledges that TSL 5 
could also result in a constrained 
market for large volume sizes if 
manufacturers do not make the required 
investments to offer electric heat pump 
water heaters at relatively low shipment 
volumes. DOE also recognizes there will 
likely be significant impacts on 
manufacturers at any TSL that 
effectively requires electric heat pump 
water heaters. 
Electric storage water heater 
manufacturers indicated that there 
could be potential capacity impacts at 
TSL 6 or TSL 7, which would effectively 
require heat pump technology. 
However, manufacturers of electric 
storage water heaters indicated that 
significant changes to production 
facilities would be required if amended 
energy conservation standards 
effectively mandated heat pump water 
heaters for all rated volume sizes (TSL 
6 and TSL 7). Several manufacturers 
stated that they could move all or part 
of their production to Mexico to take 
advantage of lower labor costs if more 
complex heat pump water heaters were 
required. DOE believes manufacturers 
would likely source the heat pump 
module initially if they were required to 
exclusively manufacture heat pump 
water heaters. However, such a dramatic 
increase in the demand for heat pump 
modules could strain suppliers, 
especially in the short-term. Finally, 
manufacturers also stated that they have 
very little experience with 
manufacturing heat pump water heaters. 
Manufacturers indicated that the 
changes to their facilities (including 
potential plant sourcing decisions) 
could cause a constrained market until 
the production equipment is installed 
and any problems with high-speed 
manufacturing are resolved. As 
discussed in section IV.B.3.b, DOE 
acknowledges there could be issues 
with converting entire production lines 
to manufacture heat pump water heaters 
before the compliance date of this 
standard. Given the five-year delay in 
the compliance date with the amended 
standard from the issuance from the 
final rule, and the fact that many 
manufacturers are already developing 
heat pump water heaters, DOE believes 
manufacturers may be able to convert all 
their product lines before the 
compliance date of an amended energy 
conservation standard. 
ii. Residential Oil-Fired Storage Water 
Heaters 
While amended energy conservation 
standards could impact current market 
shares in the oil-fired storage water 
heater market, it is unlikely that 
standards would result in a constrained 
market. For oil-fired storage water 
heaters, the fundamental fabrication and 
assembly equipment would not be 
expected to change significantly in 
order to comply with TSL 1 through 
TSL 6. While DOE research suggests that 
products that meet TSL 1 through TSL 
6 require relatively minor changes to the 
insulation material or thickness, the 
product conversion costs necessary at 
these TSLs could cause at least one 
manufacturer with significant market 
share to exit the residential oil-fired 
storage water heater market due to the 
low total shipment volumes. At any 
efficiency level that would likely 
require a multi-flue heat exchanger (i.e., 
TSL 7), all but one manufacturer would 
need to make a significant and costly 
redesign of existing residential oil-fired 
product lines and related manufacturing 
facilities. These substantial changes 
could cause manufacturers to exit the 
residential oil-fired storage water heater 
market. However, even TSL 7 is 
unlikely to result in a constrained 
market even if any manufacturer exited 
the oil-fired residential water heater 
market. One residential oil-fired storage 
water heater manufacturer with 
significant market share has products 
that meet the max-tech level. Due to the 
low shipment volumes of oil-fired 
storage water heaters, this manufacturer 
could meet the total industry demand 
and industry-wide capacity would not 
be impacted. 
iii. Gas-Fired Instantaneous Water 
Heaters 
There may be short-term capacity 
constraints for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters at TSL 7. DOE research 
suggests that all gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters are currently imported. If 
the amended energy conservation 
standards required more-efficient 
products than those currently offered, 
foreign manufacturers and parent 
companies would have to decide 
whether the relatively small market for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters in 
the United States could justify the 
required investments. DOE expects that 
TSL 1 through TSL 6 would be unlikely 
to disrupt supply to the United States 
because of the number of existing 
product lines that manufacturers could 
offer without substantial product 
develop would not greatly change at the 
required efficiencies. The number of 
existing product lines on the market 
drops substantially at TSL 7. There 
could be capacity constraints in 
response to amended energy 
conservation standards at TSL 7 if 
manufacturers that do not have 
compliant products chose not to 
develop them for the United States 
market due to the current size of the 
market. 
iv. Traditional Direct Heating 
Equipment 
Amended energy conservation 
standards could lead to a constrained 
traditional DHE market. DOE does not 
expect that traditional DHE 
manufacturers would need to 
substantially modify existing facilities 
in response to amended energy 
conservation standards at TSL 1 or TSL 
2. However, at TSL 3 though TSL 6, 
some manufacturers would face 
complete product redesigns for either 
gas wall fan or gas room DHE. A 
complete redesign would entail 
significant product development, 
tooling, certification, and testing costs. 
Some manufacturers indicated that low 
shipment volumes would make these 
costs unjustifiable for many product 
lines, thereby leading to the 
discontinuation of those lines. Small 
businesses with less access to capital 
would be even more likely to face this 
problem than higher-volume, more 
diversified competitors, possibly 
resulting in further industry 
consolidation. Pressure that forced 
manufacturers to consolidate or exit the 
market could also strain the remaining 
manufacturers’ capacity to increase 
production to meet industry demand. 
However at TSL 3, DOE believes that 
manufacturers have enough existing 
products in multiple product classes 
that they could selectively upgrade 
enough product lines to meet industry 
demand and remain in business. 
However, DOE believes setting an 
amended energy conservation standard 
above TSL 3 could lead to 
manufacturing capacity problems for 
certain product classes if manufacturers 
cannot make the tooling changes in time 
to meet the standard, if manufacturers 
do not have the resources to develop 
products that meet the required 
efficiencies, or if manufacturers 
discontinue product lines rather than 
invest an amount equal to the required 
conversion costs. 
v. Gas Hearth Direct Heating Equipment

not indicate that amended energy 
conservation standards would lead to a

constrained market. Rather, such 
manufacturers are concerned that more 
stringent energy conservation standards 
could exert additional pressures on 
companies to consolidate or exit the 
market. Manufacturers predict that unit 
shipments would decline increasingly 
as the amended energy conservation 
standard is set closer to max-tech (i.e., 
TSL 6). Manufacturers also indicated 
that the high capital conversion costs 
would lead all manufacturers to drop 
product lines or not convert all existing 
product lines at TSL 4 through TSL 6 
because of the smaller market for 
covered gas hearth products that is 
anticipated in the event of a more 
stringent amended energy conservation 
standard. The reduction in market 
demand and the lower number of 
product lines available would likely 
lead to an overcapacity of covered 
products within the industry, even if 
multiple lower-volume competitors exit 
the market. 
vi. Gas-Fired Pool Heaters 
Manufacturers indicated that, while 
other potentially negative impacts were 
possible at lower TSLs, industry 
capacity could be impacted at more 
stringent TSLs. At TSL 1 through TSL 
4, DOE research suggests that 
manufacturers could retool without 
causing capacity constraints in the 
market. If DOE were to set amended 
energy conservation standards at near- 
condensing or condensing level, most 
gas-fired pool heater manufacturers 
stated that short-term production 
capacity could be affected. While only 
TSL 6 requires fully-condensing 
products, manufacturers indicated that 
adoption of amended standards at TSL 
5 and above could cause them to 
manufacture only fully-condensing 
products in order to minimize longevity 
and warranty issues. Thus, TSL 5 and 
TSL 6 would require manufacturers to 
incur significant product and capital 
conversion costs. Consequently, DOE 
believes setting an amended energy 
conservation standard at or above TSL 
5 could lead to short-term capacity 
problems if manufacturers cannot make 
the necessary tooling, equipment, and 
assembly changes in time to meet the 
standard. 
f. Cumulative Regulatory Burden 
While any one regulation may not 
impose a significant burden on 
manufacturers, the combined effects of 
several impending regulations may have 
serious consequences for some 
manufacturers, groups of manufacturers, 
or an entire industry. Assessing the 
impact of a single regulation may 
overlook this cumulative regulatory 
burden. In addition to energy 
conservation standards, other 
regulations can significantly affect 
manufacturers’ financial operations. 
Multiple regulations affecting the same 
manufacturer can strain company-wide 
resources and can lead companies to 
abandon product lines or markets with 
lower expected future returns than 
competing products. For these reasons, 
DOE conducts an analysis of cumulative 
regulatory burden as part of its 
rulemakings pertaining to appliance 
efficiency. During previous stages of this 
rulemaking, DOE identified several 
requirements, in addition to amended 
energy conservation standards for the 
three types of heating products that 
manufacturers will face for products 
manufactured three years before and 
three years after the anticipated 
compliance date of the amended energy 
conservation standards. 
During interviews and in their written 
comments, manufacturers stated that the 
most significant of these additional 
regulations are regional ultra-low-NOX 
requirements and environmental and 
safety regulations. In response to the 
preliminary analysis, BWC commented 
that there is a substantial cost increase 
to comply with ultra-low-NOX 
requirements. (BWC, No. 46 at p. 1) 
Noritz also stated that ultra-low-NOX 
requirements are the most significant 
regulation that will affect the gas-fired 
instantaneous water heating industry 
(Noritz, No. 36 at p. 3). AHRI and 
Rheem stated that gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater 
manufacturers will have to comply with 
ultra-low-NOX emissions requirements 
in 2012. (AHRI, Public Meeting 
Transcript, No. 34.4 at p. 134; Rheem, 
No. 48 at p. 7) 
Low and ultra-low-NOX regulations 
for gas-fired water heaters are being 
implemented regionally by air quality 
management districts, including the 
South Coast Air Quality Management 
District (SCAQMD), the Bay Area Air 
Quality Management District 
(BAAQMD), the San Joaquin Valley 
Unified Air Pollution Control District 
(the Valley Air District), and the Texas 
Commission on Environmental Equality 
(TCEQ). The ultra-low-NOX regional 
standards currently in place only cover 
gas-fired storage water heaters, but 
manufacturers are concerned that these 
standards could eventually affect 
additional types of gas-fired equipment. 
While the SCAQMD, the BAAQMD, and 
the Valley Air District all mandate ultra- 
low-NOX requirements, the TCEQ only 
has low-NOX requirements. 
DOE accounted for the added cost for 
manufacturers of gas-fired storage water 
heaters to comply with regional ultra- 
low NOX requirements (see section 
IV.C.2). DOE agrees with Noritz, AHRI, 
and Rheem that ultra-low-NOX 
requirements may affect instantaneous 
gas water heaters beginning in 2012. 
While the SCAQMD does not 
distinguish between gas-fired storage 
and gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, the BAAQMD and the Valley 
Air District have separate ultra-low-NOX 
regulations for natural gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. Although 
the compliance dates of these 
regulations are pending, DOE is not 
aware of any ultra-low-NOX 
instantaneous gas-fired water heaters 
currently on the market. Consequently, 
DOE could not create a separate cost 
curve to account for the additional cost 
of instantaneous water heaters that will 
meet the upcoming ultra-low-NOX 
emissions requirements. 
There are also existing FVIR and low 
and ultra-low-NOX requirements for gas- 
fired storage water heaters, ignition 
source requirements, amended energy 
conservation standards for other 
products made by heating products 
manufacturers, State energy 
conservation standards for other 
products, and international energy 
conservation standards. The cumulative 
burden focuses on other product- 
specific Federal requirements with a 
compliance date three years prior to and 
three years after the anticipated 
compliance dates of the amended 
energy conservation standards of this 
rulemaking. However, DOE discusses 
these and other regulations and includes 
the full details of the cumulative 
regulatory burden in chapter 12 of the 
NOPR TSD. 
g. Impacts on Small Businesses 
As discussed in section IV.H.1.c, 
using average cost assumptions to 
develop an industry cash-flow estimate 
is not adequate for assessing differential 
impacts among manufacturer subgroups. 
Small manufacturers, niche equipment 
manufacturers, and manufacturers 
exhibiting a cost structure substantially 
different from the industry average 
could be affected disproportionately. 
DOE used the results of the industry 
characterization to group manufacturers 
exhibiting similar characteristics. 
Consequently, the only subgroup DOE 
identified was small manufacturers. 
DOE evaluated the impact of amended 
energy conservation standards on small 
manufacturers, as defined by SBA. As a 
result, DOE identified five residential 
water heater manufacturers, 12 DHE 
manufacturers, and one small gas-fired 
pool heater manufacturer that are 
classified as small businesses per the 
SBA definition. DOE describes the

differential impacts on these small 
businesses in section VI.B of today’s 
notice. For a complete discussion of the 
impacts on small businesses, see 
chapter 12 of the NOPR TSD. 
3. National Impact Analysis 
a. Significance of Energy Savings 
To estimate the energy savings 
attributable to potential standards, DOE 
compared the energy consumption of 
the heating products under the base case 
(no standards) to anticipated energy 
consumption of these products under 
each TSL. Table V.35 through Table 
V.37 present DOE’s NES estimates by 
product type and class for each TSL. 
Chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD describes 
these estimates in more detail.

b. Net Present Value of Consumer Costs 
and Benefits 
DOE estimated the cumulative NPV to 
the Nation of total heating product 
consumer costs and savings that would 
result from particular standard levels. In 
accordance with the OMB Circular A–4, 
DOE calculated the NPV using both a 
7-percent and a 3-percent real discount 
rate. The 7-percent rate is an estimate of 
the average before-tax rate of return to 
private capital in the U.S. economy, and 
reflects the returns to real estate and 
small business capital as well as 
corporate capital. DOE used this 
discount rate to approximate the 
opportunity cost of capital in the private 
sector, as OMB analysis has found the 
average rate of return to capital to be 
near this rate. In addition, DOE used the 
3-percent rate to capture the potential 
effects of amended standards on private 
consumption (e.g., through higher prices 
for products and reduced purchases of 
energy). This rate represents the rate at 
which society discounts future 
consumption flows to their present 
value. This rate can be approximated by 
the real rate of return on long-term 
government debt (i.e., yield on Treasury 
notes minus annual rate of change in the 
Consumer Price Index), which has 
averaged about 3 percent on a pre-tax 
basis for the last 30 years. 
Table V.38 through Table V.40 show 
the consumer NPV results for each 
TSL DOE considered for the three types 
of heating products, using both a 7- 
percent and a 3-percent discount rate. 
See chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD for 
more detailed NPV results.

c. Net Present Value of Benefits From 
Energy Price Impacts 
DOE estimated the cumulative NPV of 
the economy-wide savings in natural gas 
expenditures during the forecast period 
due to the projected decline in natural 
gas prices resulting from amended 
standards on water heaters. DOE 
calculated the cumulative NPV for the 
efficiency levels in each product class 
corresponding to each TSL using both a 
7-percent and a 3-percent discount rate 
(Table V.41). (The impact of amended 
standards for direct heating equipment 
and pool heaters was not estimated for 
the reasons explained in section IV.F.) 
See chapter 10 of the NOPR TSD for 
further details. As discussed in section 
IV.F.2.g, DOE was not able to estimate 
the impact of the considered TSLs on 
electricity prices.

* Impacts for units sold from 2015 to 2045. 
d. Impacts on Employment 
Employment impacts consist of direct 
and indirect impacts. Direct 
employment impacts are any changes in 
the number of employees of 
manufacturers of the appliance products 
that are the subject of this rulemaking, 
their suppliers, and related service 
firms. Indirect employment impacts are 
changes in employment in the larger 
economy that occur due to the shift in 
expenditures and capital investment 
caused by the purchase and operation of 
more-efficient appliances. The MIA 
addresses the direct employment 
impacts that concern manufacturers of 
the three heating products (see section 
V.B.2 above). 
To estimate the indirect employment 
impacts of potential amended energy 
conservation standards, DOE used an 
input/output model of the U.S. economy 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 20:45 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\11DEP2.SGM 11DEP2jle

65956 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
(see section IV.I)). The input/output 
model results suggest that amended 
standards would be likely to increase 
the net demand for labor in the 
economy slightly. Table V.42 presents 
the estimated net indirect employment 
impacts from the TSLs that DOE 
considered for water heaters. The 
estimated impacts from the potential 
amended standards for DHE and pool 
heaters would be much smaller. (Note 
that the input/output model DOE uses 
does not report the quality or wage level 
of the jobs.) See chapter 14 of the NOPR 
TSD for more detailed results.

7 ............................................................................................... ¥6.98 19.37 54.03 68.11 
While DOE’s analysis suggests that 
amended standards could increase the 
net demand for labor in the economy, 
the estimated gains would be very small 
relative to total national employment. 
Therefore, DOE has tentatively 
concluded that the considered standard 
levels would be likely to produce 
employment benefits sufficient to fully 
offset any adverse impacts on 
employment in the manufacturing 
industries related to the three types of 
heating products that are the subject of 
this rulemaking. 
4. Impact on Utility or Performance of 
Products 
As discussed in section III.D.1.d, DOE 
has tentatively concluded that none of 
the efficiency levels considered in this 
notice would reduce the utility or 
performance of the three types of 
heating products. Furthermore, 
manufacturers of these products 
currently offer heating products that 
meet or exceed the proposed standards. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(IV)) 
5. Impact of Any Lessening of 
Competition 
DOE has also considered any 
lessening of competition likely to result 
from amended standards. The Attorney 
General determines the impact, if any, 
of any lessening of competition likely to 
result from a proposed standard, and 
transmits its determination to the 
Secretary, together with an analysis of 
the nature and extent of the impact. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(V) and (ii)) 
To assist the Attorney General in 
making such a determination, DOE has 
provided DOJ with copies of this notice 
and the TSD for review. DOE will 
consider DOJ’s comments on the 
proposed rule in preparing the final 
rule, and DOE will publish and respond 
to DOJ’s comments in that document. 
6. Need of the Nation To Conserve 
Energy 
Improving the energy efficiency of 
heating products when economically 
justified would likely improve the 
security of the Nation’s energy system 
by reducing overall demand for energy. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VI)) Reduced 
electricity demand may also improve 
the reliability of the electricity system. 
Energy savings from amended 
standards for heating products could 
also produce environmental benefits in 
the form of reduced emissions of air 
pollutants and greenhouse gases 
associated with energy production and 
the use of fossil fuels at the sites where 
heating products are used. Table V.43 
and Table V.44 provide DOE’s estimate 
of cumulative CO2, NOX, and Hg 
emissions reductions that would be 
expected to result from the TSLs 
considered in this rulemaking. In the 
environmental assessment (chapter 16 
of the NOPR TSD), DOE reports the 
estimated annual change in CO2, NOX, 
and Hg emissions attributable to each 
TSL. 
For DHE, DOE estimates a very slight 
increase in Hg emissions under the 
proposed standard. The reason for this 
result is that the more-efficient products 
save natural gas, but they also use more 
electricity due to electronic ignition 
and, for some DHE TSLs, use of a fan. 
This results in higher electricity 
generation than in the reference case, 
which leads to higher emissions. 
However, because the increase in 
electricity that these more efficient 
products are projected to use is 
comparatively small when compared to 
the reduction in natural gas usage, there 
will be an overall efficiency gain from 
the proposed standard. For CO2 and 
NOX, the higher emissions from the 
power sector would also be canceled out 
by lower household emissions from gas 
combustion, resulting in a total 
emissions decrease under the 
considered TSLs. This is not the case for 
Hg because there are no household Hg 
emissions to offset. 
As discussed in section IV.K, DOE 
does not report SO2 emissions 
reductions from power plants because 
there is uncertainty about the effect of 
energy conservation standards on the 
overall level of SO2 emissions in the 
United States due to SO2 emissions 
caps. DOE also did not include NOX 
emissions reduction from power plants 
in States subject to CAIR because an 
energy conservation standard would not 
affect the overall level of NOX emissions 
in those States due to the emissions

DOE estimated the cumulative 
monetary value of the economic benefits 
associated with CO2 emissions 
reductions expected to result from 
amended standards for the three types 
of heating products. As discussed in 
section IV.K, in considering the 
potential global benefits resulting from 
reduced CO2 emissions, DOE used 
values based on a social cost of carbon 
of approximately $5, $10, $20, $34 and 
$56 per metric ton avoided in 2007 
(values expressed in 2008$). DOE also 
calculated the domestic benefits based 
on a value of approximately $1 per 
metric ton avoided in 2007. To monetize 
the CO2 emissions reductions expected 
to result from amended standards for 
heating products in 2013–2045, DOE 
escalated the above values for 2007 
using a three-percent escalation rate. For 
each of the three types of heating 
products, DOE calculated the 
cumulative monetary value for each TSL 
using both a 7-percent and 3-percent 
discount rate (see Table V.45 through 
Table V.50).

DOE also estimated a range for the 
cumulative monetary value of the 
economic benefits associated with NOX 
and Hg emissions reductions 
anticipated to result from amended 
standards for the three types of heating 
products under consideration in this 
rulemaking. Table V.51 through Table 
V.54 present the results for NOX 
emissions reductions. Table V.53 
presents the results for Hg emissions 
reductions for water heaters. The values 
for Hg emissions reductions for direct 
heating equipment and pool heater TSLs 
are negligible.

The NPV of the monetized benefits 
associated with emissions reductions 
can be viewed as a complement to the 
NPV of the consumer savings calculated 
for each TSL considered in this 
rulemaking. Table V.55 presents the 
NPV values for water heaters that would 
result if DOE were to add the low- and 
high-end estimates of the potential 
benefits resulting from reduced CO2, 
NOX and Hg emissions to the NPV of 
consumer savings calculated for each 
TSL considered in this rulemaking, at 
both a 7- and 3-percent discount rate. 
Table V.56 presents the NPV values for 
DHE that would result if DOE were to 
add the low- and high-end estimates of 
the potential global benefits resulting 
from reduced CO2 emissions to the NPV 
of consumer savings calculated for each 
TSL considered in this rulemaking, at 
both a 7- and 3-percent discount rate. 
Table V.57 presents the same NPV 
values for pool heaters. For CO2, only 
the low and high global benefit values 
are used for these tables ($5 and $56 in 
2008$). 
Although adding the value of 
consumer savings to the values of 
emission reductions provides a valuable 
perspective, please note the following: 
1) the national consumer savings are 
domestic U.S. consumer monetary 
savings found in market transactions, 
while the values of emission reductions 
are based on ranges of estimates of 
imputed marginal social costs, which, in 
the case of CO2, are meant to reflect 
global benefits; and 2) the assessments 
of consumer savings and emission- 
related benefits are performed with 
different computer models, leading to 
different time frames for the analyses. 
For water heaters, for example, the 
present value of national consumer 
savings is measured for the period 
2015–2065 (30 years from 2015 to 2045, 
plus the longest lifetime of the 
equipment shipped in the 30th year). 
However, the time frames of the benefits 
associated with the emission reductions 
differ. For example, the value of CO2 
emission reductions is meant to reflect 
the present value of all future climate- 
related impacts, even those beyond 
2065. 
DOE seeks comment on its 
presentation of NPV values and on the 
consideration of GHG emissions in 
future energy conservation standards 
rulemakings, including alternative 
methodological approaches to including 
GHG emissions in its analysis. More 
specifically, DOE seeks comment on 
both how it integrates monetized GHG 
emissions or Social Cost of Carbon 
values, as well as other monetized 
benefits or costs, into its analysis and 
models, and also on suggested 
alternatives to the current approach.

7. Other Factors 
In determining whether a standard is 
economically justified, the Secretary of 
Energy may consider any other factors 
that the Secretary deems to be relevant. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)(VII)) The 
Secretary has decided that the LCC 
impacts on identifiable groups of 
consumers, such as senior citizens and 
residents of multi-family housing who 
may be disproportionately affected by 
any national energy conservation 
standard level, is a relevant factor. The 
impacts on the identified consumer

subgroups are described in section V.B.1 
above. 
DOE also believes that uncertainties 
associated with the heat pump water 
heater market (e.g., product availability) 
are relevant to consider. These 
uncertainties are discussed in section 
V.C below. 
C. Proposed Standards 
When considering proposed 
standards, DOE recognizes that EPCA 
specifies that any new or amended 
energy conservation standard for any 
type (or class) of covered product shall 
be designed to achieve the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency that 
the Secretary determines is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A)) In determining whether a 
standard is economically justified, the 
Secretary must determine whether the 
benefits of the standard exceed its 
burdens to the greatest extent 
practicable, in light of the seven 
statutory factors discussed previously. 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) The new or 
amended standard must also ‘‘result in 
significant conservation of energy.’’ (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) 
DOE considered the impacts of 
standards at each trial standard level, 
beginning with the maximum 
technologically feasible level, to 
determine whether each level was 
economically justified. If the max-tech 
level is not justified, DOE then 
considers the next most efficient level 
and undertakes the same evaluation 
until it reached the highest level that is 
both technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and saves a 
significant amount of energy. 
To aid the reader as DOE discusses 
the benefits and/or burdens of each trial 
standard level, the tables in the 
following sections present summaries of 
the results of DOE’s quantitative 
analysis at each TSL for each of the 
three heating products based on the 
methodology discussed above. 
Additional quantitative results (e.g., the 
cumulative NPV to natural gas 
consumers of the economy-wide savings 
in natural gas expenditures during the 
forecast period due to the projected 
decline in natural gas prices resulting 
from amended standards on the three 
types of heating products) are provided 
in section V.B.3. 
In addition to the quantitative results, 
DOE also considers other burdens and 
benefits that affect economic 
justification. These include the LCC 
impacts on identifiable subgroups of 
consumers, such as seniors and 
residents of multi-family housing, who 
may be disproportionately affected by 
any national energy conservation 
standard level, and the uncertainties 
associated with the heat pump water 
heater market. 
DOE also notes that the economics 
literature provides a wide-ranging 
discussion of how consumers trade-off 
upfront costs and energy savings in the 
absence of government intervention. 
Much of this literature attempts to 
explain why consumers appear to 
undervalue energy efficiency 
improvements. This undervaluation 
suggests that regulation that promotes 
energy efficiency can produce 
significant net private gains (as well as 
producing social gains by, for example, 
reducing pollution). There is evidence 
that consumers undervalue future 
energy savings as a result of (1) A lack 
of information, (2) a lack of sufficient 
savings to warrant delaying or altering 
purchases (e.g. an inefficient ventilation 
fan in a new building or the delayed 
replacement of a water pump), (3) 
inconsistent (e.g. excessive short-term) 
weighting of future energy cost savings 
relative to available returns on other 
investments, (4) computational or other 
difficulties associated with the 
evaluation of relevant tradeoffs, and (5) 
a divergence in incentives (e.g. renter 
versus owner; builder v. purchaser). 
Other literature indicates that with less 
than perfect foresight and a high degree 
of uncertainty about the future, 
consumers may tradeoff these types of 
investments at a higher than expected 
rate between current consumption and 
uncertain future energy cost savings. 
While DOE is not prepared at present to 
provide a fuller quantifiable framework 
for this discussion, DOE seeks 
comments on how to assess these 
possibilities.

† Changes in 2044 
‡ Range of the economic value of CO2 reductions is based on estimates of the global benefit of reduced CO2 emissions. 
DOE first considered TSL 7, which 
represents the max-tech efficiency levels 
for all four product classes. TSL 7 
would save 16.85 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
7 would provide a NPV of consumer 
benefit of $2.75 billion, using a discount 
rate of 7 percent, and $48.0 billion, 
using a discount rate of 3 percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 7 are 965 Mt of CO2, 730 kt of 
NOX, and 4.43 t of Hg. The estimated 
monetary value of the cumulative CO2 
emissions reductions at TSL 7 is $2.13 
billion to $23.48 billion, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $5.13 to 
$56.45 billion, using a discount rate of 
3 percent. Total electricity generating 
capacity in 2044 is estimated to 
decrease by 5.28 gigawatts (GW) under 
TSL 7.

loss of $55 for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, a gain of $273 for electric 
storage water heaters, a gain of $655 for 
oil-fired storage water heaters, and a 
loss of $307 for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters. The median payback 
period is 14.1 years for gas-fired storage 
water heaters, 8.2 years for electric 
storage water heaters, 1.4 years for oil- 
fired storage water heaters, and 39.5 
years for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters (which is substantially longer 
than the mean lifetime of the product). 
At TSL 7, the fraction of consumers 
experiencing an LCC benefit is 36 
percent for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, 54 percent for electric storage 
water heaters, 93 percent for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and 12 percent for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters. 
The fraction of consumers experiencing 
an LCC cost is 62 percent for gas-fired 
storage water heaters, 45 percent for 
electric storage water heaters, 0 percent 
for oil-fired storage water heaters, and 
83 percent for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters. 
At TSL 7, the projected change in the 
INPV is estimated to decrease up to 
$538 million for gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters, a decrease of up 
to $3.5 million for residential oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and a decrease of 
up to $66 million for gas-fired 
instantaneous water waters, in 2008$. 
For gas and electric storage water 
heaters, the impacts are driven 
primarily by the assumptions regarding 
the ability for manufacturers to produce 
products at these efficiency levels in the 
volumes necessary to serve the entire 
market. Manufacturers would need to 
redesign almost all of their products at 
TSL 7, which would force 
manufacturers to incur significant 
product and capital conversion costs. 
Some loss in product utility may also 
occur for units that are presently 
installed in space-constrained 
applications because condensing and 
heat pump technologies would typically 
cause water heaters to have a larger 
footprint. At TSL 7, DOE recognizes the 
risk of very large negative impacts if 
manufacturers’ expectations about 
reduced profit margins are realized. In 
particular, if the high end of the range 
of impacts is reached as DOE expects, 
TSL 7 could result in a net loss of 63.8 
percent in INPV for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters, a net loss 
of 39.9 percent in INPV for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and a net loss of 
10.9 percent in INPV for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. 
At TSL 7, the average LCC savings are 
lower for all of the considered consumer 
subgroups than for the full household 
sample for electric and gas-fired storage 
water heaters. In the case of electric 
storage water heaters, the multi-family 
subgroup would experience an average 
negative LCC savings of $357 (i.e., the 
average LCC would increase), and three- 
fourths of the households would 
experience a net cost. For the other 
subgroups, the fraction of households 
that would experience a net cost is close 
to or just above 50 percent, which is 
slightly higher than for the full 
household sample. The impact on the 
multi-family subgroup is primarily due 
to the lower hot water use per family 
among these households. 
For gas-fired storage water heaters at 
TSL 7, condensing operation would be 
required. DOE has several concerns 
related to the condensing gas-fired 
storage water heater market. At the time 
of the NOPR analysis, there were no 
condensing gas-fired storage water 
heaters available to residential 
consumers in the United States. DOE is 
concerned about the ability of 
manufacturers to convert all product 
lines to manufacture condensing gas- 
fired storage water heaters in the 
volumes needed by the compliance date 
of the standard, because the 
manufacturers’ ability to afford the 
necessary conversion costs is uncertain. 
In addition, uncertainties exist about 
whether manufacturers will be able to 
train enough installers and servicers of 
condensing gas-fired water heaters to 
serve the relevant market by the 
compliance date of the standard. As 
with electric storage heat pump water 
heaters, DOE is concerned that a typical 
installer or repair person will not have 
the knowledge required to troubleshoot 
or repair condensing gas-fired storage 
water heaters since they are more 
complex than traditional gas-fired 
storage water heaters. It is unclear 
whether reliable installation and 
servicing could be achieved by the 
effective date for compliance with the 
standard. 
TSL 7 also includes an efficiency 
level for electric storage water heaters 
that will require the use of heat pump 
technology. The substantial average 
savings for customers estimated by 
DOE’s analysis for TSL 7 are primarily 
driven by the results for heat pump 
water heaters. However, DOE has 
concerns about issues with the current 
heat pump water heater market that may 
prevent heat pump technology from 
being ready for full scale 
implementation. DOE fully discusses 
these concerns and seeks comments 
from interested parties on a variety of 
issues associated with heat pump water 
heaters in its discussion of the benefits 
and burdens of TSL 6, below. 
The Secretary tentatively concludes 
that at TSL 7, the benefits of energy 
savings, positive NPV of consumer 
benefits, generating capacity reductions, 
and emission reductions would be 
outweighed by the economic burden on 
a significant fraction of consumers due 
to the large increases in first costs 
associated with electric heat pump 
water heaters and gas-fired condensing 
water heaters, the disproportionate 
impacts to consumers in multi-family 
housing, the large capital conversion 
costs that could result in a large 
reduction in INPV for the 
manufacturers, as well as the 
uncertainty associated with providing 
products at the max-tech level on a scale 
necessary to serve the entire market. 
Consequently, the Secretary has 
tentatively concluded that TSL 7 is not 
economically justified. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 6. The 
efficiency levels in TSL 6 include the 
ENERGY STAR program level for 
electric storage water heaters, which 
requires heat pump water heaters. TSL 
6 would save 10.4 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
6 would increase consumer NPV by $8.4 
billion, using a discount rate of 7 
percent, and increase the NPV by $41.5 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 6 are 346 Mt of CO2, 254 kt of 
NOX, and 2.18 t of Hg. The estimated 
monetary value of the cumulative CO2 
emissions reductions at TSL 6 is $749 
billion to $8.235 billion, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $1.824 
billion to $20.066 billion, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. Total 
generating capacity in 2044 is estimated 
to decrease by 2.59 GW under TSL 6. 
At TSL 6, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact is a gain of $68 for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, a gain of 
$224 for electric storage water heaters, 
a gain of $395 for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and no change for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. The 
median payback period is 2.7 years for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, 8.3 years 
for electric storage water heaters, 0.5 
years for oil-fired storage water heaters, 
and 23.5 years for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters (which is 
longer than the mean lifetime of the 
product). At TSL 6, the fraction of 
consumers experiencing an LCC benefit 
is 68 percent for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, 50 percent for electric storage 
water heaters, 55 percent for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and 4 percent for

electric storage water heaters, 0 percent 
for oil-fired storage water heaters, and 
11 percent for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters. 
At TSL 6, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to 
$305.8 million for gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters, a decrease of up 
to $0.4 million for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and a decrease of up to $1.8 
million for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, in 2008$. The negative impacts 
on INPV are driven largely by the 
required efficiencies for electric storage 
water heaters which effectively require 
heat pump technology. The oil-fired 
storage water heater and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater efficiencies 
do not require substantial changes to the 
existing operations for some 
manufacturers. The significant changes 
for electric storage water heaters help to 
drive the INPVs negative, especially if 
profitability is impacted after the 
compliance date of the amended energy 
conservation standard. In particular, if 
the high end of the range of impacts is 
reached as DOE expects, TSL 6 could 
result in a net loss of 36.3 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters, a net loss of 4.3 percent 
in INPV for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and a net loss of 0.3 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters. 
TSL 6 includes efficiency levels for 
electric storage water heaters that are 
currently only achievable through the 
use of advanced heat pump 
technologies. DOE’s analysis indicates 
that dramatic reductions in energy use 
and substantial economic savings are 
possible for electric water heaters with 
the use of these technologies. The 
average savings for electric water heater 
customers estimated by DOE’s analysis 
for TSL 6 are primarily driven by the 
results for heat pump water heaters. 
While DOE finds the potential energy 
savings resulting from a national heat 
pump water heater standard very 
favorable, DOE has some concerns 
regarding the manufacturability and the 
market for heat pump water heaters, 
which are further discussed below. 
Heat pump technologies are currently 
used in space heating and cooling, and 
other refrigeration-cycle products, 
indicating that this technology is a 
viable design option. The use of heat 
pump water heaters adds dramatically 
to the MSP estimates, increasing the 
MSP more than $400 over the baseline 
electric storage water heater. In part due 
to this change, the total installed cost to 
the consumer increases by an average of 
$900 for heat pump water heaters 
compared to traditional electric storage 
water heaters that use electric resistance 
heating elements. Even though there are 
potential benefits of adopting an 
amended energy conservation standard 
requiring heat pump technologies, DOE 
is concerned about the uncertainties 
currently experienced in the heat pump 
water heater market. 
Although most manufacturers are in 
the process of developing a heat pump 
water heater to offer to consumers in 
response to the ENERGY STAR program 
or have recently began to offer a heat 
pump water heater model for sale, heat 
pump water heaters were not offered for 
sale at the time DOE’s analysis was 
developed. DOE’s shipments model 
projects that by 2015 heat pump water 
heaters will achieve approximately five 
percent market share. The manufacturer 
impacts are driven primarily by the 
assumptions regarding the ability of 
manufacturers to produce heat pump 
water heaters in the full range of rated 
storage volumes in the quantities 
necessary to serve the entire market. 
Though most electric storage water 
heater manufacturers indicated that they 
are in the process of developing heat 
pump water heaters, all manufacturers 
believe that an efficiency level that 
requires heat pump water heater 
technology is not appropriate as an 
amended energy conservation standard. 
Several manufacturers expect that they 
will have to buy the heat pump modules 
from outside vendors because most 
water heater manufacturers have no 
experience manufacturing heat pumps 
and have limited space in their facilities 
to produce heat pump systems. 
Manufacturers stated that they would 
consider moving all or part of their 
existing production capacity abroad if 
the energy conservation standard is set 
at TSL 6 because many manufacturers 
expect to have to redesign their facilities 
completely to accommodate a minimum 
energy conservation standard requiring 
heat pump water heaters. DOE is 
concerned about the capability of 
manufacturers to convert all product 
lines to manufacture heat pump water 
heaters in the volumes needed by the 
compliance date of the standard, 
because producing exclusively heat 
pump water heaters will require $119 
million in conversion costs plus an 
additional $256 million in working 
capital for a $375 million cash 
requirement. In addition, water heater 
manufacturers would be dependent 
upon the ability of heat pump 
component manufacturers (e.g., 
compressor manufacturers) to ramp up 
production to support the new market 
by the compliance date of the amended 
standard. DOE invites comments on the 
viability for high-volume production of 
heat pump water heaters in the full 
range of rated storage volumes and also 
requests information or data that would 
allow an assessment of such viability to 
be conducted. (See Issue 11 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
DOE also notes that the service 
industry has very little experience with 
integrated heat pump water heater 
designs because heat pump water 
heaters have only been available in the 
U.S. market in the past for short periods 
of time, and have only recently become 
available to the U.S. market once again. 
DOE is concerned that a typical installer 
or repair person would not have the 
requisite knowledge to troubleshoot or 
repair heat pump water heaters because 
they are more complex than traditional 
electric storage water heaters. It is 
unclear whether reliable installation 
and servicing could be achieved on the 
scale needed by the compliance date of 
the amended standard. 
In addition, although DOE’s analysis 
reveals that heat pump water heaters are 
capable of being installed in all of the 
types of installations currently serviced 
by the residential electric storage water 
heating market, DOE found that in 
certain situations (especially indoor 
locations) installations could be very 
costly for consumers, requiring them to 
alter their existing space to 
accommodate a heat pump water heater. 
DOE estimates 30 to 40 percent of 
installations would require such 
building modifications. In part for this 
reason, DOE estimated that 12 percent 
of electric storage water heater 
consumers would experience an 
increase of more than $500 in their LCC 
compared to the base case. 
Another concern DOE has regarding 
heat pump water heaters is the impact 
on consumer utility in the instances 
when electric storage water heaters are 
installed in conditioned indoor spaces. 
DOE estimates that 39 percent of electric 
storage water heaters are installed in 
conditioned spaces. In these cases, the 
cold air given off by the heat pump 
module may negatively impact 
consumer comfort due to uneven 
heating and cooling. 
DOE strongly considered TSL 6 as the 
proposed standard level for residential 
water heaters. DOE is concerned, 
however, about the ability for 
manufacturers to ramp up production in 
time to meet the demand by the 
compliance date of amended standards, 
the potential large increases in total 
installed cost to certain consumers, the 
ability for the service industry to gain 
the knowledge and experience 
necessary to provide reliable service to 
consumers, the potential impacts on

multi-family households, and the 
potential impacts on the space 
conditioning of the residence. DOE 
seeks comments and data from 
interested parties that will allow DOE to 
further bring clarity to the issues 
surrounding heat pump water heaters, 
and determine how the issues discussed 
in the paragraphs above could be 
adequately addressed prior to the 
compliance date of an amended national 
energy conservation standard for water 
heaters that would effectively require 
the use of such technology. (See Issue 
16 under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) For today’s proposed rule, the 
Secretary tentatively concludes that at 
TSL 6, the benefits of energy savings, 
generating capacity reductions, and 
emission reductions would be 
outweighed by the negative economic 
impacts on those consumers that would 
have to make structural changes to 
accommodate the larger footprint of the 
heat pump water heaters, the economic 
burden on a large fraction of consumers 
due to the large increases in first costs 
associated with heat pump water 
heaters, the disproportionate impacts to 
consumers in multi-family housing and 
others with comparatively low usage 
rates, the large capital conversion costs 
that could result in a large reduction in 
INPV for the manufacturers, and the 
uncertainties associated with the heat 
pump water heater market. DOE is 
particularly concerned about product 
availability for the heat pump water 
heater market since it is unclear 
whether manufacturers would be able to 
produce equipment in the volumes 
necessary to serve the entire market. 
DOE will revisit this decision and 
strongly reconsider adoption of TSL 6 in 
the final rule in light of any comments 
and data submitted by interested 
parties. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 5, in 
which DOE paired efficiency levels that 
would effectively require different 
technologies for large-volume and 
small-volume gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters in an effort to 
promote advance technology 
penetration into the market and 
potentially save additional energy. 
Specifically, TSL 5 would effectively 
require heat pump technology for 
electric storage water heaters greater 
than 55 gallons and condensing 
technology for gas-fired storage water 
heaters greater than 55 gallons. 
TSL 5 would save 3.7 quads of energy, 
an amount DOE considers significant. 
Under TSL 5, the NPV of consumer 
benefit would be $6.64 billion, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $21.89 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 5 are 217 Mt of CO2, 165 kt of 
NOX, and 0.60 t of Hg. The estimated 
monetary value of the cumulative CO2 
emissions reductions at TSL 5 is $0.492 
to $5.409 billion, using a discount rate 
of 7 percent, and $1.162 to $12.787 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. Total generating capacity in 
2044 is estimated to decrease by 0.96 
GW under TSL 5. 
At TSL 5, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact is a gain (consumer 
cost savings) of $78 for gas-fired storage 
water heaters, a gain of $96 for electric 
storage water heaters, a gain of $395 for 
oil-fired storage water heaters, and no 
change for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters. The median payback period is 
3.0 years for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, 5.9 years for electric storage 
water heaters, 0.5 years for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and 23.5 years for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters 
(which is longer than the mean lifetime 
of the product). At TSL 5, the fraction 
of consumers experiencing an LCC 
benefit is 68 percent for gas-fired storage 
water heaters, 65 percent for electric 
storage water heaters, 55 percent for oil- 
fired storage water heaters, and 4 
percent for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters. The fraction of consumers 
experiencing an LCC cost is 16 percent 
for gas-fired storage water heaters, 25 
percent for electric storage water 
heaters, 0 percent for oil-fired storage 
water heaters, and 11 percent for gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters. 
At TSL 5, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to 
$129.9 million for gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters, a decrease of up 
to $0.4 million for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and a decrease of up to $1.8 
million for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, in 2008$. The negative impacts 
on INPV are driven largely by the 
required efficiencies for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters with rated 
storage volumes above 55 gallons. TSL 
5 would effectively require heat pump 
technology and condensing technology 
for the electric and gas-fired storage 
water heaters at these volume sizes. The 
efficiency requirements at TSL 5 for 
electric storage water heater with a rated 
volume less than 55 also result in 
negative impacts because such large 
increases in insulation also require 
manufacturers to implement changes to 
their existing equipment. The oil-fired 
storage water heater and gas-fired 
instantaneous water heater efficiencies 
at TSL 5 do not require substantial 
changes to the existing operations for 
some manufacturers. The significant 
changes gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters with rated storage 
volumes greater than 55 gallons help to 
drive the INPVs negative, especially if 
profitability is impacted after the 
compliance date of the amended energy 
conservation standard. In particular, if 
the high end of the range of impacts is 
reached as DOE expects, TSL 5 could 
result in a net loss of 15.4 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters, a net loss of 4.3 percent 
in INPV for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and a net loss of 0.3 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters. 
DOE believes TSL 5 would provide an 
effective mechanism for increasing the 
market penetration for advanced- 
technology water heaters. Given DOE’s 
concerns with TSL 6 (which includes a 
national heat pump water heater 
standard for electric storage water 
heaters across the entire range of rated 
storage volumes) as described above, 
DOE also strongly considered proposing 
TSL 5. TSL 5 results in positive NPV of 
consumer benefit for both electric and 
gas-fired storage water heaters, while 
also providing additional energy and 
carbon savings. 
Using DOE’s shipments model and 
market assessment, DOE estimated 
approximately 4 percent of gas-fired 
storage water heater shipments and 11 
percent of models would fall into the 
large-volume water heater category 
using the TSL 5 division (i.e., large 
water heaters with storage volumes 
above 55 gallons). Similarly, DOE 
estimated approximately 9 percent of 
electric storage water heater shipments 
and 27 percent of models would fall 
into the large-volume water heater 
category using the TSL 5 division. 
Compared to TSL 6, TSL 5 effectively 
requires heat pump technology for a 
relatively small fraction of the electric 
storage water heater market, reduces the 
number of installations that would 
necessitate significant building 
modifications due to the size of heat 
pump water heaters, reduces the 
number of installations that have space 
conditioning impacts from cool air 
produced by the heat pump water heater 
operation, results in higher average 
savings and lower median payback 
periods, and reduces the negative 
impacts on consumer subgroups. For 
gas-fired storage water heaters, 
compared to a national condensing 
standard level (TSL 7), TSL 5 requires 
condensing technology for a relatively 
small fraction of the gas storage water 
heater market, reduces the number of 
installations that require significant 
building modifications due to the size of 
condensing gas water heaters, and

results in higher average LCC savings 
and lower median payback period. 
Even though DOE has identified a 
number of benefits associated with TSL 
5, DOE is aware that there are multiple 
issues associated with promulgating an 
amended energy conservation standard 
that affects only a subset of the products 
on the market. Potential issues with TSL 
5 affecting both heat pump water 
heaters and condensing gas-fired water 
heaters include: (1) Consumer 
acceptance; (2) training; (3) product 
substitution; (4) engineering resource 
constraints; (5) product discontinuation; 
and (6) manufacturing issues. 
First, consumers may elect not to buy 
the larger volume water heaters for a 
number of reasons, including increased 
first cost, being unfamiliar with the 
advanced technologies being used, and 
installation size constraints. Both heat 
pump and condensing water heaters are 
significantly more expensive than 
baseline water heaters of the same 
nominal capacity and take up more 
space per nominal gallon of capacity. As 
a result, consumers may buy multiple 
water heaters that are under the capacity 
limit and use them in parallel to achieve 
the same nominal capacity, although at 
a higher standby loss. 
Furthermore, the current water heater 
service and installation infrastructure 
has little to no experience installing and 
servicing these advanced-technology 
storage water heaters, leading to 
possible reluctance of contractors to 
install these products. To minimize unit 
damage and warranty claims and to 
improve market acceptance, 
manufacturers would likely have to 
expend significant additional resources 
to hire training staff to tour the country 
and to provide technical support at 
headquarters. Additionally, field 
technicians likely would need 
additional licenses and test equipment 
to be able to service heat pump water 
heaters properly (for example, to recover 
refrigerant). These additional 
requirements would likely increase 
installation and service costs beyond 
current levels, since consumers will 
have fewer servicers/installers to choose 
from and the products have become 
more complex. 
Due to the price discrepancy between 
the cost of commercial equipment (not 
covered by the heat pump and 
condensing requirement) and residential 
products of the same capacity, the use 
of commercially-classified storage water 
heater equipment in residential 
applications would likely significantly 
expand beyond current levels under 
TSL 5. Such substitutions have health 
and safety considerations such as the 
typical lack of FVIR protection and the 
higher allowable set-point temperatures 
for commercial equipment. 
Manufacturers would likely face 
constraints regarding the abilities of 
their engineering teams to develop 
multiple water heater families, as most 
engineering departments have limited 
experience with either advanced 
technology. At a minimum, condensing 
gas-fired products would require 
manufacturers to convert existing 
commercial equipment lines to 
residential use. However, multiple 
manufacturers are expected to have to 
develop completely new platforms in 
order to remain cost-competitive. 
In light of the above, manufacturers 
could decide that the demand for 
residential heat pump and condensing 
gas water heaters would likely drop to 
a point where product conversion and 
capital costs required to modify their 
operations are not justified. As a result, 
some manufacturers would likely no 
longer manufacture residential storage 
water heaters at rated storage volumes 
above the division point (i.e., 56 gallons 
and above). Even if a manufacturer were 
to offer products, development and 
capital costs make it likely that 
consumers would have fewer product 
families to choose from than presently 
exist. Mass-manufacturing facilities 
visited by DOE were typically fine- 
tuned for units with similar assembly 
processes and cannot accommodate 
units with a wide scope of assembly 
requirements. Units that fall outside 
these standardized (high-volume) 
production settings would likely have to 
be assembled on a separate line in a new 
facility adjacent to current 
manufacturing space. The costs to 
retrofit a manufacturing plant to allow 
production of these units are high and 
the industry reaction is uncertain. DOE 
seeks comments about whether 
manufacturers would upgrade just one 
of their facilities (and produce all heat 
pump and/or condensing units there) or 
would upgrade multiple facilities to 
minimize shipping costs and 
distribution costs. Additionally, 
manufacturers could continue the trend 
to relocate to new facilities or expand 
existing facilities abroad. 
DOE strongly considered TSL 5 and 
believes it would provide additional 
energy and carbon savings, while 
mitigating some of the issues associated 
with a national heat pump water heater 
standard. However, DOE has identified 
a number of potential issues with TSL 
5 related to proposing standards that 
effectively require different technologies 
for different subsets of products. For 
today’s proposed rule, the Secretary 
tentatively concludes that at TSL 5, the 
benefits of energy savings, generating 
capacity reductions, economic savings 
for most consumers, and the emission 
reductions would be outweighed by the 
large capital conversion costs that could 
result in a large reduction in INPV for 
the manufacturers, the uncertainties 
associated with the rapid introduction 
of new product technologies, the large 
increases in first costs, especially for 
those consumers that would have to 
make structural changes, and the 
uncertainties associated with a 
promulgation of an amended energy 
conservation standards that only affects 
a subset of the market. DOE seeks 
comments and data from interested 
parties that will assist DOE in bringing 
further clarity to some of the issues 
surrounding the product division used 
in the two slope energy-efficiency 
equations, promulgation of different 
standards for a subset of products, the 
heat pump water heater market, the 
condensing water heater market, as well 
as help DOE determine how these issues 
can be adequately addressed prior to the 
compliance date of an amended energy 
conservation standard for residential 
water heaters. (See Issue 17 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.) DOE will 
revisit this decision and strongly 
consider adoption of TSL 5 in the final 
rule in light of any comments and data 
submitted by interested parties. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 4. TSL 4 
would save 2.6 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. 
Under TSL 4, the NPV of consumer 
benefit would be $4.8 billion, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $15.6 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 4 are 154 Mt of CO2, 118 kt of 
NOX, and 0.2 t of Hg. The estimated 
monetary value of the cumulative CO2 
emissions reductions at TSL 4 is $0.366 
to $4.024 billion, using a discount rate 
of 7 percent, and $0.833 to $9.166 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. Total generating capacity in 
2044 is estimated to decrease by 0.24 
GW under TSL 4. 
At TSL 4, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact is a gain of $68 for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, a gain of 
$39 for electric storage water heaters, a 
gain of $395 for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and no change for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters. The 
median payback period is 2.7 years for 
gas-fired storage water heaters, 5.8 years 
for electric storage water heaters, 0.5 
years for oil-fired storage water heaters, 
and 23.5 years for gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters (which is 
longer than the mean lifetime of the 
product). At TSL 4, the fraction of

consumers experiencing an LCC benefit 
is 68 percent for gas-fired storage water 
heaters, 65 percent for electric storage 
water heaters, 55 percent for oil-fired 
storage water heaters, and 4 percent for 
gas-fired instantaneous water heaters. 
The fraction of consumers experiencing 
an LCC cost is 15 percent for gas-fired 
storage water heaters, 25 percent for 
electric storage water heaters, 0 percent 
for oil-fired storage water heaters, and 
11 percent for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters. For gas-fired 
instantaneous water heaters, 85 percent 
of consumers would not be impacted at 
TSL 4 because DOE projects that they 
would purchase an appliance of equal 
or higher efficiency than the TSL 4 
level. 
At TSL 4, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to 
$79 million for gas-fired and electric 
storage water heaters, a decrease of up 
to $0.4 million for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and a decrease of up to $1.8 
million for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters, in 2008$. The impacts on 
manufacturers are less significant at 
TSL4 because the technology used at 
TSL 4 does not greatly differ from 
baseline models for gas-fired, electric, 
and oil-fired storage water heaters. In 
addition, most manufacturers of gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters offer 
products that meet or exceed the 
efficiencies required at TSL 4. If the 
high end of the range of impacts is 
reached as DOE expects, TSL 4 could 
result in a net loss of 9.4 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired and electric storage 
water heaters, a net loss of 4.3 percent 
in INPV for oil-fired storage water 
heaters, and a net loss of 0.3 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters. 
After considering the analysis, 
comments on the January 13, 2009, 
notice and the preliminary TSD, and the 
benefits and burdens of TSL 4, the 
Secretary tentatively concludes that this 
TSL will offer the maximum 
improvement in efficiency that is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and will result 
in significant conservation of energy. 
Further, benefits from carbon dioxide 
reductions (at a central value of $20) 
would increase NPV by between $366 
million and $4,024 million (2008$) at a 
7% discount rate and between $833 
million and $9,166 million at a 3% 
discount rate. These benefits from 
carbon dioxide emission reductions, 
when considered in conjunction with 
the consumer savings NPV and other 
factors described above support DOE’s 
tentative conclusion that trial standard 
level 4 is economically justified. 
Therefore, the Department today 
proposes to adopt TSL 4 as amended 
energy conservation standards for water 
heaters as shown in Table V.60.

DOE also calculated the annualized 
values for certain benefits and costs 
under the considered TSLs. The 
annualized values refer to consumer 
operating cost savings, consumer 
incremental product and installation 
costs, the quantity of emissions 
reductions for CO2, NOX, and Hg, and 
the monetary value of CO2 emissions 
reductions (using a value of $20/t CO2, 
which is in the middle of the values 
considered by DOE for valuing the 
potential global benefits resulting from 
reduced CO2 emissions). 
DOE used a two-step calculation 
process to convert the time-series of 
costs and benefits into annualized 
values. First, DOE calculated a present 
value for the time-series of costs and 
benefits using a discount rate of either 
three or seven percent. From the present 
value, DOE then calculated the fixed 
annual payment over the analysis time 
period (2015 to 2045 for water heaters) 
that yielded the same present value. The 
fixed annual payment is the annualized 
value. Although DOE calculated 
annualized values, this does not imply 
that the time-series of cost and benefits 
from which the annualized values were 
determined are a steady stream of 
payments. 
Table V.61 presents the annualized 
values for each TSL considered for 
water heaters. The tables also present 
the annualized net benefit that results 
from summing the two monetary 
benefits and subtracting the consumer 
incremental product and installation 
costs. Although summing the value of 
operating savings with the value of CO2 
reductions provides a valuable 
perspective, please note the following. 
The operating cost savings are domestic 
U.S. consumer monetary savings found 
in market transactions while the CO2 
value is based on an estimate of 
imputed marginal SCC, which is meant 
to reflect the global benefits of CO2 
reductions. In addition, the SCC value 
considers a longer time frame than the 
period considered for operating cost 
savings.

*** Changes in 2042. 
‡ Range of the economic value of CO2 reductions is based on estimates of the global benefit of reduced CO2 emissions. 
DOE first considered TSL 6, the max- 
tech level. TSL 6 would save 1.08 quads 
of energy, an amount DOE considers 
significant. TSL 6 would decrease 
consumer NPV by $3.54 billion, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and by $2.63 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. 
The emissions reductions at TSL 6 are 
43.0 Mt of CO2 and 39.6 kt of NOX. The 
estimated monetary value of the 
cumulative CO2 emissions reductions at 
TSL 6 is $111 to $1,216 million, using 
a discount rate of 7 percent, and $233 
to $2,564 million, using a discount rate 
of 3 percent. Total generating capacity 
in 2044 is estimated to increase slightly 
under TSL 6. 
At TSL 6, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact for consumers is a 
gain of $135 for gas wall fan DHE, $68 
for gas wall gravity DHE, $13 for gas 
floor DHE, $646 for gas room DHE and 
a loss of $253 for gas hearth DHE. The 
median payback period is 9.8 years for 
gas wall fan DHE, 13.0 years for gas wall 
gravity DHE, 14.7 years for gas floor 
DHE, 7.0 years for gas room DHE and 
37.5 for gas hearth DHE (which is 
significantly longer than the mean 
lifetime of the product). At TSL 6, the 
fraction of consumers experiencing an 
LCC benefit is 52 percent for gas wall 
fan DHE, 41 percent for gas wall gravity 
DHE, 18 percent for gas floor DHE, 49 
percent for gas room DHE and 19 
percent for gas hearth DHE. The fraction 
of consumers experiencing an LCC cost 
is 44 percent for gas wall fan DHE, 59 
percent for gas wall gravity DHE, 25 
percent for gas floor DHE, 26 percent for 
gas room DHE and 81 percent for gas 
hearth DHE. 
At TSL 6, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to 
$10.8 million for traditional DHE and a 
decrease of up to $55.1 million for gas 
hearth DHE, in 2008$. Very few 
manufacturers offer products at the 
max-tech level for both traditional and 
gas hearth DHE. At TSL 6, almost every 
manufacturer would face substantial 
product and capital conversion costs to 
completely redesign most of their 
current products and existing 
production facilities. In addition, higher 
component costs could significantly 
harm profitability. If the high end of the 
range of impacts is reached as DOE 
expects, TSL 6 could result in a net loss 
of 60.0 percent in INPV for traditional 
DHE and a net loss of 63.8 percent in 
INPV for gas hearth DHE. In addition to 
the large, negative impacts on INPV at 
TSL 6, the required capital and product 
conversion costs could cause material 
harm to a significant number of small 
businesses in both the traditional and 
gas hearth DHE market. The conversion 
costs could cause many of these small 
businesses to exit the market. 
The Secretary tentatively concludes 
that at TSL 6, the benefits of energy 
savings, generating capacity reductions, 
and emission reductions would be 
outweighed by the negative impacts on 
consumer NPV, the economic burden on 
some consumers, the large capital 
conversion costs that could result in a 
large reduction in INPV for the 
manufacturers, and the potential 
impacts on a significant number of 
small businesses. Consequently, the 
Secretary has tentatively concluded that 
TSL 6 is not economically justified. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 5. TSL 5 
would save 0.44 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
5 would decrease consumer NPV by 
$0.93 billion, using a discount rate of 7 
percent, and by $0.26 billion, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. 
The emissions reductions at TSL 5 are 
18.5 Mt of CO2 and 16.9 kt of NOX. The 
estimated monetary value of the 
cumulative CO2 emissions reductions at 
TSL 5 is $47.4 to $521 million, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $100 to 
$1,101 million, using a discount rate of 
3 percent. Total generating capacity in 
2044 is estimated to increase slightly 
under TSL 5. 
At TSL 5, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact for consumers is a 
gain of $73 for gas wall fan DHE, $68 for 
gas wall gravity DHE, $13 for gas floor 
DHE, $646 for gas room DHE and a loss 
of $70 for gas hearth DHE. The median 
payback period is 3.1 years for gas wall 
fan DHE, 13.0 years for gas wall gravity 
DHE, 14.7 years for gas floor DHE, 7.0 
years for gas room DHE, and 25.9 for gas 
hearth DHE. At TSL 5, the fraction of 
consumers experiencing an LCC benefit 
is 38 percent for gas wall fan DHE, 41 
percent for gas wall gravity DHE, 18 
percent for gas floor DHE, 49 percent for 
gas room DHE, and 17 percent for gas 
hearth DHE. The fraction of consumers 
experiencing an LCC cost is 3 percent 
for gas wall fan DHE, 59 percent for gas 
wall gravity DHE, 25 percent for gas 
floor DHE, 26 percent for gas room DHE, 
and 69 percent for gas room DHE. 
At TSL 5, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to $8 
million for traditional DHE and a 
decrease of up to $15 million for gas 
hearth DHE, in 2008$. While some 
manufacturers offer a limited number of 
products at TSL 5, most of the current 
products would have to be redesigned to 
meet the required efficiencies at TSL 5. 
In addition, higher component costs for 
both traditional and gas hearth DHE 
could significantly harm profitability. If 
the high end of the range of impacts is 
reached as DOE expects, TSL 5 could

result in a net loss of 44.8 percent in 
INPV for traditional DHE and a net loss 
of 17.1 percent in INPV for gas hearth 
DHE. In addition to the large, negative 
impacts on INPV at TSL 5, the required 
capital and product conversion costs 
could cause material harm to a 
significant number of small businesses 
in both the traditional and gas hearth 
DHE market. These manufacturers could 
be forced to discontinue many of their 
existing product lines and, possibly, exit 
the market altogether. 
The Secretary tentatively concludes 
that at trial standard level 5, the benefits 
of energy savings, generating capacity 
reductions, and emission reductions 
would be outweighed by the negative 
impacts on consumer NPV, the 
economic burden on some consumers, 
the large capital conversion costs that 
could result in a large reduction in INPV 
for the manufacturers, and the potential 
for small businesses to have to reduce 
or discontinue a significant number of 
their product lines. Consequently, the 
Secretary has tentatively concluded that 
trial standard level 5 is not 
economically justified. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 4. TSL 4 
would save 0.39 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
4 would provide a NPV of consumer 
benefit of $0.89 billion, using a discount 
rate of 7 percent, and $0.33 billion, 
using a discount rate of 3 percent. 
The emissions reductions at TSL 4 are 
16.7 Mt of CO2 and 15.2 kt of NOX. The 
estimated monetary value of the 
cumulative CO2 emissions reductions at 
TSL 4 is $42.9 to $472 million, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $90.5 to 
$996 million, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. Total generating capacity in 
2044 is estimated to increase slightly 
under TSL 4. 
At TSL 4, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact for consumers is a 
gain of $73 for gas wall fan DHE, $68 for 
gas wall gravity DHE, $13 for gas floor 
DHE, $646 for gas room DHE, and a loss 
of $70 for gas hearth DHE. The median 
payback period is 9.8 years for gas wall 
fan DHE, 8.3 years for gas wall gravity 
DHE, 14.7 years for gas floor DHE, 5.3 
years for gas room DHE and 25.9 years 
for gas hearth DHE (which is 
significantly beyond the mean lifetime 
of the equipment). At TSL 4, the fraction 
of consumers experiencing an LCC 
benefit is 52 percent for gas wall fan 
DHE, 61 percent for gas wall gravity 
DHE, 18 percent for gas floor DHE, 55 
percent for gas room DHE, and 17 
percent for gas hearth DHE. The fraction 
of consumers experiencing an LCC cost 
is 44 percent for gas wall fan DHE, 39 
percent for gas wall gravity DHE, 25 
percent for gas floor DHE, 20 percent for 
gas room DHE and 69 percent for gas 
hearth DHE. 
At TSL 4, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to $8 
million for traditional DHE and decrease 
of up to $15 million for gas hearth DHE. 
While some manufacturers offer a 
limited number of products at TSL 4, 
most of the current products would 
have to be redesigned to meet the 
required efficiencies at TSL 4. In 
addition, higher component costs for 
both traditional and gas hearth DHE 
could significantly harm profitability. If 
the high end of the range of impacts is 
reached as DOE expects, TSL 4 could 
result in a net loss of 42.1 percent in 
INPV for traditional DHE and a net loss 
of 17.1 percent in INPV for gas hearth 
DHE. In addition to the large, negative 
impacts on INPV at TSL 4, the required 
capital and product conversion costs 
could cause material harm to a 
significant number of small businesses 
in both the traditional and gas hearth 
DHE market. These manufacturers could 
be forced to reduce their product 
offerings to remain competitive. 
The Secretary tentatively concludes 
that at trial standard level 4, the benefits 
of energy savings, generating capacity 
reductions, and emission reductions 
would be outweighed by the negative 
impacts on consumer NPV, the 
economic burden on some consumers, 
the large capital conversion costs that 
could result in a large reduction in INPV 
for the manufacturers, and the potential 
for small businesses of DHE to reduce 
their product offerings. Consequently, 
the Secretary has tentatively concluded 
that trial standard level 4 is not 
economically justified. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 3. TSL 3 
would save 0.22 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
3 would provide a NPV of consumer 
benefit of $0.91 billion, using a discount 
rate of 7 percent, and $2.22 billion, 
using a discount rate of 3 percent. 
The emissions reductions at TSL 3 are 
8.5 Mt of CO2 and 7.7 kt of NOX. The 
estimated monetary value of the 
cumulative CO2 emissions reductions at 
TSL 3 is $21.8 to $240 million, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and $46.2 to 
$508 million, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. Total electric generating 
capacity in 2044 is estimated to increase 
slightly under TSL 3. 
At TSL 3, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact for consumers is a 
gain of $104 for gas wall fan DHE, $192 
for gas wall gravity DHE, $13 for gas 
floor DHE, $143 for gas room DHE, and 
$96 for gas hearth DHE. The median 
payback period is 6.0 years for gas wall 
fan DHE, 8.3 years for gas wall gravity 
DHE, 14.7 years for gas floor DHE, 5.3 
years for gas room DHE, and 0.0 years 
for gas hearth DHE. At TSL 3, the 
fraction of consumers experiencing an 
LCC benefit is 56 percent for gas wall 
fan DHE, 61 percent for gas wall gravity 
DHE, 18 percent for gas floor DHE, 55 
percent for gas room DHE, and 40 
percent for gas hearth DHE. The fraction 
of consumers experiencing an LCC cost 
is 30 percent for gas wall fan DHE, 39 
percent for gas wall gravity DHE, 25 
percent for gas floor DHE, 20 percent for 
gas room DHE, and 9 percent for gas 
hearth DHE. 
At TSL 3, the projected change in 
INPV ranges from a decrease of up to $6 
million for traditional DHE and decrease 
of up to $1 million for gas hearth DHE. 
Most traditional direct heating 
manufacturers have existing products 
that meet the efficiencies required at 
TSL 3 in three out of four product 
categories. The impacts on gas hearth 
manufacturers are less significant at TSL 
3 because manufacturers offer a wide 
range of product lines that meet the 
required efficiencies at TSL 3 and most 
products that do not meet TSL 3 could 
be upgraded with inexpensive 
purchased parts and fairly small 
conversion costs. If the high end of the 
range of impacts is reached, TSL 3 could 
result in a net loss of 33.5 percent in 
INPV for traditional DHE and a net loss 
of 1.1 percent in INPV for gas hearth 
DHE. In addition, the required capital 
and product conversion costs faced by 
small businesses decrease, mitigating 
the potential harm to a significant 
number of small businesses. 
After considering the analysis, 
comments on the January 13, 2009, 
notice and the preliminary TSD, and the 
benefits and burdens of TSL 3, the 
Secretary tentatively concludes that this 
trial standard level will offer the 
maximum improvement in efficiency 
that is technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and will result 
in significant conservation of energy. 
Further, benefits from carbon dioxide 
reductions (at a central value of $20) 
would increase NPV by between $21.8 
million and $240 million (2008$) at a 
7% discount rate and between $46.2 
million and $508 million at a 3% 
discount rate. These benefits from 
carbon dioxide emission reductions, 
when considered in conjunction with 
the consumer savings NPV and other 
factors described above support DOE’s 
tentative conclusion that trial standard 
level 3 is economically justified. 
Therefore, the Department today 
proposes to adopt the energy 
conservation standards for DHE at TSL 
3, as shown in Table V.63.

DOE also calculated the annualized 
values for certain benefits and costs 
under the considered TSLs. The 
annualized values refer to consumer 
operating cost savings, consumer 
incremental product and installation 
costs, the quantity of emissions 
reductions for CO2, NOX, and Hg, and 
the monetary value of CO2 emissions 
reductions (using a value of $20/t CO2, 
which is in the middle of the values 
considered by DOE for valuing the 
potential global benefits resulting from 
reduced CO2 emissions). 
DOE used a two-step calculation 
process to convert the time-series of 
costs and benefits into annualized 
values. First, DOE calculated a present 
value for the time-series of costs and 
benefits using a discount rate of either 
three or seven percent. From the present 
value, DOE then calculated the fixed 
annual payment over the analysis time 
period (2013 to 2043 for DHE) that 
yielded the same present value. The 
fixed annual payment is the annualized 
value. Although DOE calculated 
annualized values, this does not imply 
that the time-series of cost and benefits 
from which the annualized values were 
determined are a steady stream of 
payments. Table V.64 presents the 
annualized values for each TSL 
considered for DHE.

*** Changes in 2042. 
‡ Range of the economic value of CO2 reductions is based on estimates of the global benefit of reduced CO2 emissions. 
DOE first considered TSL 6, the max- 
tech level. TSL 6 would save 0.28 quads 
of energy, an amount DOE considers 
significant. TSL 6 would decrease 
consumer NPV by $2.9 billion, using a 
discount rate of 7 percent, and by $4.5 
billion, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. 
The emissions reductions at TSL 6 are 
12.1 Mt of CO2 and 10.8 kt of NOX. The 
estimated monetary value of the 
cumulative CO2 emissions reductions at 
TSL 6 is $33 million to $354 million, 
using a discount rate of 7 percent, and 
$66 million to $723 million, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. Total 
generating capacity in 2044 is estimated 
to increase slightly under TSL 6. 
At TSL 6, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact for consumers is a 
loss of $1,323. The median payback 
period is 28.1 years (which is 
substantially longer than the mean 
lifetime of the product). At TSL 6, the 
fraction of consumers experiencing an 
LCC benefit is 3 percent. The fraction of 
consumers experiencing an LCC cost is 
96 percent. 
At TSL 6, the projected change in 
INPV to decrease by up to $44.5 million 
for gas-fired pool heaters. Currently, gas- 
fired pool heaters that meet the 
efficiencies required by TSL 6 are 
manufactured in extremely low volumes 
by a limited number of manufacturers. 
The significant impacts on 
manufacturers arise from the large costs 
to develop or increase the production of 
fully condensing products. In addition, 
manufacturers are significantly harmed 
if profitability is negatively impacted to 
keep consumers in the market for a 
luxury item that is significantly more 
expensive than most products currently 
sold. If the high end of the range of 
impacts is reached as DOE expects, TSL 
6 could result in a net loss of 72.6 
percent in INPV for gas-fired pool 
heaters. 
The Secretary tentatively concludes 
that at TSL 6, the benefits of energy 
savings and emission reductions would 
be outweighed by the negative economic 
impacts to the Nation, the economic 
burden on some consumers (as 
indicated by the large increase in total 
installed cost), and the large capital 
conversion costs that could result in a 
large reduction in INPV for the 
manufacturers. Consequently, the 
Secretary has tentatively concluded that 
TSL 6 is not economically justified. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 5. TSL 5 
would save 0.13 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
5 would decrease consumer NPV by 
$1.3 billion, using a discount rate of 7 
percent, and by $2.0 billion, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. 
The emissions reductions at TSL 5 are 
5.7 Mt of CO2 and 5.1 kt of NOX. The 
estimated monetary value of the 
cumulative CO2 emissions reductions at 
TSL 5 is $15 million to $168 million, 
using a discount rate of 7 percent, and 
$31 million to $342 million, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. Total 
generating capacity in 2044 is estimated 
to increase slightly under TSL 5. 
At TSL 5, DOE projects that the 
average LCC impact for consumers is a 
loss of $555. The median payback 
period is 28.6 years (which is 
substantially longer than the mean 
lifetime of the product). At TSL 5, the 
fraction of consumers experiencing an 
LCC benefit is 5 percent. The fraction of 
consumers experiencing an LCC cost is 
90 percent. 
At TSL 5, the projected change in 
INPV to decrease by up to $19.5 million 
for gas-fired pool heaters. Currently, gas- 
fired pool heaters that meet the 
efficiencies required by TSL 5 are 
manufactured in extremely low volumes 
by a limited number of manufacturers, 
as with TSL 6. The significant adverse 
impacts on manufacturers arise from the 
large costs to develop or increase the 
production of products with multiple 
efficiency improvements. In addition, 
the potential for manufacturers to be 
significantly harmed increases if 
consumers purchasing decisions are 
impacted and shipments decline due to 
the large increases in first cost for a 
luxury item. If the high end of the range 
of impacts is reached as DOE expects, 
TSL 5 could result in a net loss of 31.8 
percent in INPV for gas-fired pool 
heaters. 
The Secretary tentatively concludes 
that at TSL 5, the benefits of energy 
savings and emission reductions would 
be outweighed by the negative economic 
impacts to the Nation, the economic 
burden on some consumers (as 
indicated by the large increase in total 
installed cost), and the large capital 
conversion costs that could result in a 
large reduction in INPV for the 
manufacturers. Consequently, the 
Secretary has tentatively concluded that 
TSL 5 is not economically justified. 
Next, DOE considered TSL 4. TSL 4 
would save 0.10 quads of energy, an 
amount DOE considers significant. TSL 
4 would increase consumer NPV by 
$0.03 billion, using a discount rate of 7 
percent, and by $0.25 billion, using a 
discount rate of 3 percent. 
The cumulative emissions reductions 
at TSL 4 are 4.2 Mt of CO2 and 3.7 kt 
of NOX. The estimated monetary value 
of the cumulative CO2 emissions 
reductions at TSL 4 is $11 million to 
$123 million, using a discount rate of 7 
percent, and $23 million to $251 
million, using a discount rate of 3 
percent. Total generating capacity in 
2044 is estimated to increase slightly 
under TSL 4. 
At TSL 4, the estimated increase in 
the installed cost is $335. Because this 
increase is substantially balanced by a 
decrease in operating costs, DOE 
projects that the average LCC impact for 
consumers is a loss of $13 (note that this 
quantity represents only 0.2 percent of 
the average total LCC). The median 
payback period is 13.0 years, compared 
to a typical product life of 8 years. At 
TSL 4, the fraction of consumers

experiencing an LCC benefit is 20 
percent. The fraction of consumers 
experiencing a net increase in LCC 
(mainly due to having low pool heater 
operation) is 59 percent. Of these 
consumers, the average net increase in 
LCC would be about $172, which is 
about 3 percent of the average LCC for 
these consumers. 
At TSL 4, DOE projects that INPV 
decreases by up to $7.5 million for gas- 
fired pool heaters. At TSL 4, 
manufacturers believe that profitability 
could be harmed in order to keep 
consumers in the market for a luxury 
item that is more expensive than the 
most common products currently sold. 
If the high end of the range of impacts 
is reached as DOE expects, TSL 4 could 
result in a net loss of 12.1 percent in 
INPV for gas-fired pool heaters. 
After considering the analysis, 
comments on the January 13, 2009, 
notice and the preliminary TSD, and the 
benefits and burdens of TSL 4, the 
Secretary tentatively concludes that this 
trial standard level will offer the 
maximum improvement in efficiency 
that is technologically feasible and 
economically justified, and will result 
in significant conservation of energy. 
Further, benefits from carbon dioxide 
reductions (at a central value of $20) 
would increase NPV by between $11 
million and $123 million (2008$) at a 
7% discount rate and between $23 
million and $251 million at a 3% 
discount rate. These benefits from 
carbon dioxide emission reductions, 
when considered in conjunction with 
the consumer savings NPV and other 
factors described above support DOE’s 
tentative conclusion that trial standard 
level 4 is economically justified. 
Therefore, the Department today 
proposes to adopt the energy 
conservation standards for pool heaters 
at TSL 4, which requires a thermal 
efficiency of 84 percent for gas-fired 
pool heaters as shown in Table V.66. As 
discussed above, approximately 59 
percent of consumers with pool heaters 
would experience a life cycle cost from 
the proposed standard for pool heaters, 
TSL 4. Further, DOE estimates that one- 
quarter of these consumers would 
experience LCC of less than 2%. 
Although most consumers would 
experience some savings or very small 
increases in life cycle costs, DOE is 
seeking comment regarding the 
appropriateness of proposing TSL 4 for 
pool heaters since this efficiency level 
would increase life-cycle costs for most 
consumers. DOE also seeks comment on 
its consideration of TSL 3 as an 
alternative for the final standard level 
for pool heaters. (See Issue 18 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.)

DOE also calculated the annualized 
values for certain benefits and costs 
under the considered pool heater TSLs. 
The annualized values refer to 
consumer operating cost savings, 
consumer incremental product and 
installation costs, the quantity of 
emissions reductions of CO2, NOX, and 
Hg, and the monetary value of CO2 
emissions reductions (using a value of 
$20/t CO2, which is in the middle of the 
values considered by DOE for valuing 
the potential global benefits resulting 
from reduced CO2 emissions). 
DOE used a two-step calculation 
process to convert the time-series of 
costs and benefits into annualized 
values. First, DOE calculated a present 
value for the time-series of costs and 
benefits using a discount rate of either 
three or seven percent. From the present 
value, DOE then calculated the fixed 
annual payment over the analysis time 
period (2013 to 2043 for pool heaters) 
that yielded the same present value. The 
fixed annual payment is the annualized 
value. Although DOE calculated 
annualized values, this does not imply 
that the time-series of costs and benefits 
from which the annualized values were 
determined are a steady stream of 
payments. Table V.67 presents the 
annualized values for each TSL 
considered for pool heaters.

VI. Procedural Issues and Regulatory 
Review 
A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 
Section 1(b)(1) of Executive Order 
12866, ‘‘Regulatory Planning and 
Review,’’ 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), 
requires each agency to identify in 
writing the market failure or other 
problem that it intends to address, and 
that warrants agency action (including 
where applicable, the failure of private 
markets or public institutions), as well 
as assess the significance of that 
problem, to enable assessment of 
whether any new regulation is 
warranted. The problems that today’s 
proposed standards address are as 
follows: 
(1) There is a lack of consumer 
information and/or information 
processing capability about energy 
efficiency opportunities in the home 
appliance market. 
(2) There is asymmetric information 
(one party to a transaction has more and 
better information than the other) and/ 
or high transactions costs (costs of 
gathering information and effecting 
exchanges of goods and services). 
(3) There are external benefits 
resulting from improved energy 
efficiency of heating products that are 
not captured by the users of such 
equipment. These benefits include 
externalities related to environmental 
protection and energy security that are 
not reflected in energy prices, such as 
reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. 
In addition, DOE has determined that 
today’s regulatory action is a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. 
Accordingly, section 6(a)(3) of the 
Executive Order requires that DOE 
prepare a regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA) on today’s proposed rule and that 
the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) in the OMB review this 
proposed rule. DOE presented to OIRA 
for review the draft proposed rule and 
other documents prepared for this 
rulemaking, including the RIA, and has 
included these documents in the 
rulemaking record. They are available 
for public review in the Resource Room 
of DOE’s Building Technologies 
Program, 950 L’Enfant Plaza, SW., Suite 
600, Washington, DC 20024, (202) 586– 
2945, between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., 
Monday through Friday, except Federal 
holidays. 
The RIA is contained in the TSD 
prepared for the rulemaking. The RIA 
consists of: (1) A statement of the 
problem addressed by this regulation, 
and the mandate for government action; 
(2) a description and analysis of the 
feasible policy alternatives to this 
regulation; (3) a quantitative comparison 
of the impacts of the alternatives; and 
(4) the national economic impacts of the 
proposed standards. 
The RIA calculates the effects of 
feasible policy alternatives to mandatory 
standards for heating products, and 
provides a quantitative comparison of 
the impacts of the alternatives. DOE 
evaluated each alternative in terms of its 
ability to achieve significant energy 
savings at reasonable costs, and 
compared it to the effectiveness of the 
proposed rule. DOE analyzed these 
alternatives using a series of regulatory 
scenarios for the three types of heating 
products. It modified the heating

product NIA models to allow inputs for 
these policy alternatives. Of the four 
product classes of residential water 
heaters subject to proposed standards, 
this RIA concerns only gas-fired storage 
and electric storage water heaters, 
which together represent the majority of 
shipments. Of the five product classes of 
DHE, this RIA concerns only gas wall 
fan DHE and gas hearth DHE, which 
together represent the majority of DHE 
shipments. 
DOE identified the following major 
policy alternatives for achieving 
increased energy efficiency in the three 
types of heating products: 
• No new regulatory action; 
• Consumer rebates; 
• Consumer tax credits; 
• Manufacturer tax credits; 
• Voluntary energy efficiency targets; 
• Bulk government purchases; 
• Early replacement programs; and 
• The proposed approach (energy 
conservation standards). 
DOE evaluated each alternative in 
terms of its ability to achieve significant 
energy savings at reasonable costs and 
compared it to the effectiveness of the 
proposed rule. Table VI.1 through Table 
VI.5 show the results for energy savings 
and consumer NPV.

The NPV amounts shown in Table 
VI.1 through Table VI.5 refer to the NPV 
of consumer benefits. The costs to the 
government of each policy (such as 
rebates or tax credits) are not included 
in the costs for the NPV since, on 
balance, consumers in the aggregate 
both pay for rebates and tax credits 
through taxes and receive their benefits. 
The following paragraphs discuss the 
cumulative effect of each policy 
alternative listed in Table VI.1 through 
Table VI.5. (See the regulatory impact 
analysis in the NOPR TSD for details.) 
For comparison with the results 
reported below for the non-regulatory 
policies, the combined impacts of the 
proposed standards for the considered 
products are projected as 2.75 quads of 
national energy savings and an NPV of 
$5.39 billion (at a 7-percent discount 
rate). 
No new regulatory action. The case in 
which no regulatory action is taken 
constitutes the ‘‘base case’’ (or ‘‘no 
action’’) scenario. Since this is the base 
case, energy savings and NPV are zero 
by definition. 
Rebates. If consumers were offered a 
rebate that covered a portion of the 
incremental price difference between 
products meeting baseline efficiency 
levels and those meeting the energy 
efficiency levels in the proposed 
standard, DOE estimates that the 
percentage of consumers purchasing the 
more-efficient products would increase 
by 17.5 percent to 40 percent, 
depending on the product and the 
product class. DOE assumed this policy 
would permanently transform the 
market so that the increased percentage 
of consumers purchasing more-efficient 
products seen in the first year of the 
program would be maintained 
throughout the forecast period. At the 
estimated participation rates, the rebates 
would provide 0.98 quads of national 
energy savings and an NPV of $1.83 
billion (at a 7-percent discount rate) for 
the considered products. Although DOE 
estimates that rebates would provide 
national benefits, they are expected to 
be much smaller than the benefits 
resulting from the proposed national 
standards. 
Consumer Tax Credits. If consumers 
were offered a tax credit that covered a 
portion of the incremental price 
difference between products meeting 
baseline efficiency levels and those 
meeting the energy efficiency levels in 
the proposed standards, DOE’s research 
suggests that the number of consumers 
buying a water heater, pool heater, or 
DHE that would take advantage of the 
tax credit would be approximately 60 
percent of the number that would take 
advantage of rebates. As a result of the 
tax credit, the percentage of consumers 
purchasing more-efficient products 
would increase by 10.5 percent to 24 
percent, depending on the product and 
product class. Therefore, tax credits 
would yield a fraction of the benefits of 
rebates. DOE assumed this policy would 
permanently transform the market so 
that the increased percentage of 
consumers purchasing more-efficient 
products seen in the first year of the 
program would be maintained 
throughout the forecast period. At the 
estimated participation rates, consumer 
tax credits would provide 0.59 quads of 
national energy savings and an NPV of 
$1.10 billion (at a seven-percent 
discount rate) for the considered 
products. 
Manufacturer Tax Credits. DOE 
believes even smaller benefits would

result from a manufacturer tax credit 
program that would effectively result in 
a lower price to the consumer by an 
amount that covers part of the 
incremental price difference between 
products meeting baseline efficiency 
levels and those meeting the proposed 
standards. Because these tax credits 
would go to manufacturers instead of 
consumers, DOE believes that fewer 
consumers would be aware of this 
program than a consumer tax credit 
program. DOE assumes that 50 percent 
of the consumers who would take 
advantage of consumer tax credits 
would buy more-efficient products 
offered through a manufacturer tax 
credit program. Thus, as a result of the 
manufacturer tax credit, the percentage 
of consumers purchasing the more- 
efficient products would increase by 5.2 
percent to 12 percent (i.e., 50 percent of 
the impact of consumer tax credits), 
depending on the product class. 
DOE assumed this policy would 
permanently transform the market so 
that the increased percentage of 
consumers purchasing more-efficient 
products seen in the first year of the 
program would be maintained 
throughout the forecast period. At the 
estimated participation rates, the rebates 
would provide 0.30 quads of national 
energy savings and an NPV of $0.56 
billion (at a seven-percent discount rate) 
for the considered products. Thus, DOE 
estimated that manufacturer tax credits 
would yield a fraction of the benefits 
that consumer tax credits and rebates 
would provide. 
Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targets. 
The Federal government’s ENERGY 
STAR program has voluntary energy 
efficiency targets for gas-fired and 
electric storage water heaters and gas- 
fired instantaneous water heaters. Some 
equipment purchases that result from 
the ENERGY STAR program already are 
reflected in DOE’s base-case scenario. 
DOE evaluated the potential impacts of 
increased marketing efforts by ENERGY 
STAR that would encourage the 
purchase of products meeting the 
proposed standard. DOE modeled the 
voluntary efficiency program based on 
this scenario and assumed that the 
resulting increased percentage of 
consumers purchasing more-efficient 
products would be maintained 
throughout the forecast period. DOE 
estimated that the enhanced 
effectiveness of voluntary energy 
efficiency targets would provide 0.23 
quads of national energy savings and an 
NPV of $0.55 billion (at a 7-percent 
discount rate) for the considered 
products. Although this would provide 
national benefits, they would be much 
smaller than the benefits resulting from 
the proposed national standards. 
Early Replacement Incentives. This 
policy alternative envisions a program 
to replace old, inefficient water heaters, 
DHE, and pool heaters with models 
meeting the efficiency levels in the 
proposed standards. DOE projected a 4- 
percent increase in the annual 
retirement rate of the existing stock in 
the first year of the program. It assumed 
the program would last as long as it took 
to completely replace all of the eligible 
existing stock in the year that the 
program begins (2013 or 2015). DOE 
estimated that such an early 
replacement program would provide 
negligible national energy savings and 
NPV for the considered products. The 
national energy savings benefits would 
be negligible in comparison with the 
benefits resulting from the proposed 
national standards, and the NPV would 
actually be negative. 
Bulk Government Purchases. Under 
this policy alternative, the government 
would be encouraged to purchase 
increased amounts of equipment that 
meet the efficiency levels in the 
proposed standards. Federal, State, and 
local government agencies could 
administer such a program. At the 
Federal level, this would be an 
enhancement to the existing Federal 
Energy Management Program (FEMP). 
DOE modeled this program by assuming 
an increase in installation of equipment 
meeting the efficiency levels of the 
proposed standards among those 
households for whom government 
agencies purchase or influence the 
purchase of water heaters. (Because the 
market share of DHE units in publicly- 
owned housing is minimal and the 
market share of pool heaters in publicly- 
owned housing is zero, the Department 
did not consider bulk government 
purchases for those products.) DOE 
estimated that bulk government 
purchases would provide negligible 
national energy savings (0.01 quads) and 
NPV ($0.14 billion) for the considered 
products, benefits that are much smaller 
than those estimated for the proposed 
national standards. 
Proposed Standards. DOE proposes to 
adopt the efficiency levels listed in 
section V.C. As indicated in the 
paragraphs above, none of the 
alternatives DOE examined would save 
as much energy as today’s proposed 
standards. Also, several of the 
alternatives would require new enabling 
legislation because authority to carry 
out those alternatives may not exist. 
Additional Policy Evaluation. In 
addition to the above non-regulatory 
policy alternatives, DOE evaluated the 
potential impacts of a policy that would 
allow States to require that some water 
heaters installed in new homes have an 
efficiency level higher than the Federal 
standard. At present, States are 
prohibited to require efficiency levels 
higher than the Federal standard; the 
considered policy would remove this 
prohibition in the case of residential 
water heaters. DOE notes that removing 
the prohibition would require either 
legislative authority or DOE approval, 
after a case-by-case basis consideration 
on the merits, of waivers submitted by 
States. For the present rulemaking, DOE 
evaluated the impacts that such a policy 
would have for electric storage water 
heaters. 
Specifically, DOE estimated the 
impacts for a policy case in which 
several States adopted provisions in 
their building codes that would require 
electric storage water heaters to meet 
efficiency level 6 (2.0 EF, heat pump 
with two-inch insulation). DOE 
assumed that such codes would affect 
25 percent of water heaters in all new 
homes built in the United States in 2015 
and that the percentage would increase 
linearly to 75 percent by 2045. (DOE did 
not attempt to define the specific 
geographic areas that would be 
affected.) In this policy case, all other 
water heaters (those bought for 
replacement in existing homes) would 
meet the proposed standard level of 0.95 
(efficiency level 5). DOE’s analysis 
accounts for the estimate that some new 
homes would have a water heater with 
EF greater than or equal to 2.0 (e.g., heat 
pump technology) in the absence of any 
amended standards (the base case). 
Table VI.6 shows the additional 
estimated national energy savings that 
would result from the considered 
building code policy, as well as the net 
present value of additional benefits to 
consumers (the purchasers of new 
homes that have electric water heaters 
that have an EF of at least 2.0). The table 
also shows the estimated national 
energy savings and NPV for electric 
storage water heaters under the 
proposed standards. The energy savings 
from this State building code 
requirement for new homes would be 
greater than the savings from the 
proposed standard for electric storage 
water heaters. This contrasts with the 
non-regulatory policy alternatives 
discussed above, whose savings are 
lower than those of the proposed 
standards.

B. Review Under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires preparation 
of an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis (IRFA) for any rule that by law 
must be proposed for public comment, 
unless the agency certifies that the rule, 
if promulgated, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. As 
required by Executive Order 13272, 
‘‘Proper Consideration of Small Entities 
in Agency Rulemaking’’ 67 FR 53461 
(August 16, 2002), DOE published 
procedures and policies on February 19, 
2003, to ensure that the potential 
impacts of its rules on small entities are 
properly considered during the 
rulemaking process. 68 FR 7990. DOE 
has made its procedures and policies 
available on the Office of the General 
Counsel’s Web site (http:// 
www.gc.doe.gov). 
For the manufacturers of the three 
types of heating products, the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) has set a 
size threshold, which defines those 
entities classified as ‘‘small businesses’’ 
for the purposes of the statute. DOE 
used the SBA’s small business size 
standards to determine whether any 
small entities would be subject to the 
requirements of the rule. 65 FR 30836, 
30850 (May 15, 2000), as amended at 65 
FR 53533, 53545 (September 5, 2000) 
and codified at 13 CFR part 121.The size 
standards are listed by North American 
Industry Classification System (NAICS) 
code and industry description and are 
available at http://www.sba.gov/idc/ 
groups/public/documents/ 
sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf. 
Residential water heater and pool heater 
manufacturing are classified under 
NAICS 335228, ‘‘Other Major 
Household Appliance Manufacturing’’ 
and DHE is classified under NAICS 
333414, ‘‘Heating Equipment (except 
warm air furnaces) Manufacturing.’’ The 
SBA sets a threshold of 500 employees 
or less for an entity to be considered as 
a small business for both of these 
categories as shown in Table VI.7.

DOE reviewed the potential standard 
levels considered in today’s NOPR 
under the provisions of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act and the procedures and 
policies published on February 19, 
2003. To better assess the potential 
impacts of this rulemaking on small 
entities, DOE conducted a more focused 
inquiry of the companies that could be 
small business manufacturers of 
products covered by this rulemaking. 
During its market survey, DOE used all 
available public information to identify 
potential small manufacturers. DOE’s 
research involved several industry trade 
association membership directories 
(including AHRI, HPBA, and APSP), 
product databases (e.g., AHRI, CEC, and 
ENERGY STAR databases), individual 
company Web sites, and marketing 
research tools (e.g., Dunn and Bradstreet 
reports) to create a list of every company 
that manufactures or sells water heaters, 
DHE, and gas-fired pool heaters covered 
by this rulemaking. DOE also asked 
stakeholders and industry 
representatives if they were aware of 
any other small manufacturers during 
manufacturer interviews and at previous 
DOE public meetings. DOE reviewed all 
publicly-available data and contacted 
select companies on its list, as 
necessary, to determine whether they 
met the SBA’s definition of a small 
business manufacturer of covered 
residential water heaters, DHE, and pool 
heaters. DOE screened out companies 
that did not offer products covered by 
this rulemaking, did not meet the 
definition of a ‘‘small business,’’ or are 
foreign owned and operated. Ultimately, 
DOE identified five small residential 
water heater manufacturers, 12 small 
DHE manufacturers, and one small pool 
heater manufacturer that produce 
covered products and can be considered 
small businesses. Next, DOE attempted 
to contact these potential small business 
manufacturers to request an interview 
about the possible impacts on small 
business manufacturers. The results of 
discussions with manufacturers are set 
forth below. From these discussions, 
DOE determined the expected impacts 
of the rule on affected small entities. 
DOE looked at each type of heating 
product (water heaters, pool heaters, 
and direct heating) separately for 
purposes of determining whether 
certification was appropriate or an 
initial regulatory flexibility analysis was 
needed. 
1. Water Heater Industry 
The majority of residential water 
heaters are currently manufactured in 
the United States. Three large 
manufacturers control the 
overwhelming majority of storage water 
heater sales. Many foreign-owned and 
foreign-operated manufacturers of 
instantaneous gas-fired water heaters 
offer products for sale in the United 
States and make up part of the 
remaining domestic residential water 
heater market. A very small portion of 
the remaining residential water heater 
market is supplied by a combination of 
international and domestic companies, 
all of which have less than a one-

percent total market share. Part of the 
remaining market is also supplied by 
domestic companies that focus 
primarily on commercial, niche, or 
other products, but also manufacture 
residential water heaters that are 
covered by this rulemaking. 
DOE identified five domestic small 
businesses that manufacture residential 
water heaters. Each company’s product 
offerings were examined to help 
determine the potential impact of 
amended energy conservation 
standards. 
Only one of the small businesses 
identified by DOE manufactures 
primarily products that are covered by 
this rulemaking. This company offers 
two gas-fired instantaneous water 
heaters and is also developing a heat 
pump water heater. The products 
offered by this manufacturer are 
expected to meet the ENERGY STAR 
criteria for residential water heaters and 
to achieve efficiencies higher than the 
levels being proposed in this NOPR. 
Therefore, DOE believes that none of the 
products offered by this manufacturer 
would be impacted by the proposed 
energy conservation standards for 
residential water heaters. 
Three of the small businesses 
identified by DOE manufacture covered 
oil-fired residential water heaters, but 
focus mainly on other products. One of 
these three small businesses holds a 
significant portion of the residential oil- 
fired water heater market. The products 
offered by this manufacturer exceed the 
efficiencies of the proposed standard 
levels for residential oil-fired storage 
water heaters. Therefore, DOE does not 
believe that the products offered by this 
manufacturer would be impacted by the 
proposed energy conservation standards 
for residential water heaters. The two 
other two small businesses that 
manufacture residential oil-fired storage 
water heaters both have a lower market 
share and collectively ship fewer than 
5,000 units per year. The first of these 
companies with low market share offers 
one residential oil-fired water heater 
model, but it would not need to be 
upgraded at the proposed energy 
conservation standard level. In addition, 
this manufacturer specializes in 
products outside of the scope of 
coverage for this rulemaking (e.g., 
commercial gas-fired storage water 
heaters, indirect water heaters, 
commercial electric storage water 
heaters, storage tanks, and boilers). The 
other company with low market share in 
the residential oil-fired market offers 
seven different oil-fired storage water 
heater models. However, this company 
does not certify these products on 
public databases and does not provide 
information about the input capacity or 
efficiency in its product literature, 
making it difficult to determine whether 
these are commercial or residential 
products and if they would need to be 
upgraded in response to the proposed 
energy conversation standards. 
However, from a review of the company 
Web site, DOE believes this 
manufacturer is also focused mostly on 
non-covered products. 
The final small manufacturer of 
residential water heaters has a full line 
of residential electric storage water 
heaters that would need to be upgraded 
or, possibly, discontinued in response to 
the proposed energy conservation 
standards. Depending on the importance 
of this residential line, this small 
business could exit the residential 
electric storage market rather than 
invest in the changes necessary to 
upgrade and recertify its existing 
electric storage products. However, this 
manufacturer has less than a one- 
percent market share in the residential 
storage water heater market. Product 
certification databases and the company 
Web site also indicate that this 
manufacturer focuses primarily on 
commercial water heaters and other 
non-covered products including indirect 
water heaters and boilers. Because of its 
focus on non-covered products, it is 
unlikely that this small business would 
be forced out of business in response to 
the proposed energy conservation 
standards. 
Because only one small manufacturer 
with very low market share in the 
electric storage water heater market and 
potentially one small business with very 
low market share in the residential oil- 
fired market would potentially be 
impacted by the proposed energy 
conservation standards in today’s rule, 
DOE certifies that the standards for 
water heaters set forth in the proposed 
rule, if promulgated, would not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a 
regulatory flexibility analysis for the 
water heaters portion of this 
rulemaking. DOE will transmit the 
certification and supporting statement 
of factual basis to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration for review under 5 
U.S.C. 605(b). 
DOE requests comment on the above 
analysis, as well as any information 
concerning small businesses that could 
be impacted by this rulemaking and the 
nature and extent of those potential 
impacts of the proposed energy 
conservation standards on small 
residential water heater manufacturers. 
(See Issue 19 under ‘‘Issues on Which 
DOE Seeks Comment’’ in section VII.E 
of this NOPR.) 
2. Pool Heater Industry 
The vast majority of residential pool 
heaters are currently manufactured in 
the United States. Four manufacturers 
supply over 95 percent of the market. 
Based on its market research, DOE 
identified only one small manufacturer 
of residential gas-fired pool heaters. The 
small manufacturer specializes in high- 
efficiency products that exceed the 
proposed energy conservation standard 
level, and, therefore, DOE does not 
believe the products offered by this 
manufacturer would be impacted by the 
proposed amended energy conservation 
standards for residential pool heaters. 
Additionally, this small business 
manufacturer has a very low share of the 
residential gas-fired pool heater market. 
Because only one small business 
manufacturer of residential gas-fired 
pool heaters with small market share 
exists and because this company’s 
product exceeds the proposed energy 
conservation standard levels, DOE 
certifies that the standards for pool 
heaters set forth in the proposed rule, if 
promulgated, would not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities in 
the gas-fired pool heater industry. 
Accordingly, DOE has not prepared a 
regulatory flexibility analysis for the 
pool heaters portion of this rulemaking. 
DOE will transmit this certification and 
supporting statement of factual basis to 
the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the 
Small Business Administration for 
review under 5 U.S.C 605(b). 
DOE requests comment on the above 
analysis, as well as any information 
concerning small businesses that could 
be impacted by this rulemaking and the 
nature and extent of those potential 
impacts of the proposed energy 
conservation standards on small 
residential gas-fired pool heater 
manufacturers. (See Issue 20 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
3. Direct Heating Equipment Industry 
Characteristics 
As discussed in further detail below, 
DOE determined that it cannot certify 
that the proposed energy conservation 
standard levels for DHE, if promulgated, 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. This determination results from 
the large number of small DHE 
manufacturers and the expected impact 
of the proposed standards on these 
manufacturers, as well as the likely 
greater impact of the proposed 
standards on these small businesses.

Consequently, DOE has prepared an 
IRFA for the direct heating equipment 
portion of this rulemaking, a copy of 
which DOE will transmit to the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA for 
review under 5 U.S.C 605(b). As 
presented and discussed below, the 
IFRA describes potential impacts on 
small DHE manufacturers associated 
with the required capital and product 
conversion costs at each TSL and 
discusses alternatives that could 
minimize these impacts. 
a. Description and Estimated Number of 
Small Entities Regulated 
After examining structure of the DHE 
industry, DOE determined it necessary 
to divide potential impacts on small 
DHE manufacturers into two broad 
categories: (1) Impacts on small 
manufacturers of traditional DHE (i.e., 
manufacturers of gas wall fan, gas wall 
gravity, gas floor, and gas room DHE); 
and (2) impacts on small manufacturers 
of gas hearth products. The IRFA 
presents the results for traditional DHE 
and gas hearth DHE separately to be 
consistent with the MIA results in 
section V.B.2.b, which also separate 
DHE in this manner. Traditional DHE 
and gas hearth DHE are made by 
different manufacturers (i.e., all 
manufacturers of gas hearth products do 
not manufacture traditional DHE, and 
vice versa, with one exception). 
i. Traditional Direct Heating Equipment 
Three major manufacturers control 
almost 100 percent of the traditional 
DHE market. Two of the three major 
manufacturers of traditional DHE are 
small businesses. One of the small 
businesses produces only traditional 
DHE and has products in all four 
traditional DHE product classes (i.e., gas 
wall fan, gas wall gravity, gas floor, and 
gas room DHE). The second business 
produces all five products classes of 
DHE, including gas hearth DHE. DOE 
identified a third small business with 
less than a one-percent share of the 
traditional DHE market. This company 
offers two gas wall gravity models, but 
is mainly focused on specialty hearth 
products not covered by this 
rulemaking. 
ii. Gas Hearth Direct Heating Equipment 
DOE identified 10 small 
manufacturers of gas hearth DHE. Before 
issuing this NOPR, DOE attempted to 
contact the small business 
manufacturers of gas hearth DHE. One 
of the small businesses consented to 
being interviewed during the MIA 
interviews, and DOE received feedback 
from an additional two small businesses 
through survey responses. DOE also 
obtained information about small 
business impacts while interviewing 
manufacturers that exceed the small 
business size threshold of 500 
employees in this industry. Both small 
business manufacturers and large 
manufacturers indicated that the 
number of competitors in the market has 
been declining in recent years due to 
industry consolidation and smaller 
companies exiting the market. Three 
major domestic manufacturers now 
supply a majority of the marketplace. 
None of the three major manufacturers 
is considered a small business. The 
remainder of the market is either 
imported (mostly by Canadian 
companies) or produced by one of 12 
domestic manufacturers that hold 
varying market shares. 
b. Reasons for the Proposed Rule 
Title III of EPCA sets forth a variety 
of provisions designed to improve 
energy efficiency. Part A of Title III (42 
U.S.C. 6291–6309) provides for the 
‘‘Energy Conservation Program for 
Consumer Products Other Than 
Automobiles.’’ The program covers 
consumer products and certain 
commercial equipment, including 
residential DHE, and the statute directs 
DOE to consider new and amended 
energy conservation standards for those 
products. (42 U.S.C. 6292(9)) DOE is 
proposing in today’s notice to amend 
energy conservation standards for DHE, 
as required by EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(e)(4)) 
c. Objectives of, and Legal Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule 
EPCA provides criteria for prescribing 
new or amended standards for covered 
products and equipment. (42 U.S.C 
6295(o)) As indicated above, any new or 
amended standard for the products must 
be designed to achieve the maximum 
improvement in energy efficiency that is 
technologically feasible and 
economically justified (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(A)), although EPCA 
precludes DOE from adopting any 
standard that would not result in 
significant conservation of energy. (42 
U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) Moreover, DOE 
may not prescribe a standard: (1) For 
certain products, if no test procedure 
has been established for the product; or 
(2) if DOE determines by rule that the 
standard is not technologically feasible 
or economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(3)) DOE’s current test 
procedures for water heaters, vented 
DHE, and pool heaters appear at Title 10 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 
430, subpart B, appendices E, O and P, 
respectively. EPCA also provides that, 
in deciding whether a standard is 
economically justified, DOE must, after 
receiving comments on the proposed 
standard, determine whether the 
benefits of the standard exceed its 
burdens by considering to the greatest 
extent practicable seven enumerated 
factors (described in section II.B above 
of the preamble). (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)(2)(B)(i)) 
EPCA prescribes energy conservation 
standards for direct heating products, 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(3)) and directs DOE 
to conduct two cycles of rulemakings to 
determine whether to amend these 
standards. (42 U.S.C. 6295(e)(4)) This 
rulemaking represents the first round of 
amendments to the energy conservation 
standards for DHE. 
d. Description and Estimate of 
Compliance Requirements 
i. Traditional Direct Heating Equipment 
The number of manufacturers in the 
traditional DHE market has declined 
over the past decade and leveled off 
with three major manufacturers 
remaining. While DOE explicitly 
analyzed one representative input 
capacity range for the gas wall gravity, 
gas wall fan, gas floor, and gas room 
types of DHE, manufacturers offer 
product lines that typically span 
multiple BTU ranges with many 
different features. This can result in 
many individual products, or stock 
keeping units (SKUs), offered by each 
manufacturer per product line. The 
wide range of product offering by 
manufacturers is a legacy of a higher- 
volume market that now typically 
supplies replacement units. The 
remaining manufacturers have stayed in 
business by consolidating brands and 
the legacy products of companies that 
are no longer in business to take 
increasing shares of a smaller total 
market. Because each product line is 
manufactured in low volumes, the 
discrepancy between unit shipments 
and the number of product lines 
requiring significant product and capital 
conversion costs results in negative 
impacts for all manufacturers. Many 
product development costs (e.g., testing, 
certification, and marketing) are 
somewhat fixed, making manufacturing 
scale an important consideration in 
determining whether the product 
conversion costs are economically 
justified. Similarly, even though any 
capital conversion costs can be 
capitalized over a number of years, 
these costs must be paid up front and 
have a large enough volume to justify an 
added per-unit cost. 
DOE calculated its capital and 
product conversion costs for traditional 
DHE by estimating a per-product-line

cost and assuming that every 
manufacturer would face the same per- 
product-line cost within each product 
class. DOE also assumed that any 
product line that did not meet the 
efficiency level being analyzed would 
be upgraded, thereby requiring product 
conversion and capital conversion costs. 
DOE used public data to calculate the 
number of product lines that would 
need to be upgraded at each TSL for 
each product class. To show how the 
small businesses could be differentially 
harmed, DOE compared the conversion 
costs for a typical large manufacturer 
and a typical small manufacturer within 
the industry. To calculate the 
conversion costs for a typical small 
manufacturer and a typical large 
manufacturer, DOE used publicly- 
available information to determine the 
average number of product lines that 
met each efficiency level in each 
product category for a typical small 
manufacturer and a typical large 
manufacturer of traditional DHE. For 
both small and large, DOE multiplied 
the number of product lines that fell 
below the required efficiency level by 
its estimate of the per-line capital and 
product conversion cost. Table VI.8 and 
Table VI.9 show DOE’s estimates for the 
average number of product lines at each 
TSL for a typical small manufacturer 
and a typical large manufacturer of 
traditional DHE, respectively.

Amended energy conservation 
standards have the potential to 
differentially affect the small 
businesses, because they generally lack 
the large-scale resources to alter their 
existing products and production 
facilities for those TSLs requiring major 
redesigns. While all manufacturers 
would be expected to be negatively 
impacted by amended energy 
conservation standards to varying 
degrees, the small businesses would 
face higher product conversion costs at 
lower TSLs than their large competitor. 
Both large and small manufacturers 
have several product offerings in each 
product class, sometimes at varying 
efficiency levels, but the larger 
manufacturer produces products with 
higher efficiencies in larger volumes. As 
a result, the small manufacturers would 
have to upgrade more product lines than 
the large manufacturer at lower TSLs. 
As shown in Table VI.10 and Table 
VI.11, modifying facilities and 
developing new, more-efficient products 
would cause a typical small 
manufacturer to incur higher product 
conversion costs than a typical larger 
manufacturer for TSL 1 through TSL 5.

Because the larger manufacturer offers 
more products at higher efficiencies, a 
typical small manufacturer faces 
disproportionate costs at the lower TSLs 
in absolute terms at TSL 1 through TSL 
5. However, at TSL 4 through TSL 6 a 
typical small manufacturer and a typical 
large manufacturer face similar product 
and capital conversion costs because a 
similar number of product lines fall 
below the required efficiencies. Despite 
being similar in absolute terms, at these 
TSLs the small manufacturers would be 
more likely to be disproportionately 
harmed at any TSL because they have a 
much lower volume across which to 
spread similar costs. To show how a 
smaller scale would harm a typical 
small business manufacturer, DOE used 
estimates of the market shares within 
the industry for each product class to 
estimate the typical annual revenue, 
operating profit, research and 
development expense, and capital 
expenditures for a typical large 
manufacturer and a typical small 
manufacturer using the financial 
parameters in the DHE GRIM. 
Comparing the conversion costs of a 
typical small manufacturer to a typical 
large manufacturer with operating profit 
(earnings before interest and taxation 
(EBIT)) is a rough estimate of how 
quickly the investments could be 
recouped. Table VI.12 and Table VI.13 
show these comparisons.

Table VI.12 and Table VI.13 illustrate 
that, although the investments required 
at each TSL can be considered 
substantial for all companies, the 
impacts could be greater for a typical 
small business because of much lower 
production volumes and a comparable 
number of product offerings. At higher 
TSLs, it is more likely that 
manufacturers of traditional DHE would 
reduce the number of product lines they 
offer to keep their conversion costs at 
manageable levels. At higher TSLs, 
small manufacturers would face 
increasingly difficult decisions on

whether to invest the capital required to 
be able to continue offering a full range 
of products, cut product lines, 
consolidate to maintain a large enough 
combined scale to spread the required 
conversion costs and operating 
expenses, or exit the market altogether. 
Because of the high conversion costs, 
manufacturers would likely eliminate 
their lower-volume product lines. Small 
manufacturers might only be able to 
afford to selectively upgrade their most 
popular products and be forced to 
discontinue lower-volume products 
because the product development costs 
that would be required to upgrade all of 
their existing product lines would be 
too high. 
DOE’s product line analysis reveals 
the potential for small businesses to be 
disproportionately harmed by the 
proposed standard levels and higher 
TSLs. Small traditional direct heating 
manufacturers have less access to 
capital than their larger competitor. 
Larger manufacturers profit from 
offering a variety of products and have 
the ability to fund required capital and 
product conversion costs using cash 
generated from all products. Unlike 
large manufacturers, the small 
manufacturers cannot leverage resources 
from other departments. With these 
considerations, it is more likely that the 
small businesses would have to spend 
an even greater proportion of their 
annual R&D and capital expenditures 
than shown in the industry-wide 
figures. 
In addition, small manufacturers have 
less buying power than their larger 
competitor. Traditional DHE is a low- 
volume industry, which can make it 
difficult for any manufacturer to take 
advantage of bulk purchasing power or 
economies of scale. The two small 
businesses have approximately half the 
market share of their large competitor, 
which puts them at a disadvantage 
when purchasing components and raw 
materials. In addition, the large 
manufacturer has a parent company that 
manufactures products and equipment 
other than traditional DHE. This 
manufacturer’s larger scale and 
additional manufacturing capacity 
(required for products and equipment 
other than DHE) also give the company 
more leverage with its suppliers as it 
purchases greater volumes of 
components and raw materials. During 
the manufacturer interviews, the small 
businesses commented that to comply 
with amended energy conservation 
standards, they would likely need to 
buy more purchased parts instead of 
producing most of the final product in- 
house. Because the large manufacturer 
has an advantage in purchasing power 
that would likely allow it to buy 
purchased parts at lower costs, an 
amended energy conservation standard 
that requires more purchased parts may 
differentially harm the profitability of 
the small businesses. 
Even though there is a potential for 
small businesses to be negatively 
impacted by the proposed standards, 
DOE believes that manufacturers, 
including the small businesses, would 
be able to maintain viable number of 
product offerings at TSL 3, the proposed 
standard level. A typical small business 
offers product families in three out of 
the four product types that would meet 
or exceed the proposed standard levels 
in today’s NOPR. For example, products 
are currently available on the market at 
the proposed standard level for gas wall 
gravity DHE, which comprise over 60 
percent of the traditional DHE market. 
The proposed standard levels do not 
require manufacturers, including those 
that are small, to completely redesign all 
their product lines. For those product 
lines that would need to be redesigned, 
DOE believes that small manufacturers 
would offer fewer product lines after 
amended energy conservation 
standards. However, DOE believes that 
the proposed standards would allow the 
small manufacturers to selectively 
upgrade their existing product lines and 
maintain viable production volumes 
after the compliance date of the 
amended energy conservation 
standards. DOE seeks comment on the 
potential impacts of amended standards 
on the small traditional DHE 
manufacturers. (See Issue 21 and 22 
under ‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks 
Comment’’ in section VII.E of this 
NOPR.) 
ii. Gas Hearth-Type Direct Heating 
Equipment 
While the three large manufacturers 
have a larger product offering than the 
smaller manufacturers, both small and 
large manufacturers typically offer a 
wide range of covered gas hearth DHE. 
During interviews, manufacturers 
indicated that product lines typically 
are not based on efficiency. Rather, 
product lines are groups of gas stoves, 
gas inserts, or gas fireplaces with similar 
appearances and shapes that span input 
ratings to appeal to a range of customers 
with different heating and aesthetic 
requirements. A product line is 
typically built on the same production 
platform and shares many of the same 
appearance and optional features. 
However, because products lines are 
based on appearance, features, and 
dimensions, product lines do not 
necessarily have the same efficiency 
across all input capacities. 
DOE calculated the anticipated capital 
and product development costs for gas 
hearth DHE by estimating per-line cost. 
DOE used certification databases, 
product catalogs, interviews with 
manufacturers, and sources of public 
information to estimate the number of 
product lines that meet each TSL for 
every gas hearth DHE manufacturer for 
which data was available. If a product 
line contained several products that met 
different efficiencies at different 
capacities, DOE assumed that the 
product line would be redesigned in 
response to amended energy 
conservation standards whenever the 
least-efficient product did not meet the 
required efficiency level. 
To show how small manufacturers 
would be potentially impacted 
compared to the large manufacturers, 
DOE assumed that the entire gas hearth 
DHE industry was comprised of the 12 
manufacturers identified in the market 
and technology assessment (see chapter 
3 of the TSD for more information). 
Using all available public data, DOE 
then identified the product lines and the 
efficiency levels for each product line 
made by these manufacturers. DOE used 
this information calculate the product 
line offerings of a ‘‘typical’’ large 
manufacturer and small manufacturer. 
Table VI.14 and Table VI.15 show DOE’s 
estimates for the product lines of a 
typical small and a typical large gas 
hearth manufacturer.

Table VI.14 shows that a typical small 
manufacturer currently offers nine total 
product lines: 5 at baseline efficiency 
(i.e., 64 percent AFUE), 3 at 67 percent 
AFUE, and 1 at 72 percent AFUE. Table 
VI.14 suggests that a typical small 
manufacturer would need to upgrade up 
to five product lines at TSL 1 through 
TSL 3, up to eight product lines at TSL 
4 and TSL 5, and up to nine at TSL 6. 
Table VI.15 shows that a typical large 
manufacturer currently offers 17 total 
product lines: Eight at the baseline (64 
percent AFUE), six at 67 percent AFUE, 
and three at 72 percent AFUE. Table 
VI.15 suggests that a typical large 
manufacturer would upgrade up to eight 
product lines at TSL 1 through TSL 3, 
up to 14 product lines at TSL 4 and TSL 
5, and up to 17 at TSL 6. However, DOE 
recognizes that not all manufacturers of 
gas hearth DHE currently report the 
efficiency of their products using the 
DOE test procedure, and as a result they 
may offer products at other efficiencies. 
DOE requests comment on its 
characterization of a typical large and a 
typical small gas hearth DHE 
manufacturer. (See Issue 23 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
To calculate the capital and product 
conversion costs for a typical large and 
a typical small manufacturer, DOE 
multiplied its estimate of the per- 
product-line capital and product 
conversion costs by the number of 
product lines a typical large and a 
typical small manufacturer would need 
to upgrade at each TSL. As described in 
section IV.H.2 above, DOE assumed 
manufacturers would only upgrade fifty 
percent of their existing product lines 
that did not meet the required 
efficiencies at each TSL for gas hearth 
DHE. Table VI.16 and Table VI.17 show 
DOE’s estimates for the product and 
capital conversion costs that a typical 
large manufacturer and a typical small 
manufacturer would be expected to 
incur at each TSL.

Because a typical large manufacturer 
has significantly higher market shares 
and a greater number product lines, a 
large manufacturer would have higher 
conversion costs on an absolute basis 
than a typical small manufacturer. 
However, at every TSL, a typical small 
business manufacturer could be 
disproportionately impacted. To show 
how a much smaller manufacturing 
scale could harm small business 
manufacturers as compared to large 
manufacturers, DOE used the market 
share of a typical large manufacturer 
and a typical small manufacturer to 
estimate the annual revenue, EBIT, R&D 
expense, and capital expenditures for a 
typical large and typical small 
manufacturer. DOE then compared these 
costs to the required capital and product 
conversion costs at each TSL for a 
typical large and typical small 
manufacturer. Table VI.18 through 
Table VI.19 show these comparisons.

DOE’s product line analysis illustrates 
that small businesses have the potential 
to be differentially impacted by any 
amended energy conservation standard 
because the small businesses have a 
disproportionate number of product 
lines relative to their much smaller 
scale. For TSLs 4, 5 and 6, amended 
energy conservation standards could 
force a typical small business to hire 
additional engineers, discontinue 
product lines, or selectively upgrade 
more popular products with their 
present limited engineering and product 
development resources. Because the 
annual shipments of small 
manufacturers are several times lower 
than those of major manufacturers and 
small manufacturers typically only 
manufacture gas hearth DHE, small 
companies have less buying power than 
their larger competitors. The much 
larger production volumes of large 
manufacturers give them more leverage 
to negotiate lower prices with 
component and material suppliers. 
Because these conversion costs are more 
substantial relative to the size of a 
typical small business, large 
manufacturers could take additional 
market share from small manufacturers 
at TSL 4 through TSL 6. Because TSLs 
4 and 5 require additional plant 
modifications, the added conversion 
costs make it more likely that small 
manufacturers could discontinue some 
of their least popular product lines at 
TSL 4 and TSL 5. At TSL 6, the 
substantial conversion costs could cause 
even a large manufacturer to potentially 
decide to offer fewer product lines, to 
bring down the significant product 
conversion costs. Consequently, it is 
increasingly likely that higher 
conversion costs could cause many 
small businesses to exit the market or 
become severely constrained with the 
number of product lines offered at TSLs 
4, 5, and 6. 
At TSLs 1 through 3, a typical small 
manufacturer would not face 
prohibitively large conversion costs to 
meet the amended energy conservation 
standards. At these TSLs, the amended 
energy conservation standards could be 
met with products that use electric 
ignition, which is not particularly 
capital intensive. These changes would 
also not require significant investments 
in product development costs by small 
businesses. The most substantial portion 
of the conversion costs at TSLs 1 
through 3 would be testing, recertifying, 
and remarketing all the existing product 
lines that currently meet the baseline 
efficiencies. In addition, at TSL 1 
through TSL 3, it is likely that small 
manufacturers would not discontinue a 
large number of product lines to lower 
product and capital conversion costs 
because these costs are not substantial. 
A typical small manufacturer has 
multiple product lines that meet and 
exceed the required efficiencies at TSL 
3. Also, the proposed standard levels do 
not require manufacturers to 
substantially redesign product lines that 
fall below TSL 3. 
DOE’s analysis indicates that a typical 
small manufacturer of gas hearth DHE 
already offers multiple product lines 
that meet and exceed the required 
efficiencies at TSL 3, the proposed 
energy conservation standard. In 
addition, the proposed standard levels 
do not require substantial redesign to 
existing product lines that do not meet 
the proposed TSL 3. Because most of the 
product lines that do not meet the 
proposed TSL could be upgraded with 
relatively minor changes, DOE believes 
that manufacturers, including the small 
businesses, will be able to maintain a 
viable number of product offerings at 
the proposed standard level. DOE seeks 
comment on the potential impacts on 
the small gas hearth DHE 
manufacturers. (See Issue 24 under 
‘‘Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment’’ 
in section VII.E of this NOPR.) 
e. Duplication, Overlap, and Conflict 
With Other Rules and Regulations 
DOE is not aware of any rules or 
regulations that duplicate, overlap, or 
conflict with the rule being considered 
today. 
f. Significant Alternatives to the 
Proposed Rule 
The discussion above analyzes 
impacts on small businesses that would 
result from the other TSLs DOE 
considered. Though TSLs lower than 
the proposed TSLs are expected to 
reduce the impacts on small entities, 
DOE is required by EPCA to establish 
standards that achieve the maximum

improvement in energy efficiency that 
are technically feasible and 
economically justified, and result in a 
significant conservation of energy. Thus 
DOE rejected the lower TSLs. 
In addition to the other TSLs being 
considered, the NOPR TSD includes a 
regulatory impact analysis. For DHE, 
this report discusses the following 
policy alternatives: (1) No standard, (2) 
consumer rebates, (3) consumer tax 
credits, (4) manufacturer tax credits, and 
(5) early replacement. While these 
alternatives may mitigate the economic 
impacts on small entities compared to 
the proposed standards, the energy 
savings of these regulatory alternatives 
are at least four times smaller than those 
expected from the proposed standard 
levels. Thus, DOE rejected these 
alternatives and is proposing the 
standards set forth in this rulemaking. 
DOE continues to seek input from 
businesses that would be affected by 
this rulemaking and will consider 
comments received in the development 
of any final rule. 
C. Review Under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 
This rule contains a collection-of- 
information requirement subject to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) which 
has been approved by OMB under 
control number 1910–1400. Public 
reporting burden for compliance 
reporting for energy and water 
conservation standards is estimated to 
average 30 hours per response, 
including the time for reviewing 
instructions, searching existing data 
sources, gathering and maintaining the 
data needed, and completing and 
reviewing the collection of information. 
Send comments regarding this burden 
estimate, or any other aspect of this data 
collection, including suggestions for 
reducing the burden, to DOE (see 
ADDRESSES) and by e-mail to 
Christine_J._Kymn@omb.eop.gov. 
Notwithstanding any other provision 
of the law, no person is required to 
respond to, nor shall any person be 
subject to a penalty for failure to comply 
with, a collection of information subject 
to the requirements of the PRA, unless 
that collection of information displays a 
currently valid OMB Control Number. 
D. Review Under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
DOE has prepared a draft 
environmental assessment (EA) of the 
impacts of the proposed rule, pursuant 
to the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the 
regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 
1500–1508), and DOE’s regulations for 
compliance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act (10 CFR part 
1021). This assessment includes an 
examination of the potential effects of 
emission reductions likely to result from 
the rule in the context of global climate 
change, as well as other types of 
environmental impacts. The draft EA 
has been incorporated into the TSD. 
Before issuing a final rule for the three 
type of heating products, DOE will 
consider public comments and, as 
appropriate, determine whether to issue 
a finding of no significant impact 
(FONSI) as part of a final EA or to 
prepare an environmental impact 
statement (EIS) for this rulemaking. 
E. Review Under Executive Order 13132 
Executive Order 13132, ‘‘Federalism,’’ 
64 FR 43255 (August 4, 1999) imposes 
certain requirements on agencies 
formulating and implementing policies 
or regulations that preempt State law or 
that have Federalism implications. The 
Executive Order requires agencies to 
examine the constitutional and statutory 
authority supporting any action that 
would limit the policymaking discretion 
of the States and to carefully assess the 
necessity for such actions. The 
Executive Order also requires agencies 
to have an accountable process to 
ensure meaningful and timely input by 
State and local officials in the 
development of regulatory policies that 
have Federalism implications. On 
March 14, 2000, DOE published a 
statement of policy describing the 
intergovernmental consultation process 
it will follow in the development of 
such regulations. 65 FR 13735. DOE has 
examined today’s proposed rule and has 
determined that it would not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. EPCA governs and 
prescribes Federal preemption of State 
regulations as to energy conservation for 
the products that are the subject of 
today’s proposed rule. States can 
petition DOE for exemption from such 
preemption to the extent, and based on 
criteria, set forth in EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 
6297(d)) No further action is required by 
Executive Order 13132. 
F. Review Under Executive Order 12988 
With respect to the review of existing 
regulations and the promulgation of 
new regulations, section 3(a) of 
Executive Order 12988, ‘‘Civil Justice 
Reform’’ (61 FR 4729 (Feb. 7, 1996)) 
imposes on Executive agencies the 
general duty to adhere to the following 
requirements: (1) Eliminate drafting 
errors and ambiguity; (2) write 
regulations to minimize litigation; and 
(3) provide a clear legal standard for 
affected conduct rather than a general 
standard and promote simplification 
and burden reduction. Section 3(b) of 
Executive Order 12988 specifically 
requires that Executive agencies make 
every reasonable effort to ensure that the 
regulation: (1) Clearly specifies the 
preemptive effect, if any; (2) clearly 
specifies any effect on existing Federal 
law or regulation; (3) provides a clear 
legal standard for affected conduct 
while promoting simplification and 
burden reduction; (4) specifies the 
retroactive effect, if any; (5) adequately 
defines key terms; and (6) addresses 
other important issues affecting clarity 
and general draftsmanship under any 
guidelines issued by the Attorney 
General. Section 3(c) of Executive Order 
12988 requires Executive agencies to 
review regulations in light of applicable 
standards in section 3(a) and section 
3(b) to determine whether they are met 
or it is unreasonable to meet one or 
more of them. DOE has completed the 
required review and determined that, to 
the extent permitted by law, this 
proposed rule meets the relevant 
standards of Executive Order 12988. 
G. Review Under the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4) 
(UMRA) requires each Federal agency to 
assess the effects of Federal regulatory 
actions on State, local, and Tribal 
governments and the private sector. For 
a proposed regulatory action likely to 
result in a rule that may cause the 
expenditure by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector of $100 million or more 
in any one year (adjusted annually for 
inflation), section 202 of UMRA requires 
a Federal agency to publish a written 
statement that estimates the resulting 
costs, benefits, and other effects of the 
rule on the national economy. (2 U.S.C. 
1532(a),(b)) The UMRA also requires a 
Federal agency to develop an effective 
process to permit timely input by 
elected officers of State, local, and 
Tribal governments on a proposed 
‘‘significant intergovernmental 
mandate,’’ and requires an agency plan 
for giving notice and opportunity for 
timely input to potentially affected 
small governments before establishing 
any requirements that might 
significantly or uniquely affect small 
governments. On March 18, 1997, DOE 
published a statement of policy on its 
process for intergovernmental 
consultation under UMRA (62 FR 
12820) (also available at http:// 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 20:45 Dec 10, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00142 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\11DEP2.SGM 11DEP2jle

65993 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 237 / Friday, December 11, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
www.gc.doe.gov). Although today’s 
proposed rule does not contain a 
Federal intergovernmental mandate, it 
may impose expenditures of $100 
million or more on the private sector. 
Today’s proposed rule would likely 
result in a final rule that could impose 
expenditures of $100 million or more 
between 2013 and 2045 in the 
residential sector. Therefore, DOE must 
publish a written statement assessing 
the costs, benefits, and other effects of 
the rule on the national economy. 
Section 205 of UMRA also requires DOE 
to identify and consider a reasonable 
number of regulatory alternatives before 
promulgating a rule for which UMRA 
requires such a written statement. DOE 
must select from those alternatives the 
most cost-effective and least 
burdensome alternative that achieves 
the objectives of the rule, unless DOE 
publishes an explanation for doing 
otherwise or the selection of such an 
alternative is inconsistent with law. 
As required by EPCA (42 U.S.C. 
6295(o)), today’s proposed energy 
conservation standards for the three 
types of heating products would achieve 
the maximum improvement in energy 
efficiency that DOE has determined to 
be both technologically feasible and 
economically justified. DOE may not 
select a regulatory alternative that does 
not meet this statutory standard. A full 
discussion of the alternatives 
considered by DOE is presented in the 
‘‘Regulatory Impact Analysis’’ section of 
the TSD for this proposed rule. Also, 
section 202(c) of UMRA authorizes an 
agency to prepare the written statement 
required by UMRA in conjunction with 
or as part of any other statement or 
analysis that accompanies the proposed 
rule. (2 U.S.C. 1532(c)) The TSD, 
preamble, and regulatory impact 
analysis for today’s proposed rule 
contain a full discussion of the rule’s 
costs, benefits, and other effects on the 
national economy, and, therefore satisfy 
UMRA’s written statement requirement. 
H. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 
Section 654 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105–277) requires 
Federal agencies to issue a Family 
Policymaking Assessment for any rule 
that may affect family well-being. This 
rule would not have any impact on the 
autonomy or integrity of the family as 
an institution. Accordingly, DOE has 
concluded that it is not necessary to 
prepare a Family Policymaking 
Assessment. 
I. Review Under Executive Order 12630 
DOE has determined under Executive 
Order 12630, ‘‘Governmental Actions 
and Interference with Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights,’’ 53 FR 8859 
(March 18, 1988), that this regulation 
would not result in any takings that 
might require compensation under the 
Fifth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution. 
J. Review Under the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 
Section 515 of the Treasury and 
General Government Appropriations 
Act, 2001 (44 U.S.C. 3516 note) provides 
for agencies to review most 
disseminations of information to the 
public under guidelines established by 
each agency pursuant to general 
guidelines issued by OMB. OMB’s 
guidelines were published at 67 FR 
8452 (Feb. 22, 2002), and DOE’s 
guidelines were published at 67 FR 
62446 (Oct. 7, 2002). DOE has reviewed 
today’s notice under the OMB and DOE 
guidelines and has concluded that it is 
consistent with applicable policies in 
those guidelines. 
K. Review Under Executive Order 13211 
Executive Order 13211, ‘‘Actions 
Concerning Regulations That 
Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use,’’ 66 FR 28355 (May 
22, 2001), requires Federal agencies to 
prepare and submit to OIRA at OMB, a 
Statement of Energy Effects for any 
proposed significant energy action. A 
‘‘significant energy action’’ is defined as 
any action by an agency that 
promulgates or is expected to lead to 
promulgation of a final rule, and that: 
(1) Is a significant regulatory action 
under Executive Order 12866, or any 
successor order; and (2) is likely to have 
a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy; or 
(3) is designated by the Administrator of 
OIRA as a significant energy action. For 
any proposed significant energy action, 
the agency must give a detailed 
statement of any adverse effects on 
energy supply, distribution, or use 
should the proposal be implemented, 
and of reasonable alternatives to the 
action and their expected benefits on 
energy supply, distribution, and use. 
DOE has tentatively concluded that 
today’s regulatory action, which sets 
forth energy conservation standards for 
three types of heating products, is not a 
‘‘significant energy action’’ because the 
proposed standards are not likely to 
have a significant adverse effect on the 
supply, distribution, or use of energy, 
nor has it been designated as such by 
the Administrator at OIRA. Therefore, 
DOE has not prepared a Statement of 
Energy Effects on the proposed rule. 
L. Review Under the Information 
Quality Bulletin for Peer Review 
On December 16, 2004, OMB, in 
consultation with the Office of Science 
and Technology (OSTP), issued its 
‘‘Final Information Quality Bulletin for 
Peer Review’’ (the Bulletin). 70 FR 2664 
(Jan. 14, 2005). The Bulletin establishes 
that certain scientific information shall 
be peer reviewed by qualified specialists 
before it is disseminated by the Federal 
government, including influential 
scientific information related to agency 
regulatory actions. The purpose of the 
Bulletin is to enhance the quality and 
credibility of the government’s scientific 
information. Under the Bulletin, the 
energy conservation standards 
rulemaking analyses are ‘‘influential 
scientific information,’’ which the 
Bulletin defines as ‘‘scientific 
information the agency reasonably can 
determine will have, or does have, a 
clear and substantial impact on 
important public policies or private 
sector decisions.’’ 70 FR 2664, 2667 
(Jan. 14, 2005). 
In response to OMB’s Bulletin, DOE 
conducted formal in-progress peer 
reviews of the energy conservation 
standards development process and 
analyses, and has prepared a Peer 
Review Report on the energy 
conservation standards rulemaking 
analyses. Generation of this report 
involved a rigorous, formal, and 
documented evaluation using objective 
criteria and qualified and independent 
reviewers to make a judgment as to the 
technical/scientific/business merit, the 
actual or anticipated results, and the 
productivity and management 
effectiveness of programs and/or 
projects. The ‘‘Energy Conservation 
Standards Rulemaking Peer Review 
Report’’ dated February 2007 has been 
disseminated and is available at the 
following Web site: http://

DOE requests persons scheduled to 
make an oral presentation to submit an 
advance copy of their statements at least 
one week before the public meeting. At 
its discretion, DOE may permit any 
person who cannot supply an advance 
copy of their statement to participate, if 
that person has made advance 
alternative arrangements with the 
Building Technologies Program. The 
request to give an oral presentation 
should ask for such alternative 
arrangements. 
C. Conduct of Public Meeting 
DOE will designate a DOE official to 
preside at the public meeting and may 
also use a professional facilitator to aid 
discussion. The meeting will not be a 
judicial or evidentiary-type public 
hearing, but DOE will conduct it in 
accordance with section 336 of EPCA. 
(42 U.S.C. 6306) A court reporter will be 
present to record the proceedings and to 
prepare a transcript. DOE reserves the 
right to schedule the order of 
presentations and to establish the 
procedures governing the conduct of the 
public meeting. After the public 
meeting, interested parties may submit 
further comments on the proceedings as 
well as on any aspect of the rulemaking 
until the end of the comment period. 
The public meeting will be conducted 
in an informal, conference style. DOE 
will present summaries of comments 
received before the public meeting, 
allow time for presentations by 
participants, and encourage all 
interested parties to share their views on 
issues affecting this rulemaking. Each 
participant will be allowed to make a 
prepared general statement (within time 
limits determined by DOE), before the 
discussion of specific topics. DOE will 
permit other participants to comment 
briefly on any general statements. 
At the end of all prepared statements 
on a topic, DOE will permit participants 
to clarify their statements briefly and 
comment on statements made by others. 
Participants should be prepared to 
answer questions from DOE and from 
other participants concerning these 
issues. DOE representatives may also 
ask questions of participants concerning 
other matters relevant to this 
rulemaking. The official conducting the 
public meeting will accept additional 
comments or questions from those 
attending, as time permits. The 
presiding official will announce any 
further procedural rules or modification 
of the above procedures that may be 
needed for the proper conduct of the 
public meeting. 
DOE will make the entire record of 
this proposed rulemaking, including the 
transcript from the public meeting, 
available for inspection at the U.S. 
Department of Energy, Resource Room 
of the Building Technologies Program, 
950 L’Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, 
DC 20024, (202) 586–2945, between 9 
a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through 
Friday, except Federal holidays. 
D. Submission of Comments 
DOE will accept comments, data, and 
other information on the proposed rule 
before or after the public meeting, but 
no later than the date provided at the 
beginning of this NOPR. Comments, 
data, and other information submitted to 
DOE’s e-mail address for this 
rulemaking should be provided in 
WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, PDF, or 
text (ASCII) file format. Interested 
parties should avoid the use of special 
characters or any form of encryption 
and, wherever possible, comments 
should carry the electronic signature of 
the author. Comments, data, and 
information submitted to DOE via mail 
or hand delivery/courier should include 
one signed original paper copy. No 
telefacsimiles (faxes) will be accepted. 
According to 10 CFR 1004.11, any 
person submitting information that he 
or she believes to be confidential and 
exempt by law from public disclosure 
should submit two copies: one copy of 
the document including all the 
information believed to be confidential, 
and one copy of the document with the 
information believed to be confidential 
deleted. DOE will make its own 
determination about the confidential 
status of the information and treat it 
according to its determination. 
Factors of interest to DOE when 
evaluating requests to treat submitted 
information as confidential include: (1) 
A description of the items; (2) whether 
and why such items are customarily 
treated as confidential within the 
industry; (3) whether the information is 
generally known by or available from 
other sources; (4) whether the 
information has previously been made 
available to others without obligation 
concerning its confidentiality; (5) an 
explanation of the competitive injury to 
the submitting person which would 
result from public disclosure; (6) when 
such information might lose its 
confidential character due to the 
passage of time; and (7) why disclosure 
of the information would be contrary to 
the public interest. 
E. Issues on Which DOE Seeks Comment 
DOE is particularly interested in 
receiving comments and views of 
interested parties concerning the 
following issues: 
1. The max-tech efficiency levels 
identified for the analyses, including 
whether the efficiency levels identified 
by DOE can be achieved using the 
technologies screened-in during the 
screening analysis (see section IV.B), 
and whether higher efficiencies are 
achievable using technologies that were 
screened-in during the screening 
analysis. 
2. The potential burdens to 
manufacturers of hearth-type DHE as a 
result of the testing, certification, 
reporting, and enforcement provisions. 
3. EPCA’s efficiency descriptor 
requirements in any potential test 
procedure revisions for electric pool 
heaters. 
4. DOE’s proposed definition for 
vented hearth heaters. 
5. DOE’s product classes for water 
heaters. In particular, DOE is seeking 
comment about the need for a separate 
product class for low-boy water heaters. 
6. DOE’s approach for analyzing ultra- 
low NOX gas-fired storage water heaters 
and the need for a separate product 
class. 
7. DOE’s approach to developing the 
energy efficiency equations, the 
appropriate slope of energy efficiency 
equations at each efficiency level 
analyzed, and the appropriate storage 
volumes for changing the slope of the 
line. DOE is also interested in any 
alternatives to the energy efficiency 
equations that DOE should consider for 
the final rule. 
8. The need for a separate product 
class for heat pump water heaters. 
Specifically, DOE is interested in 
receiving comments on whether a heat 
pump water heater can be used as a 
direct replacement for an electric 
resistance water heater, and the types 
and frequency of instances a heat pump 
water heater cannot be used as a direct

replacement for an electric resistance 
water heater. 
9. DOE’s proposed product classes for 
the four existing types of DHE. 
10. DOE’s proposed product class 
divisions for gas hearth DHE. 
11. The manufacturability of heat 
pump water heaters and the capability 
of manufacturers to ramp up production 
of heat pump water heaters. 
Specifically, DOE is seeking comment 
on how long it would take and the 
magnitude of the costs for 
manufacturers to convert all product 
lines to heat pump water heaters if it 
were required by an amended energy 
conservation standard. In addition, DOE 
is seeking comment about the length of 
time required to retrain installers and 
servicers of water heaters for the 
installation and servicing of heat pump 
water heaters. 
12. DOE’s estimated manufacturer 
production costs for storage water 
heaters at storage volumes outside of the 
representative volume. 
13. DOE’s analysis of installation 
costs for water heaters. DOE is 
particularly interested in comments on 
its analysis of installation costs for heat 
pump water heaters. 
14. DOE’s analysis of repair and 
maintenance costs for heat pump water 
heaters. 
15. DOE’s approach for analyzing fuel 
switching that may result from the 
proposed standards on water heaters 
and the other heating products. In 
particular, DOE requests comments on 
its general approach, which does not 
involve price elasticities; its analysis of 
switching to gas-fired storage water 
heaters in the case of a standard that 
effectively requires an electric heat 
pump water heater; its conclusion that 
the proposed standards would not 
induce switching from a gas storage 
water heater to an electric storage water 
heater; and its conclusion that the 
proposed standards would not induce 
switching for gas-fired instantaneous 
water heaters, DHE, and pool heaters. 
16. DOE’s consideration of TSL 6 in 
the final rule for residential water 
heaters and the associated issues DOE 
has identified surrounding heat pump 
water heaters. 
17. DOE’s consideration of TSL 5 in 
the final rule for residential water 
heaters and the associated issues DOE 
has identified surrounding standards 
that effectively require different 
technologies for different subsets of 
products. 
18. The appropriateness of TSL 4 for 
residential pool heaters in light of the 
negative life cycle costs for a majority of 
consumers. In addition, DOE’s 
consideration of other TSLs, including 
TSL 3, as an alternative for the final 
standard level. 
19. The impacts of the proposed 
amended energy conservation standards 
on small manufacturers of residential 
water heaters. 
20. The impacts of the proposed 
amended energy conservation standards 
on small manufacturers of gas-fired 
residential pool heaters. 
21. The impacts of the proposed 
amended energy conservation standards 
on small manufacturers of traditional 
DHE. DOE is interested in specific 
information regarding the potential for 
small manufacturers of traditional DHE 
to discontinue particular product lines 
as a result of the proposed standard, as 
well as the potential economic effect 
discontinuing those particular product 
lines would have on small 
manufacturers of traditional DHE. 
22. Alternatives to the proposed 
amended energy conservation standards 
for traditional DHE. Specifically, DOE is 
interested in information regarding 
alternatives that could provide 
significant cost-savings for small 
manufacturers while meeting DOE’s 
energy conservation goals. 
23. DOE’s characterization of typical 
small and large gas hearth DHE 
manufacturers. 
24. The impacts of the proposed 
amended energy conservation standards 
on small manufacturers of gas hearth 
DHE. 
VIII. Approval of the Office of the 
Secretary 
The Secretary of Energy has approved 
publication of today’s proposed rule.
