Medicare Program; Prospective 
Payment System and Consolidated 
Billing for Skilled Nursing Facilities for 
FY 2009 
AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: This proposed rule would 
update the payment rates used under 
the prospective payment system (PPS) 
for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), for 
fiscal year (FY) 2009. In addition, it 
would recalibrate the case-mix indexes 
so that they more accurately reflect 
parity in expenditures related to the 
implementation of case-mix refinements 
in January 2006. It also discusses our 
ongoing analysis of nursing home staff 
time measurement data collected in the 
Staff Time and Resource Intensity 
Verification (STRIVE) project. Finally, 
the proposed rule would make technical 
corrections in the regulations text with 
respect to Medicare bad debt payments 
to SNFs and the reference to the 
definition of urban and rural as applied 
to SNFs.

I. Background 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘BACKGROUND’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
Annual updates to the prospective 
payment system (PPS) rates for skilled 
nursing facilities (SNFs) are required by 
section 1888(e) of the Social Security 
Act (the Act), as added by section 4432 
of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 
(BBA), and amended by the Medicare, 
Medicaid, and State Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (SCHIP) Balanced 
Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA), 
the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP 
Benefits Improvement and Protection 
Act of 2000 (BIPA), and the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Our 
most recent annual update occurred in 
a final rule (72 FR 43412, August 3, 
2007) that set forth updates to the SNF 
PPS payment rates for fiscal year (FY) 
2008. We subsequently published two 
correction notices (72 FR 55085, 
September 28, 2007, and 72 FR 67652, 
November 30, 2007) with respect to 
those payment rate updates. 
A. Current System for Payment of 
Skilled Nursing Facility Services Under 
Part A of the Medicare Program 
Section 4432 of the BBA amended 
section 1888 of the Act to provide for 
the implementation of a per diem PPS 
for SNFs, covering all costs (routine, 
ancillary, and capital-related) of covered 
SNF services furnished to beneficiaries 
under Part A of the Medicare program, 
effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after July 1, 1998. In 
this proposed rule, we propose to 
update the per diem payment rates for 
SNFs for FY 2009. Major elements of the 
SNF PPS include: 
• Rates. As discussed in section I.F.1. 
of this proposed rule, we established per 
diem Federal rates for urban and rural 
areas using allowable costs from FY 
1995 cost reports. These rates also 
included an estimate of the cost of 
services that, before July 1, 1998, had 
been paid under Part B but were 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in a 
SNF during a Part A covered stay. We 
adjust the rates annually using a SNF 
market basket index, and we adjust 
them by the hospital inpatient wage 
index to account for geographic 
variation in wages. We also apply a 
case-mix adjustment to account for the 
relative resource utilization of different 
patient types. This adjustment utilizes a 
refined, 53-group version of the 
Resource Utilization Groups, version III 
(RUG–III) case-mix classification 
system, based on information obtained 
from the required resident assessments 
using the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0. 
Additionally, as noted in the August 4, 
2005 final rule (70 FR 45028), the 
payment rates at various times have also 
reflected specific legislative provisions, 
including section 101 of the BBRA, 
sections 311, 312, and 314 of the BIPA, 
and section 511 of the MMA. 
• Transition. Under sections 
1888(e)(1)(A) and (e)(11) of the Act, the 
SNF PPS included an initial, three- 
phase transition that blended a facility- 
specific rate (reflecting the individual 
facility’s historical cost experience) with 
the Federal case-mix adjusted rate. The 
transition extended through the 
facility’s first three cost reporting 
periods under the PPS, up to and 
including the one that began in FY 
2001. Thus, the SNF PPS is no longer 
operating under the transition, as all 
facilities have been paid at the full 
Federal rate effective with cost reporting 
periods beginning in FY 2002. As we 
now base payments entirely on the 
adjusted Federal per diem rates, we no 
longer include adjustment factors 
related to facility-specific rates for the 
coming FY. 
• Coverage. The establishment of the 
SNF PPS did not change Medicare’s 
fundamental requirements for SNF 
coverage. However, because the RUG–III 
classification is based, in part, on the 
beneficiary’s need for skilled nursing

care and therapy, we have attempted, 
where possible, to coordinate claims 
review procedures with the output of 
beneficiary assessment and RUG–III 
classifying activities. This approach 
includes an administrative presumption 
that utilizes a beneficiary’s initial 
classification in one of the upper 35 
RUGs of the refined 53-group system to 
assist in making certain SNF level of 
care determinations, as discussed in 
greater detail in section II.E. of this 
proposed rule. 
• Consolidated Billing. The SNF PPS 
includes a consolidated billing 
provision that requires a SNF to submit 
consolidated Medicare bills to its fiscal 
intermediary or Medicare 
Administrative Contractor for almost all 
of the services that its residents receive 
during the course of a covered Part A 
stay. In addition, this provision places 
with the SNF the Medicare billing 
responsibility for physical, 
occupational, and speech-language 
therapy that the resident receives during 
a noncovered stay. The statute excludes 
a small list of services from the 
consolidated billing provision 
(primarily those of physicians and 
certain other types of practitioners), 
which remain separately billable under 
Part B when furnished to a SNF’s Part 
A resident. A more detailed discussion 
of this provision appears in section IV. 
of this proposed rule. 
• Application of the SNF PPS to SNF 
services furnished by swing-bed 
hospitals. Section 1883 of the Act 
permits certain small, rural hospitals to 
enter into a Medicare swing-bed 
agreement, under which the hospital 
can use its beds to provide either acute 
or SNF care, as needed. For critical 
access hospitals (CAHs), Part A pays on 
a reasonable cost basis for SNF services 
furnished under a swing-bed agreement. 
However, in accordance with section 
1888(e)(7) of the Act, these services 
furnished by non-CAH rural hospitals 
are paid under the SNF PPS, effective 
with cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after July 1, 2002. A more detailed 
discussion of this provision appears in 
section V. of this proposed rule. 
B. Requirements of the Balanced Budget 
Act of 1997 (BBA) for Updating the 
Prospective Payment System for Skilled 
Nursing Facilities 
Section 1888(e)(4)(H) of the Act 
requires that we publish annually in the 
Federal Register: 
1. The unadjusted Federal per diem 
rates to be applied to days of covered 
SNF services furnished during the FY. 
2. The case-mix classification system 
to be applied with respect to these 
services during the FY. 
3. The factors to be applied in making 
the area wage adjustment with respect 
to these services. 
In the July 30, 1999 final rule (64 FR 
41670), we indicated that we would 
announce any changes to the guidelines 
for Medicare level of care 
determinations related to modifications 
in the RUG–III classification structure 
(see section II.E. of this proposed rule 
for a discussion of the relationship 
between the case-mix classification 
system and SNF level of care 
determinations). 
Along with other revisions proposed 
later in this preamble, this proposed 
rule provides the annual updates to the 
Federal rates as mandated by the Act. 
C. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP 
Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 
1999 (BBRA) 
There were several provisions in the 
BBRA that resulted in adjustments to 
the SNF PPS. We described these 
provisions in detail in the final rule that 
we published in the Federal Register on 
July 31, 2000 (65 FR 46770). In 
particular, section 101(a) of the BBRA 
provided for a temporary 20 percent 
increase in the per diem adjusted 
payment rates for 15 specified RUG–III 
groups. In accordance with section 
101(c)(2) of the BBRA, this temporary 
payment adjustment expired on January 
1, 2006, upon the implementation of 
case-mix refinements (see section I.F.1. 
of this proposed rule). We included 
further information on BBRA provisions 
that affected the SNF PPS in Program 
Memorandums A–99–53 and A–99–61 
(December 1999). 
Also, section 103 of the BBRA 
designated certain additional services 
for exclusion from the consolidated 
billing requirement, as discussed in 
section IV. of this proposed rule. 
Further, for swing-bed hospitals with 
more than 49 (but less than 100) beds, 
section 408 of the BBRA provided for 
the repeal of certain statutory 
restrictions on length of stay and 
aggregate payment for patient days, 
effective with the end of the SNF PPS 
transition period described in section 
1888(e)(2)(E) of the Act. In the July 31, 
2001 final rule (66 FR 39562), we made 
conforming changes to the regulations at 
§ 413.114(d), effective for services 
furnished in cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after July 1, 2002, to 
reflect section 408 of the BBRA. 
D. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP 
Benefits Improvement and Protection 
Act of 2000 (BIPA) 
The BIPA also included several 
provisions that resulted in adjustments 
to the SNF PPS. We described these 
provisions in detail in the final rule that 
we published in the Federal Register on 
July 31, 2001 (66 FR 39562). In 
particular: 
• Section 203 of the BIPA exempted 
CAH swing-beds from the SNF PPS. We 
included further information on this 
provision in Program Memorandum A– 
01–09 (Change Request #1509), issued 
January 16, 2001, which is available 
online at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
transmittals/downloads/a0109.pdf. 
• Section 311 of the BIPA revised the 
statutory update formula for the SNF 
market basket, and also directed us to 
conduct a study of alternative case-mix 
classification systems for the SNF PPS. 
In 2006, we submitted a report to the 
Congress on this study, which is 
available online at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/SNFPPS/Downloads/ 
RC__2006_PC__PPSSNF.pdf. 
• Section 312 of the BIPA provided 
for a temporary increase of 16.66 
percent in the nursing component of the 
case-mix adjusted Federal rate for 
services furnished on or after April 1, 
2001, and before October 1, 2002. The 
add-on is no longer in effect. This 
section also directed the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct 
an audit of SNF nursing staff ratios and 
submit a report to the Congress on 
whether the temporary increase in the 
nursing component should be 
continued. The report (GAO–03–176), 
which GAO issued in November 2002, 
is available online at http:// 
www.gao.gov/new.items/d03176.pdf. 
• Section 313 of the BIPA repealed 
the consolidated billing requirement for 
services (other than physical, 
occupational, and speech-language 
therapy) furnished to SNF residents 
during noncovered stays, effective 
January 1, 2001. (A more detailed 
discussion of this provision appears in 
section IV. of this proposed rule.) 
• Section 314 of the BIPA corrected 
an anomaly involving three of the RUGs 
that the BBRA had designated to receive 
the temporary payment adjustment 
discussed above in section I.C. of this 
proposed rule. (As noted previously, in 
accordance with section 101(c)(2) of the 
BBRA, this temporary payment 
adjustment expired upon the 
implementation of case-mix refinements 
on January 1, 2006.) 
• Section 315 of the BIPA authorized 
us to establish a geographic 
reclassification procedure that is 
specific to SNFs, but only after 
collecting the data necessary to establish 
a SNF wage index that is based on wage 
data from nursing homes. To date, this 
has proven to be infeasible due to the 
volatility of existing SNF wage data and 
the significant amount of resources that

25921 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
would be required to improve the 
quality of that data. 
We included further information on 
several of the BIPA provisions in 
Program Memorandum A–01–08 
(Change Request #1510), issued January 
16, 2001, which is available online at 
www.cms.hhs.gov/transmittals/ 
downloads/a0108.pdf. 
E. The Medicare Prescription Drug, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 
2003 (MMA) 
The MMA included a provision that 
results in a further adjustment to the 
SNF PPS. Specifically, section 511 of 
the MMA amended section 1888(e)(12) 
of the Act, to provide for a temporary 
increase of 128 percent in the PPS per 
diem payment for any SNF resident 
with Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS), effective with 
services furnished on or after October 1, 
2004. This special AIDS add-on was to 
remain in effect until ‘‘* * * such date 
as the Secretary certifies that there is an 
appropriate adjustment in the case mix. 
* * *’’ The AIDS add-on is also 
discussed in Program Transmittal #160 
(Change Request #3291), issued on April 
30, 2004, which is available online at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/transmittals/ 
downloads/r160cp.pdf. As discussed in 
the SNF PPS final rule for FY 2006 (70 
FR 45028, August 4, 2005), we did not 
address the certification of the AIDS 
add-on with the implementation of the 
case-mix refinements, thus allowing the 
temporary add-on payment created by 
section 511 of the MMA to continue in 
effect. 
For the limited number of SNF 
residents that qualify for the AIDS add- 
on, implementation of this provision 
results in a significant increase in 
payment. For example, using FY 2006 
data, we identified less than 2,700 SNF 
residents with a diagnosis code of 042 
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
Infection). For FY 2009, an urban 
facility with a resident with AIDS in 
RUG group ‘‘SSA’’ would have a case- 
mix adjusted payment of almost $246.55 
(see Table 4) before the application of 
the MMA adjustment. After an increase 
of 128 percent, this urban facility would 
receive a case-mix adjusted payment of 
approximately $562.13. 
In addition, section 410 of the MMA 
contained a provision that excluded 
from consolidated billing certain 
practitioner and other services 
furnished to SNF residents by rural 
health clinics (RHCs) and Federally 
Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). 
(Further information on this provision 
appears in section IV. of this proposed 
rule.) 
F. Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective 
Payment—General Overview 
We implemented the Medicare SNF 
PPS effective with cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 
1998. This PPS pays SNFs through 
prospective, case-mix adjusted per diem 
payment rates applicable to all covered 
SNF services. These payment rates 
cover all costs of furnishing covered 
skilled nursing services (routine, 
ancillary, and capital-related costs) 
other than costs associated with 
approved educational activities. 
Covered SNF services include post- 
hospital services for which benefits are 
provided under Part A and all items and 
services that, before July 1, 1998 had 
been paid under Part B (other than 
physician and certain other services 
specifically excluded under the BBA) 
but furnished to Medicare beneficiaries 
in a SNF during a covered Part A stay. 
A comprehensive discussion of these 
provisions appears in the May 12, 1998 
interim final rule (63 FR 26252). 
1. Payment Provisions—Federal Rate 
The PPS uses per diem Federal 
payment rates based on mean SNF costs 
in a base year updated for inflation to 
the first effective period of the PPS. We 
developed the Federal payment rates 
using allowable costs from hospital- 
based and freestanding SNF cost reports 
for reporting periods beginning in FY 
1995. The data used in developing the 
Federal rates also incorporated an 
estimate of the amounts that would be 
payable under Part B for covered SNF 
services furnished to individuals during 
the course of a covered Part A stay in 
a SNF. 
In developing the rates for the initial 
period, we updated costs to the first 
effective year of the PPS (the 15-month 
period beginning July 1, 1998) using a 
SNF market basket index, and then 
standardized for the costs of facility 
differences in case-mix and for 
geographic variations in wages. In 
compiling the database used to compute 
the Federal payment rates, we excluded 
those providers that received new 
provider exemptions from the routine 
cost limits, as well as costs related to 
payments for exceptions to the routine 
cost limits. Using the formula that the 
BBA prescribed, we set the Federal rates 
at a level equal to the weighted mean of 
freestanding costs plus 50 percent of the 
difference between the freestanding 
mean and weighted mean of all SNF 
costs (hospital-based and freestanding) 
combined. We computed and applied 
separately the payment rates for 
facilities located in urban and rural 
areas. In addition, we adjusted the 
portion of the Federal rate attributable 
to wage-related costs by a wage index. 
The Federal rate also incorporates 
adjustments to account for facility case- 
mix, using a classification system that 
accounts for the relative resource 
utilization of different patient types. 
The RUG–III classification system uses 
beneficiary assessment data from the 
Minimum Data Set (MDS) completed by 
SNFs to assign beneficiaries to one of 53 
RUG–III groups. The original RUG–III 
case-mix classification system included 
44 groups. However, under refinements 
that became effective on January 1, 
2006, we added nine new groups— 
comprising a new Rehabilitation plus 
Extensive Services category—at the top 
of the RUG hierarchy. The May 12, 1998 
interim final rule (63 FR 26252) 
included a detailed description of the 
original 44-group RUG–III case-mix 
classification system. A comprehensive 
description of the refined 53-group 
RUG–III case-mix classification system 
(RUG–53) appeared in the proposed and 
final rules for FY 2006 (70 FR 29070, 
May 19, 2005, and 70 FR 45026, August 
4, 2005). 
Further, in accordance with section 
1888(e)(4)(E)(ii)(IV) of the Act, the 
Federal rates in this proposed rule 
reflect an update to the rates that we 
published in the August 3, 2007 final 
rule for FY 2008 (72 FR 43412) and the 
associated correction notices (on 
September 28, 2007, 72 FR 55085, and 
November 30, 2007, 72 FR 67652), equal 
to the full change in the SNF market 
basket index. A more detailed 
discussion of the SNF market basket 
index and related issues appears in 
sections I.F.2. and III. of this proposed 
rule. 
2. Rate Updates Using the Skilled 
Nursing Facility Market Basket Index 
Section 1888(e)(5) of the Act requires 
us to establish a SNF market basket 
index that reflects changes over time in 
the prices of an appropriate mix of 
goods and services included in covered 
SNF services. We use the SNF market 
basket index to update the Federal rates 
on an annual basis. In the August 3, 
2007, FY 2008 SNF PPS final rule (72 
FR 43425 through 43430), we revised 
and rebased the market basket, which 
included updating the base year from 
FY 1997 to FY 2004. The proposed FY 
2009 market basket increase is 3.1 
percent. 
In addition, as explained in the 
August 4, 2003, final rule for FY 2004 
(66 FR 46058) and in section III.B. of 
this proposed rule, the annual update of 
the payment rates includes, as 
appropriate, an adjustment to account 
for market basket forecast error. As 
described in the final rule for FY 2008,

the threshold percentage that serves to 
trigger an adjustment to account for 
market basket forecast error is 0.5 
percentage point effective for FY 2008 
and subsequent years. This adjustment 
takes into account the forecast error 
from the most recently available FY for 
which there is final data, and applies 
whenever the difference between the 
forecasted and actual change in the 
market basket exceeds a 0.5 percentage 
point threshold. For FY 2007 (the most 
recently available FY for which there is 
final data), the estimated increase in the 
market basket index was 3.1 percentage 
points, while the actual increase was 3.1 
percentage points, resulting in no 
difference. Accordingly, as the 
difference between the estimated and 
actual amount of change does not 
exceed the 0.5 percentage point 
threshold, the payment rates for FY 
2009 do not include a forecast error 
adjustment. Table 1 below shows the 
forecasted and actual market basket 
amounts for FY 2007.

II. Annual Update of Payment Rates 
Under the Prospective Payment System 
for Skilled Nursing Facilities 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Annual Update’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
A. Federal Prospective Payment System 
This proposed rule sets forth a 
schedule of Federal prospective 
payment rates applicable to Medicare 
Part A SNF services beginning October 
1, 2008. The schedule incorporates per 
diem Federal rates that provide Part A 
payment for all costs of services 
furnished to a beneficiary in a SNF 
during a Medicare-covered stay. 
1. Costs and Services Covered by the 
Federal Rates 
In accordance with section 
1888(e)(2)(B) of the Act, the Federal 
rates apply to all costs (routine, 
ancillary, and capital-related) of covered 
SNF services other than costs associated 
with approved educational activities as 
defined in § 413.85. Under section 
1888(e)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, covered SNF 
services include post-hospital SNF 
services for which benefits are provided 
under Part A (the hospital insurance 
program), as well as all items and 
services (other than those services 
excluded by statute) that, before July 1, 
1998, were paid under Part B (the 
supplementary medical insurance 
program) but furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries in a SNF during a Part A 
covered stay. (These excluded service 
categories are discussed in greater detail 
in section V.B.2. of the May 12, 1998 
interim final rule (63 FR 26295 through 
26297)). 
2. Methodology Used for the Calculation 
of the Federal Rates 
The proposed FY 2009 rates would 
reflect an update using the full amount 
of the latest market basket index. The 
proposed FY 2009 market basket 
increase factor is 3.1 percent. A 
complete description of the multi-step 
process used to calculate Federal rates 
initially appeared in the May 12, 1998 
interim final rule (63 FR 26252), as 
further revised in subsequent rules. We 
note that in accordance with section 
101(c)(2) of the BBRA, the previous 
temporary increases in the per diem 
adjusted payment rates for certain 
designated RUGs, as specified in section 
101(a) of the BBRA and section 314 of 
the BIPA, are no longer in effect due to 
the implementation of case-mix 
refinements as of January 1, 2006. 
However, the temporary increase of 128 
percent in the per diem adjusted 
payment rates for SNF residents with 
AIDS, enacted by section 511 of the 
MMA, remains in effect. 
We used the SNF market basket to 
adjust each per diem component of the 
Federal rates forward to reflect cost 
increases occurring between the 
midpoint of the Federal FY beginning 
October 1, 2007, and ending September 
30, 2008, and the midpoint of the 
Federal FY beginning October 1, 2008, 
and ending September 30, 2009, to 
which the payment rates apply. In 
accordance with section 
1888(e)(4)(E)(ii)(IV) of the Act, we 
update the payment rates for FY 2009 by 
a factor equal to the full market basket 
index percentage increase. (We note, 
however, that the President’s budget 
currently includes a provision that 
would establish a zero percent market 
basket update for FYs 2009 through 
2011, and that the provisions outlined 
in this proposed rule would need to 
reflect any legislation that the Congress 
may enact to adopt that proposal.) We 
further adjust the rates by a wage index 
budget neutrality factor, described later 
in this section. Tables 2 and 3 reflect the 
updated components of the unadjusted 
Federal rates for FY 2009.

B. Case-Mix Adjustments 
1. Background 
Section 1888(e)(4)(G)(i) of the Act 
requires the Secretary to make an 
adjustment to account for case-mix. The 
statute specifies that the adjustment is 
to reflect both a resident classification 
system that the Secretary establishes to 
account for the relative resource use of 
different patient types, as well as 
resident assessment and other data that 
the Secretary considers appropriate. In 
first implementing the SNF PPS (63 FR 
26252, May 12, 1998), we developed the 
Resource Utilization Groups, version III 
(RUG–III) case-mix classification 
system, which tied the amount of 
payment to resident resource use in 
combination with resident characteristic 
information. Staff time measurement 
(STM) studies conducted in 1990, 1995, 
and 1997 provided information on 
resource use (time spent by staff 
members on residents) and resident 
characteristics that enabled us not only 
to establish RUG–III, but also to create 
case-mix indexes. 
Under the BBA, each update of the 
SNF PPS payment rates must include 
the case-mix classification methodology 
applicable for the coming Federal FY. 
As indicated in section I.F.1 of this 
proposed rule, the payment rates set 
forth herein reflect the use of the refined 
RUG–53 system that we discussed in 
detail in the proposed and final rules for 
FY 2006. 
When we developed the refined RUG– 
53 system, we constructed new case-mix 
indexes, using the Staff Time 
Measurement (STM) study data that was 
collected during the 1990s and 
originally used in creating the SNF PPS 
case-mix classification system and case- 
mix indexes. In section II.B.2 of this 
proposed rule, we discuss further 
adjustments to those new case-mix 
indexes. 
2. Development of the Case-Mix Indexes 
In the SNF PPS final rule for FY 2006 
(70 FR 45032, August 4, 2005), we 
introduced two refinements to the SNF 
PPS: nine new case-mix groups to 
account for the care needs of 
beneficiaries requiring both extensive 
medical and rehabilitation services, and 
an adjustment to reflect the variability 
in the use of non-therapy ancillaries 
(NTAs). We made these refinements by 
using the resource minute data from the 
original 44-group RUG–III model to 
create a new set of relative weights, or 
case-mix indexes (CMIs), for the 53- 
group RUG–III model. We then 
compared the CMIs for the two models 
to ensure that estimated total payments 
under the 53-group model would 
maintain parity to those that would 
have been made under the 44-group 
model. 
In conducting this analysis, we used 
FY 2001 claims data (the most current 
data available at the time) to compare 
the distribution of payment days by 
RUG category in the original, 44-group 
model with anticipated payments by 
RUG category in the refined 53-group 
model. Based on the results of this 
analysis, we adjusted the new CMIs 
upward by applying a parity adjustment 
factor, in order to ensure that the RUG– 
III model was expanded in a budget- 
neutral manner. We then applied a 
second adjustment to the CMIs to 
account for the variability in the use of 
NTA services. These two adjustments 
resulted in a combined 17.9 percent 
increase in the CMIs that went into 
effect on January 1, 2006, as part of the 
case-mix refinement implementation. A 
detailed description of the methods 
used to make these two adjustments to 
the CMIs appears in the SNF PPS 
proposed rule for FY 2006 (70 FR 29077 
through 29078, May 19, 2005). However, 
we recognized that utilization patterns 
change over time, and in the FY 2006 
final rule (70 FR 45031, August 4, 2005), 
we committed to monitoring the 
accuracy and effectiveness of the CMIs 
used in the 53-group model. 
In monitoring recent claims data, we 
observed that actual utilization patterns 
differed significantly from those we had 
projected using the 2001 data. In 
particular, the proportion of patients 
grouped in the highest paying RUG 
categories—combining high therapy 
with extensive services—greatly 
exceeded our projections. We have, 
therefore, used actual claims data to 
recalibrate both of the adjustments to 
the CMIs: the parity adjustment 
designed to make the change from the 
44-group model to the 53-group model 
in a budget-neutral manner, and the 
factor used to recognize the variability 
in NTA utilization. 
To determine the parity adjustment 
factor needed to re-establish budget 
neutrality, we compared simulated CY 
2006 payments (using the most recent 
data available) for the 44-group and 53- 
group RUG–III models using the same 
methodology that we described in the 
SNF PPS proposed rule for FY 2006 (70 
FR 29077 through 29078, May 19, 2005). 
Once we had identified the recalibrated 
parity adjustment factor necessary to re- 
establish budget neutrality, we then 
determined the recalibrated percentage 
adjustment that would be needed to 
reset the NTA component of the CMIs 
at the appropriate level specified in the 
SNF PPS final rule for FY 2006 (70 FR 
45031, August 4, 2005). Under our 
proposed recalibration, these two 
adjustments, which had initially 
produced a combined increase of 17.9 
percent in the FY 2006 refinement, 
would instead result in an overall 9.68 
percent increase for FY 2009. Thus, for 
FY 2009, the aggregate impact of this 
proposed recalibration would be the 
difference between the original, FY 2006 
total increase of 17.9 percent and the 
recalibrated total increase of 9.68 
percent, or a negative $770 million. 
It is extremely important to note that 
this adjustment, as proposed, would be 
made prospectively. However, we are 
responsible for maintaining the fiscal 
integrity of the SNF PPS, and by using 
the actual claims data, the SNF PPS 
would better reflect the resources used, 
resulting in more accurate payment. To 
that end, we have developed our 
proposed recalibration of the parity and 
NTA adjustments to the CMIs using 
actual claims distribution data. 
Although the 2001 data were the best 
source available at the time the FY 2006 
refinements were introduced, the 2006 
data provide the most recent and a more 
accurate source of RUG–53 utilization. 
(We also note that pursuant to our 
ongoing commitment to monitoring the 
accuracy and effectiveness of the CMIs 
under the refined case-mix system, there 
may be further revisions to the 
recalibration as we develop the FY 2009 
final rule, based on the data available at 
that time.) 
We note that the negative $770 
million adjustment described above 
would be largely offset by the FY 2009 
market basket adjustment factor of 3.1 
percent, or $710 million, with a net 
result of a negative annual update of 
approximately $60 million. We are, 
nevertheless, confident that this 
proposed recalibration would achieve 
the goals of the refinement provision 
implemented in January 2006, and that, 
as a result, payments would better 
reflect those policies. We also wish to 
note that after it conducted a thorough 
review of SNF profit margins, MedPAC 
concluded that, in the aggregate, SNFs 
are operating on a sound financial basis. 
As evidenced by MedPAC’s recent 
recommendation for a zero percent 
update for SNFs in FY 2009, we believe 
that this recalibration could be made 
without creating undue hardship on 
providers. 
We list the case-mix adjusted 
payment rates separately for urban and 
rural SNFs in Tables 4 and 5, with the 
corresponding case-mix values. These 
tables do not reflect the AIDS add-on 
enacted by section 511 of the MMA, 
which we apply only after making all 
other adjustments (wage and case-mix).

C. Wage Index Adjustment to Federal 
Rates 
Section 1888(e)(4)(G)(ii) of the Act 
requires that we adjust the Federal rates 
to account for differences in area wage 
levels, using a wage index that we find 
appropriate. Since the inception of a 
PPS for SNFs, we have used hospital 
wage data in developing a wage index 
to be applied to SNFs. We propose to 
continue that practice for FY 2009, as 
we continue to believe that in the 
absence of SNF-specific wage data, 
using the hospital inpatient wage index 
is appropriate and reasonable for the 
SNF PPS. As explained in the update 
notice for FY 2005 (69 FR 45786, July 
30, 2004), the SNF PPS does not use the 
hospital area wage index’s occupational 
mix adjustment, as this adjustment 
serves specifically to define the 
occupational categories more clearly in 
a hospital setting; moreover, the 
collection of the occupational wage data 
also excludes any wage data related to 
SNFs. Therefore, we believe that using 
the updated wage data exclusive of the 
occupational mix adjustment continues 
to be appropriate for SNF payments. 
Since the implementation of the SNF 
PPS, as set forth in § 413.337(a)(1)(ii), a 
SNF’s wage index is determined based 
on the location of the SNF in an urban 
or rural area as defined in § 413.333 and 
further defined in § 412.62(f)(1)(ii) and 
§ 412.62(f)(1)(iii) as urban and rural 
areas, respectively. In the FY 2006 SNF 
PPS final rule (70 FR 45041, August 4, 
2005), we adopted revised labor market 
area definitions based on CBSAs. At the 
time, we noted that these were the same 
labor market area definitions (based on 
OMB’s new CBSA designations) 
implemented under the Hospital 
Inpatient Prospective Payment System 
(IPPS) at § 412.64(b), which were 
effective for those hospitals beginning 
October 1, 2004, as discussed in the 
IPPS final rule for FY 2005 (69 FR at 
49026 through 49034, August 11, 2004). 
In the FY 2006 SNF PPS final rule, we 
inadvertently omitted making a 
conforming regulation text change for 
§ 413.333. However, no change was 
made to our decision to follow the IPPS 
definition of urban and rural. We are 
proposing to make that conforming 
regulation text change to revise the 
definitions for rural and urban areas

25926 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
effective for services provided on or 
after October 1, 2005, to reference the 
regulations at § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(A) 
through (C), consistent with the revision 
under the IPPS. 
1. Clarification of New England Deemed 
Counties 
We are taking this opportunity to 
address the change in the treatment of 
‘‘New England deemed counties’’ (that 
is, those counties in New England listed 
in § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(B) that were deemed 
to be part of urban areas under section 
601(g) of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1983) that was made in 
the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47337 through 
47338, August 22, 2007). These counties 
include the following: Litchfield 
County, Connecticut; York County, 
Maine; Sagadahoc County, Maine; 
Merrimack County, New Hampshire; 
and Newport County, Rhode Island. Of 
these five ‘‘New England deemed 
counties,’’ three (York County, 
Sagadahoc County, and Newport 
County) are also included in 
metropolitan statistical areas defined by 
OMB and are considered urban under 
both the current IPPS and SNF PPS 
labor market area definitions in 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(A). The remaining two, 
Litchfield County and Merrimack 
County, are geographically located in 
areas that are considered rural under the 
current IPPS (and SNF PPS) labor 
market area definitions, but have been 
previously deemed urban under the 
IPPS in certain circumstances, as 
discussed below. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(B) 
was revised such that the two ‘‘New 
England deemed counties’’ that are still 
considered rural under the OMB 
definitions (Litchfield County, CT and 
Merrimack County, NH), are no longer 
considered urban effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 
1, 2007, and therefore, are considered 
rural in accordance with 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C). However, for 
purposes of payment under the IPPS, 
acute-care hospitals located within 
those areas are treated as being 
reclassified to their deemed urban area 
effective for discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2007 (see 72 FR 47337 
through 47338). We note that the SNF 
PPS does not provide for such 
geographic reclassification. Also, in the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47338), we explained that 
we have limited this policy change for 
the ‘‘New England deemed counties’’ 
only to IPPS hospitals, and any change 
to non-IPPS provider wage indexes 
would be addressed in the respective 
payment system rules. Accordingly, we 
are taking this opportunity to clarify the 
treatment of ‘‘New England deemed 
counties’’ under the SNF PPS in this 
proposed rule. 
As discussed above, the SNF PPS has 
consistently used the IPPS definition of 
‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘rural’’ with regard to the 
wage index used in the SNF PPS. 
Historical changes to the labor market 
area/geographic classifications and 
annual updates to the wage index values 
under the SNF PPS are made effective 
October 1 each year. When we 
established the most recent SNF PPS 
payment rate update, effective for SNF 
services provided on or after October 1, 
2007 through September 30, 2008, we 
considered the ‘‘New England deemed 
counties’’ (including Litchfield County, 
CT and Merrimack County, NH) as 
urban for FY 2008, as evidenced by the 
inclusion of Litchfield County as one of 
the constituent counties of urban CBSA 
25540 (Hartford-West Hartford-East 
Hartford, CT), and the inclusion of 
Merrimack County as one of the 
constituent counties of urban CBSA 
31700 (Manchester-Nashua, NH)). 
As noted above, § 413.333 indicates 
that the terms ‘‘rural’’ and ‘‘urban’’ are 
defined according to the definitions of 
those terms as used in the IPPS. 
Applying the IPPS definitions, 
Litchfield County, CT and Merrimack 
County, NH are not considered ‘‘urban’’ 
under § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (B) 
as revised under the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule and, therefore, are considered 
‘‘rural’’ under § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C). 
Accordingly, reflecting our policy to use 
the IPPS definitions of ‘‘urban’’ and 
‘‘rural,’’ these two counties will be 
considered ‘‘rural’’ under the SNF PPS 
effective with the next update of the 
SNF PPS payment rates on October 1, 
2008, and will no longer be included in 
urban CBSA 25540 (Hartford-West 
Hartford-East Hartford, CT) and urban 
CBSA 31700 (Manchester-Nashua, NH), 
respectively. We note that this policy is 
consistent with our policy of not taking 
into account IPPS geographic 
reclassifications in determining 
payments under the SNF PPS. As 
indicated above, we are proposing to 
make a technical change to the 
regulations at § 413.333 to reflect the 
updated IPPS regulation reference. 
2. Multi-Campus Hospital Wage Index 
Data 
In the FY 2008 SNF PPS final rule (72 
FR 43412, August 3, 2007), we 
established SNF PPS wage index values 
for FY 2008 calculated from the same 
data (collected from cost reports 
submitted by hospitals for cost reporting 
periods beginning during FY 2004) used 
to compute the FY 2008 acute care 
hospital inpatient wage index, without 
taking into account geographic 
reclassification under sections 
1886(d)(8) and (d)(10) of the Act. 
However, the IPPS policy that 
apportions the wage data for multi- 
campus hospitals was not finalized 
before the SNF PPS final rule. The SNF 
PPS wage index values applicable for 
services provided on or after October 1, 
2007 through September 30, 2008 are 
shown in Table 8 (for urban areas) and 
Table 9 (for rural areas) and in the 
Addendum to the FY 2008 SNF PPS 
final rule (72 FR 43437 through 43463). 
We are continuing to use IPPS wage 
data for FY 2009 because we believe 
that in the absence of SNF-specific wage 
data, using the hospital inpatient wage 
data is appropriate and reasonable for 
the SNF PPS. We note that the IPPS 
wage data used to determine the 
proposed FY 2009 SNF wage index 
values reflect our policy that was 
adopted under the IPPS beginning in FY 
2008, which apportions the wage data 
for multi-campus hospitals located in 
different labor market areas, or Core- 
Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), to each 
CBSA where the campuses are located 
(see the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 47317 through 
47320)). Specifically, for the proposed 
FY 2009 SNF PPS, the wage index was 
computed using IPPS wage data 
(published by hospitals for cost 
reporting periods beginning in 2005, as 
with the FY 2009 IPPS wage index), 
which allocated salaries and hours to 
the campuses of two multi-campus 
hospitals with campuses that are located 
in different labor areas; one is 
Massachusetts and the other is Illinois. 
The wage index values for the proposed 
FY 2009 SNF PPS in the following 
CBSAs are affected by this policy: 
Boston-Quincy, MA (CBSA 14484), 
Providence-New Bedford-Falls River, 
RI–MA (CBSA 39300), Chicago- 
Naperville-Joliet, IL (CBSA 16974) and 
Lake County-Kenosha County, IL–WI 
(CBSA 29404) (please refer to Table 8 in 
the Addendum of this proposed rule). 
In summary, for FY 2009, we propose 
to use the FY 2009 wage index data 
(collected from cost reports submitted 
by hospitals for cost reporting periods 
beginning during FY 2005) to adjust 
SNF PPS payments beginning October 1, 
2008. These data reflect the multi- 
campus and New England deemed 
counties policies discussed above. 
Finally, we propose to continue using 
the same methodology discussed in the 
SNF PPS final rule for FY 2008 (72 FR 
43423) to address those geographic areas 
in which there are no hospitals and, 
thus, no hospital wage index data on

25927 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
which to base the calculation of the FY 
2009 SNF PPS wage index. For rural 
geographic areas that do not have 
hospitals and, therefore, lack hospital 
wage data on which to base an area 
wage adjustment, we would use the 
average wage index from all contiguous 
CBSAs as a reasonable proxy. This 
methodology is used to construct the 
wage index for rural Massachusetts. 
However, we would not apply this 
methodology to rural Puerto Rico due to 
the distinct economic circumstances 
that exist there, but instead would 
continue using the most recent wage 
index previously available for that area. 
For urban areas without specific 
hospital wage index data, we would use 
the average wage indexes of all of the 
urban areas within the State to serve as 
a reasonable proxy for the wage index 
of that urban CBSA. The only urban area 
without wage index data available is 
CBSA (25980) Hinesville-Fort Stewart, 
GA. 
To calculate the SNF PPS wage index 
adjustment, we would apply the wage 
index adjustment to the labor-related 
portion of the Federal rate, which is 
69.994 percent of the total rate. This 
percentage reflects the labor-related 
relative importance for FY 2009, using 
the revised and rebased FY 2004-based 
market basket. The labor-related relative 
importance for FY 2008 was 70.249, as 
shown in Table 11. We calculate the 
labor-related relative importance from 
the SNF market basket, and it 
approximates the labor-related portion 
of the total costs after taking into 
account historical and projected price 
changes between the base year and FY 
2009. The price proxies that move the 
different cost categories in the market 
basket do not necessarily change at the 
same rate, and the relative importance 
captures these changes. Accordingly, 
the relative importance figure more 
closely reflects the cost share weights 
for FY 2009 than the base year weights 
from the SNF market basket. 
We calculate the labor-related relative 
importance for FY 2009 in four steps. 
First, we compute the FY 2009 price 
index level for the total market basket 
and each cost category of the market 
basket. Second, we calculate a ratio for 
each cost category by dividing the FY 
2009 price index level for that cost 
category by the total market basket price 
index level. Third, we determine the FY 
2009 relative importance for each cost 
category by multiplying this ratio by the 
base year (FY 2004) weight. Finally, we 
add the FY 2009 relative importance for 
each of the labor-related cost categories 
(wages and salaries, employee benefits, 
non-medical professional fees, labor- 
intensive services, and a portion of 
capital-related expenses) to produce the 
FY 2009 labor-related relative 
importance. Tables 6 and 7 below show 
the Federal rates by labor-related and 
non-labor-related components.

25929 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Section 1888(e)(4)(G)(ii) of the Act 
also requires that we apply this wage 
index in a manner that does not result 
in aggregate payments that are greater or 
less than would otherwise be made in 
the absence of the wage adjustment. For 
FY 2009 (Federal rates effective October 
1, 2008), we would apply an adjustment 
to fulfill the budget neutrality 
requirement. We would meet this 
requirement by multiplying each of the 
components of the unadjusted Federal 
rates by a budget neutrality factor equal 
to the ratio of the weighted average 
wage adjustment factor for FY 2008 to 
the weighted average wage adjustment 
factor for FY 2009. For this calculation, 
we use the same 2006 claims utilization 
data for both the numerator and 
denominator of this ratio. We define the 
wage adjustment factor used in this 
calculation as the labor share of the rate 
component multiplied by the wage 
index plus the non-labor share of the 
rate component. The proposed budget 
neutrality factor for this year is 1.0009. 
The wage index applicable to FY 2009 
is set forth in Tables 8 and 9, which 
appear in the Addendum of this 
proposed rule. 
In the SNF PPS final rule for FY 2006 
(70 FR 45026, August 4, 2005), we 
adopted the changes discussed in the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) Bulletin No. 03–04 (June 6, 
2003), available online at 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/ 
b03–04.html, which announced revised 
definitions for Metropolitan Statistical 
Areas (MSAs), and the creation of 
Micropolitan Statistical Areas and 
Combined Statistical Areas. In addition, 
OMB published subsequent bulletins 
regarding CBSA changes, including 
changes in CBSA numbers and titles. As 
indicated in the FY 2008 SNF PPS final 
rule (72 FR 43423, August 3, 2007), this 
and all subsequent SNF PPS rules and 
notices are considered to incorporate 
the CBSA changes published in the 
most recent OMB bulletin that applies 
to the hospital wage data used to 
determine the current SNF PPS wage 
index. The OMB bulletins may be 
accessed online at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/ 
index.html. 
In adopting the OMB Core-Based 
Statistical Area (CBSA) geographic 
designations, we provided for a 1-year 
transition with a blended wage index for 
all providers. For FY 2006, the wage 
index for each provider consisted of a 
blend of 50 percent of the FY 2006 
MSA-based wage index and 50 percent 
of the FY 2006 CBSA-based wage index 
(both using FY 2002 hospital data). We 
referred to the blended wage index as 
the FY 2006 SNF PPS transition wage 
index. As discussed in the SNF PPS 
final rule for FY 2006 (70 FR 45041), 
subsequent to the expiration of this 1- 
year transition on September 30, 2006, 
we used the full CBSA-based wage 
index values, as now presented in 
Tables 8 and 9 of this proposed rule. 
D. Updates to the Federal Rates 
In accordance with section 
1888(e)(4)(E) of the Act, as amended by 
section 311 of the BIPA, the proposed 
payment rates in this proposed rule 
reflect an update equal to the full SNF 
market basket, estimated at 3.1 
percentage points. We would continue 
to disseminate the rates, wage index, 
and case-mix classification methodology 
through the Federal Register before the 
August 1 that precedes the start of each 
succeeding FY. 
E. Relationship of RUG–III Classification 
System to Existing Skilled Nursing 
Facility Level-of-Care Criteria 
As discussed in § 413.345, we include 
in each update of the Federal payment 
rates in the Federal Register the 
designation of those specific RUGs 
under the classification system that 
represent the required SNF level of care, 
as provided in § 409.30. This 
designation reflects an administrative 
presumption under the refined RUG–53 
that beneficiaries who are correctly 
assigned to one of the upper 35 of the 
RUG–53 groups on the initial 5-day, 
Medicare-required assessment are 
automatically classified as meeting the 
SNF level of care definition up to and 
including the assessment reference date 
on the 5-day Medicare required 
assessment. 
A beneficiary assigned to any of the 
lower 18 groups is not automatically 
classified as either meeting or not 
meeting the definition, but instead 
receives an individual level of care 
determination using the existing 
administrative criteria. This 
presumption recognizes the strong 
likelihood that beneficiaries assigned to 
one of the upper 35 groups during the 
immediate post-hospital period require 
a covered level of care, which would be 
significantly less likely for those 
beneficiaries assigned to one of the 
lower 18 groups. 
In this proposed rule, we are 
continuing the designation of the upper 
35 groups for purposes of this 
administrative presumption, consisting 
of the following RUG–53 classifications: 
All groups within the Rehabilitation 
plus Extensive Services category; All 
groups within the Ultra High 
Rehabilitation category; all groups 
within the Very High Rehabilitation 
category; all groups within the High 
Rehabilitation category; all groups 
within the Medium Rehabilitation 
category; all groups within the Low 
Rehabilitation category; all groups 
within the Extensive Services category; 
all groups within the Special Care 
category; and, all groups within the 
Clinically Complex category. 
F. Example of Computation of Adjusted 
PPS Rates and SNF Payment 
Using the hypothetical SNF XYZ 
described in Table 10 below, the 
following shows the adjustments made 
to the Federal per diem rate to compute 
the provider’s actual per diem PPS 
payment. SNF XYZ’s 12-month cost 
reporting period begins October 1, 2008. 
SNF XYZ’s total PPS payment would 
equal $29,719. We derive the Labor and 
Non-labor columns from Table 6 of this 
proposed rule.

25930 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
G. Other Issues 
1. Staff Time and Resource Intensity 
Verification (STRIVE) Project 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘STRIVE Project’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
As noted previously in section II.B.1 
of this proposed rule, section 
1888(e)(4)(G)(i) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to make an adjustment to 
account for case-mix. The statute 
specifies that the adjustment is to reflect 
both a resident classification system that 
the Secretary establishes to account for 
the relative resource use of different 
patient types, as well as resident 
assessment and other data that the 
Secretary considers appropriate. In first 
implementing the SNF PPS (63 FR 
26252, May 12, 1998), we developed the 
RUG-III case-mix classification system, 
which tied the amount of payment to 
resident resource use in combination 
with resident characteristic information. 
Staff time measurement (STM) studies 
conducted in 1990, 1995, and 1997 
provided information on resource use 
(time spent by staff members on 
residents) and resident characteristics 
that enabled us not only to establish 
RUG–III, but also to create case-mix 
indexes. 
Since that time, we have become 
concerned that incentives of the SNF 
PPS and the public reporting of nursing 
home quality measures likely have 
altered industry practices, and have 
affected the nursing resources required 
to treat different types of patients. 
Changes to technology might also have 
affected care methods, while more 
choices in housing alternatives (such as 
assisted living and community housing) 
may have altered the population mix 
served by nursing homes. 
To help ensure that the SNF PPS 
payment rates reflect current practices 
and resource needs, CMS sponsored a 
national nursing home time study, 
STRIVE, which began in the Fall of 
2005. Information collected in STRIVE 
includes the amount of time that staff 
members spend on residents and 
information on residents’’ physical and 
clinical status derived from MDS 
assessment data. 
Two hundred and five nursing homes 
from the following fifteen States and 
jurisdictions volunteered to participate 
in STRIVE: The District of Columbia, 
Nevada, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, 
Montana, New York, Ohio, South 
Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and 
Washington. We are currently analyzing 
staff time and MDS assessment data for 
approximately 9,700 residents. 
Nursing homes with poor survey 
histories or pending enforcement 
actions were excluded from the sample. 
In addition, nursing homes with poor 
quality measure (QM) scores, low 
occupancy rates, or large proportions of 
private pay or pediatric patients were 
also excluded. 
Nursing homes were randomly 
recruited within five strata. The five 
strata follow: Hospital-based facilities; 
facilities with high concentrations of 
residents on ventilators; facilities with 
high concentrations of residents with 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); 
facilities with high concentrations of 
residents on Medicare Part A stays; and 
all other facilities. Facilities with large 
concentrations of residents on 
ventilators, residents with HIV, or 
residents on Part A stays were over- 
sampled in order to assure sufficient 
numbers of residents in those 
populations. Nursing homes were 
voluntarily recruited in random order 
until enough facilities in each targeted 
category agreed to participate. 
Participating facilities included both 
not-for-profit entities and corporations; 
chains and independent operators; 
nursing homes with populations small 
to large in size; and facilities situated in 
urban and rural locations. 
STRIVE began on-site data collection 
at both SNFs and Medicaid Nursing 
Facilities (NFs) in the Spring of 2006. 
STRIVE collected data from both types 
of facilities because almost half of the 
States use a version of the RUG-III 
system for their Medicaid 
reimbursement systems. 
Participating facilities submitted both 
time and MDS assessment data. Nursing 
staff recorded their time over 48 hours. 
Nursing staff included registered nurses, 
licensed practical nurses, and nursing 
aides. Therapy staff recorded their time 
over 7 consecutive days. Therapy staff 
included physical therapists and aides; 
occupational therapists and aides; and 
speech-language pathologists. Each 
nursing home staff member recorded his 
or her time at the facility in different 
categories (for example, resident- 
specific time (RST), non-resident- 
specific time (NRST), unpaid time, and 
non-study time). 
As our analysis continues, we expect 
to introduce changes to the RUG-III 
grouper methodology and clinical 
assessment instrument. Further 
exploration of STRIVE data and possible 
refinements to the SNF PPS may 
ultimately culminate in a new RUG 
model, version IV. 
To date, STRIVE has benefited from 
stakeholder input, starting with the 
December 2005 Open Door Forum to 
which the public was invited. The 
educators, researchers, beneficiary 
advocates, clinicians, consultants, 
government experts, and representatives 
from health care, nursing home, and 
other related industry associations 
serving on the STRIVE technical expert 
panel (TEP) have provided valuable 
insights on topics such as sample 
populations. Beginning in 2005 until its 
most recent February 2008 meeting, the 
TEP has met twice and held two 
teleconferences. Additionally, our 
contractor recently established a smaller 
Analytic Panel consisting of various 
stakeholders who meet regularly with 
our researchers to discuss the analysis 
of the STRIVE data. 
Our preliminary analyses of RUG III- 
related resource times and payment 
rates indicated that, as mentioned 
previously, SNF care patterns have 
changed significantly over the decade 
since we last conducted STMs. We note 
that calculating CMIs based upon 
STRIVE data for use within a RUG-III 
model constructed over a decade ago 
would create methodological challenges 
and, therefore, could only be considered 
an interim step, as we would have to 
reexamine the CMIs after changes to the 
structural model are finalized. We will 
continue to analyze STRIVE data and 
intend to create an updated RUG 
classification structure that would more 
accurately reflect current care practices 
and resource use. Our contractors also 
plan to receive input from the TEP and 
the Analytic Panel to guide the STRIVE 
analysis. We may also use the results of 
the contractors’ analyses to make 
changes to the RUG classification 
structure. It is our intention to introduce 
new case-mix weights in FY 2010 that 
reflect the results of the STRIVE 
analysis and any changes to the RUG 
classification structure.

25931 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Act, as amended by the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 
(OBRA 1987), require the Secretary of 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services (the Secretary) to specify a 
minimum data set of core elements for 
use in conducting comprehensive 
assessments. As stated in § 483.20, 
Medicare- and Medicaid-participating 
nursing homes must conduct ‘‘a 
comprehensive, accurate, standardized, 
reproducible assessment’’ of each 
nursing home resident’s functional 
capacity. 
CMS is developing a new version of 
the MDS, MDS 3.0, to reflect more 
accurately each resident’s clinical, 
cognitive, and functional status as well 
as the care that nursing homes provide 
residents. The regulations at 
§ 483.20(b)(1)(i) through (xviii) list the 
clinical domains that must be included 
in the Resident Assessment Instrument 
(RAI). These domains have been 
incorporated into the MDS 2.0 and 
would also be included in MDS 3.0. We 
anticipate that in FY 2010, MDS 3.0 
would become the current version of the 
MDS. MDS 3.0, like MDS 2.0, would 
focus on the clinical assessment of each 
nursing home resident to screen for 
common, often unrecognized or 
unevaluated, conditions and syndromes. 
We made clinical revisions to the 
instrument based on input from subject- 
area experts, feedback from MDS users, 
resident advocates and families, and 
new knowledge and evidence about 
resident assessment. With the 
implementation of MDS 3.0, we aim to 
increase the clinical relevance, 
accuracy, and efficiency of assessments; 
require assessors to record direct 
resident responses on some items; 
include assessment items used in other 
care settings; and move items toward 
future electronic health record formats. 
On January 24, 2008, CMS hosted a 
special Open Door Forum to provide 
details about MDS 3.0. 
We now plan to evaluate the impact 
of the MDS 3.0 changes on the RUG–III 
resident classification system used in 
the Medicare payment structure. We 
intend to develop ways to adapt the 
RUG system to the MDS 3.0 assessment 
instrument as part of the STRIVE study. 
We would then finalize changes to the 
MDS 3.0 and any necessary adaptations 
to the RUG classification system. Our 
intent would be to implement the 
updated system nationally in FY 2010. 
We are very much aware that the 
transition to a new MDS instrument in 
conjunction with the possible release of 
a new RUG grouper requires careful 
planning and extensive provider 
training. CMS staff are already working 
on training plans that would include a 
new MDS 3.0 manual, documentation 
explaining the updated RUG grouper 
methodology, data specifications for 
providers and vendors, training videos, 
a help desk call and e-mail center, and 
a train-the-trainer conference tentatively 
scheduled for Spring 2009. However, we 
realize that the most effective training 
would require coordination between 
CMS and its key stakeholders, including 
provider and professional associations, 
Fiscal Intermediaries and Part A and 
Part B Medicare Administrative 
Contractors (MACs), and State agencies. 
We want to encourage stakeholders to 
work with CMS staff to provide 
additional training opportunities on the 
local level to ensure a smooth transition. 
We plan to publish a transition plan in 
2008 that should highlight opportunities 
for joint action. In 2009, we intend to 
make draft MDS 3.0 specifications 
available to providers and vendors. We 
also tentatively plan to include in the 
update to the FY 2010 SNF PPS rates 
(which we intend to introduce in Spring 
2009 and finalize by the end of July, 
2009) definitive information on the final 
MDS 3.0 and RUG grouper 
specifications. Additional information is

3. Integrated Post Acute Care Payment 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Integrated Post Acute Care 
Payment’’ at the beginning of your 
comments.] 
Under current law, Medicare covers 
post-acute care (PAC) services in 
various care settings, including SNFs, 
home health agencies (HHAs), long-term 
care hospitals (LTCHs), and inpatient 
rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). Each of 
the PAC sites has a separate payment 
system that relies on different patient 
assessment instruments, although there 
is no mandated assessment instrument 
for LTCHs. The current model is based 
on provider-oriented ‘‘silos’’ with 
significant payment differentials 
existing between provider types that 
treat similar patients and provide 
similar services. 
In the SNF PPS update notice for FY 
2007 (71 FR 43172 through 43173, July 
31, 2006), we described our plans to 
explore refinements to the existing PAC 
payment methodologies to create a more 
seamless system for payment and 
delivery of PAC under Medicare. The 
new model will focus on beneficiary 
needs rather than provider type and will 
be characterized by more consistent 
payments for the same type of care 
across different sites of service, quality- 
driven pay-for-performance incentives, 
and collection of uniform clinical 
assessment information to support 
quality and discharge planning 
functions. 
We also noted in the FY 2007 SNF 
PPS update notice (71 FR 43172) that 
section 5008 of the Deficit Reduction 
Act (DRA) of 2005 mandates a PAC 
payment reform demonstration for 
purposes of understanding costs and 
outcomes across different PAC sites. To 
meet this mandate, CMS implemented 
the PAC Payment Reform 
Demonstration (PAC–PRD) to examine 
differences in costs and outcomes for 
PAC patients of similar case-mix who 
use different types of PAC providers and 
to develop a standardized patient 
assessment tool for use at hospital 
discharge and at PAC admission and 
discharge. This tool, the Continuity 
Assessment Record and Evaluation 
(CARE) tool, will measure the health 
and functional status of Medicare acute 
discharges. During the demonstration, 
CARE will be used at hospital discharge 
and upon admission and discharge from 
PAC settings. The CARE instrument 
consists of a core set of assessment 
items that are common to all patients 
and care settings and are organized 
under several major domains: Medical, 
Functional, Cognitive, Social, and 
Continuity of Care, in addition to 
supplemental items for specific 
conditions and care settings. Additional 
information on the PAC–PRD is 
available at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/

We are interested in receiving public

specifically invite comments on how 
CARE might advance the use of Health 
Information Technology (HIT) in 
automating the process for collecting 
and submitting quality data. The CARE

and Appendix B (‘‘CARE Tool Master 
Document,’’ in Microsoft Word). 
In addition, we wish to take this 
opportunity to discuss recent 
developments in the related area of 
value-based purchasing (VBP). VBP ties 
payment to performance through the use 
of incentives based on measures of 
quality and cost of care. The 
implementation of VBP is rapidly 
transforming CMS from being a passive 
payer of claims to an active purchaser 
of higher quality, more efficient health 
care for Medicare beneficiaries. Our 
VBP initiatives include hospital pay for 
reporting (the Reporting Hospital 
Quality Data for the Annual Payment 
Update Program), physician pay for 
reporting (the Physician Quality 
Reporting Initiative), home health pay 
for reporting, the Hospital VBP Plan 
Report to Congress, and various VBP 
demonstration programs across payment 
settings, including the Premier Hospital 
Quality Incentive Demonstration and 
the Physician Group Practice 
Demonstration. 
The preventable hospital-acquired 
conditions (HAC) payment provision for 
IPPS hospitals is another of CMS’’ 
value-based purchasing initiatives. The 
principal behind the HAC payment 
provision (Medicare not paying more for 
healthcare-associated conditions) could 
be applied to the Medicare payment 
systems for other settings of care. 
Section 1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act 
required the Secretary to select for the 
HAC IPPS payment provision 
conditions that: (a) are high cost, high 
volume, or both; (b) are assigned to a 
higher-paying Medicare severity 
diagnosis-related group (MS–DRG) 
when present as a secondary diagnosis; 
and (c) could reasonably have been 
prevented through the application of 
evidence-based guidelines. Beginning 
October 1, 2008, Medicare can no longer 
assign an inpatient hospital discharge to 
a higher-paying MS–DRG if a selected 
HAC condition was not present on 
admission. That is, the case will be paid 
as though the secondary diagnosis were 
not present. (Medicare will continue to 
assign a discharge to a higher-paying 
MS–DRG in those instances where the 
selected condition was, in fact, present 
on admission). 
The broad principle articulated in the 
HAC payment provision for IPPS 
hospitals—of Medicare not paying for 
these types of preventable conditions— 
could potentially be applied to other 
Medicare payment systems for similar 
conditions that occur in settings other 
than IPPS hospitals. Other possible 
settings of care might include hospital 
outpatient departments, SNFs, HHAs, 
end-stage renal disease facilities, and 
physician practices. The 
implementation would be different for 
each setting, as each payment system is 
different and the reasonable 
preventability through the application 
of evidence-based guidelines could vary 
for candidate conditions over the 
different settings. However, alignment 
of incentives across settings of care is an 
important goal for all of CMS’’ VBP 
initiatives, including the HAC 
provision. 
A related application of the broad 
principle behind the HAC payment 
provision for IPPS hospitals could be 
considered through Medicare secondary 
payer policy by requiring the provider 
that failed to prevent the occurrence of 
a preventable condition in one setting to 
pay for all or part of the necessary 
follow-up care in a second setting. This 
would help shield the Medicare 
program from inappropriately paying for 
the downstream effects of a preventable 
condition acquired in the first setting 
but treated in the second setting. 
We note that we are not proposing 
new Medicare policy in this discussion 
of the possible application of HACs 
payment policy for IPPS hospitals to 
other settings, as some of these 
approaches may require new statutory 
authority. Rather, we are seeking public 
comment on the application of the 
preventable HACs payment provision 
for IPPS hospitals to other Medicare 
payment systems and settings. We look 
forward to working with stakeholders in 
the fight against these preventable 
conditions. 
H. Miscellaneous Technical Corrections 
and Clarifications 
We are also taking the opportunity to 
set forth certain technical corrections 
and clarifications in this proposed rule, 
as discussed below. 
1. Bad Debt Payments 
We are proposing to make a technical 
revision in the SNF PPS regulations at 
§ 413.335(b) to reflect Medicare bad debt 
payments to SNFs. Under section 
1861(v)(1) of the Act and § 413.89 of the 
regulations, Medicare may pay some or 
all of the uncollectible deductible and 
coinsurance amounts to those entities 
paid under a reasonable cost payment 
methodology that are eligible to receive 
payment for ‘‘bad debt’’ as defined in 
§ 413.89(b)(1). Under the original 
reasonable cost SNF payment 
methodology that preceded the 
introduction of the SNF PPS, SNFs did, 
in fact, receive bad debt payments for 
uncollectible SNF coinsurance amounts 
(the SNF benefit has no deductible). As 
we noted in the preamble to the July 30, 
1999 SNF PPS final rule (64 FR 41656), 
while the SNF PPS has maintained this 
longstanding practice of recognizing 
SNF bad debt payments ever since its 
inception, these payments are not 
included within the SNF PPS per diem 
itself, but rather, are claimed on the 
SNF’s Medicare cost report. However, in 
drafting the regulations text in 
§ 413.335(b) on the scope of the SNF 
PPS per diem payment, we 
inadvertently omitted a reference to this 
practice. 
Accordingly, in this proposed rule, 
we now propose to rectify that 
inadvertent omission by adding a new 
clause to § 413.335(b), to clarify that in 
addition to the Federal per diem 
payment amounts, SNFs receive 
payment for bad debts of Medicare 
beneficiaries, as specified in the 
provisions of the regulations at § 413.89. 
We note that those provisions include 
the 30 percent reduction in applicable 
SNF bad debt payments made in 
accordance with section 5004 of the 
DRA, as specified in § 413.89(h)(2). 
Further, we note that the President’s 
budget currently includes a provision 
that would eliminate Medicare bad debt 
payments altogether, and that the 
provisions outlined in this proposed 
rule would need to reflect any 
legislation that the Congress may enact 
to adopt that proposal. Finally, we note 
that our proposed revision is similar to 
language that already appears in the 
regulations text for the inpatient 
psychiatric facility PPS, at 
§ 412.422(b)(2). 
2. Additional Clarifications 
We are also proposing to make 
clarifications in two other areas: When 
a SNF may bill at the default payment 
rate, and the role of rehabilitation 
services evaluations in SNFs. 
A recent analysis of claims data has 
confirmed confusion among providers 
as to when it is permissible to submit a 
claim using the Health Insurance 
Prospective Payment System (HIPPS) 
rate code of AAA00, which is the 
default code. Under the SNF PPS, SNFs 
are required to submit resident 
assessment data according to an 
assessment schedule. When the resident 
assessment is prepared timely, the 
provider should bill the RUG payment 
group that is assigned to the assessment. 
When the SNF fails to comply with the 
assessment schedule, it must file a late 
assessment in order to be paid. In this

25933 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
situation, CMS pays a ‘‘default rate’’— 
a reduced payment made in lieu of the 
full SNF PPS rate that would have been 
paid had the resident been assessed in 
a timely manner. Noncompliance with 
the schedule is determined by the 
assessment reference date (ARD) on the 
resident assessment. 
Program instructions also allow for 
payment at the default rate in the 
following limited circumstances where 
the SNF has failed to assess the 
beneficiary: When the stay is less than 
8 days within a spell of illness; the SNF 
is notified on an untimely basis or is 
unaware of a Medicare Secondary Payer 
denial; the SNF is notified on an 
untimely basis of the revocation of a 
payment ban; the beneficiary requests a 
demand bill; or, the SNF is notified on 
an untimely basis or is unaware of a 
beneficiary’s disenrollment from a 
Medicare Advantage plan. Further 
information regarding these limited 
circumstances can be found in the 
Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part I 
(CMS Pub. 15–1), Chapter 28. 
In circumstances other than those 
described above, no payment is 
available to the SNF where the SNF fails 
to assess the resident. However, even 
when no payment will be made, we 
wish to clarify that the SNF must 
nonetheless submit a claim using the 
HIPPS default rate code and an 
occurrence code 77 indicating provider 
liability in order to ensure that the 
beneficiary’s spell of illness (benefit 
period) is updated. 
We have also recently received 
questions concerning Change Request 
(CR) 5532 (Transmittal no. 73, dated 
June 29, 2007), regarding coverage of 
rehabilitation services in a SNF (see 
CMS Pub. 100–2, Chapter 8, § 30.4.1.1). 
As a result, we wish to clarify the 
requirement that an initial evaluation 
must be completed and the plan of 
treatment developed before recording 
the number of minutes of rehabilitation 
services provided or estimated for each 
discipline on the Resident Assessment 
Instrument (RAI). 
For Medicare to cover rehabilitation 
services in a SNF, the services must be 
directly and specifically related to an 
active written treatment plan that is 
developed before the start of 
rehabilitation services. The plan must 
be based upon an initial evaluation 
performed by a qualified therapist (after 
SNF admission and before the start of 
rehabilitation services in the SNF) and 
must be approved by the physician after 
any needed consultation with the 
qualified therapist. This means that the 
evaluation must have been performed 
for each discipline and the plan of 
treatment developed in order to include 
minutes for each discipline under 
Section P (‘‘Special Treatments and 
Procedures’’) of the Resident 
Assessment Instrument, and also to 
project minutes under Section T 
(‘‘Therapy Supplement for Medicare 
PPS’’) of the Resident Assessment 
Instrument. Section T of the MDS is 
completed for Medicare 5-day 
assessments and in certain cases, when 
a beneficiary is readmitted to the SNF, 
whereas Section P is completed for each 
Medicare-required assessment. In those 
cases where a beneficiary is discharged 
during the SNF stay and later 
readmitted, an initial evaluation must 
be performed upon readmission to the 
SNF, prior to the start of rehabilitation 
services in the SNF. 
III. The Skilled Nursing Facility Market 
Basket Index 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Market Basket Index’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
Section 1888(e)(5)(A) of the Act 
requires us to establish a SNF market 
basket index (input price index), that 
reflects changes over time in the prices 
of an appropriate mix of goods and 
services included in the SNF PPS. This 
proposed rule incorporates the latest 
available projections of the SNF market 
basket index. We will incorporate 
updated projections based on the latest 
available projections when we publish 
the SNF final rule. Accordingly, we 
have developed a SNF market basket 
index that encompasses the most 
commonly used cost categories for SNF 
routine services, ancillary services, and 
capital-related expenses. 
Each year, we calculate a revised 
labor-related share based on the relative 
importance of labor-related cost 
categories in the input price index. 
Table 11 below summarizes the 
proposed updated labor-related share 
for FY 2009.

Source: Global Insight, Inc., formerly DRI-WEFA. 
A. Use of the Skilled Nursing Facility 
Market Basket Percentage 
Section 1888(e)(5)(B) of the Act 
defines the SNF market basket 
percentage as the percentage change in 
the SNF market basket index from the 
average of the previous FY to the 
average of the current FY. For the 
Federal rates established in this 
proposed rule, we use the percentage 
increase in the SNF market basket index 
to compute the update factor for FY 
2009. We use the Global Insight, Inc. 
(formerly DRI–WEFA), first quarter 2008 
forecasted percentage increase in the FY 
2004-based SNF market basket index for 
routine, ancillary, and capital-related 
expenses, described in the previous 
section, to compute the update factor in 
this proposed rule. Finally, as discussed 
in section I.A. of this proposed rule, we 
no longer compute update factors to 
adjust a facility-specific portion of the 
SNF PPS rates because the initial three- 
phase transition period from facility- 
specific to full Federal rates that started 
with cost reporting periods beginning in 
July 1998 has expired. 
B. Market Basket Forecast Error 
Adjustment 
As discussed in the June 10, 2003, 
supplemental proposed rule (68 FR 
34768) and finalized in the August 4,

25934 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
2003, final rule (68 FR 46067), the 
regulations at § 413.337(d)(2) provide 
for an adjustment to account for market 
basket forecast error. The initial 
adjustment applied to the update of the 
FY 2003 rate for FY 2004, and took into 
account the cumulative forecast error for 
the period from FY 2000 through FY 
2002. Subsequent adjustments in 
succeeding FYs take into account the 
forecast error from the most recently 
available FY for which there is final 
data, and apply whenever the difference 
between the forecasted and actual 
change in the market basket exceeds a 
specified threshold. We originally used 
a 0.25 percentage point threshold for 
this purpose; however, for the reasons 
specified in the FY 2008 SNF PPS final 
rule (72 FR 43425, August 3, 2007), we 
adopted a 0.5 percentage point 
threshold effective with FY 2008. As 
discussed previously in section I.F.2. of 
this proposed rule, as the difference 
between the estimated and actual 
amounts of increase in the market 
basket index for FY 2007 (the most 
recently available FY for which there is 
final data) does not exceed the 0.5 
percentage point threshold, the 
proposed payment rates for FY 2009 do 
not include a forecast error adjustment. 
C. Federal Rate Update Factor 
Section 1888(e)(4)(E)(ii)(IV) of the Act 
requires that the update factor used to 
establish the FY 2009 Federal rates be 
at a level equal to the full market basket 
percentage change. Accordingly, to 
establish the update factor, we 
determined the total growth from the 
average market basket level for the 
period of October 1, 2007 through 
September 30, 2008 to the average 
market basket level for the period of 
October 1, 2008 through September 30, 
2009. Using this process, the proposed 
market basket update factor for FY 2009 
SNF Federal rates is 3.1 percent. We 
used this revised proposed update factor 
to compute the Federal portion of the 
SNF PPS rate shown in Tables 2 and 3. 
IV. Consolidated Billing 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Consolidated Billing’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
Section 4432(b) of the BBA 
established a consolidated billing 
requirement that places the Medicare 
billing responsibility for virtually all of 
the services that the SNF’s residents 
receive on the SNF, except for a small 
number of services that the statute 
specifically identifies as being excluded 
from this provision. As noted previously 
in section I. of this proposed rule, 
subsequent legislation enacted a number 
of modifications in the consolidated 
billing provision. 
Specifically, section 103 of the BBRA 
amended this provision by further 
excluding a number of individual ‘‘high- 
cost, low-probability’’ services, 
identified by the Healthcare Common 
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) 
codes, within several broader categories 
(chemotherapy and its administration, 
radioisotope services, and customized 
prosthetic devices) that otherwise 
remained subject to the provision. We 
discuss this BBRA amendment in 
greater detail in the proposed and final 
rules for FY 2001 (65 FR 19231 through 
19232, April 10, 2000, and 65 FR 46790 
through 46795, July 31, 2000), as well as 
in Program Memorandum AB–00–18 
(Change Request #1070), issued March 
2000, which is available online at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/transmittals/ 
downloads/ab001860.pdf. 
Section 313 of the BIPA further 
amended this provision by repealing its 
Part B aspect; that is, its applicability to 
services furnished to a resident during 
a SNF stay that Medicare does not 
cover. (However, physical, 
occupational, and speech-language 
therapy remain subject to consolidated 
billing, regardless of whether the 
resident who receives these services is 
in a covered Part A stay.) We discuss 
this BIPA amendment in greater detail 
in the proposed and final rules for FY 
2002 (66 FR 24020 through 24021, May 
10, 2001, and 66 FR 39587 through 
39588, July 31, 2001). 
In addition, section 410 of the MMA 
amended this provision by excluding 
certain practitioner and other services 
furnished to SNF residents by RHCs and 
FQHCs. We discuss this MMA 
amendment in greater detail in the 
update notice for FY 2005 (69 FR 
45818–45819, July 30, 2004), as well as 
in Program Transmittal #390 (Change 
Request #3575), issued December 10, 
2004, which is available online at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/transmittals/
downloads/r390cp.pdf. 
To date, the Congress has enacted no 
further legislation affecting the 
consolidated billing provision. 
However, as noted above and explained 
in the proposed rule for FY 2001 (65 FR 
19232, April 10, 2000), the amendments 
enacted in section 103 of the BBRA not 
only identified for exclusion from this 
provision a number of particular service 
codes within four specified categories 
(that is, chemotherapy items, 
chemotherapy administration services, 
radioisotope services, and customized 
prosthetic devices), but also gave the 
Secretary ‘‘* * * the authority to 
designate additional, individual services 
for exclusion within each of the 
specified service categories.’’ In the 
proposed rule for FY 2001, we also 
noted that the BBRA Conference report 
(H.R. Rep. No. 
106–479 at 854 (1999) (Conf. Rep.)) 
characterizes the individual services 
that this legislation targets for exclusion 
as, ‘‘* * * high-cost, low probability 
events that could have devastating 
financial impacts because their costs far 
exceed the payment [SNFs] receive 
under the prospective payment system 
* * *’’. According to the conferees, 
section 103(a), ‘‘is an attempt to exclude 
from the PPS certain services and costly 
items that are provided infrequently in 
SNFs * * *’’. By contrast, we noted that 
the Congress declined to designate for 
exclusion any of the remaining services 
within those four categories (thus 
leaving all of those services subject to 
SNF consolidated billing), because they 
are relatively inexpensive and are 
furnished routinely in SNFs. 
As we further explained in the final 
rule for FY 2001 (65 FR 46790, July 31, 
2000), and as our longstanding policy, 
any additional service codes that we 
might designate for exclusion under our 
discretionary authority must meet the 
same criteria that the Congress used in 
identifying the original codes excluded 
from consolidated billing under section 
103(a) of the BBRA: they must fall 
within one of the four service categories 
specified in the BBRA, and they also 
must meet the same standards of high 
cost and low probability in the SNF 
setting. Accordingly, we characterized 
this statutory authority to identify 
additional service codes for exclusion 
‘‘* * * as essentially affording the 
flexibility to revise the list of excluded 
codes in response to changes of major 
significance that may occur over time 
(for example, the development of new 
medical technologies or other advances 
in the state of medical practice)’’ (65 FR 
46791). In this proposed rule, we 
specifically invite public comments 
identifying codes in any of these four 
service categories (chemotherapy items, 
chemotherapy administration services, 
radioisotope services, and customized 
prosthetic devices) representing recent 
medical advances that might meet our 
criteria for exclusion from SNF 
consolidated billing. 
We note that the original BBRA 
legislation (as well as the implementing 
regulations) identified a set of excluded 
services by means of specifying HCPCS 
codes that were in effect as of a 
particular date (in that case, as of July 
1, 1999). Identifying the excluded 
services in this manner made it possible 
for us to utilize program issuances as 
the vehicle for accomplishing routine 
updates of the excluded codes, in order

to reflect any minor revisions that might 
subsequently occur in the coding system 
itself (for example, the assignment of a 
different code number to the same 
service). Accordingly, in the event that 
we identify through the current 
rulemaking cycle any new services that 
would actually represent a substantive 
change in the scope of the exclusions 
from SNF consolidated billing, we 
would identify these additional 
excluded services by means of the 
HCPCS codes that are in effect as of a 
specific date (in this case, as of October 
1, 2008). By making any new exclusions 
in this manner, we could similarly 
accomplish routine future updates of 
these additional codes through the 
issuance of program instructions. 
V. Application of the SNF PPS to SNF 
Services Furnished by Swing-Bed 
Hospitals 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Swing-Bed Hospitals’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
In accordance with section 1888(e)(7) 
of the Act, as amended by section 203 
of the BIPA, Part A pays CAHs on a 
reasonable cost basis for SNF services 
furnished under a swing-bed agreement. 
However, effective with cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 
2002, the swing-bed services of non- 
CAH rural hospitals are paid under the 
SNF PPS. As explained in the final rule 
for FY 2002 (66 FR 39562, July 31, 
2001), we selected this effective date 
consistent with the statutory provision 
to integrate swing-bed rural hospitals 
into the SNF PPS by the end of the SNF 
transition period, June 30, 2002. 
Accordingly, all non-CAH swing-bed 
rural hospitals have come under the 
SNF PPS as of June 30, 2003. Therefore, 
all rates and wage indexes outlined in 
earlier sections of this proposed rule for 
the SNF PPS also apply to all non-CAH 
swing-bed rural hospitals. A complete 
discussion of assessment schedules, the 
MDS and the transmission software 
(RAVEN–SB for Swing Beds) appears in 
the final rule for FY 2002 (66 FR 39562, 
July 31, 2001). The latest changes in the 
MDS for swing-bed rural hospitals 
appear on our SNF PPS Web site, 
www.cms.hhs.gov/snfpps. 
VI. Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Provisions of the Proposed 
Rule’’ at the beginning of your 
comments.] 
In this proposed rule, in addition to 
accomplishing the required annual 
update of the SNF PPS payment rates, 
we also propose making the following 
revisions in the regulations text: 
• Revise the existing SNF PPS 
definitions of ‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘rural’’ areas 
that appear in § 413.333 to include 
updated cross-references to the 
corresponding IPPS definitions in Part 
412, subpart D. 
• Make a technical revision at 
§ 413.335(b) to reflect Medicare bad debt 
payments to SNFs. 
VII. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Collection of Information’’ at 
the beginning of your comments.] 
This document does not impose 
information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements. 
Consequently, it need not be reviewed 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget under the authority of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 
VIII. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘Impact Analysis’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
A. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 (September 1993, Regulatory 
Planning and Review), the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (September 19, 1980, 
RFA, Pub. L. 96–354), section 1102(b) of 
the Social Security Act (the Act), the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(UMRA, Pub. L. 104–4), Executive Order 
13132 on Federalism, and the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 
804(2)). 
Executive Order 12866, as amended, 
directs agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). A regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA) must be prepared for major rules 
with economically significant effects 
($100 million or more in any 1 year). 
This proposed rule is a major rule, as 
defined in Title 5, United States Code, 
section 804(2), because we estimate the 
FY 2009 impact reflects a $710 million 
increase from the update to the payment 
rates and a $770 million reduction from 
the recalibration of the case-mix 
adjustment, thereby yielding a net 
decrease of $60 million on payments to 
SNFs. 
The proposed update set forth in this 
proposed rule would apply to payments 
in FY 2009. Accordingly, the analysis 
that follows only describes the impact of 
this single year. In accordance with the 
requirements of the Act, we will publish 
a notice for each subsequent FY that 
will provide for an update to the 
payment rates and include an associated 
impact analysis. 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
entities. For purposes of the RFA, small 
entities include small businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and small 
government jurisdictions. Most SNFs 
and most other providers and suppliers 
are small entities, either by their 
nonprofit status or by having revenues 
of $11.5 million or less in any 1 year. 
For purposes of the RFA, approximately 
53 percent of SNFs are considered small 
businesses according to the Small 
Business Administration’s latest size 
standards, with total revenues of $11.5 
million or less in any 1 year (for further 
information, see 65 FR 69432, 
November 17, 2000). Individuals and 
States are not included in the definition 
of a small entity. In addition, 
approximately 29 percent of SNFs are 
nonprofit organizations. 
This proposed rule would update the 
SNF PPS rates published in the final 
rule for FY 2008 (72 FR 43412, August 
3, 2007) and the associated correction 
notices (72 FR 55085, September 28, 
2007, and 72 FR 67652, November 30, 
2007), thereby decreasing net payments 
by an estimated $60 million. As 
indicated in Table 12, the effect on 
facilities will be a net negative impact 
of 0.3 percent. The total impact reflects 
a $770 million reduction from the 
recalibration of the case-mix 
adjustment, offset by a $710 million 
increase from the update to the payment 
rates. We note that some individual 
providers may experience a net increase 
in payments while most others 
experience a decrease. This is due to the 
distributional impact of the FY 2009 
wage indexes and the degree of 
Medicare utilization. While this 
proposed rule is considered major, its 
relative impact on SNFs overall is 
extremely small; that is, less than 3 
percent of total SNF revenues from all 
payor sources. Therefore, the Secretary 
has determined that this proposed rule 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires us to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis if a rule may have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to

25936 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 89 / Wednesday, May 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
the provisions of section 603 of the 
RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of 
the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside of 
a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has 
fewer than 100 beds. The proposed rule 
will affect small rural hospitals that (a) 
furnish SNF services under a swing-bed 
agreement or (b) have a hospital-based 
SNF. We anticipate that the impact on 
small rural hospitals will be similar to 
the impact on SNF providers overall. 
Section 202 of UMRA also requires 
that agencies assess anticipated costs 
and benefits before issuing any rule 
whose mandates require spending in 
any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 
dollars, updated annually for inflation. 
In 2008, that threshold is approximately 
$130 million. This proposed rule would 
not have a substantial effect on the 
governments mentioned, or on private 
sector costs. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates 
regulations that impose substantial 
direct requirement costs on State and 
local governments, preempts State law, 
or otherwise has Federalism 
implications. As stated above, this 
proposed rule would have no 
substantial effect on State and local 
governments. 
B. Anticipated Effects 
This proposed rule sets forth 
proposed updates of the SNF PPS rates 
contained in the final rule for FY 2008 
(72 FR 43412, August 3, 2007) and the 
associated correction notices (72 FR 
55085, September 28, 2007, and 72 FR 
67652, November 30, 2007). Based on 
the above, we estimate the FY 2009 
impact would be a net decrease of $60 
million on payments to SNFs (this 
reflects a $770 million reduction from 
the recalibration of the case-mix 
adjustment, offset by a $710 million 
increase from the update to the payment 
rates. The impact analysis of this 
proposed rule represents the projected 
effects of the changes in the SNF PPS 
from FY 2008 to FY 2009. We estimate 
the effects by estimating payments 
while holding all other payment 
variables constant. We use the best data 
available, but we do not attempt to 
predict behavioral responses to these 
changes, and we do not make 
adjustments for future changes in such 
variables as days or case-mix. 
We note that certain events may 
combine to limit the scope or accuracy 
of our impact analysis, because an 
analysis is future-oriented and, thus, 
very susceptible to forecasting errors 
due to other changes in the forecasted 
impact time period. Some examples of 
possible events are newly-legislated 
general Medicare program funding 
changes by the Congress, or changes 
specifically related to SNFs. In addition, 
changes to the Medicare program may 
continue to be made as a result of 
previously-enacted legislation, or new 
statutory provisions. Although these 
changes may not be specific to the SNF 
PPS, the nature of the Medicare program 
is that the changes may interact, and the 
complexity of the interaction of these 
changes could make it difficult to 
predict accurately the full scope of the 
impact upon SNFs. 
In accordance with section 
1888(e)(4)(E) of the Act, we update the 
payment rates for FY 2008 by a factor 
equal to the full market basket index 
percentage increase plus the FY 2007 
forecast error adjustment to determine 
the payment rates for FY 2009. The 
special AIDS add-on established by 
section 511 of the MMA remains in 
effect until ‘‘* * *such date as the 
Secretary certifies that there is an 
appropriate adjustment in the case mix. 
* * *’’ We have not provided a separate 
impact analysis for the MMA provision. 
Our latest estimates indicate that there 
are less than 2,700 beneficiaries who 
qualify for the AIDS add-on payment. 
The impact to Medicare is included in 
the ‘‘total’’ column of Table 12. In 
proposing to update the rates for FY 
2009, standard annual revisions and 
clarifications mentioned elsewhere in 
this proposed rule (for example, the 
update to the wage and market basket 
indexes used for adjusting the Federal 
rates). These revisions would increase 
payments to SNFs by approximately 
$710 million. 
The net decrease in payments 
associated with this proposed rule is 
estimated to be $60 million for FY 2009. 
The decrease of $770 million due to the 
recalibration of the case-mix 
adjustment, together with the market 
basket increase of $710 million, results 
in a net decrease of $60 million. 
The impacts are shown in Table 12. 
The breakdown of the various categories 
of data in the table follows. 
The first column shows the 
breakdown of all SNFs by urban or rural 
status, hospital-based or freestanding 
status, and census region. 
The first row of figures in the first 
column describes the estimated effects 
of the various changes on all facilities. 
The next six rows show the effects on 
facilities split by hospital-based, 
freestanding, urban, and rural 
categories. The urban and rural 
designations are based on the location of 
the facility under the CBSA designation. 
The next twenty-two rows show the 
effects on urban versus rural status by 
census region. 
The second column in the table shows 
the number of facilities in the impact 
database. 
The third column of the table shows 
the effect of the annual update to the 
wage index. This represents the effect of 
using the most recent wage data 
available. The total impact of this 
change is zero percent; however, there 
are distributional effects of the change. 
The fourth column shows the effect of 
recalibrating the two adjustments (parity 
and NTA) to the CMIs. As explained 
previously in section II.B.2 of this 
proposed rule, we are proposing this 
recalibration so that the CMIs more 
accurately reflect parity in expenditures 
under the refined, 53-group RUG system 
introduced in 2006 relative to payments 
made under the original, 44-group RUG 
system, and in order to keep the NTA 
component at the appropriate level 
specified in the FY 2006 SNF PPS final 
rule. The total impact of this change is 
a decrease of 3.3 percent. We note that 
some individual providers may 
experience larger decreases in payments 
than others due to case-mix utilization. 
The fifth column shows the effect of 
all of the changes on the FY 2009 
payments. The market basket increase of 
3.1 percentage points is constant for all 
providers and, though not shown 
individually, is included in the total 
column. It is projected that aggregate 
payments will decrease by 0.3 percent, 
assuming facilities do not change their 
care delivery and billing practices in 
response. 
As can be seen from this table, the 
combined effects of all of the changes 
vary by specific types of providers and 
by location. For example, though most 
facilities experience payment decreases, 
some providers (for example, those in 
the urban Pacific region) show an 
increase of 1.0 percent. Payment 
increases for facilities in the urban and 
rural Pacific areas of the country are the 
highest for any of the provider 
categories.

C. Alternatives Considered 
Section 1888(e) of the Act establishes 
the SNF PPS for the payment of 
Medicare SNF services for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after July 1, 
1998. This section of the statute 
prescribes a detailed formula for 
calculating payment rates under the 
SNF PPS, and does not provide for the 
use of any alternative methodology. It 
specifies that the base year cost data to 
be used for computing the SNF PPS 
payment rates must be from FY 1995 
(October 1, 1994, through September 30, 
1995.) In accordance with the statute, 
we also incorporated a number of 
elements into the SNF PPS (for example, 
case-mix classification methodology, the 
MDS assessment schedule, a market 
basket index, a wage index, and the 
urban and rural distinction used in the 
development or adjustment of the 
Federal rates). Further, section 
1888(e)(4)(H) of the Act specifically 
requires us to disseminate the payment 
rates for each new FY through the 
Federal Register, and to do so before the 
August 1 that precedes the start of the 
new FY. Accordingly, we are not 
pursuing alternatives with respect to the 
payment methodology as discussed 
above. 
The proposed rule would recalibrate 
the case-mix adjustment to the case-mix 
indexes based on actual CY 2006 data 
instead of continuing to use FY 2001 
data, in order to make the change from 
the 44-group RUG model to the refined 
53-group model in a budget-neutral 
manner, as described in section II.B.2. 
In the FY 2006 SNF PPS final rule (70 
FR 45031, August 4, 2005), we 
committed to monitoring the accuracy 
and effectiveness of the case-mix 
indexes used in the 53-group model. We 
believe that using actual data instead of 
superseded historical data better meets 
our objective of paying SNFs more 
accurately. 
We considered various options for 
implementing the revised case-mix 
adjustment. For example, we considered 
implementing partial adjustments to the 
case-mix indexes over multiple years 
until parity was achieved. However, we 
believe that these options would further 
delay moving to the most appropriate 
payment amounts. Moreover, in 
anticipation of the possible changes 
resulting from STRIVE in the RUG–III 
structural model and the CMIs used in 
payment, we believe it is important for 
the recalibration to be entirely 
completed beforehand, in order to 
ensure stability in the base as we move 
forward with these other changes. 
We also considered introducing new 
case-mix weights derived from the 
STRIVE time study data. However, our 
initial analyses show that it would be 
more efficient and less burdensome to 
providers to introduce any new case- 
mix weights as part of an overall 
restructuring of the RUG–III model that 
is currently scheduled for October 2009. 
D. Accounting Statement 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a-4.pdf), in Table 13 below, we 
have prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the 
provisions of this proposed rule. This 
table provides our best estimate of the 
change in Medicare payments under the 
SNF PPS as a result of the policies in 
this proposed rule based on the data for 
15,346 SNFs in our database. All 
expenditures are classified as transfers 
to Medicare providers (that is, SNFs). 
TABLE 13.—ACCOUNTING STATEMENT: 
CLASSIFICATION OF ESTIMATED EX-

From Whom To 
Whom?.
SNF Medicare Providers 
to Federal Government 
* The net decrease of $60 million in transfer 
payments is a result of the decrease of $770 
million due to the proposed recalibration of the 
case-mix adjustment, together with the pro-
posed market basket increase of $710 million. 
E. Conclusion 
Overall estimated payments for SNFs 
in FY 2009 are projected to decrease by 
0.3 percent compared with those in FY 
2008. We estimate that SNFs in urban 
areas would experience a 0.3 percent 
decrease in estimated payments 
compared with FY 2008. We estimate 
that SNFs in rural areas would 
experience a 0.2 percent decrease in 
estimated payments compared with FY 
2008. Providers in the urban Pacific 
region and the rural Pacific region show 
increases in payments of 1.0 and 0.9 
percent, respectively. 
Finally, in accordance with the 
provisions of Executive Order 12866, 
this regulation was reviewed by the 
Office of Management and Budget.
