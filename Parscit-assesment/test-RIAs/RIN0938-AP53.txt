I. Background 
A. Availability and Redistribution of 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
(CHIP) Fiscal Year Allotments Prior to 
CHIPRA 
Title XXI of the Social Security Act 
(the Act) sets forth the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP) to enable 
States, the District of Columbia, and 
specified Commonwealths and 
Territories to initiate and expand health 
insurance coverage to uninsured, low- 
income children. The 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealths and Territories may 
implement the CHIP through a separate 
child health program under title XXI of 
the Act, an expanded Medicaid program 
under title XIX of the Act, or a 
combination of both. 
Federal funds appropriated for title 
XXI are limited, and the law specifies a 
formula and methodology to divide the 
total annual appropriation into 
individual allotments available for each 
State, the District of Columbia, and each 
U.S. Territory and Commonwealth with 
an approved child health plan. 
Section 2104(b) of the Act requires 
States, the District of Columbia, and 
U.S. Territories and Commonwealths to 
have an approved child health plan for 
the fiscal year in order for the Secretary 
to provide an allotment for that fiscal 
year. 
Before the enactment of the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program 
Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA, 
Pub. L. 111–3, enacted on February 4, 
2009), section 2104(e) of the Act 
specified that in general the CHIP 
allotments for a Federal fiscal year were 
available for payment to States for their 
expenditures under an approved State 
child health plan for an initial 3-fiscal 
year period of availability, including the 
fiscal year for which the allotment was 
provided. 
In general, before the enactment of 
CHIPRA, section 2104(f) of the Act 
specified that the amounts of States’ 
allotments which were not expended 
during the initial 3-year period of 
availability were to be redistributed to 
those States that had fully spent these 
fiscal year allotments during this period 
of availability in accordance with an 
appropriate procedure determined by 
the Secretary. Furthermore, section 
2104(e) of the Act specified that the 
amounts of the redistributed allotments 
continued to be available for 
expenditure by the States receiving 
these redistributions to the end of the 
fiscal year in which these funds were 
redistributed. 
B. Funding of CHIP Allotments Before 
the Enactment of CHIPRA 
Section 4901 of the Balanced Budget 
Act of 1997 (BBA, Pub. L. 105–33, 
enacted on August 5, 1997) established 
title XXI of the Social Security Act (the 
Act). In conjunction with further 
amendments of title XXI of the Act 
described later, appropriations for CHIP 
were made available to provide 
allotments to States for their CHIPs and 
related Medicaid program expenditures 
through March 31, 2009. With the 
enactment of the CHIPRA, title XXI was 
amended to provide funding for the 
CHIP through FY 2013. 
Under the initial BBA, sections 
2104(a)(1) through (10) of the Act 
appropriated funding for States’ CHIPs 
for each fiscal year over a ten fiscal year 
period from 1998 through 2007. The 
funding for each fiscal year varied from 
$4.295 billion for FY 1998 up to $5.0 
billion for FY 2007. Furthermore, under 
section 2104(c)(4) of the Act, additional 
appropriations were provided for each 
of fiscal years 1999 through 2007 to 
provide additional allotment amounts

particularly for the Commonwealths and 
Territories. 
C. Enactment of Continuing 
Appropriations and Medicare, 
Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 
2007 
Continuing appropriation legislation 
(Pub. L. 110–92 enacted on September 
29, 2007), contained provisions to 
extend funding under the CHIP through 
November 16, 2007. In particular, 
section 136(a) of Public Law 110–92 
appropriated $5 billion for the purposes 
of providing FY 2008 allotments to the 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
the Commonwealths and Territories. 
Additionally, $40 million was 
appropriated by this section to provide 
additional allotments to the 
Commonwealths and Territories in FY 
2008. 
Section 136(b) of Public Law 110–92 
provided that the FY 2008 allotments be 
determined in accordance with the same 
methodology as previous CHIP fiscal 
year allotments were determined. 
Section 136(c) of Public Law 110–92 
amended the CHIP statute to add a new 
section 2104(i) of the Act to provide for 
the redistribution in FY 2008 of the 
unexpended FY 2005 allotments 
remaining at the end of FY 2007 to those 
50 States or the District of Columbia that 
had estimated shortfalls in FY 2008. 
Finally, section 106 of Public Law 110– 
92 provided that the FY 2008 allotment 
funds were only available for States’ 
CHIP expenditures for assistance 
provided through November 16, 2007. 
Subsequent to the enactment of Public 
Law 110–92, further continuing 
appropriation legislation was enacted 
which extended the dates through 
which the FY 2008 allotment funds 
were available as provided in section 
106 of Public Law 110–92; in particular, 
Public Law 110–116 (enacted on 
November 13, 2007), Public Law 110– 
137 (enacted on December 14, 2007), 
and Public Law 110–149 (enacted on 
December 21, 2007) extended the dates 
to December 14, 2007, December 21, 
2007, and December 31, 2007, 
respectively. 
Section 201 of the Medicare, 
Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 
2007 (MMSEA, Pub. L. 110–173, 
enacted on December 29, 2007) 
amended section 2104(a) of the CHIP 
statute to explicitly provide funding for 
CHIP allotments in the amount of $5 
billion for each of FYs 2008 and 2009 
for the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia and the Commonwealths and 
Territories, and for $40 million for the 
Commonwealths and Territories for 
each of FY 2008 and FY 2009. These 
allotments would be determined in 
accordance with the existing 
methodology in CHIP statute for fiscal 
years before FY 2008. The funding 
provided for FY 2008 under the 
continuing appropriation legislation 
discussed above and enacted before 
MMSEA would no longer be available 
(and thus expenditures for FY 2008 
would be paid from the allotments as 
provided under MMSEA). MMSEA 
provided that the FY 2008 and FY 2009 
allotment funds were only available for 
States’ expenditures through March 31, 
2009. 
Section 201 of MMSEA amended the 
CHIP statute to add section 2104(j) of 
the Act which appropriated $1.6 billion 
for the purpose of providing additional 
allotments to eliminate States’ CHIP 
shortfalls in FY 2008. 
The provisions of MMSEA were 
implemented and described in the 
Federal Register dated May 23, 2008 
(30112, Vol. 73, No. 101). 
D. Enactment of CHIPRA 
Section 101 of the CHIPRA amended 
section 2104(a) of the Act to appropriate 
funding for each fiscal year FY 2009 
through FY 2012, and for two semi- 
annual periods in FY 2013, October 1, 
2012 through March 31, 2013 and April 
1, 2013 through September 30, 2013, for 
the purpose of providing allotments to 
States for each of those fiscal years or 
fiscal year periods. Furthermore, section 
108 of CHIPRA provided additional 
funding for State allotments for the 
period October 1, 2012 through March 
31, 2013 (the first half of FY 2013). 
Finally, section 3(c) of CHIPRA provides 
for the coordination of funding for the 
CHIP in FY 2009 as previously provided 
under section 201 of MMSEA. 
In particular, section 3(c) of CHIPRA 
requires the Federal government to 
rescind any of the following previously 
appropriated amounts that were not 
allotted or obligated before April 1, 
2009: 
• Section 2104(a)(11) of the Act for 
purposes of providing State CHIP 
allotments for FY 2009 for States’ 
expenditures through March 31, 2009. 
• Section 2104(k) of the Act for 
purposes of the redistribution of 
unexpended FY 2006 allotments in FY 
2009 to address States’ funding 
shortfalls in FY 2009. 
• Section 2104(l) of the Act for 
purposes of providing additional 
allotments for States’ expenditures in 
FY 2009 to fund States’ shortfalls for 
their expenditures through March 31, 
2009. 
Furthermore, any amounts provided 
for FY 2009 CHIP allotments under 
section 2104(a)(12) as appropriated 
through the amendments made by 
CHIPRA must be reduced by the 
amounts that were obligated before 
April 1, 2009 under sections 
2104(a)(11), 2104(k), or 2104(l) of the 
Act, as amended by section 201 of 
MMSEA (which refer to States’ FY 2009 
CHIP allotments, amounts of 
unexpended FY 2006 allotments 
redistributed in FY 2009, and the 
amounts of additional FY 2009 
allotments to address States’ CHIP 
funding shortfalls through March 31, 
2009, respectively). 
The rescission of these unobligated 
amounts as well as the reduction in the 
FY 2009 allotment for the amounts that 
were obligated before April 1, 2009 
ensure that States do not receive FY 
2009 allotments as determined under 
the CHIPRA in excess of the total 
amount provided under section 
2104(a)(12) of the Act for FY 2009, as 
amended by CHIPRA. 
E. Expenditures, Authority for 
Qualifying States To Use Available 
CHIP Allotments for Medicaid 
Expenditures 
Under section 2105(a)(1)(A) through 
(D) and (a)(2) of the Act, and before 
enactment of Public Law 108–74 
(Extension of Availability of CHIP 
Allotment Act, enacted on August 15, 
2003), only Federal payments for the 
following Medicaid and CHIP 
expenditures were applied against 
States’ available CHIP allotments: (1) 
Medical assistance provided under title 
XIX (Medicaid) to targeted low-income 
children in a CHIP-related Medicaid 
expansion, for which the CHIP 
enhanced Federal medical assistance 
percentage (CHIP EFMAP) rate is 
available; (2) medical assistance 
provided on behalf of a child during a 
period of presumptive eligibility under 
section 1920A of the Act (these funds 
are matched at the regular Medicaid 
Federal medical assistance percentage 
(FMAP) rate); (3) child health assistance 
to targeted low-income children that 
meets minimum benefit requirements 
under CHIP; and (4) certain other types 
of expenditures in CHIP that are subject 
to the 10-percent limit on non-primary 
expenditures (including other child 
health assistance for targeted low- 
income children, health services 
initiatives, outreach, and administrative 
costs). 
Section 1(b) of Public Law 108–74, as 
amended by Public Law 108–127 (Social 
Security Act, Technical corrections, 
enacted November 17, 2003), added new 
section 2105(g) to the Act under which 
certain ‘‘qualifying States’’ that met 
prescribed criteria could elect to use up 
to 20 percent of any of the States’ 
available CHIP allotments for FY 1998,

47520 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 178 / Wednesday, September 16, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
1999, 2000, or 2001 to increase the 
FMAP rate for certain regular Medicaid 
expenditures to the EFMAP rate 
available under CHIP. These 
expenditures were for children under 19 
years of age whose family income 
exceeds 150 percent of the Federal 
poverty line and who are eligible under 
the States’ Medicaid program. As 
described in the Federal Register 
published on July 23, 2004 (69 FR 
44013), if a qualified State submitted 
both 20 percent allowance expenditures 
and other ‘‘regular’’ CHIP expenditures 
at the same time in a quarter, the 20 
percent allowance expenditures would 
be applied first against the available 
fiscal year reallotments. However, the 
20 percent allowance expenditures 
could be applied only against the 
specified fiscal year allotment funds 
(upon which the 20 percent allowances 
were based) and which would remain 
available. Under section 
2104(g)(1)(B)(iii) of the Act, the amounts 
of States’ FY 2001 reallotments would 
only be available through the end of FY 
2005; therefore, the FY 2001 20 percent 
allowances for the qualifying States are 
only available through the end of FY 
2005. 
Section 6103 of the Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109–171, enacted 
on February 8, 2006) amended section 
2105(g) of the Act to provide for 
continued authority for qualifying States 
to use a portion of their available FY 
2004 and FY 2005 CHIP allotments for 
payments to supplement the Medicaid 
FMAP that result in total Federal 
participation at the EFMAP rate (as 
determined under section 2105(b) of the 
Act) for certain expenditures made 
under the Medicaid program. 
Section 201(b) of the National 
Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006 
and section 201(b) of MMSEA amended 
section 2105(g) of the Act to provide for 
continued authority for such payments 
to qualifying States for FYs 2006 
through 2009. 
Finally, section 107 of CHIPRA 
amended title XXI of the Act to add a 
new paragraph (4) of section 2105(g) of 
the Act; under this new provision, 
qualifying states at their option may use 
up to their entire fiscal year allotments 
for each of fiscal years 2009 through 
2013, to the extent such allotments 
remain available to the State under the 
Act, in an amount equal to the 
additional amount that would have been 
paid to the State if the EFMAP as 
determined under section 2104(b) of the 
Act was substituted for the FMAP 
defined in section 1905(b) of the Act. 
The CHIPRA amendments to the 
qualifying State provision provide that 
the indicated amounts of such 
allotments are available for certain 
expenditures of the qualifying States as 
described in section 2105(g)(4)(B) of the 
Act, as amended by CHIPRA. In 
particular, these are expenditures made 
by such States on or after February 5, 
2009 for children whose family income 
equals or exceeds 133 percent of the 
Federal poverty line but does not exceed 
the Medicaid applicable income level. 
As indicated above, this is a change 
from what was in effect previously; that 
is, before CHIPRA, the income level was 
150 percent of the Federal poverty line. 
II. Provisions of This Proposed Rule 
For the reasons described in section I 
of this preamble, the purpose of this 
proposed rule would: 
• Set forth the methodology and 
procedures for determining the CHIP 
allotments for FY 2009 through FY 2013 
for the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia, and the U.S. Commonwealths 
and Territories as provided under 
section 2104(m) of the Act. 
• Describe the methodology and 
process used to coordinate the funding 
provided previously to States under 
MMSEA, as described in the May 23, 
2008 Federal Register (page 30112, Vol. 
73, No. 101), under the provisions of 
section 2104(a)(11) of the Act related to 
States’ FY 2009 allotments provided to 
States before CHIPRA, section 2104(k) of 
the Act related to the redistribution of 
States’ unexpended FY 2006 allotments 
to address States’ shortfalls in FY 2009, 
and section 2104(l) of the Act related to 
funding States’ shortfalls in FY 2009 for 
their expenditures through March 31, 
2009. 
• Set forth the FY 2009 allotments as 
determined in accordance with such 
methodologies and procedures. 
• Describe the implementation of the 
continued authority under section 
2104(g)(4) of the Act as amended by 
CHIPRA for ‘‘qualifying States’’ to elect 
to receive their available CHIP 
allotments for FY 2009 through FY 2013 
CHIP as increased Federal matching 
funds for certain expenditures in their 
Medicaid programs. 
• Describe the retrospective 
adjustment for the FY 2008 shortfall 
funding as provided under section 
2104(j) of the Act. 
To incorporate the policies and 
implement the statutory provisions as 
described above, we are proposing the 
following revisions: 
• In 42 CFR § 457.600(a), we are 
proposing to remove the date ‘‘2007’’ 
and add in its place ‘‘2013’’ of this 
regulation. 
• In § 457.608, we are proposing to 
revise the heading ‘‘Process and 
calculation of State allotments for a 
fiscal year’’ to read ‘‘Process and 
calculation of State allotments prior to 
FY 2009’’ of this regulation. 
• In part 457 subpart F, we are 
proposing to add § 457.609, ‘‘Process 
and calculation of State allotments for a 
fiscal year after FY 2008’’, which would 
implement the new funding amounts 
available for States’ CHIP allotments for 
FY 2009 through FY 2013. 
• In § 457.610, we are proposing to 
revise the heading ‘‘Period of 
availability for State allotments for a 
fiscal year’’ to read ‘‘Period of 
availability for State allotments prior to 
FY 2009’’ of this regulation. In the first 
line of the paragraph for this section, we 
are also proposing to remove the words 
‘‘for a fiscal year’’ and add in its place 
‘‘prior to FY 2009’’ of this regulation. 
• In part 457 subpart F, we are 
proposing to add § 457.611, ‘‘Period of 
availability for State allotments for a 
fiscal year after FY 2008’’, which would 
reflect the 3 fiscal year and 2 fiscal year 
periods of availability, as applicable to 
fiscal years before FY 2009 and effective 
for FY 2009 and subsequent fiscal years, 
respectively. 
A. Methodology and Procedures for 
Determining the CHIP Allotments for FY 
2009 Through FY 2013 for the 50 States 
and the District of Columbia, and the 
U.S. Commonwealths and Territories 
1. Reauthorization Funding for the CHIP 
Section 101 of CHIPRA provides the 
reauthorization funding for providing 
States’ allotments for FY 2009 through 
FY 2013. In particular, section 101 of 
CHIPRA amended section 2104(a) of the 
Act to revise paragraph (11) for FY 2008, 
and adds new paragraphs (12) through 
(16) to provide appropriations for FY 
2009 through FY 2013, respectively. In 
particular, under the amendments made 
by CHIPRA the appropriated amounts 
available for allotments for these fiscal 
years, respectively are: $10,562,000,000 
for FY 2009 (before CHIPRA the amount 
for FY 2009 was $5,000,000,000); 
$12,520,000,000 for FY 2010; 
$13,459,000,000 for FY 2011; 
$14,982,000,000 for FY 2012, and 
$2,850,000,000 for each of the first and 
second half of FY 2013. Also, section 
108 of CHIPRA provided for a one-time 
appropriation of $11,706,000,000 for 
allotments for the first half of FY 2013. 
Therefore, the total appropriation for 
providing allotments during FY 2013 is 
$17,406,000,000. 
2. Methodology for Determining State’s 
Fiscal Year Allotments 
a. CHIPRA provision of 2009. Section 
102 of CHIPRA adds a new section 
2104(m) of the Act which sets forth the

47521 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 178 / Wednesday, September 16, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
methodology for determining States’ 
CHIP allotments for each of FY 2009 
through FY 2013. In general, the States’ 
fiscal year allotments are provided from 
the appropriation for the respective 
fiscal year allotment, subject to a 
proration adjustment, described in 
section II.A.2.g. of this proposed rule. 
b. FY 2009 Allotments. The FY 2009 
allotments for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealths and Territories, are 
provided from the FY 2009 
appropriation of $10,562,000,000, and 
are subject to a proration adjustment 
described in II.A.2.g. of this proposed 
rule, if necessary. The FY 2009 CHIP 
allotments for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia are determined 
under a different methodology than is 
used for the determining the FY 2009 
allotments for the Commonwealths and 
Territories. 
The FY 2009 allotment for the 50 
States and the District of Columbia is 
determined as 110 percent of the highest 
of the following three amounts: 
• The total Federal payments to the 
State from the States’ available CHIP 
allotments in FY 2008 as reported by the 
State and certified to the Secretary 
through the November 2008 submission 
of the quarterly expenditure reports, 
Forms CMS–21 and CMS–64, multiplied 
by the allotment increase factor 
described in section II. A. 2.h. of this 
proposed rule; 
• The amount allotted to the State for 
FY 2008, multiplied by the allotment 
increase factor described in section 
II.A.2.h. of this proposed rule. 
• The projected total Federal 
payments to the State under title XXI of 
the Act for FY 2009, determined based 
on the February submission of 
projections of expenditures as certified 
by the State to CMS no later than March 
31, 2009. These projections may include 
certain amounts of Medicaid 
expenditures for certain ‘‘qualifying 
states’’ described in section 2105(g) of 
the Act. 
With respect to the last item related 
to projected total Federal payments for 
FY 2009 under title XXI, section 107 of 
CHIPRA added a new paragraph section 
2105(g)(4) of the Act to allow States to 
use up to 100 percent of their FY 2009 
allotments for these expenditures. This 
provision is further described in section 
II.E. of this proposed rule. 
The FY 2009 allotment for the 
Commonwealths and Territories is 
determined as the highest amount of the 
Federal payments made to the 
Commonwealth or Territory under title 
XXI of the Act in any of the fiscal years 
for the period of FY 1999 through FY 
2008, multiplied by the allotment 
increase factor described in section 
II.A.2.h. of this proposed rule, plus an 
additional amount. The additional 
amount is equal to $40,000,000, as 
appropriated under section 
2104(c)(4)(B) of the Act, multiplied by 
the following percentage provided 
under section 2104(c)(2) of the Act for 
the indicated jurisdiction: 91.6 percent 
for Puerto Rico; 3.5 percent for Guam; 
2.6 percent for the Virgin Islands; 1.2 
percent for American Samoa; and 1.1 
percent for the Northern Mariana 
Islands. 
c. FY 2010 Allotments. The FY 2010 
allotments for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealths and Territories, are 
provided from the FY 2010 
appropriation of $12,520,000,000, and 
are subject to a proration adjustment if 
necessary, described in section II.A.2.g. 
of this proposed rule. Under the 
CHIPRA, the FY 2010 allotment for each 
State will be determined by multiplying 
the allotment increase factor for FY 
2010 for the State, by the sum of: The 
State’s FY 2009 allotment; the amount 
of the final FY 2006 redistributed 
allotments paid to the State as 
determined under section 2104(k) of the 
Act, and subject to any final 
retrospective adjustment to such 
amount determined under section 
2104(k)(5) of the Act; the amount of the 
final additional FY 2009 allotments paid 
to the State as determined under section 
2104(l) of the Act, and subject to any 
final retrospective adjustment to such 
amount determined under section 
2104(l)(5) of the Act; and the amount of 
any contingency fund payment made to 
the State for FY 2010, as determined 
under section 2104(n) of the Act. 
For the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia, under section 2104(m)(6) of 
the Act, the FY 2010 allotment may 
include additional amounts in 
situations where such States have 
submitted an expansion allotment 
adjustment request before August 31, 
2009. 
For the Commonwealths and 
Territories, in accounting for the 
amounts of the FY 2009 allotments for 
purposes of determining the FY 2010 
allotments, the component of the FY 
2009 allotment for such jurisdictions 
relating to the additional $40 million 
referenced in section 2104(c)(4) of the 
Act, is not included. This is because 
section 2104(m)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Act, as 
amended by CHIPRA, references the FY 
2009 allotment as determined in section 
2104(m)(1) of the Act; that section in 
turn provides for determining the FY 
2009 allotments from the amounts 
appropriated in section 2104(a)(12) of 
the Act. That is, such section 2104(m)(1) 
of the Act does not include the 
additional $40 million which is 
separately appropriated and available 
only for the jurisdictions in determining 
their FY 2009 allotments. Therefore, the 
component of the jurisdictions’ FY 2009 
allotment related to the additional $40 
million would not be included in 
determining the amount of the 
jurisdictions’ FY 2010 allotments. 
d. FY 2011 Allotments. The FY 2011 
allotments for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealths and Territories, are 
provided from the FY 2011 
appropriation ($13,459,000,000). The 
amounts of these allotments are subject 
to a proration adjustment described in 
section II.A.2.g of this proposed rule, if 
necessary. Section 2104(m)(2)(A)(ii) of 
the CHIPRA amendments refers to a 
‘‘rebasing’’ process for determining the 
FY 2011 allotments; this requirement 
means that the States’ payments rather 
than their allotments for FY 2010 must 
be considered in calculating the FY 
2011 allotments. In particular the FY 
2011 allotments are determined by 
multiplying the increase factor for FY 
2011 by the sum of: Any Federal 
payments made from the States’ 
available allotments in FY 2010; any 
amounts provided as redistributed 
allotments in FY 2010 to the State; and 
any Federal payments attributable to 
any contingency fund payments made to 
the State for FY 2010 determined under 
Section 2104(n) of the Act. 
e. FY 2012 Allotments. The FY 2012 
allotments for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealths and Territories, are 
provided from the FY 2012 
appropriation of $14,982,000,000, and 
are subject to a proration adjustment 
described in II.A.2.g.of this proposed 
rule, if necessary. Under the CHIPRA, 
the FY 2012 allotment for each State 
will be determined by multiplying the 
allotment increase factor for FY 2012 for 
the State, by the sum of: the State’s FY 
2011 allotment and any contingency 
fund payment made to the State for FY 
2011, as determined under section 
2104(n) of the Act. 
For the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia, under section 2104(m)(6) of 
the Act, the FY 2012 allotment may 
include additional amounts in 
situations where such States have 
submitted an expansion allotment 
adjustment request before August 31, 
2011. 
f. FY 2013 Allotments. The FY 2013 
allotments for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealths and Territories, are 
comprised of two components related to 
the first half of FY 2013 (that is, the

period of October 1, 2012 through 
March 31, 2013) and second half of FY 
2013 (that is, April 1, 2012 through 
September 30, 2013). The FY 2013 
allotments for the first and second half 
of FY 2013 are subject to a proration 
adjustment described in section II.A.2.g 
of this proposed rule, as applicable. 
The allotments for the first half of FY 
2013 are provided from a total available 
appropriation of $14,556,000,000, 
comprised of $2,850,000,000 
appropriated under section 
2104(a)(16)(A) of the Act, and 
$11,706,000,000 appropriated under 
section 108 of CHIPRA. The allotments 
for the first half of FY 2013 is equal to 
the ‘‘first half ratio’’ multiplied by: the 
allotment increase factor for FY 2013 
multiplied by the sum of: any Federal 
payments made from the States’ 
available allotments in FY 2012; any 
amounts provided as redistributed 
allotments in FY 2012 to the State; and 
any Federal payments attributable to 
any contingency fund payments made to 
the State for FY 2012 as determined 
under Section 2104(n) of the Act. For 
this purpose, the first half ratio is the 
percentage determined by dividing 
$14,556,000,000 (calculated as the sum 
of $2,850,000,000 (the appropriation for 
the first half of FY 2013) and 
$11,706,000,000 (the one-time 
appropriation for the first half of the FY 
2013)) by $17,406,000,000 (calculated as 
$2,850,000,000, the appropriation for 
the second half of FY 2013) plus the 
$14,556,000,000 amount). 
The allotments for the second half of 
FY 2013 are provided from a total 
available appropriation of 
$2,850,000,000, appropriated under 
section 2104(a)(16)(B) of the Act. The 
allotments for the second half of FY 
2013 is equal to $2,850,000,000 
multiplied by a percentage equal to the 
amount of the allotment for the State for 
the first half of FY 2013 divided by the 
sum of all such first half of FY 2013 
allotments for all States. 
(g) Proration Rule. Under section 
2104(m)(4) of the Act, as amended by 
CHIPRA, if the amount of States’ 
allotments for a fiscal year (as 
determined in accordance with the 
provisions described of this proposed 
rule, or in the case of FY 2013, the 
amount of an allotment for each half of 
the fiscal year) exceeds the total 
appropriations available for such 
periods, the total allotments for each of 
these periods will be reduced on a 
proportional basis. The total amount 
available nationally for the period is 
multiplied by a proration percentage 
determined by dividing the amount 
determined for the period by the sum of 
such amounts. 
h. The allotment increase factor for a 
fiscal year. Under Section 2104(m)(5) of 
the Act, the allotment increase factor for 
a fiscal year is equal to the product of 
two amounts for the fiscal year: the per 
capita health care growth factor and the 
Child Population growth factor. 
For this purpose, in general, the per 
capita health care growth factor for a 
fiscal year is equal to 1 plus the 
percentage increase in the projected per 
capita amount of the National Health 
Expenditures from the calendar year in 
which the previous fiscal year ends to 
the calendar year in which the fiscal 
year involved ends, as most recently 
published by CMS before the beginning 
of the fiscal year involved. 
In general, for the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, the child 
population growth factor for a fiscal 
year is equal to 1 plus the percentage 
increase (if any) in the population of 
children in the State from July 1 in the 
previous fiscal year to July 1 in the 
fiscal year involved, as determined by 
CMS based on the most recent 
published estimates of the Census 
Bureau available before the beginning of 
the fiscal year involved plus 1 
percentage point. In the determination 
of the child population growth factor, 
the CHIP legislation refers to ‘‘the 
percentage increase (if any)’’ of the 
population of children in the State. In 
this regard, child population growth 
factor refers only to increases in the 
population of children. Thus, if there 
was a decrease in the population of 
children over the indicated period, the 
child population growth factor for such 
state would be 0.0 percent plus one 
percentage point; that is, negative 
growth in the children population 
would not result in the growth factor 
being less than 101 percent. 
Because of concerns about availability 
of data to determine the child 
population growth factor for the 
Commonwealths and the Territories, 
section 2104(m)(1)(B) of the Act 
explicitly required that the term 
‘‘United States’’ be substituted for the 
term ‘‘the State’’. For fiscal years after 
FY 2009, that exception does not apply, 
and we will determine the child 
population growth factor for the 
Commonwealths and the Territories, 
based on the most recent published 
estimates of the Census Bureau. In 
accordance with section 602(b) of the 
CHIPRA, which added a new section 
2109(b)(2)(B) of the Act, we will be 
working with the Secretary of the 
Commerce Department on appropriate 
adjustments to improve the Current 
Population Survey (CPS), or develop 
other data, to determine the child 
population growth factor. 
i. CHIP Fiscal Year Allotment Process. 
As described above, the determination 
of the allotments for each fiscal year 
potentially involves the collection of 
relevant data, such as related to the 
allotment increase factor, or the 
consideration of additional information 
later or after the end of the fiscal year; 
for example, the determination of the 
FY 2010 and FY 2012 allotments allows 
States to receive increases in their CHIP 
allotments to reflect the submission of 
certain expansions to their CHIP 
programs. In that regard, we are 
incorporating into the CHIP regulation a 
process, under which the Secretary may 
elect to publish preliminary fiscal year 
allotments. Consequently, under this 
process at the time the updated 
allotment amounts became available the 
Secretary would publish a final notice. 
For example, under the CHIPRA 
legislation, in the determination of the 
FY 2010 and FY 2012 allotments, States 
can amend their CHIP programs to 
provide for expansions; the increase in 
expenditures for such expansions would 
serve to increase the amount of the State 
fiscal year allotments associated with 
the year of such expansions. As 
determined by the Secretary, the CHIP 
allotments for a fiscal year may need to 
be published first as Preliminary 
Allotments and then later as Final 
Allotments in the Federal Register. The 
proposed rule provides for the potential 
for a preliminary and final allotment to 
be determined. 
B. Coordination of CHIP Funding for FY 
2009 
Before the enactment of CHIPRA, 
section 2104(a)(11) of the Act, as 
amended by MMSEA, appropriated $5 
billion for purposes of providing FY 
2009 allotments for States. Under the 
CHIP statute as amended by MMSEA 
and before the enactment of CHIPRA, 
such funds were potentially available 
for allotment and obligation to States for 
their CHIP related expenditures in FY 
2009 through March 31, 2009. 
Furthermore, section 2104(k) of the Act 
and section 2104(l) of the Act, as 
amended by MMSEA, provided for 
redistribution of the unexpended FY 
2006 allotments in FY 2009, and for 
additional FY 2009 shortfall allotments 
in FY 2009, respectively. However, 
section 3(c)(1) of CHIPRA provides for 
a rescission of amounts of these funds 
that were not obligated before April 1, 
2009. Furthermore, section 3(c)(2) of 
CHIPRA requires that the FY 2009 
allotments, as determined under section 
2104(m)(1) of the Act (as amended by 
CHIPRA), be reduced by the following 
amounts that were appropriated and 
obligated before April 1, 2009. Amounts

47523 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 178 / Wednesday, September 16, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
appropriated and obligated before April 
1, 2009 include the amounts of the FY 
2009 allotments appropriated under 
section 2104(a)(11) of the Act, as 
amended by MMSEA and before the 
enactment of CHIPRA; amounts of FY 
2006 redistributed allotments, provided 
under section 2104(k) of the Act; and, 
the amounts of the FY 2009 shortfall 
allotments, provided under section 
2104(l) of the Act. This coordination 
ensures that States’ FY 2009 CHIP 
funding does not exceed the final FY 
2009 CHIP allotments as determined 
under the CHIPRA. 
C. FY 2009 Allotments Determined in 
Accordance With Such Methodologies 
and Procedures 
In accordance with the methodology 
described in section II.A. of this 
proposed rule relating to the calculation 
of the fiscal year CHIP allotments, and 
in section II.B. of this proposed rule 
relating to the coordination of CHIP 
funding, we have calculated the FY 
2009 allotments for the States. That 
calculation is contained in three tables 
described in section III. of this proposed 
rule; Table 1 provides the calculation of 
the allotment increase factor for FY 
2009, Table 2 provides the calculation 
of the FY 2009 allotment, and Table 3 
provides the coordination of funds in 
FY 2009. 
D. Period of Availability for CHIP 
Allotments 
Section 105 of CHIPRA amended 
section 2105(e) of the Act to revise the 
period of availability for expenditure by 
States of their CHIP fiscal year 
allotments. Before the enactment of 
CHIPRA, States’ CHIP fiscal year 
allotments were available for 
expenditure by the State for 3 fiscal 
years, the fiscal year and the subsequent 
2 fiscal years. With the enactment of 
CHIPRA, section 2105(e) of the Act now 
provides that each of the States’ fiscal 
year allotments for FY 1998 through FY 
2008, are available for the expenditure 
by the State for 3 fiscal years. Finally, 
section 2104(e) of the Act as amended 
by CHIPRA now indicates that States’ 
fiscal year allotments for FY 2009 and 
each succeeding fiscal year are available 
for expenditure by the States for 2 fiscal 
years, the current fiscal year and the 
immediately subsequent fiscal year. In 
this proposed rule, we have amended 
the CHIP regulations at § 457.611 to 
reflect the 3 fiscal year and 2 fiscal year 
periods of availability, as applicable to 
fiscal years before FY 2009 and effective 
for FY 2009 and subsequent fiscal years, 
respectively. 
E. Continuing Authority for Qualifying 
States To Use FY 2009 Through FY 2013 
Allotments for Certain Medicaid 
Expenditures 
Section 107 of CHIPRA amended the 
CHIP statute to add a new section 
2105(g)(4) of the Act to allow certain 
‘‘qualifying states’’ described in section 
2105(g) of the Act to elect to use up to 
100 percent of their available CHIP 
fiscal year allotments for FY 2009 and 
following fiscal years for certain 
expenditures in Medicaid. Before the 
enactment of CHIPRA, States were only 
able to use up to 20 percent of their 
available fiscal year CHIP allotments for 
the applicable Medicaid expenditures. 
With the enactment of CHIPRA, 
beginning with the FY 2009 allotment, 
States can use up to 100 percent of their 
FY 2009 and following fiscal year 
allotments for the States’ qualifying 
expenditures. In that case, only the 
Federal share portion of the 
expenditures which is above the amount 
that the State would have received 
under Medicaid would be applied 
against the CHIP allotment. 
Note, under section 5001 of the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 (ARRA, Pub. L. 111–5, 
enacted on February 17, 2009) the 
FMAP under the Medicaid program has 
been increased during the 9-quarter 
period October 1, 2009 through 
December 31, 2010. Because of this 
increase, the amount of the Federal 
share funds that will be applied against 
the CHIP qualifying States’ FY 2009 
(and following) allotments will be 
reduced. For example, a qualifying 
State’s regular Medicaid FMAP rate in 
FY 2009 is 50 percent, its increased 
FMAP under ARRA in Medicaid is 
60.00 percent, and its CHIP EFMAP is 
65.00 percent. This qualifying State 
would be able to claim the ‘‘qualifying’’ 
expenditures in FY 2009 at the 65.00 
percent EFMAP rate in CHIP, and only 
5 percent of such expenditures would 
apply against the State’s FY 2009 
allotment, calculated as 65.00 percent 
(CHIP EFMAP) minus 60.00 percent 
(increased FMAP under ARRA) 
claimable under the Medicaid program. 
In the same example (and assuming the 
same FMAP for Medicaid and enhanced 
FMAP in CHIP), after December 31, 
2010 15.00 percent of the qualifying 
expenditure in FY 2011 would apply 
against the State’s FY 2011 CHIP 
allotment, calculated as 65.00 percent 
(CHIP EFMAP) minus 50.00 percent 
(regular FMAP) claimable under the 
Medicaid program. We have amended 
the CHIP regulations to reflect this 
provision. 
F. Retrospective Adjustment of FY 2008 
Shortfall Allotments 
Section 2104(j)(5) of the Act, as 
amended by MMSEA provides for a 
potential retrospective adjustment with 
respect to the amounts of States’ FY 
2008 shortfall allotments provided to 
them in FY 2008 and based on 
expenditure reports for FY 2008 
submitted and certified by States to 
CMS no later than November 30, 2008. 
Under section 2104(j)(2) and (3)(A) of 
the Act, additional FY 2008 shortfall 
allotments were made available only to 
those 50 States and the District of 
Columbia that were initially determined 
to have a shortfall in CHIP funding in 
FY 2008 based on their FY 2008 
expenditure projections as submitted 
and certified by the States by November 
30, 2007. For those States, under section 
2104(j)(5) of the Act, the retrospective 
adjustment to the amounts of their 
additional FY 2008 shortfall allotments 
is based on the FY 2008 expenditure 
projections submitted and certified by 
such States by November 30, 2008. 
Through the end of FY 2008 and 
based on States’ estimated FY 2008 
CHIP expenditures, we had provided 
approximately $1,201 million in total 
additional FY 2008 shortfall allotments 
to States to address their projected 
shortfalls in FY 2008. However, based 
on the States’ actual FY 2008 
expenditures, as submitted through 
November 30, 2008, the final States’ 
shortfalls in FY 2008 were only 
approximately $995 million. That is, of 
those States who overestimated their 
projected shortfalls, final shortfalls for 
FY 2008 were about $232 million less 
than were previously estimated, and for 
States that underestimated their 
shortfalls, their actual shortfalls were 
about $26 million higher. Thus, the final 
net shortfall for States was about $995 
million ($1,201 million minus $232 
million plus $26 million). Table 4 in 
this notice presents the final FY 2008 
shortfall allotments after applying the 
retrospective adjustment under section 
2104(j)(5) of the Act. 
G. Retrospective Adjustment of FY 2009 
Shortfall Allotments 
Section 2104(l)(5) of the Act, as 
amended by MMSEA provides for a 
potential retrospective adjustment with 
respect to the amounts of States’ FY 
2009 shortfall allotments provided to 
them in FY 2009 prior to April 1, 2009 
based on expenditure reports for the 
first two quarters of FY 2009 as 
submitted and certified by States to 
CMS no later than May 31, 2009. 
Under section 2104(l)(2) and (3)(A) of 
the Act, additional FY 2009 shortfall

allotments were made available to those 
States that were initially determined to 
have a shortfall in CHIP funding in FY 
2009 based on their expenditure 
projections for the first two quarters of 
FY 2009 as submitted and certified by 
the States by November 30, 2008. For 
those States, under section 2104(l)(5) of 
the Act, the retrospective adjustment to 
the amounts of their additional FY 2009 
shortfall allotments is based on the FY 
2009 expenditures for the first two 
quarters of FY 2009 as submitted and 
certified by such States by May 31, 
2009. 
Prior to April 1, 2009, and based on 
States’ estimated FY 2009 CHIP 
expenditures through the end of the 
second quarter of FY 2009, we had 
provided approximately $267 million in 
total additional FY 2009 shortfall 
allotments to States to address their 
projected shortfalls in FY 2009 through 
the end of the second quarter FY 2009 
in that amount. However, based on the 
States’ actual FY 2009 expenditures for 
the first two quarters of FY 2009, as 
submitted through May 31, 2009, the 
final States’ shortfalls in FY 2009 
through the second quarter of FY 2009 
for the shortfall States were only 
approximately $210 million. That is, for 
the shortfall States initially receiving 
the additional FY 2009 shortfall 
allotments, based on their actual FY 
2009 reported expenditures for the first 
two quarters of FY 2009, their final 
shortfalls for the first two quarters of FY 
2009 were about $58 million less than 
was previously estimated. Table 5 in 
this notice presents the final FY 2009 
shortfall allotments after applying the 
retrospective adjustment under section 
2104(l)(5) of the Act. Also, Column D in 
Table 3 reflects these final retrospective 
adjustment FY 2009 shortfall 
allotments.

D. Table 4—Retrospective Adjustment 
for the FY 2008 Shortfall Allotments 
Table 4 contains the final 
retrospective adjustment determination 
with respect to the amounts of the 
additional shortfall allotments provided 
to States to eliminate their CHIP funding 
shortfalls in FY 2008, in accordance 
with the provisions of section 2104(j)(5) 
of the Act. Under section 2104(j)(2) and 
(3)(A) of the Act, additional FY 2008 
shortfall allotments were made available 
only to those 50 States and the District 
of Columbia that were determined to 
have a shortfall in CHIP funding in FY 
2008 based on their FY 2008 
expenditure projections as submitted 
and certified by the States by November 
30, 2007. For those States, under section 
2104(j)(5) of the Act, the retrospective 
adjustment to the amounts of their 
additional FY 2008 shortfall allotments 
is based on the FY 2008 expenditure 
projections submitted and certified by 
such States by November 30, 2008. 
Key to Table 4 
Column/Description 
Column A = State. Column A contains 
the name of the State. 
Column B = FY 2008 Actual 
Expenditures 11/30/08. Column B 
contains the total Federal share amount 
of the CHIP expenditures reported by 
the States for FY 2008, as contained on 
the States’ expenditure reports 
submitted and certified by the States by 
November 30, 2008. 
Column C = FY 2006 Carryover 
Allotments into FY 08. Column C 
contains the amounts of the States’ 
unused FY 2006 allotments remaining at 
the end of FY 2007, if any, and carried 
over into FY 2008. 
Column D = FY 2007 Carryover 
Allotments into FY 08. Column D 
contains the amounts of the States’ 
unused FY 2007 allotments remaining at 
the end of FY 2007, if any, and carried 
over into FY 2008. 
Column E = FY 2008 Allotments. 
Column E contains the amounts of the 
States’ FY 2008 allotments, as published 
in the May 23, 2008 Federal Register 
(30112, Vol. 73, No. 101). 
Column F = FY 2005 Redistribution 
Based on November 30, 2007 Estimates. 
Column F contains the amounts of the 
FY 2005 redistributed allotments issued 
to the State in FY 2008, if any, as based 
on the States’ estimates of CHIP funding 
needed for FY 2008 submitted and 
certified by the State by November 30, 
2007. 
Column G = Total Avail. Allotments 
in FY 2008. Column G contains the total 
amount of CHIP funds available to the 
State in FY 2008 without consideration 
of the issuance of any additional FY 
2008 shortfall allotments, determined as 
the sum of the amounts, if any, in 
Columns C, D, E, and F. 
Column H = Retro. Adjusted Shortfall 
in FY 2008. Column H contains the 
retrospective adjustment amount of 
States’ shortfall in CHIP funding for FY 
2008. This amount is based on the 
States’ actual FY 2008 CHIP 
expenditures as submitted and certified 
by the State by November 30, 2008 and 
the actually available CHIP funds 
without any additional FY 2008 
shortfall allotments. The retrospective 
adjustment is applicable only for States 
that were determined to have a shortfall 
in CHIP funding in FY 2008 based on 
their FY 2008 expenditure projections 
submitted and certified by November 
30, 2007; such States are those with an 
FY 2008 shortfall amount shown in 
Column I. For such States, the amount 
of the retrospective adjustment shortfall 
amount in Column H is calculated as 
the difference between the amounts of 
the States’ projected Federal share CHIP 
expenditures for FY 2008 in Column B 
and the amounts of the States’ available 
allotments funds in FY 2008 Column G. 
Column I = Total FY 2008 SF 
Allotment Grants Issued in FY 2008. 
Column I contains the total amounts of 
the additional FY 2008 shortfall 
allotments actually issued to the State in 
FY 2008 to address States’ CHIP funding 
shortfalls in FY 2008. 
Column J = FY 2008 Excess SF 
Allotments Provided In FY 2008. 
Column J contains the amounts of the 
States’ excess additional FY 2008 
shortfall allotments provided in FY 
2008, as determined under the 
retrospective adjustment provision. For 
States that received additional FY 2008 
shortfall allotments, the amounts in 
Column J represent the amount of the 
FY 2008 shortfall allotments provided 
in FY 2008 that were greater than were 
needed to address such States’ CHIP 
funding shortfalls in FY 2008. The 
amounts in Column J are calculated as 
the difference between the actual 
additional FY 2008 shortfall allotments 
in Column I and the amounts of the 
States’ retrospectively adjusted FY 2008 
shortfall in Column H. 
Column K = Additional FY 2008 SF 
Allotments Needed for FY 2008. 
Column K contains the amounts of the 
additional FY 2008 shortfall allotments 
needed by FY 2008 shortfall States as 
determined under the retrospective 
adjustment provision. For States that 
received such shortfall allotments in FY 
2008, the amounts in Column K 
represent the amount of the additional 
FY 2008 shortfall allotments needed in 
FY 2008 that were greater than were 
provided to address such States’ CHIP 
funding shortfalls in FY 2008. The 
amounts in Column K are calculated as 
the difference between the amounts of 
the States’ retrospectively adjusted FY 
2008 shortfall in Column H and the

E. Table 5—Retrospective Adjustment 
for the FY 2009 Shortfall Funding 
Table 5 contains the final 
retrospective adjustment determination 
with respect to the amounts of the 
additional shortfall allotments provided 
to States to eliminate their CHIP funding 
shortfalls for the first two quarters of FY 
2009, in accordance with the provisions 
of section 2104(l)(5) of the Act. Under 
section 2104(l)(2) and (3)(A) of the Act, 
additional FY 2009 shortfall allotments 
were initially made available only to 
those States that were projected to have 
a shortfall in CHIP funding for the first 
two quarters of FY 2009 based on their 
FY 2009 expenditure projections as 
submitted and certified by the States by 
November 30, 2008. For those States, 
under section 2104(l)(5) of the Act, the 
retrospective adjustment to the amounts 
of their additional FY 2009 shortfall 
allotments are based on the FY 2009 
expenditures for the first two quarters of 
FY 2009 as submitted and certified by 
such States by May 31, 2009. 
Key to Table 5 
Column/Description 
Column A = State. Column A contains 
the name of the State. 
Column B = FY 09 Actual Expends. 
Thru 3/31/09 Reported By 5/31/09. 
Column B contains the total Federal 
share amount of the CHIP expenditures 
reported by the States for the first two 
quarters of FY 2009 (the period ending 
March 31, 2009), as contained on the 
States’ expenditure reports submitted 
and certified by the States by May 31, 
2009. 
Column C = FY 07 Carryover 
Allotments into FY 09. Column C 
contains the amounts of the States’ 
unused FY 2007 allotments remaining at 
the end of FY 2008, if any, and carried 
over into FY 2009. 
Column D = FY 08 Carryover 
Allotments into FY 09. Column D 
contains the amounts of the States’ 
unused FY 2008 allotments remaining at 
the end of FY 2008, if any, and carried 
over into FY 2009. 
Column E = FY 09 Pre-CHIPRA Allot. 
Grants. Column E contains the amounts 
of the States’ FY 2009 allotment grants 
as issued to States prior to April 1, 2009 
from the FY 2009 allotments as 
determined under the CHIP statute in 
effect prior to the enactment of CHIPRA, 
as published in the May 23, 2008 
Federal Register (30112, Vol. 73, No. 
101). 
Column F = FY 2006 Redistribution 
Based on 11/30/08 Estimates. Column F 
contains the amounts of the FY 2006 
redistributed allotments issued to the 
State in FY 2009, if any, as based on the 
States’ estimates of CHIP funding 
needed for FY 2009 submitted and 
certified by the State by November 30, 
2008. 
Column G = Total Avail. Allotments 
in FY 2009. Column G contains the total 
amount of CHIP funds available to the 
State in FY 2009 without consideration 
of the issuance of any additional FY 
2009 shortfall allotments, determined as 
the sum of the amounts, if any, in 
Columns C, D, E, and F. 
Column H = Retro. Adjusted Shortfall 
FY 2009 Thru 3/31/09. Column H 
contains the retrospective adjustment 
amount of States’ shortfalls in CHIP 
funding through the end of March 31, 
2009, based on the States’ actual FY 
2009 CHIP expenditures for the first two 
quarters of FY 2009 as submitted and 
certified by the State by May 31, 2009 
and the actually available CHIP funds 
not including any additional FY 2009 
shortfall allotments. The amount of the 
retrospective adjustment shortfall 
amount in Column H is calculated as 
the difference between the amounts of 
the States’ projected Federal share CHIP 
expenditures for the first two quarters of 
FY 2009 in Column B and the amounts 
of the States’ available allotments funds 
in FY 2009 Column G. 
Column I = Total FY 2009 SF 
Allotments Issued in FY 2009. Column 
I contains the total amounts of the 
additional FY 2009 shortfall allotments 
actually issued to the State in the first 
two quarters of FY 2009 prior to April 
1, 2009 to address States’ CHIP funding 
shortfalls for the first two quarters of FY 
2009. 
Column J = FY 2009 Excess SF 
Allotments Provided In FY 2009. 
Column J contains the amounts of the 
States’ excess additional FY 2009 
shortfall allotments provided in FY 
2009, as determined under the 
retrospective adjustment provision. For 
States that received additional FY 2009 
shortfall allotments, the amounts in 
Column J represent the amount of the 
FY 2009 shortfall allotments provided 
in FY 2009 that were greater than were 
needed to address such States’ CHIP 
funding shortfalls in FY 2009. The 
amounts in Column J are calculated as 
the difference between the actual 
additional FY 2009 shortfall allotments 
in Column I and the amounts of the 
States’ retrospectively adjusted FY 2009 
shortfall in Column H.

IV. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments we normally receive on 
Federal Register documents, we are not 
able to acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the DATES section of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document. 
V. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
This document does not impose any 
information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements. 
Consequently, it need not be reviewed 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget under the authority of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 35). 
VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
We have examined the impacts of this 
rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 on Regulatory Planning and 
Review (September 30, 1993), the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 96–354), 
section 1102(b) of the Social Security 
Act, section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), Executive Order 13132 on 
Federalism (August 4, 1999), and the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 
804(2)). 
Executive Order 12866 directs 
agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety effects, distributive impacts, 
and equity). A regulatory impact 
analysis (RIA) must be prepared for 
major rules with economically 
significant effects ($100 million or more 
in any 1 year). We have determined that 
this proposed rule is economically 
significant, since it provides the 
methodologies under which State 
allotments for FY 2009 through FY 2013 
were calculated and will be in the 
future. In particular, this rule 
implements the CHIP statute as 
amended by CHIPRA, under which 
approximately up to $44 billion in 
additional Federal funds may be made 
available for fiscal years FY 2009 
through FY 2013 in addition to the 
amount of funds previously 
appropriated for States’ CHIPs in 
accordance with the methodology 
established in the CHIP statute. This 
proposed rule also includes the actual 
State fiscal year CHIP allotments for FY 
2009 determined in accordance with the 
methodology set out in this proposed 
rule. The methodologies for determining 
the States’ CHIP allotments was 
established in accordance with the 
methodologies specified in statute and 
does not put forward any discretionary 
administrative policies for determining 
such allotments. Therefore, we have 
determined that there are no policy 
options that require an analysis beyond 
that which is presented in section II of 
this proposed rule. 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
businesses, if a rule has a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. For purposes 
of the RFA, small entities include small 
businesses, nonprofit organizations, and 
small governmental jurisdictions. Most 
hospitals and most other providers and 
suppliers are small entities, either by 
nonprofit status or by having revenues 
of less than $7 million to $34.5 million 
in any 1 year. Individuals and States are 
not included in the definition of a small 
entity. We are not preparing an analysis 
for the RFA because we have 
determined that this proposed rule 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires us to prepare a regulatory 
impact analysis if a rule may have a 
significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to 
the provisions of section 603 of the 
RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of 
the Act, we define a small rural hospital 
as a hospital that is located outside of 
a Core-Based Statistical Area and has 
fewer than 100 beds. We are not 
preparing an analysis for section 1102(b) 
of the Act because we have determined 
that this proposed rule would not have 
a significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. 
Section 202 of the UMRA also 
requires that agencies assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule whose mandates require spending 
in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995 
dollars, updated annually for inflation. 
That threshold level is currently 
approximately $133 million. This 
proposed rule would not create an 
unfunded mandate on States, tribal, or 
local governments in the aggregate, or 
by the private sector in the amount of 
$133 million in any one year. Therefore, 
we are not required to perform an 
assessment of the costs and benefits of 
this rule. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it publishes a proposed 
rule (and subsequent final rule) that 
imposes substantial direct requirement 
costs on State and local governments, 
preempts State law, or otherwise has 
Federalism implications. We have 
determined that this proposed rule 
would not significantly affect States’ 
rights, roles, and responsibilities. 
Low-income children would benefit 
from payments under this program 
through increased opportunities for 
health insurance coverage. We believe 
this proposed rule would have an 
overall positive impact by informing 
States, the District of Columbia, and 
Commonwealths and Territories of the 
extent to which they are permitted to 
expend funds under their child health 
plans using the additional funds 
provided by the FY 2009 allotment 
amounts. 
Accounting Statement: As required by 
OMB Circular A–4 (available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a-4.pdf), in Table 6, we have 
prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the 
provisions of this rule. This table 
provides our best impact estimate of the 
rule, as it implements the CHIP statute 
as amended by CHIPRA, under which 
approximately up to $44 billion in 
additional Federal funds may be made 
available for fiscal years FY 2009 
through FY 2013, in addition to the 
amount of funds previously 
appropriated for States’ CHIPs. All 
expenditures are classified as transfers 
from the Federal Government to States.

for FY 2012 as determined under 
paragraph (f) of this section. 
(5) Determination of a State Allotment 
for FY 2013. 
(i) General. There are two State 
allotments for FY 2013; one for the 
period beginning October 1, 2012 and 
ending March 31, 2013 and the second 
beginning April 1, 2013 and ending 
September 30, 2013. These State 
allotments are determined for each of 
the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia, and the Commonwealths and 
Territories. 
(ii) The State allotment for FY 2013 
for the period October 1, 2012 and 
ending March 31, 2013 is determined as 
the product of the following: 
(A) The first half ratio determined as 
the amount in paragraph (d)(5)(A)(1) of 
this section divided by the amount in

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife 
and Plants; 12-Month Finding on a 
Petition to Remove the Bliss Rapids 
Snail (Taylorconcha serpenticola) 
From the List of Endangered and 
Threatened Wildlife 
AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, 
Interior. 
ACTION: Notice of 12-month petition 
finding. 
SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (Service), announce a 
12-month finding on a petition to 
remove the Bliss Rapids snail 
(Taylorconcha serpenticola) from the 
Federal List of Endangered and 
Threatened Wildlife (List) pursuant to 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). 
Based on a thorough review of the best 
scientific and commercial data 
available, the species continues to be 
restricted to a small geographic area in 
the middle-Snake River, Idaho, where it 
is dependent upon cool-water spring 
outflows. Although some threats 
identified at the time of listing in 1992 
no longer exist or have been moderated, 
ground water depletion and impaired 
water quality still threaten the Bliss 
Rapids snail. In addition, there are 
significant uncertainties about the 
effects of hydropower operations and 
New Zealand mudsnails on the
