<title>Justification Analysis This Part analyzes the cost justification of the proposed standards. First, we conduct a breakeven analysis to demonstrate that the costs of PREA compliance are justified by the anticipated benefits. Given that the proposed PREA standards are expected to cost the correctional community approximately $213 million in startup costs, and that the monetary benefit of a 1% reduction in the 62/ Comments of the Institute for Policy Integrity,</title>
