<rawString>DOE modeled this policy by applying a 4-percent increase in the replacement 57799 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 215 / Monday, November 9, 2009 / Proposed Rules governments. On March 18, 1997, DOE published a statement of policy on its process for intergovernmental consultation under UMRA (62 FR 12820) (also available at http:// www.gc.doe.gov). Although today’s supplemental notice does not contain a Federal intergovernmental mandate, it may impose expenditures of $100 million or more on the private sector, although DOE believes such expenditures are likely to be less than $50 million.</rawString>

<rawString>Section 202 of UMRA authorizes an agency to respond to the content requirements of UMRA in any other statement or analysis that accompanies the supplemental notice. 2 U.S.C. 1532(c). The content requirements of section 202(b) of UMRA relevant to a private sector mandate substantially overlap the economic analysis requirements that apply under section 325(o) of EPCA and Executive Order 12866. The Supplementary Information section of this supplemental notice and the ‘‘Regulatory Impact Analysis’’ Act, 1999 DOE determined that, for this rulemaking, it need not prepare a Family Policymaking Assessment under section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999 (Pub. L. 105–277). Id. DOE received no comments concerning section 654 in response to the October 2008 NOPR, and, therefore, takes no further action in today’s supplemental notice with respect to this provision.</rawString>

For the October 2008 NOPR, DOE determined Department of Energy, Resource Room of the Building Technologies Program, 950 L’Enfant Plaza, SW., Suite 600, Washington, DC, 20024, (202) 586–2945, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
