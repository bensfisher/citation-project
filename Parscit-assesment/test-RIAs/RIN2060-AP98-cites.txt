The mechanisms of susceptibility to ozone within the leaves of seedlings and mature trees are identical, and the decreases predicted using the seedlings should be related to the decrease in overall plant fitness for mature trees, but the magnitude of the effect may be higher or lower depending on the tree species (Chappelka and Samuelson, 1998). In areas where certain ozone-sensitive species dominate the forest community, the biomass loss from ozone can be significant. Significant biomass loss can be defined as a more than 2% annual biomass loss, which would cause long term ecological harm as S4-14 the short-term negative effects on seedlings compound to affect long-term forest health (Heck, 1997).

However, we have incorporated a limited, qualitative assessment in this analysis, including indicating which counties would have an additional burden to meet a secondary standard beyond the primary standard, and the qualitative benefits of reducing ozone exposure on forests, crops, and urban ornamentals. S4.4 Benefits of Reducing Ozone Effects on Vegetation and Ecosystems1 Ozone causes discernible injury to a wide array of vegetation (U.S. EPA, 2006; Fox and Mickler, 1996). In terms of forest productivity and ecosystem diversity, ozone may be the pollutant with the greatest potential for regional-scale forest impacts (U.S. EPA, 2006). Studies have demonstrated repeatedly that ozone concentrations commonly observed in polluted areas can have substantial impacts on plant function (De Steiguer et al., 1990; Pye, 1988). When ozone is present in the air, it can enter the leaves of plants, where it can cause significant cellular damage. Like carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gaseous substances, ozone enters plant tissues primarily through the stomata in leaves in a proc</context>

This ozone damage may or may not be accompanied by visible injury on leaves, and likewise, visible foliar injury may or may not be a symptom of the other types of plant damage described above. Foliar injury is usually the first visible sign of injury to plants from ozone exposure and indicates impaired physiological processes in the leaves (Grulke, 2003). When visible injury is present, it is commonly manifested as chlorotic or necrotic spots, and/or increased leaf senescence (accelerated leaf aging). Because ozone damage can consist of visible injury to leaves, it can also reduce the aesthetic value of ornamental vegetation and trees in urban landscapes, and negatively affects scenic vistas in protected natural areas. Ozone can produce both acute and chronic injury in sensitive species depending on the concentration level and the duration of the exposure. Ozone effects also tend to accumulate over the growing season of the plant, so that eve</context>

A separate analysis of the costs and benefits of simulated attainment with 0.060 ppm and 0.055 ppm may be found in Section 2 of this Supplement. All benefits estimates in this analysis are incremental to the 1997 Ozone NAAQS standard at 0.08 ppm and the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS standard at 15/35 µg/m3.

This change results in a larger estimate of PM‐related premature mortality as compared to the 2008 analysis. 2) We now present the summary of the PM2.5 co‐benefits results using concentration‐response functions for mortality from two cohort studies (Pope et al. (2002) and Laden et al. (2006)) instead of range between the minimum and maximum results from an expert elicitation of the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and premature mortality (Roman et al., 2008). This change produces a slightly narrower range of PM‐related mortality estimates as compared to the 2008 analysis. In addition, we provide the full suite of results based on the expert elicitation in the body of the benefits results chapter. 3) When adjusting the benefits of the modeled PM co‐benefits for alternate standard levels, we apply PM2.5 benefit per ton estimates calculated using a broader geographic area, whi</context>

The results shown are not the direct results from the studies or expert elicitation; rather, the estimates are based in part on the concentration‐response function provided in those studies. PM co‐benefit results using a 7% discount rate would be similar, but approximately 9% lower. In 2008, the National Research Council (NRC) evaluated the EPA’s approach to estimating ozone‐related mortality benefits. Among other recommendation, in its report the NRC indicated that “EPA should consider placing greater emphasis on reporting decrease in age‐specific death rates and increases in life expectanc</context>

This change should produce more reliable estimates of PM‐related health impacts. In this analysis we estimate ozone‐related premature mortality using risk coefficients drawn from short‐term mortality studies. Two recent epidemiologic studies assessed the relationship between long‐term exposure to ozone and premature mortality. Jerrett et al. (2009) utilized the ACS cohort with air quality data from 1977 through 2000 (April through September). Jarrett et al. reported a positive and statistically significant association between ambient ozone concentration and respiratory causes of death after controlling for PM2.5 using 4 For more information regarding thresholds in the PM2.5 mortality relationship, please consult the proposed Portland Cement NESHAP RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009a).
