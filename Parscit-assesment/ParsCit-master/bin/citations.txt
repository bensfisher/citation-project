The amendments will apply only to those new systems manufactured after the effective date, therefore affecting the 4,200 new fluoroscopic systems installed annually and a small fraction of current models of radiographic systems that do not meet the standard for x-ray beam quality. 77 In modeling the x-ray equipment market in the United States for the purpose of developing estimates of the cost of these amendments, FDA estimates that there are approximately a total of 40 manufacturers of diagnostic x-ray systems in the United States and half of these (20) market fluoroscopic systems and radiographic systems. It is assumed that manufacturers of radiographic systems typically market 20 models of radiographic systems, while manufacturers of fluoroscopic systems market 10 different models of fluoroscopic systems. These estimates were developed by FDA in 2000. These estimates have not been updated since publication of the proposed rule as the size of the radiographic and fluoroscopic x-ray equipment is not expected to have changed significantly in the period since 2000 and in view of the uncertainty in the original estimates. F. The Amendments The </context>

The cost analysis therefore is limited to those parties who would be directly affected by the adoption of the amendments, namely, manufacturers and FDA itself. In the proposed rule, FDA requested information on the costs that would be imposed by these new requirements that would aid in refining the cost estimates. FDA received no comments or additional information on these costs. 1. Costs Associated With Requirements Affecting Equipment Design The agency estimates that approximately one-half (20) of the manufacturers of x-ray systems will have to make design and manufacturing 92 changes to comply with the revised beam quality requirements. It is estimated that a total of 200 x-ray models will be affected, with a one-time cost of at most $20,000 per model. These numbers result in an estimated first year expenditure of $4.0 million to redesign systems to meet the new beam quality requirement. It will be necessary for manufacturers of fluoroscopic systems equipped with x-ray tubes with high heat capacity to redesign some systems to provide a means to add additional beam filtration.
