Hi Behrang,

I've fixed the bug that you reported. It's caused by the post-processing
module in Parscit, which removes the proper punctuation in XML entities like
&amp; (the ; is removed). The XML output becomes invalid.

If you're getting the source code from github at git://
github.com/knmnyn/ParsCit.git, then you just need to pull the new version
because the change has already been pushed into this repository.

Regards,
Huy
