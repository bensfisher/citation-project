the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act Public Law No 104121 provides that EPA used Velocity Suite‘s Ventyx data as a basis for identifying plant ownership and compiling the list of potentially affected small entities 1 Operating and capital costs Using the IPM parsed outputs for the base case and the proposed Toxics Rule policy case EPA identified units that installed one or more pollution control technologies under the proposed rule The equations for calculating operating and capital costs were adopted from technology assumptions used in EPA‘s version of IPM version 410 The model calculates the capital cost in MW the fixed operation and maintenance OM cost in MWyear and the variable OM cost in MWh	14 Description of Significant Alternatives As required by RFA section 609b as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act SBREFA EPA conducted outreach to small entities and convened a Small Business Advocacy Review SBAR Panel composed of EPA the Small Business Administration SBA and the Office of Management and Budget OMB to obtain the advice and recommendations of small entity representatives SERs that potentially would be subject to the requirements of the proposed Toxics Rule The outreach consisted of meeting with some organizations that represent and include small entities in their membership including the American Public Power
