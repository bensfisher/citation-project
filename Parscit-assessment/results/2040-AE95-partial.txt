are expected to incur another 32 million per year to implement this option for both Electric Generators and Manufacturers resulting in a total annual cost of approximately 127 million for State and local governments The maximum compliance cost for governmentowned Electric Generators in any one year under Option 4 is 176 million in 2033 The maximum administrative cost to NPDES authorities in any
