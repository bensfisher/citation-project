The benefit values presented in this table are the estimated ‚Äúmean‚Äù values. Additional ‚Äúlow‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù value estimates are presented in Chapter 11 of the EEBA. b. Total Social Costs include compliance costs to facilities and government administrative costs.	a. Options are presented in order of increasing stringency. b. Net benefits are calculated by subtracting total annualized costs from total annual benefits. c. Incremental net benefits are equal to the difference between net benefits of an option and net benefits of the previous, less stringent option.	Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13: Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option	Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13: Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option 13-2	Source: U.S. EPA analysis, 2010 13.2 Total Social Costs and Benefits Table 13-4 reports total social costs for Option 4 discounted at 3 and 7 percent rates. At a 3 percent discount rate, total annual social costs are $326.55 million; at a 7 percent discount rate, these costs are $383.10 million.	Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13: Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option 13-4	Table 13-5 presents EPA‚Äôs estimates of benefits and social costs for Option 4 for existing facilities, at 3 percent a. The benefit values presented in this table are the estimated ‚Äúmean‚Äù values. Additional ‚Äúlow‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù value estimates are presented	Table 13-6 provides additional detail on net benefits; this Table compiles the time profiles of benefits and social costs for Option 4. Table 13-6 also reports the discounted present value and annualized value of benefits and costs Source: U.S. EPA Analysis,	13.3.3 Analysis Impact on Small Governments As presented in Table 13-9, costs are lower for small governments in comparison to large governments in the aggregate, and approximately the same on a per facility basis. Under Option 1, the 10 facilities owned by small 224 Maximum per facility values are reported on an unweighted basis.	13.3.4 Analysis Summary Table 13-10 presents a summary of compliance costs under Option 4 for publicly- and privately-owned facilities, along with government administrative costs, for each regulatory option.	For Option 4, EPA estimates total annual compliance costs for government-owned Electric Generators at $9.5 million. NPDES permitting authorities are expected to incur another $3.2 million per year to implement this option for both Electric Generators and Manufacturers, resulting in a total annual cost of approximately $12.7 million for State and local governments. The maximum compliance cost for government-owned Electric Generators in any one year under Option 4 is $17.6 million in 2033. The maximum administrative cost to NPDES authorities in any single year for administering this option is $4.0	13.4 Cost and Economic Impact Analysis ‚Äì Manufacturers a. EPA was unable to determine revenues for 9 parent entities.	13.5 Cost and Economic Impact Analysis ‚Äì Electric Generators 13.5.1 Cost-to-Revenue Analysis: Facility-Level Screening Analysis Table 13-13 reports facility-level cost-to-revenue results for Option 4 by North American Reliability Corporation (NERC) region.226 EPA estimates that 488 Electric Generators facilities subject to the Proposed Existing Facilities Rule will on incur annualized costs of less than 1 percent of revenue under	226 NERC is responsible for the overall reliability, planning, and coordination of the power grids; it is organized into regional councils that are responsible for the overall coordination of bulk power policies that affect their regions‚Äô reliability and quality of service (see Chapter 2.H: Profile of the Electric Power Industry). As noted previously, NERC region definitions have recently changed.	No explicitly analyzed facilities are located in the ASCC region. For more information on explicitly and implicitly analyzed facilities see Appendix 3.A: Use of Sample Weights in the Proposed Existing Facilities Rule Analyses Source: U.S. EPA Analysis,	DOE 2007c Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 13: Cost and Economic Impact of Additional Option	13.6 Assessing the Potential Impact of the Proposed Existing Facilities Rule on Small Entities ‚Äì Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) Analysis 13.6.1 Analysis of Manufacturers As reported in Table 13-18, for Option 4, EPA estimated that no small entities within the Primary Manufacturing Industries or entities owning facilities in Other Industries would receive costs exceeding 1 or 3 percent of revenue, under either of the sample-weighting approaches used for this analysis. Thus, this option would have no material impact on small Manufacturers entities.	SBA,	13.6.3 Overall Small Entity Impact Assessment for Option 4 Abt Associates.
