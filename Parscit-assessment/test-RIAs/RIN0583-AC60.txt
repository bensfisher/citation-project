Section I 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
Supplemental Proposed Rule: On 
January 18, 2001, FSIS published a 
proposed rule in the Federal Register 
entitled, ‘‘Nutrition Labeling of Ground 
or Chopped Meat and Poultry Products 
and Single-Ingredient Products’’ (66 FR 
4969). Because of the length of time 
since the publication of the proposed 
rule, FSIS is providing the public an 
opportunity to comment on this 
supplemental proposed rule. FSIS also 
welcomes comments on relevant issues 
for which there is new evidence since 
the proposed rule was issued. 
This supplemental proposed rule 
responds to all comments received on 
the January 18, 2001 proposed rule and 
explains how the Agency intends to 
proceed with a final rule. Although FSIS 
has come to tentative conclusions 
regarding the issues raised by the 
commenters, in this supplemental 
proposed rule, FSIS is requesting 
additional comments on policies for 
which there were significant differences 
of opinion among commenters. 
Specifically, under the ‘‘Provisions of 
the Supplemental Proposed Rule’’ 
heading below, FSIS is requesting 
comments on whether nutrition 
information should be allowed on point- 
of-purchase materials for ground or 
chopped products, as an alternative to 
requiring nutrition information on the 
product labels. FSIS is also requesting 
comments on the use of statements of 
lean percentages on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
that do not meet the regulatory criteria 
for ‘‘low fat.’’ In addition, under the 
‘‘Provisions of the Supplemental 
Proposed Rule’’ heading below, FSIS is 
requesting comments on whether it 
should provide an exemption from 
nutrition labeling requirements for 
small businesses that include a fat 
percentage statement and lean 
percentage statement on the labeling or 
in labeling of ground or chopped 
product. FSIS is requesting copies of 
any studies, surveys, or other data on 
consumers’ perception of and use of 
point-of-purchase materials versus 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
product and on consumers’ 
understanding of the nutrient content of 
ground or chopped products. FSIS is 
also requesting copies of any studies, 
surveys, or data on consumers’ use and 
understanding of fat percentage and 
lean percentage statements on ground or 
chopped products. FSIS will post on its 
Web site, with this supplemental 
proposed rule, all studies and data 
submitted to the Agency in response to 
this request. FSIS requests comment on 
the potential effects of disallowing a 
statement of lean percentage on ground 
or chopped products. 
FSIS will consider all comments 
received in response to this 
supplemental proposed rule. After 
evaluating the comments, FSIS intends 
to respond to them, make any 
appropriate and necessary changes to 
this rule, and issue the final rule in the 
Federal Register. 
The Proposed Rule 
Major cuts: FSIS proposed to require 
nutrition labeling of the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products identified in §§ 317.344 and 
381.444 that are not ground or chopped, 
except for certain exemptions. FSIS 
proposed that ‘‘ground beef regular 
without added seasonings,’’ ‘‘ground 
beef about 17% fat,’’ and ‘‘ground pork’’ 
would no longer be included in the list 
of major cuts in § 317.344. 
FSIS proposed to make the guidelines 
in place for the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program mandatory for the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products that are not ground or 
chopped. Thus, for these products, FSIS 
proposed that nutrition information be 
provided on the label or at point-of- 
purchase, unless an exemption would 
apply. For further explanation of the 
guidelines for voluntary nutrition 
labeling, see 66 FR 4971, January 18, 
2001. For further explanation of the 
proposal to make these guidelines 
mandatory for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products that are not 
ground or chopped, see 66 FR 4973– 
4975, January 18, 2001. 
In the preamble to the proposed rule, 
FSIS explained that, in its two most 
recent surveys of the voluntary nutrition 
labeling of single-ingredient, raw 
products, FSIS found that significant 
participation in the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program did not exist (66 FR 
4972, January 18, 2001). FSIS 
regulations provide that a food retailer 
is participating at a significant level (1) 
if the retailer provides nutrition labeling 
information for at least 90 percent of the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products it sells; and

(2) if the nutrition label on these 
products is consistent in content and 
format with the mandatory program, or 
if nutrition information is displayed at 
point-of-purchase in an appropriate 
manner. The required nutrition labeling 
provisions for multi-ingredient and heat 
processed products are referred to as 
‘‘the mandatory program.’’ The 
regulations also provide that significant 
participation by food retailers exists if at 
least 60 percent of all companies that 
are evaluated are participating in 
accordance with the guidelines 
(§ 317.343 and § 381.443). The term 
‘‘companies,’’ as used in these 
regulations, refers to individual stores. 
FSIS used a representative sample of 
stores to assess participation (see 58 FR 
640, January 6, 1993). Based on the 
survey data from the two most recent 
surveys, less than 60 percent of stores 
evaluated were participating in 
accordance with the guidelines. 
In the preamble to the proposed rule, 
FSIS explained that, because the most 
recent surveys showed that significant 
participation in the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program did not exist, FSIS 
believed that the proposed rule was 
necessary. FSIS stated that, without 
nutrition information, consumers are 
not able to assess the nutrient content of 
the major cuts and thus cannot make 
educated choices about these products 
based on nutrition information. FSIS 
believed that the lack of nutrition 
information on the labeling of the major 
cuts was misleading (66 FR 4973–4974, 
January 18, 2001) because it fails to 
disclose material facts about the 
consequences of consumption of these 
products. Consumers can compare the 
fat content in major cuts of poultry 
based on whether the product has skin 
and based on the levels of attached fat 
in the product. Similarly, consumers 
can compare the fat content among 
major cuts of meat products based on 
internal marbling and attached fat. 
However, without nutrition labeling for 
the major cuts, consumers cannot assess 
precise levels of fat (e.g., 10 grams vs. 
20 grams of fat per serving) and cannot 
know the levels of specific nutrients, 
such as saturated fat, in these products. 
Therefore, without nutrition labeling of 
these products, consumers cannot make 
educated choices about consuming the 
major cuts. 
The FMIA and PPIA provide that 
product is misbranded if its labeling is 
false or misleading in any particular (21 
U.S.C. 601(n)(1) and 453(h)(1)). Without 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products, FSIS 
tentatively concluded that these 
products would be misbranded under 
section 1(n) of the FMIA or section 4(h) 
of the PPIA because the label would fail 
to reveal significant material facts about 
the consequences of consuming these 
products(66 FR 4974, January 18, 2001). 
As explained in the preamble to the 
proposed rule, although FSIS believed 
that nutrition information on the labels 
of individual packages of single- 
ingredient, raw products is useful, the 
Agency proposed that nutrition 
information for the major cuts could 
also be provided on point-of-purchase 
materials, because consumers have 
reasonable expectations as to the 
nutrient content of these products. Also, 
FSIS stated that the nutrient content of 
a given major cut is relatively uniform 
across the market, and these products 
are not formulated in the manner of 
ground or chopped products (66 FR 
4974, January 18, 2001). 
Ground or Chopped Products: Ground 
or chopped products that are multi- 
ingredient or heat processed products 
are subject to the requirements of the 
mandatory nutrition labeling program; 
therefore, these products are already 
required to bear nutrition labels, unless 
they qualify for an exemption. FSIS 
proposed to extend mandatory nutrition 
labeling requirements to all ground or 
chopped products, including single- 
ingredient, raw ground or chopped 
products, unless an exemption applies. 
Thus, FSIS proposed to require that 
nutrition labels be provided for all 
ground or chopped products (livestock 
species) and hamburger, with or without 
added seasonings, unless an exemption 
applies. Similarly, FSIS proposed to 
require that nutrition labels be provided 
for all ground or chopped poultry 
(kind), with or without added 
seasonings, unless an exemption 
applies. Under the proposed rule, 
products that would be required to bear 
nutrition labels include single- 
ingredient, raw hamburger, ground beef, 
ground beef patties, ground chicken, 
ground turkey, ground chicken patties, 
ground pork, and ground lamb. 
In the proposed rule, FSIS explained 
that, unlike other single-ingredient, raw 
products, producers are able to 
formulate precisely the fat content of 
ground or chopped products. Therefore, 
in this respect, these products are 
similar to products in the existing 
mandatory program that are required to 
bear nutrition labels (66 FR 4975, 
January 18, 2001). FSIS noted that other 
single-ingredient, raw products cannot 
be formulated in the same manner or to 
the same degree as ground beef products 
(66 FR 4976, January 18, 2001). 
FSIS noted that it believed that 
consumers could not easily see the fat 
in ground or chopped beef. In ground or 
chopped beef products, the fat is 
uniformly distributed throughout the 
product, and is not clearly 
distinguishable on the surface of the 
product (66 FR 4975, January 18, 2001). 
FSIS also explained that the Agency 
believed that consumers cannot estimate 
the level of fat in ground or chopped 
beef and cannot compare the levels of 
fat in these products to those in other 
products (66 FR 4975, January 18, 2001). 
Similarly, FSIS explained that ground 
lamb and ground pork may contain 
varying amounts of fat and varying 
nutrient content, which consumers 
cannot visually detect (66 FR 4976, 
January 18, 2001). Additionally, FSIS 
noted that producers sometimes use 
meat from advanced meat recovery 
(AMR) systems and low temperature 
rendering in ground or chopped beef or 
pork products, which can affect their 
nutrient content (66 FR 4975 and 4976, 
January 18, 2001). Finally, FSIS noted 
that, as with the fat on ground meat 
products, consumers cannot readily 
detect the fat content of ground poultry 
products (66 FR 4976, January 18, 2001). 
For these reasons, FSIS tentatively 
concluded that ground or chopped meat 
and poultry products that did not bear 
nutrition information would be 
misbranded under section 1(n)(1) of the 
FMIA and section 4(h)(1) of the PPIA 
(66 FR 4977, January 18, 2001). 
FSIS proposed to require that 
nutrition information for ground or 
chopped products appear on the label of 
these products (unless an exemption 
applies), as is required for multi- 
ingredient and heat processed products, 
rather than on point-of-purchase 
materials because ground or chopped 
products are similar to multi-ingredient 
and heat processed products in that 
certain parameters, such as their fat 
content, can be controlled precisely to 
obtain the desired product. In addition, 
because there are numerous 
formulations of ground or chopped 
products, it would be difficult for 
producers or retailers to develop point- 
of-purchase materials that would 
address all the different formulations 
that exist for these products. 
Furthermore, it would be difficult for 
consumers to find the correct 
information for a specific ground or 
chopped product on point-of-purchase 
materials that include information 
concerning numerous formulations of 
these products (66 FR 4977, January 18, 
2001). 
Exemptions: FSIS proposed that 
certain exemptions from nutrition 
labeling requirements would apply to 
the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products and ground 
or chopped meat and poultry products. 
FSIS proposed the following

67738 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
exemptions from nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products: ground or chopped products 
that qualify for the small business 
exemption in §§ 317.400(a)(1) and 
381.500(a)(1); ground or chopped 
products in packages that have a total 
surface area available to bear labeling of 
less than 12 square inches, provided 
that the product’s labeling includes no 
nutrition claims or nutrition 
information and provided that an 
address or telephone number that a 
consumer can use to obtain the required 
information is included on the label; 
ground or chopped products that are 
intended for further processing; ground 
or chopped products that are not for sale 
to consumers; ground or chopped 
products that are in small packages that 
are individually wrapped packages of 
less than 1⁄2 ounce net weight; ground or 
chopped products that are custom 
slaughtered or prepared; and ground or 
chopped products that are intended for 
export. 
FSIS proposed the following 
exemptions for major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products that are not 
ground or chopped: major cuts intended 
for further processing; major cuts not for 
sale to consumers; major cuts in small 
packages that are individually wrapped 
packages of less than 1⁄2 ounce net 
weight; major cuts that are custom 
slaughtered or prepared; and major cuts 
that are intended for export. 
FSIS proposed to exempt ground or 
chopped products that qualified for the 
small business exemption from 
nutrition labeling requirements for the 
main reason stated in the January 6, 
1993, final rule: because these 
requirements would create undue 
economic hardship for small businesses 
(58 FR 638). FSIS stated in the proposed 
rule that it did not believe that the 
reasons that necessitated the 
establishment of the small business 
exemption, as explained in the January 
6, 1993 final rule, are applicable to the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products produced by 
small businesses. For these products, 
FSIS proposed that nutrition 
information may be provided on labels 
or, alternatively, at their point-of- 
purchase. In addition, FSIS explained 
that it intended to make point-of- 
purchase materials available over the 
Internet free of charge. Therefore, the 
nutrition labeling requirement for major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw products 
should not impose an economic 
hardship for ‘‘small businesses’’, 
including those that are retail stores (66 
FR 4978, January 18, 2001). 
In the preamble to the January 6, 
1993, final rule, FSIS explained that it 
was proposing an exemption from 
nutrition labeling requirements for 
products intended for further processing 
and products not for sale to consumers 
because consumers do not see the 
nutrition information on products used 
for further processing or products that 
are not for sale to consumers. The 
Agency also explained that it would 
exempt individually wrapped packages 
of less than 1⁄2 ounce net weight, 
provided no nutrition claim or nutrition 
information was made on the label, 
because these products are an 
insignificant part of the diet. With 
regard to the custom exemption, the 
Agency explained that an exemption 
should apply because these custom 
services are performed solely for 
individuals. Finally, the Agency 
explained that products intended for 
export should be exempt because these 
products are labeled according to the 
requirements of the country where the 
product is to be exported (58 FR 639, 
January 6, 1993). In the January 18, 
2001, proposed rule, the Agency 
proposed these exemptions because the 
Agency had tentatively determined that 
the bases for these exemptions, as 
explained in the January 6, 1993, final 
rule, are valid as applied to nutrition 
labeling for ground or chopped products 
and for major cuts of single-ingredient, 
raw products. Therefore, FSIS proposed 
that any ground or chopped product or 
major cut of single-ingredient, raw 
product that qualifies for any of these 
exemptions will continue to be exempt 
(66 FR 4979, January 18, 2001). 
Under current regulations, products 
in packages that have a total surface area 
available to bear labeling of less than 12 
square inches are exempt from nutrition 
labeling, provided the product’s labeling 
includes no nutrition claims or nutrition 
information and provided that an 
address or telephone number that a 
consumer can use to obtain the required 
information is included on the label. 
FSIS allowed for nutrition information 
to be provided by alternative means for 
products of this size in order to 
incorporate sufficient flexibility in the 
regulations (58 FR 47625, January 6, 
1993). As explained in the proposed 
rule, for ground or chopped products, 
FSIS believes it is necessary to provide 
this flexibility for products in packages 
that have a total surface area available 
to bear labeling of less than 12 square 
inches, provided that the labels for these 
products bear no nutrition claims or 
nutrition information. However, because 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products may be provided on 
point-of-purchase materials, FSIS 
proposed that the provisions for 
providing nutrition labeling by alternate 
means for products in packages that 
have a total surface area available to 
bear labeling of less than 12 square 
inches would not apply to the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products (66 FR 4979, January 
18, 2001). 
In the preamble to the proposed rule, 
FSIS explained that restaurant menus 
that include ground or chopped 
products generally do not constitute 
nutrition labeling or fall within the 
scope of the proposed regulations. 
Similarly, although a restaurant menu 
would most likely not include a major 
cut of single-ingredient, raw product, if 
it did, the menu would not fall within 
the scope of the proposed regulations. 
Finally, the preamble explained that, 
under the proposed rule, any ground or 
chopped product or major cut of single- 
ingredient, raw product represented or 
purported to be specifically for infants 
and children less than 4 years of age 
would not be allowed to include certain 
nutrient content declarations, because 
infants and children less than 4 years of 
age have different nutrition needs than 
adults and children older than 4 years 
of age (66 FR 4979, January 18, 2001). 
In the 1993 final rule on nutrition 
labeling, FSIS exempted from 
mandatory nutrition labeling 
requirements multi-ingredient products 
processed at retail, and ready-to-eat 
products packaged or portioned at retail. 
The reasons that FSIS provided these 
exemptions in the 1993 final rule were 
that FSIS believed that it would be 
impractical to enforce nutrition labeling 
requirements on these products 
prepared or served at retail and because 
the Agency concluded, based on a 
review of National Food Consumption 
Survey (NFCS) data, that the average 
person’s diet consisted of an 
insignificant proportion of ready-to-eat 
retail packaged products or retail 
processed products (58 FR 639, January 
6, 1993). 
The proposed rule did not provide an 
exemption for ready-to-eat ground or 
chopped products packaged or 
portioned at retail, or multi-ingredient 
ground or chopped products that are 
processed at retail because, as FSIS 
explained in the 2001 nutrition labeling 
proposed rule, there may be a 
significant amount of multi-ingredient 
ground beef retail processed products or 
ready-to-eat retail packaged products. 
Also, FSIS explained that the Agency no 
longer believes enforcement of nutrition 
labeling requirements at retail stores to 
be impractical because FSIS is already 
conducting testing for Escherichia coli

January 18, 2001). 
For further explanation of the reasons 
for the proposed exemptions, see 66 FR 
4978–4980, January 18, 2001. 
Nonmajor Cuts of Single-Ingredient, 
Raw Meat and Poultry Products That 
Are Not Ground or Chopped: FSIS did 
not propose to require nutrition 
information for single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products that are not 
major cuts and that are not ground or 
chopped. However, FSIS proposed that 
if nutrition information is provided for 
these products, it must be provided 
according to the existing guidelines for 
the current voluntary nutrition labeling 
program. Therefore, under the proposed 
rule, if nutrition information were 
provided for these products, it would be 
consistent with the nutrition 
information required for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products. In 
the preamble to the proposed rule, FSIS 
explained that the Agency could not 
determine whether it would be 
beneficial to require nutrition labeling 
for nonmajor cuts that are not ground or 
chopped until it assessed whether 
adequate nutrition information is being 
provided for these products (66 FR 
4974, January 18, 2001). 
Enforcement and Compliance: FSIS 
conducts sampling and nutrient analysis 
of products that fall under the 
mandatory nutrition labeling program. 
FSIS proposed that the procedures set 
forth for FSIS product sampling and 
nutrient analysis in §§ 317.309(h)(1) 
through (h)(8) and 381.409(h)(1) through 
(h)(8) would be applicable to ground or 
chopped meat and to ground or 
chopped poultry products, respectively. 
FSIS explained that under the proposal, 
FSIS would sample and conduct 
nutrient analysis of ground or chopped 
products to verify compliance with 
nutrition labeling requirements, even if 
nutrition labeling on these products is 
based on the most current representative 
data base values contained in USDA’s 
National Nutrient Data Bank or the 
USDA National Nutrient Database for 
Standard Reference and there are no 
claims on the labeling. Therefore, FSIS 
would treat these products as it treats 
other products required to bear nutrition 
labels (66 FR 4980, January 18, 2001). 
FSIS explained that it would treat 
ground or chopped products in this way 
because the fat content of these products 
can vary significantly. In addition, the 
preamble to the proposed rule stated 
that FSIS employees cannot visually 
assess whether nutrition information on 
the label of ground or chopped products 
accurately reflects the labeled products’ 
contents because, in most cases, it is not 
possible to visually assess the level of 
fat in a ground or chopped product (66 
FR 4980, January 18, 2001). 
FSIS also proposed that if nutrition 
labeling of the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products (other than 
ground beef or ground pork) is based on 
USDA’s National Nutrient Data Bank or 
the USDA’s National Nutrient Database 
for Standard Reference, and there are no 
nutrition claims on the labeling, FSIS 
would not sample and conduct a 
nutrient analysis of the products. The 
preamble explained that, for the major 
cuts, FSIS personnel can visually 
identify the particular cut. FSIS further 
explained that, if the nutrition 
information for these products is based 
on USDA’s National Nutrient Data Bank 
or the USDA National Nutrient Database 
for Standard Reference, and there are no 
nutrition claims on the labeling, it is not 
necessary for FSIS to verify the accuracy 
of the data because they are USDA data. 
USDA has already evaluated these 
USDA data and determined that they are 
valid (66 FR 4980, January 18, 2001). 
Permitting Percent Lean Statements 
on labels or in labeling of ground or 
chopped products: FSIS also proposed 
to permit a statement of lean percentage 
on the label or in labeling of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products that 
do not meet the regulatory criteria for 
‘‘low fat,’’ provided that a statement of 
the fat percentage is also displayed on 
the label or in labeling. FSIS proposed 
that the required statement of fat 
percentage be contiguous to, in lettering 
of the same color, size, and type as, and 
on the same color background as, the 
statement of lean percentage. FSIS 
stated that many consumers have 
become accustomed to this labeling on 
ground beef products, and that FSIS 
believed this labeling provided a quick, 
simple, and accurate means of 
comparing all ground or chopped meat 
and poultry products (66 FR 4981, 
January 18, 2001). 
Provisions of the Supplemental 
Proposed Rule 
Major cuts and nonmajor cuts that are 
not ground or chopped: Consistent with 
the proposal, should this rule become 
final, FSIS will require nutrition 
information for the major cuts, either on 
their label or at their point-of-purchase. 
The provisions of the voluntary 
nutrition labeling program will be 
mandatory for the major cuts. As FSIS 
proposed, ‘‘ground beef regular without 
added seasonings,’’ ‘‘ground beef about 
17% fat,’’ and ‘‘ground pork’’ will no 
longer be included in the list of major 
cuts in § 317.344 because FSIS has 
decided to treat ground meat and 
poultry products differently than single 
cuts of meat for the purposes of this 
regulation. Should this rule become 
final, ground meat and poultry products 
will be required to bear nutrition 
labeling on their packages, unless an 
exemption applies. Nutrition 
information at the point-of-purchase for 
ground or chopped products will not 
meet the requirements of these 
regulations. 
FSIS believes that without nutrition 
information, consumers are not able to 
assess the nutrient content of the major 
cuts and, thus, cannot make educated 
decisions about these products based on 
nutrition information. FSIS has 
concluded that the lack of nutrition 
information for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products, either on their 
label or at their point-of-purchase, 
makes these products misbranded under 
21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1) and 453(h)(1). 
Although FSIS believes that nutrition 
information on the labels of individual 
packages of the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products is useful, this 
final rule provides that nutrition 
information for these products may be 
provided at their point-of-purchase. 
In the 1991 proposed rule and the 
1993 final rule on nutrition labeling, 
FSIS stated that if it determined, during 
any evaluation of its voluntary 
guidelines, that significant participation 
did not exist, it would initiate proposed 
rulemaking to determine whether it 
would be beneficial to require nutrition 
labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat 
and poultry products (56 FR 60306, 
November 27, 1991; 58 FR 640, January 
5, 1993). Therefore, FSIS initiated 
rulemaking to propose requiring 
nutrition labeling for the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw products. 
Through this rulemaking, FSIS has 
determined that because nutrition 
information has not been universally 
available for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient products, consumers have 
not been able to assess the nutrient 
content of these products and, thus, 
cannot make educated choices about 
them, and about the significant portion 
of their diet that these products 
represent, based on nutrition 
information. Without nutrition 
information, the labeling of major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products fails to include 
material facts about the consequences of 
consuming these products. FSIS has 
concluded that the lack of nutrition 
information for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products, either on their 
label or at their point-of-purchase, 
makes these products misbranded under 
21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1) and 453(h)(1). FSIS 
has determined that this rule is 
necessary to ensure that consumers 
obtain nutrition information concerning

these products. Through the 
supplemental proposed regulatory 
impact analysis (PRIA), FSIS has 
determined that this rule would result 
in benefits to consumers and net 
benefits to society. 
Consistent with the proposed rule, 
this supplemental proposed rule will 
not require nutrition information for 
nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products that are not 
ground or chopped. 
FSIS has determined that it is not 
appropriate or necessary to require 
nutrition information for nonmajor cuts 
that are not ground or chopped at this 
time. They do not contribute in a major 
way to the diet. Thus, at this time, the 
consequences of consuming these 
products cannot be considered to be a 
material fact. In the future, FSIS will 
reassess the production and 
consumption volume of nonmajor cuts 
that are not ground or chopped and will 
determine the levels of consumption of 
these products and whether sufficient 
nutrition information is being made 
available about them. After FSIS 
assesses the volume of these products 
and assesses the adequacy of nutrition 
information provided for them, FSIS 
will determine whether it is necessary 
to propose nutrition labeling 
requirements for these products, and 
whether nutrition labeling requirements 
for these products would be beneficial. 
Should this rule become effective, if 
establishments or retail facilities 
voluntarily provide nutrition 
information for nonmajor cuts of meat 
and poultry products that are not 
ground or chopped, they will have to 
provide it according to the nutrition 
labeling requirements for the major cuts. 
Should establishments or retail facilities 
choose to provide nutrition information 
for these products, they will have to 
either provide it at the point-of- 
purchase, in accordance with § 317.345 
or § 381.445, or on their label, in 
accordance with § 317.309 or § 381.409. 
Thus, the nutrition labeling provisions 
for these products will be consistent 
with those for the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program. 
As proposed, the supplemental 
proposed rule would allow nutrition 
information for the major cuts and 
nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products that are not ground or chopped 
to be declared on either an ‘‘as 
packaged’’ basis or an ‘‘as consumed’’ 
basis because most of these products 
will not need FSIS compliance scrutiny. 
If FSIS conducts nutrient analysis of 
products under 317.309(h) or 
381.409(h), it does so on the packaged 
product. If nutrition information for 
these products is based on USDA’s 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference, and there are no claims on 
the labeling, FSIS will not conduct a 
nutrient analysis of these raw products 
and, therefore, will not evaluate ‘‘as 
packaged’’ nutrition labeling 
information for these products. 
Also consistent with the proposed 
rule, under this supplemental proposed 
rule, the declaration of the number of 
servings per container would not need 
to be included on the nutrition label for 
the major or nonmajor cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products that are not 
ground or chopped, because these 
products are typically random weight 
products. Existing regulations do not 
require the number of servings on the 
nutrition label of random weight 
products (see §§ 317.309(b)(10)(iii) and 
381.409(b)(10)(iii)). 
Ground or Chopped Products: 
Consistent with the proposed rule, this 
supplemental proposed rule would 
extend the mandatory nutrition labeling 
requirements to all ground or chopped 
products, including single-ingredient, 
raw ground or chopped products, unless 
an exemption applies. Should this rule 
become effective, FSIS will require that 
nutrition labels be provided for all 
ground or chopped products (livestock 
species) and hamburger, with or without 
added seasonings, unless an exemption 
applies. This rule would also require 
that nutrition labels be provided for all 
ground or chopped poultry products, 
with or without added seasonings, 
unless an exemption applies. After 
analyzing the comments and for the 
reasons discussed in the proposed rule 
and discussed below in the response to 
comments section, FSIS has concluded 
that ground or chopped meat and 
poultry products that do not bear 
nutrition information on their label are 
misbranded under 21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1) 
and 453(h)(1). 
FSIS recognizes that single-ingredient, 
raw ground or chopped products have 
not been required to bear nutrition 
labels. In the proposed rule, FSIS 
explained that, on June 3, 1997, the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest 
(CSPI) submitted a petition to the 
Agency stating that FSIS should require 
complete ‘‘Nutrition Facts’’ on ground 
beef labels that make nutrient content 
claims. This petition brought many of 
the issues concerning the need for 
nutrition labeling of ground or chopped 
products to FSIS’s attention. Consistent 
with CSPI’s petition, FSIS has 
determined that nutrition information 
should be required on packages of all 
ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products, unless an exemption applies. 
(For more information on the petition 
from CSPI, see 66 FR 4975, January 18, 
2001). 
Most industry commenters did not 
support requiring on-package nutrition 
information for ground or chopped 
products. Some of these commenters 
supported requiring nutrition labeling 
for these products at their point-of- 
purchase. Individuals, consumer 
organizations, and nutrition 
organizations supported mandatory 
nutrition labeling on the packages of 
ground or chopped products. 
FSIS requests comments on how 
retailers or official establishments 
would prepare point-of-purchase 
materials that would address all 
possible combinations of percent fat and 
percent lean in ground or chopped 
products. FSIS also requests comments 
on how point-of-purchase materials 
would convey the nutrient values of 
ground or chopped products that 
contain AMR product or product from 
low temperature rendering (e.g., finely 
textured beef or lean finely textured 
beef). In addition, FSIS requests 
comments on how consumers would 
identify which nutrient values on point- 
of-purchase materials correspond to 
specific ground or chopped products 
available in the store, if a statement of 
fat percentage or lean percentage is not 
required on the product. Such 
statements would not be required under 
this supplemental proposed rule. 
Finally, FSIS requests surveys, studies, 
or other data on consumers’ perception 
and use of point-of-purchase materials 
versus nutrition labels for ground or 
chopped products and on consumers’ 
understanding of the nutrient content of 
such products. 
Exemptions: This supplemental 
proposal would provide all the 
exemptions that it proposed for the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products and for 
ground or chopped products for the 
reasons set forth in the proposal. 
Consistent with the proposed rule, it 
does not provide an exemption for 
ready-to-eat ground or chopped 
products packaged or portioned at retail 
or multi-ingredient ground or chopped 
products that are processed at retail. As 
FSIS explained in the 2001 nutrition 
labeling proposed rule, there may be a 
significant amount of multi-ingredient 
ground beef retail processed products or 
ready-to-eat retail packaged products. 
Also, as was stated in the proposed rule, 
FSIS no longer believes enforcement of 
nutrition labeling requirements at retail 
stores to be impractical because FSIS is 
already conducting testing for E. coli 
O157:H7 at retail. 
In response to comments, the 
supplemental proposal provides an

exemption from nutrition labeling 
requirements for products that are 
ground or chopped at an individual 
customer’s request and that are prepared 
and served or sold at retail, provided 
that the labels or labeling of these 
products bear no nutrition claims or 
nutrition information. 
Enforcement and Compliance: 
Consistent with the proposed rule and 
the reasons discussed in it, under this 
supplemental proposed rule, FSIS 
would sample and conduct nutrient 
analysis of ground or chopped products 
to verify compliance with nutrition 
labeling requirements, even if nutrition 
labeling on these products is based on 
the most current representative database 
values contained in USDA’s National 
Nutrient Data Bank or the USDA 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference and there are no claims on the 
labeling. Also consistent with the 
proposed rule, for the major cuts that 
are not ground or chopped, if nutrition 
labeling of these products is based on 
USDA’s National Nutrient Data Bank or 
the USDA’s National Nutrient Database 
for Standard Reference, and there are no 
nutrition claims on the labeling, FSIS 
would not sample and conduct a 
nutrient analysis of these products. 
Permitting Percent Lean Statements 
on labels or in labeling of ground or 
chopped products: Consistent with the 
proposed rule, the supplemental 
proposed rule would permit a statement 
of lean percentage on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped meat and 
poultry products that do not meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat,’’ as long 
as a statement of fat percentage is 
contiguous to, in lettering of the same 
color, size, and type as, and on the same 
color background as, the statement of 
lean percentage. Because the percent fat 
statement must be contiguous to the 
percent lean statement and must be in 
lettering of the same color, size, and 
type as, and on the same color 
background as, the lean percentage 
statement, FSIS believes that the percent 
lean statements will not mislead 
consumers. 
Under the proposed rule, if small 
businesses produced ground or chopped 
product and included a statement of 
lean percentage and fat percentage on 
the product’s label or in labeling, the 
business would have been required to 
include nutrition information on the 
product label. Based on the National 
Cattleman’s Beef Association (NCBA) 
National Meat Case Study in 2004, 93 
percent of ground beef packages had 
statements of lean or fat percentages. 
Sixty-eight percent of packages with 
such statements had nutrition facts 
panels and 25 percent did not. Because 
25 percent of ground beef packages in 
the NCBA study had statements of lean 
or fat percentages but did not have 
nutrition facts panels, FSIS found it 
reasonable to conclude that many small 
businesses may include a statement of 
the lean percentage on the label of 
ground products but may not include 
nutrition facts panels on the product 
label. On this basis, FSIS concluded that 
requiring small businesses that use the 
lean percentage statement on the label 
of ground products to also include 
nutrition information on the label of 
such products may result in significant 
expenses for small businesses. 
Therefore, in this supplemental 
proposed rule, small businesses that use 
statements of percent fat and percent 
lean on the label or in labeling of 
ground products would be exempt from 
nutrition labeling requirements, 
provided they include no other 
nutrition claims or nutrition 
information on the product labels or 
labeling. 
The majority of industry associations 
supported the use of a statement of lean 
percentage on the label or in labeling of 
ground products that do not meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat.’’ Because 
of the longstanding use of the 
statements of percent fat and percent 
lean on the label or in labeling of 
ground beef and hamburger products, 
FSIS has concluded that such 
statements on the label or in labeling of 
ground products produced by small 
businesses will not mislead consumers, 
even if the small businesses do not 
include nutrition information on the 
products’ labels. 
However, individuals and consumer 
and nutrition organizations generally 
did not support the use of statements of 
lean percentages on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
that do not meet the regulatory criteria 
for ‘‘low fat.’’ Therefore, FSIS requests 
comments on whether such statements 
should be prohibited on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
that do not meet the regulatory criteria 
for ‘‘low fat.’’ FSIS requests comments 
on whether lean percentage statements 
are inherently misleading to consumers 
on the label or in labeling of ground or 
chopped product that does not meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat’’ when 
contiguous to fat percentage statements, 
as the rule would require. FSIS also 
requests comments on whether lean 
percentage statements are redundant on 
the label or in labeling of such products 
when contiguous to fat percentage 
statements. If commenters believe the 
regulations should prohibit lean 
percentage statements on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
that do not meet the ‘‘low fat’’ criteria, 
FSIS requests comments on whether a 
fat percentage statement on the label or 
in labeling of such products would be 
useful. If commenters believe such a 
statement would be useful, do they 
believe it should be required on the 
label or in labeling for these products? 
FSIS also requests comments on 
whether the final rule should allow a 
lean percentage statement and fat 
percentage statement on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
produced by small businesses if such 
product does not include nutrition 
information on the product label. If 
commenters believe that nutrition 
information should be required on 
labels of any ground or chopped 
product for which a lean percentage and 
fat percentage statement is provided on 
the label or in labeling, FSIS requests 
comment on the costs of this 
requirement for small businesses. 
FSIS requests copies of surveys, 
studies, or other data on consumers’ use 
and understanding of lean percentage 
and fat percentage statements on ground 
or chopped products. 
Effective Date 
Should this rule become final, FSIS 
intends that the requirements for ground 
or chopped products would become 
effective on January 1, 2012. FSIS issued 
final regulations to establish this date as 
the uniform compliance date for new 
food labeling regulations that are issued 
between January 1, 2009, and December 
31, 2010 (73 FR 75564; December 12, 
2008). As is discussed in the response 
to comments below, FSIS issued the 
uniform compliance regulations to 
minimize costs associated with on- 
package labels. Because this 
supplemental proposed rule would 
allow for the presentation of nutrition 
information for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products at their point-of-purchase, 
FSIS intends to make the labeling 
requirements for the major cuts effective 
one year from the date of publication of 
the final rule. FSIS requests comments 
on these two planned effective dates. 
Availability of Nutrition Information 
FSIS intends to make available 
nutrition labeling materials that can be 
used at the point-of-purchase of the 
major cuts at the following Internet 
address: http://www.fsis.usda.gov. Also, 
the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) has 
made available materials that can be 
used at the point-of-purchase of the 
major cuts at the following Internet 
address: http://www.fmi.org/consumer/ 
nutrifacts/.

The USDA National Nutrient Database 
for Standard Reference is developed and 
maintained by the Agricultural Research 
Service (ARS) and can be found on the 
Internet at the following address: http:// 
www.ars.usda.gov\nutrientdata. 
Information is available at this site for 
ground beef products containing 5%, 
10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% fat. In 
addition, ARS has included a calculator 
on the Internet, with the Database. 
Parties can enter the amount of fat (5% 
to 30% percent fat) or lean (70% to 95% 
lean) in a particular raw ground beef 
product, and the calculator will 
calculate the nutrient values for the 
product based on the fat value entered. 
The USDA National Nutrient Database 
for Standard Reference also includes a 
set of tables with nutrient values for 
ground pork with fat levels from 4 to 
28%, in one percent increments. ARS 
did not develop a calculator because, at 
this time, labeling for ground pork at 
retail does not include statements of 
percentage fat or percentage lean. The 
USDA Nutrient Database also includes 
nutrient values for raw and cooked 
ground chicken but does not include 
nutrient values for such product at 
varying fat levels. Ground chicken is not 
typically produced over a wide range of 
fat levels. ARS also has nutrient data for 
three types of commonly marketed 
ground turkey products. Nutrient values 
for these products are not yet in the 
database. However, ARS expects that 
the nutrient values for these ground 
turkey products will be available in the 
database by August 2010. Most ground 
poultry products are produced and 
labeled at Federal establishments rather 
than at retail. 
FSIS requests comments on whether 
provision of nutritional tables will be 
sufficient for retailers and 
establishments to provide nutrition 
labels for ground pork. FSIS also 
requests comments on whether the 
available data for ground chicken and 
ground turkey in the USDA Nutrient 
Database will be sufficient for retailers 
and establishments. 
Below are examples of nutrition labels 
for ground or chopped products that 
would meet the requirements of the 
supplemental proposed rule. Should 
this rule become final, FSIS will make 
additional examples of acceptable 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
products available on the Agency’s Web 
site.

BILLING CODE 3410–DM–C 
Summary of and Response to 
Comments 
FSIS received approximately 5,000 
comments on the proposed rule from 
individuals, consumer advocacy 
organizations, academia, trade and 
professional associations, health and 
nutrition organizations, two county 
health departments, meat and poultry 
producers, and food retailers. The 
majority of the comments 
(approximately 3,500) were generated 
from a letter writing campaign initiated 
by a consumer organization. In addition, 
there were approximately 450 form 
letters that expressed consumers’ 
concerns and did not identify an 
affiliation with any organization, 
approximately 60 form letters from a 
consumer co-op organization, and two 
sets of form letters from relatively small 
retail chains (approximately 10 letters in 
each set). 
A summary of issues raised by 
commenters and the Agency responses 
follows. 
Nutrition Labeling for the Major Cuts of 
Single-Ingredient, Raw Meat and 
Poultry Products 
Comment: The majority of letters from 
individuals, consumer groups, and 
health organizations stated that FSIS 
should require on-package nutrition 
labeling for all single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products (major and 
nonmajor cuts). They stated that point- 
of-purchase materials fail to convey 
effectively the nutrition information for 
specific fresh meat or poultry products 
because the materials are difficult to 
find and difficult to read. Some of these 
commenters also stated that nutrition 
labels are particularly important for 
meat and poultry products because they 
are a major source of fat, saturated fatty 
acids, and calories. 
A health organization stated that 
because the same cut of meat can be 
labeled by different names, consumers 
would be better served by nutrition 
information on the labels of the 
products. Several commenters stated 
that an advantage of including nutrition 
information on the label is that 
consumers could review the nutrient 
content once the product is taken home, 
and others, besides the primary food 
purchaser, would have better access to 
the nutrition information. A nutrition 
association stated that if FSIS permits 
point-of-purchase information for fresh 
meat and poultry packages, the Agency 
should require on-package messages 
directing consumers to point-of- 
purchase labeling at another location in 
the store. 
One consumer association noted that 
a recent telephone survey showed an 
overwhelming percentage (78%) of the 
respondents said that it was ‘‘more 
useful’’ to provide nutrition information 
about raw meat and poultry products on 
package labels than on posters or 
brochures. 
Comments from a coalition of health 
and consumer organizations suggested 
that the nutrient content for ground 
products often has less variance than 
the nutrient content of specific cuts. 
Thus, the coalition believes that it is 
more important to provide nutrition 
information on the labeling of major 
cuts than on ground products. The 
coalition also stated that the reasons 
provided by the Agency for mandating 
nutrition labeling on the packaging of 
ground products would be the reasons 
for mandating nutrition labeling on

also stated that there are more major 
cuts than there are ground products, and 
it would be difficult for producers or 
retailers to develop point-of-purchase 
materials to address the different 
formulations and trim levels of the 
major cuts; and it would be difficult for 
consumers to locate the appropriate 
information for a particular cut on the 
point-of-purchase materials. 
One health group stated that although 
on-package labeling may be a more 
effective approach for conveying 
nutrition information than point-of- 
purchase materials, the organization has 
historically supported the use of point- 
of-purchase materials as an acceptable 
means of nutrition labeling. This 
commenter also stated that for single- 
ingredient, raw products, other than 
ground or chopped products, the use of 
standardized averages is likely to be the 
most effective way to provide nutrition 
information, either on the package or at 
point-of-purchase. An individual also 
stated that for many major cuts, having 
the nutrition label next to the product 
would be sufficient. 
A consumer organization did not 
believe that consumers have reasonable 
expectations as to the nutrient content, 
including the fat, of raw meat and 
poultry products. The organization 
referenced a consumer telephone survey 
in which most respondents were unable 
to identify which cut of meat had the 
highest fat content among four choices. 
One medical organization stated that 
although it may be true that the nutrient 
content of the major cuts is relatively 
uniform, consumers generally have no 
idea of the nutrient content of these 
foods. 
The majority of industry and industry 
associations supported the continued 
use of point-of-purchase nutrition 
information materials for the major cuts, 
rather than nutrition labels on the 
packages of these products. Two of 
these groups presented results of focus 
group research demonstrating that 
consumers currently understand and 
use point-of-purchase materials in 
numbers comparable to the number of 
consumers who read and use the 
nutrition information on the labeling of 
products subject to the requirements of 
the mandatory nutrition labeling 
program. Additionally, according to the 
commenters, the focus group research 
demonstrates that consumers are 
generally satisfied with the current 
nutrition information provided for fresh 
meats. 
One industry association stated that 
the use of individual nutrition labels 
may result in consumers’ viewing a 
smaller portion of the product and 
paying a higher amount for the product, 
because of the cost associated with 
maintaining a vast number of labels to 
be placed on the package. Additionally, 
according to this commenter, if the 
consumer intends to trim the fat from 
meat or remove the skin from poultry 
products, the nutrition information on 
the label would not adequately 
represent the product’s nutrition 
information after fat had been trimmed 
from it or skin from it had been 
removed. 
One industry commenter stated that it 
is extremely difficult to provide 
accurate nutrition information for each 
major muscle cut because nutrient 
content varies depending on the breed 
and quality of each animal. Another 
industry commenter stated that 
although ‘‘average’’ numbers from the 
USDA database are appropriate for 
point-of-purchase materials, because of 
the potential variations in specific 
individual cuts, trims and grades, the 
average numbers are not appropriate for 
on-package labeling, where consumers 
justifiably expect a label to accurately 
define the exact nutrient content of 
what is in that package. 
Two industry commenters stated that 
according to the Agency’s own survey, 
62.7% of men and 57.9% of women 
rarely or never use the nutrition 
information provided on raw meat, 
poultry or fish (see 66 FR 4982, January 
18, 2001). They speculated that this low 
usage may in part be explained by the 
fact that consumers already have 
reasonable expectations regarding the 
nutrient values of these products as a 
result of industry’s voluntary efforts to 
provide this information. Similarly, one 
retail association stated that consumers 
have reasonable expectations as to the 
nutrient content of major cuts, and that 
the nutrient content of a given major cut 
is relatively uniform across the market. 
An industry commenter stated that, 
unlike ground meat, consumers can see 
and remove the fat from whole muscle 
meat. 
Another industry organization stated 
that single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products have a unique quality: 
the structure of the cut, including the 
amount of fat, is visible both on the 
exterior and within the muscle cut. As 
a result, consumers can visibly discern 
which products are leanest. However, 
the commenter also believed that 
consumers would benefit from 
additional nutrition information 
because consumers cannot discern the 
quantitative nutrient content of single- 
ingredient, meat and poultry products 
without the nutrition information 
provided on point-of-purchase 
materials. 
Response: As FSIS proposed, should 
this rule become final, it will require 
that nutrition information be provided 
for the major cuts of single-ingredient, 
raw meat and poultry products, either 
on the label or at the point-of-purchase. 
Although FSIS continues to agree with 
the commenters who stated that 
nutrition labels on the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw products are 
useful, FSIS believes that consumers 
have reasonable expectations as to the 
nutrient content of these products and 
can make comparative judgments about 
the fat content of the various cuts. While 
consumers’ expectations for these 
products may not be perfect, they are 
significantly more aware of the 
nutritional content of single cuts of meat 
than the nutritional content of ground 
meat. Thus, the rule allows an 
alternative way of providing nutrition 
information for major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products. As is 
discussed above, even though FSIS 
believes that consumers have reasonable 
expectations concerning the nutrient 
content of the major cuts, without 
nutrition information for these products, 
consumers cannot assess specific 
nutrient levels in them and cannot make 
educated choices about consuming 
them. These educated choices are 
significant to a consumer’s effort to 
construct a healthy diet. 
FSIS does not believe that the 
telephone survey results used by a 
consumer organization in support of 
their belief that most consumers do not 
have reasonable expectations of the 
nutrient content of raw meat and 
poultry demonstrate that consumers do 
not have reasonable expectations 
concerning the major cuts. FSIS does 
not believe it is reasonable to expect 
consumers in a telephone survey to be 
able to identify which individual cuts of 
meat or poultry have the highest fat 
levels. However, if shown pictures of 
the various cuts (that are not ground or 
chopped), FSIS believes that most 
consumers could identify the cut with 
the most fat, by its internal marbling 
and external fat cover. The medical 
organization commenter that stated that 
consumers generally have no idea of the 
nutrient content of the major cuts 
provided no data to substantiate this 
statement. 
Although individuals, and consumer 
organization commenters, stated that 
point-of-purchase materials are difficult 
to read, they provided no explanation 
for their assertion that these materials 
are difficult to read. Their other concern 
about the difficulty of finding point-of- 
purchase materials will be taken care of

67746 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
by this rule. Should it become final, the 
rule will require that point-of-purchase 
materials be made available in close 
proximity to the food (§ 317.345(a)(3) 
and § 381.445(a)(3)). 
Regarding the health organization’s 
comment that the same cut of meat can 
be labeled by different names, and thus 
consumers would be better informed by 
nutrition information on a product’s 
label, FSIS is not aware that consumers 
are confused about the names of the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products listed on point-of-purchase 
materials. FMI was involved in 
developing these materials, and that 
organization has the most current names 
used to designate the major cuts. 
However, if necessary, retail facilities 
and establishments can include 
multiple names for a major cut on point- 
of-purchase materials. In addition, if 
FSIS is informed of specific cuts that are 
identified by different names, FSIS will 
revise the point-of-purchase materials 
that it is making available on the 
Internet. 
After the comment period for the 
proposed rule ended, FSIS received 
correspondence from industry stating 
that the list of major cuts in the 
regulations should be changed to reflect 
more accurately the most popular cuts 
in the market. This correspondence 
recommended removing certain cuts 
and adding others. Because FSIS did not 
propose to amend the codified list of 
major cuts in the regulations and did 
not provide an opportunity for the 
public to comment on proposed changes 
to the list, FSIS is not amending the list 
of major cuts in the regulations at this 
time. However, FSIS will review this 
issue, and if the Agency determines that 
a change in the list of major cuts is 
warranted to accurately represent the 
market, FSIS will pursue future 
rulemaking. 
Regarding the comments that noted 
that an advantage of including nutrition 
information on the label is that 
consumers can review the nutrient 
content of the product once the product 
is taken home, and others besides the 
primary food purchaser would have 
better access to this information, 
surveys, including the Diet and Health 
Knowledge Survey (DHKS), show that a 
majority of individuals report using 
labels while buying foods. Although the 
DHKS shows that adults who are not 
main household shoppers use labels, the 
survey shows that the main shoppers 
use labels at a higher rate than those 
who are not main household shoppers. 
Also, FSIS assumes that if individuals 
in a household have certain nutrition 
practices and needs, the person who 
purchases food for the household would 
take other household members’ needs 
and preferences into account. In 
addition, FSIS assumes that purchased 
food would typically be consumed by 
members of the household and not 
thrown away. 
In response to the comment that the 
nutrient content of the major cuts may 
be more variable than that of ground 
products, FSIS recognizes that there is 
significant variability in the nutrient 
content of the major cuts depending on 
the grade of the product and the levels 
of exterior fat on the products. However, 
the point-of-purchase materials that 
FSIS and FMI have developed to convey 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
take into account this variability and 
reflect average nutrition information for 
these products. The information on the 
point-of-purchase materials is 
meaningful and accurate for the major 
cuts. Consumers can view the point-of- 
purchase materials to make educated 
choices based on nutrition information 
among the different major cuts. In 
addition, to further distinguish among 
different packages of the same major 
cut, consumers can make comparisons 
based on levels of visible fat on the 
product. 
This coalition’s other concern that it 
would be difficult for producers or 
retailers to develop point-of-purchase 
materials to address the different 
formulations and trim levels of the 
major cuts need not be a concern. FSIS 
and FMI have made available nutrition 
information that can be displayed at the 
point-of-purchase of the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products. These point-of-purchase 
materials will meet the nutrition 
labeling requirements of this rule, 
should it become final. Furthermore, 
requiring that all major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products bear nutrition labels would be 
a significant cost to the industry based 
on FSIS’s supplemental proposed cost 
analysis. 
Comment: Two industry commenters 
stated that it was appropriate for FSIS 
to provide point-of-purchase materials 
via the Internet. They believed that this 
would lessen the burden on retailers 
unable to develop appropriate 
customized nutrition information. One 
of these commenters also stated that the 
Agency should develop point-of- 
purchase materials so that the nutrition 
information supplied would be accurate 
and consistent. 
With regard to the type of point-of- 
purchase materials used to display 
nutrition information, several 
commenters stated that easy to 
understand charts that convey the 
information would be more helpful and 
informative to consumers than a 
collection of individual labels on 
display. One industry organization 
commenter, however, stated that each 
option of the display of nutrition 
information on charts or on individual 
display panels had advantages. This 
industry organization believed that the 
presentation of information in charts 
which have vertical and horizontal 
columns, that cover multiple products, 
would allow consumers to make 
comparisons and would consume less 
space than individual labels. This 
organization also stated that charts are 
readily available to retailers. However, 
this organization felt that consumers 
might be more familiar with single 
nutrition panels than with nutrition 
charts covering multiple products. 
Nevertheless, this organization believed 
that the provision of nutrition panels for 
every major cut at their point-of- 
purchase would be costly and would 
consume a significant amount of space 
in retail settings. Thus, the organization 
concluded that retailers should have the 
freedom to present nutrition 
information in any way that suits 
customer needs, so long as it is not 
misleading. Accordingly, the 
commenter suggested that USDA 
conduct research to determine the best 
method of presenting such information. 
Several industry commenters stated 
that the Agency should describe the 
information required but should not 
prescribe a specific format or 
presentation of the information so that 
retailers that want to develop 
customized point-of-purchase materials 
can develop customized materials. 
These commenters believed it was 
important to provide as much flexibility 
in the development of nutrition 
materials as possible. One of these 
commenters also stated that the Agency 
should only prescribe the specific 
required presentation of the nutrition 
information after significant consumer 
testing. 
Response: The Agency will provide 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products that 
retailers can use at point-of-purchase at 
the following Internet address: http:// 
www.fsis.usda.gov. Point-of-purchase 
materials are also available from FMI at 
the following Internet address: http:// 
www.fmi.org. At this time, FSIS intends 
to provide information on charts with 
columns that cover multiple products, 
rather than providing a compilation of 
individual nutrition facts panels. The 
Agency does not intend to conduct 
consumer surveys or additional research 
to determine whether individual 
nutrition labels or charts covering 
multiple products would best address

consumer needs because most 
comments received on this issue 
supported the use of charts covering 
multiple products. 
The Agency agrees with commenters 
that it is important to provide as much 
flexibility as possible in the 
presentation of nutrition information on 
point-of-purchase materials for the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products. Therefore, should this rule 
become final, FSIS will allow point-of- 
purchase nutrition information for the 
major cuts to be presented through a 
variety of means, including signs, 
brochures, notebooks, or leaflets in close 
proximity to the food. The nutrition 
labeling information may also be 
supplemented by a video, live 
demonstration, or other media. 
Furthermore, if there is no nutrition 
claim made on the point-of-purchase 
materials, they will not be subject to any 
of the format requirements applicable to 
on-package nutrition labels. However, if 
a nutrition claim is made on the point- 
of-purchase materials, all of the format 
and content requirements applicable to 
on-package nutrition labels in 
§§ 317.309 and 381.409 will apply. 
Consistent with existing voluntary 
and mandatory nutrition labeling 
program regulations, should this rule 
become final, the Agency will provide 
more flexibility for the presentation of 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
at the point-of-purchase than for the 
presentation of nutrition information on 
labels. FSIS believes this is appropriate 
and necessary because there is no small 
business exemption from nutrition 
labeling requirements for the major cuts. 
Also, FSIS does not want to impose any 
burden on retailers that are following 
the voluntary guidelines for voluntary 
nutrition labeling. 
Comment: One animal protection 
organization supported allowing 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products to be 
provided on an ‘‘as packaged’’ basis, as 
opposed to an ‘‘as consumed’’ basis, 
because there are numerous cooking 
methods, and the cooking method used 
could affect the nutrient content of the 
product. In addition, one industry 
association supported allowing 
nutrition information to be provided on 
an ‘‘as consumed’’ basis for the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw products. 
Response: As proposed, for the major 
cuts and nonmajor cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products, should this 
rule become final, it will allow nutrition 
information on the label or on point-of- 
purchase materials to be declared on 
either an ‘‘as packaged’’ basis or ‘‘as 
consumed’’ basis because, as noted in 
the proposed rule, most of the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products will not need FSIS 
compliance scrutiny (66 FR 4974, 
January 18, 2001). If nutrition 
information for these products is based 
on USDA’s National Nutrient Database 
for Standard Reference, and there are no 
claims on the labeling, FSIS will not 
conduct a nutrient analysis of these raw 
products and, therefore, will not 
evaluate ‘‘as packaged’’ nutrition 
labeling information for these products. 
Consistent with the provisions in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program, 
when nutrition information is presented 
on an ‘‘as consumed’’ basis, retailers or 
manufacturers will be required to 
specify a method of cooking that will 
not add nutrients from other ingredients 
such as flour, breading, and salt 
(§§ 317.345(d) and 381.445(d)). FSIS 
welcomes further comment on this 
issue. 
Comment: An industry association 
and animal protection organization 
agreed that it was unrealistic to state the 
‘‘servings per container’’ on the 
nutrition labels of the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw products because 
the majority of these products are 
random weight items. 
Response: FSIS agrees that the 
number of serving per container is not 
necessary information on the nutrition 
labels of the major cuts or nonmajor cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products, 
because these products are typically 
random weight products. For multi- 
ingredient and heat-processed products 
that must bear nutrition labels, the 
number of servings is not required on 
random weight products 
(§§ 317.309(b)(10)(iii) and 
381.409(b)(10)(iii)). 
Comment: Several industry groups 
believed that the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program should remain in 
place, and that FSIS should not require 
nutrition labeling of the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw products. One 
retail association stated that FSIS could 
improve voluntary compliance with 
nutrition labeling guidelines without 
requiring nutrition labeling for the 
major cuts by making the same free 
information available that it plans to 
make available under the new 
regulations. Similarly, a form letter that 
multiple retailers submitted stated that 
FSIS could increase compliance with 
the voluntary guidelines at less cost to 
consumers than the regulations would 
generate by providing free and updated 
information to retailers. Several 
individuals stated that the USDA should 
not establish new labeling requirements 
for meat products because they believed 
that current labeling on these products 
is sufficient. 
As noted above, two commenters 
stated that according to the Agency’s 
own data, 62.7% of men and 57.9% of 
women rarely or never use nutrition 
information on raw meat, poultry or 
fish. Given such low usage, the 
commenters stated that FSIS should not 
require nutrition labeling for the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw products 
but should be more flexible in 
encouraging greater participation in the 
voluntary program. 
Two industry commenters questioned 
the accuracy of the USDA surveys that 
did not find significant participation in 
the voluntary nutrition labeling 
program. They stated that the USDA 
surveys in 1996 and in 1999 checked 
only for the presence of the ‘‘new’’ 
formatted nutrition information; one of 
these commenters stated that FSIS did 
not announce in the Federal Register 
that only ‘‘new’’ materials would be 
considered. 
These commenters also noted that 
FSIS determined whether significant 
participation in the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program existed based on the 
number of stores found to be in 
compliance. However, these 
commenters stated that equal 
consideration should have been given to 
the volume of product for which 
nutrition information was provided and 
the numbers of shoppers given access to 
the information. These commenters 
noted that volume-weighted 
participation would have represented 60 
percent participation in the voluntary 
nutrition labeling program. 
One of the commenters that 
questioned the accuracy of the surveys 
also stated that the surveys were not 
conducted every two years; it is not 
clear that every chain company was 
included; neither the 1996 nor the 1999 
survey reported on nutrition 
information that was applied in label 
form directly to the package; and the 
surveys may have included stores that 
the organization believes should be 
exempt from the nutrition labeling 
guidelines. The other commenter that 
questioned the accuracy of the surveys 
stated that, given a variance factor of 4% 
(a conservative margin of error based on 
2,000 stores, according to the survey 
reports), store participation could have 
been 70.5% in 1995, 61.5% in 1996, and 
58.5% in 1999. In other words, FSIS 
could have found significant 
participation existed in two of the 
surveys. 
Response: FSIS continues to believe 
that nutrition information for the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw products 
is important and necessary. In addition, 
FSIS believes that requiring nutrition 
labeling of the major cuts of single- 
VerDate Nov<24>2008 14:59 Dec 17, 2009 Jkt 220001 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\18DEP2.SGM 18DEP2ero

ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products will result in benefits. FSIS 
did encourage participation in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
through meetings with industry. 
Further, nutrition labeling materials for 
the major cuts have been available on 
FMI’s Web site for several years 
(http://www.fmi.org). Despite this and 
FSIS’s encouragement of the use of such 
materials, the 1999 voluntary nutrition 
labeling survey found a lower rate of 
participation than the 1996 survey 
found. Thus, the fact that nutrition 
information was available was 
insufficient to ensure consumers 
received the necessary nutrition 
information. By making the guidelines 
currently in place for the voluntary 
nutrition labeling program mandatory, 
FSIS will ensure that consumers are 
provided with necessary nutrition 
information concerning the major cuts. 
To determine how much of a 
behavioral response and change in 
dietary intake might result from 
providing more nutrition information on 
meat and poultry products in the 
proposed rule’s benefits analysis, FSIS 
assumed that when labels and other 
sources of nutrition information were 
provided for raw meat and poultry 
products, the usage rates would rise to 
match nutrition label usage rates for 
food products as a whole (66 FR 4990, 
January 18, 2001). As FSIS noted, 
although some information was being 
provided for some single-ingredient, 
raw meat and poultry products, 
nutrition information for these products 
was not required. FSIS noted it could be 
reasonably assumed that when nutrition 
information becomes mandatory, more 
consumers will use the nutrition 
information for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products. 
FSIS does not believe that the surveys 
conducted to determine whether there 
was significant participation in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
were inaccurate because they were not 
conducted precisely every two years or 
because of the manner in which FSIS 
determined whether there was 
significant participation. FSIS’s 
regulations provide that the Agency 
would evaluate significant participation 
every 2 years (§§ 317.343(e) and 
381.443(e)). However, the timing of 
these surveys did not make them 
invalid. Although FSIS did not conduct 
the surveys precisely 2 years apart, the 
Agency conducted the surveys 
approximately every two years. 
Further, the survey conducted in June 
1995 included as participants in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
those retailers who displayed at point- 
of-purchase either materials that were 
developed before or after issuance of the 
1993 final rule on nutrition labeling. 
The older nutrition information 
materials, which were developed in 
1992, did not comply entirely with the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
provisions in the 1993 final rule. For 
example, the older materials did not 
include the required percent daily 
values for certain nutrients. Therefore, 
the results of the 1995 survey may have 
actually overestimated participation in 
the voluntary nutrition labeling 
program. 
Additionally, the 1996 and 1999 
surveys correctly only counted a store as 
providing voluntary nutrition 
information for meat and poultry 
products if it displayed point-of- 
purchase materials that were developed 
after the final rule was published. FSIS 
program officials had decided that by 
1996 retailers had had enough time to 
obtain the updated nutrition labeling 
materials for display in their stores. 
FSIS did not announce in the Federal 
Register that only ‘‘new’’ materials 
would be considered to meet the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
guidelines. However, FSIS met with 
industry organizations and informed 
them that, in the 1996 survey, the 
Agency would only consider ‘‘new’’ 
materials to meet the voluntary 
nutrition labeling program guidelines. It 
could reasonably be expected that stores 
that were participating in the program 
would replace the materials over the 
course of three years. 
Moreover, consistent with its stated 
intention to sample all chain companies 
(58 FR 640, January 6, 1993), the 
contractor that conducted the surveys 
on behalf of FSIS used various sources 
to sample all chains, including Retail 
Diagnostics, Inc.’s listing of 
supermarkets, Progressive Grocer 
Marketing Guidebook, Progressive 
Grocer MarketScope, Chain Store Guide 
Directory of Supermarkets & 
Convenience Store Chains, and the 
latest U.S. Economic Census. Moreover, 
although the surveys do not report the 
number of stores found to be providing 
nutrition information on package labels, 
the surveys did take this into account. 
Retailers were considered to be 
participating in the voluntary program 
when they provided nutrition 
information on nutrition labels or on 
point-of-purchase materials, in 
accordance with program guidelines, for 
at least 90 percent of the major cuts sold 
at the facility. 
FSIS correctly did not make a 
determination of whether there was 
significant participation in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
based on the volume of product for 
which nutrition information was 
provided and the number of shoppers 
given access to the information. FSIS 
regulations clearly provide that a 
determination of whether significant 
participation in the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program existed was to be 
based on the percentage of companies 
evaluated that were participating in 
accordance with the guidelines. 
Significant participation would exist if 
at least 60 percent of all companies that 
were evaluated were participating in 
accordance with the guidelines. As is 
explained above, the term ‘‘companies,’’ 
as used in the regulations, refers to 
individual stores. The preamble to the 
1993 nutrition labeling rule stated, 
‘‘FSIS will use a representative sample 
of stores to obtain the information 
necessary to assess participation’’ (58 
FR 640, January 6, 1993). FSIS 
developed these regulations through 
notice and comment rulemaking, and 
FSIS conducted the surveys consistent 
with the regulations and the 1993 
preamble statement. No comments 
received in response to the November 
27, 1991, proposed rule on nutrition 
labeling stated that significant 
participation should be based on the 
volume of product covered and the 
number of shoppers given access to this 
information. 
In addition, as FSIS explained in the 
preamble to its final nutrition labeling 
regulations in 1993, it is important to 
provide nutrition information to 
consumers and, to the extent possible, 
to harmonize with FDA’s voluntary 
program for raw fruit, raw vegetables, 
and raw fish (58 FR 640, January 6, 
1993). Consistent with FSIS’s 
regulations, FDA’s regulations provide 
that substantial compliance exists with 
the guidelines for the voluntary 
nutrition labeling for raw fruits, 
vegetables, and fish when at least 60 
percent of all stores that are evaluated 
are in compliance (21 CFR 101.43(c)). 
The 1995 survey found that 66.5% of 
stores were participating in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program; 
the 1996 survey found that 57.5% of 
stores were participating; and the 1999 
survey found that 54.5% of stores were 
participating. Based on the regulations, 
stores were found to be participating in 
the voluntary nutrition labeling program 
if they provided nutrition information 
for 90% of the major cuts in their stores. 
FSIS recognizes that, given a variance 
factor of plus or minus 4%, store 
participation could have been 70.5% in 
1995, 61.5% in 1996, and 58.5% in 
1999. However, even assuming a plus 
4% margin of error, the 1999 survey 
showed that significant participation 
did not exist. Furthermore, given a

variance factor of 4%, store 
participation also could have been 
62.5% in 1995, 53.7% in 1996, and 
50.8% in 1999. Significantly, the 1999 
participation rate was lower than the 
1996 participation rate. As a result, FSIS 
concluded that it had an obligation 
under its regulations to institute this 
rulemaking. The Agency did not survey 
again after 1999. 
Consistent with the regulations, the 
surveys assessed whether stores 
provided nutrition information for 90% 
of major cuts stocked in their stores 
(§ 317.343(b) and § 381.443.(b)). In 
addition, the surveys assessed whether 
stores provided nutrition information 
for a lower percentage of such products. 
The 1996 survey found that 59.4% of 
stores provided nutrition information, 
according to voluntary guidelines, for 
70% to 90% or more of their major cuts. 
Thus, based on the 1996 survey, even if 
FSIS includes stores that provided 
nutrition information according to the 
voluntary guidelines for only 70% of 
their major cuts, this percentage of 
stores is not quite 60% and, thus, still 
does not meet the ‘‘significant 
participation’’ criteria in the regulations. 
In the 1999 survey, 58.3% of stores 
provided nutrition information, 
according to the voluntary guidelines, 
for 50% to 90% or more of their major 
cuts. Again, this percentage of stores is 
still not quite 60% and does not meet 
the ‘‘significant participation’’ criteria in 
the regulations. Based on the 1999 
survey, even if FSIS includes stores that 
provided nutrition information 
according to the voluntary guidelines 
for only 50% of their major cuts, FSIS 
still would not find 60% participation. 
(See Table 7 of the surveys on the FSIS 
Web site: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/
Frame/FrameRedirect.asp?main=http://
www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/
FRPubs/Docs_98-005P.htm). 
Comment: One retail industry 
association stated that, unamended by a 
legislative vehicle comparable to the 
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, 
the meat and poultry Acts do not give 
USDA the statutory authority to 
mandate nutrition labeling regulations 
for single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products. 
Response: FSIS believes that without 
nutrition information, the labeling of 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products fails to 
include material facts about the 
consequences of consuming these 
products. This information is necessary 
for consumers to have if they are to 
make educated choices that are 
necessary in structuring a healthy diet. 
FSIS has concluded that the lack of this 
information on the labeling of the major 
cuts causes the labeling of these 
products to be misleading. The FMIA 
and PPIA provide that a product is 
misbranded if its labeling is false or 
misleading in any particular (21 U.S.C. 
601(n)(1) and 453(h)(1)). Without the 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products that 
would be provided if significant 
participation in the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program existed, the Agency 
has concluded that these products 
would be misbranded under the FMIA 
and the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1) and 
453 (h)(1)). 
Mandatory Nutrition Labeling for 
Ground or Chopped Products 
Comment: Many individuals, 
consumer organizations, and nutrition 
organizations supported mandatory 
nutrition labeling on the package for 
ground or chopped products. Several 
industry associations also supported 
these requirements and stated that these 
requirements were feasible and 
reasonable. One of these associations 
also stated that because ground meat 
products are formulated to have greater 
consistency and uniformity in their 
composition than other cuts, retailers 
can create a standard, on-package label 
that provides accurate, reliable nutrition 
information. 
Consumer groups noted that several 
supermarket chains already include full 
nutrition facts labels on their ground 
beef products. These commenters 
believed that required nutrition labels 
for ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products would create the most 
informative and clear information for 
consumers. 
Consumer and industry commenters 
stated that consumers cannot visually 
detect the fat content of ground beef 
products, and without on-package 
labeling, consumers cannot easily 
determine what nutrition information 
provided on point-of-purchase materials 
would apply to individual packages of 
ground products. However, one of the 
industry commenters that supported on- 
package nutrition labeling had concerns 
regarding the economic impact of this 
labeling. 
Most industry trade associations and 
grocer associations did not support on- 
package nutrition labeling information 
for ground or chopped products. One 
industry association stated that the 
FMIA and PPIA do not support on-pack 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
products. Another industry association 
stated that consumer education 
regarding the nutritional qualities of 
meat and poultry products, in 
conjunction with mandatory point-of- 
purchase labeling, would provide 
consumers with sufficient information 
for ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products. Similarly, a third industry 
association supported mandatory 
nutrition labeling for ground or chopped 
products, provided it could be provided 
at their point-of-purchase. 
Industry commenters stated that there 
is not room on the label of ground 
products for a nutrition facts panel. Two 
commenters stated that nutrition labels 
for ground or chopped products should 
be exempt from the current type size 
requirements or the labels will be too 
large; alternatively, these commenters 
suggested that FSIS should allow use of 
the linear label format. 
Two industry commenters stated that 
results from surveys conducted in 
March 2001 indicated that the majority 
of their members routinely test for fat in 
ground beef. However, they believe that 
few retailers can determine nutrient or 
fat content of ground product blended at 
the store. Similarly, several other 
industry commenters stated that few 
retailers have, or could afford, 
equipment to determine the nutritional 
content, including fat, for the products 
they grind. Therefore, according to these 
commenters, mandating nutrition 
information on labeling may constrain 
small operations, limit the variety of 
ground products, and dissuade the 
practice of grinding at the request of the 
customer. An individual also stated that 
the proposed requirements for ground or 
chopped products would not be feasible 
for small grocers. 
One retail industry association stated 
that, although retailers can readily 
measure the fat content of ground 
product, establishing the exact nutrient 
profiles on a daily basis would not be 
feasible. According to this commenter, if 
products were analyzed, they would no 
longer be salable by the time analytical 
results became available. Another retail 
industry association stated that some 
retail stores have access to fat content by 
using a fat analyzer when doing in-store 
grinding of meat or poultry products; 
however, testing for additional nutrient 
content would require the use of a 
laboratory and would prove costly. 
Another industry commenter stated that 
large, centrally processed ground 
products can be formulated to precise 
fat contents, but many ground products 
produced in retail settings cannot. 
Two industry associations supported 
the required nutrition labels on ground 
or chopped products that are ‘‘case- 
ready’’ but not for products prepared 
and packaged at retail. Like other 
industry commenters summarized 
above, these commenters stated that 
retailers do not have the equipment

67750 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
necessary to determine the finished 
product’s nutrient content. 
Two associations stated that most 
consumers purchase ground products 
based on percent lean, the cut, or the 
cost of product, rather than based on the 
other nutrient content information. 
Another association stated that 
according to survey data, 45% of 
consumers choose ground beef based on 
price, 23% based on cut, and 9% based 
on fat content. 
Response: Should this rule become 
final, FSIS will require on-package 
nutrition information for these products 
rather than allowing nutrition 
information to be provided at their 
point-of-purchase for the reasons stated 
in the proposed rule. Because there are 
numerous formulations of ground or 
chopped products, it would be difficult 
for producers or retailers to develop 
point-of-purchase materials that would 
address all the different formulations 
that exist for these products. 
Furthermore, it would be difficult for 
consumers to find the correct 
information for a specific ground or 
chopped product on point-of-purchase 
materials that include information 
concerning numerous formulations of 
these products (66 FR 4977, January 18, 
2001). If a statement of the fat 
percentage and lean percentage is not 
included on a package of ground 
product, consumers would not know 
which nutrient data concerning ground 
product on point-of-purchase materials 
would apply to that particular ground 
product. Establishments and retailers 
are not currently required to provide 
such a statement and will not be 
required to provide such a statement 
when this rule becomes effective. 
The FMIA and PPIA do support on- 
package nutrition labels for ground or 
chopped products. The FMIA and PPIA 
provide that a product is misbranded if 
its labeling is false or misleading in any 
particular. FSIS has concluded that 
ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products that do not bear nutrition 
information would be misbranded 
under 21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1) and 453(h)(1). 
Information concerning the nutritional 
qualities of ground or chopped meat and 
poultry products is particularly 
important because these products, 
especially ground beef, are widely 
consumed. Pertinent nutritional 
information is integral to consumer 
purchase decisions because use of this 
information may result in the 
prevention of health problems and the 
reduction of health risks for some 
consumers. Additional information 
about the nutrient values of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products 
would enable consumers to make 
informed decisions about including 
these products in their diets and will, 
therefore, help consumers to construct 
healthy diets. 
Thus, consistent with the 
recommendations from individuals, 
consumer organizations, and some 
industry comments, should it become 
final, this rule will require nutrition 
labels on all ground or chopped meat 
and poultry products, with or without 
added seasonings, unless an exemption 
applies. The rule will also require 
nutrition labels on packages of single- 
ingredient, raw ground or chopped 
products, rather than at their point-of- 
purchase. These products are similar to 
multi-ingredient products in the 
mandatory nutrition labeling program 
(which requires nutrition information to 
be on the label of individual packages). 
Just as producers can control the 
incoming ingredients and levels of such 
ingredients in multi-ingredient 
products, producers can precisely 
control the fat content of ground or 
chopped products to obtain the desired 
product. In addition, just as consumers 
cannot often see all the ingredients in 
multi-ingredient products, consumers 
cannot easily see the fat in ground or 
chopped products. The fat is uniformly 
distributed throughout the product and 
is not clearly distinguishable on the 
surface of the product. Therefore, 
consumers cannot estimate the fat levels 
in these products and cannot compare 
the fat levels in these products to those 
in other products. Thus, it is difficult for 
consumers to have a reasonable 
expectation of the nutritional quality of 
these products. 
Many grocers and manufacturers 
currently provide nutrition facts panels 
on ground beef products; therefore, FSIS 
questions why certain commenters 
stated that there is not sufficient room 
on the label of these products for 
nutrition information. In addition, FSIS 
continues to believe that, unlike other 
single-ingredient, raw products, 
producers are able to formulate 
precisely the fat content of ground or 
chopped products. If, as some 
commenters suggested, grocers cannot 
determine the fat percentage in ground 
or chopped beef produced at retail, FSIS 
questions how they can be certain they 
produce product that meets the standard 
of identity for ground or chopped beef, 
which requires that the product not 
exceed 30 percent fat (see § 319.15). 
Information on ground beef products 
containing 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 
25% fat is available through ARS at the 
following Internet address: http:// 
www.ars.usda.gov\nutrientdata. In 
addition, ARS has included a calculator 
on the Internet, with the Database, that 
allows parties to enter the amount of fat 
(5% to 30% fat) or lean (70% to 95% 
lean) in a raw ground beef product. The 
calculator will calculate the nutrient 
values for the product based on the fat 
or lean value entered. If retailers are 
able to determine the fat content, as two 
industry commenters suggested they 
could, they can use the ARS nutrient 
database to obtain the information 
necessary to help them determine other 
nutrient values in the product. 
Additionally, the nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products should not be particularly 
difficult for small operations, since 
ground or chopped product produced 
by retail establishments and Federal 
establishments that meet specific small 
business criteria will be exempt from 
nutrition labeling requirements 
(§§ 317.400(a)(1) and 381.500(a)(1)). 
Moreover, a new exemption from the 
nutrition labeling requirements, that is 
provided in this supplemental proposed 
rule, should alleviate any concerns that 
nutrition labeling requirements will 
discourage retailers from grinding 
product based on customers’ requests. 
Should it become final, the rule will 
provide an exemption from nutrition 
labeling requirements for ground or 
chopped products that are ground or 
chopped at an individual customer’s 
request and that are prepared and 
served or sold at retail, provided that 
the labels or labeling of these products 
bear no nutrition claims or nutrition 
information. 
If an individual customer selects an 
intact product for purchase and requests 
that the product be ground at the retail 
facility, FSIS has determined that 
nutrition information on the package of 
the ground product would not be 
necessary. In this instance, the customer 
has made the decision to purchase the 
product before it was ground. The 
customer is not selecting the product 
from among various, formulated, ground 
or chopped product, and thus the 
reasons for requiring a nutrition label on 
such a product would not be applicable 
here. 
Comment: One animal protection 
organization stated that the nutrition 
information should be presented on an 
‘‘as packaged’’ basis for ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products, 
and that ‘‘as consumed’’ information 
should be in addition to, not instead of, 
‘‘as packaged’’ information. No 
commenters suggested that ‘‘as 
consumed’’ information alone was 
adequate. 
Response: FSIS agrees with the 
commenter. Should it become final, the 
rule will require, as proposed, that 
nutrition information on the labels of

ground or chopped products be 
presented on an ‘‘as packaged’’ or ‘‘raw’’ 
basis. Although not required, a second 
column can be added to show nutrition 
information on the product on an ‘‘as 
consumed’’ or ‘‘cooked’’ basis. The 
regulations provide that if a product is 
commonly combined with other 
ingredients or cooked before eating, and 
directions for such combinations or 
preparations are provided, another 
column with nutrition information may 
be used (9 CFR §§ 317.309(b)(15) and (e) 
and 381.409(b)(15) and (e). Therefore, 
the nutrition information required on 
packages of ground or chopped products 
will be consistent with the information 
required on multi-ingredient and heat 
processed products. FSIS requests 
further comment on this issue. 
Comment: FSIS did not receive any 
comments on how much meat derived 
from advanced meat/bone separation 
and recovery (AMR) systems or how 
much low temperature rendered 
product is currently being used in 
ground or chopped products. However, 
an industry organization stated that the 
use of product from AMR systems in 
ground beef products would not cause 
a dramatic change in the nutrient 
content of the product such that it 
would be misleading to consumers. The 
commenter noted that, based on the data 
FSIS presented (see 66 FR 4976, January 
18, 2001), the level of cholesterol in 
product containing meat from AMR 
systems is slightly elevated, and the 
level of iron in the product is above 20 
percent of the value of iron product not 
containing meat from AMR systems. 
However, according to the commenter, 
the studies were not performed in a 
compliance context, and FSIS did not 
provide information concerning the 
historical levels of iron or other 
information that would shed light on 
whether the difference accords with 
good manufacturing practices. 
Response: FSIS presented information 
concerning ground beef with AMR 
product for illustrative purposes only. 
The data show an increase in the level 
of calcium over what would occur if 
good manufacturing practices were 
used. Similarly, iron levels in ground 
beef that includes AMR product may be 
higher than those in ground beef that 
does not include AMR product. 
In meetings with FSIS, representatives 
of the meat industry have stated that the 
percentage of ground beef with AMR 
product and the level of AMR product 
in ground beef is higher than FSIS 
previously thought. FSIS continues to 
believe that one of the reasons nutrition 
information on the labels of ground or 
chopped meat products is important is 
because producers may use product 
from AMR systems in some of these 
products, and the use of AMR product 
can affect the nutrient values of these 
products. Finally, even though FSIS 
issued an interim final rule on AMR that 
provides specific restrictions on the 
levels of calcium and iron in AMR 
product (69 FR 1874, January 12, 2004), 
nutrition labeling of ground products 
that may contain AMR product is 
necessary to understand the nutritional 
profile of the food. 
Comment: FSIS received few 
comments regarding consumer 
expectations of the fat content of ground 
products. One industry commenter 
stated that consumers do not have 
reasonable expectations of the nutrient 
content of ground products given the 
wide variation of fat and lean content. 
Response: FSIS agrees that consumers 
do not have reasonable expectations of 
the nutrient content of ground or 
chopped products. Unlike whole muscle 
product, most consumers cannot 
visually discern which ground or 
chopped products have less fat, and 
which products have more fat, because 
the fat is ground in with the lean 
portion. In addition, producers may use 
meat from AMR systems and low 
temperature rendering in ground or 
chopped beef and pork products, which 
may affect the variability of these 
products. 
No Requirements for Nonmajor Cuts 
Comment: Several industry groups 
supported the proposal not to require 
nutrition labeling on nonmajor cuts that 
are not ground or chopped (e.g., pork 
jowls, pigs feet, pork leg, pork shoulder 
picnic, and beef round rump) and did 
not believe such labeling was needed in 
the future. Two industry commenters 
stated that when grades and trim levels 
are considered, there are over 3300 cuts 
of red meat products, and it would be 
impossible to provide information on 
this number of products. 
One industry group also indicated 
that the major cuts identified by the 
nutrition labeling regulations are still 
relevant today as representing the 
greatest share of fresh meat 
consumption, thus suggesting that it is 
more important that nutrition 
information be provided for these 
products than for the nonmajor cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw products. 
As discussed above, the majority of 
comments from individuals, consumer 
groups, and health organizations stated 
that FSIS should require on-package 
nutrition labeling for all single 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products (major and nonmajor cuts). An 
animal protection organization 
recommended that FSIS take no more 
than 24 months to investigate whether 
required nutrition labeling for single- 
ingredient, nonmajor cuts that are not 
ground or chopped is warranted. 
Response: At this time, FSIS does not 
intend to require that nutrition 
information be provided for nonmajor 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw products 
that are not ground or chopped. FSIS 
has determined that it is not appropriate 
or necessary to require nutrition 
information for nonmajor cuts that are 
not ground or chopped at this time. 
They do not contribute in a major way 
to the diet. FSIS stated in the proposed 
rule that it intended to examine the 
current state of nutrition labeling for 
single-ingredient, raw products that are 
not ground or chopped and that are not 
major cuts (66 FR 4974, January 18, 
2001). FSIS still intends to conduct this 
assessment but has not yet been able to 
do so because of competing priorities. 
Should this rule become effective, FSIS 
will examine and assess the adequacy of 
the nutrition information provided for 
the major cuts and will also determine 
whether sufficient nutrition information 
is being made available for the nonmajor 
cuts. 
Permitting Percent Lean Statements on 
Labels or in Labeling of Ground or 
Chopped Products 
Comment: Individuals and consumer 
and nutrition organizations generally 
did not support the use of statements of 
lean percentages on the label or in 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
that do not meet the regulatory criteria 
for ‘‘low fat.’’ A coalition of consumer 
and health and nutrition organizations 
stated that permitting such claims on 
packages of ground meat and poultry is 
inherently deceptive and will confuse 
consumers about the healthfulness of 
fresh ground meat and poultry products 
compared to other fresh meat, processed 
meat, and other foods. This coalition 
and an individual stated that a 
statement of fat percentage without a 
statement of lean percentage would be 
an effective means of allowing 
consumer comparison of ground 
products. Similarly, a medical school 
stated that, instead of a statement of 
‘‘lean’’ on ground or chopped products, 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
should list the actual amount of fat in 
terms of ‘‘x% fat or less.’’ 
One medical organization suggested 
that instead of a statement of lean 
percentage as a quick reference, FSIS 
should allow a ‘‘percent calories from 
fat’’ statement on labeling of ground or 
chopped products. According to this 
commenter, this statement would allow 
comparisons among ground products 
and would also allow a comparison of

the amount of fat in the product to the 
daily amount of fat recommended in 
USDA dietary guidelines and the daily 
amount of fat recommended by other 
health associations. 
One animal protection organization 
suggested that the use of percent lean 
statements is highly misleading since 
‘‘percent lean’’ refers to percent by 
weight not percent of calories. 
As a better means to compare ground 
products than a statement of the 
percentage fat and percentage lean in 
the product, one consumer organization 
noted that many packages of ground 
meat or poultry would meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘reduced fat,’’ 
‘‘light,’’ and ‘‘lower fat’’ nutrient content 
claims. This organization stated that 
such claims are now familiar to 
consumers, and that the use of such 
claims would ensure uniformity across 
product categories and reduce consumer 
confusion. 
In contrast, an industry association 
did not support ‘‘reduced fat’’ labeling 
on ground products because, according 
to the commenter, it would penalize 
retailers who offer only the leanest 
products and do not offer those with 
higher fat content. In addition, the 
commenter believed that ‘‘reduced fat’’ 
labeling would be confusing to 
consumers who understand and have 
come to rely on the percentage fat and 
lean statements that are currently in use. 
Two poultry industry associations did 
not support the provision for statements 
of lean percentages on ground or 
chopped products that do not meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat.’’ These 
associations stated that allowing the use 
of a statement of lean percentage on 
ground product that does not meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat’’ would 
be misleading, and that there is no basis 
for exempting ground product from the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat’’ that 
normally applies to product labeled 
‘‘lean’’ (see §§ 317.362(e)(1) and (2) and 
381.462(e)(1) and (2)). 
The majority of industry associations 
supported the use of a statement of lean 
percentage on the label or in labeling of 
ground products that do not meet the 
regulatory criteria for ‘‘low fat.’’ They 
believed that the statement of lean 
percentage on ground beef products is 
not misleading and is a useful tool for 
consumers. Several commenters 
discussed telephone surveys whose 
findings indicated that the statement of 
lean percentage does not mislead 
consumers. The commenters stated that 
these surveys indicated that many 
consumers use the statements of lean 
and fat percentages as a basis for 
selecting ground beef products, and that 
most consumers understand that the 
statement of fat percentage indicates the 
percentage of fat in the product, not the 
grams of fat, percent Daily Value, or 
percent of calories from fat. Several 
industry associations stated that the 
percent lean and percent fat statements, 
in combination with the nutrition facts 
panel, will benefit consumers and allow 
consumers to quickly differentiate 
among ground products and determine 
how a serving of ground product fits 
into their overall diet. 
One industry group recommended 
that FSIS consider allowing retailers to 
make a statement such as ‘‘not more 
than 25% fat’’ for a 75% lean/25% fat 
ground beef product, and one industry 
commenter recommended a tolerance 
for percentage content statements 
comparable to the tolerance allowed for 
nutrient value variations. 
Response: The supplemental 
proposed regulations would permit a 
statement of lean percentage on the 
label or in labeling of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products that 
do not meet the regulatory criteria for 
‘‘low fat.’’ The regulations would 
require that a statement of fat percentage 
be contiguous to, in lettering of the same 
color, size, and type as, and on the same 
color background as, the statement of 
lean percentage. 
Although individuals, consumer 
commenters and nutrition organizations 
generally did not support this provision, 
most industry commenters did. Industry 
commenters presented information from 
consumer surveys that showed that 
consumers understood the meaning of 
statements of lean and fat percentages 
on ground beef. Based on the survey 
information provided, interested 
consumers use this information as a 
quick way to compare ground beef 
products and as a means for ensuring 
the desired product is purchased. 
Additionally, based on the survey 
information discussed in the comments, 
consumers appear to understand that 
the percent lean statements simply 
indicate the percentage of lean versus 
fat in the products and do not interpret 
the information as a percent daily value 
(%DV) or percent of calories from fat in 
the product. 
Producers, according to industry, 
have been using lean percentage 
statements on the labeling of ground 
beef and hamburger products for over 20 
years (59 FR 26917, May 24, 1994). 
Because the percent fat statement must 
be contiguous to the percent lean 
statement and must be in lettering of the 
same color, size, and type as, and on the 
same color background as, the lean 
percentage statement, FSIS believes that 
the percent lean statements will not 
mislead consumers. 
As the coalition and individual 
commenter suggested, producers may 
include a percent fat statement on the 
label or in labeling of ground products 
without including a percent lean 
statement, because a percent fat 
statement is factual information. A 
percent fat statement on ground or 
chopped products would be an 
acceptable alternative to a statement of 
lean and fat percentage. However, 
because of the longstanding use of the 
statements of percent fat and percent 
lean on the label or in labeling of 
ground beef and hamburger products, 
FSIS believes such statements on the 
label or in labeling of ground products 
will not mislead consumers. 
As the consumer organization noted, 
ground or chopped products may meet 
the regulatory criteria for ‘‘reduced fat’’ 
or for ‘‘light.’’ The provisions for the 
statement of percent fat and percent 
lean in ground or chopped products will 
not preclude producers from using 
‘‘reduced fat,’’ ‘‘light,’’ and other 
nutrient content claims. 
In response to the suggestion that 
FSIS allow a ‘‘percent calories from fat,’’ 
FSIS already allows such a statement 
because it is factual information. 
The current regulations do not 
preclude the use of the phrases ‘‘x% fat 
or less’’ or ‘‘not more than x% fat’’ on 
the labeling of ground or chopped 
product. The problem with the 
suggested alternative of listing the 
actual amount of fat in terms of ‘‘x% fat 
or less’’ or allowing statements such as 
‘‘not more than 25% fat,’’ is that these 
statements are implied claims as 
defined by § 317.369 for red meat and 
§ 381.469 for poultry products. In order 
to use the implied claim, ground 
products would need to meet one of the 
definitions for a nutrient content claim 
for fat content in § 317.362(b)(2) or (4) 
or § 381.462(b)(2) or (4). According to 
these regulations, to use such phrases, 
the product would have to be ‘‘low fat,’’ 
and most ground beef and hamburger do 
not qualify as ‘‘low fat.’’ Alternatively, 
the product would have to qualify as 
having ‘‘reduced fat’’ and would need to 
meet a 25% reduction in fat compared 
to a similar product. 
Finally, in response to the industry 
suggestion that FSIS provide a tolerance 
for percentage content statements 
comparable to the tolerance allowed for 
nutrient value variations, the same 
tolerances allowed for nutrient value 
variations (317.309(h)(5) and (6) and 
381.409(h)(5) and (6)) would apply to 
the statements of the percentages of lean 
and fat in the product, because these 
statements are based on information in 
the nutrition facts panel.

67753 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Exemptions for Nutrition Labeling 
Comment: Two industry organizations 
stated that there should be a small 
business exemption from the nutrition 
labeling requirements for the major cuts. 
They argued that the Agency’s stated 
rationale for not providing a small 
business exemption for these products 
(i.e., that FSIS intends to make point-of- 
purchase materials available over the 
Internet free of charge) shows a lack of 
understanding of the challenges faced 
by small businesses and the economic 
hardships that the regulation imposes. 
These commenters stated that many 
small businesses do not have Internet 
access. Additionally, according to these 
commenters, small stores may not have 
space available to post the point-of- 
purchase materials. 
Response: If retailers cannot obtain 
the point-of-purchase materials over the 
Internet, should this rule become final, 
FSIS personnel will have copies of the 
information to provide to retailers. 
Furthermore, the regulations will 
provide flexibility in regard to the 
manner in which the required 
presentation and posting of nutrition 
information for the major cuts must be 
done, so that all retailers should be able 
to post the information or have it 
available to consumers without using 
much space. For example, posters with 
nutrition information could be on walls 
near the products, or brochures or 
leaflets could be placed in a box near 
the products. 
Comment: One animal protection 
organization did not support the small 
business exemption from nutrition 
labeling requirements for ground or 
chopped products. This commenter 
stated that the exemption could create a 
significant information gap in small 
towns and rural areas where large chain 
retail and grocery stores do not have a 
presence. Similarly, an individual stated 
that there should be no exemptions from 
the nutrition labeling requirements. 
One industry group stated that ground 
or chopped products with or without 
seasonings, processed or packaged at 
retail must continue to be exempt from 
nutrition labeling requirements. This 
commenter stated that the quantity of 
ground products actually prepared at 
retail represents a small portion of the 
average diet. 
Two industry commenters stated that 
FSIS should allow an exemption for 
ground or chopped products that are 
custom processed. They stated that 
when a retailer is only providing a 
service, not a food product, the retailer 
should not be expected to bear the cost 
of providing nutrition information, 
especially in rural areas where families 
raise their own animals and have a local 
meat market or supermarket provide the 
cutting and grinding service. 
Response: FSIS believes that a small 
business exemption from nutrition 
labeling requirements is necessary for 
ground products, with or without 
seasoning. As explained in the proposed 
rule, small businesses should be exempt 
from mandatory nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products because these requirements 
would create undue economic hardship 
for small businesses and would create 
disincentives for these small businesses 
to develop more nutritious food 
products (66 FR 4978, January 18, 2001). 
Therefore, should this rule become 
final, it will provide a small business 
exemption for ground or chopped 
products produced by retail facilities or 
official establishments that qualify for 
the exemption. 
Should this rule become final, to 
qualify for the exemption, a retail store 
will either need to be a single retail 
store that employs 500 or fewer people 
or a multi-retail store operation that 
employs 500 or fewer people and will 
need to produce no more than 100,000 
pounds of each ground product per 
year. For an official establishment to 
qualify for the exemption, it will need 
to be either a single-plant facility that 
employs 500 or fewer people, or a multi- 
plant company/firm that employs 500 or 
fewer people and will need to produce 
no more than 100,000 pounds per year 
of each ground product. As explained in 
the preamble to the proposed rule, 
ground or chopped products formulated 
to have different levels of fat would be 
considered different food products for 
the purposes of the small business 
exemption (66 FR 4978, January 18, 
2001). 
Should this rule become final, ready- 
to-eat ground or chopped products 
packaged or portioned at retail stores 
and similar retail-type establishments, 
and multi-ingredient ground or chopped 
products processed at retail stores and 
similar retail-type establishments, will 
be required to bear nutrition labels, 
unless the retail store or similar retail- 
type establishment qualifies for the 
small business exemption. Because a 
significant amount of ground beef is 
processed at retail, the Agency believes 
that there may be a significant amount 
of multi-ingredient ground beef retail 
processed products or ready-to-eat retail 
packaged products. 
The Economics Research Service 
determined that ground beef accounted 
for 42 percent of all beef (boneless, 
trimmed-weight equivalent) consumed 
in 1996 (Putnam, Judy and Gerrior, 
Shirly, ‘‘Americans Consuming More 
Grains and Vegetables, Less Saturated 
Fat, Food Review, Sept.–Dec., 1997, Vol. 
20, Issue 3, pp. 2–12), and, as explained 
in the preamble to the proposed rule, 
most ground beef, traditionally, has 
been ground and packaged at retail (66 
FR 4978, January 18, 2001). Therefore, 
ground beef products actually prepared 
at retail may represent a significant 
portion of beef consumed in the average 
diet. 
When butchers custom grind product 
for customers, this product is 
considered a custom prepared product, 
and as such, this product will continue 
to qualify for an exemption from 
nutrition labeling requirements, should 
this rule become final. 
Comment: One retail association and 
one consultant believed that the small 
business exemption for ground or 
chopped products should be phased in, 
in a manner similar to the way the small 
business exemption was phased in for 
nutrition labeling requirements in the 
1993 FSIS final rule on nutrition 
labeling. 
Response: FSIS disagrees with these 
commenters. Should this rule become 
final, the nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
meat and poultry products will apply to 
a much smaller number of products 
than the number of products subject to 
the 1993 final regulations on nutrition 
labeling. At this time, many businesses 
are familiar with nutrition labeling 
requirements; that was not the case in 
1993. Therefore, as explained in the 
supplemental PRIA cost analysis, FSIS 
believes that it will not be costly for 
companies to add nutrition labels to 
packages of ground or chopped 
products. 
Furthermore, many of the suppliers of 
coarse ground products that are then 
ground and packaged at retail have 
supplied, or can supply, the nutrition 
facts panels for the retailers. Most 
retailers offer a limited selection of 
ground beef products. Thus, dozens of 
different nutrition labels for each 
retailer will not be necessary. In 
addition, information for ground beef 
and other products is available through 
the National Nutrient Database for 
Standard Reference. In addition, should 
this rule become effective, the 
requirements for on-package nutrition 
labeling for ground or chopped products 
will not be effective until January 1, 
2012. 
Comment: Two industry commenters 
supported the continued exemption for 
multi-ingredient sausage products 
produced at retail. They stated that 
retail constraints in determining 
nutrient content support the 
continuation of the exemption. One

67754 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
commenter asserted that the final 
regulation should specify that the 
provisions for ground or chopped 
products apply to product labeled as 
‘‘hamburger, (species or kind) burger or 
ground or chopped (species or kind)’’ in 
order to differentiate such products 
from sausage products (ground meat 
with seasonings). This commenter 
stated that some parties might believe 
that the provisions for ground product 
apply to sausage products manufactured 
at retail. 
Response: Nutrition information for 
sausage products are not covered by this 
regulation. Nutrition labeling 
requirements for these products were 
previously addressed in the 1993 
nutrition labeling rule. Sausage, meat 
loaf, or beef patty mix are typically 
multi-ingredient products that are 
required to bear nutrition labeling, 
unless they qualify for an exemption, 
and multi-ingredient sausage products 
processed at retail will continue to be 
exempt from nutrition labeling 
requirements under § 317.400(a)(7)(ii) 
and § 381.500(b)(7)(ii). Because there is 
a standard of composition for ground or 
chopped beef (§ 319.15) and distinct 
standards of identity for sausage 
products, industry generally 
understands which products are 
referred to and labeled ‘‘ground or 
chopped products’’ and which products 
are referred to and labeled ‘‘sausage 
products.’’ 
In the 1993 final rule on nutrition 
labeling, FSIS exempted from 
mandatory nutrition labeling 
requirements multi-ingredient products 
processed at retail and ready-to-eat 
products packaged or portioned at retail. 
Therefore, multi-ingredient sausages 
processed at retail and ready-to-eat 
sausages packaged or portioned at retail 
are exempt from nutrition labeling 
requirements. The reasons that FSIS 
provided these exemptions in the 1993 
final rule were that FSIS believed that 
it would be impractical to enforce 
nutrition labeling requirements on these 
products prepared or served at retail 
and because the Agency concluded, 
based on a review of National Food 
Consumption Survey (NFCS) data, that 
the average person’s diet consisted of an 
insignificant proportion of ready-to-eat 
retail packaged products or retail 
processed products (58 FR 639, January 
6, 1993). 
Should this rule become final, FSIS 
will not exempt ready-to-eat ground or 
chopped products packaged or 
portioned at retail or multi-ingredient 
ground or chopped products that are 
processed at retail because, as FSIS 
explained in the 2001 nutrition labeling 
proposed rule, there may be a 
significant amount of multi-ingredient 
ground beef retail processed products or 
ready-to-eat retail packaged products. 
Also, FSIS no longer believes 
enforcement of nutrition labeling 
requirements at retail stores to be 
impractical because FSIS is already 
conducting testing for Escherichia coli 
O157:H7 at retail (66 FR 4979, January 
18, 2001). 
Enforcement & Compliance 
Comment: One retail association 
stated that FSIS should include in the 
regulations provisions comparable to 
those in the Nutrition and Labeling 
Education Act (NLEA) such that 
retailers would not be subject to 
substantial civil and criminal penalties 
for violations of the nutrition labeling 
requirements. This commenter was 
concerned that, if the USDA requires 
nutrition labeling for the major cuts, 
retailers could be penalized for minor 
violations of these regulations. For 
example, the commenter suggested that 
if a poster providing nutrition labeling 
information falls down, the retailer 
could suffer substantial penalties. 
This commenter also asserted that, 
with regard to FSIS product sampling 
and nutrient analysis, FSIS should 
continue to treat single-ingredient, raw 
ground products in the same manner it 
treats other single-ingredient, raw 
products. Therefore, the commenter 
stated, FSIS should not sample raw, 
ground products for which USDA data 
are used as the basis for the nutrition 
information on the label. Further, the 
commenter stated that if FSIS conducts 
sampling of ground products at retail for 
nutrient analysis, the ground products 
should only be analyzed for fat content. 
According to this commenter, once FSIS 
verifies the fat content of ground 
products, products labeled with 
corresponding USDA data values should 
not be subject to further compliance and 
enforcement. 
An animal protection organization 
stated that ground products should be 
subject to nutrient analysis. This 
commenter stated that the USDA 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference includes only a limited 
number of ground products, and there 
are many others available on the market. 
According to this commenter, FSIS 
employees cannot, and should not be 
expected to, visually assess the product 
and compare it against its label. 
Response: Products under FSIS 
jurisdiction are not subject to the NLEA. 
Nonetheless, FSIS does not consider it 
likely that substantial criminal penalties 
could be imposed for significant 
violations of the nutrition labeling 
requirements. FSIS stated in the 
preamble to the final January 6, 1993, 
nutrition labeling rule that it is not the 
Agency’s intent to proceed in a punitive 
manner when problems surface during 
compliance monitoring (58 FR 657, 
January 6, 1993). Should this rule 
become final, FSIS will likely seek 
criminal penalties for violations of the 
nutrition labeling requirements in the 
same types of circumstances as it would 
for other labeling violations of the FMIA 
and PPIA. Consistent with its approach 
to enforcing existing nutrition labeling 
requirements, under this rule, if FSIS 
finds nutrition information on product 
labels that, based on FSIS or USDA data, 
is inaccurate, FSIS would contact the 
company and request that it either 
correct the information on the label or 
provide adequate justification to 
support the information. If the company 
failed to do so, FSIS would likely issue 
a letter of warning. 
FSIS is authorized to issue letters of 
warning in lieu of seeking criminal 
penalties when the Secretary of 
Agriculture determines the public 
interest will be adequately served by a 
letter of warning. If the company 
continued to use the inaccurate label, 
FSIS could institute an administrative 
process to rescind the label approval 
under 9 CFR § 500.8 and could seize any 
product in commerce because it is 
misbranded. However, FSIS considers it 
highly unlikely that companies will 
continue to use inaccurate labels after 
FSIS has contacted them because 
introducing misbranded product in 
commerce is a prohibited act under 21 
U.S.C. 610 and 458. FSIS is not 
authorized to impose civil penalties 
under the FMIA or PPIA. 
With regard to FSIS product sampling 
and nutrient analysis of ground 
products, as FSIS stated in the preamble 
to the proposal, the fat content of 
different ground or chopped products 
can vary significantly, depending upon 
the level of fat in the product being 
ground and depending on whether 
product from AMR systems is used (66 
FR 4980, January 18, 2001). Therefore, 
the procedures set forth for FSIS 
product sampling and nutrient analysis 
in §§ 317.309(h)(1)–(8) and 
381.409(h)(1)–(8) would be applicable to 
ground or chopped meat and to ground 
or chopped poultry products, 
respectively. Should this rule become 
final, FSIS will not analyze ground or 
chopped products for fat only, because 
if the ground product includes AMR 
product or product from low 
temperature rendering (e.g., finely 
textured beef or lean finely textured 
beef), the use of these materials could 
affect the nutrient values in the product.

67755 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
With regard to FSIS product sampling 
and nutrient analysis, FSIS will not treat 
single-ingredient, raw ground or 
chopped products in the same manner 
that it treats other single-ingredient, raw 
products primarily because, as 
explained in the proposed rule, FSIS 
program employees cannot visually 
assess whether nutrition information on 
the label of ground or chopped products 
accurately reflects the labeled products’ 
content. In most cases, it is not possible 
to visually assess the level of fat in a 
ground product. For example, FSIS 
program employees cannot visually 
determine whether product that is 
labeled 17 percent fat ground beef is 
actually 17 percent fat ground beef as 
opposed to 27 percent fat (or another 
percentage of fat) ground beef (66 FR 
4980, January 18, 2001). Therefore, 
should this rule become final, FSIS will 
sample and conduct nutrient analysis of 
ground or chopped products to verify 
compliance with nutrition labeling 
requirements, even if nutrition labeling 
on these products is based on the most 
current representative data base values 
contained in USDA’s National Nutrient 
Data Bank or the USDA National 
Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference and there are no claims on the 
labeling. Therefore, FSIS will treat 
ground or chopped products as it treats 
all other products for which the 
regulations require nutrition 
information on their package. In the 
event that FSIS samples and conducts 
nutrient analysis of ground or chopped 
beef, if producers know the fat content 
of their product and have used USDA 
database values on the nutrition labels, 
FSIS would find the product’s label in 
compliance with nutrition labeling 
requirements, provided the product’s 
source materials did not include AMR 
product or product from low 
temperature rendering. 
Costs and Benefits 
Comment: Many commenters stated 
that the proposed rule would result in 
increased label costs. For example, one 
individual stated that it would cost a 
little more for production but did not 
think that it would affect the profit of 
major meat companies. Another 
individual stated that the rule would 
increase the final price of the product 
and require a change in packaging. 
A small retailer who carries 26 
different packages of ground meat in 
their stores and packages 6,000 packages 
per week stated that it would cost the 
company more than $22,600 a year in 
added costs due to labor and the 
additional labels that would be needed. 
Another small retailer estimated that the 
cost would approach $10,000 annually 
for adding a new poster and taking into 
account the necessary packaging, labor, 
and machinery modifications for ground 
or chopped products. 
A beef producer believed that FSIS’s 
cost estimates for requiring nutrition 
labeling for ground or chopped products 
are too low. This commenter stated that 
for those producers that must supply 
their own labels, the cost would be 
prohibitive. According to this 
commenter, if retail stores were to 
provide the information, the costs 
would be as calculated in the proposed 
rule. This commenter also believed that 
FSIS could still achieve its goal of 
having a large percent of compliance by 
making information on the label 
optional for certain groups that would 
be financially burdened. This 
commenter noted that FSIS estimated 
that the average weight of packages of 
ground or chopped products is 2 
pounds and stated that the average 
weight of a package of pasture fed 
ground beef is between one and 1.5 
pounds. 
An animal protection organization 
contacted a major commercial 
laboratory that conducts nutrient 
analysis. This commenter stated that the 
laboratory charges $130 for a single 
sample analysis for total fat and 
saturated fat and $85 for cholesterol. 
The laboratory gives volume discounts 
for multiple samples. 
According to an industry association 
commenter, the majority of retailers do 
not have equipment, such as a Fat-O- 
Meter or CEM analyzer, to determine the 
exact nutritional content, including the 
percentage of fat for their products. It is 
unlikely, according to this commenter, 
that retailers will be able to afford this 
type of equipment because it costs 
nearly $40,000. 
A retail industry organization stated 
that according to Hobart, the company 
that manufacturers a large proportion of 
the scales used by retailers, 50 to 60 
percent of supermarkets would need to 
upgrade their current printers, which 
represents $45 to $75 million in costs. 
Also, 40 to 50 percent of supermarkets 
would be required to replace their entire 
scale systems at the store level, which 
Hobart estimates would cost $54 to $90 
million. In addition, according to this 
commenter, substantially more 
sophisticated and more expensive 
analytical equipment or laboratory 
testing will be needed to measure the 
nutrient profiles in ground products, 
which are likely to vary significantly in 
the context of USDA’s compliance and 
enforcement standards. 
Another retail industry association 
stated that a distributing company 
supplying 200 supermarkets estimated 
that the labeling requirement for ground 
or chopped products would affect over 
20 million packages annually. Using the 
FSIS estimate of .005 cents per label, the 
labels alone would cost $100,000 per 
year. In addition, this commenter stated 
that although retail stores may be able 
to assess fat content by using a fat 
analyzer when doing in-store grinding, 
testing for nutrient content would 
require the use of a laboratory and prove 
costly. The commenter stated that these 
costs would cause many retailers that 
provide on-site custom service to 
increase prices or sell case-ready meat 
only, to the detriment of consumer 
choice. 
Two individuals were concerned that 
the proposed rule would increase the 
price of meat; one stated that if people 
wanted nutrition information for meat 
and poultry products, stores would 
already provide the information on the 
packages. 
In terms of the overall costs and 
benefits of compliance, an animal 
protection organization stated that, if 
the analyses and costs estimated by 
FSIS are accurate, it is evident that 
consumers need more information than 
they are currently getting. The 
commenter further stated that the costs 
to industry are negligible when 
compared to the benefits to the 
consumer. 
An industry association stated that 
FSIS will also incur costs. According to 
this commenter, if the Agency requires 
on-package labeling for ground product, 
to verify compliance, it will be diverting 
a significant portion of its resources to 
the chemical analysis of numerous 
ground products produced at retail 
levels across the United States. The 
commenter also stated that, while FSIS 
has increased its level of sampling at the 
retail level for the purpose of 
microbiological sampling of E. coli 
O157:H7, it should also be able to 
collect additional samples for chemical 
analysis simultaneously. However, the 
commenter stated that FSIS would also 
be incurring new costs associated with 
sending samples to the laboratories as 
well as the actual cost of the analyses. 
Response: FSIS recognized that the 
proposal, like many regulations 
promulgated by various government 
entities, would result in increased costs 
to various affected parties, so it is not 
surprising to FSIS that commenters 
would indicate that they would incur 
increased compliance costs. The 
commenter who stated that the rule 
would cost it $22,464 annually also 
stated that it produces 6,000 packages of

commenter who said it would cost them 
$10,000 annually also said that they sell 
100,000 packages annually. This equates 
to a per label cost of ten cents. Both 
estimates are significantly higher than 
any estimate prepared by FSIS. The 
Agency does not doubt that these 
retailers may incur higher labeling costs 
should this rule become final, but FSIS 
is unsure how their estimates were 
prepared. For example, FSIS is unsure 
as to whether these estimates include 
certain costs that should or should not 
be attributed to the proposal. At this 
time, the Agency is not in the position 
to accept these estimates as being 
comparable (in methodology or 
assumptions) to the costs presented by 
FSIS. As explained in the supplemental 
PRIA, FSIS estimates that retailers 
would incur the costs of upgrading store 
scales and printers to include nutrition 
information, redesigning larger store 
labels, providing nutrition analysis for 
each product, and using larger labels. 
The Agency has reviewed the 
concerns of the beef producer but, with 
the limited supporting information 
provided, finds that the commenter’s 
concerns are unconvincing. At no time 
does the commenter indicate what its 
costs might be, so it is difficult to 
determine how burdensome the 
requirements are for this producer. 
The beef producer stated that the 
average weight of a package of pasture 
fed ground beef is between one and 1.5 
pounds. However, in the supplemental 
PRIA cost analysis, FSIS estimates that 
the average weight of a retail package is 
2.7 pounds (ranging from 1.7 pounds at 
the 5th percentile, to 4.35 at the 95th 
percentile). This estimate is from the 
National Cattlemen’s Beef Association 
(NCBA), and FSIS believes this estimate 
better reflects the average weight of a 
retail package of ground product than 
the figure the commenter provided for 
pasture fed ground beef. NCBA’s source 
is the Meat Purchase Diary, which is a 
survey. Although FSIS believes that 
NCBA data provide a sound estimate of 
the average weight of a retail package of 
ground product, there is some 
uncertainty in this estimate, because 
NCBA does not release any detailed data 
from its survey. 
With regard to the comments on the 
cost of samples and nutrient analysis, 
the supplemental PRIA cost analysis 
includes costs of nutrition analysis 
ranging from $599 to $787 per modified 
label. These are costs required to create 
a nutrition facts panel. As explained in 
the cost analysis below, FSIS does not 
believe that the cost of a fat analyzer 
should be attributed to this rule. Stores 
may receive product for which a fat 
analysis has been performed and labeled 
accordingly. Also, as explained above, 
retailers currently must have a means of 
knowing that their product meets the 
standard of identity for ground beef. 
With regard to the comment on the 
costs of upgrading scale printers, FSIS’s 
supplemental PRIA cost analysis 
estimates the cost of updating scale 
printers at $2,400 per store or $56.35 
million total. FSIS also estimated 
annual scale maintenance costs at $144 
every year after the first year the scale 
has been purchased. Therefore, the 
supplemental PRIA analysis is 
consistent with the comment on 
updating scale printers. 
In response to the comment that costs 
would cause many retailers that provide 
on-site custom service to increase 
prices, products that are ground or 
chopped at an individual customer’s 
request and that are prepared or sold at 
retail are exempt from nutrition labeling 
requirements, provided the labels or 
labeling of those products bear no 
nutrition claim or nutrition information. 
In response to the comments from 
individuals concerned that the rule 
would increase the price of meat, as 
explained in the supplemental PRIA 
cost analysis, the cost of this rule is not 
likely to be excessive relative to the 
volume of input of ground or chopped 
meat and poultry products sold at retail. 
The estimated cost of the rule on a per 
pound basis is $.0053. This increase in 
cost should not affect consumer 
purchases. 
In response to the statement that 
nutrition information would be 
available if people wanted it, market 
forces have not been great enough to 
ensure significant participation in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program. 
This fact could be evidence that 
consumers are not willing to pay for this 
information. Nonetheless, as is 
explained above, FSIS believes that 
consumers have reasonable expectations 
concerning the nutrient content of the 
major cuts of meat and poultry 
products, but they need precise 
information about the nutrient content 
of the major cuts in order to make a 
fully informed comparative judgment 
about the various cuts. In addition, the 
extent that such information conveys a 
negative credence attribute would limit 
its availability, if retailers were not 
required to disclose it. Without 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
of single-ingredient products and 
ground or chopped products, consumers 
do not have necessary and sufficient 
information to make informed 
purchasing decisions. 
As far as the overall costs and benefits 
of compliance, the Agency believes that 
it has done a reasonable job in 
estimating the costs and benefits of the 
proposal. 
In terms of cost to FSIS, in the 
Paperwork Reduction Act analysis, FSIS 
estimated that the costs of label and 
records review will total $300,000 
annually. Other costs the Agency incurs 
as a result of this rule will be negligible. 
The rule will not increase inspection 
activities substantially. Similarly, it will 
not increase substantially the laboratory 
costs associated with FSIS sampling and 
testing for nutrient analysis. FSIS will 
conduct inspection and testing activities 
under this rule concurrent with existing 
inspection and testing activities. 
Comment: A consumer organization 
asserted that FSIS overestimated the 
cost of the proposed rule by assuming 
that 20 percent of establishments would 
have to install new machinery for 
stamping, printing, or affixing nutrition 
labels for ground and chopped meat. 
The commenter believed that the 20 
percent estimate is too high. FSIS’s own 
1999 survey showed that 97 percent of 
large chains, 91 percent of large 
independent retailers, and 84 percent of 
medium and small independents 
already complied with the label 
requirements of the final rule for 
Mandatory Safe Handling Statements on 
Labeling of Raw Meat and Poultry 
products. In addition, the commenter 
noted that small firms are exempt from 
the proposed rule. 
Response: After the proposed rule was 
published, FSIS contracted with RTI 
International to assist the Agency in 
data collection and revising the cost 
analysis for the supplemental PRIA. 
Among the several changes based upon 
RTI’s review, FSIS revised the label cost 
estimates. The supplemental PRIA 
assumes that retail facilities and official 
establishments have not yet incurred 
any costs for nutrition labeling of 
ground or chopped products or major 
cuts. However, the supplemental PRIA 
also estimates the current levels of 
nutrition labeling and adjusts cost and 
benefit estimates to reflect current levels 
of nutrition labeling. 
Comment: According to a retail 
industry association, provisions 
requiring labels on individual packages 
of ground meat and poultry products 
will impose most costs and burdens 
upon independent retailers that offer 
custom service rather than pre-packaged 
case-ready meat. The commenter further 
alleged that the proposal would 
disproportionately affect independent 
operators and their customers, coercing 
retailers into increasing prices to cover 
increased costs or eliminating custom 
service because of the need to provide 
labeling for nutritional content of 
products ground in retail stores.

67757 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
One individual stated that the 
proposed requirements would adversely 
affect small businesses. Also, a small 
producer stated that providing nutrition 
information on the labels of ground 
products would be difficult and costly 
for the small farmer or producer selling 
beef wholesale to stores. 
Response: When Federal Agencies 
like FSIS issue rules, they are to make 
sure that the rules are fair to those being 
regulated. The Regulatory Flexibility 
Act requires Federal Agencies to 
consider the affect of regulations on 
small entities in developing regulations 
(see the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Analysis below). 
To minimize the burden on small 
businesses, should it become final, the 
rule will provide a small business 
exemption. In addition, the rule will 
provide an exemption from nutrition 
labeling requirements for ground or 
chopped products that are ground or 
chopped at an individual customer’s 
request and that are prepared and 
served or sold at retail, provided that 
the labels or labeling of these products 
bear no nutrition claims or nutrition 
information. FSIS also intends to 
provide nutrition labeling materials for 
the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products and for ground or chopped 
products on a free basis through its Web 
site. Retailers can display these 
materials at the point-of-purchase for 
the major cuts. Also, retailers and 
official establishments can obtain 
nutrition information for ground or 
chopped products at the following Web 
site: http://www.ars.usda.gov. 
Comment: A consumer organization 
argued that FSIS underestimated the 
benefits of the rule by ignoring both the 
impact of meat and poultry 
consumption on non-fatal cases of heart 
disease and cancer and the impact on 
obesity and its consequences. 
According to the commenter, FSIS 
limited its estimates of the benefits to 
the reduction in annual deaths from 
breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal 
cancer, and coronary heart disease. The 
commenter stated that this approach 
ignores the benefits to consumers in 
reducing the number of non-fatal cases 
of these four diseases. For example, 
according to the commenter, when FDA 
evaluated the benefits of its proposed 
rule on trans fatty acids in foods, the 
Agency estimated that only one-third of 
heart attack cases due to coronary heart 
disease are fatal. For non-fatal cases, 
FDA estimated the discounted value of 
the reduction in functional disability 
and pain and suffering of the patient 
and the reduction in medical costs at 
$282,000 per case (or 33.5 percent of the 
FDA’s estimated value of $840,000 per 
fatal case). According to the commenter, 
as there are two non-fatal cases of 
coronary heart disease for every fatal 
case, FSIS should increase its benefits 
from the proposed rule by 67 percent. 
At a seven percent discount rate, this 
would increase the benefits over 20 
years from a reduction in coronary heart 
disease from FSIS’s current estimate of 
$752 million to $1.256 billion. 
The commenter also stated that 
similar adjustments could be made to 
account for the reductions in the non- 
fatal cases of three types of cancer that 
FSIS considered. About 42 percent of 
colorectal cancer cases are fatal, about 
16 percent of prostate cancer cases are 
fatal, and about 21 percent of breast 
cancer cases are fatal. The commenter 
believed that one could assume that the 
ratio of the benefits of reducing these 
non-fatal cases to the benefits of 
reducing the fatal ones is the same for 
these three types of cancer as FDA used 
for coronary heart disease, i.e., 33.5 
percent. Using a seven percent discount 
rate, the commenter estimated that 
including the reduction in non-fatal 
cases would increase the benefits over 
20 years from a reduction in these three 
types of cancer from FSIS’s current 
estimate of $167 million to $316 
million. 
In sum, including the impact of the 
proposed rule on non-fatal cases of the 
four diseases FSIS considered increases 
the total benefits (using a seven percent 
discount rate over 20 years) from $918 
million to $1.572 billion. 
When the commenter looked at the 
impact of the rule as it related to total 
fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, the 
commenter thought that the proposal 
might help lead to a reduction in 
weight, which, in turn, could lead to a 
reduction in both mortality and 
morbidity from various diseases. 
According to the commenter, recent 
studies placed the cost of obesity in the 
United States at $39 billion in direct 
medical costs and $48 billion in indirect 
loss of output because of both morbidity 
and mortality. Reducing these $87 
billion in annual costs by even 0.15 
percent through the provisions of this 
rule would mean additional annual 
benefits of $13.05 million, which (at a 
7 percent discount rate) means 
additional benefits over 20 years of 
about $138 million. 
In summary, the benefits of the 
proposed rule over 20 years (discounted 
at 7 percent)—taking account of 
morbidity and obesity—could well be 
$1.71 billion rather than the $918 
million estimated in the proposed rule 
based on FSIS’s examining only 
mortality. 
Conversely, a meat industry 
organization cautioned FSIS against 
making the mortality assumptions 
included in the proposed rule’s benefits 
analysis. This commenter stated that 
FSIS’s assumptions were based on only 
one part of meat’s nutrient content. The 
commenter stated that, while diets high 
in saturated fat and cholesterol have 
been associated with risk of chronic 
disease, meat has never been shown to 
cause such diseases. 
A farmer/rancher believed that the 
new nutrition labeling requirements 
could potentially encourage consumers 
to eat more meat, which would increase 
her profits. 
Response: In response to the comment 
concerning non-fatal cases of heart 
disease and cancer, FSIS has reviewed 
all of the information provided by this 
commenter and believes that the 
information provided on coronary heart 
disease is potentially useful to the FSIS 
analysis. The information on the 
relationship between fatal cases and 
non-fatal cases of coronary heart disease 
is reliable in that FDA looked at the 
relevant literature and medical statistics 
to determine the annual number of heart 
attack cases of coronary heart disease 
that occur and the percent of those 
(occurring each year) that are fatal. This 
allows for a total, in a given year, of the 
number of heart attack cases that are not 
fatal, based just on new heart attack 
cases. FSIS agrees that a reduction in 
non-fatal cases of chronic heart disease 
would result in a significant benefit to 
society. The methods for estimating 
both the number of non-fatal cases 
avoided annually, and the value of non- 
fatal cases avoided annually are 
unsettled and further research is needed 
to improve the reliability of this 
information. 
The information on colorectal, 
prostate, and breast cancer is not as 
reliable as that on non-fatal cases of 
coronary heart disease. Specifically, the 
information reported by the American 
Cancer Society represents the annual 
number of new cases, but the annual 
number of deaths includes deaths from 
both old cases and new cases of disease. 
In other words, the annual number of 
deaths also represents deaths from cases 
that were reported as new cases in 
previous years. Therefore, if FSIS were 
to adopt the information suggested by 
this commenter, then the denominator 
used to calculate the percent of fatal 
cases to all cases would be too small 
and the percent of fatal cases would be 
too high. Consequently, the benefits 
estimates associated with the reduction 
of non-fatal cases would be greater than 
the actual value of benefits. It should be 
noted however, that to ignore the

benefits associated with the reduction of 
non-fatal cases is also incorrect because, 
in fact, some benefits exist even though 
methods are not available to provide 
reliable estimates. At this time, it is not 
possible to provide a quantitative 
estimate of the benefits associated with 
reducing the non-fatal cases of 
colorectal, prostate, breast cancer, and 
coronary heart diseases. 
Although the consumer organization 
recommended that FSIS revise the 
benefits estimate to include specific 
benefits associated with weight loss, 
FSIS did not account for these benefits 
in the final analysis. FSIS does not have 
the data necessary to estimate these 
benefits, and the commenter did not 
provide the data. 
With regard to the industry comment 
that cautioned against making the 
benefits assumptions included in the 
preliminary benefits analysis, the 
supplemental PRIA benefits analysis is 
consistent with the preliminary benefits 
analysis. Therefore, the supplemental 
PRIA benefits analysis estimates the 
value of potential changes from intake 
of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol that 
could occur as consumers respond to 
newly available nutrition information. 
The supplemental PRIA analysis uses 
changes in serum cholesterol to estimate 
health outcomes, which are reductions 
in the number of cases and mortality 
from three cancers and coronary heart 
disease. FSIS used survey data and a 
model developed by Zarkin, et al. to 
conduct the benefit analysis. The 
industry commenter did not provide 
data that would allow FSIS to conduct 
an alternative benefit analysis. 
With regard to the comment that new 
nutrition labeling requirements could 
encourage consumers to eat more meat, 
FSIS does not have data that indicate 
that consumers will consume more meat 
as a consequence of new nutrition 
labeling requirements. Therefore, the 
supplemental PRIA benefits analysis 
does not include increased profits to 
producers. 
Comment: One individual stated that 
there are benefits to individuals in 
keeping track of their nutritional intake. 
This commenter believed that he would 
find it valuable to know the levels of the 
different nutrients in meat and poultry 
products. 
Response: FSIS concurs that there are 
benefits to keeping track of an 
individual’s nutritional intake. The 
level of benefits associated with 
nutrition labeling depends on the extent 
to which consumers change their food 
consumption in favor of products that 
are more nutritious. To accomplish this, 
a consumer needs to keep track of his 
or her nutritional intake. 
Comment: One individual stated that 
nutrition labeling on raw meat and 
poultry products could potentially lead 
to some decreases in the sale of red 
meat. The commenter also stated that 
poultry and fish will become more 
popular. The commenter did not 
anticipate a big overall change in sales. 
An animal protection organization 
also stated that the net effect of the rule 
may be a decrease in the overall 
consumption of meat. 
Response: Should this rule become 
final, the impact of the rule will depend 
upon the extent to which consumers 
change their food consumption in favor 
of products that they believe are more 
consistent with a healthy diet. 
Therefore, it is possible, as the 
commenters stated, that nutrition 
labeling on raw meat and poultry 
products could lead to some decreases 
in the sale or consumption of red meat 
as well as some increases in the sale of 
poultry and fish. FSIS has no 
information that would allow the 
Agency to measure such impact. 
Therefore, the supplemental PRIA does 
not reflect any anticipated changes in 
the volume of meat and poultry 
products consumed annually. 
Comment: A consumer organization 
stated that there are significant 
differences between African Americans 
and Caucasions in the incidence of the 
four diseases that the FSIS examined in 
determining the benefits of the proposed 
rule. According to this commenter, 
African Americans are 50 percent more 
likely than Caucasians to die of heart 
disease, 43 percent more likely to die of 
colorectal cancer, 153 percent more 
likely to die of prostate cancer, and 38 
percent more likely to die of breast 
cancer. African Americans are also 140 
percent more likely than Caucasians to 
die of diabetes, a disease linked to 
obesity. 
Response: The benefits analysis that 
was prepared for this rulemaking does 
not estimate benefits attributable to 
specific groups (e.g., Caucasians or 
different minority groups). However, the 
benefits analysis does measure the 
impact to all affected parties. Therefore, 
no group of individuals has been 
excluded. Assuming that the 
information provided by this 
commenter is correct, then the rule may 
have a greater positive impact on 
minorities than on Caucasians. 
Other Comments 
Comments: Two industry 
organizations suggested that other 
nutrients, e.g., zinc, and B-vitamins, 
should be required nutrients in 
nutrition labeling of meat and poultry 
products. One producer suggested that 
USDA provide information on omega 3 
fatty acids and Conjugated Linoleic 
Acid (CLA) in the nutrient data base. 
One commenter suggested the addition 
of a warning label on meat products 
stating, ‘‘Meat consumption has been 
linked in research to a higher risk for 
heart disease, cancer, hypertension, 
diabetes, and other serious diseases.’’ 
Response: These comments are 
beyond the scope of the regulation. 
Comment: One industry commenter 
suggested that what was needed most 
was more consumer education on 
understanding and interpreting 
nutrition facts panels. 
Response: FSIS’s requirements for 
nutrition facts panels are consistent 
with FDA’s requirements for nutrition 
facts panels. FSIS has no information 
indicating that consumers are confused 
regarding the information displayed on 
nutrition facts panels. However, if FSIS 
receives information indicating that 
consumers need more education 
concerning the information on nutrition 
facts panels, the Agency will consider 
developing consumer education 
materials to aid consumers in 
understanding the nutrition facts 
panels. 
Comment: One commenter suggested 
that a uniform compliance date should 
be provided for meat and poultry 
labeling requirements. 
Response: FSIS has published a final 
rule that establishes January 1, 2012, as 
the uniform compliance date for new 
food labeling regulations that are issued 
between January 1, 2009, and December 
31, 2010 (73 FR 75564). FSIS issued 
these regulations to enhance the 
industry’s ability to make orderly 
adjustments to new labeling 
requirements without unduly exposing 
consumers to outdated labels and to 
minimize the economic impact of 
labeling changes. Should this rule 
become final, the January 1, 2012, 
effective date will apply to the nutrition 
labeling requirements for ground or 
chopped products because nutrition 
labels will be required on ground or 
chopped products, unless an exemption 
applies. Should it become final, this 
rule will allow nutrition information for 
the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products at their 
point-of-purchase, not on the product. 
Therefore, FSIS intends to make the 
labeling requirements for the major cuts 
effective one year from the date of 
publication of the final rule. 
Comment: One commenter stated that 
it had heard that the data in the USDA 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference are not current, and that 
USDA is undertaking nutrient analyses 
of additional fat/lean combinations (e.g.,

93/7; 90/10; 85/15) of ground beef. This 
commenter recommended that USDA 
forestall promulgation or 
implementation of these nutrition 
labeling regulations until all of the 
necessary information is available. 
Should FSIS finalize the rule, the 
commenter recommended that FSIS 
adopt an 18-month implementation 
period for the regulations. 
Response: As noted above, the USDA 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference includes nutrient values for 
ground beef product containing 5%, 
10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% fat. In 
addition, ARS has included a calculator 
on the Internet that will calculate the 
nutrient values of a particular ground 
beef product based on the fat or lean 
value entered. 
Should it become final, the effective 
date for the nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products will be January 1, 2012. 
Therefore, the affected industry will 
likely have more than 18 months prior 
to FSIS’s implementation of the rule for 
ground or chopped products. 
Section II. Executive Order 12866— 
Supplemental Proposed Rule 
Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) 
This action has been reviewed for 
compliance with Executive Order 
12866. As this action is determined 
‘‘economically significant’’ for purposes 
of Executive Order 12866, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) has 
reviewed it. 
This supplemental PRIA differs from 
the PRIA that was published for the 
proposed rule. The Food Safety and 
Inspection Service (FSIS), after 
reviewing public comments, has 
concluded that further analysis of the 
costs and benefits of the rule was 
required. RTI, International performed 
an in-depth analysis responding to those 
comments (RTI, International, 2003) that 
formed the basis for the revisions to the 
cost analysis. FSIS incorporated the RTI 
findings with minor changes into this 
final analysis. FSIS, among other 
revisions, has also added a discussion 
comparing the costs of regulatory 
alternatives, revised the analysis of 
benefits, and added a new section 
examining the cost effectiveness of the 
rule. 
This economic analysis uses the most 
current data available to the Agency. It 
relies on the U.S. economic census data 
from 2002, released in a report dated 
November 2005. Even though the data 
collection for the ‘‘U.S. Bureau of the 
Census—2007 Economic Census’’ has 
been completed, because the detailed 
reporting on the retail firms and 
establishments that would likely be 
affected by the final rule is not 
scheduled to be available to the Agency 
until about October 2010, FSIS was 
unable to use that data. Thus, Tables 3, 
4, and 5 (below), which rely on the 2002 
census data, have the most current 
information on these retail firms and 
establishments available. Further, the 
Agency used data from the FSIS 
Performance Based Inspection System 
(PBIS), April 2006, to estimate the 
number of Federally- and State- 
inspected meat and poultry slaughter 
and processing establishments that 
would likely be affected by the final 
rule. These are the most representative 
data available to the Agency on the time 
period around the 2002 economic 
census data. In addition, the Agency 
used 2005 costs because they are the 
most representative data available to the 
Agency, for the time period reflected in 
the 2002 economic census data. 
The Agency requested that the 
Interagency Economic Peer Review 
Group coordinate a peer review of the 
final regulatory impact analysis. The 
peer reviews conducted by two 
economists from Federal agencies and 
the FSIS responses to their comments 
are available in the FSIS docket room 
and on the FSIS Web page with the 
supplemental proposed rule. 
FSIS is proposing to amend the 
Federal meat and poultry products 
inspection regulations to require 
nutrition labeling of the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products, unless an exemption applies. 
Should this rule become effective, the 
guidelines for voluntary nutrition 
labeling will become mandatory for 
these products. 
FSIS is also proposing to amend its 
regulations to require on-package 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
meat and poultry products. The Agency 
has determined that single-ingredient, 
raw ground or chopped meat and 
poultry products are different from 
other single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products in several important 
respects, and that these products are 
similar to products in the current 
mandatory program that are required to 
bear nutrition labels. Thus, under this 
rule, the nutrition labeling requirements 
for all ground or chopped meat and 
poultry products will be consistent with 
the nutrition labeling requirements for 
multi-ingredient and heat processed 
products. 
The supplementary proposed rule 
provides for a number of exemptions, 
including a small business exemption. 
Should the rule become final, small 
businesses will be exempt from the 
requirement for nutrition labeling of 
single-ingredient, raw ground or 
chopped products. Small businesses are 
those with 500 or fewer employees, are 
owned by companies with 500 or fewer 
employees, and produce 100,000 
pounds or less annually of each ground 
product affected by the rule.1 
A. Need for the Rule 
FSIS believes that less than the 
optimal amount of nutrition information 
is being provided because consumers 
cannot independently determine the 
nutritional qualities of the meat and 
poultry products affected by the rule, 
thus leading to insufficient incentives 
for processors and retailers to reveal the 
nutrient content of these products. To 
the extent that consumers purchase 
these products to achieve a nutritional 
objective, information about the 
nutritional characteristics of these 
products has value. Some consumers 
may purchase or otherwise obtain such 
information at a cost. However, such 
information may be costly to obtain for 
most consumers, and such information 
may change in value with the 
development of new products with 
different nutritional characteristics. 
The association between consumption 
of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol with 
three types of cancer and coronary heart 
disease is discussed in the proposed 
rule (66 FR 4969, January 18, 2001) and 
the Supplemental PRIA Benefits 
Analysis of this section. In 2003, there 
were about 39,800 deaths in the United 
States from breast cancer, 29,800 deaths 
from prostate cancer, and 57,100 deaths 
from colorectal cancer. There were 
about 515,200 deaths from coronary 
heart disease in 2000. Consequently, a 
decline in the percentage of calories 
from fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol 
can lead to a potentially significant 
number of deaths averted. 
A substantial amount of theoretical 
and applied research has been 
conducted on the economics of 
consumer information since first 
discussed by Stigler, and subsequently 
by Lancaster and Rosen. Economic 
theory now treats information on the 
characteristics of a good along with 
information on the price of the product 
as major determinants of consumer 
choice. 
A basis for required labeling exists 
when the market does not supply 
enough information to allow consumers 
to make consumption choices that 
reflect their individual preferences. 
Under conditions of asymmetric 
information, social costs and benefits

2 Credence attributes are characteristics of the 
quality of a product that the consumer cannot 
determine even after consumption (nutritional 
value, medical expertise). Credence characteristics 
will always require the consumer to acquire 
information, such as nutritional information, from 
the seller or third parties, whose credibility will 
vary. 
3 Single-ingredient, raw ground or chopped meat 
and poultry products is one of the two major 
product categories addressed in the rule. As the 
definition of this product does not change in the 
analysis, it will be referred to as ‘‘ground or 
chopped products’’. 
4 Major and nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, 
raw meat and poultry products is one of the two 
major product categories addressed in the rule. The 
category of products will be referred to as ‘‘major 
and nonmajor cuts’’. In the case where only major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and products are 
considered, they will be referred to as ‘‘major cuts’’. 
Nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products will be referred to as ‘‘nonmajor 
cuts’’. 
may suggest a different labeling 
outcome than the one resulting from a 
private firm’s labeling decision (Golan, 
et al.). Asymmetric information may 
particularly be a problem in markets for 
foods with negative credence attributes 2 
as is discussed below regarding 
products subject to the rule. 
In their examination of food 
consumption patterns before and after 
the general availability of information 
about nutritional characteristics, diet- 
disease connections, and health claims, 
a number of authors have confirmed the 
role of nutrition information in 
enhancing the ability of consumers to 
make healthier food choices (Kim et al., 
Neuhouser et al., Tiesl, et al. (1997, 
2001), Moorman, and Ippolito and 
Mathios (1990b, 1991, 1995, 1998). The 
results of these studies are discussed in 
the Benefits Analysis. 
Ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products are formulated by processors 
and the nutritional characteristics of 
these products may vary.3 In addition, 
without nutrition information for the 
major cuts, consumers cannot assess 
precise levels of fat and cannot know 
the levels of specific nutrients in these 
products.4 Major cuts are generally 
considered by consumers to be largely 
undifferentiated products in terms of 
nutrient content. If one supplier of 
major cuts provides the nutrient 
information, and such information is the 
same regardless of supplier, there is no 
incentive for other suppliers to incur the 
cost of providing the information. The 
extent that such information conveys a 
negative credence attribute would 
further limit its availability. 
As is explained above, FSIS believes 
that consumers have reasonable 
expectations as to the nutrient content 
of the major cuts. Competitive pressures 
among processors could over time 
increase the supply and accuracy of 
such information (Ippolito and Mathios, 
1991). However, the comparison 
between foods necessary to construct a 
healthy diet is made difficult if precise 
information about nutrient content is 
not provided, significantly different 
formats are used to provide nutrition 
information, or the information is 
difficult to interpret. Thus, the point-of- 
purchase (POP) nutrition information 
requirement and enforcement of 
accuracy will facilitate consumer efforts 
to construct a healthy diet and facilitate 
consumer understanding of the 
information provided. 
There is not uniform agreement that 
nutrition labeling is always an effective 
policy measure, even if government 
intervention were warranted on the 
basis of informational needs and social 
welfare. Variyam, Blaylock, and 
Smallwood, 1995 and 1997, found that 
labels are not an effective means for 
educating consumers and changing 
consumption behavior. However, these 
papers emphasize format and context of 
the information as important factors 
affecting the influence of the 
information on the audience. For 
example, consumers are more likely to 
read and understand labels that are clear 
and concise (Hadden; Magat and 
Viscusi; Noah). Some of the studies 
cited above (Tiesl and Levy, 1997, and 
Ippolito and Mathios, 1995) have found 
that the effectiveness of nutrition labels 
are augmented within the context of 
broader nutrition education programs 
about diet-health linkages. 
Golan, et al., summarize research 
showing when nutrition labeling is the 
most appropriate policy tool. Conditions 
when labeling may be appropriate 
include: 
• Consumer preferences differ. 
Labeling may be preferable if consumer 
preferences differ widely with respect to 
product characteristics, in this case total 
fat, cholesterol, saturated fat, calcium, 
and iron for example. As is the case for 
high sodium foods, consumers show 
significantly different attitudes to fat 
content. 
• Information is clear and concise. To 
be effective, the information on the label 
is clear, concise, and informative. FSIS 
believes that this criterion will be 
achieved for both nutrition labels and 
POP information. 
FSIS concludes that these conditions 
exist for the products subject to the rule 
or would be accomplished by the rule. 
FSIS also concludes that nutrition labels 
and POP information are superior to 
other tools such as food bans, taxes on 
fat content, and consumer education 
programs. 
Ippolito and Mathios (1990a) argued 
that competition among food suppliers 
and consumer skepticism about 
suppliers’ claims for their foods often 
leads to well-informed consumers. If, for 
example, consumers were concerned 
about dietary intake of sodium, a 
supplier with a product low in sodium 
would advertise that attribute. If 
consumers were also concerned about 
fat, a supplier with a low-sodium and 
low-fat product would advertise both 
attributes. Consumers would know that 
the low-sodium product that does not 
make a low-fat claim is likely a higher- 
fat product. And any product that is 
silent on both attributes is higher in 
sodium and fat. 
But Ippolito and Mathios also argued 
there could be conditions under which 
unfolding of information fails to occur 
and consumers are not informed about 
important product attributes. Unfolding 
might not occur when similar products 
share a negative attribute, like having a 
high fat content when consumers are 
concerned about the fat content of 
foods. If all competing foods share a 
high fat content, all suppliers have 
products embodying a negative 
attribute, and no supplier would have 
an incentive to advertise fat content. In 
that case, mandatory nutrition labels 
might provide consumers with 
information they want and did not have. 
From a statutory perspective, the lack 
of nutrition information on the labeling 
of the major cuts and on ground or 
chopped products is misleading because 
material facts or attributes about these 
products are not disclosed to the public. 
The FMIA and PPIA provide that 
product is misbranded if its labeling is 
false or misleading in any particular 
way (21 U.S.C. §§ 601(n)(1) and 
453(h)(1)). Therefore, without nutrition 
information for the major cuts and for 
ground or chopped products, FSIS has 
concluded that these products would be 
misbranded under section 1(n) of the 
FMIA or section 4(h) of the PPIA (66 FR 
4974, January 18, 2001). 
FSIS believes that the nutrition 
labeling requirements, when 
implemented, will provide consumers 
with valuable information, leading to 
improved dietary decisions. By 
increasing consumer awareness of the 
levels of total fat, saturated fat, and 
cholesterol in meat and poultry 
products affected by the rule, nutrition 
labeling may serve as a further incentive 
to food retailers and official 
establishments to provide products with 
reduced levels of these nutrients. FSIS 
has concluded that further action is 
necessary in order to provide consumers 
with adequate nutrition information.

67761 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
5 Unless stated otherwise, when discussing meat 
and poultry processing establishments, Federally- 
inspected establishments will be referred to as 
‘‘establishments’’. State-inspected establishments 
will be referred to as ‘‘State inspected 
establishments’’. 
6 It is possible that some very small 
establishments could potentially be affected by the 
requirements if they are owned by companies with 
more than 500 employees and they produce more 
than 100,000 pounds of any ground product. 
However, FSIS has concluded that this is a 
reasonable criterion for defining very small 
establishments that would be exempt from certain 
provisions of the rule. FSIS has not received public 
comment objecting to the use of this criterion and 
does not believe that establishments would alter 
their operations to meet this criterion. 
7 The PBIS does not include data on the size of 
the owning company or on processed food volumes. 
Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether 
some of these establishments qualify for the small 
business exemption. 
B. Baseline 
The rule would affect Federal 
establishments and may affect State 
establishments 5 that produce ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products. 
The rule would also affect retail food 
establishments such as supermarkets, 
grocery stores, meat markets, warehouse 
clubs, and superstores. To be 
conservative, FSIS has included State 
establishments in this analysis. The 
Agency used its Performance Based 
Inspection System (PBIS) database of 
April 2006 to determine the number of 
active Federally-inspected 
establishments producing ground or 
chopped products affected by the rule 
(Table 1). 
TABLE 1—SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL ESTABLISHMENTS PRODUCING GROUND OR CHOPPED PRODUCTS 
Size Number 
Very Small (9 or fewer employees or less than $2.5 million in sales annually) ........................................................................... 1,433 
Small (10 to 499 employees) ........................................................................................................................................................ 858 
Large (500 or more employees) .................................................................................................................................................... 109 
Total ........................................................................................................................................................................................ 2,400 
Source: FSIS Performance Based Inspection System (PBIS), April 2006. 
For purposes of this analysis, very 
small establishments, defined as those 
with 9 or fewer employees or less than 
$2.5 million in annual sales are exempt 
from the requirement for nutrition 
labeling of single-ingredient, raw 
ground or chopped products because 
they have 500 or fewer employees, are 
owned by companies with 500 or fewer 
employees, and FSIS assumes they 
produce 100,000 pounds or less 
annually of each ground product.6 Some 
small establishments may also be 
exempt from the regulation for the same 
reasons that some very small 
establishments are exempt.7 
Nutrition labels are designed for 
company-wide use. FSIS estimated the 
number of affected companies by 
dividing the number of small and large 
Federal establishments in Table 1 by 
three. Based on research, multi- 
establishment firms own an average of 
three establishments (Muth, 2003, RTI, 
2003). That is, 858 small establishments 
+ 109 large establishments /3 = 322 
small and large firms. Some of these 
Federal establishments may be 
independent and may not be part of a 
multi-establishment firm. Similarly, 
some very small establishments may be 
part of a multi-establishment firm. 
Therefore, this is an area of uncertainty 
in the analysis. However, FSIS believes 
its assumptions are reasonable for 
purposes of estimating costs. 
In addition, the Agency used the PBIS 
to estimate the number of active State 
establishments producing single- 
ingredient, raw ground or chopped meat 
and poultry products that would be 
affected by the rule (Table 2). The 
information in PBIS on State 
establishments may not be complete. 
Thus, the Agency may be 
underestimating the number of State 
establishments, or the total number of 
these establishments that would be 
affected by the rule.

Large (500 or more employees) .................................................................................................................................................... 0 
Total ........................................................................................................................................................................................ 673

Most, if not all, of these State 
establishments may be independent and 
may not be part of a multi-establishment 
firm. Very small State establishments 
are exempt from the requirement for 
nutrition labeling of ground or chopped 
products because they have 500 or fewer 
employees, and the agency has assumed 
that they are owned by companies with 
fewer than 500 employees and produce 
100,000 pounds or less annually of each 
ground product. Some small State 
establishments may also be exempt from 
the regulation for the same reasons that 
some very small Federal establishments 
are exempt. Nutrition labels are 
designed for company-wide use. Thus, 
for purposes of the analysis the number 
of small State establishments and firms 
are the same. 
The total estimated number of meat 
and poultry processing firms is 363 
firms (322 firms with establishments + 
41 firms with State establishments) that 
would be producing ground or chopped 
meat and poultry products that would 
be affected by the rule. 
Based on the U.S. Economic Census 
for 2002, there are 47,688 retail firms 
and 74,910 retail establishments that 
would be affected by the POP 
requirements for the major cuts of meat 
and poultry (Table 3). Despite FSIS 
encouragement of retailers’ use of (POP) 
materials for the major cuts, the October 
1999 voluntary nutrition labeling survey

Should it become final, the rule 
would affect an estimated 21.6 billion 
pounds of meat and poultry products. 
Of this amount, 16.7 billion pounds are 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products and 4.9 billion pounds are 
ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products. The amount of ground or 
chopped product subject to the 
provisions by the rule is reduced from 
an estimated 6.2 billion pounds as a 
result of exemptions to small 
businesses. There are approximately 2.9 
billion pounds of nonmajor cuts. These 
products are not affected by the final 
rule; however they are affected by the 
requirements of Alternatives 2 and 5 
discussed in the following section. The 
source and derivation of these estimates 
are provided in Appendix A, Tables 1– 
4 and discussed in the Cost 
Effectiveness Analysis. 
These estimates, however, do not take 
into account the level of voluntary 
compliance with the nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products that currently exists. 
Consequently, the estimated amounts of 
ground or chopped products and major 
cuts that would be impacted by the final 
rule are overstated. However, in the 
analysis that follows we take into 
account the 68 percent compliance rate

(NCBA, 2004) of voluntary nutrition 
labeling of ground or chopped products 
and 54.8 percent level of voluntary 
compliance (USDA, 1999) of stores that 
provide nutrition labeling for major 
cuts. 
FSIS used data from USDA’s 
Continuing Survey of Food Intake by 
Individuals (CSFII), and the associated 
Diet and Health Knowledge Survey 
(DHKS) to establish a baseline for fat, 
saturated fat, and cholesterol intake. 
The CSFII collects data on food intakes 
by individuals. USDA conducted three 
separate one-year surveys for 1994–96 
(USDA, 1994–1996). These surveys 
recorded two nonconsecutive days of 
food consumption and collected 
information on what and how much 
individuals ate, and where the food was 
obtained. This information was used to 
develop estimates of nutrient intake for 
each individual respondent. The DHKS 
gathered data on consumers’ knowledge 
of issues related to diet and health, and 
contained several questions relating to 
the use of nutrition information labels 
and nutrition information for food 
products. Linking information from the 
two surveys allowed FSIS to correlate 
use of nutrition information from the 
DHKS with nutrient intake data from 
the CSFII. The Agency focused here on 
two key questions pertaining to 
nutrition information use on all food 
products and on meat and poultry in 
particular: Q: When you buy foods, do 
you use the nutrition panel that tells the 
amount of calories, protein, fat, and 
such [e.g., sodium, total carbohydrate] 
in the serving of a food: Often (always), 
sometimes, rarely, or never? (Question 
16–c, DKHS) Q: When you buy raw 
meat, poultry, or fish, do you look for 
nutrition information: Often (always), 
sometimes, rarely, or never? (Question 
17–I, DHKS). Using data from the CSFII 
and the DHKS, FSIS estimated rates of 
nutrition information usage, based on 
these two questions. The results are 
presented in Benefits Analysis (Table 
15) where they are used to establish a 
baseline for intake of fat, saturated fat, 
and cholesterol. Additional information 
is then used to estimate the impacts of 
label usage on dietary intakes of these 
nutrients, and the resulting human 
health effects. 
C. Regulatory Alternatives 
FSIS considered several regulatory 
alternatives: 
• Alternative 1: Continuing with the 
existing voluntary program; 
• Alternative 2: Making the voluntary 
program mandatory; 
• Alternative 3 (the supplemental 
proposed rule): Requiring nutrition 
information on labels of all ground or 
chopped products and making the 
voluntary program mandatory for the 
major cuts; 
• Alternative 4: Requiring nutrition 
information on labels of the major cuts 
and on all ground or chopped products; 
and 
• Alternative 5: Requiring nutrition 
information on labels of major and 
nonmajor cuts and all ground or 
chopped products. 
The provisions for the regulatory 
alternatives are summarized in the 
following table.

9 The stochastic model structure or framework, 
equation specification, statistical properties, 
assumptions, documentation, and results are 
presented in the tables of Appendix B and in 
Appendix D, Tables 2 and 3. In most cases, the 
minimum (low), maximum (high), and most-likely 
or mid-points values are to be found in the tables 
of Appendix B. In general, the values used 
represent information collected by RTI for the FDA 
Labeling Model, or other studies such as the NCBA 
surveys. Other values were assumed to be around 
a point-value that was collected by RTI, NCBA, or 
other referenced studies. Assumptions are made 
and tested for their effect on average cost of the 
alternatives considered. The results are in tables of 
Appendix B, and in Appendix D, Table 1 that has 
the summary of additional costs by alternative. In 
addition, Appendix D, Tables 2 and 3, have the 
detailed stochastic model framework of the 
economic analysis, and results of the preferred 
Alternative 3. 
10 Department of Labor, 2002. This wage 
represents an appropriate wage for a combination 
of managerial and regular staff that would be 
making available POP materials for major cuts and 
includes wages of $15.62 and fringe benefits of 
$5.49 per hour. 
11 This average annual cost has a range of 
variability of $8.03 million at the 5th percentile and 
8.53 at the 95th percentile (see Appendix B, Table 
10 and Appendix D, Table 1). 
12 This average annual cost has a range of 
variability of $85.10 million at the 5th percentile 
and $90.83 million at the 95th percentile (see 
Appendix B, Table 10 and Appendix D, Table 1). 
13 All present value calculations in the analysis of 
both costs and benefits use a 20-year time horizon. 
14 The term ‘‘success’’ or ‘‘successful’’ is used to 
aid the discussion in the cost effectiveness analysis 
where the effectiveness of the regulatory 
alternatives is discussed under scenarios where the 
impact (‘‘success’’) of POP nutrition information is 
varied relative to that of on-package nutrition labels 
in leading to dietary change. The use of the same 
term to refer to two different types of comparisons 
is intended to clarify the discussion. 
Uncertainty analyses are conducted to 
estimate cost distributions for each of 
the alternatives and the supplemental 
proposed rule. The stochastic cost 
model uses @RISK (Version 4.5, 
Palisades Corp.) to examine the effects 
of uncertainty. The model, statistical 
properties, assumptions, 
documentation, and results are 
presented in the tables of Appendix B 
and Appendix D, Tables 2 and 3.9 
Alternative 1: Continuing With the 
Voluntary Program 
FSIS considered continuing with the 
existing voluntary program and 
attempting to increase participation by 
providing additional assistance to the 
non-participants. FSIS considered 
providing nutrition information or POP 
materials directly to retail stores to 
encourage their participation in the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
and providing POP material files on the 
FSIS Web site that retailers could print 
and place in their stores. 
Under this alternative, retail 
establishments would continue to 
provide, on a voluntary basis, nutrition 
labeling for all single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products, including 
major cuts identified in §§ 317.344 and 
381.444 (including ground beef, ground 
pork) and cuts that are not identified as 
major cuts (including ground or 
chopped products not covered in 
§§ 317.344 and 381.444). This 
information could be provided at the 
point of purchase or on the label of the 
product. 
FSIS’s efforts to provide nutrition 
information or POP materials to retail 
stores to encourage their participation in 
the voluntary nutrition labeling program 
and to provide POP material files on the 
FSIS Web site could lead to additional 
participation in the voluntary nutrition 
labeling program. However, FSIS did 
not choose this alternative because, 
even though its cost is relatively low, 
the benefits of the alternative are also 
relatively low. This option would not 
ensure that nutrition information is 
provided for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products. In addition, FSIS did not 
choose this alternative because the 
Agency has determined that ground or 
chopped products that do not bear 
nutrition information would be 
misbranded under section 1(n)(1) of the 
FMIA and section 4(h)(1) of the PPIA. 
Therefore, POP materials would not be 
adequate to provide nutrition 
information for these products. 
Alternative 2: Make the Voluntary 
Program Mandatory 
FSIS considered making the voluntary 
program mandatory by requiring 
nutrition information, either on labels or 
at the point of purchase, for all single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products, including the major cuts and 
the nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, 
raw meat and poultry products. Under 
this alternative, FSIS would assume that 
most retailers would display POP 
information for these products rather 
than nutrition labels, because this is a 
low-cost means of providing nutrition 
information for multiple products. 
FSIS believes the vehicle chosen by 
retail establishments for displaying 
nutrition information at the point of 
purchase for all major and nonmajor 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products would be a reference 
manual, because placards covering all 
the major and nonmajor cuts would take 
up product display space and result in 
visual clutter. In addition, a manual 
may be easier for consumers to use than 
numerous placards covering all major 
and nonmajor cuts, and all the 
numerous formulations of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products. A 
manual about the size of the Uniform 
Retail Meat and Identity Standards 
publication could include nutrition 
information for all the major and 
nonmajor cuts, including nutrition 
information for numerous formulations 
of ground or chopped products. The 
Uniform Retail Meat and Identity 
Standards publication is approximately 
100 pages, with a page size of 81⁄2x11, 
in a three-ring binder. The publication 
provides meat identification standards 
for all cuts. However, the publication 
does not provide nutrition information 
or information on poultry cuts. Such 
information would have to be assembled 
from other sources for inclusion in the 
manual. 
This publication, including shipping 
and handling costs, is available for 
purchase through the National 
Cattleman’s Beef Association for a 
minimum cost of $97.50; most-likely 
cost of $100.00; or a maximum cost of 
$102.50. In the cost analysis of the 
alternative chosen, FSIS estimated there 
are about 74,910 retail establishments 
(Table 3). FSIS assumed that the manual 
would be replaced annually. FSIS 
estimated the labor cost of displaying 
POP information for the major cuts at 
$21.11 per hour.10 The time to obtain 
and make available POP information for 
the major cuts per store, an average of 
0.5 hour, is the same as that used to 
estimate the cost of Alternative 3, the 
supplemental proposed rule. Based on 
these estimates, the annual costs of this 
alternative is estimated to be 
$8,281,675.11 This estimate is 
comprised of $790,675 for labor costs 
(74,910 establishments × $21.11/hour × 
.5 hours) and $7,491,000 for the cost of 
the reference manual (74,910 × $100.00/ 
establishment). The average present 
value of this cost is estimated at $87.74 
million12 when discounted at 7 percent 
over 20 years.13 
This alternative would be less 
expensive than the alternative chosen 
by the Agency. As explained in the 
preamble to the proposed rule, FSIS is 
unable to distinguish between the 
benefits that would accrue from 
requiring nutrition labels on products 
versus nutrition information on POP 
materials (66 FR 4984–4985, January 18, 
2001). Research is not available to 
differentiate the benefits of nutrition 
information on labels versus nutrition 
information on displays. This is a 
significant area of uncertainty in 
analyzing benefits of the regulatory 
alternatives. 
The benefits of this alternative may be 
comparable to the benefits of the 
alternative chosen if POP nutrition 
information and on-package labels have 
roughly the same amount of success 14

15 As the success of point-of-purchase information 
declines relative to on-package nutrition labels, 
there is a proportional decline in dietary changes 
and consequently a proportional decline in lives 
saved associated with that measure, given the 
differences in that amount of product affected. 
16 Ground or chopped products or not covered in 
§§ 317.344 and 381.444 will be referred to as 
‘‘ground or chopped products’’ in the remainder of 
the final regulatory impact analysis. 
in leading to dietary change.15 However, 
because there are numerous 
formulations of ground or chopped 
products, it would be difficult for 
producers or retailers to develop POP 
materials that would address all the 
different formulations that exist for 
these products. Furthermore, it would 
be difficult for consumers to find the 
correct information for a specific ground 
or chopped product on POP materials 
that include information concerning 
numerous formulations of these 
products (66 FR 4977, January 18, 2001). 
To use POP materials only, without 
nutrition labels, consumers would have 
to find the nutrition information for a 
specific fat and lean formulation among 
multiple formulations. If a statement of 
the fat percentage is not included on a 
package of ground products, consumers 
would not know which nutrient data 
concerning ground product on POP 
materials would apply to that particular 
ground product. Therefore, because this 
option may not result in benefits 
associated with the consumption of 
ground or chopped products, this option 
would likely result in lower benefits 
compared to the option chosen. In 
addition, FSIS did not choose this 
alternative because it does not allow for 
any distinction between major and 
nonmajor cuts. FSIS has determined 
that it is not appropriate or necessary to 
require nutrition information for 
nonmajor cuts that are not ground or 
chopped at this time. 
Alternative 3 (Supplemental Proposed 
Rule): Require Nutrition Information on 
Labels of All Ground or Chopped 
Products and Make the Voluntary 
Program Mandatory for the Major Cuts 
(Other Than Ground Beef, Ground Pork) 
Should this rule become final, it will 
require nutrition information on the 
labels of all ground or chopped products 
and requires nutrition information, 
either on their labels or at their POP, for 
the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
products, unless such products qualify 
for an exemption. Under this 
alternative, retail establishments and 
processors of meat and poultry products 
could continue to voluntarily provide 
nutrition information for nonmajor cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products that are not ground or 
chopped. This approach allows for a 
distinction between ground or chopped 
products and other cuts. It also allows 
for a distinction between major and 
nonmajor cuts. 
Consistent with the regulations, the 
most recent voluntary nutrition labeling 
survey (USDA, 1999) only assessed 
whether retail stores provided nutrition 
labeling for the major cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products. Until some assessment is 
made of whether adequate information 
is being provided for the nonmajor cuts 
of single-ingredient, raw products that 
are not ground or chopped, FSIS cannot 
determine whether it would be 
beneficial to require nutrition 
information for these products. 
The derivations of the costs of 
Alternative 3 are shown in the section, 
Supplemental PRIA Cost Analysis. The 
average total present value of the costs 
of this alternative is $348.06 million, 
assuming retailers select the lower cost 
compliance option (Table 14). The 
average annualized cost associated with 
this alternative is $32.85 million. As is 
shown in the section, Supplemental 
PRIA Benefits Analysis, the present 
value of the benefits of this alternative 
is $2.2 billion if POP nutrition 
information for the major cuts is as 
successful as on-package labels in 
leading to dietary changes. The 
annualized benefit associated with this 
alternative is $205.5 million. These 
estimates are not adjusted to account for 
current compliance, thus over estimate 
costs and benefits from saved lives. 
Alternative 4: Require Nutrition 
Information on Labels of the Major Cuts 
and on All Ground or Chopped Products 
FSIS considered requiring nutrition 
information only on labels of the major 
cuts and on all other ground or chopped 
products not covered in §§ 317.344 and 
381.444.16 As in Alternative 3, 
establishments could voluntarily 
provide nutrition information, either at 
the POP or on the label, for the 
nonmajor cuts that are not ground or 
chopped. This approach allows for a 
distinction between major cuts and 
nonmajor cuts that are not ground or 
chopped. 
FSIS estimates that packages of single- 
ingredient, raw major cuts, including 
ground beef and ground pork, represent 
at a minimum 80 percent, most-likely 85 
percent, and at a maximum 90 percent 
of all packages of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products sold through 
retail stores. Therefore, FSIS estimates 
the minimum, most-likely, and 
maximum costs of this alternative 
would be the same as these percentages 
of the costs of Alternative 5, which 
requires nutrition information on the 
package labels of all major and 
nonmajor cuts sold through retail stores. 
FSIS has based these percentages on a 
previous determination by FSIS that the 
major cuts are representative of the 
market (56 FR 60307, November 27, 
1991) and are the most popular cuts (56 
FR 60320). Comments on the 1991 
nutrition labeling proposal generally 
supported the list of major cuts (58 FR 
640, January 6, 1993). Similarly, one 
comment to the January 18, 2001, 
proposed rule on nutrition labeling 
stated that the major cuts represent the 
greatest share of fresh meat 
consumption. The cost analysis of 
Alternative 5 follows this discussion. 
FSIS estimates the average present 
value of the costs of this alternative to 
be $812.99 million ($956.5 million, the 
average present value cost of Alternative 
5, × .85). The average annualized cost 
associated with this alternative is 
estimated at $90.28 million. 
The benefits of this alternative would 
be similar to those of the selected 
alternative if POP nutrition information 
and on-package labels are equally 
successful at leading to dietary change. 
The pounds of product requiring 
nutrition labeling are the same for both 
Alternatives 3 and 4. However, this 
alternative would be significantly more 
costly than the alternative chosen, 
because this alternative would require 
on-package nutrition labels on a large 
volume of product that are not required 
to bear labels under Alternative 3. 
These estimates are not adjusted to 
account for current compliance, thus 
over estimate costs and benefits from 
saved lives. 
Alternative 5: Require Nutrition Labels 
on All Single-Ingredient, Raw Meat and 
Poultry Products and on All Ground or 
Chopped Products 
FSIS considered requiring nutrition 
information on labels of major cuts and 
nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products, and on 
labels of ground or chopped products, 
unless an exemption applied. 
The supplemental PRIA cost analysis 
for the alternative chosen calculated the 
costs of requiring nutrition labels on all 
ground or chopped products. FSIS 
calculated the costs of requiring labels 
on all other major and nonmajor cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw products that are 
not ground or chopped. The same 
method for estimating the labeling cost 
for all ground and chopped products 
under the alternative chosen was used 
to estimate the labeling costs for major

17 The number of firms affected is derived by 
summing the number of large establishments, small 
establishments, and establishments of unknown 
size for each type of species in Table 7 and dividing 
by 3, the average number of establishments owned 
by a firm. 
18 The safe handling rule estimated that there 
were 15 billion retail packages of raw meat and 
poultry products (58 FR 58925). 
19 Based on information from the July 2004 
National Conference on Weights and Measures held 
in Pittsburgh, PA, FSIS estimates that 25 percent of 
retail packages of meat and poultry are products 
with added solutions. Therefore, FSIS estimates 
that 25 percent of retail packages of fresh meat and 
poultry products are multi-ingredient products for 
which nutrition labeling information is already 
required, unless an exemption applies. Thus, 75 
percent (100 percent minus 25 percent) of retail 
packages of raw meat and poultry products are 
single-ingredient products for which nutrition 
labeling information is now required, unless an 
exemption applies. 
and nonmajor cuts of single-ingredient, 
raw products under Alternative 5. 
Table 7 shows the number of Federal 
establishments producing major or 
nonmajor cuts that are not ground 
products. Many of these establishments 
have a mix of operations that fabricate 
a variety of cuts derived from multiple 
species in the same establishment. This 
is especially prevalent in small and very 
small sized establishments. Thus, the 
totals of the columns or the rows in this 
table do not represent the total number 
of establishments under Federal 
inspection due to double counting.

Note: Data is from the Performance Based Inspection System (PBIS) April 2006. 
Consistent with the supplemental 
PRIA cost analysis for the selected 
alternative, FSIS estimates that very 
small establishments would be exempt 
from nutrition labeling requirements 
because they have 500 or fewer 
employees, are owned by companies 
with 500 or fewer employees, and FSIS 
assumes they produce 100,000 pounds 
or less annually of each product. Also, 
FSIS assumes that all ‘‘small’’ 
establishments are owned by large, 
multi-establishment firms and would 
not qualify for this exemption. Nutrition 
labels are designed for company-wide 
use. FSIS estimated the number of 
affected companies by dividing the 
number of small and large 
establishments in the table above by 
three, the number of establishments 
owned on average by multi- 
establishment firms (Muth, 2003; RTI, 
2003). FSIS assumed establishments of 
unknown size are either large or small, 
to ensure that the Agency did not 
underestimate the number of affected 
establishments. 
In addition, there are about 41 State 
establishments that are small that would 
likely be affected by this rule. Little 
information is available to the Agency 
about the number of firms that represent 
the 41 State establishments. However, it 
is likely that the 41 State establishments 
are owned by 41 firms. There are no 
State establishments that are large. The 
analysis assumes that State 
establishments that are small would be 
affected. Furthermore, the Agency does 
not have data for these 41 State 
establishments on the fabrication of 
major or nonmajor cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw products. Therefore, the 
Agency may be underestimating the 
number of affected firms that own small 
or large processing establishments that 
fabricate major and nonmajor cuts. 
Thus, the final estimates of the 
number of affected firms that own small 
or large processing establishments that 
fabricate major and nonmajor cuts that 
are not ground are: 322 beef firms; 276 
pork firms; 110 lamb firms; 64 ‘‘other’’ 
meat firms, including goat processors; 
261 chicken firms; and 84 turkey 
firms.17 
To estimate the average number of cut 
products fabricated per firm, FSIS 
estimated that all firms would fabricate 
all the major cuts (except the ground 
major cuts, because FSIS has already 
accounted for those) and an additional 
3 nonmajor cuts. FSIS estimated that 
beef firms would typically fabricate 12 
major products; pork firms, 9; lamb 
firms, 6; chicken firms, 5; and turkey 
firms, 5 major products. Therefore, the 
total number of major and nonmajor 
products fabricated by beef firms is 15 
products; pork firms, 12; lamb firms, 9; 
chicken firms, 8; and turkey firms, 8. 
FSIS then assumed processors of 
‘‘other’’ meat products would fabricate 
12 products (similar to the number of 
beef or pork products). In the table 
above, the PBIS figures for beef 
processors include veal processors. For 
purposes of this analysis, FSIS 
considered the number of major beef 
cuts rather than veal cuts, because beef 
is more widely produced and consumed 
than veal. 
FSIS estimated the average, one-time 
cost to modify on-package labels for 
prepackaged meat and poultry product 
by multiplying the average per label 
modification cost ($2,274 as shown in 
the Supplemental PRIA Cost Analysis) 
by the number of affected firms and by 
the number of products per firm. Based 
on this formula and the numbers of 
firms and products shown above, the 
estimated average label modification 
costs are: beef and veal firms, $10.85 
million ($33,700/firm); pork firms, $7.44 
million ($27,000/firm); lamb firms, 
$2.22 million ($20,000/firm); other meat 
firms, 1.73 million ($27,000/firm); 
chicken firms, $4.69 million ($18,000/ 
firm); and turkey firms, $1.51 million 
($18,000/firm). The total, one-time 
average costs of designing labels would 
be $28.45 million. 
In addition to the one-time average 
costs of designing labels, companies 
will also incur costs for providing larger 
labels with nutrition information. To 
calculate this cost, FSIS estimated that 
there are 11.25 billion packages (15 
billion 18 retail packages of all raw meat 
and poultry × 75 percent 19 that are 
single-ingredient, raw packages) of 
major and nonmajor cuts sold through 
retail establishments. 
Furthermore, in the supplemental 
PRIA cost analysis for the alternative

20 Options 1 and 2 are described in the Final Rule 
Cost Analysis. 
21 A nutrition analysis is required to create a 
Nutrition Facts panel. Nutrition information is 
available from FSIS and other sources for many 
ground or chopped products, and major and 
nonmajor cuts of meat and poultry products. 
chosen, FSIS estimated that there are 
2.267 billion packages of ground or 
chopped products (see Appendix B 
Table 8). Therefore, FSIS estimates that 
there are 8.983 billion packages (11.25 
billion packages of all meat and poultry 
minus 2.267 billion packages of ground 
or chopped products) of major and 
nonmajor cuts that are not ground or 
chopped sold through retail 
establishments. 
FSIS estimates that 25 percent of 
8.893 billion packages of single- 
ingredient, raw major and nonmajor 
cuts that are not ground or chopped are 
packaged by processing establishments, 
or 2.246 billion packages (8.893 billion 
packages × 25 percent). Based on 
information collected by RTI, a blank 
label is assumed to have a minimum 
cost of $0.002; most-likely cost of 
$0.005; and a maximum cost of $0.008. 
Multiplying 2.246 billion packages by 
the annual added average cost of $0.005 
per label results in an average cost of 
approximately $11.23 million (2,246 
billion packages × $0.005 per label) 
annually. Total first-year costs (one-time 
and annual recurring) to processing 
establishments would be $39.68 million 
($28.45 million for one-time cost + 
$11.23 million annual recurring cost). 
Only retail establishments that have 
500 or more employees will be affected 
by nutrition labeling requirements for 
major and nonmajor cuts because it is 
not likely that others would produce 
100,000 pounds per single-ingredient, 
raw product. Table 4 shows that 23,479 
retail facilities are owned by companies 
that have 500 or more employees. The 
stores are owned by 266 firms. 
Retail establishments subject to the 
requirements of the rule could comply 
by either incorporating nutrition 
information on the label printed by store 
scale printer systems (option 1) or by 
applying an additional preprinted label 
with nutrition information (option 2).20 
The supplemental PRIA cost analysis for 
the Alternative chosen shows that 
option 1 is the less expensive option. 
Therefore, FSIS assumes stores would 
choose this option under Alternative 5 
as well. FSIS also assumes that, on 
average, the estimated total cost to 
upgrade printer scales to provide store- 
printed labels is $56.35 million (23,479 
retail establishments × $2,400 per 
establishment). The analysis assumes 
that scales with the added features for 
making store-printed labels are replaced 
every five years. The annual 
maintenance costs for the upgraded 
scale printer is estimated to be 6 percent 
of $2,400 or $144 every year after a scale 
printer has been purchased equal to 
$3.38 million (23,479 retail 
establishments × $144 per 
establishment). FSIS is including these 
costs here, in addition to the costs for 
nutrition labeling of ground or chopped 
products, because FSIS assumes that 
retail stores would need to have 
additional scale printers to apply labels 
to major and nonmajor cuts that are not 
ground or chopped. 
The supplemental PRIA cost analysis 
shows that for retail stores the average 
one-time cost estimates for redesigning 
labels is $0.414 million (Appendix B, 
Table 3). FSIS is including this cost here 
and in the ground or chopped products 
labeling costs to ensure that FSIS does 
not underestimate the costs of this 
alternative. 
The supplemental PRIA cost analysis 
estimates that each processor company 
produces an average of 6.6 unique 
ground or chopped products (see 
Appendix B, Table 2), that each retail 
firm and meat market firm offers an 
average of 4.6 unique ground or 
chopped products (4.6/6.6 or 69 percent 
of the number of ground or chopped 
products produced by processors), and 
that each warehouse club firm offers an 
average of 1.33 unique ground or 
chopped products (1.3/6.6 or 20 percent 
of the number of ground or chopped 
products sold by processors, (Appendix 
B, Table 9). 
Excluding ground or chopped 
products, FSIS estimates that retail and 
meat market firms package 69 percent of 
the total number or major and nonmajor 
cuts produced by establishments. 
Consequently, these firms would 
package on average 10.35 beef products, 
8.28 pork products, 6.21 lamb products, 
5.52 chicken products, 5.52 turkey 
products; and 8.28 other meat products. 
Excluding ground or chopped products, 
FSIS estimates that warehouse club 
firms package 20 percent of the total 
number of major and nonmajor cuts by 
processors. Consequently, these firms 
would package an average of 3 beef 
products, 2.4 pork products 1.8 lamb 
products, 1.6 chicken products, 1.6 
turkey products, and 2.4 other meat 
products. Therefore, FSIS estimates that 
each retail and meat market firm 
packages an average of 44.16 unique 
major and nonmajor cuts. FSIS also 
estimates that each warehouse club firm 
packages an average of 12.8 unique 
major and nonmajor cuts. 
Therefore, an average of 11,402 
unique major and nonmajor cuts will 
require nutrition labels applied in retail 
facilities ((44.16 products × 255 
supermarket, grocery store and meat 
market firms) + (12.8 products × 11 
warehouse club and superstore firms)). 
Consistent with the cost analysis of 
the chosen alternative, the average one- 
time cost to retailers affected by the rule 
for the nutrition analyses of major and 
nonmajor cuts21 is $7.87 million (11,402 
unique products × $690 average cost of 
a nutrition analysis, Appendix B, Table 
3). 
The use of larger labels is another cost 
that retail stores may incur. If retail 
stores package 75 percent of total single- 
ingredient, major and nonmajor cuts 
that are not ground or chopped, then an 
average of 6.737 billion packages (8.983 
billion packages × 75 percent) are 
packaged by retail stores annually. If the 
added average cost of each label is 
$0.005 (as assumed in the cost analysis 
for the alternative chosen), then retailers 
affected by the rule will incur an added 
average annual cost of about $33.68 
million. 
A summary of the frequency of 
various labeling costs for single- 
ingredient, raw products for Alternative 
5 are shown in Table 8. A summary of 
the costs for Alternative 5 are shown in 
Table 9 and in Appendix D. 
Alternative 5 is the most expensive 
alternative that FSIS considered. This 
alternative would require labels on a 
larger volume of product than would 
Alternative 4. As with Alternative 4, 
this alternative would require labels on 
a large volume of product not currently 
required to bear labels.

The benefits of this alternative are 
comparable to the alternative chosen

alternative and on the condition that 
POP nutrition information is equally as 
successful as on-package labels in 
leading to dietary change. 
Summary Comparison of Regulatory 
Alternatives 
The Analysis of Alternatives section 
provides an in-depth comparison of the 
regulatory alternatives, including a cost- 
effectiveness analysis. This comparison 
takes into account the relative success of 
POP nutrition information compared to 
on-package nutrition information labels, 
and the cost of each measure (form in 
which nutrition information is 
provided) for the products affected. The 
discussion of cost-effectiveness centers 
on Tables 26–29. 
D. Costs and Benefit of the 
Supplemental Proposed Rule 
1. Supplemental PRIA Cost Analysis 
FSIS analysis of this rule includes 
many of the same assumptions that were 
used in the proposed rule. In most 
cases, FSIS believes that the initial 
assumptions are still valid. No new data 
has been presented refining or disputing 
these original assumptions. However, in 
other cases FSIS and RTI were able, 
based upon more current information, to 
change and improve the original 
assumptions. 
PRIA vs. supplemental PRIA: The 
PRIA estimated the costs of nutrition 
labels based on the cost analysis 
conducted for the ‘‘Mandatory Safe 
Handling Statements on Labeling of 
Raw Meat and Poultry Products’’ 
proposed rule published November 4, 
1993 (58 FR 58922). In the PRIA, FSIS 
adjusted the costs of the safe handling 
rule to reflect the costs related to the 
volume of ground or chopped products 
produced. For fixed costs associated 
with nutrition labeling of ground or 
chopped products, FSIS assumed that 
80 percent of the estimated fixed costs 
were already incurred by retailers and 
processors, and only 20 percent of the 
estimated fixed costs would be required 
for compliance with the proposed rule. 
Therefore, FSIS estimated the fixed 
costs for the nutrition labeling of ground 
or chopped products would total 20 
percent of the estimated fixed safe 
handling labeling costs: $10 million to 
$20 million for processors and $28.8 
million to $43.2 million for retailers (66 
FR 4986, January 18, 2001). 
The estimates of operating costs to 
retail establishments in the PRIA are 
based on the number of packages of 
ground or chopped products that would 
be sold through small and large retail 
stores and the labeling costs per package 
based on the safe handling labeling 
costs. FSIS multiplied the estimated

22 The impacts of a 68 percent compliance rate for 
nutrition labeling of ground or chopped products 
(NCBA, 2004) and a 54.8 percent compliance rate 
for major cuts (USDA, 1999) will be discussed at the 
conclusion of this section. 
number of ground or chopped products 
sold through large retail stores by the 
safe handling label cost for large retail 
stores to derive an estimate of $6 
million in annual operating costs for 
these stores. Similarly, FSIS multiplied 
the estimated number of packages of 
ground or chopped products sold 
through small retail stores by the safe 
handling label costs for small retail 
stores to derive an annual estimate of $4 
million in costs for these establishments 
(66 FR 4988, January 18, 2001). FSIS 
explained that these operating costs 
would increase by $2 million to $12 
million in current prices. FSIS also 
estimated the labor costs of small firms 
applying a separate nutrition label 
would be $.6 million, based on safe 
handling label costs (66 FR 4988, 
January 18, 2001). FSIS assumed 
processors would incur no additional 
operating costs associated with nutrition 
labeling ground or chopped products. 
FSIS also estimated one-time 
paperwork burden costs for nutrition 
labels on ground or chopped products of 
$8.8 million. These paperwork burden 
costs were the estimated costs of label 
development, recordkeeping, and the 
costs of submitting label approval 
applications to FSIS (66 FR 4988, 
January 18, 2001). 
Finally, FSIS estimated that the 
average time for each retail 
establishment to obtain POP materials 
that include nutrition information for 
the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products would be 30 
minutes. Based on labor costs of $20 per 
hour, FSIS estimated that total retail 
costs for obtaining these materials 
would be $0.7 million. (66 FR 4985– 
4986, January 18, 2001). The PRIA did 
not estimate any other costs associated 
with retailers obtaining or maintaining 
POP materials. 
The revisions in the supplemental 
PRIA are based on additional 
information available to FSIS, improved 
analytical methods, and a more accurate 
characterization of the impacts of the 
rule. FSIS revised the supplemental 
PRIA in response to concerns expressed 
during the Interagency review of the 
PRIA about data quality and in response 
to final guidelines issued by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB, 2002) 
to Federal Agencies after publication of 
the proposed rule. 
The supplemental PRIA assumes that 
no establishment or retail facility has 
incurred any costs associated with the 
requirements of this regulation prior to 
its effective date, even though many 
firms have already been providing the 
information that is being required.22 
Rather than prorate cost estimates in the 
safe handling rule based on the volume 
of ground or chopped products, the 
supplemental PRIA includes estimates 
for itemized costs that pertain 
specifically to nutrition labels. For 
processing firms, these costs in the 
supplemental PRIA include 
administrative costs, graphic design 
costs, prepress activities costs, plate 
engraving costs, nutrition analysis costs, 
and the costs of larger labels. 
The supplemental PRIA explains that 
if retail firms choose to use store scale- 
printers to print nutrition labels for 
ground or chopped products, costs to 
these retailers would include upgrading 
store scales-printers to include nutrition 
information, redesigning larger store 
labels, providing a nutrition analysis for 
each product, and using larger labels. 
This method of labeling is referred to as 
‘‘Option 1’’ in the analysis. If retail firms 
choose to apply an additional 
preprinted label with nutrition 
information to ground or chopped 
products, the cost to these retail stores 
would include designing a one-color 
nutrition label, conducting a nutrition 
analysis for each product, and 
purchasing and applying a separate 
label on packages of ground or chopped 
product at the retail level. This method 
of labeling is referred to as ‘‘Option 2’’ 
in the analysis. 
The supplemental PRIA assumes that 
labels will be redesigned for company- 
wide use. The supplemental PRIA also 
assumes that small and large plants are 
owned by large, multi-firm 
establishments. In addition, the 
supplemental PRIA assumes that retail 
stores or chains with fewer than 500 
employees produce 100,000 pounds or 
less annually of each ground or chopped 
product and are exempt from the 
nutrition labeling requirements for 
ground or chopped products. In the 
supplemental PRIA, the average 
material and labor cost for POP placards 
have been revised. 
The benefits analysis is revised from 
the PRIA to reflect a constant value for 
each premature death prevented by the 
requirements of the rule to update cost 
to 2002 dollars. The value of preventing 
a premature death varied on the basis of 
age in the benefits analysis of the PRIA. 
Because of these changes, the benefits in 
the supplemental PRIA are higher than 
those of the PRIA.

24 Flexography printing is frequently used for 
printing on plastic foil, acetate film, and other 
material used in packaging. Flexography uses 
flexible printing plates made of rubber or plastic. 
The inked plates with a slightly raised image are 
rotated on a cylinder which transfers the image to 
the substrate. Flexography uses fast-drying inks, is 
a high-speed print process, can print on many types 
of absorbent and non-absorbent materials, and can 
print continuous papers such as gift wrap and 
wallpaper.

The supplemental proposed rule 
would require nutrition labels on all 
ground or chopped products, with or 
without added seasonings, unless an 
exemption applies, and would make the 
voluntary nutrition labeling program 
mandatory for major cuts, unless an 
exemption applies. 
The cost analysis of the requirements 
for ground or chopped products is based 
on the FDA Labeling Cost Model 
developed by RTI, the Enhanced 
Facilities Data Base (EFD), Performance 
Based Inspection System (PBIS), the 
FSIS Performance Based Inspection 
System database, AC Nielsen Purchase 
Data of 2003, and Information Resources 
Inc. (IRI). The PBIS provides estimates 
of the number of very small, small, and 
large processing establishments that 
grind meat and poultry products. IRI 
scanner data and AC Nielsen Purchase 
Data provide estimates of the number of 
ground or chopped products produced 
by processing establishments. 
Supplemental Proposed Rule Cost 
Estimates for Major Cuts 
For the major cuts, FSIS assumes that 
retailers will comply by using POP 
placards. The number of retail 
establishments affected by the nutrition 
labeling requirements for the major cuts 
is based on 2002 data from the Bureau 
of the Census (Table 3).23 The Census 
data are consistent with the 
establishment numbers used in the 
analysis of nutrition labeling of ground 
or chopped products used in the PRIA. 
The number of retail establishments 
used in the supplemental PRIA is 
74,910 (owned by 47,688 firms) 
compared to 69,500 (comprised of 
supermarkets, other stores, and 
wholesale clubs) used in the PRIA (66 
FR 4982, January 18, 2001). The use of 
the 2002 Bureau of Census data instead 
of FMI data (from the PRIA) results in 
a higher estimated cost of the POP 
requirements in the supplemental 
proposed rule. The supplemental PRIA’s 
estimate is also higher than the PRIA’s 
estimate because in the PRIA, FSIS 
assumed retail facilities would incur 
labor costs only and would not purchase 
frames and placards. 
The cost of three nutrition 
information placards for displaying POP 
information for the major cuts is 
estimated to be $65.17 per store ($28.00 
for placards and $37.17 for metal 
frames), based on information from the 
Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and 
http://www.hubert.com. Placards will be 
replaced every two years because of 
normal wear and tear. The supplemental 
PRIA estimates that an average of 0.5 
hour at labor cost of $21.11 per hour, 
per store is the amount of time 
necessary to obtain and make available 
the POP materials, insert the placards or 
posters into frames, and post the 
information in the store. The average 
labor cost is then $10.16 ($21.11 × 0.5). 
The total average cost per store is then 
$75.73. 
The average total cost of purchasing 
and installing posters or placards will 
be $5.67 million the first year and every 
other year after that ((74,910 
establishments × $21.11 per hour × .5 
hours) + (74,910 establishments × 
$65.17 per establishment)). The present 
value of this cost is $31.07 million when 
discounted at 7 percent over 20 years. 
Supplemental Proposed Rule Cost 
Estimates for Ground or Chopped 
Product 
Should this rule become final, both 
meat and poultry processing firms and 
retail establishments will incur 
compliance costs associated with 
nutrition labeling of ground or chopped 
products for such items as label 
redesign, nutrition analysis, larger 
labels, and upgrading store scale- 
printers. The following discussion 
presents the costs associated with 
nutrition labeling ground or chopped 
products for meat and poultry 
processing firms and for retail firms. 
Meat and Poultry Processing Firms 
The cost of nutrition labeling of 
ground or chopped products packaged 
by processing establishments is 
comprised of costs for redesigning 
preprinted product labels that will 
include a nutrition label (one-time cost), 
for conducting nutrition analysis on 
products to obtain information for the 
nutrition label (one-time cost), and for 
using larger labels that would be needed 
for the former product labels (recurring 
cost). 
Based on an examination of labels 
applied to ground or chopped products 
that are labeled at processing 
establishments, the most common 
printing method for these labels is 
flexography.24 Nutrition facts are 
typically printed in one color. The per- 
label modification estimated midpoint 
cost, in 2005 dollars, for a one-color 
change using the flexography printing 
method is $2,247. The estimated 
minimum cost is $1,528, and the 
maximum cost is $3,170. Cost depends 
upon the complexity of the label design 
(Table 12). These estimates reflect 
administrative, graphic design, prepress 
activities, plate engraving costs, and 
nutrition analysis. The paperwork costs 
are included in the administrative costs. 
FSIS assumes that the paperwork costs 
are about 14 percent of the midpoint 
estimate administrative costs. Thus, the 
midpoint estimate of the paperwork 
burden costs would be $44.66 ($319 × 
14 percent) per label modification. The 
estimated total per label design 
modification cost ranges from a low of 
$929 to a high of $2,383 with a 
midpoint of $1,557.

2 RTI assumed that the cost for nutrition analysis would be the cost associated with analysis required to create a Nutrition Facts panel. Source: 
RTI, 2003, P.7. 
Although nutrition information for 
some ground products will be available 
from the USDA National Nutrient 
Database for Standard Reference (USDA, 
Agricultural Research Service, 2005) or 
other low-cost sources, in many cases, 
the regulations would require that 
companies conduct a separate nutrition 
analysis for ground or chopped products 
for which the USDA National Nutrient 
Database for Standard Reference or 
other sources have not provided 
nutrition information. Because of the 
large variety of ground product 
formulations, many products will not 
likely be the same or similar enough to 
the products for which the USDA 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference or other sources provide 
nutrition information. Because FSIS 
could not identify the number of ground 
or chopped products that would require 
a separate nutrition analysis versus the 
number of products for which the USDA 
National Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference or other sources supply 
complete nutrition information, FSIS 
estimated a one-time nutrition analysis 
cost for all ground or chopped products. 
The per-label cost of this analysis is in 
the range of $599 and $787, with an 
average of $690. On average, the Agency 
assumed that total label design will be 
$1,557, and a nutrition analysis will be 
$690. 
Nutrition labels are designed for 
company-wide use. The number of 
affected companies is estimated by 
dividing the number of small and large 
establishments in Table 1 by three, the 
number of establishments owned on 
average by multi-establishment firms 
(Muth, 2003; See RTI analysis). Thus, 
the final estimate of the number of 
affected firms that own small or large 
Federal processing establishments that 
grind meat is 322 ((858 small processing 
establishments + 109 large processing 
establishments)/3). For the purposes of 
this analysis, very small establishments 
are considered to be exempt from the 
requirements for nutrition labeling of 
ground or chopped products because 
FSIS assumes they have fewer than 500 
employees, are owned by companies 
with fewer than 500 employees, and 
FSIS assumes they produce 100,000 
pounds or less annually of each ground 
product. The PBIS database does not 
include data on size of the owning 
company or processed product volumes. 
Thus, the total number of 
establishments affected by the rule for 
this analysis may be overestimated. In 
addition, this analysis includes 41 State 
establishments/firms that are small- 
sized. These firms were identified in 
PBIS database as having grinding 
operations that would produce ground 
or chopped products. 
AC Nielsen Food Purchase data from 
2003 and Information Resources Inc. 
(IRI) were used to identify ground meat 
and poultry products with or without 
added seasonings. The purchase data 
include data for frozen and fresh, 
ground or chopped products affected by 
the final nutrition labeling rule. The 
information shows that an average of 3.3 
frozen ground meat or poultry products 
are produced by companies that grind 
meat and poultry. The data were then 
scaled to account for the total number 
of ground or chopped products by 
assuming that a typical company 
produces an equal number of fresh and 
frozen ground meat or poultry products. 
Therefore, multiplying 3.3 × 2 results in 
an average of 6.6 products per firm and 
2,396 unique meat and poultry products 
(6.6 × 363 firms) that are subject to the 
labeling requirements of the rule. 
The one-time, average cost for meat 
and poultry establishments to modify 
product labels on prepackaged ground 
meat and poultry products to include 
nutrition information at processing 
establishments is estimated at $5.38 
million ($2,247 mid-point per label 
modification costs × 363 affected 
companies × 6.6 affected products per 
company). The average present value of 
this one time cost discounted over 20 
years at 7 percent is $5.03 million. 
In addition to the one-time costs of 
designing labels, companies will also 
incur costs for providing larger labels. 
The cost of larger labels was obtained by 
estimating the volume of ground meat 
and poultry products packaged by 
processors and multiplying the results 
by the incremental cost of larger labels. 
The cost of applying larger labels is 
assumed to be the same as the cost of 
applying smaller labels. 
The NCBA’s Meat Purchase Diary 
(RTI, 2003) indicates that an average 
American household purchases 49.3 
pounds of raw ground beef annually 
from retail stores. Based on 112.0 
million households in the United States 
(U.S. Department of Commerce, 2003), 
5.5216 billion pounds (49.3 pounds per 
household × 112 million households) of 
ground beef are purchased from retail 
stores annually. The American Meat 
Institute estimates that 0.123 pounds of 
other ground meat and poultry products 
are consumed for every pound of 
ground beef. Consequently, an estimated 
6.201 billion pounds of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry (5.5216 
billion pounds × 1.123 scale factor) are 
purchased by consumers annually (66 
FR 4987, January 18, 2001). 
According to the NCBA, the average 
weight of a retail package is 2.735 
pounds, with a distribution of 1.17 
pounds at the 5th percentile and 4.35 
pounds at the 95th percentile 
(McGowan, 2003). Dividing 6.201 
billion pounds by 2.735 pounds per 
package yields an average of 2.267 
billion packages of ground or chopped 
products sold at retail stores annually. 
To determine the total number of 
packages sold at ‘‘exempt’’

67772 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
25 Based upon a communication between 
Warranty Department, Hobart Corporation, Troy, 
Ohio, and Gary Becker, USDA, FSIS, September 4, 
2003, and a second communication between Sales 
Department, Hobart Corporation, Beltsville, 
Maryland, and Gary Becker, USDA, FSIS, 
September 4, 2003. The suggested retail price for a 
Quantum scale-printer is between $5,500 and 
$6,000. A one-year maintenance agreement would 
cost about $355. Therefore, it has been estimated 
that operating and maintenance costs would be 
about six percent of the purchase price annually 
($355/$5,750 = 6%). 
26 It is possible that as new scale-printer systems 
are developed that the cost of including the added 
feature to new scale-printer systems may be less 
than $1,600 per scale. But to assume, as RTI 
reported, that there is no additional cost for these 
added features in the future results in an 
underestimate of the compliance costs. 
27 Package redesign varies depending upon what 
must be changed on the current label. Therefore, 
three estimates have been provided. 
28 Each store visited by RTI was owned by a 
different company and included medium and large 
sized stores. No meat markets were visited because 
RTI believed that no meat markets owned by 
companies large enough to be affected by the 
labeling requirements are located in the Raleigh- 
Durham area. 
29 Numbers are rounded. 
establishments, the Agency, using U.S. 
Census 2002 data, FSIS found that 79.3 
percent of total dollar sales by 
supermarkets, meat markets, and 
warehouse stores were sold by 
establishments owned by large retail 
firms and establishments (500 or more 
employees). These large retail firms and 
establishments (266) represent 0.006 of 
the total number of retail firms and 
establishments (47,688) affected by the 
rule as shown in Tables 4 and 5 above. 
Assuming that the percentage of total 
dollar sales is similar to sales for ground 
meat and poultry products, about 1.798 
billion packages (2.267 billion packages 
× .793) of ground or chopped products 
are sold each year by nonexempt 
processing establishment and retail 
establishments. 
Finally, a study conducted by NCBA, 
found that less than 25 percent of 
ground products are packaged by 
processing establishment (Dopp, 2001). 
Thus the Agency estimates that at most 
566.75 million packages of ground or 
chopped products are packaged by 
processing establishments each year 
(2.267 billion packages × .25). 
The Agency assumes that a larger 
label will cost an additional $0.005 per 
label, on average. This estimate was 
based on information from the FDA 
Labeling Cost Model (Muth, et al. 2003), 
where $0.005 was the difference in cost 
between the low and high cost estimates 
for pressure-sensitive labels. This 
estimate was evaluated by Hobart, a 
label manufacturer, who believed that it 
was reasonable (Schuller, 2003). 
Multiplying 566.75 million packages by 
the annual added cost of $0.005 per 
label results in an added cost of 
approximately $2.83 million, annually. 
The present value of these annual costs 
discounted at 7 percent is $30.02 
million. 
Retail Firms 
The cost of nutrition labeling would 
also affect retail stores. But because of 
the small business exemption, fewer 
retail stores are affected by the 
requirements for ground and chopped 
products than the 74,910 establishments 
shown in Table 3. Using U.S. 2002 
Census data shown earlier in Table 4, a 
total of 23,479 stores will be affected. 
Table 4 shows the number of retail 
stores that are owned by companies 
with more than 500 employees. FSIS 
assumes that stores or chains with 500 
or fewer employees produce 100,000 
pounds or less annually of each ground 
or chopped product and are, therefore, 
exempt from the nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products. 
Should the rule become final, retail 
establishments subject to the 
requirements of the rule may comply by 
either incorporating nutrition 
information on the label printed by store 
scale printer systems (Option 1) or by 
applying an additional preprinted label 
with nutrition information (Option 2). 
The cost of store-printed labels includes 
upgrading store scale-printers to include 
nutrition information, redesigning larger 
store labels, providing a nutrition 
analysis for each product, and using 
larger labels. Based on information from 
NCBA and FMI (Amstein, 2003) many 
scale-printers in retail establishments do 
not have the capability to print nutrition 
information on store-generated labels 
without an upgrade of memory capacity 
and software and either new printers or 
new printer heads. Based on a pilot 
study conducted by King Marketing 
Services, Inc., for the NCBA, the average 
cost to upgrade a scale-printer system in 
their study was $1,600 (Amstein, 2003). 
FSIS assumes that, on average, retail 
stores have 1.5 scales in their meat 
departments. Thus the total cost for 
upgrading printer-scale systems is 
assumed to be about $2,400 per store 
($1,600 per printer × 1.5 printers). The 
total average cost to upgrade printer 
scales to provide store-printed labels for 
ground or chopped products is 
estimated at $56.35 million (23,749 
retail establishments × $2,400 per 
establishment). The analysis assumes 
that scales with the added features for 
making store-printed labels are replaced 
every five years. The annual 
maintenance costs for an upgraded 
scale-printer is estimated to be 6 percent 
of $2,400 or $144 ($2,400 × .06) every 
year after a scale-printer has been 
purchased.25 26 
The cost of redesigning larger store 
logo labels to be used with the scale- 
printer systems was based upon cost 
data from the FDA Labeling Cost Model 
and Census data on the number of large 
companies that own retail 
establishments. As for preprinted labels, 
flexography is the most common 
printing method for the store logo labels 
used with scale printer systems. The 
cost to make a one-color label redesign 
change depending on the complexity of 
the label redesign ranges from a 
minimum of $929, an average of $1,557, 
and a maximum of $2,383, as shown in 
Table 12.27 Because each company will 
need to redesign only one label, the 
average cost was multiplied by the 266 
firms affected by the rule. The average 
one-time cost estimates for redesigning 
labels is $0.414 million ($1,557 per label 
design × 266 firms). The average one- 
time cost estimate for the paperwork 
costs (average regulatory affairs costs of 
$319 × 14 percent = $44.50) of 
redesigning labels is $11,837 ($44.50 × 
266 firms). As with products packaged 
by processors, label redesign can not 
simply be incorporated into the normal 
label redesign process because it is a 
fundamental change in the label format. 
Once the label is redesigned, the costs 
of subsequent label redesigns will not be 
affected substantially. 
To estimate the cost of conducting 
nutrition analysis for ground or 
chopped products packaged by retailers, 
the number of unique products was 
estimated. It was assumed that each firm 
(or parent company) would conduct a 
nutrition analysis once for each unique 
product, which might be sold in some 
or all of their retail facilities. The 
number of firms shown in Table 4 was 
multiplied by an average number of 
store-brand products packaged at each 
store. To estimate the average number of 
ground or chopped products packaged 
at retail, the number of ground or 
chopped products with store-applied 
packaging at six different grocery stores 
and three wholesale clubs was 
counted.28 This analysis showed that 
grocery stores sell an average of 4.57 
ground or chopped products and 
warehouse stores sell an average of 1.33 
ground or chopped products packaged 
at the store. Multiplying 4.57 by the 
total number of grocery store firms and 
meat market firms and multiplying 1.33 
by the total number of warehouse club 
firms in Table 4 results in 1,180 ((4.57 
products × 255 grocery store and meat 
market firms) + (1.33 × 11 warehouse 
club firms))29 unique products that will

30 The Agency assumed an average cost of $0.005 
per label for a larger label because it represents the 
change in cost between low, midpoint, and high 
cost estimates for pressure-sensitive labels in the 
FDA Labeling Cost Model (Appendix B). The 
differences in the low, midpoint, and high cost 
estimates derive primarily from the differences in 
the size of labels. Second, a representative from 
Hobart, which manufactures labels, says that $0.005 
was a reasonable estimate for the added cost of a 
larger label for including nutrition facts. 
31 The Agency estimated the low, mid-point, and 
high per-unit cost for purchasing and applying one- 
color pressure-sensitive labels in 2005 dollars to be 
$0.016, $0.0293, and $0.042, respectively. 
32 The FSIS analysis which takes into account the 
uncertainty associated with various cost factors 
shows that the values at the 5th and 95th 
percentiles for this average present value using a 7 
percent discount rate and 20 year time horizon are 
$282.88 and $474.79 million, respectively. See 
Appendix D, Table 1. 
33 The FSIS analysis which takes into account the 
uncertainty associated with various cost factors 
shows that the values at the 5th and 95th 
percentiles for this average present value using a 3 
percent discount rate and 20 year time horizon are 
$380.76 and $650.23 million, respectively. See 
Appendix D, Table 1. 
require nutrition labels applied in retail 
stores. FSIS recognizes that a survey of 
six grocery stores and three wholesale 
clubs in one U.S. city is not a nationally 
representative survey. Because of 
limited time and Agency resources, 
information from this survey provided 
the best available data for FSIS’s 
estimates. Although this is a significant 
area of uncertainty in the cost analysis, 
FSIS believes these data allow for 
reasonable estimates of the costs to 
retailers. 
Using the cost of a nutrition analysis 
shown in Table 12 above, and the 
number of unique products that will 
require nutrition labels applied in retail 
stores the average cost estimate is $2.65 
million ($2,247 × 1,180 unique 
products). 
The use of larger labels is another cost 
that retail stores may incur should the 
rule become final. The cost of larger 
labels is the product of the number of 
packages of ground or chopped products 
sold in retail establishments and the 
cost of using a larger label. Earlier in the 
analysis, it was estimated that about 25 
percent of approximately 2.267 billion 
packages or about 566.79 million 
packages of ground or chopped products 
are packaged by processing 
establishments each year. If the 
remaining 75 percent of total package 
volume of ground or chopped products 
is packaged at retail stores, then 1.700 
billion packages (2.267 billion × .75) are 
packaged by retail stores annually. If the 
added average cost of each label is 
$0.005, then retail stores will incur an 
added cost of about $8.5 million (1.7 
billion packages × $0.005).30 
FSIS estimates that based on the 
analysis described above, the resulting 
average present value of one-time costs 
of upgrading scale-printer systems, 
added annual operating and 
maintenance costs for the scale-printer 
systems, one-time costs for redesigning 
larger store labels, one-time costs for 
conducting nutrition analysis, and 
present value costs for using a larger 
label will be about $209.43 million 
discounted at 7 percent. 
The cost of the second method of 
complying with the labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products at retail stores (Option 2) 
includes designing a one-color nutrition 
label, conducting a nutrition analysis for 
each product, and purchasing and 
applying a separate label on packages of 
ground or chopped products applied at 
the retail level. Using the same 
methodology that was described earlier, 
it is estimated that 1,180 unique 
products will be required to have 
nutrition labels applied in retail stores. 
Multiplying the number of unique 
products by the average per-label 
redesign and nutrition analysis costs 
(the cost of flexography is $2,470), 
results in a one-time cost estimate of 
$2.65 million (1,180 unique products × 
$2,247 per label design). 
To estimate the cost of purchasing 
and applying labels to packages of 
ground or chopped products packaged 
at retail, the per-unit cost estimates from 
the FDA Labeling Cost Model were 
multiplied by the volume of packages 
described earlier.31 FSIS estimates the 
annual cost using the average cost of 
$0.0293 per label applied. The 
estimated annual cost is $49.77 million 
($0.0293 per label and application cost 
× 1.452 billion retail packages). All of 
these costs will be incurred by large and 
small businesses. The present value of 
these costs is $452.83 million when 
discounted at 7 percent. 
Percentage Lean/Percentage Fat 
Labeling 
In the PRIA, FSIS assumed that the 
cost per label to provide information 
regarding percent lean/percent fat 
would be comparable to those costs for 
nutrition labeling, $0.0025 to $0.05 per 
label, if that information was included 
as part of the price label and $0.01 per 
label if producers developed separate 
percent fat/percent lean labels. Based on 
the National Cattleman’s Beef 
Association National Meat Case Study 
in 2004, approximately 25 percent of 
ground beef package labels surveyed 
had statements of the lean percentage of 
the packaged products but did not have 
nutrition facts panels. Therefore, FSIS 
assumed that many small businesses 
may currently include a statement of the 
lean percentage on the label of ground 
products but may not include nutrition 
facts panels on the product label. Based 
on this assumption, FSIS concluded that 
requiring small businesses that use the 
lean percentage and fat percentage 
statement on the label of ground 
products to also include nutrition 
information on the label of such 
products may result in significant 
expenses for small businesses. An 
additional 47,422 small businesses with 
an additional 51,431 retail 
establishments (stores) (see Table 5) 
may be affected. Based on the FSIS cost 
model (see Appendix B), this may 
increase the present value (7 percent) of 
average expenses for small businesses 
by about $394.16 million or by about 
$37.21 million when annualized (7 
percent). Therefore, in this 
supplemental proposed rule, small 
businesses that use statements of 
percent fat and percent lean on the label 
or in labeling of ground products will be 
exempt from nutrition labeling 
requirements, provided they include no 
other nutrition claims or nutrition 
information on the product labels or 
labeling. FSIS is taking this action, 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 604(a)(5), to 
minimize the significant impact of the 
regulation on small and very small 
establishments and small retailers. By 
taking this action, many of these small 
businesses will not be affected by this 
rule at all. 
Summary of Cost Estimates 
FSIS estimates that the average 
present value of the compliance costs 
associated with the provisions of the 
supplemental proposed rule for retail 
and processing establishments is 
$348.06 million discounted at 7 
percent,32 or $472.23 million 
discounted at 3 percent 33 (see tables 13 
and 14). The average annualized costs 
are $32.85 million and $31.74 million, 
based on a 7 percent and 3 percent 
discount rate, respectively. These 
estimates are based on the assumption 
that retail stores will choose the less 
costly of the two options which would 
be to upgrade their scale-printer 
systems, redesign larger store labels, 
conduct a nutrition analysis, and use 
larger labels. If these retail 
establishments choose the more costly 
option, the average present value cost to 
retail processing establishments could 
be as high as $599.64 million, 
discounted at 7 percent and $838.40 
million, discounted at 3 percent. 
The average present value cost of the 
supplemental proposed rule for retail 
establishments under option 1 would be

$312.77 million using a 7 percent 
discount rate and $424.53 million using 
a 3 percent rate. However, under Option 
2, the average present value cost to retail 
establishments could be $564.36 million 
discounted at 7 percent and $790.70 
million discounted at 3 percent. 
Processing establishments will incur 
the smallest portion of the cost 
increases. FSIS expects average present 
value costs to processing establishments 
costs to be $35.28 million discounted at 
7 percent and $47.70 million discounted 
at 3 percent.

34 The FSIS analysis which takes into account the 
uncertainty associated with various cost factors 
shows that the values at the 5th and 95th 
percentiles for this average present value using a 7 
percent discount rate and 20 year time horizon are 
$94.72 and $155.97 million, respectively. The 
values at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the present 
value cost distribution using a 3 percent discount 
rate are $127.63 and $213.60 million, respectively. 
See Appendix D, Table 1.

The average cost increases that FSIS 
has identified are higher than those 
estimated by RTI in their revised final 
report to FSIS. RTI had estimated the 
present value cost to be $159.0 million 
discounted at 7 percent under Option 1. 
RTI had also estimated the present value 
cost to be $396.7 million discounted at 
7 percent under Option 2. The FSIS 
estimates are higher than the RTI 
estimates because FSIS believes that 
scale-printers will have to be replaced 
periodically since they have a limited 
useful life. This equipment will also 
have to be maintained on a periodic 
basis. In addition, the costs are higher 
because the costs were updated to 
reflect 2005 costs instead of 2003 costs. 
Also, the U.S. Census 2002 data was 
used that indicated that there are more 
stores selling food products. 
Impacts of Exemptions and Existing 
Compliance on Costs 
FSIS did not reduce the compliance 
costs of the supplemental proposed rule 
to take into account the level of 
voluntary compliance with the nutrition 
labeling requirements for ground or 
chopped products that currently exists. 
Consequently, the estimated compliance 
costs for providing nutrition labeling of 
ground or chopped products are 
overstated. However, Appendix C, 
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 show the 
estimated costs which take into account 
a 68 percent compliance rate (NCBA, 
2004) of voluntary nutrition labeling of 
ground or chopped products that is 
currently assumed to exist. 
FSIS estimated the costs to all 
retailers of obtaining and displaying 
POP information for major cuts. FSIS 
did not take into account the existing 
level of compliance with the voluntary 
guidelines for nutrition labeling of 
major cuts. Consequently, the estimated 
compliance costs for providing POP 
nutrition information are also 
overstated. The impacts of a 54.8 
percent level of voluntary compliance 
(USDA, 1999) of stores that provide 
nutrition labeling for major cuts are, 
however, shown in Appendix C, Tables 
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
Appendix D, Table 1 provides a 
summary of the present value costs of 
the rule after taking into account the 
levels of voluntary compliance that are 
currently assumed to exist. The average 
present value costs of the rule decline 
to $115.45 million and $156.72 million 
when using a 7 percent and 3 percent 
discount rate, respectively.34 
Impact on Estimated Costs 
The estimates of the total 
undiscounted compliance costs of the 
final requirements for ground or 
chopped product and POP requirements 
for major cuts are $583.81 million under 
Option 1. The average present value cost 
is $348.06 million at 7 percent, with all 
but $31.07 million attributed to the 
labeling costs for ground or chopped 
product. The average annualized cost of 
the supplemental proposed rule for 
ground or chopped product, using the 
same 7 percent discount rate, is $32.85 
million. This cost is not significant 
relative to the volume of output of 
ground or chopped products sold at 
retail. For example, as noted earlier, the 
annual volume of these products sold at 
retail stores is estimated at 6.2 billion 
pounds. Therefore the annualized cost 
of the supplemental proposed rule per 
pound of ground or chopped product is 
$0.0053 ($32.85 million/6.2 billion 
pounds). Viewed another way, it was 
estimated earlier that the average weight 
of a retail package was 2.735 pounds. 
Therefore the annualized average cost of 
the supplemental proposed rule on a per 
package basis is $0.014 ($0.0053 per 
pound × 2.735 pounds per package). 
This increase compares to a price for 
ground beef that can easily exceed $2.00 
per pound or over $5.00 for an average- 
size package. 
Should the rule become final, FSIS 
believes that the compliance costs of the 
rule largely will be passed on to 
consumers in the form of higher product 
prices because the demand for meat and 
poultry products is inelastic. Huang 
(1993) analyzed a group of meats and 
other animal proteins consisting of 
products including beef and veal, pork, 
other meats, chicken, turkey, fresh and 
frozen fish, canned and cured fish, eggs, 
and cheese. He concluded that the price 
elasticity of demand for this group of 
products was (¥0.3611), i.e., a one 
percent increase in price for one of these 
products would reduce demand by only 
0.3611 percent. 
Review of about a dozen recent 
studies annotated by William Hahn 
(1996) of the Economic Research Service 
reveals that estimates of price elasticity 
of demand for most beef products 
(ground beef, steak, chuck roast, etc.) is 
less than one. Consequently, consumers 
are unlikely to reduce their demand for 
beef, ground meat products, etc., 
significantly when beef prices increase 
a few pennies per pound. Some 
consumers may demand labeled 
products, even at a higher cost per 
pound, given the value of the 
information from a diet/health 
perspective. 
2. Supplemental Proposed Rule Benefit 
Analysis 
Research Findings 
FSIS conducted an extensive search of 
research on the impacts of nutrition 
labeling and consulted with the 
Economics Research Service, USDA on 
the estimation of benefits. FSIS has 
found that there are a limited number of 
nationally representative studies on the 
effect of nutrition label and POP 
nutrition information use on dietary 
intakes. In these studies, the authors 
frequently examine consumer behavior 
before and after a significant change in 
the availability of nutrition labeling 
information (e.g., Nutrition Labeling and 
Education Act (NLEA) implementation 
and relaxation on the prohibition of 
health claims). The general conclusion 
of the available research is that there is 
a positive relationship between the 
availability of nutrition information and 
improvements in diet quality.

67776 Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 242 / Friday, December 18, 2009 / Proposed Rules 
Research by Kim, et al. used USDA’s 
Continuing Survey of Food Intake by 
Individuals, 1994–96 (CSFII) and the 
associated Diet Health Knowledge 
Survey (DHKS) to evaluate the impact of 
nutrition labels required by the NLEA 
on consumer label use and intake of 
selected nutrients. They used an 
econometric model to evaluate the 
effects of nutrition label usage by 
comparing the nutrient intake of label 
users with the expected intake of the 
label user in the absence of labels. For 
those who use nutrition facts 
information, the intake of calories from 
total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and 
sodium decreases by 6.9 percent, 2.1 
percent, 67.6 mg, and 29.58 mg 
respectively. 
However, measuring the effectiveness 
of nutrition labels on dietary intake is 
complicated by the relationship 
between label reading and other factors 
that also affect diet. For example, 
consumers with high levels of 
knowledge and concern about nutrition 
are likely to eat a healthier diet than 
consumers who are less concerned 
about nutrition; they are also more 
likely to read labels and use labels to 
guide their diet. A recent study Variyam 
(2008) uses the same dataset as Kim et 
al. (2000) and finds that the labels 
increase only fiber and iron intakes of 
label users compared with label 
nonusers. The author notes that in 
comparison, a model that does not 
account for self-selection implies 
significant label effects for all but two of 
the 13 nutrients that are listed on the 
NFP. Below we provide some 
information from other studies that 
show an association between nutrition 
label and improved diet. However, we 
note that these studies did not account 
for the potential self-selection problem 
and may overstate the effectiveness of 
nutrition labeling in improving diet. In 
addition, none of these studies directly 
assessed the consumer responses to 
labeling on raw meat products. 
Neuhouser, et al. 1999, analyzed data 
from a survey of 1,450 adult residents in 
Washington State. The survey assessed 
nutrition label use, fat-related diet 
habits, fruit and vegetable consumption, 
diet-related psychological factors, health 
behavior and demographic 
characteristics. They concluded that 
nutrition label use was significantly 
associated with lower fat intake and, 
after controlling for all demographic, 
psychosocial, and behavioral variables, 
nutrition label use explained 6 percent 
of the variance in fat intake, with a 
probability of 99.9 percent. 
Teisl and Levy in 1997 conducted a 
3-year study on the direct effects of 
nutrition shelf label information on 
consumer purchasing behavior. Shelf 
labels containing nutrition information 
were found to have small but significant 
effects on consumer dietary patterns. 
The study also found that providing 
nutrition information may allow 
consumers to more easily switch 
consumption away from ‘‘unhealthy’’ 
products in food categories where 
differences in other quality 
characteristics, such as taste, are 
relatively small toward consumption of 
products in food categories where the 
difference in taste between the more and 
less fatty products may be relatively 
large. The type and format for the 
nutrition information used in the study, 
brand specific nutrition information 
provided on the shelf in conjunction 
with the products’ unit and item price 
information, may help to explain the 
results. This research shows that the 
main effect of the nutrition shelf 
labeling program occurred relatively 
quickly. The authors attribute this 
response, in part, to ancillary activities 
efforts, such as measures to enhance 
consumer health education, occurring as 
part of the initial nutrition labeling 
program being evaluated. 
Related research conducted by Teisl, 
Bockstael, and Levy in 2001 found that 
the provision of nutrition information 
led consumers to change purchase 
behavior, but may not necessarily lead 
to their buying more ‘‘healthy’’ foods. 
They conclude that consumer responses 
to nutrition labeling may take two 
forms: a ‘‘health’’ effect and a 
‘‘substitution’’ effect. The first arises 
when consumers reduce net intake of 
‘‘unhealthy’’ nutrients and increase 
purchases of ‘‘healthy’’ foods. The 
second effect occurs when consumers 
increase their level of satisfaction by 
substitution across food categories using 
nutrition information to maintain an 
overall level of health risk while 
increasing satisfaction from other food 
attributes, such as flavor. They also note 
that economic analyses that identify the 
benefits of health risk reduction as the 
costs of foregone illness may understate 
the overall benefits of nutrition labeling. 
They assert that consumer welfare is 
improved (and, therefore, there is a 
willingness to pay for nutrition 
information) even if health risks are not 
reduced because consumers make food 
choices more in line with non-health 
preferences about food attributes. 
Research by Moorman in 1996 
examined whether the NLEA increased 
consumers’ understanding of nutrition 
information at the point of sale, whether 
understanding of nutrition information 
has been promoted regardless of 
individual consumer preferences, and 
whether understanding of nutrition 
information at the point of sale has 
increased for healthful and non- 
healthful products. Moorman found 
statistically significant increases in 
consumers’ nutrition information 
acquisition after the NLEA took effect. 
Motivated consumers acquired more 
information after the law went into 
effect than before and even the less 
motivated more accurately recalled fat 
content after the law went into effect. 
The research also found that consumers 
retained more information about higher 
fat products (defined as those having 
more than 5.5 grams of fat per serving) 
than they did about lower fat products. 
The author made the assessment that 
standardized and adequate nutrition 
information, as required by the NLEA, 
raised awareness of the nutritional 
quality of food products, thereby 
increasing the focus on higher fat 
products. Consequently, the NLEA may 
have spurred product competition, even 
among high fat products (Aldrich). 
Ippolito and Mathios (1995) studied 
the effect of an FDA relaxation on a 
prohibition against health claims. 
Following the decision to allow health 
claims on labels in 1985, nutrition 
advertising, a form of nutrition 
education when such advertising 
contains factual information, increased 
significantly. While they found that fat 
consumption per capita fell prior to the 
FDA decision to allow health claims on 
labels, it fell at a faster rate after the 
prohibition was eased. Their research 
also found that prior to when health 
claims were allowed, fat consumption 
declined among categories of food 
whose fat or cholesterol content was 
widely communicated: Meat, eggs, and 
fats and oils. However, increases in fat 
content from other foods largely offset 
these consumption declines. After 
relaxing the prohibition, people 
consumed less fat across more 
categories, with less of an increase in 
consumption in other categories. The 
results suggest that more specific 
information about nutritional content of 
foods assists consumers in making 
healthier food choices within food 
categories. 
In related research, Mathios and 
Ippolito (1998) analyzed the effect of 
nutrition information in advertising and 
labels on consumption of food cereals 
with fiber content. They divided their 
study into two periods: The period 
1974–1984, when the FDA permitted 
printing of fiber content on cereal boxes 
but did not permit printing of any 
health claims; and the period 1985– 
1987, when health claims were 
permitted. They concluded that, in 
concert with an increase in fiber intake 
of cereals in their diets, the average

intakes of fat, saturated fat, and dietary 
cholesterol for both men and women 
declined during both the periods, albeit 
the decline was greater during the 
second period relative to the first. They 
concluded that the increase in fiber and 
the decrease in fat and cholesterol 
consumption were associated with the 
consumption of labeled cereals. 
Although the self-selection issue 
noted above complicates the precise 
measurement of the incremental impact 
of labeling, the results of the studies 
identified above suggest there may be a 
positive link between nutrition label use 
and dietary change beyond that 
resulting from healthier eating habits of 
those who regularly rely on nutrition 
labels. 
Consumer Response to Nutrition 
Labeling 
FSIS consulted with ERS to develop 
the empirical analysis of the benefits of 
nutrition labeling for the proposed rule 
(Crutchfield, et al., 2001b). The 
estimated benefits take the form of 
reductions in the incidence of coronary 
heart disease and three types of cancer 
that may accrue as consumers improve 
their diet quality through increased use 
of nutrition information generated by 
the regulation. 
As will be shown, survey data on 
nutrient intake and label use were used 
to correlate intake of fat, saturated fat, 
and cholesterol with usage of existing 
nutrition information. The Agency 
estimated the value of the potential 
changes from intake of fat, saturated fat, 
and cholesterol that could occur as 
consumers respond to the newly 
available nutrition information. A 
model developed by Zarkin et al. (1991, 
1993) links changes in the serum 
cholesterol rate to changes in the 
percentage of total calories from 
polyunsaturated fat, saturated fat, and 
dietary cholesterol. Changes in serum 
cholesterol are then used to estimate the 
health outcomes, which are reductions 
in the number of cases and mortality 
from three cancers (breast, colorectal, 
and prostate) and coronary heart 
disease. Finally, the economic value to 
the public health changes were 
estimated by assuming an implied value 
of life associated with reductions in 
premature mortality. 
Assumptions were made concerning 
consumer behavior to determine how 
much of a behavioral response and 
change in dietary intake may result from 
providing more nutrition information on 
meat and poultry products. For 
example, when nutrition labels and 
other sources of nutrition information 
are provided for raw meat and poultry 
products, FSIS made the assumption 
that nutrition information usage rates 
will rise to match nutrition label usage 
rates for food products as a whole (Table 
15).

Using the proportions of men (2.2 
percent) and women (2.0 percent) who 
report not buying raw meat, poultry or 
fish, the new assumed label use 
distribution after mandatory labeling is 
shown in Table 15b. The percentage of 
men who would use the label often to 
buy raw meat, poultry, or fish would be 
26.1, which is obtained as 0.267*97.8, 
where .267 is the proportion of men 
who use label often in Table 15 and 97.8 
is the percentage of men who buy raw 
meat, poultry, or fish. 
Currently, some nutrition information 
is provided for some single-ingredient, 
raw meat and poultry products, but the 
information is not currently required. 
Mandatory nutrition labeling rules for 
the major cuts and ground or chopped 
products would mean that the nutrition 
information provided for these products 
would be comparable to that provided 
for other food products. The analysis 
could reasonably assume that nutrition 
information usage rates for raw meat 
and poultry products would then 
become the same as the nutrition label 
usage rates for all foods taken together. 
For example, before mandatory 
nutrition information labeling, the data 
show that about 17 percent of men look 
for nutrition information on meat 
‘‘Often’’ (Row 2 of Table 15). In this 
analysis, then, it is assumed that after 
mandatory nutrition information 
labeling, 26.7 percent of men would use 
the nutrition fact panel or POP materials 
for meat products, which is the 
nutrition label usage rate for all foods 
(Row 1 of Table 15). Similarly, the 
Agency assumed that the percentage of 
women using nutrition information on 
meat products ‘‘Sometimes’’ would rise 
from 18 percent to 32.6 percent. 
To assess the impacts on diet quality, 
the Agency assumed in the preliminary 
regulatory impact analysis that as 
nutrition information usage rates rise for 
consumers eating meat and poultry, 
dietary patterns will change in a manner 
consistent with current data. However, 
Crutchfield et al. (2001b) note that this 
is an ‘‘admittedly strong’’ assumption. 
As shown above, there is strong 
statistical evidence that people who use 
nutrition information to guide their food 
consumption decisions have healthier 
diets. While other factors may be at 
work, the Agency made the assumption 
that the provision of additional 
nutrition information and making that 
information available to more 
consumers will lead to behavioral shifts 
and improved diet quality. Thus, the 
assumption is made that the effect of 
providing new nutrition information for 
meat and poultry products would make 
some (not all) consumers who currently 
do not look for nutrition information on

meat and poultry products more aware 
of the dietary implications of their food 
choices. As these consumers see the 
new nutrition labels on packages of 
meat and poultry products or new POP 
information, they may begin to use the 
nutrition label or POP information or to 
use it more frequently. Some of these 
consumers would then choose to 
consume the same mix of products as 
people who are currently aware of the 
nutritional quality of meat and poultry 
products because they look for such 
nutrition information as currently is 
available. For example, men who 
currently do not look for nutrition 
information on meat in the absence of 
mandatory nutrition information 
labeling who would begin using this 
information ‘‘Sometimes’’ after nutrition 
labeling is in place would see a decrease 
in fat intake from 96 grams to 92.5 
grams (Row 1 of Table 16). Women who 
previously had been using labels 
‘‘Sometimes’’ who now use them 
‘‘Often’’ would see a decrease in 
saturated fat intake from 20.60 grams to 
17.39 grams (Row 5 of Table 16). Similar 
changes in fat and saturated intakes as 
a percentage of total calories can be 
assessed from Table 17. 
The Crutchfield et al. (2001b) study 
simply assumed consistency of behavior 
toward label use and changes in diet 
quality. Whether the assumption leads 
to overstating or understating health 
benefits is not known. 
Consumers will not use labels to make 
very significant dietary changes. If diet 
quality associations found with all other 
labeled foods do not hold up for 
nutrition labels on meat, then health 
benefits in the supplemental PRIA are 
overestimated. Of course, health 
benefits are only one way in which 
benefits might be realized. Consumers 
might choose to use nutritional 
information to enhance enjoyment of 
food, and not to raise their health status. 
Further, they may be better off than if 
they had raised their health status, since 
rational consumers will use information 
to their best advantage. If we observe 
rational, well-informed consumers 
selecting a more enjoyable diet, for these 
consumers a more enjoyable diet was 
worth more than better health. Thus, 
when we restrict benefits estimates to 
allow only for information to be used to 
advance health status, we are 
simultaneously restricting estimated 
benefits to a lower level of value to 
consumers. The FSIS analysis imposes 
that restriction and the resulting 
benefits estimate must therefore be 
interpreted as an underestimate of 
overall benefits.

Economic Research Service of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture analyzed 
how requirements for mandatory 
nutrition information labeling of raw 
meat and poultry products could 
possibly affect diet quality (Crutchfield, 
et al., 2001b). Table 18 shows the 
estimated intake of fat, saturated fat, and

for the assumed change in patterns of 
label use. To reach the values shown in 
Table 18, each cell in Table 16 (the 
dietary intake of fat, saturated fat, and 
cholesterol) was multiplied by the 
associated percentage of label use 
(nutrition facts panel use) from Table 
15. This increased the number of people 
in the ‘‘often’’ and ‘‘sometimes’’ cells, 
and decreased the number of people in 
the ‘‘rarely/never’’ cells, so that the 
distribution of label usage on meat and 
poultry products would reflect the 
distribution of label usage on all 
products.

35 The calculations in Tables 18 and 19 ignore the 
fact that 2.2% of men and 2% of women report not 
buying meat, poultry or fish (Table 15). If these 
proportions are assumed to remain unchanged after 
mandatory labeling, then the decrease in intakes 
estimated in Tables 18 and 19 would be slightly 
different.

Note: Fat intake in grams, cholesterol in milligrams. Fat and saturated fat intake changes are in percentage terms, cholesterol intake changes 
are absolute changes in milligrams. (Crutchfield, et al., 2001b.) 
Applying these new label use 
percentages of men and women to their 
intakes in Tables 18 and 19, the new 
estimated changes in intakes, after 
accounting for non-buyers, are reported 
in Tables 18b and 19b.

Note that the second column in Table 
18b is computed as the weighted 
average of intakes from Table 16, using 
the percentages in Table 15 as weights. 
For example, for the total fat intake of 
men, 81.64 *.261 + 92.49 *.25 + 96.09 
*.467 + 74.48 *.022 = 90.94. 
Aggregating across categories, a new 
weighted average intake is obtained, 
which could be seen after the 
imposition of mandatory labeling 
requirements. Table 19 shows the 
percentage of calories from fat and 
cholesterol intake that were derived in 
a similar manner using intakes from 
Table 17.35

Note in Table 19 that fat intake is in

Further, fat and saturated fat intake 
changes are in percentage terms, and 
cholesterol intake changes are absolute 
changes in milligrams. (Crutchfield, et 
al., 2001b).

Note: Fat and saturated fat intake changes are in percentage terms, cholesterol intake changes are absolute changes in milligrams. 
Applying these new label use 
percentages of men and women to their 
intakes in Tables 18 and 19, the new 
estimated change in intakes, after 
accounting for non-buyers, are reported 
in Tables 18b and 19b. 
Comparing Table 18b with Table 18 
and Table 19b with Table 19, it can be 
seen that when the proportions of non- 
buyers are assumed to remain 
unchanged, the estimated decrease in 
intakes of fat and saturated fat are 
higher, decrease in cholesterol is nearly 
the same for men, whereas for women 
cholesterol intake increases slightly. 
This is because the fat and saturated fat 
intakes of buyers are higher than non- 
buyers, whereas the cholesterol intakes 
of women buyers are in general lower 
than women non-buyers. Based on these 
magnitudes, if the new numbers are 
used in the calculations, the benefits of 
labeling are likely to be even higher. 
Evaluation of Health Effects 
Based on epidemiological research, 
the estimated reductions in calories 
from fat and cholesterol intake (Table 
19) were used to estimate the decrease 
in the incidence of major diseases 
associated with consumption of fat and 
cholesterol. The diseases considered in 
this analysis include three types of 
cancer and coronary heart disease. 
Epidemiological studies of the 
relationships between dietary fat and 
cholesterol intake and incidence of 
cancer and coronary heart disease 
indicate that saturated and 
polyunsaturated fat and cholesterol are 
converted into serum cholesterol. Serum 
cholesterol has an impact on the 
incidence rates of these diseases. 
Zarkin, et al. (1993) developed a model 
which estimated the relationships 
between dietary intake of fat and 
cholesterol to convert fat contents into 
the change in fat and serum cholesterol: 
(1) SC (Mg/) = 2.16S¥1.65P + 0.097C 
Where SC is serum cholesterol, S is the 
change in percentage of total calories 
represented by saturated fat, P is the 
change in percentage of total calories 
represented by polyunsaturated fat, and 
C is the change in dietary cholesterol 
measured in mg/1,000 calories. 
Mancino and Kuchler (2009) show 
that the threat of severe adverse health 
consequences can induce significant 
improvements in diet quality 
(improvements from the perspective of 
the public health community, not from 
consumers’ perspectives). Cigarette 
smoking and dietary intake of 
cholesterol, total fat, and saturated fat 
are lower for those whose physicians 
told them they have high cholesterol, 
compared to those with undiagnosed 
high cholesterol. But, some also choose 
to compromise diet quality. Mancino 
and Kuchler found that dietary intake of 
cholesterol is unaffected by the decision 
to take cholesterol-lowering medication. 
However, for those taking cholesterol- 
lowering medication, diets are higher in 
total fats and in saturated fats than are 
diets of those with unmedicated high 
cholesterol. The waist circumference of 
those on medication is also larger, 
although some of the increase may be 
associated with reduced cigarette 
consumption. The increased dietary 
intake of fat and saturated fat, along 
with increased waist size are telling 
evidence of offsetting behavior, as 
medication lowers the health price of 
unhealthy choices. 
Reductions in serum cholesterol are 
then converted to reduction in risk of 
coronary heart disease and the three 
types of cancers. The estimated values 
of percentage changes in saturated fat 
and cholesterol intake from the last 
column of Table 18 were substituted 
into the model developed by Zarkin, et 
al. Since separate data for 
polyunsaturated (P) fat were not 
available, it was assumed that P would 
be one-third of total fats, as was also 
assumed by Zarkin, et al. The estimates 
of serum cholesterol for male and 
female consumers and reductions in 
mortality are shown in Table 20.

The calculated values of SC presented 
above were used to estimate incidence 
of breast, prostate, colon/rectal cancer, 
and coronary heart disease. Zarkin, et 
al. (1993) concluded that an increase in 
serum cholesterol by 20 mg/1,000 
calories was associated with a 1.2- 
percent increase in the incidence of 
each of these diseases. This rate was 
used to convert reductions in total fat, 
saturated fat, and cholesterol in Table 
18 into SC. It is estimated that the

36 These estimates are based upon the rates that 
were calculated for the PRIA. 
reduction in mortality associated with 
changing dietary pattern resulting from 
mandatory nutrition information 
labeling are 0.024 percent for men, and 
about 0.014 percent for women. 
However, Crutchfield et al. (2001b) note 
that: ‘‘the link between fat intake, serum 
cholesterol, and cancer risk is less clear 
than for coronary heart disease.’’ 
The PRIA did not estimate changes in 
total meat or poultry consumption that 
may result from the rule, because of the 
assumption that consumers would 
choose different types of meat and 
poultry to reduce fat, saturated fat, and 
cholesterol. For example, consumers 
may consume more poultry and less red 
meat, or they may consume more white 
poultry meat and less dark poultry meat 
in response to the newly available 
nutrition information. Also, in response 
to the nutrition information, consumers 
may prefer to purchase meat that has 
been trimmed more closely to remove 
fat. 
The assumption that total 
consumption of meat or poultry would 
not change in response to the newly 
available nutrition information is 
consistent with the approach taken by 
other studies that examine consumers’ 
response to health claims. One such 
study is noted in the PRIA (66 FR 4989, 
January 18, 2001). There is no research 
available that establishes a relationship 
among nutrition labeling information, 
health effects, and total meat or poultry 
consumption. 
Table 21 presents data on the annual 
number of deaths associated with the 
three types of cancer and coronary heart 
disease for men and women in the 
United States in 1998. Data for the 
number of deaths came from the 
National Center for Health Statistics 
(coronary heart disease) and the 
American Cancer Society (cancer). Data 
on colorectal cancer were not available 
by gender; FSIS assumed the estimated 
56,000 cases were distributed equally 
between men and women.

Coronary Heart Disease .................................................................... 0.0240 0.0139 231,332 228,769 55 32 87 
The fact that FSIS’s analysis did not 
estimate changes in total meat or 
poultry consumption may be a 
limitation of the results, but it is not a 
major concern, because FSIS’s analysis 
assumes that when consumers read the 
new nutrition information, they will use 
the information and choose to consume 
the same mix of products as consumers 
that are aware of the nutritional quality 
of meat and poultry. The calculations in 
the PRIA are based on a distribution of 
nutrition label usage on meat and 
poultry that reflects the distribution of 
nutrition label usage for food products 
as a whole. FSIS did not receive 
comments on the fact that the PRIA did 
not estimate changes in total meat or 
poultry consumption. The supplemental 
PRIA incorporates the PRIA’s estimates 
of potential changes from intake of fat, 
saturated fat, and cholesterol that could 
occur as consumers respond to the 
newly available nutrition information. 
Finally, the Agency attached an 
economic value to the public health 
changes by estimating the implied value 
of life associated with reductions in 
premature mortality. 
Using recent estimates, deaths from 
breast cancer are estimated at 39,800, 
prostate cancer at 29,800 and colorectal 
cancer at 57,100 in 2003. Deaths from 
coronary heart disease are estimated at 
515,204 for 2000. As a result, the 
estimated lives saved due to dietary 
changes from nutrition labeling are 
revised from those shown in Table 21. 
The revised estimates are as follows: 
annual deaths from breast cancer are 
reduced by an estimated 5.5, deaths 
from prostate cancer by 7.2, deaths from 
colorectal cancer by 10.8, and deaths 
from coronary heart disease by 97.8.36 
The total annual lives saved due to 
dietary changes from nutrition labeling 
for all diseases is 121.7. 
Effect of Nutrition Labeling on 
Consumer Attitudes About Beef 
As reported by the National 
Cattlemen’s Beef Association (2009) the 
U.S. meat industry trade organizations, 
namely the National Cattlemen’s Beef 
Association (NCBA), the Food 
Marketing Institute (FMI) and the 
National Pork Board (NPB), conducted 
research to examine the benefits and 
challenges of implementing on-pack 
nutrition labeling for meat products. 
This research included qualitative and 
quanitative studies (via focus groups) to 
explore consumer needs, behavior and 
preference for nutrition labeling on 
fresh meat products. 
Focus Group Key Learnings 
Findings from the focus groups 
indicated that consumers desire more 
nutrition information, find both on-pack 
and POP materials useful but prefer on- 
pack, and still want to see the product 
they are purchasing. Additional 
learnings indicate: 
—Consumers want to see nutrition 
information for fresh meat and they 
want more information on specific 
nutritional content. 
• Information on fat content, calories 
per serving, cholesterol and proteins are 
of greatest importance. 
• Micronutrients (vitamins and 
minerals) are also of interest. 
—Consumers are generally unaware of 
the micronutrients found in fresh meat 
products and they want to see all of the 
nutrient information a food provides 
(but aren’t interested in what a food 
doesn’t have such as 0 percent for 
Vitamin C). 
—Consumers currently use on-pack 
labels most often to learn about the 
nutritional content of meat products 
because there is higher awareness for 
labels than for posters or take-home 
brochures. 
Beef Checkoff-Funded Research 
Given the beef industry’s philosophy 
that nutrition information should be 
widely available to help people make 
informed purchase decisions, yet 
understanding the challenges many 
retailers face in providing the 
information in a simple and easy-to- 
understand format, NCBA embarked on 
a number of additional nutrition 
labeling research projects. The goal of

37 This amount includes nonmajor cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry that are not 
ground or chopped. The data available do not 
distinguish between major and nonmajor cuts. 
38 Source: Per capita consumption estimates are 
found at U.S. Department of Agriculture, World 
Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates and 
Supporting Materials. Published in Livestock, 
Dairy, and Poultry Outlook, http// 
www.ers.usda.gov/publications/ldp/. Total 
consumption is based on a total U.S. population of 
288.4 million. 
39 For an in-depth analysis of this issue, see Fred 
Kuchler and Elise Golan, 1999. 
this subsequent research was to further 
understand appropriate methods and 
vehicles for retailers to share the 
information with consumers. 
Effect of Exemptions on Benefits 
Estimates 
Under this rule should it become 
final, all very small establishments 
would be exempt from the requirement 
for nutrition labeling of ground or 
chopped products because they have 
500 or fewer employees, are owned by 
companies with 500 or fewer 
employees, and likely produce 100,000 
pounds or less annually of each ground 
product. Finally, retail firms that have 
500 or fewer employees would be 
exempt from nutrition labeling 
requirements for ground or chopped 
products, provided they produce 
100,000 or less annually of each ground 
product. This exemption for small 
businesses will reduce the benefits 
associated with the rule in proportion to 
the share of ground or chopped 
products affected by the rule that are 
sold at these establishments. 
FSIS estimates that the number of 
packages of ground or chopped product 
sold or produced through exempt 
facilities is approximately 469 million 
packages (2.267 billion packages times 
20.7 percent, the estimated share of 
packages sold at ‘‘exempt’’ 
establishments as shown using U.S. 
Census 2002 data in the Cost Analysis). 
At an average of 2.735 pounds per 
package, the average amount of ground 
or chopped product sold at these 
establishments is about 1.283 billion 
pounds (469 million packages × 2.735 
pounds per package). FSIS estimates 
that of the total of 6.201 billion pounds 
of ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products consumed annually, 4.918 
billion pounds will be affected by the 
labeling requirements of the rule. 
As discussed above, the rule would 
provide numerous exemptions from 
nutrition labeling requirements, in 
addition to the small business 
exemptions, for ground or chopped 
products sold through retail facilities. 
FSIS reduced costs and benefits to 
account for the small business 
exemption regarding the labeling of 
ground or chopped products. However, 
FSIS did not reduce the costs or benefits 
estimates to account for the other 
exemptions for ground or chopped 
product because the volume of ground 
or chopped product that would qualify 
for these other exemptions is very low. 
Should it become final, the 
supplemental proposed rule would not 
provide a small business exemption 
from the nutrition labeling requirements 
for the major cuts. The rule provides 
numerous other exemptions from 
nutrition labeling requirements for the 
major cuts. However, FSIS did not 
reduce the costs or benefits estimates to 
account for the exemptions for major 
cuts because the volume of major cuts 
that would qualify for these exemptions 
is very low. 
FSIS estimates that the total amount 
of major and nonmajor cuts of single- 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products is 19.6 billion pounds.37 Of 
this amount, FSIS estimates that 16.745 
billion pounds, or 85 percent are major 
cuts, would be subject to the label 
requirements of the rule as indicated 
above. The estimate of the total amount 
of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products that are not ground or 
chopped is based on recent research 
conducted by the Economic Research 
Service on beef and pork consumption 
and on information provided by the 
National Chicken Council and National 
Turkey Federation at their Web sites. 
The derivation of this estimate is shown 
in Appendix A, Tables 1–4. 
Based on these estimates, 16.745 
billion pounds of major cuts are affected 
by the supplemental proposed rule. 
From above, 4.918 billion pounds of 
ground or chopped product are affected 
by the rule, for a total of or 21.663 
billion pounds of meat and poultry 
products. This compares to a total of 63 
billion pounds of red meat and poultry 
products consumed in the United States 
in 2003.38 The exemption for small 
businesses affects 1.283 billion pounds 
of ground or chopped product, or 5.92 
percent of the total amount of meat and 
poultry products affected by the rule. 
Consequently, the total annual lives 
saved due to dietary changes from 
nutrition labeling for all diseases is 
reduced accordingly. For example, the 
maximum number of lives saved 
annually declines from 121.7 to 114.5 
(121.7 × (1.0–0.0592)). 
Estimating the Benefits of Preventing 
Premature Death 
The benefits of this supplemental 
proposed rule would be the lives saved 
due to the estimated reductions in 
mortality rates associated with coronary 
heart disease and selected cancers. The 
Agency believes that there are potential 
benefits associated with the reductions 
in non-fatal cases of coronary heart 
disease. However, identifying and 
quantifying the risk reduction of 
premature death in an economic context 
is difficult. Similarly, it is also complex 
applying risk reductions of non-fatal 
cases of diseases within an economic 
context.39 Given questions concerning 
data quality and unsettled 
methodological issues in estimating the 
benefits of a reduction in non-fatal cases 
of coronary heart disease, FSIS is 
restricting its analysis of benefits to 
reductions in premature death. 
If food were marketed by risk levels 
(e.g., probabilities of inducing cancer or 
heart disease), and consumers treated 
advertised risk levels as they do other 
objectively measurable product 
characteristics (e.g., weight or volume), 
there would be little difficulty in 
valuing diet-related food safety risk 
factors. Product prices could be 
statistically associated with risk levels, 
yielding the risk-dollar trade-off 
consumers make. That is, one could 
measure, based on consumer purchases, 
the dollar value consumers attach to 
particular types of risk reduction. 
However, there is no ‘‘market’’ for 
reducing diet-related fatal risks and 
these values can not be measured. 
There is no price that can be tabulated 
from commercial transactions that 
reflects the value of reducing diet- 
related fatal risks. Actions that 
individuals might take to reduce these 
risks do not leave a behavioral trail for 
analysts to follow. This informational 
void makes it difficult to evaluate 
programs that might reduce diet-related 
risks. In particular, there is no obvious 
dollar value to assign to the major 
benefit of such programs, namely lives 
saved and reductions in cases of non- 
fatal diseases. 
Ultimately, FSIS wanted to monetize 
the benefits of diet-related fatal health 
risk reduction. The Agency’s goal was to 
find a method of transferring market- 
based risk-dollar trade-off estimates to 
diet-related fatal cancer risks. 
The most studied risk choices are 
those for on-the-job risks of accidental 
injury and death. Analysts have 
estimated the compensation required to 
induce workers to accept such risks. 
Many studies of labor market behavior 
have been carried out because the wide 
range of risk levels workers accept and 
the wide range of wages paid are 
amenable to statistical analysis. 
Available evidence suggests that 
workers’ subjective assessments of risks 
they face are plausible (Viscusi, 1992).

40 FSIS revised the method employed in the 
preliminary regulatory impact analysis of the rule 
to estimate human health benefits based on 
guidance to all Federal agencies concerning the 
estimation of human health benefits. The revised 
method uses a single value for each premature 
death prevented, regardless of age. The revised 
method results in significantly higher human health 
benefits resulting from the nutrition labeling 
requirements of the rule. 
FSIS is using a range for the value of 
life of $5.0 million to $6.5 million with 
a mean of $5.5 million. The preliminary 
regulatory impact analysis of the rule 
used a single value of $5.0 million. The 
value of a statistical life is not the value 
an individual would pay to save his 
own life, but the aggregate value paid by 
many individuals to reduce a small risk 
of death each faces. To make this 
transfer, FSIS assumed that individuals 
make consistent risk choices, reducing 
health risks as much as their budgets 
allow. The Agency assumed individuals 
focus on the likelihood of health 
outcomes and the gravity of these 
outcomes.40 
Viscusi (1992) has summarized the 
empirical work estimating the value of 
risk of premature death. Several studies 
had estimated the risk-dollar trade-off in 
the labor market by dividing the wage 
premium for high-risk jobs by the risk 
of a fatal job injury. Drawing on the 
compiled results of these studies, he 
stated: ‘‘Although the estimates of the 
risk-dollar trade-off vary considerably 
depending on the population exposed to 
the risk, the nature of the risk, and 
similar factors, most of the reasonable 
estimates of the value of life are 
clustered in the $3 to $7 million range’’ 
(Ibid., p. 73). Thus, compensating wages 
indicate that, on average, industrial 
workers value a statistical life at $5 
million (December 1990 dollars), the 
midpoint of the range. The Economic 
Research Service, USDA has used a 
value of $5 million per life estimate 
(adjusted upwards for inflation to 2000 
dollars) to measure the benefits of 
preventing premature death from 
foodborne diseases caused by microbial 
pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7, 
Salmonella spp., and Listeria 
monocytogenes (Crutchfield, et al., 
2001a). This estimate has been used by 
other government agencies to evaluate 
the benefits of regulations designed to 
reduce the risk of premature death. For 
example, the Food and Drug 
Administration (66 FR 6137, January 19, 
2001) and the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (Miller, 1997) currently use 
Viscusi’s mid-point value of $5 million 
for each life saved (Kuchler and Golan, 
1999, p.25). Finally, the Food and Drug 
Administration (68 FR 41434, July 11, 
2003, and 69 FR 56824, September 22, 
2004) use both $5.0 million and $6.5 
million as the value of a statistical life. 
FSIS believes that the value for a 
statistical life used in the analysis is 
consistent with current practices, OMB 
guidance, and research. 
It should be noted that the 
calculations used to estimate present 
value explicitly account for the time 
factor associated with delayed health 
impacts of dietary change. Decreases in 
intake of saturated fat, fat, and 
cholesterol will reduce the incidence of 
heart disease and cancer, but not 
immediately—the reductions in illness 
and death will begin to occur years into 
the future. To address the uncertainty 
associated with the reduced incidence 
of heart disease and cancer, FSIS 
identified three plausible scenarios that 
are intended to encompass the actual 
impact. The scenarios are shown in 
Table 22. The first scenario assumes that 
there would not be any reduction in 
mortality in the first time period 
covering the first two years after the 
effective date of the rule. During the 
second time period covering the third 
through the seventh years following the 
effective date, 25 percent of the 
potential reduction in human health 
risk is achieved—28.6 lives saved 
annually as a result of dietary changes. 
In period 4, covering the last eight years 
of the period of analysis, the full 
reduction in human health risk is 
achieved—114.5 lives saved annually as 
a result of dietary changes. In scenarios 
2 and 3, the benefits of the rule are 
assumed to occur progressively later in 
the period of analysis.

To arrive at an estimate of the benefits 
associated with reductions in mortality 
due to changes in fat and cholesterol 
intake, FSIS multiplied the dollar values 
assigned to each premature death ($5.0, 
$5.5, and $6.5 million) prevented by the 
number of lives saved annually in the 
three scenarios due to changes in diet 
quality. The present values of the 
benefits associated with the reductions 
in mortality associated with the 
scenarios identified in Table 22 are 
shown in Table 23. The net present 
value of the human health benefits of 
reduced mortality for all diseases over 
20 years is estimated to be a maximum 
of $5.9 billion under Scenario 1 using a 
discount rate of 3 percent and $6.5 
million for each premature death 
avoided. The lowest present value of 
human health benefits occurs under 
Scenario 3 using a discount rate of 7 
percent and $5.0 million for each 
premature death avoided and is

41 The estimates amounts of major cuts and 
ground or chopped products are shown in Table 24. 
estimated to be $1.1 billion. These 
benefits would be distributed among the 
diseases evaluated in the same share 
that they represent of total lives saved 
due to dietary changes from nutrition 
labeling as shown above. 
Based on the information shown in 
Table 22, FSIS constructed a composite 
scenario for all diseases by first 
computing the average number of lives 
saved annually from the three scenarios. 
The derivation of lives saved for the 
composite scenario is shown in 
Appendix A, Table 5. The annual 
average for lives saved over the 20 year 
period under the composite scenario 
was 50.1. This compares with annual 
averages of 67.3, 50.1, and 32.9 lives 
saved under scenarios 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively (Appendix A, Table 5). To 
estimate an average human health 
benefit over the three scenarios, the 
annual average number of lives saved 
under the composite scenario is 
multiplied by each of the three values 
for a statistical life year. The average is 
then computed for each year to derive 
the annual values of lives saved under 
the composite scenario as is shown in 
Appendix A, Table 6. Each value was 
weighted equally. The results of the 
analysis of the composite scenario show 
a net present value for lives saved of 
$3.694 billion using a 3 percent 
discount rate, and $2.177 billion using 
a 7 percent discount rate. The 
corresponding annualized human health 
benefits from the reduction in all 
diseases are $248.3 and $205.5 million, 
respectively. The benefits estimates 
presented here assume POP nutrition 
information to be equally successful as 
nutrition labels in leading to dietary 
change and consequent reductions in 
the three cancers studied and coronary 
heart disease. However, this assumption 
is not realistic. The analysis of 
alternatives section below provides a 
range of benefits estimates using 
different assumptions about the relative 
effectiveness of the POP nutrition. 
These annualized values will be used in 
the cost-effectiveness analysis.

Effects of Current Compliance Levels 
As has been discussed in the Cost 
Analysis, the level of participation in 
the voluntary nutrition labeling program 
is 54.8 percent of stores for major cuts 
(USDA, 1999). In addition, an estimated 
68 percent of ground or chopped 
products bear nutrition labels (NCBA, 
2004). The analysis of benefits 
presented above assumes no prior 
compliance. Were these levels of 
compliance incorporated into the 
amount of meat and poultry product 
affected by the supplemental proposed 
rule, the amount of product affected 
would decline from 21.6 billion pounds 
to 9.1 billion pounds 41 (21.6 billion 
pounds minus 16.7 billion pounds of 
major cuts × (1.0–0.548) and 4.9 billion 
pounds ground or chopped product × 
(1.0–0.68). Since the benefits analysis 
treats the consumption of types of meat 
and poultry products the same in terms 
of their impacts on human health, the 
benefits would be reduced accordingly. 
Instead of achieving a maximum 
number of lives saved of 114.5 annually, 
which is the starting value for the 
benefits analysis, the rule would save at 
most 42.1 lives annually. Under the 
composite scenario, modified 
accordingly, the annual number of lives 
saved would be 18.4. The present values 
of the benefits are $1.358 and $.800 
billion using 3 and 7 percent discount 
rates, respectively. The corresponding 
annual benefits are $91.3 million and 
$75.5 million. The estimated benefits 
under this scenario can be compared 
with those in Table 23 above. 
3. Minimum Effectiveness of Measures 
Required by the Supplemental Proposed 
Rule for Benefits To Exceed Costs 
In the cost analysis of the proposed 
and supplemental proposed rules, FSIS 
assumes that retailers will display POP 
nutrition information for the major cuts 
rather than apply nutrition labels to 
these products because this is a lower- 
cost means of providing nutrition 
information for multiple products. The 
benefits analysis does not provide 
separate estimates of the benefits of 
nutrition labels and POP information as 
it was not possible to distinguish 
between the behavioral response and 
change in dietary intake associated with 
these two means of conveying nutrition 
information to the consumer. 
The Agency assumes that when labels 
and other sources of nutrition 
information are provided for raw meat

42 Annualized benefits are defined as the average 
annual amounts, when discounted, will provide a 
present value benefits equal to that shown for the 
selected scenario. It is a means for providing a 
single annual amount for a scenario showing 
significant differences on a year-to-year basis. 
and poultry products that nutrition 
information usage rates will rise to 
match label usage rates for food 
products as a whole, and that dietary 
patterns will change in a manner 
consistent with current data. Labeling, 
as used in the surveys matching its 
usage and dietary changes, has generally 
been interpreted to mean on-package 
labels rather than POP labeling. 
Consequently, the discussion of the 
benefits of the rule has implicitly 
focused on on-package labels. 
In the analysis below, we first 
estimate the reduction in risk associated 
with POP nutrition information 
sufficient to equate its benefits and 
costs. Then we estimate remaining 
benefits of the rule that must be 
attributed to on-package nutrition labels 
for benefits to exceed costs. 
The estimated cost of providing POP 
nutrition information is $5.67 million 
starting the year of the effective date and 
every other year thereafter. The net 
present values using a discount rate of 
3 and 7 percent for the 20-year period 
of analysis are discounted costs of 
$42.82 and $31.07 million, respectively. 
The annualized values for these net 
present values are $2.88 and $2.93 
million, respectively (Table 25). The net 
present values for the 20-year costs of 
on-package nutrition labels for ground 
and chopped products are $429.41 
million and $316.99 million, using 3 
and 7 percent discount rates, 
respectively. The annualized cost 
associated with net present values using 
3 and 7 percent discount rates are 
$28.86 and $29.92 million, 
respectively.42 Under the composite 
scenario discussed in the benefits 
analysis, there is an average of 50.1 lives 
saved annually as a result of the 
nutrition labeling requirements of the 
rule. 
The average reduction in risk for the 
benefits of POP nutrition information 
for major cuts of single ingredient, raw 
products to equal their cost is 0.53 lives 
saved annually ((2.88+2.93)/2)/5.5) 
assuming a value of life of $5.5 million 
(Table 25). The reduction in risk for the 
benefits of on-package nutrition labels 
for ground or chopped products to equal 
their cost is about ten times greater (5.34 
lives saved annually). 
The estimated total reduction in risk 
in order for the benefits of these 
combined measures to exceed costs is 
5.87 lives saved annually or about one- 
ninth (5.87/50.1) of the estimated 50.1 
lives saved annually under the 
composite scenario, using a value of life 
saved of $5.5 million.

13. 
E. Analysis of Alternatives 
The previous discussion of regulatory 
alternatives provided a description of 
the regulatory alternative considered 
and information on the likely costs of 
the alternatives. The analysis that 
follows provides a quantification of the 
potential effectiveness of the 
alternatives as well as a comparison of 
cost-effectiveness and potential net 
benefits. 
The regulatory alternatives considered 
by the Agency employ one or both of the 
following measures: POP nutrition 
information and on-package nutrition 
labels. The combination of measures 
and the products subject to these 
measures differ among the regulatory 
alternatives considered. In the 
supplemental proposed rule 
(Alternative 3), on-package nutrition 
labels are required for ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products 
(unless an exemption applies), and on- 
package nutrition labels or POP 
nutrition information are required for 
the major cuts of single ingredient, raw 
meat and poultry products (unless an 
exemption applies). It is assumed for the 
purpose of estimating compliance costs 
that, given the option, retail 
establishments will provide POP 
information in the form of placards to 
convey nutrition information for major 
cuts of single ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products. Alternative 2 
stipulates POP nutrition information for 
ground or chopped product and for 
major and nonmajor cuts of single 
ingredient, raw products. It is assumed 
for purposes of estimating the cost of 
this alternative that retail 
establishments will use a reference 
manual to convey nutrition information 
for the products covered. Retailers may 
employ other methods, however. 
Alternative 4 requires on-package 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
products and major cuts. Alternative 5 
stipulates on-package nutrition labels 
for ground or chopped product, and 
both major and nonmajor cuts of single 
ingredient raw products. 
Relative Effectiveness in Providing the 
Necessary Material Facts 
The Agency considered several factors 
in selecting Alternative 3. The factors 
reflect the significant differences in the 
two principal categories of meat and 
poultry products— ground or chopped 
products and major and nonmajor cuts, 
consumer preferences, and the 
effectiveness with which information 
about these two categories of products is 
presented in retail establishments. 
Differences in product characteristics, 
consumer preferences, and demand for 
nutrition information affect the value of 
nutrition information for the two 
general categories of products. The 
justification for the government action 
in requiring nutrition information 
differs for the two categories of 
products, as has been argued in the need 
for the rule. Different approaches to 
labeling may be warranted and what 
might be an effective approach for

providing nutrition information for one 
category may be unsuitable for the 
other. FSIS finds that this is the case, 
based on the full range of evidence 
available. 
Ground or chopped product are 
formulated to achieve a specific fat 
content and thus are similar to multi- 
ingredient and heat processed products, 
which receive on-package nutrition 
labels. The nutritional characteristics of 
these products can vary significantly. 
For example, the percentage of total fat 
in ground beef may range from 3 to 30 
percent. Consequently, consumers have 
a significant number of choices 
concerning type of product and 
nutritional characteristics. Nutrition 
information enables consumers to match 
product choices with nutritional 
preferences. 
While the processor formulating the 
ground or chopped product has 
knowledge of the nutritional 
characteristics of each product 
formulation, such information is not 
readily available to the consumer. 
Significant differences in total fat 
content of ground and chopped 
products may be difficult for the 
consumer to distinguish. Consequently, 
there is little incentive for processors to 
provide information on ground or 
chopped products with higher fat 
content. Yet, consumers’ information 
needs are significant, given the 
differences in consumer preferences for 
high fat and low fat products. Under 
these conditions, readily accessible 
nutrition information would be highly 
valued by consumers. FSIS has 
concluded that clear and concise 
information should be available to 
consumers of ground or chopped 
product in the form of an on-package 
label. It would be confusing to 
consumers if nutrition information were 
provided by POP placards for all 
potential formulations of these 
products. Faced with a large array of 
signage, the potential value of nutrition 
information could be exceeded by the 
transactions cost for many consumers 
seeking such information. 
Because there are numerous 
formulations of ground or chopped 
product, it would be difficult for 
producers or retailers to develop POP 
materials that would address all the 
different formulations that exist for 
these products. Furthermore, it would 
be difficult for consumers to find the 
correct information for a specific ground 
or chopped product on POP materials 
that include information concerning 
numerous formulations of these 
products (66 FR 4977, January 18, 2001). 
If a statement of the fat percentage and 
lean percentage were not included on a 
package of ground product, consumers 
would not know which nutrient data 
concerning ground product on POP 
materials would apply to that particular 
ground product. Thus, FSIS on-package 
nutrition labels would likely enable 
consumers to make product 
comparisons far more efficiently 
because consumers would have more 
relevant information directly attached to 
the products to inform their choices. 
Major cuts are generally considered 
by consumers to be largely 
undifferentiated products in terms of 
nutrient content (Van Ravenswaay). The 
nutritional characteristics of one beef 
chuck blade roast are perceived to be 
much the same as another. The 
differences in nutritional characteristics 
for a particular major cut (e.g., chicken 
breasts) vary much less than the 
nutritional characteristics for a type of 
ground or chopped product (USDA, 
2005). This is an important factor to 
consider as consumer preferences are 
more likely to differ on the basis of the 
type of major cut (e.g., chicken breasts 
versus pork loin chops). 
Based on the similarity of nutritional 
attributes of any specific major cut and 
the type of information desired by 
consumers, FSIS has concluded that it 
would be acceptable for retail 
establishments to provide nutrition 
information via POP placards for major 
cuts. They are an efficient means of 
providing such information given the 
relatively small number of products sold 
at retail establishments, their relatively 
large share of total meat and poultry 
consumption, and consumer 
information needs. 
In developing the regulatory 
alternatives, the Agency concluded that, 
given the option, retail establishments 
would most likely not choose to provide 
nutrition information for nonmajor cuts 
via POP placards. There are potentially 
a large number of such products (350 
products for meat alone according to the 
National Live Stock Meat Board). Using 
POP placards to convey nutritional 
information on these products could 
result in excessive signage at retail 
establishments. Excessive signage 
would not only be a concern for the 
retail establishment, but also would not 
convey information in a manner that 
would promote its usage by consumers. 
Retail establishments would be more 
likely to opt for providing nutrition 
information for nonmajor cuts in a 
reference manual. The following table 
summarizes factors considered by the 
Agency in its selection of Alternative 3 
as the most effective in providing the 
material information to consumers.

NLEA. So, most POP research is now 
quite dated. Thus, the research available 
does not allow FSIS to make a precise 
comparison of the relative success of on- 
package nutrition labels versus POP 
nutrition information. However, POP 
nutrition information may be a 
convenient and effective means for 
consumers to confirm or gain new 
information on the nutritional content 
of the major or nonmajor cuts of single 
ingredient, raw products. Given these 
uncertainties, in the analysis that 
follows, FSIS assumes that POP 
nutrition information is 50 percent, 10 
percent and 5 percent as successful as 
on-package nutrition labels in causing 
dietary change to illustrate the impacts 
of those assumptions on the relative 
cost-effectiveness as well as net benefits 
of the alternatives. 
Analysis of Cost Effectiveness 
A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) 
provides a means to identify alternatives 
that achieve the most effective use of 
resources available without requiring 
the monetization of all benefits or costs 
by comparing regulatory alternatives 
with respect to their ability to achieve 
a specified outcome (e.g., units of 
human or environmental health). 
Regulatory alternatives employing the 
same measures are ordered on the basis 
of the increased frequency, scope, 
lethality, or some other criterion. 
Ideally, a CEA results in comparison of 
the incremental cost per unit of outcome 
for each regulatory alternative when the 
alternatives are ordered on the basis of 
an increasing level of the specified 
criterion. 
FSIS agrees that cost effectiveness 
ratios for regulatory options should be 
calculated incrementally, that is, in 
terms of the additional cost incurred by 
the next most stringent option to 
produce an additional life saved. 
However, the data available for the 
analysis and the nature of the regulatory 
alternatives poses some challenges to 
conducting a meaningful incremental 
CEA. First, the regulatory alternatives 
stipulate the use of one or two measures 
that may be employed for providing 
nutrition information for two or three 
categories of products—ground or 
chopped product and single-ingredient 
raw products (major and nonmajor 
cuts)—of meat and poultry. The two 
measures are POP nutrition information 
materials and on-package nutrition 
labels. Second, the effectiveness of POP 
nutrition information relative to on- 
package nutrition labels is uncertain. 
The greater amount of time required by 
the consumer to find the relevant 
nutrition information on POP materials 
relative to finding such information on 
the packaging of the products suggests 
that POP nutrition information may be 
less successful for some types of 
products in leading to healthier dietary 
choices. Given the assumptions we 
make in order to model the regulatory 
provisions given the uncertain 
effectiveness, the result is an 
incremental cost-effectiveness analysis 
which shows that multiple alternatives 
are weakly dominated under all 
scenarios. Consequently, the analysis 
that follows provides a comparison of 
average cost-effectiveness and net- 
benefits of the regulatory alternatives for 
each alternative, for different levels of 
assumed relative effectiveness of POP 
information. 
Average Cost-Effectiveness of 
Regulatory Alternatives 
Cost-effectiveness analysis results 
based on averages can be misleading in 
that the regulatory alternative exhibiting 
the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio may 
not be the best option. Low ratios are 
not always an accurate indicator of high 
net social benefits, the desired economic 
objective. The following provides 
information on the average cost 
effectiveness of the regulatory 
alternatives and their net benefits. 
In order to analyze both the average 
cost effectiveness of the regulatory 
alternatives and incremental cost 
effectiveness of the measures employed 
by the regulatory alternatives, the share 
of the reduction in risk associated with 
the POP nutrition information for 
ground and chopped products and both 
major and nonmajor cuts are estimated. 
Estimates of the number of products 
subject to on-package nutrition labeling 
are also provided. The costs 
corresponding to the risk reduction 
measures are also estimated. Table 26 
provides the information that was used 
to allocate the annualized costs and 
reductions in risk. 
The reductions in risk associated with 
the regulatory alternatives reflect the 
differences in the pounds of product 
affected. Alternatives 2 and 5 affect 
ground and chopped products and the

major and nonmajor cuts, a total of 24.5 
billion pounds (Table 26). Alternative 3 
(the supplemental proposed rule) 
requires on-package nutrition labels for 
ground or chopped products and either 
on-package nutrition labels or POP 
nutrition information for the major cuts, 
a total of 21.6 billion pounds. 
Alternative 4 affects the same amount of 
product as Alternative 3. The 
differences in pounds of products 
affected among the regulatory 
alternatives are reflected in the annual 
number of lives saved. The potential 
number of lives saved annually for 
Alternatives 2 and 5 are increased 
proportionately by 13 percent (24.5/21.6 
= 1.1343) to reflect the difference in 
pounds of product affected. Therefore, 
the maximum number of lives saved 
annually for Alternatives 3 and 4 is 
50.1. The corresponding value for 
Alternative 2 and 5 is 56.8 lives saved 
annually (50.1 × 1.1343). 
The total cost of Alternative 2, which 
is exclusively the cost of the POP 
nutrition information manual, is 
allocated among ground and chopped 
product, and major and nonmajor cuts 
on the basis of the share of products in 
these categories (CFR §§ 317.344 and 
381.444, National Livestock Meat Board, 
1995). The costs associated with 
labeling measures for the product 
categories (on-package nutrition labels 
for ground and chopped and major cuts, 
and on-package labels for these products 
plus nonmajor cuts for Alternatives 4 
and 5, respectively) are allocated on the 
basis of the relative shares of these 
products at retail establishments.

1 A comprehensive listing of nonmajor cuts was provided in the Uniform Retail Meat Identity Standards published by the National Livestock and 
Meat Board. Nonmajor cuts of poultry, of which there are few, are not included. Amenable kinds of poultry are not accounted for. Most ducks, 
geese, squab are sold as carcasses and there is only a very small market for ostrich cuts/parts; and rhea and emu are used for byproducts 
mostly. 
The present value and corresponding 
annualized costs for the regulatory 
alternatives and their measures are 
shown in Table 27. There are no costs 
associated with Alternative 1 as it 
represents the status quo. As is reflected 
in their costs, the alternatives become 
increasingly costly due to the increasing 
share and number of products that 
receive on-package nutrition labels, 
which are significantly more costly than 
POP nutrition information. The present 
value cost of the alternatives range from 
a low of $87.74 million for Alternative 
2 to $956.48 million for Alternative 5. 
The present value of the compliance 
costs of the alternative selected by the 
Agency is $348.06 million. The table 
also shows the compliance costs, both 
present value and annualized, on the 
basis of the major product categories.

43 This value reflects the relative success of POP 
nutrition information relative to on-package labels. 
This value will change according to the scenario 
being discussed. 
44 The analysis assumes that the manual 
containing the nutrition information as specified for 
Alternative 2 and the POP nutrition information 
placards specified in Alternative 3 have the same 
impact on consumer dietary patterns. The use of a 
nutrition information reference manual is assumed 
to be the manner by which retail establishments 
would convey nutrition information under 
Alternative 2.

Note: These compliance costs do not take into account the level of voluntary compliance with the labeling required under each alternative. 
Consequently, the estimated compliance costs are overstated. 
The lives saved associated with the 
nutrition labeling measures for ground 
or chopped products, and major and 
nonmajor cuts are based on the amount 
of product affected by the measures for 
each of the regulatory alternatives. For 
example, 16.7 billion pounds of major 
cuts are affected by POP nutrition 
information placards under Alternative 
3 (Table 26). On-package nutrition 
labels are required for the 4.9 billion 
pounds of ground and chopped meat 
and poultry products affected by 
Alternative 3. The average annual 30.74 
(19.37 + 11.37) lives saved as a result of 
this alternative, assuming POP nutrition 
information is 50 percent as successful 
as on-package nutrition labels in 
causing dietary change, is obtained as 
follows. The average annual lives saved 
as a result POP nutrition information for 
major cuts is 19.4 lives as shown in 
Table 28 (16.7/21.6 = 0.77; (0.77 × 50.1) 
× .5 43 = 19.4). On-package nutrition 
labels for ground or chopped products 
account for the remaining 11.4 lives 
saved annually (4.9/21.6 = .227; .227 × 
50.1 = 11.4). 
Table 28 shows the cost-effectiveness 
of the regulatory alternatives when POP 
nutrition information is assumed to be 
half as successful as on-package 
nutrition labels in bringing about 
healthier diets and reducing coronary 
heart disease and cancer. This success 
rate is considered to be an upper bound. 
The cost per life saved for Alternative 3 
is $1.069 million, when using the 
composite annual average and 
annualized costs based on a 7 percent 
discount rate. The cost per life saved for 
on-package nutrition labels for ground 
or chopped products under this 
alternative is $2.63 million ($29.92 
million from Table 27/11.37 lives saved 
annually, column 1 of Table 28) and 
$151,000 for POP nutrition information 
placards under this alternative ($2.93 
million from Table 27/19.37 lives saved 
annually). 
As would be expected under this 
scenario, Alternative 4 and 5 are less 
cost effective than the supplemental 
proposed rule measures because they 
rely entirely on the relatively more 
costly measures of on-package nutrition 
labels. Alternative 2 has a lower cost- 
effectiveness ratio in this scenario 
because of the assumed high rate of 
success for POP nutrition information 
and because it relies entirely on a low- 
cost POP reference manual.44 Using an 
average VSL of $5.5 million, all 
alternatives show large average annual 
benefits relative to annual costs with 
Alternative 5 yielding the highest net 
benefits.

Note: These estimates do not take into account the level of voluntary compliance with the labeling required under each alternative. Con-
sequently, the estimated compliance costs as well as potential lives saved are overstated. 
Tables 29 and 30 show the impact on 
the cost effectiveness of Alternatives 2 
and 3, and their respective measures, 
when POP nutrition information is 10 
and 5 percent as successful, 
respectively, as on-package nutrition 
labels in leading to dietary changes. The 
cost effectiveness of Alternatives 4 and 
5 are not affected as they do not employ 
POP nutrition information. 
Consequently, their effectiveness ratios 
and net benefits are unchanged from 
Table 28. 
The results show that as the success 
of POP nutrition information declines 
relative to on-package nutrition labels, 
the cost-effectiveness measures for 
Alternative 2 decline more rapidly than 
those for Alternative 3, given the second 
alternative’s entire reliance on POP 
nutrition information. When POP 
nutrition information is 10 percent as 
successful as on-package nutrition 
information labels (Table 29), the 
average cost-effectiveness for 
Alternatives 2 through 5 are 
approximately the same (between $1.5 
to $2.2 million per life saved). While the 
average cost-effectiveness ratios of the 
regulatory alternatives are 
approximately the same, the annual net 
benefits of the alternatives differ 
significantly. This measure ranges from 
$23 million for Alternative 2 to 10 times 
that amount for Alternative 5 (Table 26). 
It should be noted that the cost per life 
saved associated with POP nutrition 
information for nonmajor cuts of single 
ingredient, raw meat and poultry 
products under Alternative 2 exceeds 
the value of a life saved and, 
consequently, the annual benefits 
associated with the measure are less 
than the annual costs.

Note: These estimates do not take into account the level of voluntary compliance with the labeling required under each alternative. Con-
sequently, the estimated compliance costs as well as potential lives saved are overstated. 
When POP nutrition information is 5 
percent as successful as on-package 
nutrition information labels (Table 30), 
the average cost-effectiveness ratio for 
Alternative 2 is higher than those for the 
other alternatives and 15 percent higher 
than that for Alternative 3. The annual 
net benefit of POP nutrition information 
for ground or chopped product under 
Alternative 2 is declining to marginal 
levels. The annual net benefit for 
Alternative 3 is nearly $40.3 million, 
about 5 times that for Alternative 2. 
Due to the differences in search costs 
for consumers using a POP reference 
manual versus a POP placard, 
Alternative 2 is expected to be less 
successful than Alternative 3 in 
changing dietary patterns. If POP 
manuals were 5 percent as successful as 
on-package labels and placards were 10 
percent as effective as on-package 
labels, a plausible scenario, the cost per 
life saved for Alternative 3 would be 
about 75 percent (2.156/2.915) of that 
for Alternative 2. The number of lives 
saved annually under Alternative 3 
would be about 5 times (15.2/2.8) that 
found under Alternative 2. The 
uncertainty associated with the success 
of a POP reference manual (Alternative 
2) is an important factor supporting the 
effectiveness of Alternative 3 and the 
Agency’s decision to select this 
alternative relative to Alternative 2.

Summary of Analysis of Alternatives 
The analysis shows that the POP 
information does not need to be highly 
successful for its benefits to exceed its 
costs, even at low levels of success 
relative to on-package nutrition labels. 
FSIS finds that the measures required 
in the supplemental proposed rule are 
generally more effective than the other 
alternatives when all the qualitative and 
quantitative evidence is considered. As 
has been discussed above in this 
section, FSIS finds that on-package 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
product are more effective than POP 
nutrition information in informing 
consumers about the nutritional 
characteristics of these products, given 
the nature of the product, its 
presentation in the retail environment, 
and consumer behavior. FSIS also finds 
that POP nutrition placards are an 
effective means for informing 
consumers about the nutritional 
characteristics of major cuts of single 
ingredient, raw products for these same 
reasons. 
F. Summary of Costs and Benefits of the 
Final Nutrition Labeling Rule 
FSIS estimates that for the 
supplemental proposed rule, the 
discounted average present value of 
benefits over a 20-year period using a 7 
percent discount rate will be $2.2 
billion and using a 3 percent discount 
rate will be $3.7 billion, using a 
composite of three scenarios for the 
effectiveness of nutrition labels and 
three values for reducing a premature 
death. The corresponding average 
annual benefits are $205.5 million and 
$248.3 million (See summary Table 
30b). 
The discounted average present value 
costs, over a 20-year period, are 
estimated to be $348.06 million using a 
7 percent discount rate and $472.23 
million using a 3 percent discount rate. 
The corresponding annualized average 
costs are $32.8 and $31.7 million (See 
summary table 30b and Appendix D, 
Tables 1 and 2). 
After taking into account the current 
assumed levels of compliance with the 
supplemental proposed rule measures, 
the average present value costs of the 
rule decline to $115.45 million and 
$156.72 million when using a 7 percent 
and 3 percent discount rate, 
respectively. The corresponding 
annualized average costs are $10.9 and 
$10.5 million. The average present 
values of the benefits are $0.800 billion 
and $1.358 billion using 7 and 3 percent 
discount rates, respectively. The 
corresponding average annual benefits 
are $75.5 million and $91.3 million. 
Table 30c provides a summary of these 
annualized costs and benefits. These 
estimates suggest that under plausible 
assumptions, the impact of this rule in 
any given year may be less than $100 
million. However, given the 
uncertainties in the analysis, this action 
is deemed ‘‘economically significant’’. 
Not included in the quantitative 
analysis were other likely benefits to 
providing nutrition labeling: increased 
profits received by food retailers and 
manufacturers, and consumers buy 
products with the attributes they want. 
FSIS believes that the labeling 
provisions help consumers make better 
food choices and provide incentives to 
producers to continue producing 
nutritionally-improved products that 
contribute substantially to the health 
benefits associated with nutrition 
labeling. If diet quality associations 
found with all other labeled foods do 
not hold up for nutrition labels on meat, 
then health benefits in the FSIS report 
are overestimated. Of course, health 
benefits are only one way in which 
benefits might be realized. Consumers 
might choose to use nutritional 
information to enhance enjoyment of 
food, and not to raise their health status. 
Further, they may be better off than if 
they had raised their health status since 
rational consumers will use information 
to their best advantage. If we observe 
rational, well-informed consumers 
selecting a more enjoyable diet, for these 
consumers a more enjoyable diet was 
worth more than better health. Thus, 
when we restrict benefits estimates to 
allow only for information to be used to 
advance health status, we are 
simultaneously restricting estimated 
benefits to a lower level of value to 
consumers. The FSIS analysis imposes 
that restriction and the resulting 
benefits estimate must therefore be 
interpreted as an underestimate of 
overall benefits. The estimated costs of 
the rule’s nutrition labeling 
requirements appear to be justified by 
the estimated benefits.

Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)— 
Assessment 
Based on the cost analysis above, FSIS 
has made a tentative determination that 
this rule would not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities, as defined by 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 
601). The supplemental proposed rule 
would affect meat and poultry 
processing establishments producing 
ground or chopped products (Table 1 
and 2) and retail firms and 
establishments (Tables 3 and 4). There 
are approximately 3,073 potentially 
affected Federal and State processing 
establishments and 47,688 potentially 
affected retail firms with 74,910 retail 
establishments. A ‘‘firm’’ refers to the 
parent company and an ‘‘establishment’’ 
refers to the retail facility. Processing 
establishments that grind or chop meat 
and poultry will be potentially affected. 
There are 1,433 very small, 858 small, 
and 109 large Federal establishments 
that produce ground or chopped 
products, based on PBIS (April, 2006). 
The final regulatory analysis assumes 
that no small processor is independent. 
That is, all (regardless of their size) are 
part of a larger organization. Table 13 
shows the undiscounted costs of about 
$53.80 million for all the affected 
processing establishments. 
FSIS does not believe that any very 
small operations will be affected by the 
regulation because very small meat and 
poultry operations employ nine or fewer 
employees. These establishments would 
find it difficult to produce over 100,000 
pounds per ground product annually 
because these employees also process 
other products. Annual revenues 
associated with 100,000 pounds of 
annual ground beef total approximately 
$230,000 for 85 percent lean ground 
beef, based on a retail value of $2.30 per 
pound (Agricultural Marketing Service, 
Market Reports, September 2009). Some 
small establishments are also likely to 
be exempt from the regulation because 
they have 500 or fewer employees, or 
are owned by companies with 500 or 
fewer employees, and FSIS assumes 
they produce less than 100,000 pounds 
annually of each ground product. FSIS 
researched this issue to better address 
the number of establishments that 
would be affected but does not have 
better data on corporations that own 
these individual establishments. 
However, as discussed earlier in the 
final regulatory analysis, RTI made the 
assumption that Federally-inspected 
processing establishments generally are 
a part of a larger organization that own, 
on average, three establishments each. 
In addition, based on PBIS (April 2006), 
there are 41 state-inspected processing 
establishments (Table 2) that are owned 
by 41 firms. Therefore, there are about 
899 (858 + 41) small processing 
establishments that are affected by the 
supplemental proposed rule. 
As part of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Assessment, FSIS also examined the 
impact of the supplemental proposed 
rule, by altering certain assumptions, to

45 Although RTI, in their analysis stated that all 
of these businesses are large, for this analysis, FSIS 
is altering the assumption in order to determine the 
impact (measure the sensitivity) of a set of 
alternative assumptions. 
46 RTI believes that all of these businesses will be 
exempt from nutrition labeling requirements. For 
purposes of conducting a sensitivity analysis, this 
analysis assumes that they are small for purposes 
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and that they will 
not qualify for the small business exemption. 
determine whether the supplemental 
proposed rule could have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities. Therefore, even though FSIS 
believes that small processors would 
find it difficult to produce over 100,000 
pounds per ground product annually 
because these employees also process 
other products, FSIS estimated the cost 
to small grinders if they were not 
exempt from nutrition labeling 
requirements. For purposes of this 
alternative analysis, it is assumed that 
all 899 small processing firms will be 
affected by this regulation.45 Also, based 
on the analysis for the supplemental 
proposed rule, there are 6.6 frozen or 
fresh ground meat or chopped meat and 
poultry products produced per 
company. For this alternative analysis, 
it is assumed that there are 5,933 
(899 × 6.6) unique ground or chopped 
products. FSIS estimates that the one- 
time average costs of modifying product 
labels on prepackaged ground or 
chopped products to include nutrition 
information at processing 
establishments will be $13.33 million 
($2,247 per label modification costs × 
896 affected companies × 6.6 affected 
products per company) using average 
cost estimates. The annualized cost over 
20 years at 7 percent is $1.26 million. 
On a per company basis the annualized 
cost over 20 years is about $1,402 ($1.26 
million/896). 
In addition to the one-time costs of 
designing labels, processing 
establishments will also incur added 
costs of larger labels. Again, it is 
assumed that there are 899 small 
processing establishments that grind or 
chop meat and poultry, and that all 
these establishments are small 
businesses. Based on a study conducted 
by NCBA, 25 percent of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry packages are 
packaged at processing establishments. 
As explained above, approximately 
437.5 million packages of ground and 
chopped meat and poultry products are 
packed by processing establishments 
each year. There are no data available to 
estimate the number of packages of 
ground or chopped meat or poultry 
products packaged by these small 
establishments, but (for purposes of this 
analysis) if 25 percent of all of the 
packages originate at small 
establishments, then these 899 
companies package 109.4 million 
packages annually (437.5 million × .25). 
Multiplying 109.4 million packages by 
0.5 cents per label (RTI, 2003) results in 
an annual cost of $547,000 (109.4 
million packages × $0.005) or about 
$509 per company. In total, FSIS 
estimates that (under the alternative set 
of assumptions that all small entities 
will be affected by this supplemental 
proposed rule and that they package 25 
percent of the total) the cost to these 899 
small companies (assuming that they 
package 25 percent of the total) will be 
about $1,616 ($1,107 + $509) per 
company on an annualized basis using 
a 7 percent discount rate. 
If, on the other hand, 50 percent of all 
packages from processing 
establishments originate at the small 
establishments, then these 899 
companies package about 219 million 
packages annually. Multiplying 219 
million packages by $0.005 per label 
results in an annual cost of $1,095,000 
or $1,218 per company. In total, FSIS 
estimates that the cost to 899 small 
companies (under the alternative set of 
assumptions that all small entities will 
be affected by this supplemental 
proposed rule and that they package 50 
percent of the total) will be about $2,126 
per company ($1,402 + $1,218) on an 
annualized basis discounted at 7 
percent. 
Small retail stores will incur the cost 
of providing POP nutrition information 
for the major cuts. There are 47,422 
small retail firms that own 51,431 small 
retail stores that would be required to 
provide POP information for the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw products. 
FSIS estimates that the cost to a retail 
store for placards will be $10.56 for 
labor plus $65.17 for materials or 
approximately $75.73 per store. The 
annualized cost, assuming that the 
placards have to be replaced every two 
years, is about $41.88 using a 7 percent 
discount rate. All retail stores, including 
small and very small businesses will 
incur these costs. FSIS believes that 
these costs are not significant—even for 
very small businesses. 
Retail stores will also incur costs 
related to required nutrition labels for 
ground or chopped products. For this 
analysis, it is assumed that they will all 
comply by following Option 1 (the less 
costly printing method for labels) 
because it is the least costly. Based upon 
the information contained in the 
regulatory analysis, a total of 74,910 
establishments owned by 47,688 firms 
could potentially be affected. However, 
23,479 establishments owned by 266 
firms are considered to be large 
according to the 2002 Economic Census. 
If they grind or chop over 100,000 
pounds of a particular product annually, 
then as many as 51,431 small 
establishments owned by 47,422 firms 
could potentially be affected.46 
For these establishments, it is 
assumed that there would be only one 
scale-printer system instead of the 1.5 
scale-printer systems that was assumed 
in the regulatory analysis. Therefore, the 
average cost of upgrading scale-printer 
systems is estimated at $1,600, and this 
cost would be incurred by these 
businesses once every five years. FSIS 
estimates that the annualized cost, since 
scale-printer systems need to be 
replaced every 5 years, is about $390 
using a 7 percent discount rate. 
Operating and maintenance costs are 
estimated at 6 percent (See 
supplemental PRIA for detailed 
explanation) or $96 annually. Therefore, 
the sum of the annualized maintenance 
costs at 7 percent is estimated at $486 
annually per establishment ($390 + 
$96). 
The average cost of redesigning larger 
store labels and conducting nutrition 
analysis is estimated at $2,247. 
However, many firms have more than 
one establishment so the cost per 
establishment will be much lower. 
Assuming that each establishment had 
to redesign its store labels for 4.6 
products and conduct nutrition analysis 
for each unique product, then the added 
annualized cost over 20 years is 
estimated at $766 using a 7 percent 
discount rate. 
The use of larger labels is another cost 
that these retail stores will incur. As 
explained above, an estimated 1.75 
billion packages of ground or chopped 
meat or poultry products are sold at 
large retail facilities. Therefore, 460 
million packages of ground or chopped 
products are sold at small retail 
establishments. Given that 51,431 small 
retail establishments could be affected, 
then each small establishment (460 
million packages/51,431 establishments) 
sells 8,039 packages annually. If the 
added average cost of each label is 
$0.005, then each retail store will incur 
an added cost of about $40 annually 
($8,039 packages per establishment × 
.005). 
FSIS estimates that using a 7 percent 
discount rate the sum of the annual/ 
annualized cost to each retail 
establishment will be $42 for nutrition 
information placards, $486 for 
upgrading and maintaining scale-printer 
systems, $969 for redesigning larger 
store logo labels, and $40 for using 
larger labels. The total annual/

annualized cost using a 7 percent 
discount rate will be $1,537. FSIS also 
estimates that using a 3 percent 
discount rate the total annual/ 
annualized cost using a 3 percent 
discount rate will be $1,216. In 
summary, FSIS concludes from using an 
alternate set of assumptions, that this 
supplemental proposed rule would not 
have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
FSIS is cognizant of the possibility 
that while exempted establishments 
would not have to incur labeling costs, 
they also might not realize the benefits 
of increased sales of the nutritionally 
labeled products. This is because if 
demand for the labeled product 
increases relative to demand for non- 
labeled products, the exempt 
establishments would lose their market 
shares to the nonexempt establishments 
producing nutritionally labeled 
products. Therefore, to keep their 
market shares, these exempt 
establishments are likely to voluntarily 
include nutrition information on the 
product label. Such a strategy would 
minimize any adverse impact on these 
smaller establishments. It would, 
however, also increase their labeling 
costs. Economic theory dictates that 
these establishments would compare the 
costs of nutrition labels with the 
benefits of retaining their market shares 
and would decide to label their 
products if the benefits of increasing the 
market shares exceed the label costs. 
Nutrition labeling would be required, 
either on the product label or on POP 
materials, for the major cuts. Therefore, 
if manufacturers do not provide 
nutrition information on the label, 
retailers would be required to provide 
this information at the POP or on 
product labels. However, as noted 
above, this requirement should not 
impose major costs or other burdens. 
The annual/annualized cost to each 
retail establishment will be $42 for 
nutrition information placards. 
The economic impact on retail stores 
is likely to be minimal because recently 
there has been consolidation of these 
stores as a consequence of mergers and 
acquisitions, resulting in an increased 
market share of large retailers relative to 
small ones. For example, several years 
ago Royal Ahold, the Dutch 
Conglomerate, bought out Giant Food. 
Also, Ahold announced the pending 
purchase of Supermarket General-II 
Holdings Corporation, parent of the 
Pathmark chain. Similarly, 
SUPERVALUE acquired Richfood, Food 
Lion bought out Hannaford Brothers and 
Scarborough, and Albertson’s purchased 
American Stores. (Sean Mehegan, 
‘‘Consolidation Changes the Face of the 
North American Supermarket Sector,’’ 
Meat & Poultry (September 1999): 22– 
25). More recently, Wal-Mart through its 
operation Wal-Mart Puerto Rico agreed 
to acquire Supermercados Amigo, the 
leading supermarket chain in Puerto 
Rico. These mergers and acquisitions 
are likely to increase market shares of 
the large retailers at the cost of smaller 
ones. 
Based on the 2002 Economic Census 
of the U.S. Department of Commerce, 
meat and poultry processing 
establishments that are small entities 
had annual revenues from total value of 
shipments that ranged from $0.454 
million to $96.038 million. For each 
processing (grinding) establishment, 
average costs as a percent of revenues 
range from a lower bound of 0.001 
percent ($1,402/$96.038 million to an 
upper bound of 0.3 percent ($1,402/ 
$0.454 million). Further, small entity 
retail stores (supermarkets and other 
grocery (except convenience) stores and 
meat market stores) had annual 
revenues from sales that ranged from 
$0.343 million to $8.873 million. Also, 
the companies or firms of the small 
retail stores had annual revenues from 
sales that ranged from $0.343 million to 
$48.342 million. Costs as a percent of 
revenues range from the lower bound of 
0.02 percent ($1,537/$8.873 million) to 
the upper bound of 0.4 percent ($1,537/ 
$0.343 million). Many of these retail 
firms that are small entities own 
multiple retail stores that are small 
entity supermarkets and other grocery 
(except convenience) stores. 
The following table shows the 
upfront, first year costs for all 
businesses affected by the rule, 
compared to the first year, upfront costs 
for small businesses. The table also 
shows the percent of total first year 
costs of the rule that will be incurred by 
small businesses. Based on the cost 
estimates for the rule, assuming retailers 
choose Option 1 for labeling ground or 
chopped products, small businesses will 
incur 10.1 percent of total estimated 
first year costs.

Executive Order 12988 
This supplemental proposed rule has 
been reviewed under Executive Order 
12988, Civil Justice Reform. States and 
local jurisdictions are preempted by the 
Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and 
the Poultry Products Inspection Act 
(PPIA) from imposing any marking, 
labeling, packaging, or ingredient 
requirements on Federally inspected 
meat and poultry products that are in 
addition to, or different than, those 
imposed under the FMIA or the PPIA. 
However, States and local jurisdictions 
may exercise concurrent jurisdiction 
over meat and poultry products that are 
outside official establishments for the 
purpose of preventing the distribution 
of meat and poultry products that are 
misbranded or adulterated under the 
FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of 
imported articles, which are not at such 
an establishment, after their entry into 
the United States. 
The supplemental proposed rule 
would not be intended to have 
retroactive effect. 
Administrative proceedings would 
not be required before parties may file 
suit in court challenging this rule. 
However, the administrative procedures 
specified in §§ 306.5 and 381.35 must be 
exhausted before there is any judicial 
challenge of the application of the rule, 
if the challenge involves any decision of 
an FSIS employee relating to inspection 
services provided under FMIA and 
PPIA. 
Paperwork Requirements 
Title: Nutrition labeling of ground or 
chopped meat and poultry products and 
single-ingredient products. 
Type of Collection: New. 
Abstract: FSIS has reviewed the 
paperwork and record keeping 
requirements in this supplemental 
proposed rule in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act. Should this 
rule become final, FSIS will require 
several information collection and 
recordkeeping activities. FSIS will 
requiring nutrition labeling on the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products, either on their label or 
at their POP, unless an exemption 
applies. If the manufacturer provides 
nutrition information on the label of 
individual packages of the major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw meat or poultry 
products, the retailer would not be 
required to provide the information at 
the POP. However, if the manufacturer 
does not provide the nutrition 
information on the label of these 
products, the retailer would be required 
to provide the information at their POP. 
In the estimate of burden below, FSIS is 
calculating that all retailers would 
display POP information for the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat and 
poultry products, because this is a low- 
cost means of providing nutrition 
information for multiple products, and 
because this rule will not require that 
manufacturers include nutrition labels 
on the major cuts of single-ingredient, 
raw meat and poultry products. FSIS is 
also requiring nutrition labels on all 
ground or chopped meat and poultry 
products, with or without added 
seasonings, unless an exemption 
applies. 
Estimate of burden: FSIS estimates 
that obtaining POP materials and 
making them available for consumers 
would take an average of 30 minutes. 
FSIS believes that the nutrition 
information on most POP materials will 
be based on the most current 
representative database values 
contained in USDA’s National Nutrient 
Data Bank or the USDA National 
Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference. FSIS also believes it is 
unlikely that there will be any nutrition 
claims made on the POP materials on 
the basis of the representative data base 
values. Therefore, these products will 
not be subject to FSIS compliance 
review, and there will be no 
recordkeeping requirements based on 
this information. 
FSIS estimates that developing 
nutrition labels for ground or chopped 
products would take an average of 6 
hours. Labels developed at official 
establishments would be submitted to 
FSIS. FSIS estimates that each official 
establishment that produces ground or 
chopped product would submit 6.6 
labels to FSIS for approval. FSIS 
estimates that it would take an average 
of 1.5 hours to prepare and submit the 
form for prior approval. All ground or 
chopped product would be subject to 
FSIS compliance review; therefore, 
producers of ground or chopped 
product would be required to maintain 
records to support the validity of 
nutrient declarations contained on 
product labels. FSIS estimates the 
average time for recordkeeping would 
be 30 minutes. 
Respondents: Meat and poultry 
establishments and retail stores. 
Estimated number of respondents: 
75,539. 
Estimated number of responses per 
respondent: 18.04. 
Estimated total annual burden on 
respondents: 66,062 hours 
Copies of this information collection 
assessment can be obtained from John 
O’Connell, Paperwork Reduction Act 
Coordinator, Food Safety and Inspection 
Service, USDA, 112 Annex, 300 12th 
St., Washington, DC 20250. Comments 
are invited on: (a) Whether the proposed 
collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of FSIS’s 
functions, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(b) the accuracy of FSIS’s estimate of the 
burden of the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of 
the methodology and assumptions used; 
(c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, 
and clarity of the information to be 
collected; and (d) ways to minimize the 
burden of the collection of information 
on those who are to respond, including 
through the use of appropriate 
automated, electronic, mechanical, or 
other technological collection 
techniques, or other forms of 
information technology. Comments may 
be sent to both John O’Connell, 
Paperwork Reduction Act Coordinator, 
at the address provided above, and the

The revisions read as follows: 
§ 317.345 Nutrition labeling of single- 
ingredient, raw meat products that are not 
ground or chopped products described in 
§ 317.301. 
(a)(1) Nutrition information on the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
meat products identified in § 317.344, 
including those that have been 
previously frozen, is required, either on 
their label or at their point-of-purchase, 
unless exempted under § 317.400. If 
nutrition information is presented on 
the label, it must be provided in 
accordance with § 317.309. If nutrition 
information is presented at the point-of- 
purchase, it must be provided in 
accordance with the provisions of this 
section. 
(2) Nutrition information on single- 
ingredient, raw meat products that are 
not ground or chopped meat products 
described in § 317.301 and are not major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw meat 
products identified in § 317.344, 
including those that have been 
previously frozen, may be provided at 
their point-of-purchase in accordance 
with the provisions of this section or on 
their label, in accordance with the 
provisions of § 317.309. 
(3) A retailer may provide nutrition 
information at the point-of-purchase by 
various methods, such as by posting a 
sign or by making the information 
readily available in brochures, 
notebooks, or leaflet form in close 
proximity to the food. The nutrition 
labeling information may also be 
supplemented by a video, live 
demonstration, or other media. If a 
nutrition claim is made on point-of- 
purchase materials, all of the format and 
content requirements of § 317.309 
apply. However, if only nutrition 
information—and not a nutrition 
claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase 
materials, the requirements of § 317.309 
apply, provided, however: 
(i) The listing of percent of Daily 
Value for the nutrients (except vitamins 
and minerals specified in § 317.309 
(c)(8)) and footnote required by 
§ 317.309(d)(9) may be omitted; and 
(ii) The point-of-purchase materials 
are not subject to any of the format 
requirements. 
* * * * * 
(c) For the point-of-purchase 
materials, the declaration of nutrition 
information may be presented in a 
simplified format as specified in 
§ 317.309(f). 
* * * * * 
8. Section 317.362 is amended by 
adding a new paragraph (f) to read as 
follows: 
§ 317.362 Nutrient content claims for fat, 
fatty acids, and cholesterol content. 
* * * * * 
(f) A statement of the lean percentage 
may be used on the label or in labeling 
of ground or chopped meat products 
described in § 317.301 when the 
product does not meet the criteria for 
‘‘low fat,’’ defined in § 317.362(b)(2), 
provided that a statement of the fat 
percentage is contiguous to and in 
lettering of the same color, size, type, 
and on the same color background, as 
the statement of the lean percentage. 
9. Section 317.400 is amended by: 
a. Revise paragraph (a)(1) introductory 
text. 
b. Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) is amended by 
adding ‘‘, including a single retail 
store,’’ after the phrase ‘‘single-plant 
facility,’’ and by adding, ‘‘, including a 
multi-retail store operation,’’ after 
‘‘company/firm’’. 
c. Paragraph (a)(7)(i) is amended by 
removing the semi-colon and ‘‘and’’ and 
by adding the following at the end of the 
paragraph: 
‘‘, provided, however, that this 
exemption does not apply to ready-to- 
eat ground or chopped meat products 
described in § 317.301 that are packaged 
or portioned at a retail establishment, 
unless the establishment qualifies for an 
exemption under (a)(1);’’.

ground or chopped products described

single-ingredient, raw poultry products 
identified in § 381.444. Nutrition 
labeling must be provided for the major 
cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry 
products identified in § 381.444, either 
in accordance with the provisions of 
§ 381.409 for nutrition labels, or in 
accordance with the provisions of 
§ 381.445 for point-of-purchase 
materials, except as exempted under

require nutrition labeling, including 
ground or chopped poultry products 
described in § 381.401, nutrition 
labeling must be provided in accordance 
with the provisions of § 381.409, except 
as exempted under § 381.500. 
(b) Nutrition labeling may be 
provided for single-ingredient, raw 
poultry products that are not ground or 
chopped poultry products described in 
§ 381.401 and that are not major cuts of 
single-ingredient, raw poultry products 
identified in § 381.444, either in 
accordance with the provisions of 
§ 381.409 for nutrition labels, or in 
accordance with the provisions of 
§ 381.445 for point-of-purchase 
materials. 
12. A new § 381.401 is added to read 
as follows: 
§ 381.401 Required nutrition labeling of 
ground or chopped poultry products. 
Nutrition labels must be provided for 
all ground or chopped poultry (kind) 
with or without added seasonings 
(including, but not limited to, ground 
chicken, ground turkey, and (kind) 
burgers) that are intended for human 
consumption and offered for sale, in 
accordance with the provisions of 
§ 381.409, except as exempted under 
§ 381.500.

f. Paragraph (h)(9) is amended by 
adding, ‘‘that are not ground or chopped 
poultry products described in 
§ 381.401’’ after ‘‘products’’, by 
removing the phrase, ‘‘its published 
form, the Agriculture Handbook No. 8 
series’’, and by adding, in its place, ‘‘its 
released form, the USDA National 
Nutrient Database for Standard 
Reference’’, and by removing the period 
and adding the following at the end of 
the paragraph: ‘‘, as provided in

all products, except that single- 
ingredient, raw products that are not 
ground or chopped poultry products as 
described in § 381.401 may be declared 
on the basis of the product ‘‘as 
consumed.’’ For single-ingredient, raw 
products that are not ground or chopped 
poultry products described in § 381.401, 
if data are based on the product ‘‘as 
consumed,’’ the data must be presented 
in accordance with § 381.445(d). In 
addition to the required declaration on 
the basis of ‘‘as packaged’’ for products 
other than single ingredient, raw 
products that are not ground or chopped 
poultry products as described in 
§ 381.401, the declaration may also be

§ 381.443 [Removed] 
14. Section 381.443 is removed. 
15. Section 381.445 is amended as 
follows: 
a. The section heading and paragraph 
(a) and (c) are revised. 
b. Paragraph (d) is amended by 
removing ‘‘should’’ and adding, in its 
place, ‘‘for products covered in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must’’. 
c. Paragraph (e) is amended by

Agriculture Handbook No. 8 series’’ and 
by adding, in its place, ‘‘its released 
form, the USDA National Nutrient 
Database for Standard Reference.’’ 
d. Paragraph (f) is amended by adding 
‘‘provided’’ after ‘‘nutrition information 
is’’. 
The revisions read as follows: 
§ 381.445 Nutrition labeling of single- 
ingredient, raw poultry products that are 
not ground or chopped products described 
in § 381.401. 
(a)(1) Nutrition information on the 
major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
poultry products identified in § 381.444, 
including those that have been 
previously frozen, is required, either on 
their label or at their point-of-purchase, 
unless exempted under § 381.500. If 
nutrition information is presented on 
the label, it must be provided in 
accordance with the provisions of 
§ 381.409. If nutrition information is 
presented at the point-of-purchase, it 
must be provided in accordance with 
the provisions of this section. 
(2) Nutrition information on single- 
ingredient, raw poultry products that 
are not ground or chopped poultry 
products described in § 381.401 and are 
not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw 
poultry products identified in § 381.444, 
including those that have been 
previously frozen, may be provided at 
their point-of-purchase in accordance 
with the provisions of this section or on 
their label, in accordance with the 
provisions of § 381.409. 
(3) A retailer may provide nutrition 
information at the point-of-purchase by 
various methods, such as by posting a 
sign or by making the information 
readily available in brochures, 
notebooks, or leaflet form in close 
proximity to the food. The nutrition 
labeling information may also be 
supplemented by a video, live 
demonstration, or other media. If a 
nutrition claim is made on point-of- 
purchase materials, all of the format and 
content requirements of § 381.409 
apply. However, if only nutrition 
information—and not a nutrition 
claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase 
materials, the requirements of § 381.409 
apply, provided, however: 
(i) The listing of percent of Daily 
Value for the nutrients (except vitamins 
and minerals specified in 
§ 381.409(c)(8)) and footnote required by 
§ 381.409(d)(9) may be omitted; and 
(ii) The point-of-purchase materials 
are not subject to any of the format 
requirements.
