HIPAA Administrative Simplification: 
Modification to Medical Data Code Set 
Standards To Adopt ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS 
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: This proposed rule would 
modify two of the medical data code set 
standards adopted in the Transactions 
and Code Sets final rule published in 
the Federal Register. It would also 
implement certain provisions of the 
Administrative Simplification subtitle 
of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. 
Specifically, the proposed rule would 
modify the standard code sets for coding 
diagnoses and inpatient hospital 
procedures by concurrently adopting 
the International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD–10–CM) for diagnosis 
coding, and the International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
Revision, Procedure Coding System 
(ICD–10–PCS) for inpatient hospital 
procedure coding. These new codes 
would replace the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD–9– 
CM) Volumes 1 and 2, and the 
International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(CM) Volume 3 for diagnosis and 
procedure codes, respectively.

I. Background 
A. Statutory Background 
The Congress addressed the need for 
a consistent framework for electronic 
transactions and other administrative 
simplification issues in the Health 
Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), 
Public Law 104–191, enacted on August 
21, 1996. HIPAA has improved the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs and 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
health care system in general, by 
encouraging the development of 
standards and requirements to facilitate 
the electronic transmission of certain 
health information. 
Through subtitle F of title II of that 
statute, the Congress added to title XI of 
the Social Security Act (the Act) a new 
Part C, titled ‘‘Administrative 
Simplification.’’ Part C of title XI of the 
Act consists of sections 1171 through 
1179. Section 1172 of the Act and the 
implementing regulations make any 
standard adopted under Part C 
applicable to: (1) Health plans; (2) 
health care clearinghouses; and (3) 
health care providers who transmit any 
health information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a standard. 
Section 1172(c)(1) of the Act requires 
any standard adopted by the Secretary 
of the Department of Health and Human 
Services (the Secretary) to be developed, 
adopted, or modified by a standard 
setting organization (SSO), except in the 
special cases identified under section 
1172(c)(2) of the Act. Under section 
1172(c)(2)(A) of the Act, the Secretary 
may adopt a standard that is different 
from any standard developed by an SSO 
if it will substantially reduce 
administrative costs to health care 
providers and health plans compared to 
the alternatives, and the standard is 
promulgated in accordance with the 
rulemaking procedures of subchapter III 
of chapter 5 of Title 5 of the United 
States Code. Under section 1172(c)(2)(B) 
of the Act, if no SSO has developed, 
adopted, or modified any standard 
relating to a standard that the Secretary 
is authorized or required to adopt, 
section 1172(c)(1) does not apply. 
Section 1172 of the Act also sets forth 
consultation requirements that must be 
met before the Secretary may adopt 
standards. The SSO must consult with 
the following Data Content Committees 
(DCCs) in the course of the 
development, adoption, or modification 
of the standard: the National Uniform 
Billing Committee (NUBC), the National 
Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC), the 
Workgroup for Electronic Data 
Interchange (WEDI), and the American 
Dental Association (ADA). For a 
standard that was not developed by an 
SSO, the Secretary is required to consult 
with each of the above-named groups 
before adopting the standard. Under 
section 1172(f) of the Act, the Secretary 
must also rely on the recommendations 
of the National Committee on Vital and 
Health Statistics (NCVHS) and consult 
with appropriate Federal and State 
agencies and private organizations. 
Section 1173(a) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to adopt transaction standards 
and data elements for the electronic 
exchange of health information for 
certain health care transactions. Under 
sections 1173(b) through (f) of the Act, 
the Secretary is required to adopt 
standards for: unique health identifiers, 
code sets, security standards for health 
information, electronic signatures, and 
the transfer of information among health 
plans. 
Section 1174 of the Act permits the 
Secretary to review the adopted 
standards and adopt modifications as 
appropriate, but not more frequently 
than once every 12 months in a manner 
which minimizes disruption and cost of 
compliance. The same section requires 
the Secretary to ensure that procedures 
exist for the routine maintenance, 
testing, enhancement, and expansion of 
code sets, along with instructions on 
how data elements encoded before any 
modification may be converted or 
translated to preserve the information 
value of any pre-existing data elements. 
Section 1175(b) of the Act provides 
for a compliance date not later than 24 
months after the date on which an 
initial standard or implementation 
specification is adopted for all covered 
entities except small health plans, for 
which the statute provides for a 
compliance date not later than 36 
months after the date on which an 
initial standard or implementation 
specification is adopted. If the Secretary 
adopts a modification to a HIPAA 
standard or implementation 
specification, the compliance date for 
the modification may not be earlier than 
the 180th day following the effective 
date of the adoption of the modification. 
The Secretary may consider the nature 
and extent of the modification when 
determining compliance dates. The 
Secretary may extend the time for 
compliance for small health plans. We 
are proposing that the compliance date 
for the provisions of this proposed rule 
for all covered entities, including small 
health plans, would be October 1, 2011. 
Please refer to the Transactions and 
Code Sets final rule (65 FR 50312), 
published in the Federal Register on 
August 17, 2000, and the Privacy Rule 
(65 FR 82462), published in the Federal 
Register on December 28, 2000, for 
further information about electronic 
data interchange and the statutory 
background. 
B. Regulatory Background: Adoption 
and Modification of HIPAA Code Sets 
The Transactions and Code Sets final 
rule appeared in the August 17, 2000 
Federal Register (65 FR 50312). That 
rule implemented some of the 
requirements of the Administrative 
Simplification subtitle of HIPAA, by 
adopting standards for eight electronic 
transactions for use by covered entities 
(health plans, health care 
clearinghouses, and those health care 
providers who transmit any health 
information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a standard). 
We established these standards at 45 
CFR parts 160, subpart A, and 162, 
subparts A, and I through R. The 
Transactions and Code Sets 
Modifications final rule, published on 
February 20, 2003 (68 FR 8381), 
modified the implementation 
specifications for several adopted 
transactions standards, among other 
provisions. (Please refer to the HIPAA 
Transactions and Code Sets final rule 
and HIPAA Transactions and Code Sets

49798 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 164 / Friday, August 22, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Modifications final rule for detailed 
discussions of electronic data 
interchange and an analysis of the 
public comments received during the 
promulgation of both rules). 
In the Transactions and Code Sets 
final rule, we also adopted a number of 
standard medical data code sets for use 
in those transactions, including: 
• International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD–9–CM) Volumes 1 
and 2 (including the Official ICD–9–CM 
Guidelines for Coding and Reporting) as 
maintained and distributed by HHS, for 
coding diseases, injuries, impairments, 
other health problems and their 
manifestations, and causes of injury, 
disease, impairment, or other health 
problems. 
• ICD–9–CM Volume 3 (including the 
Official ICD–9–CM Guidelines for 
Coding and Reporting) as maintained 
and distributed by HHS, for the 
following procedures or other actions 
taken for diseases, injuries, and 
impairments on hospital inpatients 
reported by hospitals: prevention, 
diagnosis, treatment, and management. 
ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 and 2, and 3 
were already widely used in 
administrative transactions when we 
promulgated the Transactions and Code 
Sets rule. We decided that adopting 
these existing code sets would be less 
disruptive for covered entities than 
modified or new code sets. In the 
Transactions and Code Sets final rule 
(65 FR 50327), we discussed comments 
on using the ICD–10–CM and ICD–10– 
PCS code sets as future HIPAA standard 
medical data code sets. Some 
commenters praised the accuracy of the 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS code sets, 
others raised concerns about the 
differences between the ICD–9–CM and 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS code sets, 
including the increased level of detail in 
ICD–10–PCS. We responded that 
additional testing and revision were 
needed before adopting the ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS code sets as a 
standard. (Please refer to the 
Transactions and Code Sets final rule 
for details of that discussion (65 FR 
50327).) 
In addition to standard transactions 
and code sets, the final rule adopted a 
procedure for maintaining existing 
standards, for adopting modifications to 
existing standards, and for adopting 
new standards. Our process in 
proposing the adoption of ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS, to replace ICD–9–CM 
Volumes 1 and 2, and 3, follows that 
procedure. The following is a summary 
of the consultation requirements for the 
Secretary for the adoption of standards 
under sections 1172(b) through (f) of the 
Act: 
For standards that have been 
developed, adopted, or modified by a 
standard setting organization, the SSO 
must consult with the following 
organizations in the course of such 
development, adoption, or modification: 
• The National Uniform Billing 
Committee (NUBC). 
• The National Uniform Claim 
Committee (NUCC). 
• The Workgroup for Electronic Data 
Interchange (WEDI). 
• The American Dental Association 
(ADA). 
For any other standards, the Secretary 
is required to consult with these same 
organizations. 
As part of the HIPAA modification 
and update process, the NCVHS holds 
hearings on proposed changes to HIPAA 
transaction and code set standards and 
makes recommendations to the 
Secretary as appropriate. 
Under section 1174 of the Act, the 
Secretary must also ensure that 
procedures exist for the routine 
maintenance, testing, enhancement, and 
expansion of code sets, and provide 
instructions on how data elements 
encoded before any modification may be 
converted or translated. As discussed in 
section VIII.A of this proposed rule, we 
will establish an ICD–10–CM/PCS 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee that is similar to the ICD–9– 
CM Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee. The ICD–10–CM/PCS 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee will be charged with routine 
maintenance, testing, enhancement, and 
the expansion of the ICD–10 code sets. 
In addition, the National Center for 
Health Statistics (NCHS) has recently 
completed a crosswalk that maps ICD– 
9–CM Volumes 1 and 2 to ICD–10–CM. 
CMS also has developed a crosswalk 
that maps ICD–9–CM Volume 3 to ICD– 
10–PCS. These crosswalks are available 
at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ICD10 
(accessed 8–12–08) and http:// 
www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/otheract/icd9/ 
icd10cm.htm, (accessed 8–12–08). 
These crosswalks are revised in the fall 
of each year. 
II. ICD–9–CM 
The International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD) is developed and 
maintained by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). Originally 
designed to classify causes of death 
(mortality), the scope of the ICD has 
expanded to include non-fatal diseases 
(morbidity). The application of the 
classification to morbidity has expanded 
as the code set has been revised. 
Nonetheless, the United States and 
other countries continue to find it 
necessary to develop clinical 
modifications of the ICD to meet the 
needs of their respective health care 
systems that include administrative and 
clinical protocols, and require more 
detail and specificity for reporting 
health care. 
When the Medicare hospital Inpatient 
Prospective Payment System (IPPS) was 
implemented in 1983, ICD–9–CM was 
used as the basic input for assigning the 
diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). All 
diagnostic and procedural information 
was captured using ICD–9–CM. 
A. ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 and 2 
(Diagnoses) 
NCHS houses the WHO Collaborating 
Center for the Family of International 
Classifications for North America 
(United States and Canada), and has 
responsibility for the implementation of 
the ICD. NCHS produced a clinical 
modification to WHO’s ICD–9 by adding 
more specificity to its diagnosis codes 
(ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 and 2). ICD–9– 
CM maps to ICD to facilitate comparison 
of mortality and morbidity statistics. 
ICD–9–CM was adopted in the United 
States in 1979 for morbidity 
applications, and was adopted as a 
HIPAA standard in 2000 for reporting 
diagnoses, injuries, impairments, and 
other health problems and their 
manifestations, and causes of injury, 
disease, impairment or other health 
problems in standard transactions. ICD– 
9–CM diagnosis codes are three to five 
digits long, and are used by all types of 
health care providers, including 
hospitals and physician practices. The 
code set is organized into chapters by 
body system. 
B. ICD–9–CM Volume 3 (Procedures) 
Inpatient hospital services procedures 
are currently coded using ICD–9–CM 
Volume 3. The WHO’s ICD does not 
include procedure codes. ICD–9–CM 
procedure codes are three to four digits 
long. The code set was adopted as a 
HIPAA standard in 2000 for reporting 
inpatient hospital procedures. Current 
Procedural Terminology, 4th Edition 
(CPT–4) and Health Care Common 
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) are 
used to code all other procedures. The 
ICD–9–CM procedure code set is 
organized into chapters by body system, 
and CMS maintains the ICD–9–CM 
procedure codes. 
C. Maintaining/Updating ICD–9–CM 
(Volumes 1 and 2, and 3) 
Recognizing the need for ICD–9–CM 
to be a flexible, dynamic statistical tool 
to meet expanding classification needs, 
the ICD–9–CM Coordination and

49799 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 164 / Friday, August 22, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Maintenance Committee was created in 
1985 as a forum for receiving public 
comments on proposed code revisions, 
deletions, and additions. The 
Committee is co-chaired by the NCHS 
and CMS; NCHS maintains ICD–9–CM 
Diagnosis Codes (Volumes 1 and 2), and 
CMS maintains ICD–9–CM Procedure 
Codes (Volume 3). 
Although the ICD–9–CM Coordination 
and Maintenance Committee is a 
Federal committee, suggestions for 
updates come from both the public and 
private sectors. Interested parties may 
submit recommendations for updates 
(that is, adding new codes, deleting 
codes, and editing descriptive material 
related to existing codes) at least 2 
months before a scheduled meeting. 
Proposals for a new code must include 
a description of the code being 
requested and rationale for why the new 
code is needed. Supporting references 
and literature may also be submitted. 
This Federal committee meets in 
March and September. Decisions on 
code title revisions are made by March 
for inclusion in the annual IPPS 
proposed rule. Updates on codes, 
payments, and reporting systems are 
finalized after the previous fall meeting 
and may become effective October 1 of 
the same year. 
Section 503(a) of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. 
L. 108–173, enacted on December 8, 
2003) included a requirement for 
updating ICD–9–CM codes twice a year, 
instead of a single update on October 1 
of each year. Section 503(a) of the 
MMA, which amended section 
1886(d)(5)(K) of the Act, states that the 
‘‘Secretary shall provide for the addition 
of new diagnosis and procedure codes 
in April 1 of each year, but the addition 
of such codes shall not require the 
Secretary to adjust the payment (or 
diagnosis-related group classification) 
* * * until the fiscal year that begins 
after such date.’’ By adding codes for a 
new technology at an earlier date, CMS 
can recognize the new technology more 
quickly for purposes of payment under 
the IPPS. 
While section 503(a) of the MMA does 
not require the Secretary to adjust the 
DRG classification and payments until 
the subsequent fiscal year, the DRG 
software and other systems must be 
updated to recognize and accept the 
new codes, and providers must update 
their systems mid-year to capture the 
new codes. Hospitals must obtain 
coding book updates and coding 
software updates and make other system 
changes to capture and report the new 
codes. 
Proposals for new and revised codes, 
summaries of meetings, information 
about deadlines for comment, scheduled 
dates for the next meeting, deadlines for 
receipt of maintenance proposals, and 
mailing and e-mail addresses are posted 
to the CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes, accessed 
8–12–08, and the NCHS Web site http:// 
www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd9.htm, accessed 
8–12–08. Additionally, CMS and NCHS 
publish a complete addendum 
describing details of all changes to ICD– 
9–CM. It is publicized on their Web 
sites in May of each year. Many 
commenters on the proposed 
Transactions and Code Sets proposed 
rule commended this open process (65 
FR 50343–50344). 
III. Limitations of ICD–9–CM 
A. Background 
In 1997, the NCVHS began to study 
the issues related to known 
shortcomings of ICD–9–CM and to 
assess the need to transition to ICD–10 
(or an alternative code set), including 
the impact of such a transition. The 
NCVHS has conducted more than 8 days 
of hearings since 1997. Oral and written 
testimony was provided by more than 
80 public and private sector groups 
representing the health care industry, 
Federal and State governments, the 
public health and research 
communities, health plans, and health 
care providers. In addition, the NCVHS 
commissioned a RAND Corporation 
study on the potential costs and benefits 
of transitioning to ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10–PCS. From the testimony received 
and the RAND study findings, NCVHS 
concluded that ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10–PCS should be adopted as a HIPAA 
standard to replace the current standard, 
ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 and 2, and 3. In 
a letter to the Secretary dated November 
5, 2003, NCVHS recommended that 
HHS initiate the regulatory process for 
the concurrent adoption of ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS. The NCVHS letter 
(http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/ 
031105lt.htm) accessed 8–12–08, an 
overview of the development of ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS (http://

B. General 
The ICD–9–CM code set has been in 
use for over 27 years, and additional 
codes have been added during that 
period to describe new procedures and 
diagnoses that reflect changes in 
medical practice. The total number of 
codes (approximately 13,000 for 
diagnoses and 3,000 for procedures) is 
insufficient to continue to respond to 
the need for new codes. Moreover, the 
code set was never designed to provide 
the increased level of detail needed to 
support emerging needs, such as 
biosurveillance and pay-for- 
performance programs (P4P), also 
known as value-based purchasing or 
competitive purchasing. These 
limitations are discussed in detail below 
and have led to the current industry 
debate regarding replacement of ICD–9– 
CM. Industry experts have discussed 
and commented on these issues during 
testimony to the NCVHS, expressing 
their belief that the ICD–9–CM code set 
is nearing the end of its useful life. We 
invite public comment on concerns with 
continued use of the ICD–9–CM code 
set. 
1. Space Limitations 
The ICD–9–CM code set that we 
adopted in 2000 as a HIPAA standard 
had been evolving since 1979. Because 
of the new and changing medical 
advancements during the past 20 plus 
years, the functionality of the ICD–9– 
CM code set has been exhausted. This 
code set is no longer able to respond to 
additional classification specificity, 
newly identified disease entities, and 
other advances. Many chapters of ICD– 
9–CM are full, and the American 
Hospital Association (AHA) has 
estimated that we will run out of 
procedure codes in the appropriate, 
logical sections of ICD–9–CM as well as 
the overflow chapters in 2009. As a 
temporary solution, CMS has already 
begun to assign codes to the 
inappropriate sections of ICD–9–CM (for 
example, codes for heart procedures 
being placed in the eye chapter). We 
will continue to take this unusual step 
of making illogical code assignments in 
order to maintain the ability to capture 
emerging technologies. This illogical 
assignment of codes will lead to 
challenges for coders in identifying and 
assigning codes, but establishing new 
codes to identify new procedures 
remains important. The diagnosis- 
related group (DRG) system classifies 
hospital cases into groups that are 
expected to have similar hospital 
resource needs. DRGs are assigned

based on diagnoses, procedures, age, 
sex, and the presence of complications 
or co-morbidities. 
The technologies included in the 
DRGs are identified by ICD–9–CM 
procedure codes. ICD–10–PCS allows 
the use of DRG definitions that better 
define new technologies and devices, 
and that could be refined to take 
advantage of their additional specificity 
through more detailed descriptions. 
This critical lack of space for new 
procedures and conditions is one 
important consideration for proposing 
to adopt ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. 
In addition, ICD–9–CM’s space 
limitations are creating other problems, 
which are discussed below. 
2. Impact of Workarounds on Structural 
Hierarchy 
The hierarchical structure of the ICD– 
9–CM procedure code set is 
compromised. Some chapters can no 
longer accommodate new codes, with 
the result that any additional codes 
must be assigned to other topically 
unrelated chapters. For example, new 
hip replacement procedures must now 
be assigned to an ‘‘overflow’’ chapter for 
procedures that are not classified 
elsewhere. When those chapters become 
full, new procedures would have to be 
assigned to a chapter now devoted to 
procedures related to the eye. When a 
code is isolated in a separate, unrelated 
part of the ICD–9–CM book because 
there is no available space in the section 
where the code normally would be 
assigned, coders may not easily find the 
code. Researchers and statisticians also 
may miss cases in their analyses. 
3. Lack of Detail 
Industry experts have pointed out that 
in an age of electronic health records, it 
does not make sense to use a coding 
system that lacks specificity and does 
not lend itself well to updates. Another 
consideration about the limitations of 
ICD–9–CM is that to generate 
meaningful research results, researchers 
need to have access to comprehensive, 
rich data with a level of detail that does 
not exist with ICD–9–CM. Emerging 
health care technologies, new and 
advanced terminologies, and the need 
for interoperability amid the increase in 
electronic health records (EHRs) and 
personal health records (PHRs) require a 
standard code set that is expandable and 
sufficiently detailed to accurately 
capture current and future health care 
information. Coding that accurately 
describes diagnoses and procedures will 
capture information that is critical for 
research, and ultimately improves the 
quality of health care and cost 
containment by enabling the study of 
specific conditions and options for 
treating them. Accuracy also is a critical 
factor in the development of Pay for 
Performance (P4P) programs, because 
successful programs require detailed 
coding of diagnoses and the procedures 
performed to treat specific conditions. 
The details for advanced technology 
procedures currently being performed 
today were not available when ICD–9– 
CM was being developed. Numerous 
ICD–9–CM procedure codes are based 
upon technology that is now outdated. 
As we move toward more sophisticated 
monitoring and quality reporting, this 
level of detail when reporting diagnoses 
and procedures becomes critical. 
Examples are noted below: 
• ICD–9–CM has a single diagnosis 
code for fracture of the wrist. If a patient 
is treated for two successive wrist 
fractures, the ICD–9–CM code does not 
provide enough detail to determine if 
the second fracture is a repeat fracture 
of the same wrist, a fracture of the other 
wrist, incorrect billing for delayed 
healing, or non-union or mal-union of 
the original fracture. 
• ICD–9–CM contains a single 
procedure code that describes the 
endovascular repair or occlusion of 
head and neck vessels (39.72). It does 
not describe the artery or vein on which 
the repair is performed, the precise 
nature of the repair, or whether the 
approach is a percutaneous procedure 
or is transluminal with a catheter. 
• Four or more ICD–9–CM procedure 
codes are needed to delineate a spinal 
fusion procedure with sufficient detail 
to describe the level of the spine and the 
devices inserted. 
4. Mortality Reporting and 
Biosurveillance 
The ICD–9 diagnosis code set is no 
longer supported or maintained by the 
WHO. As of October 2002, 138 countries 
have adopted ICD–10 for coding and 
reporting mortality data, and 99 
countries have adopted ICD–10 or a 
clinical modification for coding and 
reporting morbidity data. In 1999, the 
United States adopted ICD–10, but only 
for mortality reporting. Until the United 
States implements ICD–10 for morbidity 
reporting applications, data 
incomparability will continue to 
increase throughout the world. 
As we become a global community, it 
is vital that our health care data 
represent current medical conditions 
and technologies, and that they are 
compatible with the international 
version of ICD–10. Because the United 
States is capturing morbidity data using 
the outdated ICD–9–CM, there are 
problems identifying new health threats 
such as anthrax, Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and 
Monkeypox. 
The lack of specificity in ICD–9–CM 
also limits our ability to develop rapid 
interventions for emerging diseases 
affecting international populations. 
Diagnosis and procedure information 
are captured from administrative data 
that are submitted on health care claims, 
and admission and discharge 
summaries, but if the codes do not 
match the international standard and 
are unable to be compared, their 
significance is lost. Additionally, 
hospitals utilize diagnosis and 
procedure codes for utilization review, 
disease management, and research. 
Therefore, in addition to the need for 
precise diagnosis and procedure codes 
for payment purposes, detail and 
precision in coding are critical to the 
national and international health care 
community for mortality reporting, 
biosurveillance, treatment of patients, 
hospital management, and research. 
IV. ICD–10 and the Development of 
ICD–10–CM and PCS 
A. Overview 
The WHO developed ICD–10 in 1989, 
and it was adopted by the World Health 
Assembly in 1990. Currently, the United 
States is the only G7 nation (the other 
G7 nations are Canada, France, 
Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Japan) 
continuing to use ICD–9 for morbidity 
reporting. Furthermore, Great Britain, 
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, 
Sweden, France, Australia, Belgium, 
Germany, and Canada use a clinical 
modification of ICD–10 for 
reimbursement and/or administrative 
purposes. 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS provide 
specific diagnosis and treatment 
information that can improve quality 
measurements and patient safety, and 
the evaluation of medical processes and 
outcomes. ICD–10–PCS has the 
capability to readily expand and capture 
new procedures and technologies. 
For quality improvement programs to 
effectively result in meaningful clinical 
outcomes, improved practice 
management processes that document 
and measure patient care, and sustain 
provider investment in services that 
improve quality of care, the ability to 
modify or add to a list of treatments, 
diseases and conditions is essential. The 
ICD–10 code sets provide a standard 
coding convention that is flexible, 
providing unique codes for all 
substantially different procedures or 
health conditions and allowing new 
procedures and diagnoses to be easily 
incorporated as new codes for both 
existing and future clinical protocols.

B. ICD–10–CM Diagnosis Codes 
The NCHS has developed a clinical 
modification of the WHO’s ICD–10 
called ICD–10–CM for reporting 
diagnosis codes. As in the relationship 
between ICD–9 and ICD–9–CM Volumes 
1 and 2, ICD–10–CM codes can be 
mapped back to the ICD–10 codes. The 
NCHS has worked closely with specialty 
societies to ensure clinical utility and 
input into the process of creating the 
clinical modification, with comments 
from a number of prominent specialty 
groups and organizations that addressed 
specific concerns or perceived unmet 
clinical needs encountered with ICD–9– 
CM. The NCHS also had discussions 
with other users of the classification, 
specifically nursing, rehabilitation, 
primary care providers, the National 
Committee for Quality Assurance 
(NCQA), long-term care and home 
health care providers, and managed care 
organizations to solicit their comments 
about the classification. 
ICD–10–CM diagnosis codes are three 
to seven alphanumeric characters; the 
number of ICD–10–CM codes is 
approximately 68,000. The ICD–10–CM 
code set provides much more 
information and detail within the codes 
than ICD–9–CM, facilitating timely 
electronic processing of claims by 
reducing requests for additional 
information. 
ICD–10–CM also includes the 
following improvements over ICD–9– 
CM: 
• Significant improvements in coding 
primary care encounters, external 
causes of injury, mental disorders, 
neoplasms, and preventive health. 
• Advances in medicine and medical 
technology that have occurred since the 
last revision. 
• Codes with more detail on 
socioeconomic, family relationships, 
ambulatory care conditions, problems 
related to lifestyle, and the results of 
screening tests. 
• More space to accommodate future 
expansions (alphanumeric structure). 
• New categories for post-procedural 
disorders. 
• The addition of laterality— 
specifying which organ or part of the 
body is involved when the location 
could be on the right, the left, or could 
be bilateral. 
• Expanded distinctions for 
ambulatory and managed care 
encounters. 
ICD–10–CM codes with the same first 
three digits have common traits, and 
each additional digit adds more 
specificity. For example: 
I49. Other cardiac arrhythmias 
I49.0 Ventricular fibrillation and 
flutter 
I49.01 Ventricular fibrillation 
I49.02 Ventricular flutter 
Post-procedural disorders specific to a 
particular body system are located in 
categories created at the end of each 
chapter. Diseases are arranged according 
to an axis of classification based on 
etiology, anatomy, or severity, with 
anatomy being the primary axis for ICD– 
10–CM. (See section V of this proposed 
rule for a chart that compares ICD–9– 
CM, ICD–10–CM, and ICD–10–PCS 
codes). 
C. ICD–10–PCS Procedure Codes 
CMS developed a procedure coding 
system, ICD–10–PCS. ICD–10–PCS has 
no relationship to the basic ICD–10 
diagnostic classification, which does not 
include procedures, and has a totally 
different structure from ICD–10–CM. 
ICD–10–PCS is sufficiently detailed to 
describe complex medical procedures. 
This becomes increasingly important 
when assessing and tracking the quality 
of medical processes and outcomes, and 
compiling statistics that are valuable 
tools for research. ICD–10–PCS has 
unique, precise codes to differentiate 
body parts, surgical approaches, and 
devices used. It can be used to identify 
resource consumption differences and 
outcomes for different procedures, and 
describes precisely what is done to the 
patient. 
ICD–10–PCS codes have seven 
alphanumeric characters and group 
together services into approximately 30 
procedures identified by a leading alpha 
character. There are 16 sections of tables 
that determine code selection, with each 
character having a specific meaning. 
The first character shows the type of 
procedure by clinical specialty. Nearly 
half of these 16 sections remain 
undesignated at this time, leaving room 
for future expansion. Each subsequent 
place in the code has a specific 
function, the meaning of which may 
change depending on the section. For 
example, the fifth character in the 
imaging section identifies the contrast 
material used, while the fifth character 
in the medical and surgical section 
identifies the surgical approach. The 
second character defines the body 
system with the exception of the 
rehabilitation and mental health 
sections, in which the second character 
defines the type of procedure 
performed. 
Example: the Medical and Surgical 
Section is organized as follows: 
CHARACTERS 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
Name of Section Body System Root Operation Body Part Approach Device Qualifier 
D. Statutory Requirements for Adoption 
of ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
Under sections 1172(b), (c), (f), and (g) 
of the Act, the Secretary must follow 
certain procedures and pursue certain 
objectives when adopting a modification 
to an initial standard. Under section 
1172(b) of the Act, any standard 
adopted by the Secretary must be 
consistent with the objective of reducing 
the administrative costs of providing 
and paying for health care. As discussed 
in detail in section XI of this proposed 
rule, we believe that the costs for 
implementing ICD–10–CM and ICD–10– 
PCS would be offset by the benefits 
within four years of implementation. 
Under section 1172(c)(1) of the Act, 
any standard adopted by the Secretary 
must be a standard that has been 
developed, adopted or modified by a 
standard setting organization (SSO). 
Under section 1172(c)(2)(B) of the Act, 
however, section 1172(c)(1) does not 
apply if no SSO has developed, 
adopted, or modified any standard 
relating to a standard that the Secretary 
is authorized or required to adopt under 
HIPAA. To our knowledge, no SSO has 
developed, adopted, or modified a 
standard code set that is suitable for 
reporting medical diagnoses and 
hospital inpatient procedures for 
purposes of administrative transactions. 
Therefore, we are proposing to adopt 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS under 
section 1172(c)(2)(B) of the Act. 
We note that the SNOMED Clinical 
Terms (CT) code set may initially 
appear to be a standard developed by an 
SSO for reporting medical diagnoses 
and hospital inpatient procedures for 
purposes of administrative transactions. 
The College of American Pathologists 
(CAP), which developed SNOMED CT, 
is accredited by the American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) as an 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 18:09 Aug 21, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\22AUP3.SGM 22AUP3rw

accredited standards developer. The 
scope of the CAP’s accreditation, 
however, is limited. The CAP is 
accredited for activity relating to 
clinical terminology that focuses on 
standardizing that terminology across 
the breadth of medicine. Consistent 
with this scope of focus, SNOMED CT, 
which is now supported by the 
International Health Terminology 
Standards Development Organization 
(http://www.ihtsdo.org), is clinical 
terminology that is primarily designed 
for primary documentation of clinical 
care. SNOMED CT is not designed for 
carrying out health care transactions. In 
fact, part of the CAP’s scope of ANSI 
accreditation is deriving mapping 
strategies from clinical reference 
terminology and medical classification 
schemes and codes sets used for 
statistical, billing, or user interface 
purposes. Thus, in order to be useful for 
health care transactions, the SNOMED 
CT code set would first have to be 
mapped to a classification coding 
system, such as ICD–10–CM. (For 
further discussion of SNOMED CT and 
its potential value to the development of 
electronic health records (EHRs), please 
refer to section VI of this proposed rule.) 
For these reasons, we do not believe that 
SNOMED CT qualifies under section 
1172(c)(1) of the Act as a standard 
developed by an SSO for reporting 
medical diagnoses and hospital 
inpatient procedures for purposes of 
administrative transactions. 
Under section 1172(c)(3) of the Act, 
the Secretary must consult with the 
following organizations before adopting 
a standard that was not developed, 
adopted, or modified by an SSO: 
• The National Uniform Billing 
Committee (NUBC). 
• The National Uniform Claim 
Committee (NUCC). 
• The Workgroup for Electronic Data 
Interchange (WEDI). 
• The American Dental Association 
(ADA). 
These organizations are members of 
the Designated Standard Maintenance 
Organization (DSMO) Steering 
Committee. The DSMO Steering 
Committee considered a January 8, 2003 
DSMO Change Request submitted by the 
Centers for Disease Control seeking 
modification to the transaction code set 
to accommodate ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10–PCS. The DSMO Steering Committee 
approved the change request and 
recommended the adoption of 
implementation specifications that 
would support the implementation of 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS to the 
NCVHS. 
Furthermore, CMS also consulted 
with WEDI regarding ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS after two industry-focused 
informational forums they conducted on 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS during 
2006. In a letter to the Secretary dated 
May 31, 2006, WEDI outlined 
discussions that occurred during an 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS forum on 
April 19th and 20th 2006 in Chicago 
that was co-chaired by representatives 
of the American Hospital Association, 
and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of 
South Carolina. The purpose of the 
forum was to solicit audience 
discussion and input on various 
implementation issues surrounding the 
possible adoption of the ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS code sets. The forum 
was not intended to debate the issue of 
whether these code sets should be 
adopted, but rather what would need to 
occur if they were adopted. CMS will 
further consult directly with NUBC, 
NUCC, and the ADA before adopting 
any ICD–10 code set as a modification. 
Under section 1172(f) of the Act, the 
Secretary must rely on the 
recommendations of the NCVHS 
established under section 306(k) of the 
Public Health Service Act and must 
consult with appropriate Federal and 
State agencies and private organizations. 
The Secretary must publish 
notification in the Federal Register of 
any recommendation of the NCVHS. 
The NCVHS has conducted 8 days of 
hearings with providers, health plans, 
clearinghouses, vendors, and interested 
stakeholders on the adoption of ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS in place of 
ICD–9–CM as the HIPAA adopted 
standard for reporting diagnoses and 
hospital inpatient services in standard 
transactions. (A list of organizations that 
provided comments to the NCVHS is 
available at http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/ 
031105a3.htm, accessed 8–12–08.) In a 
letter dated November 5, 2003, the 
NCVHS submitted to the Secretary its 
recommendation to adopt ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS. This letter is available 
at http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/ 
031105lt.htm, accessed 8–12–08. The 
Secretary also has considered input 
from Federal and State agencies and 
private organizations regarding the 
adoption and implementation of ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS, and has 
received input from a number of 
professional organizations and other 
industry stakeholders. The following 
organizations representing providers, 
health plans, clearinghouses, and 
vendors are among the stakeholders that 
have provided input: 
• The American Health Information 
Management Association (AHIMA). 
• The American Medical Association 
(AMA). 
• The Blue Cross Blue Shield 
Association (BCBSA). 
• The Medical Group Management 
Association (MGMA). 
• Health Information and 
Management Systems Society (HIMSS). 
• America’s Health Insurance Plans 
(AHIP).

Both ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
provide laterality, precise anatomical 
descriptions, methods to report the 
exact causes of injury in diagnosing 
conditions, and approaches used to 
perform specific procedures. Laterality 
refers to the precision with which ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS describe 
conditions and treatments for the 
anatomical right and left side.

VI. Discussion of SNOMED CT 
SNOMED Clinical Terms (CT) is a 
comprehensive clinical terminology that 
provides a framework to manage 
language dialects, clinically relevant 
subsets, qualifiers and extensions, as 
well as concepts and terms that are 
unique to particular organizations or 
localities. It contains over 366,170 
concepts with unique meanings and 
formal logic-based definitions that are 
organized into hierarchies. Some 
examples of these hierarchies are: 
• Staging and scales—contains 
concepts naming assessment scales and 
tumor staging systems. 
• Social context—contains social 
conditions and circumstances 
significant to health care. 
• Observable entity—concepts 
represent a question or procedure 
which, when combined with a result, 
constitute a finding. 
In order to express these clinical 
concepts, SNOMED CT contains more 
than 993,420 English language 
descriptions, and approximately 1.46 
million semantic relationships. It would 
be impractical to attempt to manually 
assign SNOMED–CT codes. The 
number of terms and level of detail in 
a reference of clinical terminology such 
as SNOMED CT cannot be effectively 
managed without automation, and are 
not suited for the secondary purposes 
for which classifications systems such 
as ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS are 
used because of their immense size, 
considerable granularity, complex 
hierarchies, and lack of reporting rules.1 
SNOMED CT is a clinical 
terminology that is described as an 
input system that is primarily designed 
for the primary documentation of 
clinical care. A clinical terminology 
intended to support clinical care 
processes should not be manipulated to 
meet reimbursement and other external 
reporting requirements. Such 
manipulation presents the potential to 
adversely affect patient care, the 
development and use of decision 
support tools, and the practice of 
evidence-based medicine. 
ICD–9–CM, ICD–10–CM, and ICD–10– 
PCS are classification coding 
conventions that are typically used for 
reporting requirements where data 
aggregation is advantageous. A 
classification system such as ICD 
arranges like entities for retrieval. It 
aggregates granular clinical concepts 
into categories for secondary data 
purposes. Examples of current use of 
this data include: 
• Designing health care delivery 
systems. 
• Setting health policy. 
• Tracking public health and risks. 
• Monitoring resource utilization. 
• Processing claims for 
reimbursement. 
The benefits of using SNOMED CT 
increase if it is linked to a classification 
system such as ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10–PCS for the purpose of generating 
health information that is necessary for 
statistical analysis and reimbursement. 
The use of both SNOMED–CT and 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS brings 
value to the development of 
interoperable electronic health records 
(EHR). The linkage of these two 
different coding systems for multiple 
purposes is accomplished through 
mapping. 
‘‘Mapping is the process of linking 
content from one terminology to another 
or to a classification.’’ (http:// 
library.ahima.org), accessed 8–12–08. It 
requires deciding how different 
terminologies match, are similar, or 
differ. Mapping provides a link between 
terminologies to facilitate— 
• Use of data collected; 
• Retaining the value of data when 
migrating to newer databases; and 
• Avoiding entering data multiple 
times, and the risk of increased costs 
and errors. 
Using SNOMED CT mapped to ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS permits the 
use of a clinical terminology that could 
be the basis for EHRs and the ICD–10– 
CM and ICD–10–PCS classification 
coding system that is used for reporting 
and data trend analysis. 
As discussed in section IV of this 
proposed rule, we did not consider 
adopting SNOMED CT as an 
alternative for ICD–10–CM and ICD–10– 
PCS because the code sets are designed 
for distinctly different purposes. We do 
not believe that SNOMED CT qualifies 
under section 1172(c)(1) of the Act as a 
standard for reporting medical 
diagnoses and hospital inpatient 
procedures for purposes of 
administrative transactions. For similar 
reasons, we do not believe that we are 
required under the National Technology 
Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 
(NTTAA), Public Law 104–113, to 
consider adopting SNOMED CT. The 
NTTAA and Office of Management and

49804 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 164 / Friday, August 22, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Budget (OMB) Circular No. A–119, 
which provides some historical 
background and interpretation of parts 
of the NTTAA, directs Federal agencies 
to use voluntary consensus standards in 
lieu of government-unique standards, 
except where inconsistent with law or 
otherwise impractical. Because we do 
not believe that SNOMED CT is a 
suitable standard for reporting medical 
diagnoses and hospital inpatient 
procedures for purposes of 
administrative transactions, we believe 
that neither the NTTAA nor OMB 
Circular A–119 requires that we 
consider it for adoption. 
VII. Alternatives To Adopting ICD–10 
Code Sets 
In deciding to propose adoption of 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS, we 
considered a number of alternatives. We 
invite public comment on the following 
discussion of those alternatives and our 
rationale: 
A. Utilize Unassigned Codes 
It would be possible to extend the life 
of ICD–9–CM by assigning codes to new 
diagnoses and procedures without 
regard to the hierarchy of the code set. 
This hierarchy groups procedures by 
body systems, and then groups similar 
procedures that apply to a specific body 
system into categories. For example, 
ICD–9–CM Volume 3 was examined to 
identify any open series of codes that 
could be used for new procedures and 
technologies. Codes 17.00–17.99 
(located between Chapter 3: Operations 
on the Eye, and Chapter 4: Operations 
on the Ear) were not being used. This 
series of 100 codes could be used for a 
wide range of new procedures and 
technologies, adding additional space 
for expansion within the existing 
structure of the ICD–9–CM procedure 
volume. Additionally, codes 00.00— 
00.99 were not in use. The ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee decided to create a chapter 
in this unused location. This decision 
enabled the creation of 100 new codes 
to identify procedures that could not be 
assigned a code within the existing, and 
more appropriate, chapters because of 
space limitations. CMS departed from 
the current organizational structure of 
ICD–9–CM procedures when we created 
a variety of procedure codes in a new 
chapter 00, Procedures and 
Interventions NEC (NEC means Not 
Elsewhere Classified). CMS has created 
new codes in all 10 categories within 
chapter 00. Details on CMS coding 
changes are available on the CMS Web 
site at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes, accessed 
8–12–08. 
While this approach of placing codes 
in a non-hierarchically-created structure 
does extend the ability to assign ICD–9– 
CM codes to new diagnoses and 
procedures, it does not represent a long- 
term solution to the code shortage. It 
will only be an effective solution as long 
as there are empty code slots. Moreover, 
it does not address the remaining 
shortcomings of ICD–9–CM discussed 
above, such as the critical lack of detail 
that is required to support evolving 
business needs, for example, in the 
areas of biosurveillance and quality 
monitoring. While there have been 
space issues in ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 
and 2, they have not been as pressing as 
the space needs in ICD–9–CM Volume 
3. New categories/codes have been 
added within the chapters (body 
systems) of the classification, but not 
necessarily within the appropriate 
section within the chapter. New 
concepts have been incorporated into 
the existing structure, and in some 
instances this has meant not fully 
representing the concept as proposed 
because of space limitations. Some 
issues have been deferred and 
incorporated into ICD–10–CM because 
the concepts were inconsistent with the 
existing structure of ICD–9–CM. Unlike 
the procedures in ICD–9–CM Volume 3, 
which is a United States-developed 
system, the ICD–9–CM diagnosis codes 
are based on the WHO codes and must 
be consistent with the established 
structure. 
The disadvantage of this solution is 
that it destroys the natural hierarchy 
inherent in the code set. This hierarchy 
assists a coder or health care 
professional in choosing the most 
appropriate code since one can quickly 
review closely-related codes. Common 
coding practices do not require searches 
for unrelated procedures in a separate 
part of the coding book. However, these 
new chapters capture a very diverse 
group of unrelated procedures that 
affect a variety of body systems and are 
not logically placed in the chapters to 
which they relate. This creates 
considerable confusion for coders and 
difficulty locating the new codes, 
raising the likelihood of coding errors 
and negatively affecting productivity. 
B. Use CPT–4 for Coding Hospital 
Inpatient Procedures 
The American Medical Association 
(AMA) developed and maintains the 
Physicians’ Current Procedural 
Terminology (CPT) coding system to 
capture physician services. CPT also has 
been used to capture services performed 
in outpatient and ambulatory care 
settings, and is the HIPAA-adopted 
standard code set for reporting 
physician and certain other health care 
services. While evaluating the need to 
replace ICD–9–CM, the AMA 
recommended that CPT be used for 
coding inpatient services. A letter from 
the AMA’s medical organizations 
supporting the use of CPT for inpatient 
coding was sent to the Secretary on 
September 23, 2002. A copy of this 
letter is included in the Summary 
Report of the ICD–9–CM Volume 3 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee, December 6, 2002 meeting 
at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes (accessed 
8–12–08). The AMA was concerned 
about industry suggestions that a 
uniform procedure coding system be 
identified for use in all health care 
settings. If this were to be the case, the 
AMA wanted CPT to be considered as 
that uniform procedure coding system. 
The NCVHS had previously evaluated 
ICD–9–CM Volume 3 and CPT as 
potential coding systems that could be 
used to capture services in all health 
care settings. After extensive hearings 
and discussions, the NCVHS issued a 
‘‘Report of the National Committee on 
Vital and Health Statistics Concerning 
Issues Relating to the Coding and 
Classification Systems’’ in November 
1990. It found structural problems and 
serious flaws with both CPT–4 and ICD– 
9–CM Volume 3. During 1993, an 
NCVHS subcommittee held three 
meetings and three working sessions 
which addressed the creation of a single 
procedure classification system for 
multiple purposes in the United States. 
It was felt that neither system could 
capture services in all health care 
settings. Despite continuing NCVHS 
hearings, there has been no 
endorsement of the use of CPT for 
hospital inpatient procedure coding. 
The Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) undertook a study on the 
use of multiple procedure coding 
systems, issuing a final report in August 
2002 entitled, ‘‘HIPAA Standards, Dual 
Code Sets Are Acceptable for Reporting 
Medical Procedures’’ (GAO–02–796). 
The report concluded that ICD–9–CM 
Volume 3 and CPT do not meet all of 
the criteria for standard code sets under 
HIPAA and the procedural code set 
requirements recommended by NCVHS, 
including the criteria for adequate levels 
of detail for data analysis, and a 
capacity to add new codes in response 
to new technology. GAO sought advice 
from industry experts such as the 
American Hospital Association (AHA) 
and the American Health Information 
Management Association (AHIMA) as to 
whether CPT could be used for inpatient 
coding. AHA and AHIMA reported that 
CPT ‘‘does not adequately capture

facility-based, non-physician services.’’ 
The GAO report states that CPT has not 
been shown to be acceptable or 
comprehensive enough to serve as a 
single procedure code set for reporting 
both hospital inpatient and outpatient 
physician services. Therefore, GAO did 
not recommend the use of CPT–4 to 
capture inpatient services. Additional 
criticisms of CPT are that it does not 
include laterality, it has no predictable 
syntax, and the detail provided is 
inconsistent across procedures. 
The AHA, Federation of American 
Hospitals, and AdvaMED wrote a letter 
to the NCHVS on November 19, 2002 
regarding the implementation of ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. The letter 
endorsed the implementation of ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS as a national 
standard, and opposed the use of CPT 
for hospital inpatient services because it 
was designed for services more 
commonly provided in physicians’ 
offices, not services provided in a 
hospital inpatient setting. 
C. Wait and Adopt ICD–11 
One possible option is to forego 
adoption of ICD–10 and wait until ICD– 
11 is ready for implementation. The 
WHO, the developer of the ICD 
classification, has begun preliminary 
work on ICD–11. However, no firm 
timeframes for the completion of 
developmental work or testing have 
been identified, and no firm 
implementation date has been 
designated. Work has not yet begun on 
developing the companion procedure 
codes needed to implement ICD–11 in 
the United States. This means that the 
earliest projected date for 
implementation would be 2020, 
assuming that no clinical modification 
is needed for the ICD–11 and that the 
companion procedure code set could be 
completed in time. We project that we 
could not implement ICD–11 until 2016 
because it is still in development, 
testing would be required, and there are 
no firm timeframes for completion of 
developmental work. 
In addition, ICD–11 will follow the 
same alphanumeric structure as ICD–10, 
which differs from that of ICD–9. Since 
ICD–11 would build upon ICD–10, 
many of the costs and much of the work 
associated with upgrading to ICD–11 
will be mitigated by ICD–10 
implementation. This option of waiting 
for ICD–11 was eliminated because 
there are no confirmed dates for ICD–11 
readiness or adoption, ICD–11 will not 
include a procedure classification 
system and without ICD–10 to build 
upon, use of ICD–11 is likely to take 
longer to implement. ICD–9–CM would 
still have to be used in the interim, and 
ICD–9–CM is not the pathway to ICD– 
11 because it has a different structure 
than both ICD–10 and the anticipated 
ICD–11. 
VIII. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulation 
A. Use of ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
by Covered Entities 
In this proposed rule, we propose to 
adopt the ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
code sets to replace the ICD–9–CM 
Volumes 1 and 2 code sets for reporting 
diagnoses and Volume 3 code set for 
reporting procedures when conducting 
standard transactions. We would revise 
§ 162.1002(b) and § 162.1002(c), and 
adopt ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS in 
place of ICD–9–CM, Volumes 1 and 2, 
and 3. We would adopt ICD–10–CM to 
replace ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 and 2, 
including the official coding guidelines, 
for coding diseases, injuries, 
impairments, other health problems and 
their manifestations, and causes of 
injury, disease, impairment, or other 
health problems. Additionally, we 
would adopt ICD–10–PCS to replace 
ICD–9–CM Volume 3, including the 
official coding guidelines, for the 
following procedures or other actions 
taken for diseases, injuries, and 
impairments on hospital inpatients 
reported by hospitals: prevention, 
diagnosis, treatment, and management. 
HIPAA covered entities would be 
required to use these codes when 
diagnoses and hospital inpatient 
procedures need to be coded in HIPAA 
transactions. Because ICD–10–PCS 
codes are only used for inpatient 
hospital procedures, the ICD–10–PCS 
codes would not be used in outpatient 
transactions. 
In arriving at this proposal, we 
considered myriad input from the 
public, NCVHS, professional 
organizations, and others. Our 
deliberations centered around two sets 
of issues: the limitations of ICD–9–CM 
(Volumes 1 and 2, and 3), as discussed 
above, and the adoption of alternatives 
to ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS code 
sets. 
We will establish an ICD–10–CM/PCS 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee. This committee will follow 
the same procedures currently used by 
the ICD–9–CM Coordination and 
Maintenance Committee to consider 
new codes and revisions to existing 
codes. 
We acknowledge that this proposed 
rule does not specifically address 
impacts on prospective payment 
systems that currently use ICD–9–CM 
codes. We determined that these issues 
can best be addressed through the usual 
IPPS and other proposed rules that 
impact payment decisions and 
applications. 
B. Effective Dates 
The effective date of revised 
§ 162.1002 would be 60 days after a 
final rule is published in the Federal 
Register. 
C. Proposed Compliance Dates 
Under section 1175 of the Act, the 
compliance date of a modification to a 
HIPAA standard may not be earlier than 
the 180th day following the effective 
date of the adoption of the modification. 
The Secretary may consider the nature 
and extent of the modification when 
determining the compliance date. If the 
Secretary determines an extension is 
appropriate for small health plans, he 
may extend the time for their 
compliance. NCVHS testimony and 
subsequent industry input clearly 
indicate that the implementation of 
ICD–10 will be a significant 
undertaking. The activities involved in 
this implementation are discussed in 
detail in the impact analysis section of 
this proposed rule. 
Many covered entities have stated that 
they will need at least 2 years from the 
publication of a final rule to implement 
ICD–10. Some have argued that 3 years 
will be needed, noting that the original 
2-year implementation period for the 
initial HIPAA transaction standards 
proved to be insufficient. Others note 
that ICD–10 implementation should be 
viewed in the context of other HIPAA 
requirements (including the 
implementation of the National Provider 
Identifier and the claims attachment 
transaction standard) and other 
information technology initiatives, 
including IT initiatives integral to the 
Department’s transparency activities, 
and that ICD–10 compliance should not 
be required until 2012 or later. 
Coordination with these other health 
information technology (HIT) initiatives 
is discussed in the impact analysis of 
this proposed rule. 
HHS and industry health information 
technology initiatives include 
interoperability specifications, 
certification criteria, and standards 
developed under HIPAA and the 
Medicare Modernization Act. We 
describe these initiatives and associated 
known or projected publication, 
delivery, or compliance dates below: 
• Beginning in September 2006 (and 
annually thereafter)—Delivery of

(NPI) in all HIPAA transactions. 
• April 2009—Projected compliance 
date for new e-prescribing standards for 
the Medicare drug program, and use of 
NPI in e-prescribing transactions, 
pursuant to the Medicare Modernization 
Act. Medicare Part D Sponsors are 
required to support the standards. 
Prescribing providers and pharmacies 
are required to use them only if they 
choose to engage in e-prescribing. 
• 2010—Projected compliance date 
for the updated retail pharmacy drug 
claim, which will facilitate processing 
of Medicare drug claims and affects all 
pharmacies and plans that process 
pharmacy claims. 
• 2010—Projected compliance date 
for updated non-pharmacy HIPAA 
financial and administrative 
transactions which affects all HIPAA- 
covered entities. These transactions 
include the claim, remittance advice, 
eligibility, and claim status query and 
response transaction, plan enrollment, 
and referral authorization. Version 
4010/4010A1 of the American 
Standards Committee X12 group is the 
currently adopted standard. Version 
4010/4010A1 transactions cannot 
accommodate the larger size of ICD–10 
code set; therefore, the new version, 
5010, must be implemented in order to 
implement ICD–10 code sets. Industry 
representatives have recommended that 
the compliance date for these standards 
be at least 18 months before the 
compliance date for ICD–10 to allow for 
needed testing and to reduce risk. CMS 
is currently working on regulatory 
action regarding the transition to 5010 
in order to accommodate the ICD–10 
code set. 
• 2011—Projected compliance date 
for the new HIPAA standard for the 
claims attachment transaction, which 
would affect all HIPAA-covered entities 
that are not health plans. This standard 
addresses the communication of 
additional information, often of a 
clinical nature, that may be needed in 
order to adjudicate a claim. 
• 2012—Projected compliance date 
for small health plans conducting 
HIPAA claims attachment transactions. 
We acknowledge that implementing 
ICD–10 code sets will require significant 
effort on the part of covered entities and 
their vendors. We also recognize the 
need to transition to a new code set 
before ICD–9–CM becomes unworkable. 
Moreover, the enhanced functionality 
that ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS code 
sets bring to quality assessment, 
research, and biosurveillance argue for 
an earlier implementation. We have 
weighed all these factors in arriving at 
our proposal. 
We propose October 1, 2011 as the 
compliance date for ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS code sets for all covered 
entities. It is important to note that the 
compliance date must occur on October 
1 in order to coincide with the effective 
date of annual Medicare inpatient PPS 
updates. We believe that a 2011 
compliance date permits adequate time 
for covered entities and their vendors to 
complete the necessary implementation 
activities. As shown above, our 
projected compliance dates for other 
health IT initiatives have been 
sequenced in a manner that will allow 
covered entities to concentrate their 
efforts on ICD–10 implementation 
(including the implementation of the 
5010 transactions) during the relevant 
period. 
CMS believes it is in the industry’s 
best interest (including small health 
plans) to have a single compliance date 
for ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. This 
will reduce burden on both providers 
and insurers who will be able to edit on 
a single new coding system for claims 
received for encounters and discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 2011. 
The proposed compliance date, we 
believe, is also sufficiently far in the 
future to provide all sectors of the 
industry, including small health plans, 
adequate time to implement the code 
sets. A single compliance date also will 
significantly reduce confusion in 
processing claims and analyzing data. 
Historically, all previous versions of the 
ICD coding systems, such as ICD–7 and 
ICD–8, have been implemented on a 
single date. The health care industry has 
come to expect this consistent approach 
to updating ICD coding systems. To 
allow two different compliance dates 
would create problems for all sectors of 
the health care industry. Examples of 
problems that would arise if both ICD– 
9–CM and ICD–10 codes were allowed 
to be reported for the same date of 
service include: 
• Increased errors—ICD–9–CM and 
ICD–10–CM have codes that can include 
the same number of digits and similar 
codes. Allowing both code systems to be 
used and reported will create confusion 
in processing and interpreting coded 
data. Claims may be denied for services 
if the edits are established for ICD–10– 
CM codes, but ICD–9–CM codes are 
reported. Claims may be returned as 
errors if edits indicate there are too 
many or too few digits, when in fact a 
different coding system is being used. 
• Provider burden—Maintaining both 
ICD–9–CM and ICD–10–CM will place a 
significant burden on providers. 
Providers would have to maintain both 
coding systems for a year because of 
different reporting requirements by 
some payers or entities if there were two 
implementation dates. This will not 
only increase burden, but would also 
lead to additional error messages and 
returned claims if the provider does not 
select the required coding system when 
claims are coded. Coders would be 
burdened by having to recall and apply 
codes from different coding systems for 
a year. It is much easier to simply learn 
and move to the new coding system for 
encounters occurring on a single fixed 
date. 
• Systems problems—if providers, 
insurers, and other entities are required 
to report and accept both coding 
systems for encounters occurring during 
a year, there would be significant 
system implications in trying to 
determine which coding system was 
being used to report the coded data. As 
indicated above, this may lead to denied 
and returned claims. 
• Payment update challenges—coded 
data are used to update payment 
systems such as the inpatient 
prospective payment system. If codes 
are reported in both ICD–9–CM and 
ICD–10–CM during a given year, it will 
be difficult to assess the need to update 
and refine the payment system based on 
coded data. 
• Problems with national health care 
data—by allowing the use and reporting 
of two different payment systems, the 
national data will be difficult to analyze 
and interpret. This not only creates 
problems with updating payment 
systems, as indicated above, but also 
creates problems in interpreting trend 
data on health care conditions. It will be 
problematic to make national 
projections on quality of care and 
outcomes when two different coding

systems are used for encounters during 
the same time period. This is further 
amplified when single providers report 
with two different coding systems to 
small entities, but with ICD–10 to large 
entities. Comparing national data and 
assessing outcomes will be challenging. 
We solicit public comment on the 
proposed compliance date of October 1, 
2011. 
We anticipate that upon publication 
of this proposed rule in the Federal 
Register, both the industry and CMS 
will actively initiate and/or complete 
planning for implementation of ICD–10. 
While not included under the auspices 
of this proposed rule, we also 
acknowledge the impact of the 
implementation of the ASC X12 
Technical Reports Type 3, Version 
005010, hereinafter referred to as 
Version 5010, on ICD–10 
implementation timelines. Once the 
ICD–10 and Version 5010/NCPDP 
Version D.0 final rules are published, 
we estimate that both CMS and the 
industry will begin documenting the 
requirements for both ICD–10 and 
Version 5010 system changes, initiate 
and/or complete any gap analyses, and 
then undertake design and system 
changes, with Version 5010 progressing 
first, based on the need to have it in 
place prior to ICD–10 implementation to 
accommodate the increase in the size of 
the fields for the ICD–10 code sets. In 
the case of Version 5010, system 
building and testing could commence 
approximately 12 months prior to a 
Version 5010 compliance date. We 
anticipate that ICD–10 external testing 
could start approximately 15 months 
prior to the October 2011 compliance 
date. 
Upon publication of these proposed 
rules for both ICD–10 and Versions 
5010/D.0 in the Federal Register, the 
Department, through CMS, plans on 
proactively conducting outreach and 
education activities, as well as engaging 
industry leaders and other stakeholder 
organizations to provide education and 
other resources to their respective 
constituencies. These activities would 
include roundtable conference calls 
with the industry, including Medicare 
contractors, fiscal intermediaries and 
carriers; hospitals; physicians; other 
providers; and other stakeholders. 
CMS will also develop and make 
available ‘‘Frequently Asked Questions’’ 
documents, fact sheets, and other 
supporting education and outreach 
materials for partner dissemination. 
Other potential activities will be 
identified and developed based on 
stakeholder input. The draft proposed 
timeline shown below is for preliminary 
planning purposes, and represents our 
best estimate, given our current 
knowledge, of what an implementation 
timetable might look like. It is subject to 
revision as updated information 
becomes available. We solicit industry 
and other stakeholder comments on our 
timeline assumptions and our proposed 
education and outreach strategy.

IX. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
This document does not impose 
information collection and 
recordkeeping requirements. 
Consequently, it need not be reviewed 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget under the authority of the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501 through 3520). 
X. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of items 
of correspondence we normally receive 
on Federal Register documents 
published for comment, we are not able 
to acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the DATES section of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document. 
XI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Overall Impact 
We have examined the impacts of this 
rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 on Regulatory Planning and 
Review (September 30, 1993, as further 
amended), the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980, Pub. L. 
96–354) (as amended by the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–121), 
section 1102(b) of the Social Security 
Act, section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104–4), Executive Order 13132 on 
Federalism (August 4, 1999), and the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 
804(2)). 
Executive Order 12866 (as amended 
by Executive Order 13258 and Executive 
Order 13422, which modifies the list of 
criteria used for regulatory review) 
directs agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). A regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA) must be prepared for major rules 
with economically significant effects 
($100 million or more in any 1 year). We 
consider this proposed rule to be a 
major rule, as it will have an impact of 
over $100 million on the economy. The 
RIA section of this proposed rule 
explains our calculations for costs and 
benefits. We attempt to provide 
information for the impact analysis, 
focusing on savings projections and cost 
estimates. Tables 13 and 14 summarize 
cost benefit projections. We solicit 
comments on these data during the 
comment period for this proposed rule. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 also requires that 
agencies assess the anticipated costs and 
benefits before issuing any rule whose 
mandate requires spending in any 1 year 
of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation in any 1 year by 
State, local, or tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. That 
threshold level is currently 
approximately $130 million. Based on 
our analysis, we anticipate that the 
private sector would incur costs 
exceeding $130 million per year in the 
first 2 years following publication of the 
final rule. Our analysis indicates that 
States would not experience costs 
exceeding $130 million. 
The anticipated benefits and costs of 
these proposed modifications to the 
medical data code sets, and other issues 
raised in section 202 of the UMRA, are 
addressed later in this document. In 
addition, under section 205 of the 
UMRA (2 U.S.C. 1535), having 
considered at least three alternatives 
that are referenced in the RIA section of 
this proposed rule, HHS has concluded 
that the provisions in this proposed rule 
are the most cost-effective alternative for 
implementing HHS’ statutory objective 
of administrative simplification. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule (and subsequent final 
rule) that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
Executive Order 13132 requires the 
opportunity for meaningful and timely 
input by State and local officials in the 
development of rules that have 
Federalism implications. The 
Department consulted with appropriate 
State and Federal agencies, including 
tribal authorities and Native American 
groups, as well as private organizations. 
These private organizations included 
WEDI and the Designated Standard 
Maintenance Organization (DSMO) 
coordinating committee according to 
section 1178(c)(3) of the Social Security 
Act. 
In order to validate the fiscal and 
operational impact of this rule on State 
Medicaid agencies, current data on costs 
for States to implement a new code set 
would be necessary. We reference in the 
RIA of this proposed rule industry 
studies that were conducted and that 
may provide some insight into this 
information for States. In addition, 
during the comment period, we hope 
that State Medicaid agencies will 
provide any additional and/or updated 
information. 
The Department has examined the 
effects of provisions in this proposed 
rule as well as the opportunities for 
input by the States to the proposed rule. 
The Federalism implications of the 
proposed rule are consistent with the 
provisions of the Administrative 
Simplification subtitle of HIPAA by 
which the Department is required by the 
Congress to promulgate standards for 
the interchange of certain health care 
information via electronic means. Under 
section 1178(a)(1) of the Act, these 
standards preempt contrary State law. 
The States are invited to comment on 
this section and all sections of this 
proposed rule. The Department 
concludes that the policy in this 
proposed rule has been assessed in 
accordance with the principles, criteria, 
and requirements in Executive Order 
13132; that this proposed rule is not 
inconsistent with that Order; that this 
proposed rule would not impose 
significant additional costs and burdens 
on the States; and that this proposed 
rule would not affect the ability of the 
States to discharge traditional State 
governmental functions. 
1. Regulatory Flexibility Act—Impact on 
Small Businesses 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires agencies to analyze options for 
regulatory relief of small entities. For 
purposes of the RFA, small entities 
include small businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and small governmental 
jurisdictions. Most hospitals and most 
other providers and suppliers are small 
entities, either by nonprofit status or by 
qualifying as small businesses under the 
Small Business Administration’s 
(SBA’s) size standards (revenues of $6.5 
million to $31.5 million in any 1 year). 
For details, see the SBA’s Web site at 
http://sba.gov/idc/groups/public/
documents/sba_homepage/serv_
sstd_tablepdf.pdf (refer to Sector 62) 
(accessed 8–12–08). 
We discuss the impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities in 
section XI.D of this document. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires us 
to prepare a regulatory impact analysis 
if a rule may have a significant impact 
on the operations of a substantial 
number of small rural hospitals. This 
analysis must conform to the provisions 
of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes 
of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define 
a small rural hospital as a hospital that 
is located outside of a Metropolitan 
Statistical Area and has fewer than 100 
beds. (See the discussion at section XI.D 
for our discussion of the expected 
impact on small rural hospitals.)

B. Anticipated Effects 
1. Objective 
The objective of this regulatory 
impact analysis is to summarize the 
costs and benefits of moving from ICD– 
9–CM to ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
code sets in the context of the current 
health care environment. 
The following are the three key issues 
that we believe necessitate the need to 
update from ICD–9–CM to ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS: 
• ICD–9–CM is out of date and 
running out of space for new codes. 
• ICD–10 is the international standard 
to report and monitor diseases and 
mortality, making it important for the 
U.S. to adopt ICD–10 classifications for 
reporting and surveillance. 
• ICD codes are core elements of 
many HIT systems, making the 
conversion to ICD–10 necessary to fully 
realize benefits of HIT adoption. 
For a more detailed discussion of the 
limitations of ICD–9–CM, please refer to 
section III.B in the preamble of this 
proposed rule. No other viable 
alternatives to adopting ICD–10 were 
identified. The costs and benefits for 
moving from ICD–9–CM to ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS were assessed within 
the requirements of the Executive 
Orders and Acts cited in section XI.B of 
this regulatory impact analysis. 
2. Background 
Two major papers analyzed the costs 
and benefits of adopting the ICD–10 
codes: (1) a March 2004 RAND study, 
http://www.rand.org/pubs/ 
technical_reports/2004/ 
RAND_TR132.pdf (accessed 8–12–08) 
and (2) an October 2003 study by the 
Robert E. Nolan Company 
commissioned by the Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield Association, http:// 
www.renolan.com/healthcare/
icd10study_1003.pdf (accessed 8–12– 
08). Both studies agreed that the basic 
elements driving the cost of 
implementing the ICD–10 code sets 
were training, productivity losses, and 
system changes. Table 6 summarizes the 
differences in cost and benefit estimates 
between the two studies. 
In considering the studies, HHS 
evaluated both on the basis of the 
following criteria: 
• The depth and completeness of the 
analysis and supporting evidence for the 
conclusions; 
• Data sources and a presentation of 
the data limitations; 
• The perceived objectivity of the 
analysis as demonstrated by the 
discussion of data sources and the rigor 
of the analysis; 
• The point of view the analysis 
adopted—whether from the general 
societal perspective or from a specific 
point of view (for example, from the 
payer or provider view point); and 
• HHS’ ability to explain and justify 
in a Regulatory Impact Statement the 
findings and conclusions presented in 
each of the studies. 
a. Nolan and RAND Studies: Analysis 
and Limitations 
ICD–10 code sets would likely 
represent the most complex of all the 
HIPAA code sets. Also, because the 
ICD–9–CM code set is used for reporting 
diagnoses, adoption of the new codes 
will likely touch every provider who 
submits diagnostic codes, and every 
payer that processes health care claims. 
Given the lack of quantifiable data, both 
studies were compelled to make 
numerous assumptions as to the 
possible behavioral changes resulting 
from the new codes. The key differences 
are how each study justifies its 
assumptions and seeks to provide 
detailed and plausible scenarios. 
As the Nolan and RAND reports were 
the only studies available at the time 
that outlined the costs and benefits for 
transitioning from ICD–9 to ICD–10, we 
employ them for purposes of this impact 
analysis along with their associated 
assumptions and limitations. We later 
discuss HHS’ analysis based on our 
selected model. Overall, NOLAN 
estimates that it will cost providers and 
payers between $5.5 billion and $13.5 
billion to implement ICD–10–CM and 
PCS code sets. In addition, Nolan 
expects there to be an additional $150 
million to $380 million in lost 
productivity. 
i. Training 
Nolan expects the following number 
of individuals would require training on 
the new codes: 
TABLE 1—NOLAN STUDY—TRAINING ESTIMATES 
* Category Number of staff Hours 
Training cost 
in millions $ 
(including 
follow-up) 
Full-time coders ........................................................................................................................... 142,170 24–40 94–141 
Physicians/practitioners ............................................................................................................... 754,636 4–12 332–499 
Part-time coders and other clinicians .......................................................................................... 1,455,015 4–40 456–684 
Other hospital .............................................................................................................................. 44,207 4–40 30–45 
Payer plans .................................................................................................................................. 117,020 4–80 54–80 
* Nolan adapted from chart 6 on page 17. 
The Nolan study estimates that 
142,170 coders would need training at 
a cost of $94 million to $141 million. 
But the study does not differentiate 
between hospital-based coders and 
those working in physician offices and 
clinics. In addition, Nolan identifies 
another set of 44,207 coders as ‘‘other 
hospital’’ coders, but there is no 
explanation as to which hospitals are 
included under this category versus 
‘‘full-time coders,’’ nor does the Nolan 
study document the sources of its 
numbers. According to the American 
Health Information Management 
Association Web site (http:// 
www.ahima.org, accessed 8–12–08), 
there are more than 51,000 AHIMA 
members. As AHIMA is the leading 
professional association representing 
specially educated and certified health 
information management professionals 
throughout the healthcare industry, we 
assume, as does the RAND study, that 
this represents the majority of the 
number of full-time coders employed in 
hospitals. Without supporting 
documentation, we cannot accept 
Nolan’s estimate of 142,000 full-time 
coders. 
The Nolan study estimates that 
754,000 physicians would require 
between 4 to 12 hours of training at a 
cost of $332 million to $500 million, or 
$440 to $663 per physician. Given the 
wide use of ‘‘super-bills’’ (forms with 
codes for diagnosis and procedure codes 
with their descriptions that are most 
frequently used by physician practices, 
and that may or may not include 
specific charges) to document 
encounters in office-based practices,

5 Nolan, page 6. 
and familiarity with the few codes for 
which they routinely bill, it seems 
unlikely that most physicians would 
require or desire training on the new 
code sets. We believe that only some 
physicians would have an interest in 
learning the new system. Also, it seems 
likely that large practices would have 
sufficient need to hire either a part-time 
or full-time coder. In comparison, 
RAND estimates that only one out of ten 
(45,000) physicians would want up to 8 
hours of training, and these would most 
likely be emergency room physicians 
and surgeons. For these reasons, we 
believe the RAND numbers more 
accurately reflect the number of 
physicians likely to seek training. 
Nolan predicts that some 1.5 million 
clinicians, including nurses and 
physician assistants, would seek 
training in the ICD–10 codes at a cost 
ranging between $313 and $470 per 
clinician. As in the case of physician 
training, the Nolan study does not 
present any explanation for why over a 
million nurses and physician assistants 
would want or require training. In some 
offices, clinicians may perform coding 
along with their clinical duties, but in 
most cases, we again expect that super- 
bills or similar forms would be used 
which require minimal knowledge of 
the coding structure. On this basis, we 
rejected Nolan’s estimates of clinician 
training. 
Training would be necessary for 
insurance and health plans that make 
payments to providers based on the 
submitted codes. The Nolan study 
estimates that 117,000 coders working 
for health plans would require between 
4 to 80 hours of training at a cost of 
between $54 million to $80 million. In 
this regard, both studies are close on 
their estimate of the number of 
personnel and time required for 
training, with RAND estimating 150,000 
personnel requiring 4 to 8 hours of 
retraining.2 However, the Nolan study is 
rather opaque in providing evidence or 
rationale for its conclusions. 
ii. Productivity Losses 
The Nolan study distinguishes 
between short-term (6 months to a year) 
and permanent productivity loss. 
TABLE 2—SHORT-TERM PRODUCTIVITY LOSS 
Payer and provider productivity losses resulting from claims rework .......................................................... $300–600 (million) in first year. 
Coder productivity loss for first 3 months ..................................................................................................... $300–440 (million). 
Nolan, adapted from Chart 8, page 20. 
TABLE 3—LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY LOSS 
Coder productivity loss resulting from the greater number of codes and more complex coding structure ............................ $152–380 million. 
Nolan, adapted from Chart 9, page 21. 
The Nolan study concludes that the 
extra time ICD–10 requires for coding is 
largely the result of initial unfamiliarity 
with the code structure and 
terminology. However, because of the 
intrinsic greater complexity of coding 
and vastly greater number of codes, 
Nolan assumes there would be a 
permanent loss of productivity of $152 
million to $380 million. 
The American Health Information 
Management Association (AHIMA) and 
the American Hospital Association 
(AHA) conducted a field test of the ICD– 
10–CM codes and issued their report in 
September 2003. The full report is 
available at http://www.AHIMA.org. The 
study imposed certain limitations that 
may have contributed to the extended 
times in using the new code system (the 
principal limitation being the absence of 
digital documents which would enable 
faster searching for codes).3 However, 
overall, the study found that with 
adequate training and proper coding 
tools, there should be no loss in coder 
productivity in the long-run (AHIMA/ 
AHA study, page 25). 
Nolan also cites Canadian sources 
who reported productivity losses during 
the first 6 months after ICD–10 was 
implemented, but according to its 
source, production rebounded to pre- 
ICD–10 levels.4 
iii. System Changes 
Nolan’s analysis of the cost to make 
system changes rests largely on 
statements made by various executives 
who cited the costs of preparing for Y2K 
and HIPAA. The Nolan study analysis 
consisted of adjusting those figures for 
factors such as avoiding hardware 
purchases, or the inclusion of security 
and privacy costs in the HIPAA 
estimates. Nolan estimates the system 
changes based on an aggregate number 
that includes privacy and security, and 
then backs out the cost for 
implementing the code portion of the 
costs, concluding that 50 to 70 percent 
of the costs would be attributable to 
code changes.5 However, there is no 
explanation for how Nolan determined 
this number. The following table 
summarizes Nolan’s estimates for the 
cost of implementing system changes in 
the various affected health care sectors. 
The estimates are drawn from tables in 
the Nolan report.

In estimating the costs of the system 
changes, Nolan compared the 
implementation of the codes sets to the 
implementation of the HIPAA sets and 
broke down the activities into the 
following tasks:

HIPAA required a number of system 
changes and adoption of a number of 
new code sets. In the final HIPAA 
transaction rule, we estimated the cost 
to implement the Administrative 
Simplification provisions to be 
approximately $7.1 billion (65 FR 
50356). 
Nolan estimates that system changes 
in hospitals would cost between $2 
billion and $6 billion, and $645 million 
to $2.2 billion for implementing the 
ICD–10 codes in physician and group 
practice offices. Nolan, however, does 
not take into account that hospitals 
would need to implement both ICD–10– 
CM and ICD–10–PCS, whereas 
physician and group practice offices 
will only need to implement ICD–10– 
CM. Payers would incur $400 million to 
$1 billion in costs to implement the 
ICD–10 code sets. The total cost of 
$3.045 billion to $9 billion represents 
from 43 to 127 percent, respectively, of 
the $7.1 billion estimated for 
implementing the HIPAA provisions for 
both provider and plan costs. In 
addition, the Nolan study separately 
identifies the system change costs for 
government programs, including 
Medicaid and Medicare, at between 
$700 million and $1.4 billion.6 In 
analyzing the cost of implementing 
ICD–10 code sets for Medicaid State 
plans, Nolan cites several sources that 
refer to the costs of modifying the 
Medicaid Management Information 
Systems (MMIS), which may require 
some modifications to accept payments 
based on the new codes. 
Nolan did not estimate any 
quantitative benefit which is a serious 
shortcoming of the study, given the 
Office of Management and Budget’s 
(OMB’s) guidance on preparing cost/ 
benefit analyses for major rules. 
Based on the studies’ designs, it 
appears that the RAND and Nolan 
reports had different target audiences; 
therefore, their respective 
methodologies differed. RAND 
considered costs and benefits from the 
perspective of the general public, while 
the Nolan study focused on major health 
care sectors. A key result of this 
difference is that potential winners and 
losers in each health care sector are not 
clearly highlighted in the RAND report. 
RAND’s methodology is more 
analytical than Nolan’s methodology, 
albeit there are still limitations to the 
RAND report. Both RAND and Nolan 
express the uncertainty in their 
estimates through presenting ranges for 
their estimates. RAND, however, 
provides more detailed scenarios and 
offers a qualitative analysis of the 
uncertainty in the variables it uses in its 
scenarios. Nolan does not offer any 
explanation for its ranges. Both studies 
conducted extensive literature reviews. 
In conducting the cost and benefit 
analysis, both reports dissected the 
estimates into a one-time cost and one- 
time and recurring benefits in the RAND 
study. In both the Nolan and RAND 
studies, nursing homes, clinical labs, 
Durable Medical Equipment suppliers 
(DMEPOS), third party administrators, 
clearinghouses, and small/medium 
insurers were excluded from their 
analysis. Table 6 below provides a high- 
level comparison between the RAND 
and Nolan studies. 
Although RAND does not explicitly 
break down its analysis beyond the 
broad categories of ‘‘payer’’, ‘‘hospital’’, 
‘‘physician’’, for costs of coding, 
productivity losses, returned and 
improper claims, by examining the costs 
of the generic categories of training, 
administration, and claims processing, 
RAND’s approach cuts across the 
subcategories of providers and payers. 
Only in the analysis of system change 
costs is there a defect in RAND’s 
method. From the documentation 
provided, RAND conducted interviews 
with executives of health care systems 
of various sizes as measured by 
membership.7 It is not clear, however, 
the span of the interviewed health 
systems in terms of the types of 
providers. Without more details, we 
cannot conclusively determine the 
extent of the system conversion costs of 
long-term care facilities, home care 
providers and other non-hospital 
organizations. It may be that the system 
conversion costs for these types of 
health providers are underrepresented. 
Similarly, it is not clear how far-ranging 
is RAND’s examination of the various 
types of payer organizations. It is 
possible that third party administrators, 
clearinghouses, and small health plans 
may be underrepresented in the 
analysis.

Finally, Nolan also argues that 
implementing ICD–10 codes would lead 
to increased incidences of fraud and 
abuse in its introductory period. We 
agree with this view since we anticipate 
that people may take advantage of the 
initial ambiguity of the new codes, but 
we also believe that the greater 
precision of the coding requirements 
would eventually lead to lower 
incidences of abuse. 
Both studies presented valuable input 
and relevant information, but based on 
questions regarding the methods and 
assumptions presented in each report, 
we believe that neither should be used 
as the sole basis for an ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS impact analysis. To 
address these shortcomings, HHS 
convened a workgroup to develop a 
framework consistent with OMB’s 
requirements for an impact analysis. 
The framework extracted relevant points 
from both the RAND and Nolan studies, 
and also identified new internal and 
external data sources. 
Also taken under consideration for 
purposes of this impact analysis, is a 
report authored by the Hay Group, Inc., 
‘‘Examining the Cost of Implementing 
ICD–10’’, commissioned by America’s 
Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) 
(hereinafter referred to as the AHIP 
report’’) in October 2006. 8 This report, 
a white paper based on the previously- 
referenced RAND and Nolan reports on 
ICD–10 implementation, is intended to 
identify the primary sources of ICD–10 
implementation costs. It includes a 
review of existing cost estimates from 
RAND and Nolan and uses those 
estimates to develop preliminary 
estimates of the likely cost to the U.S. 
health system as a whole. Its scope 
includes health care providers, private 
payers, and government payers. The 
types of costs considered are systems 
implementation, training, and provider 
contract renegotiations. Only direct 
implementation costs are considered. 
The report does not include the cost of 
work that must be re-done due to error 
rates or other forms of lost productivity. 
For purposes of this regulatory impact 
analysis, we used the AHIP report as a 
litmus test in that it was authored a full 
2 years after the RAND and Nolan 
reports, and held the potential for 
providing more updated cost estimates. 
However, it again relies on RAND and 
Nolan data, and notes that its cost 
estimates would still have to be adjusted 
for inflation, which we have already 
done for this impact analysis. The AHIP 
report also lacks discussion regarding 
the monetary benefits that would occur 
once ICD–10 is implemented. It also 
does not specifically reference how their 
estimates were calculated or the sources 
for many of their assumptions. 
We agree with selected segments of 
the AHIP report, namely its conclusion 
that implementation of ICD–10 for 
Medicare and Medicaid would run 
between $250 and $370 million; we 
estimate an average of $315 million. 
Where our analysis and the AHIP report 
differ is in the cost for the training of 
physicians on the ICD–10 codes sets, 
and in the cost of re-negotiating 
contracts. In the case of the former, we 
continue to believe that there will be a 
minimum number of physicians who 
will desire such training, leaving it 
instead to their staff coders, or the use 
of ‘‘super-bills’’ to update their coding 
information. In the case of the latter, we 
continue to believe that contract re- 
negotiation costs are considered for 
purpose of this analysis to be a cost of 
doing business, and would take place 
whether or not the transition to ICD–10 
took place. We believe that the level of 
effort to re-negotiate contracts for the 
purposes of implementing ICD–10 
would not be significantly different 
from other policy-related changes 
requiring contract renegotiations. We 
also do not account for AHIP’s increase 
in system implementation costs of 
between $115 to $416 million due to an 
accelerated implementation of the ICD– 
10 code sets versus an orderly, staged 
rollout as we have proposed. 
3. Framework for Impact Analysis 
a. The Impact Analysis Workgroup 
HHS created a workgroup from a 
cross-agency, multidisciplinary team 
with actuarial, economic and coding 
subject matter expertise from HHS’ 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Planning and Evaluation (ASPE); 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC)/ 
National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS); Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS); and the Office 
of the National Coordinator for Health 
Information Technology (ONC). The 
workgroup sought guidance from the 
Department of Defense (DoD), the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 
and contacts from other countries that 
have implemented ICD–10, to lead the 
cost-benefit analysis for transition from

ICD–9–CM to ICD–10–CM and ICD–10– 
PCS. Also, Actuarial Research 
Corporation (ARC) was hired to help the 
team evaluate and update the data 
sources and available information. The 
team critically reviewed several cost- 
benefit studies and international 
experiences with ICD–10 
implementation. Data were drawn from 
the RAND study (sponsored by NCVHS), 
the Nolan study (sponsored by the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield Association), the 
American Health Information 
Management Association (AHIMA), and 
CMS. 
In 2005, the workgroup began the 
analysis of the costs and benefits by 
examining and comparing the RAND 
and the Nolan studies. While both 
contain useful information, the 
requirements for regulatory impact 
estimates demand a somewhat different 
framework. The workgroup 
incorporated the basic results from both 
studies, as well as the Secretary’s vision 
of health care information technology, 
and reflected costs and benefits by year 
based on assumed implementation 
schedules. 
The workgroup’s analysis assumes 
that the implementation of ICD–10 code 
sets would be coordinated with existing 
HHS health information technology 
initiatives, and include the required 
changes to dependent regulations and 
standards. HHS health initiatives, such 
as public health/biosurveillance, disease 
registries, quality monitoring, utilization 
review, and pay for performance, could 
employ either ICD–9–CM or ICD–10– 
CM and ICD–10–PCS code sets. 
Conversion costs from ICD–9–CM to 
ICD–10 code sets are unavoidable and 
do not include costs associated with the 
American Standards Committee (ASC) 
X12N version 5010 standard. ICD–9–CM 
is an adopted HIPAA code set and the 
adopted HIPAA Transaction standard 
(ANSI ASC X12N version 4010/4010A1) 
does not support ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10–PCS code sets. Also, the CMS IPPS 
uses ICD–9–CM-based Diagnostic 
Related Groups (DRGs), and the annual 
regulatory IPPS update would require 
conversion to ICD–10-based DRGs. 
Regulatory and standards changes, 
including implementation of Version 
5010 must occur before, or parallel to, 
conversion to ICD–10–CM and ICD–10– 
PCS code sets, with sufficient notice to 
the industry to reconfigure systems, 
policies and methodologies. For 
initiatives in the early stages of 
development, costs to implement ICD– 
9–CM now, with conversion to ICD–10 
code sets later, could be avoided by 
direct conversion to ICD–10 code sets 
concurrently with the initiatives. 
The following is a detailed discussion 
of the workgroup’s approach, method, 
and assumptions underlying its costs/ 
benefit analysis. 
First, we present an overview of HHS’ 
approach to estimating the costs and 
benefits based largely on the RAND 
study but also drawing from the Nolan 
study and the AHIMA/AHA study.9 The 
second part of this section describes in 
detail the assumptions and models that 
RAND developed for its estimates and 
which were adapted for this analysis. 
The workgroup’s calculations began 
with the RAND 10 estimates, 
incorporating additional information 
from CMS, and some input from 
Nolan.11 For each category for which 
RAND provided a range of high and low 
costs, a point estimate was generated. 
When RAND did not include a specific 
estimate, HHS’ point estimate was based 
on the midpoint of their high and low 
estimates. RAND’s descriptions and 10- 
year numbers were used to create a year- 
by-year spread of both costs and 
benefits. Modifications were made after 
reconsideration of the RAND study 
regarding their calculations. These 
modifications included the addition of 
productivity losses for outpatient 
claims; the separation of costs from the 
benefits for rejected and improper 
claims; and reconciliation of what were 
considered inconsistencies in the RAND 
study. We selected the computed values 
from the text of the RAND report rather 
than relying on the values presented in 
the tables. 
HHS also examined estimates from 
the Nolan study. Nolan specifically 
estimated outpatient productivity 
losses, a cost that RAND did not 
estimate. For outpatient productivity, 
the Impact Analysis Work group 
assumed the short-term impact may be 
very small in terms of extra time per 
claim, but because of the large number 
of claims, the loss was judged to be 
significant. In its analysis, Nolan 
identifies potential productivity and 
other losses for physician and facilities. 
RAND did not examine the possible loss 
of productivity for physician and other 
outpatient claims. We believe that there 
may be a productivity loss of outpatient 
and physician office-based services. The 
loss per claim may be very small, but 
because of the huge volume of physician 
and outpatient facility claims, the 
productivity loss may be significant. 
To allow analysis of longer-term 
conversion impacts, HHS’ estimates are 
moved to a year-by-year basis. Also, 
since we expect new procedures to be 
introduced each year, the savings from 
the introduction of the new codes are 
estimated to increase annually over the 
period for which the analysis was 
conducted. 
For two benefit categories, ‘‘fewer 
rejected’’ and ‘‘improper claims,’’ RAND 
estimated a net cost of zero over the first 
5 years, expecting that there would be 
some short-term losses before benefits 
materialized. For the purpose of 
calculating both year-by-year estimates 
and 10-year estimates, these categories 
are included on the cost side as well as 
on the benefit side. This is reflected by 
including costs of rejected and improper 
claims for the first 2 years. 
The next section details the 
assumptions used to estimate the costs 
and benefits, and the models used to 
estimate the benefits. Upper and lower 
bound estimates are also presented. 
4. Assumptions Underlying the Cost and 
Benefit Analysis 
The estimates for the impact of 
replacing ICD–9–CM with ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS code sets as the 
HIPAA standard code sets is based 
primarily on the RAND analysis 
previously cited. After reviewing that 
report versus other reports (for example, 
Nolan), comments from other entities, 
experience from other countries, and 
conversations with government 
analysts, we adapted the RAND results 
as the base for developing the regulatory 
impact estimates. As noted above, we 
adopted the RAND approach and results 
but made several modifications to the 
underlying RAND estimates. 
5. Impacted Entities 
Entities covered under HIPAA would 
be required to comply with the 
provisions of this proposed rule once 
finalized. Covered entities include all 
health plans, all health care 
clearinghouses, and health care 
providers that transmit health 
information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a standard. In 
the sections that follow, we attempt to 
outline the ICD–10 transition cost 
impacts to various covered entities; 
however, we acknowledge that the cost 
analysis for training, productivity loss, 
and system changes are impacts of 
varying degrees on all covered entities. 
There are multiple ways to implement 
the ICD–10 code sets. As the codes will 
be integrated into systems and

processes, some providers, plans, and 
vendors may decide to populate the new 
codes throughout their entire system at 
once, or translate the codes on a flow 
basis as they are used. Integration of the 
codes in many cases will be determined 
by the extent to which the available 
granularity is needed in transactions. 
Many small and specialty practices 
may continue to submit paper claims as 
well, using preprinted forms that 
include all of the appropriate codes 
required for use in such offices. In most 
instances small practices and direct 
billing practitioners may assign the 
diagnosis themselves and may include 
the ICD–10 code on the paper billing 
form. As time goes on, we anticipate 
that the industry will migrate to the full 
use of the more robust codes to realize 
the full benefit potential of ICD–10. 
We solicit industry and other 
stakeholder comments on ICD–10 
integration and use of workarounds. 
6. Estimated Costs 
As identified in both the Nolan and 
RAND studies, HHS estimates the 
following three basic categories of costs: 
• Training. 
• Productivity Losses. 
• Systems Changes. 
In general, costs may be categorized 
into one-time costs and recurring costs. 
In our analysis, some costs are 
considered one-time costs associated 
with conversion and training, which 
will be expended within less than a 
year. Other costs, such as the cost for 
additional claims processing resulting 
from errors and delays in implementing 
system changes, are projected to extend 
out for several years and are considered 
recurring costs. (see Table 13a) Both 
RAND and Nolan identify short-term (6 
months or less) and long-term 
productivity losses (extending beyond 
the initial 6-month period). 
For purposes of this analysis, we 
consider a primary estimate to include 
all estimated costs, and estimated 
benefits incorporating both one-time 
and recurring costs, extended over a 15- 
year period based on the data provided 
from the RAND and Nolan studies. 
(Please refer to Table 13a and b for more 
information on costs and benefits as 
well as primary estimates). 
In developing our estimates for both 
the costs and benefits of converting to 
the ICD–10 codes, we developed ranges, 
intended to express the uncertainty in 
our point estimates. The low point of 
each range represents for the most part, 
half of the point estimate, with the high 
point of the range representing a 
doubling of the point estimate. 
For some of the cost estimates, we use 
the higher end of the scale to be more 
conservative. For example, when we 
suggested that training would take four 
to eight hours, we based our 
calculations on eight hours. Also, we 
use a 15-year timeframe to show the 
point at which benefits exceed costs. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, in 
some instances we base our ranges on 
that of the RAND study and extend 
them out over 15 years. Also, because 
our analysis shows that costs will be 
expended within the first 3–5 years, in 
most cases we use the midpoint of our 
ranges for the primary estimate. 
We also estimate that there will be a 
phase-in of costs. In most cases, costs 
begin showing in the 2 years prior to 
implementation and zero out the year 
after implementation. The only 
exception is the costs for improper and 
returned claims, which we estimate will 
not be incurred until after 
implementation since claims using ICD– 
10 will not be submitted until after the 
implementation date. 
In terms of a phase-in of benefits, we 
do this in order to show that benefits 
will increase the more the industry 
becomes familiar with using the new 
codes. We do not expect benefits to 
begin until the year after 
implementation, but will continue to 
increase each year thereafter with 100 
percent of the benefit being realized 5– 
6 years after implementation. 
Since we base our figures on 2004 
dollars, for purposes of this analysis, we 
account for inflation by increasing the 
cost estimates by the Consumer Price 
Index (CPU–I) figures from 2004 to 2007 
and the benefit estimates by the growth 
rate in the National Health Expenditure 
accounts for 2005 to 2007. 
For estimation of the costs estimates, 
we divide the CPI–U annual index for 
2007 by 2004’s index to determine the 
adjustment factor in which to apply to 
each cost estimate and range. This 
adjustment factor equals approximately 
1.098.12 Since the cost estimates for 
implementing ICD–10 are not tied to 
medical services, we feel that the CPI– 
U is reasonable to use for adjusting for 
inflation. That is, most of the costs are 
so heavily allocated to the first few 
years, the inflation adjustment does not 
have a significant effect. 
For the benefit growth factor pre- 
implementation, we use the growth in 
national health care expenditures for 
years 2005–2007, with year 2007 having 
an estimated growth rate of 1.212. For 
the growth projections for years 2012 
and beyond, we use the compounded 
growth in the U.S. population which is 
projected to grow at 0.008 per year.13 
Although we base most of our 
assumptions on the RAND study, we 
take into account the concerns 
expressed by the Nolan study that 
RAND did not raise: 
• Cash flow. 
• Contract renegotiations. 
We agree with Nolan’s assumption 
that the slowdown associated with the 
implementation of the new code sets 
may cause serious cash flow problems 
for providers. The risk of a payment 
slowdown always exists whenever a 
new payment system or policy is 
implemented. However, even with 
major policy changes, plans have 
learned over time to anticipate these 
problems and have instituted measures 
to provide periodic interim payments 
(PIP) for providers who may be affected 
by the processing slowdown. Most 
payers have learned through experience 
the cash flow needs of their providers 
and can easily set up PIPs and perform 
reconciliation at the end of the fiscal 
year. 
With respect to contract renegotiation, 
this is an activity that providers and 
payers must perform on a regular basis, 
and every time a new policy is issued. 
The implementation of the new codes 
would require contract renegotiations. 
However, we do not see the level of 
effort to be significantly greater than 
with other renegotiation efforts, 
especially in the recent past with the 
initiation of a number of prospective 
payment systems for long-term care, 
psychiatric, rehabilitation, and 
outpatient services. 
Therefore, for purposes of this impact 
analysis, we do not address the 
concerns of Nolan as stated above. 
a. Training 
For training costs associated with the 
ICD–10 transition, we account for both 
full-time and part-time coders. We 
surmise that full-time coders are 
primarily dedicated to hospital 
inpatient coding while the part-time 
coders work in outpatient ambulatory 
settings. The classifying of hospital 
inpatient coders as full-time may 
roughly represent the employment 
status of this group of coders. However, 
we believe it is more accurate to 
categorize coders based on their job 
location as inpatient or ambulatory 
setting coders. The difference in 
categorizing coders based on the job 
setting rather than full- or part-time has 
to do with the need to learn ICD–10–

PCS in addition to ICD–10–CM. All 
coders will need to learn ICD–10–CM 
while the coders working in the hospital 
inpatient setting will also need to learn 
ICD–10–PCS. This will apply to 
inpatient coders regardless of their 
status as part-time or full-time coders. 
For full-time/inpatient coder training, 
we use the estimation calculated by 
AHIMA and others that getting full-time 
coders to proficiency on both ICD–10– 
CM and ICD–10–PCS could take as little 
as a few days or up to a full 40 hours.14 
Based on AHIMA membership, we 
assume that 50,000 full-time hospital 
coders would need one week of training, 
at $2,750 per coder, which includes 
$2,200 for lost work time and $550 for 
training expenses, for a total of $137.51 
million.15 
Therefore, we estimate that the 
training costs for full-time coders 
associated with adopting ICD–10 is 
approximately $137.51 million with a 
low range estimate of approximately 
$110 million and a high of 
approximately $165 million. 
As explained previously, we expect 
training of full-time coders to start in 
2010 (the year before ICD–10 
implementation). We assume that 15 
percent of training costs will be 
expended in this year. In the following 
year (the year ICD–10 implementation 
occurs), we assume 75 percent of 
training cost will be expended in 2011 
and 10 percent of training costs in 2012. 
Estimating the distribution of coders 
in ambulatory settings is more 
complicated because not every 
ambulatory setting may employ a coder. 
In many physician and practitioner 
offices, the use of ‘‘super-bills’’— 
preprinted forms that include all of the 
appropriate codes required for use in 
such offices—minimizes the need for a 
coder. Based on our knowledge of the 
industry, in most instances physicians 
and direct billing practitioners will 
assign the diagnosis themselves and 
may include the ICD code on the billing 
form. Yet we believe that all but the 
smallest practices will have someone 
whose responsibilities either formally as 
part of their job description or 
informally include handling coding 
issues.

Based on the 2005 Statistics of U.S. 
Businesses data, our analysis suggests 
that there are approximately 179,000 
part-time coders who will require 
training on the ICD–10 CM codes, but 
not on the ICD–10–PCS codes. Based on 
contacts with industry and our own 
experience, we assumed that for every 
20 employees employed in an 
ambulatory setting, there would be one 
part-time coder. Using the size 
categories that the Office of Advocacy in 
the U.S. Small Business Administration 
created with the Statistics of U.S. 
Businesses data, we calculated the 
number of part-time coders in 
outpatient ambulatory practices with 20 
to 499 employees. (http:// 
www.census.gov/csd/susb/susb05.htm, 
accessed 8–12–08) We further assumed, 
that based on their size, the 
administrative complexities and the 
types and volume of services provided, 
that facilities with 500 or more 
employees would require full-time 
coders. Thus, we did not include 
ambulatory practices with 500 or more 
employees in our analysis of part-time 
coders. 
We also assumed that very small 
providers with between 5–10 employees 
would have someone responsible to 
manage coding issues, who would need 
some amount of training. We assume 
that the 179,000 coders would have 
training costs per coder of $550. This 
includes $440 for lost work time and 
$110 for training expenses, for an 
estimate total of $98.5 million.17 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate the cost associated with 
part-time coder training in adopting 
ICD–10 is approximately $98.50 million, 
with a low range of approximately $55 
million and a high range of $165 
million. 
Code users can include people 
outside of health care facilities— 
researchers, epidemiologists, 
consultants, auditors, claims 
adjudicator, etc. Users could also 
include people within health care 
facilities in areas such as senior 
management, clinicians, quality 
improvement, utilization management, 
accounting, business office, clinical 
departments, data analysis, performance 
improvement, corporate compliance, 
data quality, etc. AHIMA defines a user 
of coded data as anyone who needs to 
have some level of understanding of the 
coding system, because they review 
coded data, rely on reports that contain

Group within the Centers for Medicare Management 
at CMS and Sue Bowman from AHIMA. 
coded data, etc., but are not people who 
actually assign codes. 
We estimate that there are 
approximately 250,000 code users.18 We 
assume that of these 250,000 only 
150,000 work directly with codes and 
would require eight hours of training at 
approximately $250 ($31.25 per hour × 
8 hours). We estimate training costs for 
code users at $37.50 million with a low 
range estimate of $27 million and the 
high range is $55 million.19 
For physicians, we assume that only 
1 in 10 physicians, or 150,000 (there 
were a total of 1.5 million physicians in 
the U.S. as of 2005 20), would require 
training. Based on our experiences and 
the testimonies of various providers, we 
estimate physicians would only need 4 
hours of training, which is half of what 
RAND assumes, at $137 per hour. 21 
However, after conversations with 
industry experts and various physician 
types, we believe that since it is likely 
that physicians will obtain ICD–10 
training through hospital-sponsored 
staff in-services, county medical society 
in-services, continuing physician 
education programs, etc., which they 
would attend nonetheless, physician 
ICD–10 training costs will be even less. 
Based on the assumptions above, we 
estimate the cost associated with 
physician training for adopting ICD–10 
is $82.20 million with range estimates 
including a minimum of $0 and a 
maximum of $165 million. 
We invite the public to comment on 
our assumptions and to provide any 
data that may improve the accuracy of 
our analysis. 
b. Productivity Losses 
Productivity loss refers to the cost 
resulting from a slow-down in coding 
bills and claims because of the need to 
learn the new coding systems. 22 One 
can think of productivity loss as the 
number of additional staff hours that 
would be required to code the same 
number of bills and claims per hour 
before the code conversion. With the 
adoption of a new code set, there would 
be an initial loss in productivity. All 
personnel, including coders and 
practitioners, would be affected to some 
degree. Coders would be directly 
affected because of the need to learn 
new codes and definitions. Time would 
be lost, and undoubtedly some claims 
would require resubmission to payers as 
both providers and payers adjust to the 
new codes. 
i. Inpatient 
We assume that there would be a 
significant amount of short-term losses 
during the first 6 months after 
implementation. Beyond that point, we 
believe that productivity would return 
to its previous level. Studies from 
Canada and Australia have shown that 
the productivity losses disappeared 
within 6 months after transition to their 
versions of ICD–10. 
According to a field test conducted by 
the American Health Information 
Management Association (AHIMA) and 
the American Hospital Association 
(AHA) in 2003 (http://www.ahima.org/ 
icd10/documents/FinalStudy_000.pdf), 
coders reported no difference in the 
time it took to code the claims in 58 
percent of the cases. Ninety-one percent 
of the remaining records took more than 
five additional minutes over the ICD–9 
coding in part due to: 
• Unfamiliarity with the index 
structure of ICD–10; 
• Use of different main terms and 
sub-terms in ICD–10 versus ICD–9; 
• Spending more time reviewing the 
medical record; and 
• Having greater familiarity with 
ICD–9 than with ICD–10, as many 
coders had common codes memorized. 
AHIMA concluded that the 
availability of much-improved coding 
tools, more training, and increased 
familiarity with ICD–10–CM would 
significantly reduce the amount of time 
needed to code records in ICD–10–CM, 
possibly to the point where ICD–10–CM 
actually may require less coding time 
than ICD–9–CM.23 
Although the field study suggests a 
larger initial loss of coder productivity, 
the lack of training, the unavailability of 
user-friendly coding tools, and other 
limiting factors, it did not represent the 
‘‘real-world’’ conditions under which 
coding would be performed. Because of 
the restrictions and the absence of the 
‘‘real world’’ conditions under which 
we believe coders will be working once 
the ICD–10 code system is 
implemented, we did not base the 
estimate of productivity loss on the field 
study. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate that it would take coders 
1.7 additional minutes in the first 
month to code an inpatient claim that 
includes an inpatient procedure.24 We 
estimate that the first month’s 
productivity loss at 1.7 minutes per 
claim and applying this to 1.8 million 
inpatient claims requiring procedures 
per month (20,000,000 claims per year 
divided by 12 months) at $50 per hour 
or $1.41 per claim will result in 
productivity losses equaling $2.7 
million in the first month. For purposes 
of this analysis, we assume that 
resumption of productivity will increase 
the same amount each month over the 
next five months. Dividing $2.7 million 
by 6 gives a monthly increase in 
productivity of $450,000. Thus, within 
5 months following implementation of 
the ICD–10 codes for inpatient services, 
coding productivity will return to their 
pre-conversion levels and there will be 
no long-term impact on coding 
efficiency. After subtracting the 
$450,000 from each month’s lost 
productivity, we add the residual 
monthly amount of lost productivity. 
The total cost due to reduced inpatient 
productivity resulting from introduction 
of the ICD–10–CM and PCS codes is 
projected to be $8.90 million incurred 
within the first year, with a low estimate 
of approximately $0 and a high estimate 
of approximately $55 million. 
Further support for the view that 
long-term productivity will not be 
adversely affected came in a July 2007 
conversation CMS had with AHIMA.25 
AHIMA further reiterated that long-term 
productivity losses would not be 
significant. The learning curve for ICD– 
10 in an inpatient setting may be longer 
due to the need for coders to learn both 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. However, 
ICD–10–PCS has proven to be easier for 
coders to learn than ICD–9–CM 
procedures with its many 
inconsistencies. Within 2 months, 
inpatient coders would understand 
ICD–10–CM and rapidly gain a 
proficiency in its use. Within 6 months, 
inpatient coders would be highly 
proficient in its use. After 6 months, 
there would be extremely small degrees 
of loss of productivity, if any at all. 
ii. Outpatient 
In analyzing the cost of productivity 
loss in the outpatient/ambulatory setting 
we had to determine the amount of 
additional time coders would need to 
code a claim with the ICD–10–CM 
codes, and the number of claims 
processed within a given period. 
In selecting a source for the number 
of outpatient/ambulatory claims, we 
examined data from the National 
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the 
National Hospital Ambulatory Medical

Care Survey and the Nolan report. These 
surveys collect data on patient visits to 
physicians and visits to hospital 
outpatient departments and emergency 
rooms. In 2005, the NAMCS reported 
964 million physician visits. In the same 
year, the NHAMCS reported 115 million 
patient visits to emergency rooms and 
90.4 million visits to hospital outpatient 
departments. The total number of 
patient visits to outpatient medical 
settings based on the two surveys was 
1,169 million visits. 
Because we are inclined to adopt a 
conservative approach to estimating the 
costs of converting to the ICD–10 codes, 
we are using the estimate of outpatient 
claims that the Nolan report used in its 
calculation. While the NAMCS and 
NHACS surveys probably accurately 
reflect the number of patient visits, the 
number of visits may understate the 
number of claims submitted. As we 
discuss below in section iv., Improper 
and Returned Claims, a certain 
percentage of claims will be processed 
more than once. We believe that the two 
billion claim estimate accounts for the 
multiple processing of claims in 
addition to the initial processing of 
claims. 
For purposes of the analysis, we 
assume the average time to code an 
outpatient claim could take one- 
hundredth of the time for a hospital 
inpatient claim. The average time to 
code an outpatient claim takes into 
account the wide variety of outpatient 
settings and coding forms. For example, 
physician offices may use preprinted 
forms or touch-screens that require 
virtually no time to code. Clinics and 
hospital outpatient units using 
outpatient claim forms, however, may 
require more time and some may require 
as much time as inpatient claims. 
Applying the estimate of 0.017 
minutes per outpatient claim (one 
hundredth of 1.7 minutes for inpatient 
claims) to the monthly number of claims 
of 166.7 million and $50 per hour or 
$0.014 per claim, we estimate the first 
month’s productivity loss will be $2.6 
million. Applying a straight line 
assumption for the recovery or 
productivity over the next five months, 
we divided $2.6 million by six to arrive 
at $433,000. That is, productivity will 
recover from a low of $2.6 million at a 
rate of $433,000 per month for the next 
five months. Over the following 5 
months, we expect productivity to 
return to its pre-conversion level. 
In the same July 2007 CMS 
conversation referred to in the 
discussion of inpatient productivity 
loss, AHIMA noted that the productivity 
losses in an outpatient setting would be 
less than inpatient due to the need of 
coders to learn only ICD–10–CM rather 
than both ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. 
Within a few weeks, coders would 
understand most of the differences 
between ICD–9–CM and ICD–10–CM. 
Within 6 months, coders would be quite 
proficient in ICD–10–CM. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate the cost associated with 
outpatient productivity losses with 
adopting ICD–10, is approximately 
$8.56 million with a range of a $0 
minimum and a $55 million maximum. 
iii. Physician Practices 
We assume that physician practices 
will sustain an initial loss of 
productivity loss. Each practice will 
have to convert their current ‘‘super- 
bills’’ to an updated version that 
includes ICD–10 codes. AHIMA 
estimates that it will take approximately 
two hours for this conversion, with a 
one-time cost estimate of $55 per 
practice. Assuming there are 200,000 
practices nationwide, this cost equates 
to a one-time total cost of approximately 
$10.98 million, with a low range of $5.5 
million and a high range of $27 million. 
We consider this number to be high 
considering that some practices will 
have their specialty societies perform 
the ‘‘super-bill’’ conversion and supply 
it to their members. 
iv. Improper 26 and Returned Claims 
The implementation of the new code 
sets is expected to produce a temporary 
increase of coding errors especially on 
the part of physicians. To determine the 
effects of introducing code changes on 
the number of claims processing and the 
number of Medicare returned claims, we 
reviewed returned claims data for FYs 
2004, 2005 and 2006. We found that 
there appears to be a pattern of a spike 
in Medicare returned claims 3 to 6 
months following the introduction of 
ICD–9 annual code updates. The average 
percent increase in returned claims 
associated with the annual coding 
update is approximately three percent 
over the 3-year period.27 Based on our 
findings and considering that the annual 
coding update affects a relatively small 
number of codes compared to the 
proposed ICD–10 conversion, which 
will affect all diagnostic and procedure 
codes, we anticipate that the percent of 
returned claims following the 
implementation could be more than 
double the previous years’ increases. We 
expect that the percent of returned 
claims may peak at around 6–10 percent 
of the pre-implementation levels 
Relying on RAND’s estimate that the 
average overall cost of claims 
adjudication in the U.S. is roughly $22 
billion nationwide per year,28 this 
represents only a fraction of the $88 
billion total health administrative 
claims adjudication costs.29 If we 
assume that the average claim goes 
through two cycles, the overall cost of 
claims adjudication divided by the 
average number of cycles a claim makes, 
results in a cost of approximately $11 
billion per cycle per year for all 
claims.30 Based on our assumed cost of 
claims processing and the additional 
initial increase of 3 percent jump in 
erroneous claims, we estimate that the 
total cost for claims handling for plans 
and providers will be $543.29 million. 
We assume the annual cost of the 
increase in returned claims equals $329 
million (3 percent of $11 billion). In the 
first year, we expect the full annual cost 
for added claims processing. In the 
second year, we expect added 
processing costs to equal 50 percent or 
$164 million. In the third year, we 
expect processing costs to equal 15 
percent of the annual cost, or 
approximately $49.4 million. By the 
fourth year, however, we expect claims 
processing costs to begin to drop below 
their pre-conversion levels (see ‘‘Fewer 
Rejected Claims’’ and ‘‘Fewer Improper 
Claims’’ in the discussion of Benefits). 
In the first year following 
implementation, claims processing costs 
for the added returned claims are 
estimated to be $329.29 million. The 
next year, we assume the number of 
returned claims will be half of the first 
year’s level and will cost $164.64 
million to process. By the third year 
following implementation, we assume 
that returned claims will be 15 percent 
of the first year’s number and cost about 
$49.39 million. 
With the transition to ICD–10, we 
assume that eventually there will be 
fewer returned claims due to the more 
detail and better structure that ICD–10 
provides. Costs of returned claims may 
include improper claims that reflect an 
attempt on the part of suppliers and 
providers to ‘‘game’’ the system. That is, 
during the period following the 
transition, some suppliers and providers 
may attempt to abuse and possibly 
defraud the payment system, hoping 
that improperly coded claims may slip 
through plans’ payment edits. In

discussion of the benefits of 
implementing ICD–10, we have treated 
the benefits for fewer returned claims 
and fewer improper claims separately. 
In this section, we combine the cost of 
the initial increase in returned clams 
with the expected increase in improper 
claims. Therefore, for purposes of this 
impact analysis, we estimate that the 
lost productivity costs for improper and 
returned claims for transitioning to ICD– 
10, is $543.29 million with a range 
estimate of a $274 million minimum 
and a $1.1 billion maximum. 
We invite the public to comment on 
our assumptions and to provide any 
data that may improve the accuracy of 
our analysis. 
C. Systems Changes 
Although system change requirements 
may vary, all would need to support the 
expanded number of characters in ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS, as well as the 
number of available codes. Trading 
partner agreements and reimbursement 
policies would also impact system 
changes. 
In implementing the ICD–10–CM and 
PCS coding systems, large providers and 
institutions will probably need to make 
changes to their systems as well as 
perform software upgrades, while small 
providers may require only software 
upgrades. 
i. Providers and Software Vendors 
Large provider groups, chain 
providers, and institutions, such as large 
hospitals, are most likely to require 
changes to their billing systems, patient 
record systems, reporting systems and 
associated system interfaces. For 
example, mainframe-based systems will 
require changes to accommodate the 
longer diagnostic and inpatient 
procedure codes which, in turn, will 
require changes to interfaces with other 
systems such as accounting and medical 
records. The new codes may also 
require the redesign of standard and 
special reports. Small providers who 
rely on super-bills, as well as their 
home-grown systems for capturing 
patient information and claims 
submission, may only need to update 
their systems to accommodate the 
length of the new codes. Given the 
information above, we expect that 
system changes will incur costs in the 
range of $55 million to $220 million.31 
Factors that contribute to the range of 
costs include: The degree of system 
integration; the need for outside 
technical assistance; and the number of 
systems and system interfaces that must 
be updated. 
We assumed that implementation of 
the system changes upgrades would 
begin as early as 2 years in advance of 
the ICD–10 implementation date. We 
expect that large providers especially 
would need to begin this far in advance 
and that spending on system change in 
2009 would equal $20.58 million and 
would represent 15 percent of total 
provider system change costs. In the 
next year, spending would double to 30 
percent of provider system change 
expenditures and equal $41.16 million. 
In FY 2012, the year ICD–10 is to be 
implemented, we anticipate spending 
for system changes to amount to 50 
percent of provider spending on system 
changes and equal $68.60 million. The 
year following implementation, we 
expect providers and suppliers with 
small systems and some large 
organizations will still be implementing 
changes or refining their changes. In 
that year, we are assuming that about 5 
percent of the provider system change 
costs will be expended or $6.86 million. 
Thus, for purposes of this impact 
analysis, we estimate that from 2009 
through 2012, the cost of system 
changes to providers for transitioning to 
ICD–10, is approximately $137.20 
million, with a low range estimate of 
$55 million minimum and a $220 
million maximum. 
For small providers that are PC-based 
or have client-server systems that rely 
on vendor-supplied software, the 
provider may not bear any immediate 
costs for the software upgrades. Based 
on CMS’s own experience with the 
industry, most software maintenance 
contracts offer free upgrades to 
accommodate regulatory changes. Thus, 
the impact on providers that have such 
contracts will be postponed until the 
contract is renewed. Even if a provider 
were to pay for the software upgrade 
directly, an ambulatory provider would 
only require updating of the diagnostic 
codes. 
While many providers who use 
vendor-supplied software may be able to 
defer the costs of software upgrades, the 
vendor industry may have to bear, at 
least initially, the costs of such 
upgrades. In interviews RAND 
conducted with industry experts 
including association representatives, 
providers, payers, software and service 
vendors, and government officials, two 
major software vendors said it would 
take 10 percent of their labor force, one 
saying it would be spread out over a 3- 
year period. Another stated that it 
would take 50 to 100 person-years.32 
Several other software vendors that 
RAND interviewed, however, stated that 
they expect that adaptation to the ICD– 
10 codes would only take a few person- 
years. Thus, based on RAND, we 
estimate the cost of system changes for 
software vendors of transitioning to 
ICD–10, to be approximately $96.05 
million with a range of $55 million 
minimum and $137 million 33 
maximum because of the wide range of 
information and billing systems and the 
configurations of provider systems. 
As in the case with provider and 
supplier system change costs, we 
assume that beginning in FY 2009, 
software vendors will begin developing 
new software and continue the 
development and refinement through 
FY 2013. In FY 2009, vendors are 
assumed to spend 15 percent of the cost 
of software development or $14.41 
million. In FY 2010, we anticipate 
vendors will spend 30 percent of the 
cost of software development or $28.81 
million and in FY 2012, the year of 
implementation, we project vendors 
will expend 50 percent or $48.02 
million. In the next year, spending will 
continue mostly for refinement and last 
minute upgrades. The expenditures are 
calculated to be $4.81 million and 
represent 5 percent of the software 
development costs. 
ii. Payers 
We estimate that changing payer 
systems to ICD–10 may be one of the 
largest cost categories, but the cost is not 
clear and the range is variable as payers 
represent a widely varied group. System 
change costs for payers are based on 
interviews that RAND conducted with 
eight different payers. (However, the 
‘‘List of Interviewees’’ in Appendix B of 
the RAND report lists seven different 
payers, with a total of nine interviews). 
RAND divides the eight payers into 
three groups, based on their approach 
and estimate for system change. RAND 
does not disclose which payers fall into 
which of the three groups. The first 
group, which consists of three payers, 
representing 4 percent of the market, 
expects their vendors to supply the 
updates. The second group, which 
consists of three payers, representing 12 
percent of the market, notes they would 
invest 40 cents per member. The third 
group, which consists of two payers, 
representing 3 percent of the market, 
estimates costs to be $1 per member. 
Using RAND’s basic findings, we 
estimate the cost of system changes to 
payers for transitioning to ICD–10, is 
approximately $164.64 million with a 
range of $110 million minimum to $274

million maximum, based on the groups’ 
market share estimates from RAND.34 
iii. Government Systems Costs 
Government systems change estimates 
are expected to occur across a number 
of Federal and State agencies and 
include Federal transition costs. Also, to 
make costs comparable to those of the 
private sector system changes, only 
costs for logic and format changes are 
considered. The examples in this impact 
analysis are only illustrative in nature 
and are based on limited analysis. They 
are presented to illustrate the potential 
administrative costs to the Federal 
Government. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we gathered information from various 
government agencies to determine total 
government systems costs for 
implementing ICD–10. Estimates for 
State Medicaid Agencies were gathered 
from the Center for Medicaid and State 
Operations (CMSO) within CMS and 
were derived based on the state’s need 
to design, develop and implement 
changes to their systems to 
accommodate ICD–10 codes. Some 
government agencies are continuing to 
work on their cost estimates. As this 
information is still in the process of 
being analyzed and compiled, it is not 
included for purposes of this impact 
analysis. The costs outlined in Table 8, 
represent our best estimate based on the 
information available from CMS, the 
Indian Health Service (IHS), State 
Medicaid Agencies, and the Department 
of Veteran’s Affairs (VA). 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate costs for the impact on 
government systems in transitioning to 
ICD–10 include system modifications, 
payment modifications, updates to 
software applications and training for a 
total minimum cost of approximately 
$315 million, with a minimum estimate 
of $157.5 million and a maximum 
estimate of $630 million. Table 8 shows 
the cost breakouts by government 
agency.

We invite public comment on our 
assumptions, as well as comments from 
affected government agencies herein 
identified or those not identified in this 
analysis, so they may provide any 
additional and/or updated data that may 
improve the accuracy of our analysis. 
(d) Distribution of ICD–10 Transition 
Costs 
In the Table 9, we show the 
distribution of the transition costs to the 
ICD–10 codes for providers, suppliers, 
payers and software and system design 
firms. Entities are grouped by the North 
American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) and are presented at 
the firm level. The NAICS figures were 
adjusted based on the same medical 
inflation factor we used for all costs that 
are outlined above. 
As indicated earlier in this analysis, 
data was collected primarily by 
inpatient and outpatient categories (see 
Table 9). To allocate the transition costs, 
we have to use an available base which 
can serve as a proxy for apportioning 
the transition costs to the sub-groupings 
of inpatient and outpatient providers 
and suppliers. For the task of allocating 
the transition costs, we are using the 
revenue-receipts reported in the 
Services Annual Survey and the 
National Health Expenditure Accounts. 
The first step was to group providers 
and suppliers by inpatient and 
outpatient groups reflecting the level at 
which the data was available. Inpatient 
providers included: 
• Hospitals, 
• Nursing facilities. 
The group of outpatient providers and 
suppliers included: 
• Physicians and other practitioners 
(excluding dentists), 
• Outpatient care centers, 
• Medical and diagnostic imaging 
services, 
• Home health services, 
• Other ambulatory health care 
services, 
• Durable medical equipment 
suppliers. 
In column 3, we present the revenue- 
receipts for each type of provider- 
supplier, insurance carrier-third party 
administrator, and computer design firm 
expected to bear transition costs. We 
summed the revenue-receipts for each of 
the inpatient and outpatient. 
Column 4 shows the percent of the 
two groups’ revenue-receipts each

provider-supplier type comprises of the 
group’s total. 
In column 5, we apply the 
percentages to the total ICD–10 
transition costs for each provider- 
supplier type. Total inpatient transition 
costs—including productivity losses— 
from Table 9 equal $228.55 million. 
Total transition costs—including 
productivity losses—for outpatient 
providers-suppliers (from Table 9) equal 
$165.36 million, including an 
adjustment for inflation. It should be 
noted that physician costs include a 
portion of the coding training costs and 
productivity losses in addition to costs 
directly allocated to physicians and 
practices expenses. This explains the 
high percent of implementation costs to 
receipts-revenues than for the other 
outpatient providers-suppliers.

data sets are available from http://www.census.gov/econ/www.index.html. Data on the number of Durable Medical Equipment suppliers comes 
from the 2007b CMS Data Compendium http://cms/hhs.gov/DataCompendium/17_2007_Data_Compendium.asp#TopOfPage.

ices/sas/sas_data/sas54.htm, accessed 8–12–08. 
Revenue and receipts for each industry sector and sub-sector come from the Census Bureau Services Annual Survey for 2006 at B29. Rev-
enue/receipt data for NAICS codes 6211–6219, 622 and 623 come from tables 8.1–8.10. Data for codes 5415 come from tables 6.1–6.21. Rev-
enue/receipts are used to allocate ICD–10 implementation costs. Revenue/receipts were subtotaled by ambulatory provider plus DME suppliers 
(NAICS 62111–6219) and inpatient providers (NAICS 622, 623) and the percent of the subtotaled revenue/receipts for the provider/supplier was 
computed and applied to the total ICD–10 implementation costs for each of two subtotaled groupings. ICD–10 costs for ambulatory provider do 
not include the cost of system changes. Some costs, however, are included with inpatient system changes since large multi-campus, integrated 
health care facilities are likely to include their ambulatory care facilities in the cost of upgrading their information systems. 
In calculating the impact on provider/ 
suppliers, payers, third party 
administrators and computer design and 
related service firms we compared the 
total expected costs to the one-year 
revenues for each class of entities. By

doing so, we deliberately overstate the 
expected annual impact of the 
transition. In part, we did this because 
we cannot be certain that we have 
properly allocated implementation costs 
to each entity category or that we 
accounted for all costs. 
The impact on revenue-receipts of the 
transition to ICD–10 is shown. For 
inpatient providers, the impact will be 
an average increase against revenues of 
0.03 percent. For outpatient providers 
and suppliers, the average increase 
against revenues is projected to be 0.03 
percent. 
The impact on insurance carriers and 
third party administrators is expected to 
be an increase against revenues of 0.023 
percent. For system design firms, the 
impact against revenues is projected to 
be 0.048 percent. 
Because we are not able to determine 
the exact number of third party 
administrator firms or system design 
firms that will be involved or have to 
implement the ICD–10 codes, we used 
the number of firms and revenues- 
receipts shown for the applicable 
NAICS. To the degree that fewer firms 
are actually involved in the transition to 
ICD–10, our estimate of the impact is 
understated. The fewer firms 
implementing ICD–10, the smaller 
number firms over which to spread the 
implementation costs. Therefore, we are 
specifically requesting comments on 
this estimate and how many third party 
administrators and computer design 
firms will be implementing ICD–10. 
Table 10 outlines the approximate 
total estimated costs as outlined in the 
above sections. Table 10 shows both the 
minimum and maximum ranges for each 
cost as well as their corresponding 
primary estimates. We solicit comments 
from industry and other stakeholders on 
other potential entities that may be 
affected by the transition from ICD–9 to 
ICD–10 code sets.

7. Projected Benefits 
We identified six benefits of 
transitioning to ICD–10: 35 
• More accurate payments for new 
procedures: 
• Fewer rejected claims; 
• Fewer improper claims; 
• Better understanding of new 
procedures; 
• Improved disease management; 
• Better understanding of health 
conditions and health care outcomes (no 
monetary estimate made); and 
• Harmonization of disease 
monitoring and reporting world-wide 
(no monetary value was included in the 
analysis). 
In our analysis, benefits begin to 
appear in the year following the 
implementation date. Therefore, our 
total estimated benefits differ slightly 
from RAND estimates, which assumed 
phased-in benefits prior to 
implementation. All benefit estimates, 
in addition to having a point estimate 
also have a wide high to low range 
because of the uncertainties inherent in 
these estimates. We have also adjusted 
benefit figures for the projected growth 
in the population using the growth in 
national health care expenditures for 
years 2005–2007. Year 2007 is an 
estimated growth rate of which we used 
an adjusted growth factor of 21.2 
percent. For the growth projections for 
2012 and beyond, we used the 
compounded growth in the U.S 
population which is projected to grow at 
0.8 percent per year. 
a. More Accurate Payments for New 
Procedures 36 
The transition to ICD–10–PCS codes 
will allow for more accurate payments 
for new procedures. Under the current 
ICD–9 Volume 3 procedure codes there 
is little room for additional codes. It has 
been estimated that at the current rate 
of adding additional codes, the capacity 
of ICD–9 Volume 3 will reach its 
maximum by 2009. The result is that 
new and possibly more complex and 
expensive procedures are being grouped 
in with less expensive procedures. With 
introduction of the PCS codes, it is more 
likely that such new procedures will 
receive a separate code and more 
appropriate payment. We assume that 
new procedures that could receive a 
separate code under the PCS system are 
so expensive they would be unlikely to 
be performed unless, through the new 
coding, the hospital received adequate 
payment.37 
Of the approximately 20 million 
procedures performed each year, 
roughly one percent or 200,000 
procedures are new. We estimate that 
100,000 of the new procedures would be 
paid for by CMS based on the fact that 
Medicare pays for approximately one 
half of all inpatient procedures. 
Examining the historical trend for the 
number of new codes assigned each 
year, we determine that about one 
percent of new procedures received 
separate codes. Using this one percent 
assumption, the 200,000 new 
procedures would be represented by 
approximately 36 new codes (one 
percent of the 3,600 current procedure

codes in the ICD–9 Volume 3). We 
assume that three procedures would be 
performed frequently enough to be 
given their own codes. We also assume 
the three procedure codes would 
represent about 40 percent of the annual 
number of new procedures.38 
Subtracting out 40 percent of the 
procedures from 100,000 new 
procedures that CMS would pay for 
each year leaves 60,000 procedures 
represented by 33 codes that, under the 
current coding structure, may be 
inappropriately grouped and paid an 
inappropriate amount. For purposes of 
this analysis, we recognize that the odds 
that hospitals would not perform a 
procedure that was seen to have 
therapeutic value in spite of being 
underpaid are low. For this reason, we 
assume that in 10 percent or 6,000 of the 
cases involving new inpatient 
procedures that are not adequately 
reimbursed, hospitals may be 
disinclined to admit patients requiring 
the procedure. 
Finally, we estimate the opportunity 
cost of foregoing those procedures that 
would be undervalued under the 
current coding structure (and 
presumably would be properly paid 
under the PCS codes). Of 33 procedures 
that are undervalued, some may yield 
significant health benefits while the 
majority will yield small health benefits. 
Hospitals are more likely to perform the 
high benefit procedures even though 
they may be underpaid for the 
procedures. 
We assume that the average procedure 
costs approximately $12,120 and has a 
net benefit yield of $6,060. Multiplying 
the amount by the 6,000 procedures 
yields a benefit of approximately $36 
million.39 We also expect that the effects 
of the benefit are cumulative for each 
year and that every year, 6,000 
procedures will be added. 
Based on a growth rate of 6,000 per 
year, the growth in benefits would equal 
50 fold or $1.8 billion in 10 years. This 
may overstate the benefits because of 
cost reduction over time due to the 
learning curve and the introduction of 
lower cost alternative procedures. 
Rather than an increase of 50 times, a 
factor of 25 is used, resulting in an 
estimate of $909 million. For purposes 
of this impact analysis, we make a more 
conservative assumption. After the third 
year following implementation of the 
code conversion we assume an 
opportunity cost that increases $12 
million every year, with the fourth year 
showing approximately $62 million 
benefit (see Table 13b). For purposes of 
this impact analysis, we estimate that 
the benefit of more accurate payments 
for new procedures would equal 
approximately $1,032 million with a 
minimum range estimate of $121 
million and a maximum estimate of 
$1,455 million. 
We recognize that many assumptions 
underlie our estimates of more accurate 
payments and we invite comments on 
this analysis. 
b. Fewer Rejected Claims 
The Workgroup for Electronic Data 
Interchange (WEDI) has stated that 
‘‘[The] greater detail [of ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS] may help reduce the 
number of cases where copies of the 
medical record need to be submitted for 
clarification for claims adjudication.’’ 40 
For example, in ICD–10–CM, the injury 
codes provide excellent detail in 
identifying the fracture site of a 
malunion or non-union; the ICD–9–CM 
codes for malunion and non-union do 
not identify fracture site. If the payer 
required this information to adjudicate 
the claim, the provider would need to 
send a claims attachment. Also, in ICD– 
10–CM, the injury codes provide 
excellent detail in identifying bilateral 
fractures. If a patient fractured both 
wrists, two codes could be assigned; one 
code identifying the left wrist fracture 
and a separate code identifying the right 
wrist fracture could be reported. ICD–9– 
CM does not provide this detail and if 
a provider wanted to report fractures of 
both wrists and reported the diagnosis 
code twice, the claim would be rejected. 
Based on the WEDI assumption, we 
estimate the average cost per cycle of 
processing a claim at a total of $12 
billion per year for all claims. RAND 
makes the assumption that using ICD– 
10 code sets would decrease the amount 
of claims sent back by one percent. This 
gives a $120 million annual benefit 
(0.01 x 12 billion).41 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate approximately $100 million 
per year in benefits after phased-in 
benefits for the first four years, 
compounded annually by a 0.8 percent 
growth in the population. We assume an 
extended phase-in for this benefit 
because of the lag time in receiving 
claims data showing the effects of the 
new system that will lead to delays in 
taking advantage of the improved and 
more precise data. 
We also assume that returned claims 
will temporarily increase in the initial 
years. We discussed the temporary 
increase of returned claims in section b. 
iv., above, under Productivity Losses. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate that the benefit of fewer 
rejected claims would equal 
approximately $1,015.41 million with a 
minimum range estimate of $242 
million and a maximum estimate of 
$3,031 million. We invite the public to 
comment on our assumptions and to 
provide any data that will improve the 
accuracy of our analysis. 
c. Fewer Improper Claims 
The distinction that we are seeking to 
make in this section is between claims 
that would be returned because of 
mistakes in coding resulting from 
confusion about the new codes, lack of 
training and experience with the new 
codes, and those claims that appear to 
be deliberately miscoded in an attempt 
to defraud or abuse the payment system. 
WEDI states that, despite an initial 
expectation of increased improper 
claims, ‘‘In the longer term, it is possible 
that fraud could be reduced since ICD– 
10–CM and ICD–10–PCS are more 
specific and there are fewer ‘gray’ areas 
in the coding.’’ 42 The amount of 
improper claims due to abuse is 
estimated to be $3.03 billion annually, 
approximately 20 percent of the $15.8 
billion that GAO estimates are 
improperly paid each year.43 GAO 
acknowledges that this number may not 
represent all improper payments. Given 
this, we assume that eight percent of 
payment system abuse is perpetrated by 
people who capitalize on the ambiguity 
of the ICD–9–CM codes.44 We also 
assume that half of that eight percent 
would feel that the new codes would 
eliminate the ambiguity, eliminating 
half of these abuses, assuming that new 
ambiguities are not created. 
We estimate that after phased-in 
benefits in the first four years after 
implementation, which compounded 
annually by an 0.8 percent population 
growth factor, 100 percent of the benefit 
will be reached in the fifth year after 
implementation. We assume an 
extended phase-in for this benefit 
because of the lag time in receiving 
claims data showing the effects of the 
new system that would lead to delays in 
taking advantage of the improved and 
more precise data. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate that the benefit of fewer

46 This is an absolute value concept which 
applies to both procedures done and not done.

49 Based on research that Viscoosy and others 
have done on the value of a statistical value of life, 
$50,000 for a year of full quality of life appears to 
be conservative. We have updated the estimated a 
statistical life year based on inflation since RAND 
examined the issue based on the value that HHS has 
used in a number of regulations.

51 This is different from RAND’s parameter of 0.1, 
but was confirmed through discussions with the 
authors. 
improper claims will equal 
approximately $508.22 million, with a 
range minimum estimate of $121 
million and a maximum estimate of 
$1,455 million. 
As with rejected claims, this benefit is 
also expected to be an initial cost as 
people take advantage of the ambiguity 
during transition to ICD–10 code sets. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
there may be a greater number of 
returned claims as well as an increase 
in the percentage of initial improper 
payments. In Table 13a, we show the 
expected effects of the initial impact of 
rejected and improper claims. We invite 
the public to comment on our 
assumptions and to provide any data 
that may improve the accuracy of our 
analysis. 
d. Better Understanding of New 
Procedures 45 
Benefits are also anticipated due to 
better understanding of new procedures 
with ICD–10. The rationale is that ICD– 
10’s granularity would aid statistical 
analysis and provide more information 
on disease treatments and outcomes. We 
estimate the number of procedures that 
would be identified only in ICD–10– 
PCS and would provide statistically 
significant differences in outcomes. 
That is, identification of procedures 
through the use of the ICD–10 codes 
could presumably enable statistical 
analysis of procedures that would not 
otherwise be possible and thereby 
become the subject of research. Through 
a series of assumptions regarding 
200,000 occurrences of the ‘‘significant’’ 
new procedures that would be added 
each year (see the discussion above 
regarding more accurate payment for 
new procedures), we pare the number of 
procedures that would actually be 
changed as a result of research down to 
16,000 procedures.46 The assumptions 
apply to the elimination of high volume 
procedures (again, see the discussion on 
more accurate payment for new 
procedures), the probability that 
anomalies would be discovered only 
through the application of ICD–10 codes 
and that finally such anomalies would 
result in the change in medical practice. 
The results of the research could 
indicate that procedures that were 
considered appropriate are now found 
to be inappropriate for the patients that 
underwent the procedure. Similarly, the 
research may find that procedures that 
were believed to be inappropriate may 
now be thought to be appropriate. 
Finally, applying the same net 
benefits used in the analysis of more 
accurate payments of new procedures, 
we conclude after phased-in benefits in 
the first three years following 
implementation, which compounded 
annually by an 0.8 percent growth in the 
population, 100 percent of the benefit 
will be realized in the fourth year. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we estimate that the benefit of a better 
understanding of new procedures with 
implementing ICD–10, would equal 
approximately $812.54 million with a 
minimum range estimate of $121 
million and a maximum estimate of 
$1,819 million. We invite the public to 
comment on our assumptions and to 
provide any data that may improve the 
accuracy of our analysis. 
e. Improved Disease Management 47 
Disease management programs are 
generally used for managing chronic 
diseases to prevent or delay serious 
complications. The increased 
granularity of ICD–10–CM would allow 
case management organizations to better 
identify candidates for disease 
management programs, and to better 
adapt the disease management program 
to the individual once enrolled. To 
estimate improvements in disease 
management that the ICD–10 conversion 
could bring about, we follow RAND’s 
use of diabetes as the sample disease 
and their assumption that two-thirds of 
all the benefit would come from better 
management of this disease. 
For purposes of this analysis we 
follow the RAND model that divides 
diabetics into Type I and Type II not 
currently in a disease management plan 
and who could benefit from 
participating in such a plan; and those 
in a disease management plan and who 
could benefit from improved 
management of their disease. RAND 
makes the following assumptions: 
• 60 percent of diabetics are currently 
enrolled in plans with disease 
management programs; 
• 50 percent of the patients in such 
plans are not in a disease management 
program (30 percent); 
• 50 percent of plans use a system 
other than ICD to identify and classify 
their patients. Of the remaining half, 
2/3 use (1/3 of the total) use ICD 
classifications; 
• Use of ICD–10 reveals new 
information on 20 percent of Type II 
diabetics in plans using ICD 
classifications; 
• 50 percent of these patients elect to 
participate in the disease management 
program; 
• 20 percent of those newly enrolled 
in a disease management program, 
achieve sufficient improvement to 
increase their life expectancy by six 
months. 
• For patients already in a disease 
management program, using ICD–10 
will result in an improved program in 
50 percent of the patients. 
• 10 percent of Type I and Type II 
will achieve improvements to the point 
of Type I achieving two additional years 
of full quality life and Type II six 
additional months of full quality life. 
We estimate the number of both Type 
I and Type II diabetics at 1.2 million 
and 22.8 million,48 respectively. Using 
these numbers as a base, we can arrive 
at an annual estimate of benefits. 
Applying RAND’s formulas in this case, 
we determine that approximately 45,144 
Type II individuals per year who would 
gain six months of full quality of life 
valued at $100,000 per year.49 This 
yields a benefit of $2.257 billion 
($50,000 × 45,144) for those Type II 
diabetics not currently enrolled in a 
disease management plan but who 
would be enrolled as a result of the 
conversion to the ICD–10 codes.50 
The benefit of the greater granularity 
that use of ICD–10 codes may offer for 
those who are currently enrolled in a 
disease management plan is greatly 
dependent upon how much the 
additional detail helps the enrollee, and 
how many enrollees are helped. We 
could create an assumption for the 
percentage of people who would be 
enrolled in a better plan based on the 
new information that ICD–10 codes may 
provide, and the percentage of those 
whose treatment would be adjusted in 
response to the new information.51 
We could potentially conclude that 
adding someone to a diabetes 
management program has twice the 
benefit of adjusting treatment for 
someone already enrolled in a disease 
management program. As a result of the 
code conversion, it is possible that, for 
example, 1,188 individuals with Type I 
diabetes would gain 2 years of life while 
22,572 individuals with Type II diabetes

49824 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 164 / Friday, August 22, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
would gain 6 months of full quality life. 
We attribute the difference in longevity 
to the fact that Type I diabetes usually 
manifests itself in younger persons. 
Changes made earlier in a person’s life 
will have a longer deterioration curve by 
about two years than changes made later 
in a person’s life. 
When we combine the parameters, we 
could realize an annual benefit of 
$237.6 million for Type I diabetes and 
$1.1286 billion for Type II diabetes 
already in a plan for a total of $1.3662 
billion. We could potentially show an 
annual benefit for better management of 
diabetes to be $3.6234 billion ($2.2572 
billion from new Type II patients 
enrolled in disease management + 
$1.3662 billion from improved disease 
management of Type I and Type II 
patients already in a plan). 
Finally, we could share RAND’s 
assumption that the diabetes benefit is 
about two-thirds of the total benefit for 
improved case management attributable 
to converting to ICD–10. Under RAND’s 
assumption the total annual benefit for 
improved disease management would 
be $5.4351 billion. We assume a phase- 
in of benefits prior to the fourth year of 
implementation where 100 percent of 
the benefit is realized in the fourth year 
after implementation. 
The aforementioned scenario is based 
upon our interpretation of RAND’s 
scenario that the benefit of improved 
disease management could conceivably 
be expected from ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10 PCS code sets applied to the sample 
disease, diabetes. However, although we 
agree that the potential benefits of 
disease management could be large, we 
do not necessarily agree with the 
calculations used in RAND’s theory 
because we believe they assume much 
greater benefits than can be directly 
attributable to the ICD–10 code set 
alone, such as the development of new 
and improved diabetes drugs or 
improved patient outreach, monitoring 
and communications. RAND also does 
not take into account disease 
management benefits from across the 
full clinical spectrum. For purposes of 
this analysis, we very conservatively 
claim a one percent benefit of our total 
disease management calculations based 
on RAND’s formulas, and solicit 
feedback from the industry on this 
assumption. 
Therefore, for purposes of this impact 
analysis, we estimate that the total 
benefit of improved disease 
management may equal approximately 
$582.57 million with a minimum range 
estimate of $291 million and a 
maximum estimate of $1,165 million. 
f. Better Understanding of Health 
Conditions and Health Care Outcomes 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS provide 
specific diagnosis and treatment 
information that can improve quality 
measurements and patient safety, and 
the evaluation of medical processes and 
outcomes. ICD–10–PCS has the 
capability to readily expand and capture 
new procedures and technologies. For 
quality improvement programs to 
effectively result in meaningful clinical 
outcomes, improved practice 
management processes that document 
and measure patient care, and sustain 
provider investment in services that 
improve quality of care, the ability to 
modify or add to a list of treatments, 
diseases and conditions is essential. The 
ICD–10 code sets provide a standard 
coding convention that is flexible, 
providing unique codes for all 
substantially different procedures or 
health conditions and allowing new 
procedures and diagnoses to be easily 
incorporated as new codes for both 
existing and future clinical protocols. 
g. Harmonization of Disease Monitoring 
and Reporting World-Wide 
Another benefit we expect will be 
achieved with the implementation of 
the ICD–10–CM codes is better 
coordination of disease outbreak 
reporting with other countries. Most 
industrialized countries have adopted 
the ICD–10 code structure and, with the 
United State’s adoption of the codes, the 
time to identify and respond to cross- 
border disease outbreaks will be 
reduced. We will be able to process 
public health warnings coming from 
other countries faster and be able to 
respond more accurately to the threats 
because of the greater precision of the 
coding compared to ICD–9. 
Below is a chart that illustrates the 
reduction in response time we expect to 
achieve from the implementation of 
ICD–10–CM codes. After the outbreak of 
an illness occurs, as represented by the 
large curve on the left of the chart, there 
is a reporting lag and a further delay for 
the processing and analyzing of reports 
and the mounting of a response. The 
sooner outbreaks are reported to public 
health officials and the more accurate 
the information that is reported, the 
faster officials can respond. The two 
smaller curves on the right side of the 
chart represent the time between 
outbreak and response under the current 
coding and the enhanced response time. 
The shift to the left of the response time 
represents the benefit in terms of the 
short response time and outbreak. 
The following chart was originally 
published in an FDA rule, 
‘‘Establishment and Maintenance of 
Records under the Public Health 
Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness 
and Response Act of 2002.’’ It was 
published in the Federal Register on 
December 9, 2004 (Vol. 69, No. 236; 
Rules and Regulations 71615) and was 
adapted for use in this regulation.

52 ‘‘The Effectiveness of ICD–10–CM in Capturing 
Public Health Diseases.’’ AHIMA, Perspectives in 
Health Information Management 2007 (June 12, 
2007), http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/ 
public/documents/ahima/bok1_036019.html, 
accessed 8–12–08. 
These benefits would expand 
communication and interoperability 
capabilities for biosurveillance and 
disease reporting at an international 
level. As noted in a recent report, The 
Effectiveness of ICD–10–CM in 
Capturing Public Health Diseases, 
‘‘* * * the use of ICD–10–CM has great 
implications for our entire nation since 
public health diseases, which include 
epidemic and other diseases related to 
bioterrorism, are generally able to be 
captured in a more specific way when 
using the ICD–10–CM system.’’ 52 
BioSense, CDC’s early event detection 
system, currently uses ICD–9–CM. 
Improved clinical detail would be a 
benefit to a national system designed to 
improve the nation’s capabilities for 
disease detection, monitoring, and real- 
time health situational awareness. 
As noted in the May 2004 NCVHS 
Workgroup on Quality Report, titled 
‘‘Measuring Health Care Quality: 
Obstacles and Opportunities’’, most 
other industrialized nations have 
already transitioned to ICD–10, 
requiring a painstaking crosswalk of 
United States diagnosis codes to make 
international comparisons. 
However, even with a crosswalk, 
comparisons are problematic given that 
changes to ICD–10 which represent a 
new understanding of disease (such as 
the myeloproliferative disorders and 
myelodysplastic syndrome now being 
recognized as hematologic malignancies 
which are classified as neoplasms of 
uncertain behavior in ICD–9–CM) affect 
data analysis at the State, national and 
international level. 
Because the U.S. does not currently 
use ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS, there 
is insufficient data to quantify the 
results of these benefits. For additional 
discussion of biosurveillance, refer to 
section III. 
Table 12 below outlines the total 
estimated benefits as outlined in the 
above sections. The table shows both 
the minimum and maximum ranges for 
each benefit as well as their 
corresponding primary estimates.

C. Alternatives Considered 
As discussed in detail in section VII 
of the preamble of this proposed rule, 
we considered a number of options for 
replacing ICD–9. We considered 
extending the life of ICD–9–CM by 
utilizing unassigned codes, use of CPT– 
4 for coding inpatient hospital 
procedures, and waiting to adopt ICD– 
11 as alternatives to the adoption of 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. We 
determined that adopting ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS was the only viable 
alternative that would meet the long- 
term coding needs of the health care 
industry. 
1. Relation to and Impact on Other HIT 
Initiatives 
Both Federal and private-sector 
stakeholders prefer synchronization of 
related Federal HIT initiatives to permit 
adequate planning, resources, and 
implementation. Because 
implementation of ICD–10 is a massive 
undertaking, these initiatives should be 
queued up as rationally as possible. 
Most of the initiatives related to the 
adoption of ICD–10 involve 
promulgation of regulations and 
compliance dates. In this respect, there 
is minimal flexibility when some 
regulations may be promulgated and 
related compliance dates. Under 
sections 1860D–4(e)(1), 1860D–4(e)(3) 
and 1860D–4(e)(4)(D) of the Act, we 
were required to promulgate uniform 
standards for e-prescribing not later 
than April 1, 2008. Not later than one 
year after promulgation of such final 
standards, prescriptions and other 
prescription-related information for 
drugs covered under Medicare Part D 
and for individuals eligible for Part D 
benefits must be transmitted only in 
accordance with such standards. We 
anticipate that most of this regulatory 
activity will take place in 2008. At the 
same time, there are a number of related 
Departmental and private sector 
initiatives that will be ongoing during 
this time period, although specific dates 
are not available at this time. During the 
next several years, for instance, we 
anticipate that the Certification 
Commission for Healthcare Information 
Technology (CCHIT) will be completing 
and updating certification criteria for 
ambulatory EHRs, inpatient EHRs, and 
health information networks. CCHIT has 
already developed certification criteria 
for ambulatory EHRs and inpatient 
EHRs and has already begun certifying 
both types of products. CCHIT has also 
begun developing certification criteria 
for networks. Once CCHIT has 
established the certification criteria, it 
plans to update them on a yearly basis 
to align its efforts with the standards 
harmonization efforts of the Healthcare 
Information Technology Standards 
Panel (HITSP). 
HITSP seeks to achieve widely 
accepted and readily implemented 
consensus-based standards that will 
enable and support widespread 
interoperability among health care 
information technology users, especially 
as they would interact in a Nationwide 
Health Information Network (NHIN) for 
the United States. On October 31, 2006, 
HITSP presented three sets of 
‘‘interoperability specifications’’ to the 
American Health Information 
Community (AHIC), a Federal advisory 
committee chartered to make 
recommendations to the Secretary on 
methods for accelerating the 
development and adoption of health 
information technology. The AHIC 
considered HITSP’s presentation, and 
after reaching consensus, recommended 
to the Secretary that he recognize 
certain interoperability specifications. 
On March 1, 2007, the Department 
published a Notice of Availability (72 
FR 9339), identifying the recommended 
specifications, and indicating the 
Secretary’s acceptance and anticipated 
recognition of the interoperability 
specifications. In January 2008, 
following a one-year period of 
implementation testing, the Secretary 
announced his formal recognition of 
HITSP interoperability specifications 
(http://www.hitsp.org/government.aspx, 
accessed 8–12–08.) 
Both CCHIT and HITSP have 
developed processes that build industry 
consensus and support voluntary 
adoption of health information 
technology standards. By ‘‘recognizing’’ 
interoperability standards, the Secretary 
is also advancing the adoption of health 
IT standards within the Federal 
government and among many of its 
contractors (See Executive Order 
13410—Promoting Quality and Efficient 
Health Care in Federal Government 
Administered or Sponsored Health Care 
Programs), and for certain entities 
seeking to donate EHR software and 
training services in compliance with the 
Stark EHR Exception and the Anti- 
Kickback EHR Safe Harbor (See 71 FR 
45140 and 71 FR 45110). Finally, trial 
implementations of the Nationwide 
Health Information Network (NHIN), 
including specifications and testing of 
interoperable health information 
exchange, are proceeding. 
The implementation of ICD–10 will 
promote the use of HIT and increase the 
overall value of EHRs. Updating a 
coding system to a more rigorous and 
exact coding system such as ICD–10 
results in the ability to more accurately 
understand changes in medical 
technology, treatment patterns, disease 
spread, and outcomes of quality 
measures. The detail and precision of 
the ICD–10 codes will allow for any 
necessary updates to quality measures, 
payment systems, fraud prevention and 
clinical decision support mechanisms. 
ICD–10 is already included in the 
HITSP electronic health record (EHR) 
use case, and as an administrative 
standard it will drive change as it will 
be required for use on all claims. 
ICD–10 impacts on HIT initiatives 
might come in the form of the industry 
needing time to become comfortable 
with the new codes, resulting in benefits 
being reaped 1–2 years after 
implementation. While there will be 
resource impacts on other HIT 
initiatives as a result of the ICD–10 
implementation, there will be greater 
impacts if ICD–10 is delayed and more 
EHR systems need to be retrofitted. 
CMS solicits industry and stakeholder 
comments on the direct and indirect 
impacts to current Health Information 
Technology initiatives. 
Tables 13a and b below outline the 
total estimated benefits and costs as 
outlined in the above sections. The table 
illustrates in which years we believe 
each cost and benefit will be realized.

D. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
of 1980, Public Law 96–354, requires 
that the Secretary certify that a proposed 
regulation will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. In the health 
care sector, a small entity is one with 
between $6.5 million and $31.5 million 
in annual revenues or is a nonprofit 
organization. For the purposes of this 
analysis (pursuant to the RFA), 
nonprofit organizations are considered 
small entities; however, individuals and 
States are not included in the definition 
of a small entity. We have attempted to 
estimate the number of small entities 
and provide a general discussion of the 
effects of the proposed regulation. 
Because most medical providers are 
either nonprofit or meet the SBA’s size 
standard for small business, we treat all 
medical providers as small entities. 
1. Alternatives Considered 
As mentioned in section VII of the 
proposed rule, we considered various 
policy alternatives to adopting ICD–10– 
CM and ICD–10–PCS. One alternative 
that was considered included the use of 
unassigned codes. Although it may be 
possible to extend the life of ICD–9–CM 
by assigning codes to new diagnoses 
and procedures without regard to the 
hierarchy of the code set, it does not 
represent a long-term solution and will 
only be effective as long as there are 
empty code slots. Moreover, it does not 
address the remaining shortcomings of 
ICD–9–CM such as the critical lack of 
detail that is required to support 
evolving business needs and advanced 
technology. 
Another alternative that was 
considered included the use of CPT–4 
for coding hospital inpatient 
procedures. Both the National 
Committee on Vital and Health 
Statistics (NCVHS) and GAO found 
structural problems and serious flaws 
with CPT–4 for coding inpatient 
hospital procedures since the system 
could not capture all services in all 
health care settings. 
A final alternative that was 
considered was waiting and adopting 
ICD–11, which is not a feasible option 
since the WHO is in their earliest stages 
of development with the earliest 
projection of the completion being 2016. 
However, based on past experience with 
the development of ICD–10 being 
several years late, it is anticipated that 
this date will slip. The U.S version 
would then need to be developed 
requiring additional analysis, which 
could take a minimum of 3–5 years 
(optimistically). It is not expected that 
ICD–11 will be available for use in the 
U.S. until at least 2020. 
We considered a number of options 
for implementing the transition to ICD– 
10 but rejected them as being too costly 
and too burdensome. One of the options 
we considered included phasing in the 
implementation of the new codes either 
by geographic region as Canada and 
Australia did, or by provider/supplier 
category. We rejected these alternatives 
because it would require plans, 
especially national plans and possibly

plans would have to learn the new ICD– 
10 codes at the same time work with the 
old ICD–9 codes, which would increase 
the chance of errors in payments, create 
confusion and uncertainty in the 
providers/supplier community and 
result in delays in processing claims. 
We believe the cost of maintaining two 
systems running concurrently would 
impose a very significant burden on 
plans and providers/suppliers. 
Another option for implementing the 
transition to the new coding system is 
to maintain both the ICD–9 and ICD–10 
systems for a period of time. We rejected 
this alternative for many of the same 
reasons we rejected phasing in the ICD– 
10 code sets. Maintaining two systems 
imposes a significant burden on payers 
and providers/suppliers as well as 
creates conditions for increased coding 
errors and payment delays. In addition, 
because Medicare updates the ICD codes 
on October 1 of each year, 
implementation of any new codes must 
take place on that date. Given the risks 
for error and the added costs, there 
seems to be little benefit to be gained 
from providing the opportunity for 
parallel coding systems beyond the 
October 1 deadline being proposed in 
this rule. 
A third option that was considered 
and rejected was to delay 
implementation for small entities. 
However, because we treat all heath care 
providers/suppliers as small entities, we 
did not see any benefit to be gained 
from delaying implementation of the 
ICD–10 code sets beyond the four-year 
implementation period being proposed 
in the rule. Delaying implementation 
would only have an adverse effect on 
implementation of other standards that 
use the ICD codes. Those standards and 
the systems built around those 
standards would either have to be 
pushed off further into the future or 
have to be revised and redesigned to 
accommodate the ICD–10 code sets. The 
costs of such delays could be 
substantial. Therefore we rejected this 
option for ICD–10 implementation. 
2. Number of Small Entities 
Two hundred nonprofit health care 
organizations that offer 213 plans are 
considered small entities because of 
their nonprofit status. Practices of 
doctors of osteopathy, podiatry, 
chiropractors, mental health 
independent practitioners with annual 
receipts of less than $6.5 million are 
considered to be small entities. Solo and 
group physicians’ offices with annual 
receipts of less than $9 million (97 
percent of all physician practices) are 
also considered small entities, as are 
clinics. Approximately 92 percent of 
medical laboratories, 100 percent of 
dental laboratories and 90 percent of 
durable medical equipment suppliers 
are assumed to be small entities as well. 
The American Medical Billing 
Association (AMBA) (http:// 
www.ambanet.net/AMBA.htm, accessed 
8–12–08) lists 97 billing companies on 
its Web site. It notes that these are the 
only companies with Web sites. The 
Statistics of U.S. Businesses data shows 
that there are 97,556 firms involved in 
system design and related services 
(NAICS code 5415) providing software 
services, data processors, computer 
facilities management services, 
computer system design services, 
custom programming services as well as 
other computer-related services. 
Table 9 above (see section XI.B.6.d) 
presents the impact of the ICD–10 
implementation costs on all entities we 
anticipate will be affected by the rule. 
Because we consider all health care 
provider-suppliers as small entities, 
Table 9 shows that the proposed rule 
will not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small health care 
entities. The following table (Table 15) 
summarizes the results from Table 9 for 
inpatient and outpatient providers/ 
suppliers.

To determine the impact on small 
insurance carriers, third party 
administrators and system design and 
related services firms, we first 
determined the number of entities that 
meet the SBA size standard. For 
insurance carriers and third party 
administrators, the SBA size standard is 
annual receipts of $6.5 million. For 
system design and related services 
firms, the SBA size standard is annual 
receipts of $23 million. 
Using the Statistics for U.S. 
Businesses for firm sizes by number of 
employees for 2005 (the latest year for 
which the Census Bureau reports 
payroll), we combined total annual 
payroll reported for NAICS 524114 and 
524292 for a total of $32.5 billion 
(http://www.census.gov/epcd/susb/
2005/us/US—.HTM, accessed 8–21–08) 
Taking the total premium payments 
made to health insurers reported for 
2006 (the latest year for which CMS has 
insurance premium data) in the 
National Health Expenditure Report of 
$723.4 billion (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
NationalHealthExpendData/
02_NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.
asp, accessed 8–12–08), we divided 
total insurance premiums by total 
payroll to arrive at a ratio of annual 
health insurance receipts to annual 
payroll of 22.3. 
Applying the ratio to the reported 
annual payroll for the employee size 
categories and dividing by the number 
of firms in each category, we found that 
firms with between 10 and 19 
employees had average annual receipts 
of $8.3 million. 
Based on the method for computing 
annual receipts for firms by the number 
of employees, we estimate that 71 
percent of insurers and third party 
administrators account for 2.5 percent of 
annual receipts. Applying this percent 
to the projected costs of system changes 
for payers found in Table 13a, the costs 
to small insurers and third party 
administrators is expected to be a total 
of $4 million for the anticipated four- 
year implementation period. Thus, the 
annual cost is expected to be 
approximately $1 million or 0.01 
percent of revenues. 
We applied the same approach for 
system design and related computer 
services firms and used 2006 receipt 
data from the Statistics of U.S. 
Businesses Annual Survey for NAICS 
5415 in place of the National Health 
Expenditure data, http:// 
www.census.gov/svsd/www/services/
sas/sas_data/sas54.htm, accessed 8–12– 
08). Dividing total annual receipts by 
total annual payroll, we applied a ratio 
of 2.4468 to the annual payrolls of the 
various employee size categories and

found that firms with between 100 and 
499 employees had average annual 
receipts of $27.7 million. Total annual 
receipts for all small entities equal $107 
billion which represents 53.3 percent of 
total annual receipts for the NAICS 
category. By comparison, the number of 
small entities represents 99.3 percent of 
all firms in this category. 
Taking the small entity receipt ratio to 
total receipts and applying it to the 
expected ICD–10 implementation costs, 
we find that the cost to small entities 
equals $51.5 million over the four year 
implementation period or $12.9 million 
per year. As a percent of receipts, this 
equals 0.1 percent. 
As we pointed out in discussing the 
effects of the total costs on third party 
administrators and system design 
computer firms, we do not know how 
many firms will actually be involved in 
implementing the ICD–10 coding 
system. For purposes of the analysis, we 
assume that all firms reported in the 
Statistics of U.S. Businesses for the 
NAICS codes we are examining will be 
participating in the implementation of 
the codes. Since it is possible we could 
be including more firms than will be 
implementing the codes, our impact 
estimate on small entities may be 
understated. To test the sensitivity of 
the impact of the implementation costs 
on small firms, we assumed that burden 
would equal three percent of revenues. 
HHS policy states that if a rule imposes 
a burden equal to or greater than three 
percent of a firm’s revenues, it is 
significant (see: ‘‘Guidance on Proper 
Consideration of Small Entities in 
Rulemakings of the U. S. Department of 
Health and Human Services’’ at http:// 
www.hhs.gov/execsec/smallbus.html, 
accessed 8–12–08). We assumed that the 
small business share of the market 
would remain constant at 53 percent 
and that the $12.8 million costs we 
expect small firms to incur will be 
distributed equally. Using these 
assumptions, we computed the amount 
of small entity revenue such that the 
ICD–10 small entity share would equal 
three percent—$429 million. We then 
calculated the percent of $429 million 
that is the small entity share of the 
revenue and multiplied the results by 
the number of small entities (see Table 
16). From this analysis we estimate that 
if only 389 or fewer small firms provide 
computer and software services, the 
burden could be significant. 
We note that the regulation would not 
impose any compliance requirements on 
system design and related services firms 
and, while the firms may have to wait 
for some period of time before they are 
compensated for their services because 
of contract agreements, they should 
eventually be able to pass on some or all 
of their costs on to their customers. In 
order to determine if these estimates are 
accurate, we are specifically requesting 
comments on our analysis and asking 
for any data that will help us determine 
the number and sizes of firms 
implementing the ICD–10 code sets. 
Table 16 below summarizes the 
impact of the rule on small insurance 
carriers, third party administrators, and 
system design and related computer 
design firms.

It is evident that the conversion to 
ICD–10 would have a wide-ranging 
impact, affecting almost every health 
entity. At minimum, personnel will 
have to adjust to the new diagnostic 
codes when submitting bills. For a small 
enterprise that does business in a 
relatively narrow range of services or 
supplies relies primarily on paper 
records, the change may be minimal 
involving no more than a software 
upgrade for its billing system and new 
super bill forms. Based on a survey 
published in the June 18, 2008 New 
England Journal of Medicine (Catherine 
M. DesRoches, Eric G. Campbell, 
Sowmya R. Rao, et al.) found that 83 
percent of doctors did not have 
electronic records systems (N Engl J 
Med 2008;359:50–60). Thus, we expect 
that the vast majority of physicians and 
practitioners will need to make 
relatively small changes in their record 
billing systems. 
In the same survey the authors found 
that only 4 percent of physicians 
surveyed had fully functional electronic 
health records systems and 13 percent 
had a basic electronic health records 
system. Of the physicians with fully 
functioning electronic health records, 28 
percent belong to group practices with 
six or more physicians. Nine percent of 
physicians with access to electronic 
health record systems practice in 
hospitals, clinics, and medical centers. 
Although the cost to transition to the 
ICD–10-CM codes will be more costly 
for providers/suppliers with electronic 
health records systems, the data 
suggests that large practices and 
hospitals and medical centers have 
invested in the sophisticated record 
systems rather than the average medical 
practice. 
Based upon the previously cited 
survey, we assume that in many small 
provider practices, electronic health 
record systems likely are not used. 
Some may use practice management 
systems (most likely for billing 
purposes) and these will need to be 
updated. However, the costs for these 
updates can be attributed to the 
implementation of Version 5010, and 
not to ICD–10. Very small provider 
practices without practice management 
systems likely use only paper. In these 
instances, there will be minimal costs, 
such as revision to their paper records 
and the updating of their printed super 
bills. We invite industry and 
stakeholder comment regarding these 
assumptions. 
At the other extreme are large 
teaching hospitals and health plans that 
will not only have to transition to the 
new diagnostic codes, but also to the 
new procedure codes. The changes 
entailed for such large organizations 
may involve the reconfiguration of 
entire data systems that will require

hundreds of staff hours in addition to 
training time and lost productivity. 
Although the previous analysis 
indicates that the overall impact on the 
health care sector of the economy will 
be very small, we acknowledge that 
these entities may incur a significant 
economic impact. However, we believe 
these organizations comprise a small 
minority of the total number of health 
care entities. We solicit industry and 
stakeholder input on this issue. 
To further illustrate the impact we 
anticipate the rule will have, we 
developed a scenario for a typical 
community hospital in the Mid-West. 
The data for this illustration is drawn 
from the American Hospital Directory 
(http://www.AHD.com). While based on 
an actual hospital in a mid-western 
state, the data has been altered to make 
calculations simpler. The hospital has 
100 beds, 4,000 discharges annually, 
and gross revenues of $200 million. 
Using the factors presented in the 
impact analysis, we estimated training 
costs (including the cost of the actual 
training as well as lost time away from 
the job), productivity loss for the first 6 
months resulting from becoming 
familiar with the diagnostic and 
procedure codes, and the cost of system 
changes. For our scenario, we assumed 
that the hospital employs three full-time 
coders who will require eight hours of 
training at $500 per coder for $1,500 
($500 × 3). While they are in training, 
the hospital will have to substitute other 
staff either by hiring temporary coders 
if possible or shifting staff. The 
estimated cost at $50 per hour is $1,200 
(8 hours × 3 staff × $50 per hour). 
In estimating the productivity loss, we 
are only looking at the initial 6 months 
after implementation. Therefore we 
divided the annual number of 
discharges of 4,000 by 2 to equal 2,000. 
We assume that 3/4 of the discharges are 
surgical, giving us 1,500 discharges 
requiring use of PCS codes. Dividing 
this by 6 months yields an average 
monthly discharge rate of 250. 
We perform a similar calculation for 
outpatient claims. Of the 13,000 
outpatient claims, the monthly average 
is 1,083 (we do not distinguish between 
medical and surgical outpatient claims). 
Applying the 1.7 extra minutes per 
discharge, we estimate it would take an 
e×tra 425 minutes (1.7 × 250) to code the 
discharges in the first month. At $50 per 
hour, the cost per minute is $0.83 ($50/ 
60 minutes) and the cost per claim is 
$1.41 ($0.83 × 1.7). For the first month, 
the productivity loss for inpatient 
coding is $353 ($1.41 × 250). Assuming 
for simplicity’s sake that the resumption 
of productivity over the 6-month period 
would increase in a straight line, we 
divide the $353 by six to come up with 
$59. We reduce the productivity loss by 
this amount each month through the 
sixth month. The total loss for the 6- 
month period is $1,233. 
We apply the same method to 
determine the outpatient productivity 
loss. Based on our assumption that 
outpatient claims will require one- 
hundredth of the time for hospital 
inpatient claims, we applying the .017 
extra minutes per claim, we estimate it 
would take an extra 18.41 minutes 
(0.017 × 1083) to code the discharges in 
the first month. At $50 per hour, the 
cost per minute is $0.83 ($50/60 
minutes) and the cost per claim is 
$0.014 ($0.83 × 0.017). For the first 
month, the productivity loss for 
inpatient coding is $15.28 ($0.014 × 
1083). Assuming for simplicity sake that 
the resumption of productivity over the 
6-month period would increase in a 
straight line, we divide the $15.28 by 
six; to come up with $2.55. We reduce 
the productivity loss by this amount 
each month through the sixth month. 
Thus the total loss for the first 6 months 
will equal $53. 
In estimating the cost of system 
changes and software upgrades, we 
deliberately chose a value that we think 
overstates the cost. We assumed that 
hospital will have to spend $300,000 on 
its data infrastructure to accommodate 
the new codes. Summing the training 
costs, productivity losses, and system 
upgrades, we estimate the total cost to 
the hospital will equal approximately 
$303,990. Finally, in order to determine 
the percent of the hospital’s revenue 
that would be diverted to funding the 
conversion to the ICD–10 we compared 
the estimated cost associated with the 
conversion to ICD–10 to the total 
hospital revenue of $200 million. The 
costs amount to 0.15 percent of the 
hospital’s annual revenues. 
We note that although the impact in 
our scenario of 0.15 percent is 
significantly larger than the estimated 
impact of 0.03 percent for inpatient 
facilities in the Table 15 above, it is still 
significantly below the threshold the 
Department considers a significant 
economic impact. As expressed in the 
Department guidance on conducting 
regulatory flexibility analyses, the 
threshold for an economic impact to be 
considered significant is 3 percent to 5 
percent of either receipts or costs. As is 
clear from the analysis, the impact does 
not come close to the threshold. Thus 
based on the foregoing analysis, we 
conclude that some health care 
providers or suppliers may encounter 
significant burdens in the course of 
converting to the ICD–10 codes. 
However, we are of the opinion that, for 
most providers and suppliers, payers 
and computer firms involved in 
facilitating the transition, the costs will 
be relatively small. 
3. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing analysis, we 
could certify that this proposed 
regulation would not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. However 
because of the substantial uncertainty in 
the data and our assumptions we invite 
public comments on the analysis and 
request any additional data that would 
help us determine more accurately the 
impact on the various categories of 
entities affected by the rule.

As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a–4.pdf) (accessed 8–12–08), in 
Table 12 below, we have prepared an 
accounting statement showing the 
classification of the expenditures 
associated with the provisions of this 
proposed rule. This table provides our 
best estimate of the costs and benefits 
associated with the implementation of 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS in 2011 as 
HIPAA standard code sets to replace 
ICD–9–CM. All exclassified as 
implementation for HIPAA covered

F. Conclusion 
Because ICD–9 is the official system 
of assigning codes to medical diagnoses 
and procedures associated with hospital 
and ambulatory utilization, the 
changeover to ICD–10 codes will have a 
major impact on the entire health care 
industry. This transition is needed due 
to the space and granularity deficiencies 
inherent in the almost three-decade-old 
ICD–9 code set, and the increased 
procedure and diagnosis detail that 
ICD–10 offers, allowing for more 
accurate payment of claims. 
For hospitals, ambulatory centers, 
physician offices, and health plans, this 
transition will be multifaceted, but once 
adopted, ICD–10 would allow for better 
coding of complex conditions and 
procedures as well as a more uniform 
measure of reimbursement. Providers 
and payers are likely to need a cross- 
walk of ICD–9 codes to ICD–10 codes in 
the beginning of the transition, but as 
our analysis has shown, in the long- 
term, the benefits of ICD–10 outweigh 
its costs. 
This impact analysis references two 
reports that outline the costs and 
benefits of transitioning from ICD–9 to 
ICD–10. These reports include ‘‘The 
Costs and Benefits of Moving to the 
ICD–10 Code Sets’’ by the RAND 
Corporation, and ‘‘Replacing ICD–9–CM 
with ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
Challenges, Estimated Costs, and 
Potential Benefits’’ by the Robert E. 
Nolan Company. For purposes of this 
impact analysis, we also reference field 
studies and interviews done by AHIMA, 
which detail first-hand accounts of the 
benefits of using the ICD–10 code sets. 
If we do not implement ICD–10 codes, 
we could continue to use ICD–9 codes; 
however, as mentioned in previous 
sections of this impact analysis, ICD–9 
codes do not capture new 
technologically-advanced procedures, 
there would be an increased need to add 
new codes in illogical locations which 
would cause more confusion and 
inaccuracy when assigning codes, and 
there would possibly be improper 
payments for inaccurate diagnoses and 
procedures. 
Because of the considerable 
uncertainty in the data and our 
assumptions we invite public comments 
regarding whether this proposed 
regulation would have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. We request 
any additional data that would help us 
determine more accurately the impact 
on the various categories of entities 
affected by the rule. 
We have considered the alternatives 
specified in section XI of the preamble 
of this proposed rule. We welcome 
comments on ways to lessen any 
burdens from our proposal, on 
alternatives that might be more effective 
or less costly, and/or any other 
improvements we can make before 
issuing a final rule.
