EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
This assessment examines the costs and benefits of improving the fuel economy of passenger 
cars and light trucks for model years (MY) 2011- 2015.  It includes a discussion of the 
technologies that can improve fuel economy, analysis of the potential impact on retail prices, 
safety, lifetime fuel savings and their value to consumers, and other societal benefits such as 
improved energy security and reduced emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases1.   
 
In the previous rulemaking, the agency reformed the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) 
standards for light trucks with a size-based standard based on footprint2.  This rulemaking 
continues this approach for both passenger cars and light trucks.  A continuous mathematical 
function provides a separate fuel economy target for each footprint.  Different parameters for the 
continuous mathematical function are derived for each model year.  Individual manufacturers 
will be required to comply with a single fuel economy level that is based on the distribution of its 
production among the footprints of its vehicles in each particular model year.  Although the same 
reformed CAFE scheme is proposed for both passenger cars and light trucks, they are established 
with different continuous mathematical functions specific to their design capabilities.    
 
The agency is proposing the “Optimized (7%)” alternative.  In this alternative the agency uses a 
7 percent discount rate to value benefits and sets the proposed mpg levels where marginal costs 
equal marginal benefits.  It is one of six alternatives examined in the analysis.  We also examined 
a second optimized scenario when discounting benefits at 3 percent “Optimized (3%).  In general 
order of increasing severity (see Table 1), the seven scenarios examined are: 
 
1:  “25% Below Optimized”:   This alternative mirrors the absolute difference in mpg derived 
from the 25% Above Optimized scenario in going the same mpg amount below the Optimized 
7% alternative  
2:  “Optimized (7%) An increase in the standard based upon availability of technologies and a 
marginal cost/benefit analysis, as was used in setting the MY 2008-2011 light truck standard.  
The mpg levels are set using a 7 percent discount rate for benefits.   
3:  “25% Above Optimized”:   This alternative looks at the mpg levels of the Optimized (7%) 
and the Total Cost Equals Total Benefit alternative and picks mpg levels that are 25 percent of 
that difference.   
                                                 
1  This analysis does not contain NHTSA’s assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed 
standards and reasonable alternatives for purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 
4321-4347.  On March 28, 2008, NHTSA published a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement 
(EIS) and opened the NEPA scoping process (73 FR 16615).  NHTSA will consider the potential environmental 
impacts of the proposed standards and reasonable alternatives through the NEPA process, and NHTSA’s NEPA 
analysis will inform any further action on the proposed standards, consistent with NEPA and EPCA. 
2  Vehicle Footprint is defined as the wheelbase (the distance from the center of the front axle to the center of the 
rear axle) times the average track width (the distance between the centerline of the tires) of the vehicle (in square 
feet).  
  
ii
4:  “50% Above Optimized”:   This alternative looks at the mpg levels of the Optimized (7%) 
and the Total Cost Equals Total Benefit alternative and picks mpg levels that are 50 percent of 
that difference.   
5:  “Optimized (3%) An increase in the standard based upon availability of technologies and a 
marginal cost/benefit analysis, as was used in setting the MY 2008-2011 light truck standard, 
except that the mpg levels are set using a 3 percent discount rate for benefits.   
6:  “Total Costs Equal Total Benefits”:  An increase in the standard to a point where essentially 
total costs of the technologies added equals total benefits.  In this analysis, for brevity, at times it 
is labeled “TC = TB”.    
7:  “Technology Exhaustion”:  An increase in the standard based upon the maximum usage 
(based on NHTSA’s perspective) of available technologies, disregarding the cost impacts.     
  
Table 1a shows the agency’s projection of the actual harmonic average that would be achieved 
by the manufacturers, assuming those manufacturers whose plans are above the requirements 
would achieve those higher levels.  Table 1b shows the estimated required levels.  All of the 
tables in this analysis compare an adjusted baseline to the achieved harmonic average in Table 
1a.   
    
Costs:  Costs were estimated based on the specific technologies that were applied to improve 
each manufacturer’s fuel economy up to the level required under each alternative.  Table 2  
provides those cost estimates on an average per-vehicle basis, and Table 3 provides those 
estimates on a fleet-wide basis in millions of dollars.  Costs are not discounted. 
 
Benefits:  Benefits are determined mainly from fuel savings over the lifetime of the vehicle, but 
also include externalities such as reductions in criteria pollutants.  Table 4 provides those 
estimates on an industry-wide basis.   
 
Net Benefits:  Table 5 compares costs and benefits of each alternative.   The values in Table 5 
compare societal benefits to societal costs of each alternative.  Thus, it does not use the values of 
Table 2, which include fines paid by manufacturers and transferred to consumers to pay.     
 
Fuel Savings:  Table 6 shows the lifetime fuel savings in millions of gallons.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of changes in the fuel economy standards for 
passenger cars and for light trucks from MY 2011 to MY 2015.  It includes a discussion of the 
technologies that can improve fuel economy, the potential impacts on retail prices, safety, the 
discounted lifetime net benefits of fuel savings, and the potential gallons of fuel saved.   
 
The agency issued a final rule on April 7, 2003 (68 FR 16868), setting the CAFE standard 
applicable to light trucks for MY 2005 at 21.0 mpg, for MY 2006 at 21.6 mpg, and for MY 2007 
at 22.2 mpg.  On April 6, 2006 (71 FR 17566), the agency issued a final rule for MYs 2008 to 
2011 under a new “CAFE Reform” structure.  Similar to this report, a Final Regulatory Impact 
Analysis accompanied that final rule.4  Much of the technical and cost information used in the 
2006 analysis was taken from the findings in the National Academy of Sciences study5 published 
in January 2002.   
 
The new attribute-based Reformed CAFE system is based on the vehicle footprint (wheel base6 x 
average wheel track width7).  The anticipated advantages of the new reformed CAFE system are:       
 
First, the energy-saving potential of the CAFE program was hampered by the original regulatory 
structure.  Manufacturers who offer predominately small vehicles had little or no regulatory 
incentive to enhance fuel economy, because their vehicles tend to be more fuel efficient than the 
CAFE level.  Moreover, the difference between the fuel economy standards for passenger cars 
and light trucks (27.5 mpg and 20.7 mpg, respectively, for MY 2004) encouraged vehicle 
manufacturers to offer vehicles classified as light trucks for purposes of CAFE, possibly 
inducing design changes that hurt overall fuel economy.  A CAFE system that more closely links 
fuel economy standards to the various market segments and their fuel economy performance may 
reduce the incentive to design vehicles which are functionally similar to passenger cars but are 
classified as light trucks.    
 
Second, we were concerned that the original light truck CAFE standards could create safety 
risks.  Vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to achieve greater fuel economy by downsizing and 
downweighting.  Alternatively, manufacturers may offer small vehicles to offset their offerings 
of large vehicles.  The resulting increase in the disparity between the smallest and largest vehicle 
sizes and weights in the on-road vehicle fleet is widely believed to have increased the number of 
fatalities in crashes involving passenger cars and light-duty trucks.  The National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS) report and a NHTSA study8 have suggested that if downweighting were 
concentrated on the heaviest vehicles in the fleet, there could be a small fleetwide safety benefit, 
but downweighting of passenger cars and the lighter light trucks would increase fatalities.

A third reason for considering CAFE reform relates to the adverse economic impacts that may 
result from such future increases in the stringency of CAFE standards.  Rapid increases in the 
level of the CAFE standard could have substantial economic consequences on manufacturers,  
especially those full-line manufacturers with product mixes dominated by large heavier vehicles.  
For example, full-line manufacturers – especially those with substantial sales in the heavier end 
of the light truck market – may generate fewer CAFE credits and incur larger compliance costs 
than vehicle manufacturers who focus their sales in the smaller, lighter end of the light truck 
market.  As CAFE standards become more stringent under the original structure, the full-line 
manufacturers may experience adverse financial consequences, with resulting disruptions for 
employees in these firms and their suppliers.   
 
EPCA also gives NHTSA authority to set passenger car CAFE standards for each model year, 
but sets a default standard of 27.5 mpg.  NHTSA has not raised the passenger car CAFE standard 
from 27.5 mpg since Congress lifted the ban on CAFE rulemakings in 2002 because it did not 
believe that it had authority to reform passenger car CAFE as it had for light trucks.  Reforming 
the CAFE program achieves larger fuel savings while enhancing safety and preventing adverse 
economic consequences—objectives which apply equally to passenger cars as to light trucks.  
NHTSA was unwilling to raise the passenger car CAFE standard without also reforming it, 
because of the same fuel savings, safety, and economic concerns that led it to reform the light 
truck CAFE standards. 
 
In December 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA).  EISA 
mandates the setting of separate standards for passenger cars and for light trucks at levels 
sufficient to ensure that the average fuel economy of the combined fleet of all passenger cars and 
light trucks sold by all manufacturers in the U.S. in model year 2020 equals or exceeds 35 miles 
per gallon.  That is a 40 percent increase above the average of approximately 25 miles per gallon 
for the current combined fleet. 
 
This notice proposes standards for model years (MY) 2011-2015, the maximum number of 
model years under EISA for which NHTSA can establish standards in a single rulemaking.  
However, the Act gives NHTSA authority to reform passenger car CAFE, allowing the agency to 
set standards for those vehicles according to an attribute-based mathematical function as it 
currently does for light trucks.   
 
The dual fuel incentive program, through which manufacturers may improve their calculated fuel 
economies by producing vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels, is not considered in 
this analysis.  By law, the agency has always analyzed fuel economy without considering the 
dual fuel credits, since it is an incentive program designed to increase the availability of 
alternative fuel vehicles.   
 
Throughout this analysis, unless otherwise noted, the agency has not considered the ability of 
manufacturers to use credits or credit trading in achieving the alternative fuel economy levels.

II.  NEED OF THE NATION TO CONSERVE ENERGY  
 
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) states that: 
 
“When deciding maximum feasible average fuel economy … the Secretary of 
Transportation shall consider technological feasibility, economic practicability, the 
effect of other motor vehicle standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the 
need of the United States to conserve energy.”9 
 
Thus, (EPCA) specifically directs the Department to balance the technological and economic 
challenges related to fuel economy with the nation's need to conserve energy.  The concerns 
about energy security and the effects of energy prices and supply on national economic well-
being that led to the enactment of EPCA persist today.  The demand for petroleum is steadily 
growing in the U.S. and around the world.   
 
Since 1970, there have been a series of events that suggest that the behavior of petroleum 
markets is a matter for public concern. 
• Crude oil prices are currently in the neighborhood of $100 per barrel.  As recently as 
1998, crude prices averaged about $13 per barrel ($15.85 in 2006 dollars).10  Gasoline 
prices have more than doubled during this period.11 
• U.S. domestic oil production peaked in 1970 at 11.3 million barrels per day.  Between 
1970 and 2006, U.S. domestic production has declined by nearly 40 percent, while U.S. 
petroleum consumption has increased by 40 percent.  Net petroleum imports now account 
for 60 percent of U.S. domestic petroleum consumption.12  
• Worldwide oil demand is very inelastic:  declining prices do not induce large increases in 
consumption, while higher prices do not restrain consumption.  Thus, relatively minor 
changes in quantity demanded can induce large changes in price.  Within the United 
States, demand for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel within the transportation sector is 
particularly inelastic.   
• Demand for oil may increase significantly in Asia and worldwide in the future resulting 
in competition for oil supplies.    
• Oil production facilities, refineries, and supply chains have been disrupted from time to 
time, either by wars, political action by oil producers, civil unrest, or natural disasters.   
• High oil prices, sometimes induced by disruptions in oil markets, have often coincided 
with rising inflation and subsequent economic recessions.

• Greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of petroleum have become a subject of 
increasing public policy concern, both in the United States and internationally.  
Greenhouse gases in general and carbon dioxide in particular have not thus far been 
subject to national regulation.  Studies by multiple sources suggest that rising 
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will damage human health and welfare.13  
There is a direct linkage between the consumption of fossil energy and emissions of the 
greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, as essentially all of the carbon in hydrocarbon fuels is 
oxidized into carbon dioxide when the fuel is combusted.  Reducing U.S. fossil energy 
consumption will generally induce a proportional reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.    
 
 
Energy is an essential input to the U.S. economy, and having a strong economy is essential to 
maintaining and strengthening our national security.  Secure, reliable, and affordable energy 
sources are fundamental to economic stability and development.  Rising energy demand poses a 
challenge to energy security, given increased reliance on global energy markets.  As noted 
above, U.S. energy consumption has increasingly been outstripping U.S. energy production.   
 
Table II-1 presents trend data on the production and consumption of petroleum.  Domestic 
petroleum production has been decreasing over time, while imports of petroleum have been 
increasing to meet the rising U.S. demand for petroleum.     
 
Conserving energy, especially reducing the nation’s dependence on petroleum, benefits 
the U.S. in several ways.  Improving energy efficiency has benefits for economic growth 
and the environment, as well as other benefits, such as reducing pollution and improving 
security of energy supply.  More specifically, reducing total petroleum use decreases our 
economy’s vulnerability to oil price shocks.  Reducing dependence on oil imports from 
regions with uncertain conditions enhances our energy security and can reduce the flow 
of oil profits to certain states now hostile to the U.S.   
 
This reformed CAFE proposal would encourage broader use of fuel saving technologies, 
resulting in more fuel-efficient vehicles and greater overall fuel economy.

III.  REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES  
 
In developing the proposed standards, the agency considered the four statutory factors 
underlying maximum feasibility as defined in EPCA (technological feasibility, economic 
practicability, the effect of other standards of the Government on fuel economy, and the 
need of the nation to conserve energy) as well as other relevant considerations such as 
safety.  NHTSA assessed what fuel saving technologies would be available, how 
effective they are, and how quickly they could be introduced.  This assessment 
considered technological feasibility, economic practicability and associated energy 
conservation.  We also considered other standards to the extent captured by EPCA14 and 
environmental and safety concerns.  This information was factored into the computer 
model used by NHTSA for applying technologies to particular vehicle models.  The 
agency then balanced the factors relevant to standard setting. NHTSA’s NEPA analysis, 
discussed in the preamble of the accompanying notice, also will inform NHTSA’s 
consideration of the proposed standards and reasonable alternatives in developing a final 
rule. 
 
In balancing these factors, NHTSA generally observes that the increasing application of 
technologies increases fuel economy and associated benefits, but it also increases costs.  
Initial applications of technologies provide far more fuel savings per dollar of 
expenditure than applications of remaining technologies, which provide less incremental 
fuel savings at greater cost and, with progressive additions of technologies, eventually far 
greater cost.  At some stage, the increasing application of technologies is not justified.  A 
significant question is what methodology and decisionmaking criteria are used in the 
balancing to determine when to cease adding technologies and thus arrive at regulatory 
fuel economy targets. 
 
In developing its proposed standards, the agency used a net benefit-maximizing analysis 
that placed monetary values on relevant externalities (both energy security and 
environmental externalities, including the benefits of reductions in CO2 emissions) and 
produced what is called the “optimized scenario.”  The optimized standards reflect levels 
such that, considering the seven largest manufacturers, net benefits (that is, total benefits 
minus total costs) are higher than at every other examined level of stringency.  The 
agency also reviewed the results of the model’s estimates of stringencies maximizing net 
benefits to assure that the results made sense in terms of balancing EPCA’s statutory 
factors and in meeting EISA’s requirements for improved fuel economy. 
 
In addition to the optimized scenario, NHTSA considered and analyzed five additional 
regulatory alternatives that do not rely upon marginal benefit-cost analysis.  In ascending 
order of stringency, the six alternatives are: 
•Standards that fall below the optimized scenario by the same absolute amount by 
which the +25 percent alternative exceeds the optimized scenario (“25 percent below 
optimized” alternative), 
                                                 
14   71 Fed. Reg. 17566, 17669-70; April 6, 2006. 
  
III-2  
•Standards based on applying technologies until net benefits are maximized 
(optimized scenario), and 
•Standards that exceed the optimized scenario by 25 percent of the interval 
between the optimized scenario and the TC=TB alternative (see below) (“25 percent 
above optimized” alternative), 
•Standards that exceed the optimized scenario by 50 percent of the interval 
between the optimized scenario and the TC=TB alternative (“50 percent above 
optimized” alternative), 
•Standards based on applying technologies until total costs equal total benefits, 
i.e, until there are zero net benefits (TC=TB alternative),15 and 
•Standards based on applying all feasible technologies without regard to cost 
(technology exhaustion alternative).16 
 
NHTSA chose these alternatives in order to consider and evaluate the impacts of 
balancing the EPCA factors differently in determining maximum feasibility than the 
agency has in prior rulemakings.  In Center for Biological Diversity v. NHTSA, the Ninth 
Circuit Court recognized that “EPCA gives NHTSA discretion to decide how to balance 
the statutory factors—as long as NHTSA’s balancing does not undermine the 
fundamental purpose of EPCA: energy conservation.”  508 F.3d 508, 527 (9th Cir. 2007).  
The Court also raised the possibility that NHTSA’s current balancing of the statutory 
factors might be different from the agency’s balancing in the past, given the greater 
importance today of the need of the nation to conserve energy and more advanced 
understanding of climate change.  Id. at 530-31. 
 
NHTSA recognizes that numerous alternative CAFE levels are theoretically conceivable 
and that the alternatives described above essentially represent only several on a 
continuum of alternatives.  Along the continuum, each alternative represents a different 
way in which NHTSA conceivably could assign weight to each of the four EPCA factors 
and NEPA’s policies.  For the alternatives that fall above the optimized scenario (the +25, 
+50 and TC=TB alternatives), the agency would evaluate policies that put increasingly 
more emphasis on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, given their impact 
on global warming, and less on the other factors, including the economic impacts on the 
industry.  Conversely, for the alternative that falls below the optimum scenario, the 
agency would evaluate policies that place relatively more weight on the economic health 
of the industry and less on reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. 
                                                 
15   The agency considered the “TC=TB” alternative because one or more commenters in the rulemaking on 
standards for MY 2008-2011 light trucks urged NHTSA to consider setting the standards on this basis 
rather than on the basis of maximizing net benefits.  In addition, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
concluded that EPCA neither requires nor prohibits the setting of standards at the level at which net 
benefits are maximized, the Court raised concerns about tilting the balance more toward reducing energy 
consumption and CO2.   
16 This was accomplished by determining the stringency at which a reformed standard would require every 
manufacturer to apply every technology estimated to be potentially available.  At such stringencies, all but 
one manufacturer would be expected to fail to comply with the standard, and many manufacturers would 
owe large civil penalties as a result.  The agency considered this alternative because the agency wished to 
explore the stringency and consequences of standards based solely on the potential availability of 
technologies at the individual manufacturer level. 
 
  
III-3  
 
For reasons such as those set forth in this section, NHTSA’s provisional analysis of the 
alternatives described above suggests that some of them may not satisfy the four EPCA 
factors that NHTSA must apply in setting “maximum feasible” CAFE standards.  
NHTSA seeks comments on the proposed standards and the regulatory alternatives to aid 
the agency’s determination of what standards to adopt in the final rule. 
 
The graphs below show, for passenger cars, light trucks, and the combined fleet, the 
average annual fuel economy levels for the four alternatives as compared to the proposed 
standards.  Subsequent graphs and tables present their estimated costs, benefits, and net 
benefits (in billions of dollars).  In addition, tables are provided summarizing the average 
extent to which manufacturers’ CAFE levels are projected to fall short of CAFE 
standards—i.e., the average shortfall—under each of these alternatives.  Manufacturer-
specific shortfall is shown for the proposed and TC=TB alternative.

Negative values mean that costs exceed benefits.   
 
In tentatively deciding which alternative to propose, the agency looked at a variety of 
factors.  The agency notes that once stringency levels exceed the point at which net 
benefits are maximized, the societal costs of each incremental increase in stringency 
exceed the accompanying societal benefits.  If we have valued benefits appropriately, it 
does not make economic sense to mandate the spending of more money than society 
receives in return.  The resources used to meet overly stringent CAFE standards, instead 
  
III-13  
of the optimized scenario standards, would better be allocated to other uses such as 
technology research and development, or improvements in vehicle safety.   
 
The agency considered the burden placed on specific manufacturers, consumers and 
employment.  As CAFE standards increase, the incremental benefits are approximately 
constant while the incremental costs increase rapidly.  Figure III-5 above shows that as 
stringency is increased, costs rise out of proportion compared to the benefits or the fuel 
savings.  Increasingly higher costs have a negative impact on sales and employment.  
Each of the alternatives that is more stringent than the optimized alternative negatively 
impact sales and employment.  
 
The agency also considered technological feasibility. The Volpe model assumes that 
major manufacturers will exhaust all available technology before paying noncompliance 
civil penalties, even though the latter is often less costly. Historically, the large 
manufacturers have never paid civil penalties.  NHTSA believes that there is a stigma to 
paying penalties that goes beyond economics.  In the more stringent alternatives, the 
Volpe model predicts that increasing numbers of manufacturers will run out of 
technology to apply and, theoretically, resort to penalty payment.  Setting standards this 
high is not technologically feasible, nor does it serve the need of the nation to conserve 
fuel.  Paying a CAFE penalty does not result in any fuel savings.  
 
In analyzing the “-25 percent below optimized” alternative, the agency notes that these 
standards are more aggressive than the standards that the agency has proposed since the 
first years of the program and would impose unprecedented costs on manufacturers.  The 
agency also recognizes that even this pace of increase in the standards may burden some 
of the manufacturers, particularly since the agency is now increasing car and light truck 
standards simultaneously.  However, in light of the need of the nation to conserve energy 
and reduce global warming, the agency does not believe that this alternative would be 
maximum feasible under the statute.  The agency is also concerned that the combined 
fleet might not reach the 35 mpg requirement by 2020 under EISA.   
 
Underlying the differences in costs, benefits, and net benefits for the other alternatives 
are differences in the degree to which NHTSA has estimated that technologies might be 
applied in response to the standards corresponding to each of these alternatives.  The 
following tables show estimates of the average penetration rates of some selected 
technologies in the MY2015 passenger car and light truck fleets under each of the 
alternatives discussed here:

As the first of the above tables indicates, the Volpe model estimated that, under the 
standards proposed today, manufacturers might triple the planned utilization of 
turbochargers and hybrid electric powertrains in the passenger car fleet.  This table also 
indicates that the use of turbochargers in passenger cars might increase by an additional 
factor of two under the “25% above proposed” alternative. 
 
Similarly, the second table indicates that manufacturers might triple the planned 
utilization of diesel engines in the light truck fleet, and increase the utilization of hybrid 
electric powertrains by more than an order of magnitude.  This table also shows a 
significant difference between the proposed and “25% above proposed” alternative, 
including an additional doubling in the utilization of diesel engines. 
 
NHTSA has examined the extent to which each alternative would (as estimated by the 
Volpe model and using the input information discussed in preceding sections) cause 
manufacturers to exhaust technologies projected to be available during MY2011-
MY2015.  The following chart summarizes the frequency with which this was estimated 
to occur —i.e., the number of instances in which an individual manufacturer exhausted 
technologies and thus fell below a standard in individual model years divided by 35 
(seven manufacturers times five model years. 
  
III-15  
Figure III-6 
Calculated Prevalence of Technology Exhaustion 
 
 
 
As this analysis indicates, the “25% below proposed” alternative caused technologies to 
be exhausted 3% of the time for passenger cars, and 17% of the time for light trucks.  
Under the proposed standards, the rate of technology exhaustion increased to 11% for 
passenger cars, but did not change for light trucks.  However, under the “25% above 
proposed” alternative, the corresponding rates increased to 26% and 37%, respectively.  
In other words, under this alternative, the Volpe model estimated that, more than a 
quarter of the time, manufacturers would be unable to comply with the passenger car 
standards solely using technologies expected to be available, and that they would be

unable to comply with the light truck standards using available technologies more than a 
third of the time.  These rates were estimated to be considerably higher for the remaining 
three alternatives. 
 
These estimates of technology utilization and the exhaustion of available technologies 
indicate that all of the alternatives NHTSA has considered entail risk that one or more 
manufacturers would not be able comply with both the passenger car and light truck 
standards in every model year solely by applying technology.  This risk is mitigated 
somewhat by the fact that our analysis may not encompass every technology that will 
potentially be available during MY2011-MY2015.  For example, some manufacturers 
have made public statements regarding hopes to offer “plug-in” HEVs before MY2015, 
but such vehicles are not represented in our analysis.17  Nonetheless, the agency has 
tentatively concluded that the scope of technologies it has included is comprehensive 
enough that the analysis shown above indicates that under some alternatives, there is 
considerable risk that some manufacturers would exhaust available technologies in some 
model years. 
 
In tentatively concluding that the proposed standards are the maximum feasible 
standards, NHTSA has balanced this risk against the other considerations it must take 
into account, in particular the need of the nation to conserve energy, which encompasses 
concerns regarding carbon dioxide emissions.  The agency’s analysis includes economic 
measures of these needs—that is, economic measures of the externalities of petroleum 
consumption and the damages associated with carbon dioxide emissions.  These measures 
are reflected in the agency’s estimates of the total and net benefits of each of the 
alternatives. 
 
NHTSA is proposing standards that it estimates will entail risk that some manufacturers 
will exhaust available technologies in some model years.  However, relative to the less 
stringent “25% below proposed” alternative, the agency has tentatively concluded that the 
additional risk is outweighed by the significant increase in estimated net benefits to 
society, ranging from an additional $0.5b in MY2011 to an additional $2.1b in MY2015.  
Conversely, the agency has tentatively concluded that, relative to the proposed standards, 
the more than doubling of risk posed by the “25% above proposed” alternative is not 
warranted, especially considering that this alternative is estimated to significantly reduce 
net benefits, by $0.5b in MY2011 and, eventually, $4.3b in MY2015.  
 
The agency invites comment regarding whether it has struck a proper balance and, if not, 
how it should do so.  The alternatives identified by the agency are intended to aid public 
commenters in helping the agency to explore that issue. 
   
Notwithstanding the tentative conclusions described above, NHTSA seeks comment on 
these regulatory alternatives to aid in determining what standards to adopt in the final 
rule.  Specific sensitivity runs that vary fuel prices, the rebound effect, CO2 and discount 
rate were conducted for the proposed optimized standards.  These analyses have an

analysis for the final rule.

impact on the standards, costs and benefits.  For example, in analyzing the “optimized 
alternative”, we estimated that following the same methods and criteria for setting the 
standards, but applying a 3% discount rate rather than a 7% discount rate, would suggest 
standards reaching about 33.6 mpg (average required fuel economy among both 
passenger cars and light trucks) in MY2015, 2 mpg higher than the 31.6 mpg average 
resulting from the standards we are proposing based on a 7% discount rate.  The more 
stringent standards during MY2011-MY2015 would reduce CO2 emissions by 672 
million metric tons (mmt), or 29% more than the 521 mmt achieved by the proposed 
standards.  On the other hand, we estimate that standards increasing at this pace would 
require about $85b in technology outlays during MY2011-MY2015, or 89% more than 
the $45b in technology outlays associated with the standards proposed today.  The impact 
of the 3% rate is shown in the body of the PRIA along with the 6 formal alternatives.  All 
other sensitivity analyses are shown in Chapter IX.

IV. IMPACT OF OTHER FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS ON  
  FUEL ECONOMY 
 
Introduction 
The Energy Policy and Conservation (EPCA or the Act) requires that fuel economy 
standards be set at the maximum feasible level after taking into account the following 
criteria:  (1) technological feasibility, (2) economic practicability, (3) the impact of other 
Federal Motor Vehicle Standards on fuel economy, and (4) the need of the Nation to 
conserve energy.  This section discusses the effects of other government regulations on 
model year (MY) 2011-2015 passenger car and light truck fuel economy. 
 
The Impact of Safety Standards and Voluntary Safety Improvements  
The fuel economy impact of safety improvements will typically take the form of 
increased vehicle weight, which reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle.  The 
manufacturer’s estimates of weight and fuel economy impact have already been included 
in their baseline fuel economy projections.  In some instances the manufacturers’ weight 
estimates are similar to NHTSA’s, in some instances they are less than NHTSA’s, but 
often they are more than NHTSA’s.  The agency’s estimates are based on cost and weight 
tear-down studies of a few vehicles and cannot possibly cover all the variations in the 
manufacturers’ fleets.  NHTSA requested and various manufacturers provided estimates 
of increases in weight resulting from safety improvements, based on a MY 2007 baseline.  
However, for the passenger car and light truck proposal MY 2010 is the baseline.  Thus, 
only safety equipment required to be installed or voluntarily installed after these dates are 
included in this analysis.       
 
We have broken down our analysis of the impact of safety standards that might affect the 
MY 2011-2015 fleets into two parts, those final rules with known effective dates, and 
proposed rules without final effective dates or currently voluntary safety improvements.   
 
Weight Impacts of Required Safety Standards (Final Rules) 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has issued two final rules 
on safety standards that become effective for passenger cars and light trucks between MY 
2011 and MY 2015.  These have been analyzed for their potential impact on passenger 
car and light truck weights, using MY 2010 as a baseline.   
 
1. FMVSS 126, Electronic Stability Control 
2. FMVSS 214, Side Impact  Oblique Pole Test 
 
 
FMVSS 126, Electronic Stability Control 
The phase-in schedule for vehicle manufacturers is: 
Model Year Production Beginning Date Requirement 
2009 September 1, 2008 55% with carryover credit 
2010 September 1, 2009 75% with carryover credit 
2011 September 1, 2010 95% with carryover credit 
2012 September 1, 2011 All light vehicles 
  
IV-2  
 
The final rule requires 75 percent of all light vehicles to meet the ESC requirement for 
MY 2010, 95 percent of all light vehicles to meet the ESC requirements by MY 2011, 
and all light vehicles must meet the requirements by MY 2012.     
 
The agency’s analysis of weight impacts found that ABS adds 10.7 lbs. and ESC adds 1.8 
lbs. per vehicle for a total of 12.5 lbs.  Based on manufacturers’ plans for voluntary 
installation of ESC, 85 percent of passenger cars in MY 2010 would have ABS and 52 
percent would have ESC.  Thus, the total incremental added weight over manufacturers’ 
plans in MY 2011 for passenger cars would be about 1.8 lbs. (0.10*10.7 + 0.43*1.8) and 
in MY 2012 an incremental 0.6 lbs. (0.05*10.7 + 0.05*1.8).  Light trucks manufacturers’ 
plans show that 99 percent of all light trucks would have ABS and that 74 percent would 
have ESC by MY 2010.  Thus, for light trucks the incremental weight impacts of adding 
ESC would be 0.4 lbs. (0.21*1.8) in MY 2011 and an incremental 0.1 lbs. (0.01*10.7 + 
0.05*1.8) in MY 2012.

The phase-in requirements for the side impact test are as shown below in Table IV-118:

Based on manufacturers’ plans to voluntarily provide window curtains and torso bags, we 
estimate that 90 percent of passenger cars and light trucks would have window curtains 
for MY 2010 and 72 percent would have torso bags.   A very similar percentage is 
estimated for MY 2011.  A teardown study of 5 thorax air bags resulted in an average 
weight increase per vehicle of 4.77 pounds (2.17 kg).19  A second study20 performed 
teardowns of 5 window curtain systems.  One of the window curtain systems was very

heavy (23.45 pounds).  The other four window curtain systems had an average weight 
increase per vehicle of 6.78 pounds (3.08 kg), a figure which is assumed to be average for 
all vehicles in the future.   
 
Assuming in the future that the typical system used to comply with the requirements of 
FMVSS No. 214 will be thorax bags with a window curtain, the average weight increase 
would be 2 pounds (0.10*6.78 + 0.28*4.77) in MY 2013.  However, there is the potential 
that some light trucks might need to add structure to meet the test.   The agency has no 
estimate of this potential weight impact for structure.   
 
Weight Impacts of Proposed/Planned Safety Standards 
 
Proposed FMVSS 216, Roof Crush 
On August 23, 2005, NHTSA proposed amending the roof crush standard to increase the 
roof crush standard from 1.5 times the vehicle weight to 2.5 times the vehicle weight21.  
The NPRM proposed to extend the standard to vehicles with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds 
or less, thus including many light trucks that had not been required to meet the standard 
in the past.  The proposed effective date was the first September 1 occurring three years 
after publication of the final rule.  In the PRIA, the average passenger car weight was 
estimated to increase by 4.0 pounds and the average light truck weight was estimated to 
increase by 6.1 pounds for a 2.5 strength to weight ratio.  Based on comments to the 
NPRM, the agency believes that this weight estimate is likely to increase.  However, the 
agency does not yet have an estimate for the final rule.    
  
Planned NHTSA initiative on Ejection Mitigation 
The agency is planning on issuing a proposal on ejection mitigation.  The likely result of 
the planned proposal is for window curtain side air bags to be larger and for a rollover 
sensor to be installed.  The likely result will be an increase in weight of at least one 
pound, however, this analysis is not completed.  In addition, advanced glazing is one 
alternative that manufacturers might pursue for specific window applications (possibly 
for fixed windows for third row applications) or more broadly.  Advanced glazing is 
likely to have weight implications.  Again the agency has not made an estimate of the 
likelihood that advanced glazing might be used or its weight implications.    
 
Possible NHTSA initiative on Pedestrian Protection 
The agency has started to analyze the costs and benefits of a potential Global Technical 
Regulation on pedestrian protection.  Whether the agency will propose a rulemaking and 
the effective dates have not been decided, however, it is possible that a rule on pedestrian 
protection could start to be phased in by the end of the period of this proposed 
rulemaking.  Potential weight increases for pedestrian head and leg protection have not 
yet been identified.  
 
Summary – Overview of Anticipated Weight Increases

IV-4  
The following table summarizes estimates made by NHTSA regarding the weight added 
in MY 2011 or later to institute the above discussed standards or likely rulemakings.  In 
summary, NHTSA estimates that weight additions required by final rules and likely 
NHTSA regulations effective in MY 2011 and beyond, compared to the MY 2010 fleet 
and manufacturers’ plans, will increase passenger car weight by at least 9.4 lbs. and light 
truck weight by at least 9.6 lbs.

Based on NHTSA’s weight-versus-fuel-economy algorithms, a 3-4 pound increase in 
weight equates to a loss of 0.01 mpg in fuel economy.  Thus, the agency’s estimate of the 
safety/weight effects are 0.024 to 0.032 mpg or more for already issued or likely future 
safety standards.      
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL SUBMISSIONS 
Weight Impacts of Potential Future Voluntary Safety Improvements  
At the time the agency requested information about fuel economy plans and capabilities 
for the future, the agency also requested information on weight increases that could occur 
due to safety improvements.  Several manufacturers provided confidential information 
about plans they had to meet final rules, proposed safety standards, or to voluntarily 
increase safety.  The baseline for these plans was MY 2007.  Several of these plans were 
to meet IIHS offset frontal of side impact testing.  Most of these improvements will be 
installed on vehicles by MY 2011.  [                                                                                                
.]  Thus, many of them will have occurred by the time this rulemaking is effective.  The 
areas covered above and the remaining areas described as voluntary safety initiatives that 
have weight implications and the confidential weight estimates are shown in Table IV-3 
after MY 2007 and on Table IV-3a for those initiatives taking affect after MY 2011.

IV-7  
Vehicle Size and Safety 
NHTSA believes that an attribute based Reformed CAFE system removes the incentive 
to downsize that is inherent in the traditional fleet-wide CAFE flat standard requirement.  
The agency believes that the attribute based standard is likely to have beneficial impacts 
on safety compared to the flat standard. Other things being equal, smaller vehicles 
provide less protection to their occupants in the event of a crash because there is less 
vehicle mass to absorb the crash energy and less interior space to buffer occupants from 
sheet metal intrusion.  In addition, smaller vehicles are generally more likely to roll over.  
In single vehicle crashes, smaller vehicles are less safe than larger vehicles.  In multi-
vehicle crashes, both individual vehicle size and the relative size of the involved vehicles 
play a role in determining the injury outcome of occupants.  Generally, larger vehicles 
will provide better protection, but often at the expense of occupants of smaller vehicles.  
If larger vehicles were to be reduced in size, it would likely decrease the chance of injury 
in crashes with smaller vehicles, but it would also likely increase the chance of injury for 
the occupants of the larger vehicles.  The makeup of any future mix-shifts in vehicle sales 
is purely speculative and the overall impact on injuries in multi-vehicle crashes of any 
future mix-shifts in vehicle size is unknown.  However, downsizing is likely to increase 
the crash risk for vehicle occupants in single vehicle crashes, which make up 30% of all 
crashes and 57% of all fatalities.  An attribute based system will require improvements in 
fuel economy for all vehicle sizes, and will thus minimize incentives to downsize 
vehicles. 
  
   
The NAS study 
The 2002 National Academy of Sciences (NAS)22 report made explicit links between 
weight and vehicle safety.  The NAS study conclusions were divided, with 11 of 13 
committee members representing the majority view and 2 of 13 the minority view.  The 
findings of the majority presented on page 77 were: 
“In summary, the majority of the committee finds that the downsizing and weight 
reduction that occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s most likely produced between 
1,300 and 2,600 crash fatalities and between 13,000 and 26,000 serious injuries in 1993.  
The proportion of these casualties attributable to CAFE standards is uncertain.  It is not 
clear that significant weight reduction can be achieved in the future without some 
downsizing, and similar downsizing would be expected to produce similar results.  Even 
if weight reduction occurred without any downsizing, casualties would be expected to 
increase.  Thus, any increase in CAFE as currently structured could produce additional 
road casualties, unless it is specifically targeted at the largest, heaviest light trucks.”  … 
“Some might argue that this improving safety picture means that there is room to improve 
fuel economy without adverse safety consequences.  However, such a measure would not 
achieve the goal of avoiding the adverse safety consequences of fuel economy increases.  
Rather, the safety penalty imposed by increased fuel economy (if weight reduction is one 
of the measures) will be more difficult to identify in the light of the continuing 
improvement in traffic safety.  Just because these anticipated safety innovations will

Research Council, 2002.  The link for the NAS report is http://www.nap.edu/books/0309076013/html/ 
  
IV-8  
improve the safety of vehicles of all sizes does not mean that downsizing to achieve fuel 
economy improvements will have no safety costs. 
 
If an increase in fuel economy is effected by a system that encourages either 
downweighting or the production and sale of more small cars, some additional traffic 
fatalities would be expected.  Without a thoughtful restructuring of the program, that 
would be the trade-off that must be made if CAFE standards are increased by any 
significant amount.” 
 
The minority view summarized on page 123 was: 
 “The relationship between vehicle weight and safety are complex and not 
measurable with any reasonable degree of certainty at present.  The relationship of fuel 
economy to safety is even more tenuous.  But this does not mean that there is no reason 
for concern.  Significant fuel economy improvements will require major changes in 
vehicle design.  Safety is always an issue whenever vehicles must be redesigned. 
 In addition, the distribution of vehicle weights is an important safety issue.  Safety 
benefits should be possible if the weight distribution of light-duty vehicles could be made 
more uniform, and economic gains might result from even partly correcting the negative 
externality that encourages individuals to transfer safety risks to others by buying ever 
larger and heavier vehicles. 
 Finally, it appears that in certain kinds of accidents, reducing weight will increase 
safety risk, while in others it may reduce it.  Reducing the weights of light-duty vehicles 
will neither benefit nor harm all highway users, there will be winners and losers….”      
 
 
The Kahane Study 
The Kahane study23 estimates the effect of 100-pound reductions in heavy light trucks 
and vans (LTVs), light LTVs, heavy passenger cars, and light passenger cars.  It 
compares the fatality rates of LTVs and cars to quantify differences between vehicle 
types, given drivers of the same age/gender, etc.  Some of its findings are: 
 “Heavy vehicles had lower fatality rates per billion miles of travel than lighter 
vehicles of the same general type.  When two vehicles collide, the laws of physics favor 
the occupants on the heavier vehicle (momentum conservation).  Furthermore, heavy 
vehicles were in most cases, longer, wider and less fragile than light vehicles.  In part 
because of this, they usually had greater crashworthiness, structural integrity and 
directional stability.  They were less rollover-prone and easier for the average driver to 
control in a panic situation.  In other words, heavier vehicles tended to be more 
crashworthy and less crash-prone.  Some of the advantages for heavier vehicles are not 
preordained by the laws of physics, but were nevertheless characteristic of the MY 9991-
99 fleet.  Offsetting those advantages, heavier vehicles tended to be more aggressive in 
crashes, increasing risk to occupants of the vehicles they collide with.”     
 
Six different crash modes were analyzed (principal rollover, fixed object, 
pedestrian/bicycle/motorcyclist, and multi-vehicle crashes with heavy truck, light trucks, 
                                                 
23  “Vehicle Weight, Fatality Risk and Crash Compatibility of Model Year 1991-99 Passenger Cars and 
Light Trucks”, Charles J. Kahane, Ph. D., NHTSA, October 2003, DOT HS 809-662.  
  
IV-9  
and passenger cars).  Summing all these crash modes together, the net annual effects per 
100-pound weight reduction were: 
For passenger cars weighing less than 2,950 pounds – fatalities increased by 597 
For passenger cars weighing 2,950 pounds or more – fatalities increased by 216 
For light trucks weighing less than 3,870 pounds – fatalities increased by 234 
For light trucks weighing 3,870 pounds or more – fatalities increased by 71 
 
In all cases, annual fatalities increased with a reduction in weight.  However, further 
analysis of the Kahane study found that the net safety effect of removing 100 pounds 
from a light truck is zero for the group of all light trucks with a curb weight greater than 
3,900 lbs. 24  Given the significant statistical uncertainty around that figure, we assumed a 
confidence bound of approximately 1,000 lbs. and used 5,000 lbs. as the threshold for 
considering weight reduction of specific models.  In the MY 2008-2011 light truck final 
rule, NHTSA included weight reduction as a fuel improving technology for light trucks 
over 5,000 lbs. curb weight where we determined that weight reduction would not reduce 
overall safety and would be a cost-effective choice.  We are applying the same 
methodology in this proposal, weight reduction is considered a technology that can be 
applied to light trucks over 5,000 lbs. curb weight.   
 
The agency believes a number of conclusions can be drawn from these studies: 
 
• Heavier vehicles are more crashworthy and less crash prone.25   
• The net impacts on safety, considering the six different crash modes, of reducing 
weight are negative for all but the larger light trucks.  However, this type of 
analysis can not examine extreme cases.  For example, if there were a large mix 
shift from 50 percent passenger car and 50 percent light truck sales, to 80 percent 
compact or smaller passenger cars and 20 percent pickup truck sales, this analysis 
cannot determine the net impacts on safety.  Nothing in the manufacturer’s plans 
suggests a drastic change in the mix of vehicles, nor is there any incentive, in our 
opinion, for such a change based on NHTSA’s attribute based proposal on fuel 
economy.       
• Lighter vehicles fare worse in single vehicle collisions.  In 2006, 57 percent of all 
passenger car and light truck fatalities were in single vehicle crashes and 43 
percent were in multi-vehicle crashes.  Fatalities are almost split between 
rollovers (29 percent) and fixed or non-fixed objects (28 percent).    
• Reducing weight increases the likelihood of rolling over.  When you are sliding 
sideways and digging into mud or grass or hit a curb, all things being equal, the 
lighter vehicle is more prone to rolling over.  Increasing track width (part of the 
footprint calculation) reduces the likelihood of rolling over.  Track width is more 
important than weight for rollovers.  Rollover is the only area in which track

width is the most important factor.  Weight is more important than track width or 
wheelbase in the other five crash modes investigated.26   
• Reducing weight increases the likelihood of being killed in a fixed or non-fixed 
object crash.  If you run into a tree, you are safer if you knock that tree down than 
if the tree stops your vehicle.  A heavier vehicle has a better chance of knocking 
the tree down.   
 
 
The Kahane report also examined the total fatality crash rates in all crash modes;  
including fatalities to occupants of the case vehicle (i.e. in rollovers, single vehicle and 
multi-vehicle crashes), occupants of the other vehicle it collided with (to account for 
aggressive vehicles) and pedestrians.  Kahane used VMT data based on CDS odometer 
readings and controlled for age and gender based on State data on nonculpable crash 
involvements (induced exposure).  With these controls, the societal fatality rates per 
billion miles were:

Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety commented that Kahane’s (NHTSA’s) 2003 
analysis may not apply if the effects of size and weight reductions are disaggregated, 
“weight reductions without corresponding reductions in vehicle wheelbase length and 
track width could be expected to produce net benefits in reducing occupant crash risks.” 
 
NHTSA’s response is that Footprint (especially track width) is an important variable in 
terms of a vehicle’s propensity for rollovers, a type of crash that accounts for 29 percent 
of all light vehicle occupant traffic fatalities. Track width is one of the two vehicle 
properties that define Static Stability Factor (SSF).  SSF was used as a single 
predominant factor to predict rollover rate in the agency’s original rollover NCAP, and it 
is still the most powerful element in the agency’s current rollover NCAP risk model that 
also factors in a road maneuver test.  Wheelbase does not have a direct effect on rollover 
resistance.  However, there are hypotheses that an increase in wheelbase could reduce 
loss-of-control crashes by making the vehicle react slower in yaw and thereby reduce the 
number of single-vehicle pavement departure crashes that produce most rollovers.  
Currently, the agency does not have any data to substantiate this theory.27   
 
We would like to clarify that our analysis does not mandate weight reduction, or any 
specific technology application for that matter.  Our analysis relied exclusively on other 
fuel-saving technologies for passenger cars and only applied weight reduction to light 
trucks that have a curb weight greater than 5,000 lbs. to demonstrate that manufacturers 
can comply with the proposed fuel economy levels without the need for potentially 
unsafe compliance measures.   
 
Honda cited several reports, which it asserted demonstrated that limited weight 
reductions would not reduce safety and could possibly decrease overall fatalities.  Honda 
stated that the 2003 study by DRI found that reducing weight without reducing size 
slightly decreased fatalities, and that this was confirmed in a 2004 study by DRI28 that 
assessed new data and methodology changes in the 2003 Kahane Study. Honda asserted 
that the DRI results tend to confirm “that curb weight reduction would be expected to 
decrease the overall number of fatalities.”   
 
DRI submitted an additional study, Supplemental Results on the Independent Effects of 
Curb Weight, Wheelbase, and Track Width on Fatality Risk in 1985-1998 Model Year 
Passenger Cars and 1985-1997 Model Year LTVs, Van Auken, R.M. and J. W. Zellner, 
May 20, 2005 (Docket No. 2003-16128-1456).  This DRI study concluded that reductions 
in footprint are harmful to safety, whereas reductions in mass while holding footprint 
constant would benefit safety.  The DRI study disagreed with NHTSA’s finding that mass 
had greater influence than track width or wheelbase on the fatality risk of passenger cars 
in non-rollover crashes.   
 
While NHTSA agrees that limited weight reduction to heavier vehicles will not reduce 
safety, we disagree with DRI’s overall conclusion, cited by Honda, that weight reductions

while holding footprint constant would significantly benefit safety in lighter vehicles.  
NHTSA’s analyses of the relationships between fatality risk, mass, track width and 
wheelbase in 4-door 1991-1999 passenger cars (Docket No. 2003-16318-16) found a 
strong relationship between track width and the rollover fatality rate, but only a modest 
(although significant) relationship between track width and fatality rate in non-rollover 
crashes.  Even controlling for track width and wheelbase – e.g., by holding footprint 
constant – weight reduction in the lighter cars is strongly, significantly associated with 
higher non-rollover fatality rates in the NHTSA analysis.  By contrast, the DRI study of 
May 20, 2005 analyzed 4-door cars and found a strong relationship between track width 
and fatality risk, and non-significant associations of mass and wheelbase with fatality risk 
(Docket No. 2005-22223-78, p. 31).  In other words, when DRI analyzed the same group 
of vehicles as NHTSA, they did not get the same results.  This difference indicates that 
DRI’s analytical method and/or database are not the same as NHTSA’s.   
 
The agency continues to believe that weight reduction in lighter vehicles would reduce 
safety.  However, we also believe that weight reductions in the heavier light trucks, while 
holding footprint constant, will not likely result in a net reduction in safety.   In our 
opinion, it is impossible to reduce weight and maintain footprint unless you (a) substitute 
light for heavy materials in a big way or (b) remove features that customers want and are 
willing to pay for.  In that sense, DRI’s contention that weight is unimportant could only 
be true for material substitution, because under present circumstance weight reduction 
usually also means size reduction, and DRI agrees with NHTSA that a reduction in 
footprint is harmful to safety. 
 
General Motors (Docket No. 2005-22223-1493) and the Alliance (Docket No. 2005-
22223-1642) were more explicit in their concerns over the safety impact associated with 
weight reduction.  The Alliance stated that the fundamental laws of physics dictate that 
smaller and/or lighter vehicles are less safe than larger/heavier counterparts with 
equivalent safety designs and equipment.  General Motors agreed that improvements in 
material strength, flexibility, and vehicle design have helped improve overall vehicle and 
highway safety. But, General Motors added, for a given vehicle, reducing mass generally 
reduces net safety.  Further, General Motors stated that it does not intentionally reduce 
mass by replacing it with advanced materials, presuming that such action alone will result 
in improved protection for the occupants in a lighter vehicle; instead GM continues to 
believe that vehicles with larger mass will provide better protection to occupants involved 
in a crash than a vehicle of the same design with less mass, given equivalent crashes.   
 
General Motors also questioned the agency’s reliance on a 5,000 lbs. minimum vehicle 
weight for considering weight reduction, which was based on the finding of the 2003 
Kahane report.   General Motors stated that the agency’s conclusion is inconsistent with 
the sensitivity analysis performed by William E. Wecker Associates, Inc.29 and submitted 
to the ANPRM docket.  General Motors stated that the inflection point on the Wecker 
report’s graph for General Motors light trucks in both the periods of MYs 1991-1995 and 
MYs 1996-1999 is higher than 5,000 pounds.

IV-13  
Additionally, General Motors stated that the NPRM did not acknowledge or respond to 
the main point of the Wecker report, which was that Dr. Kahane’s “analysis alone does 
not support the proposition that a crossover weight at or near 5,085 pounds is a robust, 
accurate description of the field performance of the fleet.”  
 
We believe that General Motors was confusing the 5,085 lbs. crossover weight (where 
the safety effect of mass reduction in a vehicle weighing exactly 5,085 lbs., is zero) with 
the breakeven point described in the NPRM, which is the point where the total effect of 
reducing all vehicles heavier than the breakeven weight by an equal amount is zero.  
NHTSA estimated that the breakeven point as described in the NPRM is 3,900 lbs., if 
footprint is held constant.   
 
If the 3,900 lbs. estimate were perfectly accurate, we would be confident that weight 
reductions in vehicles down to 3,900 pounds would not result in net harm to safety.  
However, we agree with commenters that there is considerable uncertainty about the 
crossover weight and also the breakeven point.  Therefore, in our analysis, we limited 
weight reduction to vehicles with a curb weight greater than 5,000 pounds.  We believe 
that the 5,000 lbs. limit is sufficient so that we can be confident that such weight 
reductions will not have net harm on safety.   
 
SUVOA encouraged NHTSA to emphasize the importance of making sure that CAFE 
requirements do not encourage vehicle downsizing “or any other action that might have 
an adverse effect on safety.”  SUVOA cited several reports in support of its assertion that 
downsizing harms safety30.  As explained above, the agency has applied weight reduction 
only to those vehicles for which we are confident that such reduction will not negatively 
impact safety, however, our analysis does not mandate the use of specific technologies or 
weight reductions.   
 
Environmental Defense (Docket No. 2005-22223-1805) commented that by limiting the 
use of weight reduction to heavier vehicles, the agency disregarded the likelihood that 
manufacturers would rely on weight reduction in smaller, lighter vehicles.  
Environmental Defense suggested that the improved baselines should reflect this weight 
reduction strategy.  
 
Environmental Defense asserted that weight reduction is among the most common and 
cost-effective options available to manufacturers for improving vehicle fuel economy 
                                                 
30 SUVOA (see Docket No. 2003-16128-1067) provided the following cites in support of its assertion: 
• 2001, the National Academy of Sciences affirmed that earlier downsizing of vehicles following 
the imposition of CAFE regulations resulted in an additional 1,300 to 2,600 deaths and an 
additional 20,000 serious injuries per year. 
• A Harvard School of Public Health-Brookings Institution study in the 1990s found that vehicle 
downsizing due to federal fuel economy mandates increased occupant deaths by 14 to 27 percent. 
• An in-depth analysis by USA Today in 1999, using NHTSA and auto insurance industry data, 
found that since 1975, 7,700 additional deaths occurred for every mile per gallon gained.  By 
1999, vehicle downsizing had killed more than 46,000 Americans.  Factoring in the ensuing six 
years through 2005, the total conservatively eclipses 55,000 deaths.

across the light truck fleet.  Environmental Defense referenced estimates presented in 
DeCicco (2005) that suggest that the cost per pound of weight reduced through use of 
high-strength steel and advanced engineering techniques has been as low as, or lower 
than, 31 cents per pound reduced.   
 
Moreover, Environmental Defense stated, the exclusion of mass reduction in NHTSA’s 
analysis bears no relation to what will actually happen in the marketplace when standards 
are implemented.  Environmental Defense argued that absent safety regulations 
prohibiting the use of mass reductions, manufacturers are likely to choose this 
compliance alternative in vehicles of all weights as a cost-effective way to comply with 
CAFE.   Environmental Defense stated that NHTSA should consider the potential for 
mass reduction among its compliance alternatives for all light trucks.   
   
As stated above, the agency does not dictate which fuel-savings technologies must be 
applied to vehicles.  Mass reduction is a compliance alternative for all light vehicles.  
However, one of the considerations in setting fuel economy standards is to set standards 
that will not lead to a reduction in safety.  The standards proposed by the agency are 
those capable of being achieved by the manufacturers without the need to reduce safety.  
If the agency were to consider weight reduction as a compliance option, we are 
concerned that the resulting increased stringency would force unsafe downweighting.     
 
A group of experts at a workshop sponsored by the International Council on Clean 
Transportation (ICCT) examined many of the size/safety reports and wrote a June 2007 
report “Sipping Fuel and Saving Lives:  Increasing Fuel Economy Without Sacrificing 
Safety.”31   NHTSA agrees with two of the three ICCT report findings.  We agree that 
fuel economy technologies exist that don’t affect safety.  We agree that reducing weight 
(on vehicles over 5, 000 lbs) can make certain vehicles less aggressive and reduce their 
weight and probably improve safety.  Many, but not all of the experts at the workshop, 
agreed with the last conclusion:  “Advanced technologies can decouple size from mass, 
creating important new possibilities for increasing fuel economy and safety without 
compromising functionality”.  We continue to believe, until someone demonstrates to the 
contrary with some kind of rigorous, scientific analysis, that reducing weight on smaller 
lighter vehicles will only make them more dangerous in single-vehicle crashes, because 
of fundamental physics.  
 
A study examined similar safety issues -  “The “Arms Race” on American Roads: The 
Effect of Sport Utility Vehicles and Pickup Trucks of Traffic Safety”, Michelle J. White, 
University of California San Diego, Journal of Law and Economics, Volume XLVII, 
October 2004.   The White paper finds that “When drivers shift from cars to light trucks 
or SUVS, each crash that involves fatalities from light truck or SUV occupants that is 
prevented comes at a cost of at least 4.3 additional crashes that involve deaths of car 
occupants, pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists.”     
 
The White study is an analysis of NHTSA’s National Automotive Sampling System, 
General Estimates System and, as such, looks at the fatality risk given that a crash

occurred.  However, it does not control for VMT (likelihood of a crash given a mile of 
driving).   Furthermore, the study does not address the safety of big cars vs. small cars or 
big LTVs versus small LTVs.  Whether overall safety would be improved by shifting 
sales from SUV and pickups to passenger cars depends on what size of passenger cars 
you shifted to (see the table above), if you shifted to small or very small passenger cars, 
overall safety would decrease.   
 
Another study examined the size/safety issues – “The Fatality Risks of Sports Utility 
Vehicles, Vans, and Pickups Relative to Cars”, Ted Gayer, Georgetown University, The 
Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, 28-2, 103-133, 2004.  This study finds that “Using a 
cross-sectional variation in snow depth as an instrument to determine VMT, the results 
suggest that light trucks are 2.63 to 4.00 times more likely to crash than cars.”  “…once 
one adjusts for the greater frequency of crashes by light trucks, the aggregate risk they 
pose substantially dominates the risk from cars.  Indeed a world of light trucks would 
lead to three to ten times more fatalities than a world of cars.”       
 
This study does not address the safety of big cars vs. small cars or big LTVs versus small 
LTVs.  This analysis using snow depth exaggerates the difference in crash frequency and 
fatality rates between passenger cars and light trucks.   Kahane’s study also adjusted the 
raw data for VMT, but we have used odometer readings by age of vehicle to control for 
VMT and found no such discrepancy in crash rates.  The table above from the Kahane 
study does not show light trucks having substantially higher fatality rates than passenger 
cars.    
 
A 2001 study by Dr. Leonard Evans,32 modeled the risk of driver fatality in car 1 in a 
head-on collision with car 2.  The equations in the report indicate that reducing the curb 
weight of car 1 would increase the risk to the driver of car 1, while reducing the curb 
weight of car 2 would decrease the risk to the driver of car 1.  However, the equations 
also indicate that reducing the wheelbase of either car increases the total risk to both 
drivers. 
 
In a 2004 SAE paper, Dr. Evans claimed that increasing the amount of lightweight 
materials in vehicle design can provide reduced occupant risk both in two-vehicle and 
single-vehicle crashes, and also reduce risk for occupants in other vehicles33.  However, 
he produced no analysis using real world data of vehicles with lightweight material to 
substantiate that claim34.

34  In NHTSA’s opinion, there are not enough vehicles made from lightweight material on the road to 
support an analysis using real world crash data.    
  
IV-16  
In an amicus brief, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety35stated “Crash safety 
should be a consideration in how the balance is struck between programs to improve air 
quality and our efforts to protect people in crashes.  Physics dictates that vehicle weight 
and size will always matter in a crash.  Research in the private, public, and nonprofit 
sectors have demonstrated the relationship between vehicle size and weight and crash 
injuries.  Simply put, Vermont’s regulation encourages production of smaller, lighter 
vehicles which will lead to increased traffic fatalities.”  IIHS discusses research by 
NHTSA and IIHS that have led to the conclusion that “Vehicle downsizing has 
compromised safety because in most cases, smaller and lighter vehicles are less 
protective of their occupants than larger, heavier vehicles.”  IIHS calculated the vehicle 
death rates by make model using driver deaths per million registered vehicle years, 
presented this data, and ranked them.  “None of the 15 vehicles with the lowest driver 
death rates were mini or small models. … Eleven of the 16 vehicles with the highest 
driver death rates were small cars and none were large or very large. … The pattern is 
unmistakable.  There is an inverse relationship between driver death rates and vehicle 
size…”        
 
Footprint and safety 
The impact of CAFE standards on motor vehicle and passenger safety has long been 
recognized as an integral part of the agency's process of determining maximum feasible 
average fuel economy.  The agency notes that there are no compelling studies that 
quantify the precise and separate effects of vehicle size and weight on safety, in part 
because there is a high degree of correlation between size and weight among vehicles 
now in widespread use.  The agency has determined that an attribute system based on 
footprint with the continuous function would minimize incentives for design changes that 
would reduce motor vehicle safety.  In a weight-based system, a manufacturer can add 
weight to a vehicle in order to take advantage of a category with a lower fuel economy 
target.  As discussed above, this up-weighting can have positive and negative safety 
implications, with possibly negative impacts for the fleet as a whole if weight is added to 
heavier light trucks.  A manufacturer could not as readily increase footprint as it could 
vehicle weight.   
 
In order to increase footprint, a manufacturer would have to either extend a vehicle’s 
track width, wheelbase, or both.  Maintaining and increasing track width should play a 
positive role in limiting rollover vulnerability, whereas maintaining and increasing 
wheelbase should play a positive role in improving handling – especially directional 
stability, which is crucial in preventing unintended off-road excursions that often lead to 
rollovers – and maximizing crush space (though total length is probably more closely 
correlated with crush space than is wheelbase).   
 
This is mentioned in Dr. Kahane’s response to safety studies submitted by Dynamic 
Research, Inc., by Marc Ross (University of Michigan) and Tom Wenzel (Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory), and submitted by William E. Wecker Associates.

Dr. Kahane wrote:   
”The objective of the NHTSA study was to calibrate the historical (MY 1991-99) 
relationships of vehicle mass and fatality risk, after controlling for driver 
age/gender, geographical location, and vehicle equipment.  In this type of 
analysis, “vehicle mass” incorporates not only the effects of mass per se but also 
the effects of many other size attributes that are historically and/or causally 
related to mass, such as wheelbase, track width and structural integrity.  (As 
vehicles get longer and wider, they almost always get heavier.) 
 
The study does not claim that mass per se is the specific factor that increases or 
decreases fatality risk (except in its role in determining the relative Delta V of two 
vehicles that collide).  On the contrary, Chapter 5 of the NHTSA report shows 
that certain 4,000-pound SUVs have significantly higher fatal-crash rates than 
3,500-pound cars.  The study only shows the historical relationship between mass 
– taking into account all the other size attributes that have typically varied with 
mass – and fatality risk, for vehicles of the same type.  If historical relationships 
between mass and other size attributes continue, in the absence of compelling 
reasons that would change those relationships, future changes in mass are likely to 
be associated with similar changes in fatality risk.  (However, the increased use of 
advanced restraint systems and sophisticated crash avoidance safety devices in 
recent and future production vehicles could have a noticeable impact on the 
historical relationship between vehicle mass and fatality risk in future vehicle 
fleets.)   
 
In that sense, it is irrelevant whether mass, wheelbase, track width or some other 
attribute is the principal causal factor on fatality risk.  If you decrease mass, you 
will also tend to reduce wheelbase, track width and other dimensions of size.  If 
manufacturers respond to this proposal by building lighter vehicles of constant 
size, the historical relationship between mass and safety would gradually 
weaken.” 
 
Changes in technology could influence the relationship between weight and size.  There 
is emerging evidence that vehicle weight can be reduced without reductions in size or 
safety through the use of high strength, lightweight materials.  Currently, we do not 
observe many vehicles built with lightweight materials in the historical data and therefore 
cannot separate the impact of size versus weight when lightweight materials are utilized.   
However, the impact of weight, whether it comes from reducing size or material 
substitution, will be the same for single vehicle impacts (rollovers and fixed and non-
fixed object impacts).     
 
Attribute-based standards eliminate the incentive for manufacturers to respond to CAFE 
standards in ways harmful to safety.36  Because each vehicle model has its own target

(based on the attribute chosen), attribute-based standards provide no incentive to build 
smaller vehicles simply to meet a fleet-wide average, because the smaller vehicles will be 
subject to more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets.

EPA Labeling Rule: Fuel Economy Labeling of Motor Vehicles: Revisions to 
Improve Calculation of Fuel Economy Estimates 
 
The EPA Fuel Economy Labeling Rule37 employs a new vehicle-specific, 5-cycle   
approach to calculating fuel economy labels which incorporates estimates of the fuel 
efficiency of each vehicle during high speed, aggressive driving, air conditioning 
operation and cold temperatures into each vehicle’s fuel economy label.  The rule became 
effective January 26, 2007, and will take effect starting with MY 2008. 
 
The new testing procedures will combine measured fuel economy over the two current 
fuel economy tests, the FTP and HFET, as well as that over the US06, SC03 and cold 
FTP tests into estimates of city and highway fuel economy for labeling purposes.  The 
test results from each cycle will be weighted to represent the contribution of each cycle’s 
attributes to on-road driving and fuel consumption.  The labeling rule does not alter the 
FTP and HFET driving cycles, the measurement techniques, or the calculation methods 
used to determine CAFE.    
 
The EPA Labeling Rule will not impact CAFE standards or test procedures or other U.S. 
Government regulations.38  Rather, the changes to existing test procedures will allow for 
the collection of appropriate fuel economy data to ensure that existing test procedures 
better represent real-world conditions.39  Further, the labeling rule does not have a direct 
effect upon a vehicle’s weight, nor on the fuel economy level that a vehicle can achieve.  
Instead, the labeling law serves to provide consumers with a more accurate estimate of 
fuel economy based on more comprehensive factors reflecting real-world driving use.  
For this PRIA, the agency assumes that on-road mileage will be 80 percent of the 
measured CAFE, based on the FTP and HFET driving cycles, the measurement 
techniques, and the calculation methods used to determine CAFE.

V.  FUEL ECONOMY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGIES AND THE VOLPE MODEL 
A.   Comparison of current with past approaches to analysis of technologies, their 
cost and effectiveness 
 
In the Agency’s last two rulemakings covering light truck CAFE standards for MYs 2005 
– 2007 and MYs 2008 – 2011, the agency relied on the 2002 National Academy of 
Sciences’ report, Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
Standards (“the 2002 NAS Report”)40 for estimating potential fuel economy benefits and 
associated retail costs of applying combinations of technologies in 10 classes of 
production vehicles.  The NAS cost and effectiveness numbers were the best available 
estimates at this time, determined by a panel of experts formed by the National Academy 
of Sciences, and the report had been peer reviewed by individuals chosen for their diverse 
perspectives and technical expertise in accordance with procedures approved by the 
Report Review Committee of the National Research Council.  However, since the 
publication of the 2002 NAS Report, there has been substantial advancement in fuel-
saving technologies, including technologies not discussed in the NAS Report that are 
expected to appear on vehicles in the MY 2011-2015 timeframe.  There also have been 
reports issued and studies conducted by several other organizations and companies that 
discuss fuel economy technologies and their benefits and costs.  NHTSA has contracted 
with the NAS to update the fuel economy section, Chapter 3, of the 2002 NAS Report.  
However, this update will not be available in time for this rulemaking.  Due to the 
expedited nature of this rulemaking, NHTSA, in consultation with the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), developed an updated technology cost and effectiveness list to 
be used in this notice. 
 
This list presents NHTSA and EPA technical staff’s current assessment of the costs and 
effectiveness from a broad range of technologies which can be applied to cars and light-
duty trucks. EPA published the results of this collaboration in a report and submitted it to 
the NAS committee41. A copy of the report and other studies used in the technology 
update will be placed in NHTSA’s docket.   
 
NHTSA believes that the estimates used for this notice, which rely on the best available 
public and confidential information, are defensible and reasonable predictions for the 
next five years. Nevertheless, NHTSA still believes that the ideal source for this 
information comes from a peer reviewed process such as the NAS.  NHTSA will 
continue to work with NAS to update this list on a five year interval as required by the 
Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  
  
The majority of the technologies discussed in this section are in production and available 
on vehicles today, either in the United States, Japan, or Europe. A number of the

duty Vehicle Carbon Dioxide Emissions. EPA420-R-08-008, March, 2008

technologies are commonly available, while others have only recently been introduced 
into the market. In a few cases, we provide estimates on technologies which are not 
currently in production, but are expected to be so in the next few years. These 
technologies which can be applied to cars and trucks that are capable of achieving 
significant improvements in fuel economy and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, 
and improve vehicle fuel economy, at reasonable costs.  
 
NHTSA and EPA conducted the technology examination using concepts from the 2002 
NAS report which constituted a starting point for the analysis. In the NAS Report, there 
were three exemplary technology paths or scenarios identified for each class of 
production vehicles, which lead to successively greater improvements in fuel 
consumption and greater costs.  Path I included production-intent technologies that will 
be available within 10 years and could be implemented under current economic and 
regulatory conditions.  Path II included more costly production-intent technologies that 
are technically feasible for introduction within 10 years if economic and regulatory 
conditions justify their use.  Path III included emerging technologies that will be 
available within 10 to 15 years but that may require further development prior to 
commercial introduction.  These three paths represented vehicle development steps that 
would offer increasing levels of fuel economy gains (as incremental gains) at 
incrementally increasing cost.  As stated earlier, since the publication of the 2002 NAS 
Report, automotive technology has continued to advance and many of the technologies 
that were identified in the report as emerging have already entered the marketplace.   
 
In this rulemaking, NHTSA working with EPA have examined a variety of technologies 
and looked beyond path I and path II to path III and to emerging technologies beyond 
path III.  These technologies were in their infancy when the 2002 NAS Report was being 
formulated.  In addition, unlike for past rulemakings where NHTSA projected the use of 
different variants of a technology as a combined technology, in this rulemaking, NHTSA 
working with EPA examined advanced forms and subcategories of existing technologies 
and reflected the effectiveness and cost for each of the variants separately for all ten 
vehicle classes.  The specific technologies affected are variable valve timing (VVT), 
variable valve lift and timing (VVLT) and cylinder deactivation.  Manufacturers are 
currently using many different types of VVTs and VVLTs, which have a variety of 
different names and methods.  This rulemaking employs specific cost and effectiveness 
estimates for variants of VVT, including Intake Camshaft Phasing (ICP), Coupled 
Camshaft Phasing (CCP), and Dual (Independent) Camshaft Phasing (DCP).  It also 
employs specific cost and effectiveness estimates for variants of VVLT, including 
Discrete Variable Valve Lift (DVVL) and Continuous Variable Valve Lift (CVVL).  We 
also now include the effectiveness and cost estimates for each of the variants of cylinder 
deactivation.  The most common type of cylinder deactivation is one in which an eight-
cylinder overhead valve engine disables four of its cylinders under light loads.   Cylinder 
deactivation could be incorporated on overhead cam engines, and can be applied to four 
and six cylinder engines as well (we have restricted application to 6 and 8 cylinder 
engines).  Thus, the variants of cylinder deactivation that now have specific cost and 
effectiveness estimates include both overhead valve engine cylinder deactivation and 
overhead cam engine cylinder deactivation.   
  
V-3  
 
The update also revisited technology lead time issues and took a fresh look at technology 
application rates, how to link certain technologies to certain redesign and refresh patterns, 
synergistic impacts resulting from adding technology packaging, and learning costs.  
 
1. Data sources for technology assumptions  
 
A large number of technical reports and papers are available which contain data and 
estimates of the fuel economy improvements of various vehicle technologies. In addition 
to specific peer-reviewed papers respecting individual technologies, we also utilized a 
number of recent reports which had been utilized by various State and Federal Agencies 
and which were specifically undertaken for the purpose of estimating future vehicle fuel 
economy reduction effectiveness or improvements in fuel economy. The reports we 
utilized most frequently were:  
 
• 2002 National Academy of Science (NAS) report titled "Effectiveness and Impact 
of Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards”. At the time it was published, the 
NAS report was considered by many to be the most comprehensive summary of 
current and future fuel efficiencies improvements which could be obtained by the 
application of individual technologies. The focus of this report was fuel economy, 
which can be directly correlated with CO2 emissions. The 2002 NAS report 
contains effectiveness estimates for ten different vehicle classifications (small car, 
mid-SUV, large truck, etc), but did not differentiate these effectiveness values 
across the classes. Where other sources or engineering principles indicated that a 
differentiation was warranted, we utilized the 2002 NAS effectiveness estimates 
as a starting point and further refined the estimate to one of the vehicle classes 
using engineering judgment or by consulting additional reliable sources. 
 
• 2004 Northeast States Center for a Clean Air Future (NESCCAF) report 
"Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Light-Duty Motor Vehicles". This 
report, which was utilized by the California Air Resources Board for their 2004 
regulatory action on vehicle CO2 emissions, includes a comprehensive vehicle 
simulation study undertaken by AVL, a world-recognized leader in automotive 
technology and engineering. In addition, the report included cost estimates 
developed by the Martec Group, a market-based research and consulting firm 
which provides services to the automotive industry. The NESCCAF report 
considered a number of technologies not examined in the 2002 NAS report. In 
addition, through the use of vehicle simulation modeling, the 2004 NESCCAF 
report provides a scientifically rigorous estimation of the synergistic impacts of 
applying multiple fuel economy technologies to a given vehicle. 
 
• 2006 Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc (EEA) report “Technology to 
Improve the Fuel Economy of Light Duty Trucks to 2015” Prepared for The U.S. 
Department of Energy and The U.S. Department of Transportation. This update of 
technology characteristics is based on new data obtained by EEA from technology 
suppliers and auto-manufacturers, and these data are compared to data from 
  
V-4  
studies conducted earlier by EEA, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the 
Northeast States Center for a Clean Air future (NESCCAF) and California Air 
Resources Board (CARB). 
 
• Data from Vehicle Manufacturers, Component Suppliers, and other reports. We 
also evaluated confidential data from a number of vehicle manufacturers as well 
as a number of technology component suppliers. In February of 2007, the NHTSA 
published a detailed Request for Comment (RFC) in the Federal Register. This 
RFC included, among other items, a request for information from automotive 
manufacturers and the public on the fuel economy improvement potential of a 
large number of vehicle technologies. The manufacturer’s submissions to this 
RFC were supplemented by confidential briefing and data provided by vehicle 
component suppliers, who for many of the technologies considered are the actual 
manufacturers of the specific technology and often undertake their own 
development and testing efforts to investigate the fuel economy improvement 
potential of their products.  Manufacturers that provided NHTSA and EPA with 
fuel economy cost and effectiveness estimates include BMW, Chrysler, Ford, 
General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen. The major suppliers 
that provided NHTSA with fuel economy cost and effectiveness estimates include 
Borg-Warner, Bosch, Corning, Delphi, and Siemens.   
 
• Finally, to verify that the fuel economy cost and effectiveness estimates for each 
of the technologies was reasonable and within currently available estimates for 
these technologies, NHTSA examined those estimates provided by other reports 
or sources, such as the Martec (contained in the 2004 NESCAFF report)  and 
Sierra Research reports42. 
 
2. Technologies and estimates of costs and effectiveness   
 
This section describes each technology and associated cost and effectiveness numbers.  
The technologies can be classified into five main groups similar to how they were 
classified in the NAS Report: engine technologies; transmission technologies; accessory 
technologies; vehicle technologies; and hybrid technologies.   
 
While NHTSA and EPA followed the general approach taken by the NAS in estimating 
the cost and effectiveness numbers, we decided to update some of these estimates to 
reflect better the changed marketplace and regulatory environment, as well as the 
advancement in and greater penetration of some production-intent and emerging 
technologies, which have led to lower costs.  The values contained in the 2002 NAS 
report were used to establish a baseline for the fuel economy cost and effectiveness 
estimates for each of the technologies.  We then examined all other estimates provided by 
manufacturers and major suppliers or other sources.  In examining these values, we gave 
                                                 
42 “Alternative and Future Technologies for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 
Road Vehicles” Sierra Research Report for Environment Canada, 1999 (SR99-07-01).

more weight to values or estimates provided by manufacturers that have already 
implemented these technologies in their fleet, especially those that have introduced them 
in the largest quantities.  Likewise, for technologies that have not penetrated the fleet to 
date, but will by early in the next decade (according to confidential manufacturer plans), 
we gave more weight to values or estimates provided by manufacturers that have stated 
that they will be introducing these technologies in their fleet, especially those that plan to 
introduce them in the largest quantities.  In addition, for the technologies that will appear 
on vehicles by early in the next decade, we carefully examined the values provided by 
those suppliers who have developed these technologies and may have contracts in place 
to provide them to manufacturers.  
 
Because not all technologies can be applied on all types of vehicles, engines or 
transmissions, we separately evaluated 10 classes of vehicles to estimate fuel economy 
cost and effectiveness for each of the technologies.  As discussed above, these ten 
classes, also used in NHTSA’s 2006 light truck CAFE rule, were derived from the 2002 
NAS Report, which estimated the feasibility, potential incremental fuel consumption 
benefit and the incremental cost of three product development paths for the following ten 
vehicle classes: subcompact passenger cars, compact passenger cars, midsize passenger 
cars, large passenger cars, small sport utility vehicles, midsize sport utility vehicles, large 
sport utility vehicles, small pickups, large pickups, and minivans. 
 
The application of technologies to a vehicle class is limited not only by whether the 
manufacturer is capable of applying it within a particular development cycle, but also by 
whether the technology may physically be applied to the vehicle.  For example, 
continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) were only allowed to be projected on 
vehicles with unibody construction, which includes all passenger cars and minivans and 
some small and midsize SUVs.  CVTs could not be projected for use on vehicles with 
ladder-frame construction, which includes all pickups and large SUVs and some small 
and midsize SUVs.  Another example is cylinder deactivation being limited to vehicles 
with 6- or 8-cylinder engines.  To simplify the analysis, NHTSA assumed that each class 
of vehicles would typically have vehicle construction and engines with a specific number 
of cylinders that is most representative of that vehicle class. 
 
Although we looked at ten vehicle classes separately, for some technologies the estimated 
incremental fuel consumption benefit and incremental cost were the same across all 
vehicle classes (as for engine accessory improvement), while for other technologies the 
estimated incremental fuel consumption benefit and incremental cost differed across 
classes (as for hybrid drivetrains).  The main difference was with which path(s) each 
technology was expected to be associated.  .  
 
The exact cost and benefit of a given technology depends on specific vehicle 
characteristics (size, weight, base engine, etc.) and the existence of additional 
technologies that were already applied to the vehicle.  In the section below, ranges of 
incremental cost and fuel consumption reduction values are listed where the values 
depend on vehicle characteristics and are independent of the order in which they are 
applied to a vehicle.  All costs, which are reflective of estimated retail price equivalents 
  
V-6  
(RPEs) were inflated by the producer price index (if needed) and are presented in year 
2006 dollars, because this is the last year for which final economic indexing is available.  
Some cost estimates are based on supplier costs.  In those instances, multipliers were 
included in those costs so that they would be treated in the same manner as cost estimates 
that are based on manufacturer costs.  These incremental values were calculated by 
subtracting out all same-path synergies associated with a given technology and any 
preceding items on the same path.  Essentially, the incremental percent reduction in fuel 
consumption and cost impacts represent improvements beyond the ones realized due to 
technologies already applied to the vehicle.  As an example, a 5-speed automatic 
transmission could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 2 to 3 percent at an 
incremental cost of $75 to $165 per vehicle, relative to a 4-speed automatic transmission.  
In turn, a 6-speed automatic transmission could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 4.5 to 6.5 percent at an incremental cost of $10 to $20 per vehicle, relative to a 5-
speed transmission. 
 
NHTSA acknowledges that this approach is different from the one it followed in 
establishing the reformed light truck standards for MYs 2008-2011, where we relied 
nearly exclusively on the 2002 NAS report’s estimates.  Our preference remains to rely 
upon peer-review and credible studies, such as the 2002 NAS report; however we believe 
that the estimates made by the joint EPA/NHTSA team are accurate and defensible.  The 
agency seeks comments on our assumptions and the cost, effectiveness and availability 
estimates provided.  NHTSA also seeks comments on whether the order in which these 
technologies was applied by the Volpe model is proper and whether we have accurately 
accounted for technologies already included on vehicles and whether we have accurately 
accounted for technologies that are projected to be applied to vehicles. The agency also 
seeks comments on the “synergy” factors (discussed below) it has applied in order to 
adjust the estimated incremental effectiveness of some pairs of technology and on 
whether similar adjustments to the estimated incremental cost of some technologies 
should be made.  In preparation for a final rule, NHTSA intends to update its technology-
related methodologies and estimates, and expects that these anticipated updates will 
affect the form and stringency of the final standards. 
 
a. Engine technologies 
 
Low-Friction Lubricants 
 
The use of lower viscosity engine and transmission lubricants can reduce fuel 
consumption.  More advanced multi-viscosity engine and transmission oils are now 
available with improved performance in a wider temperature band, with better lubricating 
properties. However, even without any changes to fuel economy standards, most MY 
2011-2015 vehicles are likely to use 5W-30 motor oil, and some will use even less 
viscous oils, such as 5W-20 or possibly even 0W-20 to reduce cold start friction.  This 
may directionally benefit the fuel economy improvements of valvetrain technologies such 
as cylinder deactivation, which rely on a minimum oil temperature (viscosity) for 
operation. Most manufacturers therefore attributed smaller potential fuel economy 
reductions and cost increases to lubricant improvements. 
  
V-7  
 
The NAS Report projected that low-friction lubricants could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1 percent at an incremental cost of $8 to $11.43  The NESCCAF study 
projected that low-friction lubricants could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 
percent at an incremental cost of $5 to $15; while the EEA report projected that low-
friction lubricants could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 percent at an 
incremental cost of $10 to $20.  In contrast, manufacturer data projected an estimated fuel 
consumption potential of 0% to 1% at an incremental cost that ranged from $1 to $11, 
with many of them stating the costs as ranging from $1 to $5.  NHTSA believes that these 
manufacturer estimates are more accurate and estimates that low-friction lubricants could 
reduce fuel consumption by 0.5 percent for all vehicle types at an incremental cost of $3, 
which represents the mid-point of $2.50, rounded up to the next dollar. 
 
Reduction of Engine Friction Losses 
 
All reciprocating and rotating components in the engine are candidates for friction 
reduction, and minute improvements in several components can add to a measurable fuel 
economy improvement.  The amount of energy an engine loses to friction can be reduced 
in a variety of ways.  Improvements in the design of engine components and subsystems 
will result in friction reduction, improved engine operation, greater fuel economy and 
reduced emissions.  Examples include low-tension piston rings, roller cam followers, 
crankshaft design, improved material coatings, material substitution, more optimal 
thermal management, piston surface treatments, and as lubricant friction reduction. 
Additionally, as computer-aided modeling software continues to improve, more 
opportunities for incremental friction reduction might become apparent.    Even without 
any changes to fuel economy standards, most MY 2010-2015 vehicles are likely to 
employ one or more such techniques to reduce engine friction and other mechanical and 
hydrodynamic losses.   
 
The NAS Report predicted that such technologies could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1 to 5 percent at an incremental cost of $36 to $146.   NESCCAF 
predicted that such technologies could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 0.5 
percent at an incremental cost of $5 to $15; while the EEA report predicted that such 
technologies could reduce fuel consumption at an incremental cost of $10 to $55. 
Confidential manufacturer data indicates that engine friction reduction could 
incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $0 to 
$168.  Based on available information from these reports and confidential manufacturer 
data, NHTSA estimates that friction reduction could reduce fuel consumption for all 
vehicles by 1 to 3 percent at a cost of $21 per cylinder.  Thus, the incremental cost of 
engine friction reduction for a 4-cylinder engine is $0 to $84 (applicable to subcompact 
and compact cars); for a 6-cylinder engine is $0 to $126 (applicable to midsize cars, large 
cars, small pickups, small SUVs, minivans and midsize SUVs); and for an 8-cylinder 
engine is $0 to $168 (applicable to large pickups and SUVs). 
 
                                                 
43  The price increases noted in this chapter are slightly higher than shown in the NAS study, since they 
have been converted into calendar year 2006 prices.   
  
V-8  
Multi-Valve Overhead Camshaft Engine 
 
It appears likely that many vehicles would still use overhead valve (OHV) engines with 
pushrods and one intake and one exhaust valve per cylinder during the early part of the 
next decade.  Engines with overhead cams (OHC) and more than two valves per cylinder 
achieve increased airflow at high engine speeds and reductions of the valve train’s 
moving mass and enable central positioning of spark plugs.  Such engines, which are 
already used in some light trucks, typically develop higher power at high engine speeds.  
The NAS Report projected that multi-valve OHC engines could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 2 percent to 5 percent at an incremental cost of $109 to $146, and 
NHTSA found no sources to update these projections. 
 
For purposes of this rule, OHV engines and OHC engines were considered separately, and the 
model was generally not allowed to apply multivalve OHC technology to OHV engines, except 
where continuous variable valve timing and lift (CVVL) is applied to OHV engines.  In that 
case, the model assumes conversion to DOHC valvetrain, because DOHC valvetrains are 
prerequisites for the application of any advanced engine technology over and above CVVL.  
Since applying CVVL to an OHV is the last improvement that could be made to such an 
engine, it’s logical to assume that manufacturers would redesign that engine as a DOHC and 
include CVVL as part of that redesign.  
 
For 4-cylinder engines we estimated that the cost to redesign an OHV engine as a DOHC 
that includes CVVL would be $599 ($169 for conversion to DVVL, $254 for conversion 
to CVVL, and $176 for conversion to DOHC, which comprises an additional camshaft 
and valves), with estimated fuel consumption reduction of 2 to 3 percent. For 6-cylinder 
engines we estimated that the cost to redesign an OHV engine as a DOHC that includes 
CVVL would be $1262 ($246 for conversion to DVVL, $488 for conversion to CVVL, 
and $550 for conversion to DOHC, which comprises an additional camshaft and valves), 
with estimated fuel consumption reduction of 1 to 4 percent. For 8-cylinder engines we 
estimated that the cost to redesign an OHV engine as a DOHC that includes CVVL 
would be $1380 ($322 for conversion to DVVL, $508 for conversion to CVVL, and $550 
for conversion to DOHC, which comprises an additional camshaft and valves), with 
estimated fuel consumption reduction of 2 to 3 percent.  Incremental cost estimates for 
DVVL and CVVL are discussed below. 
 
NHTSA believes that the NESCCAF report and confidential manufacturer data are more 
accurate, and thereby estimates that a conversion of an OHV engine to a DOHC engine with 
CVVL could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 4 percent at an incremental cost of 
$599 to $1,380 compared to an OHV with VVT. 
 
Cylinder Deactivation 
 
For the vast majority of vehicles, each cylinder is always active while the engine is 
running.  Under partial load conditions, the engine’s specific fuel consumption could be 
reduced if some cylinders could be disabled, such that the active cylinders operate at 
higher load.  In cylinder deactivation, some (usually half) of the cylinders are “shut 
  
V-9  
down” during light load operation – the valves are kept closed, and no fuel is injected – 
as a result, the trapped air within the deactivated cylinders is simply compressed and 
expanded as an air spring, with minimal friction and heat losses.  The active cylinders 
combust at almost double the load required if all of the cylinders were operating.  
Pumping losses are significantly reduced as long as the engine is operated in this “part-
cylinder” mode. 
 
The theoretical engine operating region for cylinder deactivation is limited to no more 
than roughly 50% of peak power at any given engine speed. In practice, however, 
cylinder deactivation is employed primarily at lower engine cruising loads and speeds, 
where the transitions in and out of deactivation mode are less apparent to the operator and 
where the noise and vibration (NVH) associated with fewer firing cylinders may be less 
of an issue. Manufacturers are exploring the possibilities of increasing the amount of time 
that part-cylinder mode might be suitable to a vehicle with more refined powertrain and 
NVH treatment strategies. 
 
General Motors and Chrysler Group have incorporated cylinder deactivation across a 
substantial portion of their V8-powered lineups. Honda (Odyssey, Pilot) and General 
Motors (Impala, Monte Carlo) offer V6 models with cylinder deactivation.  
 
There are two variants of cylinder deactivation. The most common type of cylinder 
deactivation is one in which an eight-cylinder overhead valve engine disables four 
cylinders under light loads.   Thus an eight-cylinder engine could disable four cylinders 
under light loads, such as when the vehicle is cruising at highway speed.  This technology 
could be applied to four and six cylinder engines as well.  General Motors and Chrysler 
Group have incorporated cylinder deactivation across a substantial portion of their V8-
powered overhead valve lineups. 
 
Cylinder deactivation could be incorporated on overhead cam engines and can be applied 
to four and six cylinder engines as well.  Honda has already begun offering three V6 
models with cylinder deactivation (Accord, Odyssey, and Pilot) and GM will soon release 
cylinder deactivation on its 3.9L 6-cylinder engine.  Fuel economy improvement 
potential scales roughly with engine displacement-to-vehicle weight ratio: the higher 
displacement-to-weight vehicles, operating at lower relative loads for normal driving, 
have the potential to operate in part-cylinder mode more frequently. 
 
Honda’s technology includes the use of active engine mounts and noise damping amongst 
other items added to its V6 engines with cylinder deactivation.  This, of course increases 
the cost relative to a four or eight cylinder OHC engine.  
 
Some manufacturers are getting results in excess of 6 percent and most are at the high 
end of the range.  This higher number is supported by official fuel economy test data on a 
V6 Honda Odyssey with cylinder deactivation compared to the same vehicle (and engine 
displacement) without cylinder deactivation and by confidential manufacturer 
information.   
 
  
V-10  
The NAS Report projected that cylinder deactivation could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 3 percent to 6 percent at an incremental cost of $112 to $252. The 
NESCCAF study projected that cylinder deactivation could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1.7 percent to 4.2 percent at an incremental cost of $161 to $210; while 
the EEA report projected that cylinder deactivation could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 5.2 percent to 7.2 percent at an incremental cost of $105 to $135. 
Confidential manufacturer data and official fuel economy test data indicates that cylinder 
deactivation could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by at least 6 percent at an 
incremental cost of $203 to $229.   NHTSA believes that these manufacturer estimates 
are more accurate and thus estimates that cylinder deactivation could reduce fuel 
consumption by 4.5 percent to 6 percent at an incremental cost of $203 to $229. 
 
Variable Valve Timing 
 
Variable valve timing is a classification of valvetrain designs that alter the timing of the 
intake valve, exhaust valve, or both, primarily to reduce pumping losses, increase specific 
power, and control residual gases.  VVT reduces pumping losses when the engine is 
lightly loaded by positioning the valve at the optimum position needed to sustain 
horsepower and torque.  VVT can also improve thermal efficiency at higher engine 
speeds and loads.  Additionally, VVT can be used to alter (and optimize) the effective 
compression ratio where it is advantageous for certain engine operating modes. 
 
Variable valve timing has been available in the market for quite a while. By the early 
1990s, VVT had made a significant market penetration with the arrival of Honda’s 
“VTEC” line of engines. VVT has now become a widely adopted technology: for the 
2007 model year, over half of all new cars and light trucks have engines with some 
method of variable valve timing.  Therefore, the degree of further improvement across 
the fleet is limited to vehicles that have not already implemented this technology. 
 
Manufacturers are currently using many different types of variable valve timing, which 
have a variety of different names and methods.  The major types of VVT are listed 
below: 
 
Intake Camshaft Phasing (ICP)  
 
Valvetrains with ICP – the simplest type of cam phasing - can modify the timing of the 
intake valve while the exhaust valve timing remains fixed.  This requires the addition of a 
cam phaser for each bank of intake valves on the engine. An in-line 4-cylinder engine has 
one bank of intake valves, while V-configured engines would have two banks of intake 
valves. The NAS Report projected that ICP could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 3 percent to 6 percent at an incremental cost of $35; while the EEA report projected 
that ICP could reduce fuel consumption at an incremental cost of $35. The NESCCAF 
study projected that ICP could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 percent to 2 
percent at an incremental cost of $49.  Consistent with the EEA report and NESCCAF 
study, we have used this $35 manufacturer cost to arrive at incremental cost of $59 per 
cam phaser or $59 for an in-line 4 cylinder and $119 for a V-type, thus NHTSA estimates 
  
V-11  
that ICP could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 2 percent at an incremental 
cost of $59 to $119 above fixed-cam valvetrains. 
 
Coupled Camshaft Phasing (CCP)  
 
Coupled (or coordinated) cam phasing is a design in which both the intake and exhaust 
valve timing are varied with the same cam phaser.  For an overhead cam engine, the same 
phaser added for ICP would be used for CCP control.  As a result, its costs should be 
identical to those for ICP.  For an overhead valve engine, only one phaser would be 
required for both inline and V-configured engines since only one camshaft exists. 
Therefore, for overhead valve engines, the cost is estimated at $59 regardless of engine 
configuration, using the logic provided for ICP. 
 
The NESCCAF study projected that CCP could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 1 percent to 3 percent above that obtained by ICP.  Confidential manufacturer data 
also projects that that CCP could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 percent to 3 
percent above that obtained by ICP.  According to the NESCCAF report and confidential 
manufacturer data, NHTSA estimates that CCP could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $59 to $119. 
 
Dual (Independent) Camshaft Phasing (DCP) 
 
The most flexible VVT design is dual cam phasing, where the intake and exhaust valve 
opening and closing events are controlled independently.  This design allows the option 
of controlling valve overlap, which can be used as an internal EGR strategy.  Our 
estimated incremental compliance cost for this technology is built upon that for VVT-ICP 
where an additional cam phaser is added to control each bank of exhaust valves less the 
cost to the manufacturer of the removed EGR valve. The incremental compliance cost for 
a 4-cylinder engine is estimated to be $59 for each bank of valves, plus an estimated 
piece cost of $30 for the valves, for a total incremental compliance cost of $89. The 
incremental compliance cost for a V6 or a V8 engine is estimated to be $59 for each bank 
of intake valves (i.e., two banks times $59/bank = $119), $59 for each bank of exhaust 
valves (i.e., another $119) minus an estimated $29 incremental compliance cost for the 
removed EGR valve; the total incremental compliance cost being $209.   
 
According to the NESCCAF report and confidential manufacturer data, it is estimated 
that DCP could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 3 percent at an 
incremental cost of $89 to $209 compared to engines with ICP or CCP.  
 
Because ICP and CCP have the same cost and similar effectiveness, it is assumed that 
manufacturers will choose the technology that best fits the specific engine architecture 
and application. 
 
Variable Valve Lift and Timing 
 
  
V-12  
Some vehicles have engines for which both valve timing and lift can be at least partially 
optimized based on engine operating conditions.  Engines with variable valve timing and 
lift (VVLT) can achieve further reductions in pumping losses and further increases in 
thermal efficiency.  Controlling the lift height of the valves provides additional flexibility 
and potential for further fuel consumption reduction. By reducing the valve lift, engines 
can decrease the volumetric flow at lower operating loads, improving fuel-air mixing and 
in-cylinder mixture motion which results in improved thermodynamic efficiency and also 
potentially reduced overall valvetrain friction. Also, by moving the throttling losses 
further downstream of the throttle valve, the heat transfer losses that occur from the 
throttling process are directed into the fresh charge-air mixture just prior to compression, 
delaying the onset of knock-limited combustion processes. At the same time, such 
systems may also incur increased parasitic losses associated with their actuation 
mechanisms. 
 
The NAS report projected that VVLT could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 
to 2 percent over VVT alone at an incremental cost of $73 to 218. 
 
Manufacturers are currently using many different types of variable valve lift and timing, 
which have a variety of different names and methods.  The major types of VVLT are 
listed below: 
 
Discrete Variable Valve Lift 
 
Discrete variable valve lift (DVVL) is a method in which the valvetrain switches between 
multiple cam profiles, usually 2 or 3, for each valve.  These cam profiles consist of a low 
and a high-lift lobe, and may include an inert or blank lobe to incorporate cylinder 
deactivation (in the case of a 3-step DVVL system).  According to the NESCCAF report 
and confidential manufacturer data, it is estimated that DVVL could incrementally reduce 
fuel consumption by 0.5 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $169 to $322 compared to 
an engine with VVT and cylinder deactivation depending on engine size and overhead 
cam versus overhead valve engines. Included in this cost estimate is $25 for controls and 
associated oil supply needs (these costs not reflected in the NESCCAF study). We also 
project that a single valve lifter could control valve pairs, thus engines with dual intake 
and/or dual exhaust valves would require only one lifter per pair of valves. Due to this, 
the estimated costs for applying DVVL to overhead cam and overhead valve engines are 
the same.  
 
Continuous Variable Valve Lift 
 
Continuous variable valve lift (CVVL) employs a mechanism that varies the pivot point 
in the rocker arm.  This design is realistically limited to overhead cam engines.  
Currently, BMW has implemented this type of system in its Valvetronic engines, which 
employs fully flexible valve timing to allow an extra set of rocker arms to vary the valve 
lift height.  CVVL enables intake valve throttling in engines, which allows for the use of 
more complex systems of sensors and electronic controls to enable further optimization 
of valve lift.   
  
V-13  
 
The NESCCAF study projected incremental costs from $210 to $420, depending on 
vehicle class, while the EEA report projected incremental costs of $180 to $350, 
depending on vehicle class. Confidential manufacturer data projects that CVVL could 
incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1.5 by 4 percent at an incremental cost of $200 
to $515.  NHTSA believes that these manufacturer estimates are more accurate than 
NESCCAF estimates, thus it gives more weight to them. According to the NESCCAF 
report and confidential manufacturer data, NHTSA estimates that CVVL could 
incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1.5 by 4 percent at an incremental cost of $254 
to $508 compared to an engine with VVT and cylinder deactivation with cost estimates 
varying from $254, $466, and $508 for a 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder engine, respectively. 
 
Camless Valve Actuation 
 
Camless valve actuation relies on electromechanical actuators instead of camshafts to 
open and close the cylinder valves. When electromechanical actuators are used to replace 
cams and coupled with sensors and microprocessor controls, valve timing and lift can be 
optimized over all conditions.  An engine valvetrain that operates independently of any 
mechanical means provides the ultimate in flexibility for intake and exhaust timing and 
lift optimization.  With it comes infinite valve overlap variability, the rapid response 
required to change between operating modes (such as HCCI and GDI), intake valve 
throttling, cylinder deactivation, and elimination of the camshafts (reduced friction). This 
level of control can enable even further incremental reductions in fuel consumption.   
 
Camless valvetrains have been under research for many decades due to the design 
flexibility and the attractive fuel economy improvement potential they might provide. 
Despite the promising features of camless valvetrains, significant challenges remain. 
High costs and design complexity have reduced manufacturers’ enthusiasm for camless 
engines in light of other competing valvetrain technologies. The advances in VVT, 
VVLT, and cylinder deactivation systems demonstrated in recent years have reduced the 
potential efficiency advantage of camless valvetrains. 
 
The NAS Report projected that camless valve actuation could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 5 to 10 percent over VVLT at an incremental cost of $336 to $673.  
Confidential manufacturer information provides incremental fuel consumption losses that 
range from 2 to 10 percent at costs that range from $300 to $1,100.  The NESCCAF 
study projected that camless valve actuation could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 11 to 13 percent at an incremental cost of $805 to $1,820; while the EEA report 
projected that camless valve actuation could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 
10 to 14 percent at an incremental cost of $210 to $600.  These benefits and costs are 
believed to be incremental to engines with VVT. 
 
In reviewing our sources for costs, we have determined that the adjusted costs presented 
in the 2002 NAS study, which ranged from $336 to $673 - depending on vehicle class – 
represent the best available estimates.   Subtracting out the improvements associated with 
  
V-14  
the application of VVLT provides an estimated fuel consumption reduction of 2.5 
percent. 
 
Stoichiometric Gasoline Direct Injection Technology 
 
Gasoline direct injection (GDI, or SIDI) engines inject fuel at high pressure directly into 
the combustion chamber (rather than the intake port in port fuel injection).  Direct 
injection improves cooling of the air/fuel charge within the cylinder, which allows for 
higher compression ratios and increased thermodynamic efficiency.  Injector design 
advances and increases in fuel pressure have promoted better mixing of the air and fuel, 
enhancing combustion rates, increasing exhaust gas tolerance and improving cold start 
emissions. GDI engines achieve higher power density and match well with other 
technologies, such as boosting and variable valvetrain designs. 
 
Several manufacturers (Audi, BMW, and Volkswagen) have recently released GDI 
engines while General Motors and Toyota will be introducing GDI engines.  In addition, 
BMW and GM have announced their plans to dramatically increase the number of GDI 
engines in their portfolios. 
 
The NESCCAF report projected that the incremental cost for GDI of $189 to $294; while 
the EEA report projected an incremental cost of $77 to $135.  Confidential manufacturer 
data provides data with higher upper end costs than these estimates, with incremental fuel 
consumption estimates ranging from 1 to 2 percent. For our analysis, we have estimated 
the costs of individual components of a GDI system and used a “bottom up” approach 
looking at incremental costs for injectors, fuel pumps, etc., to arrive at system 
incremental compliance costs ranging from $122 to $420 for small cars and up to $228 to 
$525 for large trucks. The lower end of the ranges represent our best estimate 
using a bottom up approach while the upper end of the ranges represent levels more 
consistent with the manufacturer CBI submittals. As a result, we estimate that 
stoichiometric GDI could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 2 percent at an 
incremental cost of $122 to $525 compared to engines of similar power output. 
 
Gasoline Engine Turbocharging and Engine Downsizing 
The specific power of a naturally aspirated engine is limited, in part, by the rate at which 
the engine is able to draw air into the combustion chambers.  Turbocharging and 
supercharging are two methods to increase the intake manifold pressure and 
cylinder charge-air mass above naturally aspirated levels. By increasing the pressure 
differential between the atmosphere and the charging cylinders, superchargers and 
turbochargers increase this available airflow, and thus increase the specific power level, 
and with it the ability to reduce engine size while maintaining performance. This 
effectively reduces the pumping losses at lighter loads in comparison to a larger, naturally 
aspirated engine, while at the same time reducing net friction losses.   
 
Almost every major manufacturer currently markets a vehicle with some form of 
boosting.  While boosting has been a common practice for increasing performance for 
several decades, it has considerable fuel economy potential when the engine displacement 
  
V-15  
is reduced.  Specific power levels for a boosted engine often exceed 100 hp/L - compared 
to average naturally aspirated engine power densities of roughly 70 hp/L. As a result, 
engines can conservatively be downsized roughly 30 percent to achieve similar peak 
output levels. 
 
In the last decade, improvements to turbine design have improved their reliability and 
performance across the entire engine operating range.  New variable geometry turbines 
spool up to speed faster (eliminating the once-common “turbo lag”) while maintaining 
high flow rates for increased boost at high speeds. 
 
Turbocharging and downsizing involves the addition of a boost system, removal of two 
cylinders in most cases (from an 8-cylinder to a 6, or a 6 to a 4) and associated valves, 
and the addition of some form of cold start control system (e.g., air injection) to address 
possible cold start emission control. The NAS Report projected that turbocharging and 
downsizing could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 5 to 7 percent at an 
incremental cost of $364 to $582. The EEA report projected turbocharging and 
downsizing could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 5.2 to 7.8 percent. 
 
In developing estimated costs for turbocharging and downsizing an engine, NHTSA, in 
conjunction with EPA, relied upon piece cost estimates contained in the NESCCAF 
report.  The cost estimates provided by the NESCCAF report are as follows: $600 for the 
turbocharger and associated parts; $90 for an air injection pump and associated parts 
(each turbocharger requires an air injection pump); $75 per cylinder and associated 
components: $15 per each valve and associated components; and $150 per camshaft.  
 
In developing the cost estimates for each of the ten classes of vehicles, we determined the 
most logical type of downsizing that would occur for each class and starting with the 
turbocharger and air injector cost, either added or deleted cost, depending on the 
situation.  These cost estimates are incremental to an engine with GDI. For subcompact 
and compact cars, we determined that the downsizing wouldn’t involve the removal of 
any cylinders, valves and camshafts, but instead would result in a manufacturer using a 
smaller displacement 4-cylinder engine and adding the turbocharger and the air injector 
to the smaller engine.  Thus, for subcompact and compact cars, we estimated the cost of 
turbocharging and downsizing to be $690 ($600 for the turbocharger plus $90 for the air 
injector). 
 
For large trucks and large SUVs we determined that the most logical engine downsizing 
would involve replacing an 8-cylinder overhead valve engine with a turbocharged 6-
cylinder dual overhead cam engine. This change would result in the removal of 2 
cylinders, and the addition of a turbocharger, an air injector, 8 valves and 2 camshafts. 
Thus, for, we have estimated the cost of turbocharging and downsizing to be $810 ($600 
for the turbocharger plus $90 for the air injector, plus $120 for eight valves plus $150 for 
a camshaft and minus $150 for the removal of two cylinders).  
 
For midsize cars, large cars, small trucks, small SUVs, midsize SUVs and minivans, we 
determined that the most logical engine downsizing would involve replacing a 6-cylinder 
  
V-16  
dual overhead cam engine with a turbocharged 4-cylinder dual overhead cam engine.  
This change would result in the removal of 2 cylinders, 8 valves and 2 camshafts and the 
addition of a turbocharger and air injector. Thus, for, we have estimated the cost of 
turbocharging and downsizing to be $120 ($600 for the turbocharger plus $90 for the air 
injector, minus $150 for the removal of two cylinders, minus $120 for the removal of 
eight valves and minus $300 for the removal of two camshafts). 
 
Thus, we have estimated the cost for a boosted/downsized engine system at $690 for 
small cars, $810 for large trucks, and $120 for other vehicle classes. Projections of the 
fuel consumption reduction potential of a turbocharged and downsized engine from the 
NAS Report are backed by EEA estimates and confidential manufacturer data. .  
According to the NAS Report, the EEA report, cost estimates developed in conjunction 
with EPA and confidential manufacturer data, NHTSA estimates that downsized 
turbocharged engines could incrementally reduce fuel consumption from 5 to 7.5 percent 
at an incremental cost of $120 to $810. 
 
Diesel Engine 
 
Diesel engines have several characteristics that give them superior fuel efficiency to 
conventional gasoline, spark-ignited engines.  Pumping losses are greatly reduced due to 
lack of (or greatly reduced) throttling.  The diesel combustion cycle operates at a higher 
compression ratio, with a very lean air/fuel mixture, and typically at much higher torque 
levels than an equivalent-displacement gasoline engine.  Turbocharged light-duty diesels 
typically achieve much higher torque levels at lower engine speeds than equivalent-
displacement naturally-aspirated gasoline engines. Additionally, diesel fuel has higher 
energy content per gallon.  However, diesel engines have emissions characteristics that 
present challenges to meeting Tier 2 emissions standards. 
 
Compliance strategies are expected to include a combination of combustion 
improvements and after-treatment.  Several key advances in diesel technology have made 
it possible to reduce emissions coming from the engine (prior to after-treatment).  These 
technologies include improved fuel systems (higher pressures and more responsive 
injectors), advanced controls and sensors to optimize combustion and emissions 
performance, higher EGR levels to reduce NOx, lower compression ratios and advanced 
turbocharging systems. 
 
For after-treatment, the traditional 3-way catalyst found on gasoline-powered vehicles is 
ineffective due to the lean-burn combustion of a diesel.  All diesels will require a 
particulate filter, an oxidation catalyst, and a NOx reduction strategy to comply with Tier 
2 emissions standards.   
The NOx reduction strategies most common are outlined below: 
 
Lean NOx Trap Catalyst After-Treatment 
 
A lean NOx trap (LNT) operates, in principle, by storing NOx (NO and NO2) when the 
engine is running in its normal (lean) state.  When the control system determines (via 
  
V-17  
mathematical model or a NOx sensor) that the trap is saturated with NOx, it switches to a 
rich operating mode.  This rich mode produces excess hydrocarbons that act as a reducing 
agent to convert the stored NOx to N2 and water, thereby “regenerating” the LNT and 
opening up more locations for NOx to be stored.  LNTs are sensitive to sulfur deposits 
which can reduce catalytic performance, but periodically undergo a desulfation engine 
operating mode to clean it of sulfur buildup. 
 
According to confidential manufacturer data, NHTSA estimates that LNT-based diesels 
can incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 8 to 15 percent at an incremental cost of 
$1,500 to $1,600 compared to a direct injected turbocharged and downsized internal 
combustion engine. These costs are based on a “bottom up” cost analysis that was 
performed with EPA which then subtracted the costs of all previous steps on the decision 
tree prior to diesel engines. 
 
Selective Catalytic Reduction NOx After-Treatment 
 
SCR uses a reductant (typically, ammonia derived from urea) continuously injected into 
the exhaust stream ahead of the SCR catalyst.  Ammonia combines with NOx in the SCR 
catalyst to form N2 and water.  The hardware configuration for an SCR system is more 
complicated that that of an LNT, due to the onboard urea storage and delivery system 
(which requires a urea pump and injector into the exhaust stream).  While there is no 
required rich engine operating mode prescribed for NOx reduction, the urea is typically 
injected at a rate of 3 to 4 percent of that of fuel consumed.  Manufacturers designing 
SCR systems are intending to align urea tank refills with standard maintenance practices 
such as oil changes.  Incremental fuel consumption reduction estimates for diesel engines 
with an SCR system range from 11 to 20 percent at an incremental cost of $2,051 to 
$2,411 compared to a direct injected turbocharged and downsized internal combustion 
engine.  These costs are based on a “bottom up” cost analysis that was performed with 
EPA, which then subtracted the costs of all previous steps on the decision tree prior to 
diesel engines. 
 
Based on public information and on recent discussions that NHTSA and EPA have had 
with auto manufacturers and aftertreatment device manufacturers, NHTSA has received 
strong indications that LNT systems would probably be used on smaller vehicles while 
the SCR systems would be used on larger vehicles and trucks.  The primary reason given 
for this choice is the trade off between the rhodium needed for the LNT and the urea 
injection system needed for SCR. The breakeven point between these two cost factors 
appears to occur around 3.0 liters.  Thus, it is believed that it is cheaper to manufacturer 
diesel engines smaller than 3.0 liters with an LNT system, and that conversely, it is 
cheaper to manufacturer diesel engines larger than 3.0 liters with a SCR system.  Of 
course, there are other factors that influence a manufacturer’s decision on which system 
to use, but we have used this rule-of thumb for our analysis. 
 
b.   Transmission technologies 
 
Five-, Six-, Seven- and Eight-Speed Automatic Transmissions 
  
V-18  
 
The number of available transmission speeds influences the width of gear ratio spacing 
and overall coverage and, therefore, the degree of transmission ratio optimization 
available under different operating conditions.  In general, transmissions can offer a 
greater available degree of engine optimization and can therefore achieve higher fuel 
economy when the number of gears is increased.  However, potential gains may be 
reduced by increases in transmission weight and rotating mass.  Regardless of possible 
changes to fuel economy standards, manufacturers are increasingly introducing 5- and 6-
speed automatic transmissions on their vehicles.  Additionally, some manufacturers are 
introducing 7- and 8-speed automatic transmissions, with 7-speed automatic 
transmissions appearing with increasing frequency. 
 
Automatic 5-speed Transmissions 
 
As automatic transmissions have been developed over the years, more forward speeds 
have been added to improve fuel efficiency and performance.  Increasing the number of 
available ratios provides the opportunity to optimize engine operation under a wider 
variety of vehicle speeds and load conditions.  Also, additional gears allow for overdrive 
ratios (where the output shaft of the transmission is turning at a higher speed than the 
input shaft) which can lower the engine speed at a given road speed (provided the engine 
has sufficient power at the lower rpm point) to reduce pumping losses.  However, 
additional gears can add weight, rotating mass, and friction.  Nevertheless, manufacturers 
are increasingly adding 5-speed automatic transmissions to replace 3- and 4-speed 
automatic transmissions. 
 
The 2002 NAS study projected that 5-speed automatic transmissions could incrementally 
reduce fuel consumption by 2 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $76 to $167.  The 
NESCCAF study projected that 5-speed automatic transmissions could incrementally 
reduce fuel consumption by 1 percent at an incremental cost of $140; while the EEA 
report projected that 5-speed automatic transmissions could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 2 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $130.  Confidential manufacturer 
data projected that 5-speed automatic transmissions could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1 to 6 percent at an incremental cost of from $60 to $281. NHTSA 
believes that the NAS study’s estimates are still valid and estimates that 5-speed 
automatic transmissions could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 2.5 percent at 
an incremental cost of $76 to $167 (relative to a 4-speed automatic transmission). 
 
Automatic 6-, 7- and 8-speed Transmissions 
 
In addition to 5-speed automatic transmissions, manufacturers can also choose to utilize 
6-, 7-, or 8-speed automatic transmissions.  Additional ratios allow for further 
optimization of engine operation over a wider range of conditions, but this is subject to 
diminishing returns as the number of speeds increases.  As additional planetary gearsets 
are added (which may be necessary in some cases to achieve the higher number of ratios), 
additional weight and friction are introduced. Also, the additional shifting of such a 
transmission can be perceived as bothersome to some consumers, so manufacturers need 
  
V-19  
to develop strategies for smooth shifts. Some manufacturers are replacing 4-speed 
automatics with 6-speed automatics (there are also increasing numbers of 5-speed 
automatic transmissions that are being replaced by 6-speed automatic transmissions), and 
7-, and 8-speed automatics have entered production, albeit in lower-volume applications.   
 
The NAS study projected that 6-, 7- or 8-speed transmissions could incrementally reduce 
fuel consumption by 1 to 2 percent at an incremental cost of $70 to $126. Confidential 
manufacturer data projected that 6-, 7- or 8-speed transmissions could incrementally 
reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $20 to $120.  
However, according to the EEA report, a Lepelletier gear set design provides for 6-
speeds at the same cost as a 5-speed automatic. Based on that analysis, we have estimated 
the cost of a 6-speed automatic to be equivalent to that for a 5-speed automatic. We have 
not developed any estimate costs for 7- or 8-speed transmissions because of the 
diminishing returns in efficiency versus the costs for transmissions beyond 6-speeds.    
NHTSA estimates that 6-, 7-, or 8-speed automatic transmissions could incrementally 
reduce fuel consumption by 0.5 to 2.5 percent at an incremental cost of $0 to $20 
(relative to a 5-speed automatic transmission).  We are estimating up to an additional $20 
in costs because we have tried to account for the engineering effort in addition to the 
hardware which we believe the EEA did not and we wanted to capture some of the higher 
costs reported by manufacturers. 
 
Aggressive Shift Logic 
 
In operation, an automatic transmission’s controller decides when to upshift or downshift 
based on a variety of inputs such as vehicle speed and throttle position according to 
programmed logic.  Aggressive shift logic (ASL) can be employed so that a transmission 
is engineered in such a way as to maximize fuel efficiency by upshifting earlier and 
inhibiting downshifts under some conditions.  Through partial lock-up under some 
operating conditions and early lock-up under others, automatic transmissions can achieve 
some reduction in overall fuel consumption.  Aggressive shift logic is applicable to all 
vehicle types with automatic transmissions, and since in most cases it would require no 
significant hardware modifications, it can be adopted during vehicle redesign or refresh 
or even in the middle of a vehicle’s product cycle. The application of this technology 
does, however, require a manufacturer to confirm that driveability, durability, and noise, 
vibration, and harshness (NVH) are not significantly degraded. 
 
The NAS study projected that aggressive shift logic could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1 to 2 percent at an incremental cost of $0 to $70.  Confidential 
manufacturer data projected that aggressive shift logic could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 0.5 to 3 percent at an incremental cost of $18 to $70.  The NAS study 
estimates and confidential manufacturer data are within the same ranges, thus NHTSA 
believes that the NAS estimates are still accurate.  Thus, NHTSA estimates aggressive 
shift logic could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 2 percent at an 
incremental cost of $38, which is approximately the average of the midpoint of the NAS 
cost range and the manufacturer cost range. 
 
  
V-20  
Early Torque Converter Lockup 
 
A torque converter is a fluid coupling located between the engine and transmission in 
vehicles with automatic transmissions and continuously-variable transmissions (CVTs).  
This fluid coupling allows for slip so the engine can run while the vehicle is idling in 
gear, provides for smoothness of the powertrain, and also provides for torque 
multiplication during acceleration.  During light acceleration and cruising, this slip causes 
increased fuel consumption, so modern automatic transmissions utilize a clutch in the 
torque converter to lock it and prevent this slippage.  Fuel consumption can be further 
reduced by locking up the torque converter early, and/or by using partial-lockup 
strategies to reduce slippage.   
 
Some torque converters will require upgraded clutch materials to withstand additional 
loading and the slipping conditions during partial lock-up. As with aggressive shift logic, 
confirmation of acceptable driveability, performance, durability and NVH characteristics 
is required to successfully implement this technology. 
 
The 2002 NAS study did not include any estimates for this technology. The NESCCAF 
study projected that early torque converter lockup could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 0.5 percent at an incremental cost of $0 to $10; while the EEA report 
projected that low-friction lubricants could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 0.5 
percent at an incremental cost of $5.  NHTSA estimates the cost of this technology (i.e., 
the calibration effort) at $30 based in part on NESCCAF and the CBI submissions which 
provided costs with a midpoint of $30.  We have used a higher value here than 
NESCCAF and EEA because we have tried to account for the engineering effort in 
addition to the hardware which we believe NESCCAF and EEA did not do and which 
were captured in the manufacturers’ higher costs. 
 
NHTSA estimates that early torque converter lockup could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by approximately 0.5 percent at an incremental cost of approximately $30. 
 
Automated Shift Manual Transmissions 
 
An automated manual transmission (AMT) is mechanically similar to a conventional 
transmission, but shifting and launch functions are controlled by the vehicle.  There are 
two basic types of AMTs, single-clutch and dual-clutch.  A single-clutch AMT is 
essentially a manual transmission with automated clutch and shifting.  Because there are 
some shift quality issues with single-clutch designs, dual-clutch AMTs are more 
common.  A dual-clutch AMT uses separate clutches for the even-numbered gears and 
odd-numbered gears.  In this way, the next expected gear is pre-selected, which allows 
for faster and smoother shifting. 
 
Overall, AMTs likely offer the greatest potential for fuel consumption reduction among 
the various transmission options presented in this report because they offer the inherently 
lower losses of a manual transmission with the efficiency and shift quality advantages of 
computer control. AMTs offer the lower losses of a manual transmission with the 
  
V-21  
efficiency advantages of computer control.  The lower losses stem from the elimination 
of the conventional lock-up torque converter and a greatly reduced need for high pressure 
hydraulic circuits to hold clutches to maintain gear ratios (in automatic transmissions) or 
hold pulleys in position to maintain gear ratio (in continuously variable transmissions, 
discussed below).  However, the lack of a torque converter will affect how the vehicle 
launches from rest, so an AMT will most likely be paired with an engine that offers 
enough torque in the low-RPM range to allow for adequate launch performance. 
 
An AMT is mechanically similar to a conventional manual transmission, but shifting and 
launch functions are controlled by the vehicle rather than the driver. A switch from a 
conventional automatic transmission with torque converter to an AMT incurs some costs 
but also allows for some cost savings. Savings can be realized through elimination of the 
torque converter which is a very costly part of a traditional automatic transmission, and 
through reduced need for high pressure hydraulic circuits to hold clutches (to maintain 
gear ratios in automatic transmissions) or hold pulleys (to maintain gear ratios in 
Continuously Variable Transmissions). Cost increases would be incurred in the form of 
calibration efforts since transmission calibrations would have to be redone, and the 
addition of a clutch assembly for launce and gear changes. 
 
The NESCCAF study projected that AMTs could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 5 to 8 percent at an incremental cost of $0 to $280; while the EEA report projected 
that low-friction lubricants could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 6 to 7 
percent at an incremental cost of $195 to $225. Confidential manufacturer data projected 
that AMTs could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 2 to 5 percent at an 
incremental cost of $70 to $400. 
 
Taking all these estimates into consideration, NHTSA estimates that AMTs could 
incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 4.5 to 7.5 percent at an incremental cost of 
approximately $141. We believe that, overall, the hardware associated with an AMT, 
whether single clutch or dual clutch, is no more costly than that for a traditional 
automatic transmission given the savings associated with removal of the torque converter 
and high pressure hydraulic circuits, which is estimated to amount to at least $30. 
Nonetheless, given the need for engineering effort (e.g., calibration and vehicle 
integration work) when transitioning from a traditional automatic to an AMT, we have 
estimated the incremental compliance cost at $141, independent of vehicle class, which is  
the midpoint of the NESCCAF estimates and within the range provided confidential 
manufacturer data.  
 
Continuously Variable Transmission 
 
A Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) is unique in that it does not use gears to 
provide ratios for operation. Unlike manual and automatic transmissions with fixed 
transmission ratios, CVTs provide, within their operating ranges, fully variable 
transmission ratios with an infinite number of gears.  This enables even finer optimization 
of the transmission ratio under different operating conditions and, therefore, some 
  
V-22  
reduction of pumping and engine friction losses.  CVTs use either a belt or chain on a 
system of two pulleys.   
 
The main advantage of a CVT is that the engine can operate at its most efficient point 
more often, since there are no fixed ratios.  Also, CVTs often have a wider range of ratios 
than conventional automatic transmissions.   
 
The most common CVT design uses two V-shaped pulleys connected by a metal belt. 
Each pulley is split in half and a hydraulic actuator moves the pulley halves together or 
apart. This causes the belt to ride on either a larger or smaller diameter section of the 
pulley which changes the effective ratio of the input to the output shafts. 
It is assumed that CVTs will only be used on cars, small SUVs, midsize crossover 
vehicles and minivans because they are currently used mainly in lower-torque 
applications. While a high-torque CVT could be developed for small pickup trucks and 
large pickup trucks and large SUVs, it would likely have to be treated separately in terms 
of effectiveness. We do not see development in the area of high-torque CVTs and 
therefore did not include this type in our analysis. 
 
The 2002 NAS study projected that CVTs could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 4 to 8 percent at an incremental cost of $140 to $350.  The NESCCAF study projected 
that CVTs could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 4 percent at an incremental 
cost of $210 to $245.  Confidential manufacturer data projected that CVTs could 
incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 3 to 9 percent at an incremental cost of $140 to 
$800.  These values are incremental to a 4-speed transmission.   
 
Based on an aggregation of manufacturers’ information, we 
estimate a CVT benefit of about 6% over a 4-speed automatic. This is above the 
NESCCAF value, but in the range of NAS. In reviewing our sources for costs, we have 
determined that the adjusted costs presented in the 2002 NESCCAF study represent the 
best available estimates. Subtracting the estimated fuel consumption reduction and costs 
of replacing a 4-speed automatic transmission with a 5-speed automatic transmission 
results in NHTSA projecting that CVTs could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 
3.5 percent when compared to a conventional 5-speed automatic transmission at an 
incremental cost of $100 to $139. 
 
Manual 6-, 7-, and 8-speed Transmissions  
 
As with automatic transmissions, increasing the number of available ratios in a manual 
transmission can improve fuel economy by allowing the driver to select a ratio that 
optimizes engine operation at a given speed.  Typically, this is achieved through adding 
additional overdrive ratios to reduce engine speed (which saves fuel through reduced 
pumping losses).  Six-speed manual transmissions have already achieved significant 
market penetration, so manufacturers have considerable experience with them and the 
associated costs. For those vehicles with five-speed manual transmissions, an upgrade to 
a six-speed could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 0.5 percent. Based on CBI 
submissions, which provided costs with a midpoint of $107, NHTSA estimates that 6-
  
V-23  
speed manual transmissions could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 0.5 percent 
when compared to 5-speed automatic transmission at an incremental cost of $107. 
 
c. Vehicle technologies 
 
Rolling Resistance Reduction 
 
Tire characteristics (e.g., materials, construction, and tread design) influence durability, 
traction control, vehicle handling, and comfort. They also influence rolling resistance – 
the 30 frictional losses associated mainly with the energy dissipated in the deformation of 
the tires under load – and therefore, CO2 emissions. This technology is applicable to all 
vehicles, except for body-on-frame light trucks and performance vehicles (described in 
the next section). Based on a 2006 NAS/NRC report, a 10% rolling resistance reduction 
would provide an increase in fuel economy of 1 to 2 percent.  The same report estimates a 
$1 per tire cost for low rolling resistance tires. For four tires, our incremental compliance 
cost estimate is $6 per vehicle, independent of vehicle class, although not applicable to 
large trucks. 
 
Low Drag Brakes 
 
Low drag brakes reduce the sliding friction of disc brake pads on rotors when the brakes 
are not engaged because the brake shoes are pulled away from the rotating drum.  While 
most passenger cars have already adopted this technology, there are indications that this 
technology is still available for body-on-frame trucks.  According to confidential 
manufacturer data, low drag brakes could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 
percent at an incremental cost of $85 to $90.  NHTSA has adopted these values for its 
analysis. 
 
Front or Secondary Axle Disconnect for Four-Wheel Drive Systems 
 
To provide shift-on-the-fly capabilities, many part-time four-wheel drive systems use 
some type of axle disconnect:  front axle disconnect in ladder-frame vehicles, and 
secondary (i.e., either front or rear) axle disconnect in unibody vehicles.  Front and 
secondary axle disconnect serve two basic purposes.  Using front axle disconnect as an 
example, in two-wheel drive mode, the technology disengages the front axle from the 
front driveline so the front wheels do not turn the front driveline at road speed, saving 
wear and tear.  Then, when shifting from two- to four-wheel drive “on the fly” (while 
moving), the front axle disconnect couples the front axle to the front differential side gear 
only when the transfer case's synchronizing mechanism has spun the front driveshaft up 
to the same speed as the rear driveshaft.   
 
Four-wheel drive systems that have axle disconnect typically do not have either manual- 
or automatic-locking hubs.  To isolate (for example) the front wheels from the rest of the 
front driveline, front axle disconnects use a sliding sleeve to connect or disconnect an 
axle shaft from the front differential side gear. 
 
  
V-24  
This technology has been used by ladder-frame vehicles for some time, but has only 
started to appear on unibody vehicles recently.  The incremental costs and benefits of 
applying front axle disconnect differ, depending on the vehicle’s type of construction.  
According to confidential manufacturer data, front axle disconnects for ladder frame 
vehicles could achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions of 1.5 percent at an 
incremental cost of $114, while secondary axle disconnects for unibody vehicles could 
achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions of 1 percent at an incremental cost of 
$676. NHTSA has adopted these estimates for its analysis. 
 
Aerodynamic Drag Reduction 
 
A vehicle’s size and shape determine the amount of power needed to push the vehicle 
through the air at different speeds. Changes in vehicle shape or frontal area can therefore 
reduce CO2 emissions. Areas for potential aerodynamic drag improvements include 
skirts, air dams, underbody covers, and more aerodynamic side view mirrors. NHTSA 
and EPA estimate a fleet average of 20% total aerodynamic drag reduction is attainable 
for passenger cars, whereas a fleet average of 10% reduction is more realistic for trucks 
(with a caveat for “high-performance” vehicles, described below). These drag reductions 
equate to increases in fuel economy of 2% and 3% for trucks and cars, respectively. 
These numbers are in agreement with the technical literature and supported by 
confidential manufacturer information. The CBI submittals generally showed the RPE 
associated with these changes at less than $100. NHTSA and EPA estimate that the 
incremental compliance cost to range from $0 to $75, independent of vehicle class. 
Aerodynamic drag reduction technologies are readily available today, although the phase-
in time required to distribute over a manufacturer’s fleet is relatively long (6 years or so). 
 
Weight Reduction 
 
The term weight reduction encompasses a variety of techniques with a variety of costs 
and lead times.  These include lighter-weight materials, higher strength materials, 
component redesign, and size matching of components.  Lighter-weight materials involve 
using lower density materials in vehicle components, such as replacing steel parts with 
aluminum or plastic.  The use of higher strength materials involves the substitution of one 
material for another that possesses higher strength and less weight.  An example would 
be using high strength alloy steel versus cold rolled steel.  Component redesign is an on-
going process to reduce costs and/or weight of components, while improving 
performance and reliability.  An example would be a subsystem replacing multiple 
components and mounting hardware. 
 
The cost of reducing weight is difficult to determine and is dependent upon the methods 
used.  For example, a change in design that reduces weight on a new model may or may 
not save money.  On the other hand, material substitution can result in an increase in 
price per application of the technology if more expensive materials are used.   
 
For purposes of this proposed rule, NHTSA has considered only vehicles weighing 
greater than 5,000 pounds for weight reduction through materials substitution.   Provided 
  
V-25  
that those vehicles remain above 5,000 lbs weight, vehicles may realize up to roughly 2 
percent incremental fuel consumption through materials substitution (corresponding to a 
3 percent reduction in vehicle weight) at incremental costs of $0.75 to $1.25 per pound 
reduced. 
 
d.   Accessory technologies 
 
Electric Power Steering  
 
Electric power steering (EPS) is advantageous over hydraulic steering in that it only 
draws power when the wheels are being turned, which is only a small percentage of a 
vehicle’s operating time.  EPS may be implemented on many vehicles with a standard 
12V system; however, for heavier vehicles, a 42V system may be required, which adds 
cost and complexity.   
 
The NAS study projected that a 12V EPS system could incrementally reduce fuel 
consumption by 1.5 to 2.5 percent at an incremental cost of $105 to $150.  The 
NESCCAF study projected that a 12V EPS could incrementally reduce fuel consumption 
by 1 percent at an incremental cost of $28 to $56; while the EEA report projected that a 
12V EPS could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1.5 to 1.9 percent at an 
incremental cost of $70 to $90. According to confidential manufacturer data, electric 
power steering could achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions of 1.5 to 2.0 
percent at an incremental cost of $118 to $197. 
 
NHTSA believes that these manufacturer estimates are more accurate and thus estimates 
that a 12V EPS system could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1.5 to 2 percent 
at an incremental cost of $118 to $197, independent of vehicle class. 
 
Engine Accessory Improvement 
 
The accessories on an engine, like the alternator, coolant, and oil pumps, are traditionally 
driven by the accessory belt.  Improving the efficiency or outright electrification (12V) of 
these accessories (in the case of the mechanically driven pumps) would provide an 
opportunity to reduce the accessory loads on the engine.  However, the potential for such 
replacement will be greater for vehicles with 42V electrical systems. Some large trucks 
also employ mechanical fans, some of which could also be improved or electrified.  
Additionally, there are now higher efficiency alternators which require less of an 
accessory load to achieve the same power flow to the battery.  
 
According to the NAS Report engine accessory improvement could achieve incremental 
fuel consumption reductions of 1 to 2 percent at an incremental cost of $124 to $166.  
Confidential manufacturer information is also within these ranges. The NESCCAF study 
estimated a cost of $56, but that estimate included only a high efficiency generator and 
did not include electrification of other accessories. In reviewing our sources for costs, we 
have determined that the adjusted costs presented in the 2002 NAS study, which ranged 
from $124 to $166 - depending on vehicle class – represent the best available estimates.  
  
V-26  
Based on the NAS study and confidential manufacturer information, NHTSA estimates 
that accessory improvement could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 1 to 2 
percent at an incremental cost of $124 to $166. 
 
Forty-Two Volt (42V) Electrical System  
 
Most vehicles today (aside from hybrids) operate on 12V electrical systems.  At higher 
voltages, which appear to be under consideration to meet expected increases in on-board 
electrical demands, the power density of motors, solenoids, and other electrical 
components may increase to the point that new and more efficient systems, such as 
electric power steering, may be feasible.  A 42V system can also accommodate an 
integrated starter generator.  According to the NAS Report, 42V engine accessory 
improvement could achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions of 1 to 2 percent at 
an incremental cost of $194 to $259.  According to confidential manufacturer data, a 42V 
system could achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions of 0 to 4 percent at an 
incremental cost of $62 to $280.   
 
We believe that the state of 42V technology has evolved to where it is on par with the 
incremental costs and benefits of 12V engine accessory improvement.   In reviewing our 
sources, we have determined that the numbers provided in the 2002 NAS study, which 
estimated that engine accessory improvement could achieve incremental fuel 
consumption reductions of 1 to 2 percent at an incremental cost of $124 to $166 - 
depending on vehicle class – represent the best available estimates for both 12V and 42V 
systems.  Thus, we are estimating that a 42V electrical system could achieve incremental 
fuel consumption reductions of 1 to 2 percent at an incremental cost of $124 to $166.  
These estimates are independent of vehicle class and exclusive of improvements to the 
efficiencies or electrification of 12V accessories.  These estimates are incremental to a 
12V system, regardless of whether the 12V system has improved efficiency or not.   
 
e.   Hybrid technologies 
 
A hybrid describes a vehicle that combines two or more sources of propulsion energy, 
where one uses a consumable fuel (like gasoline) and one is rechargeable (during 
operation, or by another energy source).  Hybrids reduce fuel consumption through three 
major mechanisms: by optimizing the operation of the internal combustion engine 
(through downsizing, or other control techniques) to operate at or near its most efficient 
point more of the time; by recapturing lost braking energy and storing it for later use; and 
by turning off the engine when it is not needed, such as when the vehicle is coasting or 
when stopped. 
 
Hybrid vehicles utilize some combination of the above three mechanisms to reduce fuel 
consumption.  The effectiveness of a hybrid depends on the utilization of the above 
mechanisms and how aggressively they are pursued.  Different hybrid concepts utilize 
these mechanisms differently, so they are treated separately in this analysis.  Below is a 
discussion of the major hybrid concepts judged to be available for use within the 
timeframe of this rulemaking. 
  
V-27  
 
Integrated Starter-Generator with Idle-Off 
 
Integrated Starter-Generator (ISG) systems are the most basic of hybrid systems and offer 
mainly idle-stop capability.  They offer the least power assist and regeneration capability 
of the hybrid approaches, but their low cost and easy adaptability to existing powertrains 
and platforms can make them attractive for some applications.  ISG systems operate at 
around 42V and so have smaller electric motors and less battery capacity than other HEV 
designs because of their lower power demand. 
 
ISG systems replace the conventional belt-driven alternator with a belt-driven, higher 
power starter-alternator.  The starter-alternator starts the engine during idle-stop 
operation, but often a conventional 12V gear-reduction starter is retained to ensure cold-
weather startability.  Also, during idle-stop, some functions such as power steering and 
automatic transmission hydraulic pressure are lost with conventional arrangements, so 
electric power steering and an auxiliary transmission pump are added.  These components 
are similar to those that would be used in other hybrid designs.  An ISG system could be 
capable of providing some launch assist, but it would be limited in comparison to other 
hybrid concepts. According to the NAS Report, an EEA report and confidential 
manufacturer data, ISG systems could achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions 
that range from 5 to 10 percent. 
 
In addition, when idle-off is used (i.e., the petroleum fuelled engine is shut off during idle 
operation), an electric power steering and auxiliary transmission pump are added to 
provide for functioning of these systems which, in a traditional vehicle, were powered by 
the petroleum engine. The 2002 NAS study estimated the cost of these systems at $210 to 
$350 with a 12 volt electrical system and independent of vehicle class, while the 
NESCCAF study estimated the cost for these systems at $280 with a 12 volt electrical 
system for a small car. The 2002 NAS study estimated the cost of these systems to be 
$210 to $350 with a 12 volt electrical system and independent of vehicle class, while the 
NESCCAF study estimated the cost for these systems of $280 with a 12 volt electrical 
system for a small car. Confidential manufacturer information provides cost estimates for 
ISGs that range from $418 to $800.  We believe that the NAS and the NESCCAF 
estimates are still accurate for ISGs with a 12V system. Thus, if you add these cost 
estimates to those we estimated for 42V systems plus associated equipment, which results 
an estimated incremental compliance cost of these systems, including the costs associated 
with upgrading to a 42 volt electrical system of $563 to $600, depending on vehicle class. 
 
Therefore, NHTSA estimates that ISG systems could achieve incremental fuel 
consumption reductions of 5 to 10 percent at incremental costs of $563 to $600, 
depending on vehicle class (this includes the costs associated with upgrading to a 42 volt 
electrical system).  If a 42V system was already applied to a vehicle, the fuel 
consumption reductions and incremental cost for that technology would be subtracted in 
our analysis. 
 
Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)/Integrated Starter-Alternator-Dampener (ISAD) Hybrid 
  
V-28  
 
Honda is the only manufacturer that uses Integrated Motor Assist (IMA), which utilizes a 
thin axial electric motor bolted to the engine’s crankshaft and connected to the 
transmission through a torque converter or clutch.  This electric motor acts as both a 
motor for helping to launch the vehicle and a generator for recovering energy while 
slowing down.  It also acts as the starter for the engine and the electrical system’s main 
generator.  Since it is rigidly fixed to the engine, if the motor turns, the engine must turn 
also, but combustion does not necessarily need to occur.  The Civic Hybrid uses cylinder 
deactivation on all four cylinders for decelerations and some cruise conditions. 
The main advantage of the IMA system is it’s relatively low cost and ease of 
adaptability to conventional vehicles and powertrains while providing excellent 
efficiency gains.   Packaging space is a concern for the physically longer engine-motor-
transmission assembly as well as the necessary battery pack, cabling and power 
electronics.  According to EPA test data and confidential manufacturer product 
information, the IMA system could achieve incremental fuel consumption reductions of 
3.5 to 8.5 percent.44 NHTSA has adopted these estimates for its analysis. 
 
The 2002 NAS study did not consider this technology while the NESCCAF study 
estimated the cost for these systems at $2310 to $2940 for a small car and large car, 
respectively. We have used these estimates combined with confidential manufacturer data 
as the basis for our incremental compliance costs of $1636 for the small car and $2274 
for the large car, expressed in 2006 dollars. We have not estimated incremental 
compliance costs for the other vehicle classes because we do not believe those classes 
would use this technology and would, instead, use the hybrid technologies discussed 
below. 
 
 
2-Mode Hybrids 
 
GM, DaimlerChrysler, and BMW have formed a joint venture to develop a new HEV 
system based on HEV transmission technology originally developed by GM’s Allison 
Transmission Division for heavy-duty vehicles like city buses.  This technology uses an 
adaptation of a conventional stepped-ratio automatic transmission by replacing some of 
the transmission clutches with two electric motors, which makes the transmission act like 
a CVT.  Like Toyota’s Power Split design, these motors control the ratio of engine speed 
to vehicle speed.  But unlike the Power Split system, clutches allow the motors to be 
bypassed, which improves both the transmission’s torque capacity for heavy-duty 
applications and fuel economy at highway speeds.  According to confidential 
manufacturer data, 2-mode hybrids could achieve incremental fuel consumption 
reductions of 25 to 40 percent.  NHTSA estimates that 2-mode hybrids could achieve fuel 
reductions of 3.5 percent to 7 percent incremental to an Integrated Motor Assist 
(IMA)/Integrated Starter-Alternator-Dampener (ISAD) Hybrid. 
 
The 2002 NAS study did not consider this technology, while the NESCCAF study 
estimated the costs to range from $4340 to $5600, depending on vehicle class. These 
                                                 
44 Honda’s cost estimates are protected per Honda’s confidentiality agreement with NHTSA. 
  
V-29  
estimates are not incremental to an Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)/Integrated Starter-
Alternator-Dampener (ISAD) Hybrid.  To accurately project the cost of 2-mode hybrids 
when they were applied to midsize and large cars we subtracted the estimated costs of an 
Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)/Integrated Starter-Alternator-Dampener (ISAD) Hybrid  
We have used the NESCCAF estimates as the basis for our incremental compliance costs 
of $1,501 to $5,127 in 2006 dollars, incremental to an Integrated Motor Assist 
(IMA)/Integrated Starter-Alternator-Dampener (ISAD) Hybrid or an ISG system 
depending on vehicle class.45 We have not estimated incremental compliance costs for 
small cars because we believe that this ISG or IMA/ISAD technology is a better fit for 
small cars. 
 
 
Power Split Hybrid 
 
Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive system as used in the Prius is a completely different 
approach than Honda’s IMA system and uses a “Power Split” device in place of a 
conventional transmission.  The Power Split system replaces the vehicle’s transmission 
with a single planetary gear and a motor/generator.  A second, more powerful 
motor/generator is permanently connected to the vehicle’s final drive and always turns 
with the wheels.  The planetary gear splits the engine’s torque between the first 
motor/generator and the drive motor.  The first motor/generator uses its engine torque to 
either charge the battery or supply additional power to the drive motor.  The speed of the 
first motor/generator determines the relative speed of the engine to the wheels.  In this 
way, the planetary gear allows the engine to operate completely independently of vehicle 
speed, much like a CVT. 
 
The Power Split system allows for outstanding fuel economy in city driving.  The vehicle 
also avoids the cost of a conventional transmission, replacing it with a much simpler 
single planetary and motor/generator.  However, it is less efficient at highway speeds due 
to the requirement that the first motor/generator must be constantly spinning at a 
relatively high speed to maintain the correct ratio.  Also, load capacity is limited to the 
first motor/generator’s capacity to resist the reaction torque of the drive train. 
 
A version of Toyota’s Power Split system is also used in the Lexus RX400h and Toyota 
Highlander sport utility vehicles.  This version has more powerful motor/generators to 
handle higher loads and also adds a third motor/generator on the rear axle of four-wheel-
drive models.  This provides the vehicle with four wheel drive capability and four wheel 
regenerative braking capability.  Ford’s CVT system used in the hybrid Escape is another 
version of the Power Split system, but four-wheel-drive models use a conventional 
transfer case and drive shaft to power the rear wheels. 
 
Other versions of this system are used in the Lexus GS450h and Lexus LS600h luxury 
sedans.  These systems have modifications and additional hardware for sustained high-
speed operation and/or all-wheel-drive capability.  However, the Power Split system isn’t 
planned for usage on full-size trucks and SUVs due to its limited ability to provide the 
                                                 
45 GM’s cost estimates are protected per GM’s confidentiality agreement with NHTSA. 
  
V-30  
torque needed by these vehicles. It’s anticipated that full-size trucks and SUVs would use 
the 2-mode hybrid system. The 2002 NAS study didn’t consider this technology, while 
the NESCCAF study estimated the incremental costs at to be $3500 prior to any cost 
adjustment. Based on the NESCCAF study and fuel economy test data from EPA’s 
certification database which shows these systems being capable of reducing fuel 
consumption by 25 to 35 percent, NHTSA estimates that Power Split hybrids can achieve 
incremental fuel consumption reductions of 25 to 35 percent over conventionally 
powered vehicles at an incremental cost of $3,700 to $3,850.  Because NHTSA applies 
technologies incrementally to the technologies preceding them on our decision trees, the 
incremental fuel consumption reductions for Power Split hybrids are estimated to be 5 to 
6.5 percent incremental to 2-Mode Hybrids (the technology that precedes Power Split 
hybrids on the decision tree), because the technologies applied prior to and including 2-
Mode hybrids are estimated to have incremental fuel consumption reductions of 20 to 
28.5 percent over conventionally powered vehicles. The technologies discussed below 
were not projected for use during the MY 2011 to 2015 timeframes because NHTSA isn’t 
aware that any manufacturer is including these technologies in any vehicle for which we 
have production plans for nor has any manufacturer publicly stated that any of these 
technologies will definitively be included on future products.  If NHTSA receives such 
information regarding any technology(ies), it will revisit this decision for the final rule.  
NHTSA is including its discussion of these technologies and their estimated costs and 
fuel consumption reductions as a reference for commenters and in anticipation of their 
possible inclusion in the final rule.  
 
Variable Compression Ratio 
 
A spark-ignited engine’s specific power is limited by the engine’s compression ratio, 
which is, in turn, currently limited by the engine’s susceptibility to knock, particularly 
under high load conditions.  Engines with variable compression ratio (VCR) improve fuel 
economy by the use of higher compression ratios at lower loads and lower compression 
ratios under higher loads.  The NAS Report projected that VCR could incrementally 
reduce fuel consumption by 2 to 6 percent over 4-valve VVT at an incremental cost of 
$218 to $510.    NHTSA has no information which suggests that VCR will be included on 
any vehicles during the MY 2011-2015 timeframe, thus NHTSA does not use this 
technology in its analysis.  Additionally, no updates to these estimates were sought. 
 
Lean-Burn Gasoline Direct Injection Technology 
 
One way to improve dramatically an engine’s thermodynamic efficiency is by operating 
at a lean air-fuel mixture (excess air).  Fuel system improvements, changes in combustion 
chamber design and repositioning of the injectors have allowed for better air/fuel mixing 
and combustion efficiency.  There is currently a shift from wall-guided injection to spray 
guided injection, which improves injection precision and targeting towards the spark 
plug, increasing lean combustion stability.   Combined with advances in NOx after-
treatment, lean-burn GDI engines may be a possibility in North America.   
  
V-31  
However, a key technical requirement for lean-burn GDI engines to meet EPA’s Tier 2 
NOx emissions levels is the availability of low-sulfur gasoline, which is projected to be 
unavailable during MY 2011 – 2015. 
 
According to the NESCCAF report and confidential manufacturer data NHTSA estimates 
that lean-burn GDI engines could incrementally reduce fuel consumption from 9 to 16 
percent at an incremental cost of $500 to $750 compared to a port-fueled (stoichiometric) 
engine.  NHTSA did not project the use of this technology during the time frame covered 
by this proposal, due to large uncertainties surrounding the availability of low-sulfur 
gasoline.   Nonetheless, we have estimated the incremental compliance cost for these 
systems at $750, independent of vehicle class, and incremental to a stoichiometric GDI 
engine. 
 
Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition 
 
Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), also referred to as controlled auto 
ignition (CAI), is an alternate engine operating mode that does not rely on a spark event 
to initiate combustion.  The principles are more closely aligned with a diesel combustion 
cycle, in which the compressed charge exceeds a temperature and pressure necessary for 
spontaneous ignition.  The resulting burn is much shorter in duration with higher thermal 
efficiency. 
 
An HCCI engine has inherent advantages in its overall efficiency for several reasons.  An 
extremely lean fuel/air charge increases thermodynamic efficiency.  Shorter combustion 
times and higher EGR tolerance permit very high compression ratios (which also increase 
thermodynamic efficiency).  Additionally, pumping losses are reduced because the 
engine can run unthrottled. 
 
However, due to the nature of its combustion process, HCCI is difficult to control, 
requiring in-cylinder pressure sensors and very fast engine control logic to optimize 
combustion timing, especially considering the variable nature of operating conditions 
seen in a vehicle.  To be used in a commercially acceptable vehicle application, an HCCI-
equipped engine would most likely be “dual-mode,” in which HCCI operation is 
complemented with a traditional SI combustion process at idle and at higher loads and 
speeds. 
 
Until recently, HCCI technology was considered to still be in the research phase.  
However, several manufacturers have made public statements about the viability of 
incorporating HCCI into production vehicles over the next 10 years.  The NESCCAF 
study estimated the cost to range from $560 to $840, depending on vehicle class, 
including the costs for a stoichiometric GDI system with DVVL. We have based our 
estimated incremental compliance cost on the NESCCAF estimates and, after subtracting 
out the estimated incremental cost for a stoichiometric GDI system with DVVL, we 
estimate the incremental cost for HCCI to be from $263 to $685, depending on vehicle 
class.  This estimated incremental compliance cost is incremental to a stoichiometric GDI 
engine.

Advanced CVT 
 
Advanced CVTs have the ability to deliver higher torques than existing CVTs and have 
the potential for broader market penetration.   These new designs incorporate toroidal 
friction elements or cone-and-ring assemblies with varying diameters.  According to the 
NAS Report, advanced CVT could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by up to 2 
percent at an incremental cost of $364 to $874.   NHTSA has no information which 
suggests that VCR will be included on any vehicles during the MY 2011-2015 timeframe, 
thus NHTSA does not use this technology in its analysis.  Additionally, no updates to 
these estimates were sought. 
 
Plug-in Hybrids 
 
Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are very similar to hybrid electric vehicles, 
but with three significant functional differences.  The first is the addition of a means to 
charge the battery pack from an outside source of electricity (usually the electric grid).  
Second, a PHEV would have a larger battery pack with more energy storage, and a 
greater capability to be discharged.  Finally, a PHEV would have a control system that 
allows the battery pack to be significantly depleted during normal operation.   
 
Deriving some of their propulsion energy from the electric grid provides several 
advantages for PHEVs.  PHEVs offer a significant opportunity to replace petroleum used 
for transportation energy with domestically-produced electricity.  The reduction in 
petroleum usage does, of course, depend on the amount of electric drive the vehicle is 
capable of under its duty cycle. 
 
The fuel consumption reduction potential of PHEVs depends on many factors, the most 
important being the electrical capacity designed into the battery pack. To estimate the 
fuel consumption reduction potential of PHEVs, EPA has developed an in-house vehicle 
energy model (PEREGRIN) which is based on the PERE (Physical Emission Rate 
Estimator) physics-based model used as a fuel consumption input for EPA’s 
MOVES mobile source emissions modelB. 
 
EPA modeled the PHEV small car, large car, minivan and small trucks using parameters 
from a midsize car similar to today’s hybrids and scaled to each vehicle’s weight. The 
large truck PHEV was modeled separately assuming very little engine downsizing. Each 
PHEV was assumed to have enough battery capacity for a 20-mile-equivalent all-electric 
range and a power requirement to provide similar performance to a hybrid vehicle. A 
twenty mile range was selected because it offers a good compromise for vehicle 
performance, weight, battery packaging and cost.  
To calculate the total energy use of a PHEV, a vehicle can be thought of as 
operating in two distinct modes, electric (EV) mode, and hybrid (HEV) mode. The 
energy consumed during EV operation can be accounted for and calculated in terms of 
gasoline-equivalent MPG by using 10CFR474, Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, 
Development, and Demonstration Program; Petroleum-Equivalent Fuel Economy 
  
V-33  
Calculation. The EV mode fuel economy can then be combined with the HEV mode fuel 
economy using the Utility Factor calculation in SAE J1711 to determine a total MPG 
value for the vehicle. Calculating a total fuel consumption reduction based on model 
outputs, gasoline-equivalent calculations, and the Utility Factor calculations, results in a 
28% fuel consumption reduction for small cars, large cars, minivans, and small trucks 
and a 31% fuel consumption reduction for large trucks. 
 
The fuel consumption reduction potential of PHEVs will vary based on the electrical 
capacity designed into the battery pack.  Assuming a 20-mile “all-electric range” design, 
a PHEV might incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 28 to 31 percent.46  Based on 
discussions with EPA, we have estimated the incremental cost of PHEVs to be from 
$4500 to $10200, depending on vehicle class. 
 
NHTSA is aware that manufacturers have made public statements about their intent to 
produce PHEVs during the MY 2011 – 2015 timeframe.  However, NHTSA has received 
no information from these manufacturers that provides all the specifications and 
production data that is necessary for NHTSA to include these vehicles in this analysis. 
NHTSA hopes to receive complete product plan information from these manufacturers 
concerning any PHEVs that they plan on producing during the MY 2011- 2015 
timeframe. 
 
NHTSA would like to note that if it receives new and/or updated information from 
manufacturers regarding the likelihood of PHEV production during the MY 2011 to 2015 
timeframe, it will make every effort to include PHEVs as a technology in its final rule.  
To enable the possible inclusion of PHEVs as a technology, NHTSA would also have to 
configure the Volpe model to account for the estimated source(s) that would supply the 
electricity for electrical grid charging of the battery.  Work has started on this effort, but 
has not yet been completed.   
 
Additionally, NHTSA is unaware of the existence of any batteries that are deemed 
acceptable for the performance characteristics necessary for a plug-in hybrid.  Therefore, 
although we discuss them here, the model does not currently apply them. 
 
The tables below summarize for each of the 10 classes of vehicles the cost and 
effectiveness assumptions used in this rulemaking as well as the year of availability of 
each technology.  The agency seeks comments on our assumptions and the cost and 
effectiveness estimates provided. 
 
 
                                                 
46 This estimate is based on the EPA test cycle.  We are unable to provide cost estimates for PHEV 
technology due to the great amount of uncertainty surrounding the chemistry, safety and performance 
requirements of the appropriate battery technology that would be used.

C.   Technology synergies 
 
When two or more technologies are added to a particular vehicle model to improve its fuel 
efficiency, the resultant fuel consumption reduction may sometimes be higher or lower than the 
product of the individual effectiveness values for those items.  This may occur because one or 
more technologies applied to the same vehicle partially address the same source or sources of 
engine or vehicle losses.  Alternately, this effect may be seen when one technology shifts the 
engine operating points, and therefore increases or reduces the fuel consumption reduction 
achieved by another technology or set of technologies.  The difference between the observed fuel 
consumption reduction associated with a set of technologies and the product of the individual 
effectiveness values in that set is sometimes referred to as a “synergy.”  Synergies may be 
positive (increased fuel consumption reduction compared to the product of the individual effects) 
or negative (decreased fuel consumption reduction). 
 
The NAS committee which authored the 2002 Report was aware of technology synergies and 
considered criticisms as part of the peer-review process that its analysis was “judgment-
simplified,” but concluded overall that its approach was “sufficiently rigorous” for purposes of 
the report.47  After examining its analysis again, the committee stated that “…the path 1 and path 
2 estimate average fuel consumption improvements … appear quite reasonable, although the 
uncertainty in the analysis grows as more technology features are considered.”48  In essence, as 
more technology features are considered, the features are more likely to overlap and result in 
synergies.  Because NAS did not expect vehicle manufacturers to reach “path 3” in the 
timeframe considered, it did not concern itself deeply with the effect of technology synergies in 
its analysis. 
 
NHTSA’s rulemaking regarding CAFE standards for MY 2008-MY 2011 light trucks made 
significant use of NAS’ “path 2” estimates of the effectiveness and cost of available 
technologies.  In part because its analysis did not extend to the more aggressive “path 3,” the 
agency concluded that the NAS-based multiplicative approach it followed when aggregating 
these technologies was reasonable.  In contrast, the agency’s current proposal is based on an 
analysis that includes a broader range of technologies than was considered by NAS in 2001 and 
2002.  Also, the extent to which technologies are included in the current analysis is more 
consistent with NAS’ prior “path 3” approach.  Therefore, the agency’s current analysis uses 
estimated “synergies” to address the uncertainties mentioned in the 2002 NAS report. 
 
The Volpe model has been modified to estimate the interactions of technologies using estimates 
of incremental synergies associated with a number of technology pairs identified by NHTSA, 
Volpe Center, and EPA staff.  The use of discrete technology pair incremental synergies is 
similar to that in DOE’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS).49  Inputs to the Volpe 
model incorporate NEMS-identified pairs, as well as additional pairs from the set of technologies 
considered in the Volpe model.  However, to maintain an approach that was consistent with the

V-41  
technology sequencing developed by NHTSA, Volpe Center, and EPA staff, new incremental 
synergy estimates for all pairs were obtained from a first-order “lumped parameter” analysis tool 
created by EPA.50  Results of this analysis were generally consistent with those of full-scale 
vehicle simulation modeling performed by Ricardo, Inc.51  NHTSA’s analysis applies these 
incremental synergy values, obtained from the tool using baseline passenger car engine and 
vehicle inputs, to all vehicle classes. 
 
Incremental synergy values are specified in Volpe model input files in two ways: as part of the 
incremental effectiveness values table (same path technologies) and in a separate incremental 
synergies table (separate path technologies).  In the case of same path technologies, each 
technology's incremental effectiveness value was obtained from the technical literature and 
manufacturers’ submitted information, and then the sum of all incremental synergies associated 
with that technology and each technology located higher on the same path was subtracted to 
determine the incremental effectiveness.  For example, all engine technologies take into account 
incremental synergy factors of preceding engine technologies; all transmission technologies take 
into account incremental synergy factors of preceding transmission technologies.  These factors 
are expressed in the fuel consumption improvement factors in the input files used by the Volpe 
model. 
 
For applying incremental synergy factors in separate path technologies, the Volpe model uses an 
input table which lists technology pairings and incremental synergy factors associated with those 
pairings, most of which are between engine technologies and transmission technologies. When a 
technology is applied to a vehicle by the Volpe model, all instances of that technology in the 
incremental synergy table which match technologies already applied to the vehicle (either pre-
existing or previously applied by the Volpe model) are summed and applied to the fuel 
consumption improvement factor of the technology being applied.  When the Volpe model 
applies incremental synergies, the fuel consumption improvement factors cannot be reduced 
below zero. 
 
Incremental synergy values were calculated assuming the prior application (implying succession 
in some cases) of all technologies located higher along both paths than the pair considered.  This 
is usually a true reflection of a given vehicle's equipment at any point in the model run and thus 
the method is expected to produce reasonable results in most cases. 
 
NHTSA considered other methods for estimating interactions between technologies.  For 
example, the agency has considered integrating detailed simulation of individual vehicles’ 
performance into the Volpe model.52  However, while application of such simulation techniques 
could provide a useful source of information when developing inputs to the Volpe model, the 
                                                 
50 This tool is a simple spreadsheet model that represents energy consumption in terns of average performance over 
the fuel economy test procedure, rather than explicitly analyzing specific drive cycles.  The tool begins with an 
apportionment of fuel consumption across several loss mechanisms, and accounts for the average extent to which 
different technologies affect these loss mechanisms 
51 EPA contracted with Ricardo, Inc. (an independent consulting firm) to study the potential effectiveness of carbon 
dioxide-reducing (and thus, fuel economy-improving) vehicle technologies.  The Ricardo study is available in the 
docket for this NPRM.  
52 In other words, having the Volpe model run a full vehicle simulation every time the Volpe model is evaluating the 
potential effect of applying a specific technology to a specific vehicle model. 
  
V-42  
agency believes that applying detailed simulation when analyzing the entire fleet of future 
vehicles is neither necessary nor feasible.  NHTSA is charged with setting standards at the 
maximum feasible level.  To understand the potential impacts of its standards, the agency 
analyzes entire fleets of vehicles expected to be produced in the future.  Although some expected 
engineering characteristics of these vehicles are available, the level of detail needed for full 
vehicle simulation—a level of detail that would be important if NHTSA were actually designing 
vehicles—is not available. 
 
As another possible alternative to using “synergy” factors, NHTSA has also considered 
modifying the Volpe model to accept as inputs different measures of efficiency for each engine, 
transmission, and vehicle model in the product plans.   For instance, manufacturers could provide 
estimates of mechanical and drivetrain efficiencies.  Mechanical efficiency (usually between 70 
and 90 percent) gives an estimate of the amount of fuel consumed by engine friction and 
pumping losses. Drivetrain efficiency (usually between 80 and 90 percent) gives an estimate of 
the amount of fuel consumed by parasitic loads and gearbox friction.  From these efficiencies 
along with other inputs such as compression ratio, aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, and 
vehicle mass, the model could estimate the fuel consumption associated with each loss 
mechanism and enforce a maximum fuel consumption reduction for each vehicle model based on 
those estimates and the technologies applied.  Like the use of incremental synergies, this method 
could help the model avoid double counting fuel consumption benefits when applying multiple 
technologies to the same vehicle model.53  The agency believes that this approach, like the use of 
“synergy” factors currently used by the Volpe model, could conceivably provide a means of 
addressing uncertainty in fuel consumption estimation within the context of CAFE analysis.  
However, the agency is not confident that model-by-model estimates of baseline fuel 
consumption partitioning would be available.  Also, partitioned estimates of the effects of all the 
technologies considered in the analysis of this proposal were not available.  If both of these 
concerns could be addressed, NHTSA believes it would be possible to implement partitioned 
accounting of fuel consumption.  However, the agency is unsure whether and, if so, to what 
extent doing so would represent an improvement over our current approach of using incremental 
synergy factors. 
 
The agency solicits comments on its use of incremental synergy factors to address uncertainty in 
the estimation of the extent to which fuel consumption is reduced by applying technologies.  In 
particular, the agency solicits comment on (a) the values of the factors the agency has applied, 
(b) possible variations across the ten categories of vehicles the agency has considered, and (c) 
additional technology pairs that may involve such interactions.  The proposal of any additional 
methodologies, such as prototyping and testing, full vehicle simulation, or partitioned 
accounting, should address information and resource requirements, particularly as related to the 
analysis of entire fleets of future vehicles expected to be produced through MY 2015. 
 
4. Technology cost learning curve 
 
 
                                                 
53 This approach was proposed in a paper criticizing NAS’ approach to synergies in the 2001-02 peer-review process 
for the NAS Report.  See Patton, et al., “Aggregating Technologies for Reduced Fuel Consumption:  A Review of 
the Technical Content in the 2002 National Research Council Report on CAFE”, SAE 2002-01-0628, March 2002. 
  
V-43  
In past rulemaking analyses, NHTSA did not explicitly account for the cost reductions a 
manufacturer may realize through learning achieved from experience in actually applying a 
given technology.  NHTSA understood technology cost-estimates to reflect already the full 
learning costs of technology.  EPA felt that for some of the newer, emerging technologies, cost 
estimates did not reflect the full impact of learning. NHTSA tentatively agreed, but is seeking 
comment on the impact of learning on cost and the production volumes where it occurs. NHTSA 
has modified its previous approach in this rulemaking for that reason. In this rulemaking we have 
included a learning factor for some of the technologies.  The “learning curve” describes the 
reduction in unit incremental production costs as a function of accumulated production volume 
and small redesigns that reduce costs. 
 
NHTSA implemented technology learning curves by using three parameters: (1) the initial 
production volume that must be reached before cost reductions begin to be realized (referred to 
as “threshold volume”); (2) the percent reduction in average unit cost that results from each 
successive doubling of cumulative production volume (usually referred to as the “learning rate”); 
and (3) the initial cost of the technology.  Section V below describing the Volpe model contains 
additional information on learning curve functions. 
 
Figure 2 illustrates a learning curve for a vehicle technology with an initial average unit cost of 
$100 and a learning rate of approximately 20 percent.  In this hypothetical example, the initial 
production volume before cost reductions begin to be realized is set at 12,000 units and the 
production volume at the cost floor is set at roughly 50,000 units with a cost of $64.   
 
Figure 2.  Typical Experience Curve 
 
 
Most studies of the effect of the learning curve on production costs appear to assume that cost 
reductions begin only after some initial volume threshold has been reached, but not all of these 
studies specify what this threshold volume is.  The rate at which costs decline beyond the initial 
threshold is usually expressed as the percent reduction in average unit cost that results from each 
successive doubling of cumulative production volume, sometimes referred to as the learning 
rate.  Many estimates of learning experience curves do not specify a cumulative production 
volume beyond which cost reductions no longer occur, instead depending on the asymptotic 
  
V-44  
behavior of the above expression of (CQ) for learning rates below 100 percent to establish a floor 
on costs.   
 
For this analysis, NHTSA has applied learning curve cost reductions on a manufacturer-specific 
basis, and has assumed that learning-based reductions in technology costs occur at the point that 
a manufacturer applies the given technology to 25,000 cars or trucks, and are repeated a second 
time as it produces another 25,000 cars or trucks for the second learning step (car and truck 
volumes are treated separately for determining these sales volumes).  The volumes chosen 
represent our best estimate for where learning would occur.  As such, we believe that these 
estimates are better suited to this analysis than a more general approach of a single number for 
the learning curve factor, because each manufacturer would be implementing technologies at its 
own pace in this rule, rather than assuming that all manufacturers implement identical 
technology at the same time.  NHTSA is aware that some of the cost estimates that is has relied 
upon were derived from suppliers and has added multipliers so that these costs are reflective of 
what manufacturers would pay for this technology.  NHTSA seeks comments on the estimated 
level of price markups that manufacturers pay for technologies purchased from suppliers and 
whether different learning curves should be applied to those types of technologies. 
 
Ideally, we would know the development production cycle and maturity level for each 
technology so that we could calculate learning curves precisely.  Without that knowledge, we 
have to use engineering judgment.  After having produced 25,000 cars or trucks with a specific 
part or system, we believe that sufficient learning will have taken place such that costs will be 
lower by 20 percent for some technologies and 10 percent for others.  After another 25,000 units, 
its expected that, for some technologies, such as 6-speed AMTs, that another cost reduction will 
have been realized.   
 
For each of the technologies, we have considered whether we could project future cost 
reductions due to manufacturer learning.  In making this determination, we considered whether 
or not the technology was in wide-spread use today or expected to be by the model year 2011-
2012 time frame, in which case no future learning curve would apply because the technology 
would already be in wide-spread production by the automotive industry by that timeframe, e.g., 
on the order of multi-millions of units per year.  (Examples of these include 5-speed automatic 
transmissions and intake-cam phasing variable valve timing.  These technologies have been in 
production for light-duty vehicles for more than 10 years.)  In addition, we carefully considered 
the underlying source data for our cost estimates.  If the source data specifically stated that 
manufacturer cost reduction from future learning would occur, we took that information into 
account in determining whether we would apply manufacturer learning in our cost projections.  
Thus, for many of the technologies, we have not applied any future cost reduction learning curve. 
 
However, there are a number of technologies which are not yet in mass production for which we 
have applied a learning curve.  As indicated in Table 7 below, we have applied the learning 
curve beginning in MY 2011 to one set of technologies, and for a number of additional 
technologies we did not apply manufacturer learning until MY 2014.  The distinction between 
MYs 2011 and 2014 is due to our source data for our cost estimates.  For those technologies 
where we have applied manufacturer learning in MY 2011, the source of our cost estimate did 
  
V-45  
not rely on manufacturer learning to develop the initial cost estimate we have used – therefore 
we apply the manufacturer learning methodology beginning in MY 2011.

The technologies for which we do not begin applying learning until 2014 all have the same 
reference source, the 2004 NESCCAF study, for which the sub-contractor was The Martec 
Group.  In the work done for the 2004 NESCCAF report, Martec relied upon actual price quotes 
from Tier 1 automotive suppliers to develop automotive manufacturer cost estimates. Based on 
information presented by Martec to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee during 
their January 24, 2008, public meeting in Dearborn, Michigan,54 we understand that the Martec 
cost estimates incorporated some element of manufacturer learning.  Martec stated that the Tier 1 
suppliers were specifically requested to provide price quotes which would be valid for three 
years (2009-2011), and that for some components the Tier 1 supplier included cost reductions in 
years two and three which the supplier anticipated could occur, and which they anticipated 
would be necessary in order for their quote to be competitive with other suppliers.  Therefore, for 
this analysis, we did not apply any learning curve to any of the Martec-sourced costs for the first 
three years of this proposal (2011-2013).  However, the theory of manufacturer learning is that it 
is a continuous process, though the rate of improvement decreases as the number of units

produced increases.  While we were not able to gain access to the detailed submissions from Tier 
1 suppliers which Martec relied upon for their estimates, we do believe that additional cost 
reductions will occur in the future for a number of the technologies for which we relied upon the 
Martec cost estimates for the reasons stated above in reference to the general learning curve 
effect.  For those technologies we applied a learning curve beginning in 2014.   Martec has 
recently submitted a study to the NAS Committee comparing the 2004 NESCCAF study with 
new updated cost information.  Given that this study had just been completed, the agency could 
not take it into consideration for the NPRM.  However, the agency will review the new study and 
consider its findings in time for the final rule. 
 
Manufacturers’ actual costs for applying these technologies to specific vehicle models are likely 
to include significant additional outlays for accompanying design or engineering changes to each 
model, development and testing of prototype versions, recalibrating engine operating parameters, 
and integrating the technology with other attributes of the vehicle.  Manufacturers may also incur 
additional corporate overhead, marketing, or distribution and selling expenses as a consequence 
of their efforts to improve the fuel economy of individual vehicle models and their overall 
product lines.  
 
In order to account for these additional costs, NHTSA has applied an indirect cost multiplier of 
1.5 to its estimate of the vehicle manufacturers’ direct costs for producing or acquiring each fuel 
economy-improving technology to arrive at a consumer cost.  This estimate was developed by 
Argonne National Laboratory in a recent review of vehicle manufacturers’ indirect costs.  The 
Argonne study was specifically intended to improve the accuracy of future cost estimates for 
production of vehicles that achieve high fuel economy by employing many of the same advanced 
technologies considered in the agency’s analysis.55  Thus, its recommendation that a multiplier of 
1.5 be applied to direct manufacturing costs to reflect manufacturers’ increased indirect costs for 
deploying advanced fuel economy technologies appears to be appropriate for use in the current 
analysis.  Historically, NHTSA has used almost the exact same multiplier, a multiplier of 1.51, as 
the markup from variable costs or direct manufacturing costs to consumer costs.  This markup 
takes into account fixed costs, burden, manufacturer’s profit, and dealers profit.  Table VII-2 of 
the PRIA shows the estimated incremental consumer costs for each vehicle type.56 
 
E.   Ensuring sufficient lead time  
 
In analyzing potential technological improvements to the product offerings for each 
manufacturer with a substantial share of the market, NHTSA added technologies based on our 
engineering judgment and expertise about possible adjustments to the detailed product plans 
submitted to NHTSA.  Our decision whether and when to add a technology reflected our 
consideration of the practicability of applying a specific technology and the necessity for lead-
time in its application.  NHTSA recognizes that vehicle manufacturers must have sufficient lead 
time to incorporate changes and new features into their vehicles and hence added technologies in 
a cost-minimizing fashion.  That is, we generally added technologies that were most cost-
effective and took into account the year of availability of the technologies.

NHTSA realizes that not all technologies will be available immediately or could be applied 
immediately and that there are different phase-in rates (how rapidly a technology is able to be 
applied across a manufacturer’s fleet of vehicles) applicable to each technology as well as 
windows of opportunities when certain technologies could be applied (i.e., when a product is 
redesigned or refreshed). 
 
1.   Linking to redesign and refresh 
 
In the automobile industry there are two terms that describe when changes to vehicles occur: 
redesign and refresh.  In projecting the technologies that could be applied to specific vehicle 
models, NHTSA tied the application of the majority of the technologies to a vehicle’s 
refresh/redesign cycle.   Vehicle redesign usually encompasses changes to a vehicle’s 
appearance, shape, dimensions, and powertrain and is traditionally associated with the 
introduction of “new” vehicles into the market, and often is characterized as the next generation 
of a vehicle.  In contrast vehicle refresh usually only encompasses changes to a vehicle’s 
appearance, and may include an upgraded powertrain and is traditionally associated with mid-
cycle cosmetic changes to a vehicle within its current generation to make it appear “fresh.”  
Vehicle refresh traditionally occurs no earlier than two years after a vehicle redesign or at least 
two years before a scheduled redesign.  Table 8 below contains a complete list of the 
technologies that were applied and whether NHTSA allowed them to be applied during a 
redesign year, a refresh year or during any model year is shown in the below table.

As can be seen in the above table, most technologies would only be applied by the Volpe model 
when a specific vehicle was due for a redesign or refresh.  However, for a limited set of 
technologies, the model was not restricted to applying them during a refresh/redesign year and 
thus they were made available for application at any time.  These specific technologies are: 
• Low Friction Lubricants 
• Improved Accessories 
• Low Rolling Resistance Tires 
• Low Drag Brakes 
 
All of these technologies are very cost-effective, can apply to multiple vehicle models/platforms 
and can be applied across multiple vehicle models/platforms in one year.  Although they can also 
be applied during a refresh/redesign year, they are not restricted to that timeframe because their 
application is not viewed as necessitating a major engineering redesign and testing/calibration. 
 
There is an additional technology whose application is not tied to refresh/redesign, which is 
Aggressive Shift Logic (ASL).  ASL is accomplished through reprogramming the shift points for 
a transmission to be more like a manual transmission. Upgrading a transmission to utilize ASL 
can happen at refresh/redesign, but because it is not a hardware change, it can also occur at other 
points in a vehicle’s design cycle.  If a model that is scheduled for refresh/redesign has a 
transmission that is being upgraded to ASL, it is possible that all other vehicles that utilize the 
same transmission (which is usually produced at the same manufacturing plant) could be 
  
V-49  
upgraded at the same time to incorporate ASL and that ASL could permeate other vehicle 
models in years other than a refresh/redesign year. 
 
NHTSA based the redesign rates used in the Volpe Model on a combination of the 
manufacturers confidential product plans and on NHTSA’s engineering judgment. In most 
instances, NHTSA has accepted the projected redesign periods from the companies who 
provided them through MY 2013.  If companies did not provide product plan date, NHTSA used 
publicly available data about vehicle redesigns to establish the redesign rates for the vehicles 
produced by these companies.   
 
NHTSA assumes that passenger cars will be redesigned every 5 years, based on the trend over 
the last 10-15 years for passenger cars to be redesigned every 5 years.  These trends are reflected 
in the manufacturer production plans that NHTSA received in response to its request for product 
plan information and was confirmed by many automakers in meetings held with NHTSA to 
discuss various issues with manufacturers.   
 
NHTSA believes that the vehicle design process has progressed and improved rapidly over the 
last decade and these improvements have resulted in the ability of manufacturers to shorten the 
design process and to introduce vehicles more frequently to respond to competitive market 
forces.  Almost all passenger cars will be on a 5-year redesign cycle by the end of the decade, 
with the exception being some high performance vehicles and vehicles’ with specific market 
niches.  
 
Currently, light trucks are redesigned every 5 to 7 years, with some vehicles having longer 
redesign periods (e.g., full-size vans).  In the most competitive SUV and crossover vehicle 
segments, the redesign cycle currently averages slightly above 5 years.  It is expected that the 
light truck redesign schedule will be shortened in the future due to competitive market forces and 
in response to fuel economy and other regulatory requirements.  It is expected that by MY 2014, 
almost all light trucks will be redesigned on a 5-year cycle.  Thus, for almost all vehicles 
scheduled for a redesign in model year 2014 and later, NHTSA estimated that all vehicles would 
be redesigned on a 5-year cycle.  Exceptions were made for high performance vehicles and other 
vehicles that traditionally had longer than average design cycles (e.g., 2-seater sports cars).  For 
those vehicles, NHTSA attempted to preserve the historic redesign cycle rates. 
 
2. Technology phase-in caps  
 
 In analyzing potential technological improvements to the product offerings for each 
manufacturer with a substantial share of the market, NHTSA added technologies based on our 
engineering judgment and expertise about possible adjustments to the detailed product plans 
submitted to NHTSA.  Our decision whether and when to add a technology reflected our 
consideration of the practicability of applying a specific technology and the necessity for lead-
time in its application. 
 
NHTSA recognizes that vehicle manufacturers must have sufficient lead time to incorporate 
changes and new features into their vehicles and that these changes cannot occur all at once, but 
must be phased in over time.  As discussed above, our analysis addresses these realities in part 
  
V-50  
by timing the estimated application of most technologies to coincide with anticipated vehicle 
redesigns and/or freshenings.  We have estimated that future vehicle redesigns can be 
implemented on a 5-year cycle with mid-cycle freshening, except where manufacturers have 
indicated plans for shorter redesign cycles. 
 
However, the agency further recognizes that engineering, planning and financial constraints 
prohibit most technologies from being applied across an entire fleet of vehicles within a year.  
Thus, as for the analysis supporting its 2006 rulemaking regarding light truck CAFE, the agency 
is employing overall constraints on the rates at which each technology can penetrate a 
manufacturer’s fleet.  The Volpe model applies these “phase-in caps” by ceasing to add a given 
technology to a manufacturer’s fleet in a specific model year once it has increased the 
corresponding penetration rate by at least amount of the cap.  Having done so, the model 
proceeds to apply other technologies in lieu of the “capped” technology. 
 
For its regulatory analysis in 2006, NHTSA applied phase-in caps expected to be consistent with 
NAS’ indication in its 2002 report that even existing technologies would require 4 to 8 years to 
achieve widespread penetration of the fleet.  The NAS report, which is believed to be the only 
peer-reviewed source which provides phase-in rates, was relied upon for establishing the phase-
in caps that we used for all technologies, except diesels and hybrids, for which the report didn’t 
include that information.   Most of the phase-in caps applied by the agency in 2006 ranged from 
25 percent (4 year introduction) to 17 percent (approximately 6 years, the midpoint of the NAS 
estimate).  The agency assumed shorter implementation rates for technologies that did not 
require changes to the manufacturing line.  For other technologies (e.g., hybrid and diesel 
powertrains), the agency employed phase-in caps as low as 3 percent, to reflect the major 
redesign efforts and capital investments required to implement these technologies. 
 
Considerable changes have occurred since NHTSA’s 2006 analysis, and even more since the 
2002 NAS report.  Not only have fuel prices increased, but official forecasts of future fuel prices 
have increased, as well.  This suggests a market environment in which consumers are more likely 
to demand fuel-saving technologies than previously anticipated, and it suggests a financial 
environment in which investors are more likely to invest in companies developing and producing 
such technologies.  Indeed, some technologies have penetrated the marketplace more quickly 
than projected in 2006. Confidential product plan information submitted to NHTSA in 2007 and 
information from suppliers confirm that the rate of technology penetration has increased as 
compared to 2006. 
 
Also, the statutory environment has changed since 2006.  With the enactment of EISA, Congress 
has adopted the specific objectives of increasing new vehicle fuel economy to at least 35 mpg by 
2020 and making ratable progress toward that objective in earlier model years.  This reduces 
manufacturers’ uncertainty about the general direction of future fuel economy standards in the 
United States.  Moreover, developments in other regions (e.g., Europe) and countries (e.g., 
Canada and China) suggest that the generalized expectation that future vehicles will perform 
well with respect to energy efficiency is not unique to the United States.  Discussions with 
manufacturers in late 2007 and early 2008 indicate that the industry is highly sensitive to all of 
these developments and has been anticipating the need to accelerate the rate of technology 
deployment in response to the passage of major energy legislation in the U.S. 
  
V-51  
 
Considering these developments, the agency revisited the phase-in caps it had applied in 2006 
and determined that it would be appropriate to relax many of them.  In our judgment, most of the 
engine technologies could penetrate the fleet in as quickly as five years—rather than in the six 
we previously estimated—as long as they are applied during redesign.  Low friction lubricants 
are already widely used, and our expectation is that they can quickly penetrate the remainder of 
the fleet.  Therefore, we relaxed the 25 percent (4-year) phase-in cap to 50 percent (2 years).  
Similarly, product plans indicate that transmissions with 5 or more forward gears will widely 
penetrate the fleet even without the current proposal.  Also, given the technology cost and 
effectiveness estimates discussed above, the Volpe model frequently estimates that 
manufacturers will “leapfrog” past 5-speed transmissions to apply more advanced transmissions 
(e.g., 6-speed or AMT).  We have therefore increased the phase-in cap for 5-speed transmissions 
from 25 percent (4 years) to 100 percent (1 year).  However, in our judgment, phase-in caps of 
17 percent (6 years) are currently still appropriate for most other transmission technologies. 
 
Although NHTSA has applied phase-in caps of 25 percent (4 years) for most remaining 
technologies, we continue to anticipate that phase-in caps of 3 percent are appropriate for some 
advanced technologies, such as hybrids and diesels.    Although engine, vehicle, and exhaust 
aftertreatment manufacturers have, more recently, expressed greater optimism than before 
regarding the outlook for light vehicle diesel engines, our expectation is that the phase-in cap that 
we have chosen is appropriate at this time.  We also estimate that a 3 percent rate is appropriate 
for hybrid technologies, which are very complex, require significant engineering resources to 
implement, but are just now starting to penetrate the market. 
 
Table 9 below presents the phase-in caps applied in the current analysis, with rates from the 
analysis of the 2006 final rule provided for comparison. NHTSA requests comments on the 
phase-in caps shown here, and on whether slower or faster rates would be more appropriate and, 
if so, why.

B.   The Volpe model 
 
1.   What is the Volpe model? 
 
As it did for the development and analysis of the April 2006 light truck final rule, in developing 
this proposal NHTSA made significant use of a peer-reviewed modeling system developed by 
the Department of Transportation’s Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe 
Center).  The CAFE Compliance and Effects Modeling System (referred to herein as the Volpe 
model) serves two fundamental purposes:  identifying technologies each manufacturer could 
apply in order to comply with a specified set of CAFE standards, and calculating the costs and 
effects of manufacturers’ application of technologies. 
 
Before working with the Volpe Center to develop and apply this model, NHTSA had considered 
other options, including other modeling systems.  NHTSA was unable to identify any other 
system that could operate at a sufficient level of detail with respect to manufacturers’ future 
products, which involve thousands of unique vehicle models using hundreds of unique engines 
and hundreds of unique transmissions.  NHTSA was also unable to identify any other system that 
  
V-53  
could simulate a range of different possible reforms to CAFE standards.  The Volpe model 
provides these and other capabilities, and helps NHTSA examine potential regulatory options. 
 
2.   How does the Volpe model apply technologies to manufacturers’ future fleets? 
 
The Volpe model begins with an “initial state” of the domestic vehicle market, which in this case 
is the market for passenger cars and light trucks to be sold during the period covered by the 
proposed rule.  The vehicle market is defined on a model-by-model, engine-by-engine, and 
transmission-by-transmission basis, such that each defined vehicle model refers to a separately-
defined engine and a separately-defined transmission. 
 
For the model years covered by the current proposal, the light vehicle (passenger car and light 
truck) market forecast included more than 3,000 vehicle models, more than 400 specific engines, 
and nearly 400 specific transmissions.57  This level of detail in the representation of the vehicle 
market is vital to an accurate analysis of manufacturer-specific costs and the analysis of reformed 
CAFE standards, and is much greater than the level of detail used by many other models and 
analyses relevant to light vehicle fuel economy.  Because CAFE standards apply to the average 
performance of each manufacturer’s fleets of cars and light trucks, the impact of potential 
standards on individual manufacturers cannot be credibly estimated without analysis of 
manufacturers’ planned fleets.  NHTSA has used this level of detail in CAFE analysis 
throughout the history of the program.  Furthermore, because required CAFE levels under an 
attribute-based CAFE standard depend on manufacturers’ fleet composition, the stringency of an 
attribute-based standard cannot be predicted without performing analysis at this level of detail. 
 
Examples of other models and analyses that NHTSA and Volpe Center staff have considered 
include DOE’s NEMS, Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s (ORNL) Transitional Alternative Fuels 
and Vehicles (TAFV) model, and the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) analysis 
supporting California’s adopted greenhouse gas emissions standards for light vehicles. 
 
DOE’s NEMS represents the light-duty fleet in terms of four “manufacturers” (domestic cars, 
imported cars, domestic light trucks, and imported light trucks), twelve vehicle market classes 
(e.g., “standard pickup”), and sixteen power train/fuel combinations (e.g., methanol fuel-cell 
vehicle).58  Therefore, as currently structured, NEMS is unable to estimate manufacturer-specific 
implications of attribute-based CAFE standards. 
 
                                                 
57 The market forecast is an input to the Volpe model developed by NHTSA using product plan information 
provided to the agency by individual vehicle manufacturers in response to NHTSA’s requests.  The submitted 
product plans contain confidential business information (CBI), which the agency is prohibited by federal law from 
disclosing.  As the agency receives new product plan information in response to future requests, the market forecast 
is updated.

Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc.’s (EEA’s) Fuel Economy Regulatory Analysis Model (FERAM).  
However, FERAM documentation and source code have not been made available to NHTSA or Volpe Center staff. 
  
V-54  
TAFV accounts for many power train/fuel combinations, having been originally designed to aid 
understanding of possible transitions to alternative fueled vehicles, but it represents the light-
duty fleet as four aggregated (i.e., industry-wide) categories of vehicles:  small cars, large cars, 
small light trucks, and large light trucks.59  Thus, again, as currently structure, TAFV is unable to 
estimate manufacturer-specific implications of attribute-based CAFE standards. 
 
CARB’s analysis of light vehicle GHG emissions standards uses two levels of accounting.  First, 
based on a report prepared for Northeast States Center for a Clean Air Future (NESCCAF), 
CARB represents the light-duty fleet in terms of five “representative” vehicles.  Use of these 
“representative” vehicles ignores the fact that the engineering characteristics of individual 
vehicle models vary widely both among manufacturers and within manufacturers’ individual 
fleets.  For each of these five vehicles, NESCCAF’s report contains the results of full vehicle 
simulation given several pre-specified technology “packages.”60  Second, to evaluate 
manufacturer-specific regulatory costs, CARB essentially reduces each manufacturer’s fleet to 
only two average test weights, one for each of California’s two regulatory classes.61  Even for a 
flat standard such as considered by California, NHTSA would not base its analysis of 
manufacturer-level costs on this level of aggregation.  Use of CARB’s methods would not enable 
NHTSA to estimate manufacturer-specific implications of the attribute-based CAFE standards 
proposed today.62 
 
The Volpe model also uses several additional categories of data and estimates provided in 
various external input files: 
 
One input file specifies the characteristics of fuel-saving technologies to be represented, and 
includes, for each technology, the first year in which the technology is expected to be ready for 
commercial application; upper and lower estimates of the effectiveness and cost (retail price 
equivalent) of the technology; coefficients defining the extent to which costs are expected to 
decline as a result of “learning effects” (discussed below); inclusion or exclusion of the 
technology on up to three technology “paths”; and constraints (“phase-in caps”) on the annual 
rate at which manufacturers are estimated to be able to increase the technology’s penetration 
rate.  These technology characteristics and estimates are specified separately for each of the 
following categories of vehicles:  small sport/utility vehicles (SUVs), midsize SUVs, large 
SUVs, small pickups, large pickups, minivans, subcompact cars, compact cars, midsize cars, and

large cars.  In addition, the input file defining technology characteristics can (but need not) 
contain specified “synergies” between technologies—that is, differences in a given technology’s 
effect on fuel consumption that result from the presence of other technologies. 
 
Another input file specifies vehicular emission rates for the following pollutants:  carbon 
monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter 
(PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).  These rates are defined on a model year-by-model year and 
calendar year-by-calendar year basis, and are used to estimate changes in emissions that result 
from changes in vehicular travel (i.e., vehicle-miles traveled or VMT). 
 
A third input file specifies a variety of economic and other data and estimates.  The model can 
accommodate vehicle survival (i.e., percent of vehicles of a given vintage that remain in service) 
and mileage accumulation (i.e., annual travel by vehicles of a given vintage) rates extending as 
many years beyond the year of sale as for which estimates are available and use those for 
estimating VMT, fuel consumption, and emissions.  The model can also accommodate forecasts 
of price and fuel taxation rates for up to seven fuels (e.g., gasoline, diesel) over a similar period.  
The model uses pump prices (i.e., including taxes) to estimate the value manufacturers expect 
vehicle purchasers to place on saved fuel, because they indicate the amount by which the 
manufacturer is expected to consider itself able to increase the retail price of the vehicle based on 
the purchaser’s consideration of the vehicle’s increased fuel economy.  However, the model uses 
pretax fuel prices to estimate the monetized societal benefits of reduced fuel consumption, 
because fuel taxes represent transfers of resources from fuel buyers to government agencies 
rather than real resources that are consumed in the process of supplying or using fuel, so their 
value must be deducted from retail fuel prices to determine the value of fuel savings to the U.S. 
economy.  
 
Other economic inputs include the rebound effect coefficient (i.e., the elasticity of VMT with 
respect to the per-mile cost of fuel); the discount rate; the “payback period” (i.e., the number of 
years manufacturers are estimated to assume vehicle purchasers consider when taking into 
account fuel savings); the “gap” between laboratory and actual fuel economy; the per-vehicle 
value of travel time (in dollars per hour); the economic costs (in dollars per gallon) of petroleum 
consumption; various external costs (all in dollars per mile) associated with changes in vehicle 
use; damage costs (all on a dollar per ton basis) for each of the above-mentioned criteria 
pollutants; and the rate at which noncompliance causes civil penalties.  Section V.A.4 below 
describes in much more detail how these inputs are included and used by the model. 
 
The model also accommodates input data and estimates addressing the properties of different 
fuels.  These include upstream carbon dioxide and criteria pollutant emission rates (i.e., U.S. 
emissions resulting from the production and distribution of each fuel), density (pounds/gallon), 
energy density (BTU/gallon), carbon content, shares of fuel savings leading to reduced domestic 
refining, and relative shares of different gasoline blends.  These fuel properties and related 
estimates are used to calculate changes in domestic upstream emissions resulting from changes 
in fuel consumption. 
 
Coefficients defining the probability distributions to apply when performing sensitivity analysis 
(i.e., Monte Carlo simulation) are also specified in this input file.  These coefficients determine 
  
V-56  
the likelihood that any given value will be selected when performing this type of analysis (e.g., 
the likelihood that a rebound effect of -0.1 will be tested).  High and low fuel price forecasts are 
also specified in this input file for this purpose. 
 
The final input file contains CAFE scenarios to be examined.  The model accommodates a 
baseline (i.e., business-as-usual) scenario and different alternative scenarios.  Effects of the 
alternative scenarios are calculated relative to results for the baseline scenario.  Each scenario 
defines the coverage, structure, and stringency of CAFE standards for each of the covered model 
years. 
 
With all of the above input data and estimates, the modeling system develops an estimate of a set 
of technologies each manufacturer could apply in response to each specified CAFE scenario.  
Because manufacturers have many choices regarding how to respond to CAFE standards, it is 
impossible to predict precisely how a given manufacturer would respond to a given set of 
standards.  The modeling system begins with the “initial state” (i.e., business-as-usual) of each 
manufacturer’s future vehicles, and accumulates the estimated costs of progressive additions of 
fuel-saving technologies.  Within a set of specified constraints, the system adds technologies 
following a cost-minimizing approach, because this is what NHTSA expects a manufacturer 
would do in real life.  At each step, the system evaluates the effective cost of applying available 
technologies to individual vehicle models, engines, or transmissions, and selects the application 
of technology that produces the lowest effective cost.  The effective cost estimated to be 
considered by the manufacturer is calculated by adding the total incurred technology costs (in 
retail price equivalent or RPE), subtracting the reduction in civil penalties owed for 
noncompliance with the CAFE standard, subtracting the estimated value63 of the reduction in 
fuel costs, and dividing the result by the number of affected vehicles. 
 
In representing manufacturer decision-making in response to a given CAFE standard, the 
modeling system accounts for the fact that historically some manufacturers have been unwilling 
to pay penalties and some have been willing to do so.  Thus, the system applies technologies 
until any of the following conditions are met:  the manufacturer no longer owes civil penalties 
for failing to meet the applicable standard, the manufacturer has exhausted technologies expected 
to be available in that model year, or the manufacturer is estimated to be willing to pay civil 
penalties, and doing so is estimated to be less expensive than continuing to add technologies.  
The system then progresses to the next model year (if included in the vehicle market and 
scenario input files), “carrying over” technologies where vehicle models are projected to be 
succeeded by other vehicle models.64 
 
In the modeling system, this “compliance simulation” is constrained in several ways.  First, 
technologies are defined as being applicable or not applicable to each of the ten vehicle 
categories listed above.  The vehicle market forecast input file may also define some 
                                                 
63 The estimated value of the reduction in fuel costs represents the amount by which the manufacturer is expected to 
consider itself able to increase the retail price of the vehicle based on the purchaser’s consideration of the vehicle’s 
increased fuel economy.  This calculation considers the change in the discounted outlays for fuel (and fuel taxes) 
during a “payback period” specified as an input to the model. 
64 For example, if Honda is expected to produce the Civic in 2012 and 2013, a version of the Civic estimated to be 
produced in 2013 may carry over technologies from a version of the Civic produced in 2012 if the latter is identified 
as a “predecessor” of the former. 
  
V-57  
technologies as being already present or not applicable to specific vehicles, engines or 
transmissions.  For example, a manufacturer may have indicated it plans to use low-drag brakes 
on some specific vehicle model, or NHTSA may expect that another manufacturer is not likely to 
apply a 7- or 8-speed transmission after it installs a 6-speed transmission on a vehicle.  Second, 
some technologies are subject to specific “engineering constraints.”  For example, secondary-
axle disconnect can only be applied to vehicles with four-wheel (or all-wheel) drive.  Third, 
some technologies (e.g., conversion from pushrod valve actuation to overhead cam actuation) are 
nearly always applied only when the vehicle is expected to be redesigned and others (e.g., 
cylinder deactivation) are applied only when the vehicle is expected to be refreshed or 
redesigned, so the model will only apply them at those particular points.  Fourth, once the system 
applies a given technology to a percentage of a given manufacturers’ fleet exceeding a specified 
phase-in cap, the system instead applies other technologies.  The third and fourth of these 
constraints are intended to produce results consistent with manufacturers’ product planning 
practices and with limitations on how quickly technologies can penetrate the fleet. 
 
One important aspect of this compliance simulation is that it does not attempt to account for 
either CAFE credits or intentional over-compliance.  In the real world, manufacturers may earn 
CAFE credits by selling flex-fueled vehicles (FFVs) and/or by exceeding CAFE standards, and 
may, within limitations, count those credits toward compliance in future or prior model years.  
However, EPCA and EISA do not allow NHTSA to consider these flexibilities in setting the 
standards.  Therefore, the Volpe model does not attempt to account for these flexibilities. 
 
Another possibility NHTSA and Volpe Center staff have considered, but do not yet know how to 
analyze, is the potential that manufacturers might “pull ahead” the implementation of some 
technologies in response to CAFE standards known to be increasing over time.  For example, if a 
manufacturer plans to redesign many vehicles in MY2011 and not in MY2013, but the standard 
in MY2013 is considerably higher in MY2013 than in MY2011, the manufacturer might find it 
less expensive during MY2011-MY2013 (taken together) to apply more technology in MY2011 
than is necessary for compliance with the MY2011 standard.  Under some circumstances, doing 
so might make sense even setting aside the potential to earn and bank CAFE credits. 
 
NHTSA and Volpe Center staff have discussed the potential to represent this type of response, 
but have thus far encountered two challenges.  First, NHTSA is not certain that in determining 
the maximum feasible standard in a given model year, it would be appropriate to count on 
manufacturers overcomplying with standards in preceding model years.  Second, considering 
other inter-model year dependencies (e.g., technologies that carry over between model years, 
phase-in caps that accumulate across model years, volume-based learning curves), Volpe Center 
staff currently anticipate that some iterative procedure would likely be required.  Also, the 
agency wonders whether trying to represent this type of response would require make undue 
implicit assumptions regarding manufacturers’ ability to predict future market conditions.  
Although NHTSA and Volpe Center staff will continue to explore the potential to represent 
inter-model year timing, it is not yet clear that it will be appropriate and feasible to do so in the 
near term. 
 
The agency requests comment on the appropriateness under EPCA of considering (in the 
standard-setting context) this type of anticipatory application of technology.  The agency further 
  
V-58  
requests comment on appropriate methodologies for representing such decisions by 
manufacturers. 
 
3.   What effects does the Volpe model estimate? 
   
Having completed this compliance simulation for all manufacturers and all model years, the 
system calculates the total cost of all applied technologies, as well as a variety of effects of 
changes in fuel economy.  The system calculates year-by-year mileage accumulation, taking into 
account any increased driving estimated to result from the rebound effect.  Based on the 
calculated mileage accumulation and on fuel economy and the estimated gap between laboratory 
and actual fuel economy, the system calculates year-by-year fuel consumption.  Based on 
calculated mileage accumulation and fuel consumption, and on specified emission factors, the 
system calculates future full fuel-cycle domestic carbon dioxide and criteria pollutant emissions.  
The system calculates total discounted and undiscounted national societal costs of year-by-year 
fuel consumption, taking into account estimated future fuel prices (before taxes) and the 
estimated economic externalities of fuel consumption.  Based on changes in year-by-year 
mileage accumulation, the system calculates changes in consumer surplus related to additional 
travel, as well as economic externalities related to additional congestion, accidents, and noise 
stemming from additional travel.  The system calculates the value of time saved because 
increases in fuel economy produce increases in driving range, thereby reducing the frequency 
with which some vehicles require refueling.  The system calculates the monetary value of 
damages resulting from criteria pollutants.  Finally, the system accumulates all discounted and 
undiscounted societal benefits of each scenario as compared to the baseline scenario.  For each 
model year, the system compares total incurred technology costs to the total present value of 
societal benefits for each model year, calculating net societal benefits (i.e., discounted societal 
benefits minus total incurred technology costs) and the benefit-cost ratio (i.e., discounted societal 
benefits divided by total incurred technology costs). 
 
One important effect not currently estimated by the Volpe model is the market response to 
CAFE-induced changes in vehicle prices and fuel economy levels.  NHTSA and Volpe Center 
staff have considered developing and applying a market share model capable of estimating 
changes in sales of individual vehicle models.  Doing so would allow estimation of the feedback 
between market shifts and CAFE requirements.  For example, if the relative market share of 
vehicles with small footprints increases, the average required CAFE level under a footprint-
based standard will also increase. 
 
In an early experimental version of the Volpe model, Volpe Center staff included a market share 
model using a nested multinomial logit specification to calculate model-by-model changes in 
sales volumes.  This allowed the Volpe model to calculate the resulting changes in 
manufacturers’ required CAFE levels, and to seek iteratively a solution at which prices, fuel 
economy levels, sales volumes, and required CAFE levels converged to stable values.  Although 
the market share model appeared to operate properly (and to converge rapidly), Volpe Center 
staff suspended its development because of three challenges: 
 
First, Volpe Center staff were not successful in calibrating a logically consistent set of 
coefficients for the underlying multinomial logit model.  The analysis, performed using 
  
V-59  
information from a known (2002 model year) fleet, consistently yielded one or more coefficients 
that were either directionally incorrect (e.g., indicating that some attributes actually detract from 
value) or implausibly large (e.g., indicating that some attributes were of overwhelming value).  
Although Volpe Center staff tested many different specifications of the market share model, 
none produced results that appeared to merit further consideration. 
 
Second, NHTSA and Volpe Center staff are not confident that baseline sales prices for individual 
vehicle models, which would be required by a market share model, can be reliably predicted.  
Although NHTSA requests that manufacturers include planned MSRPs in product plans 
submitted to NHTSA, MSRPs do not include the effect of various sales incentives that can 
change actual selling prices.  The availability and dollar value of suchincentives have been 
observed to vary considerably, but not necessarily predictably. 
 
Finally, before applying a market share model, it would be necessary to estimate how 
manufacturers would allocate compliance costs among vehicle models.  Although one obvious 
approach would be to assume that all costs would be passed through in the form of higher prices 
for those vehicle models with improved fuel economy, other approaches are perhaps equally 
plausible.  For example, a manufacturer might shift compliance costs toward high-demand 
vehicles in order to better compete in certain market segments.  Although the above-mentioned 
experimental version of the Volpe model included a “cost allocation” model that offered several 
different allocation options, NHTSA and Volpe Center staff never achieved confidence that these 
aspects of manufacturer decisions could be reasonably estimated. 
 
NHTSA and Volpe Center staff are continuing to explore options for including these types of 
effects.  At the same time, EPA has contracted with Resources for the Future (RFF) to develop a 
potential market share model.  Depending on the extent to which these efforts are successful, the 
Volpe model could at some point be modified to include cost allocation and market share 
models.  NHTSA seeks comment on possible methodologies for incorporating market responses 
to CAFE-induced changes in vehicle price and fuel economy in the Volpe model.  In particular, 
NHTSA seeks comments addressing the concerns identified above regarding the formulation and 
calibration of a market share model, the estimation of future vehicle prices, and the estimation of 
manufacturers’ decisions regarding the allocation of compliance costs. 
 
4.   How can the Volpe model be used to calibrate and evaluate potential CAFE 
standards? 
   
The modeling system can also be applied in a more highly-automated mode whereby the optimal 
shape of an attribute-based CAFE standard may be estimated and its stringency may be set at a 
level that produces a specified total technology cost or average required CAFE level among a 
specified set of manufacturers, or that is estimated to maximize net societal benefits.  The first 
step in this operating mode involves identifying manufacturer-by-manufacturer CAFE levels at 
which societal benefits are estimated to be maximized.  The second step involves combining the 
resultant fleets and statistically fitting a constrained logistic curve of the following form:

Here, TARGET is the fuel economy target (in mpg) applicable to vehicles of a given footprint 
(FOOTPRINT, in square feet), LIMITLOWER and LIMITUPPER are the function’s lower and upper 
asymptotes (also in mpg), e is approximately equal to 2.718,65 MIDPOINT is the footprint (in 
square feet) at which the inverse of the fuel economy target falls halfway between the inverses of 
the lower and upper asymptotes, and WIDTH is a parameter (in square feet) that determines how 
gradually the fuel economy target transitions from the upper toward the lower asymptote as the 
footprint increases.  Figure V-2 below shows an example of a logistic target function, where 
LIMITLOWER = 20 mpg, LIMITUPPER = 30 mpg, MIDPOINT = 40 square feet, and WIDTH = 5 
square feet:

The lower asymptote is determined by calculating the average fuel economy of the largest 
vehicles in the “socially optimized” fleet discussed above, where the percentage of the fleet to 
consider is specified externally.  Similarly, the upper asymptote is determined by calculating the 
average fuel economy of the smallest vehicles in the same fleet.  Initial values of the other two 
                                                 
65 The number e is one of the most important numbers in mathematics and statistics.  The function has a hockey 
stick appearance when plotted.  The value of e itself is a never ending number whose first 8 digits equal 2.7182818.  
NHTSA uses it here because it occurs in many natural processes and tends to fit data well. In the last light truck 
rulemaking, NHTSA examined several functional forms that did not rely on e, but they were judged not to provide 
as good a fit for the data.  We are using the same conclusion here. 
  
V-61  
coefficients of the logistic function are determined through a standard statistical technique 
(nonlinear least-square regression), except as discussed in sections V and VI below regarding the 
adjusting of the original curve for the passenger car function. 
 
Following this initial calibration of the target function, the system adjusts the lower and upper 
asymptotes uniformly (on a gallon per mile basis) until one of the following externally specified 
conditions is met:  the average CAFE level required of the included manufacturers 
approximately equals an externally specified goal; net societal benefits (i.e., total benefits minus 
total costs) are maximized, or total benefits are as close as observed (among evaluated stringency 
levels) to total costs.  Due to rounding of fuel economy and CAFE levels, the first condition can 
only be satisfied on an approximate basis. 
 
The modeling system provides another type of higher-level automation—the ability to perform 
uncertainty analysis, also referred to as Monte Carlo simulation.  For some input parameters, 
such as technology costs, values can be tested over a specified continuous probability 
distribution.  For others, such as fuel prices, discrete scenarios (e.g., high, low, and reference 
cases), each with a specified probability, can be tested.  The system performs sensitivity analysis 
by randomly selecting values for parameters to be varied, performing the compliance simulation 
and effects calculations, repeating these results many times and recording results for external 
analysis.  This operating mode enables the examination of the uncertainty of high-level results 
(e.g., total costs, fuel savings, or net societal benefits), as well as their sensitivity to variations in 
the model’s input parameters. 
 
5.   How has the Volpe model been updated since the April 2006 light truck CAFE final 
rule? 
 
Several changes were made to the Volpe model between the analysis reported in the April 2006 
light truck final rule and the analysis of the current NPRM.  As discussed above, the set of 
technologies represented was updated, the logical sequence for progressing through these 
technologies was changed, methods to account for “synergies” (i.e., interactions) between 
technologies and technology cost reductions associated with a manufacturer’s “learning” were 
added, the effective cost calculation used in the technology application algorithm was modified, 
and the procedure for calibrating a reformed standard was changed, as was the procedure for 
estimating the optimal stringency of a reformed standard. 
 
As discussed in Section III above, the set of technologies considered by the agency has evolved since 
the previous light truck CAFE rulemaking.  The set of technologies now included in the Volpe model 
is shown below in Table V-7, with codes used by the model to refer to each technology.

The logical sequence for progressing between these technologies has also been changed.  As in the 
previous version of the Volpe model, technologies are assigned to groups (e.g., engine technologies) 
and the model follows a cost-minimizing approach to selecting technologies.  However, the model 
now includes some “branch points” at which it selects from two or more technologies within the same 
group.  This enables a more detailed representation of some technologies that have multiple variants 
(e.g., variable valve timing) and, as relevant to the applicability of different technologies, more 
specific differentiation between technologies that have already been applied to vehicles (e.g., single 
versus dual overhead cam engines).  This revised logical sequencing is expected to produce results that 
are more realistic in terms of the application of technologies to different vehicle models.  For example, 
in this analysis OHV engines and OHC engines were considered separately, and the model was 
generally not allowed to apply multivalve OHC technology to OHV engines (except where continuous 
variable valve timing and lift is applied to OHV engines, in which case the model assumes conversion 
to DOHC valvetrain). 
 
Figure V-3 below shows the resultant “decision tree” for the group of engine technologies.  As an 
example of the “branching” mentioned above, having applied cylinder deactivation and coupled cam 
phasing to an overhead valve engine, the Volpe model selects either discrete valve lift or an engine 
redesign to multivalve overhead cam with continuous variable valve Figure V-4 shows the decision 
tree for transmission technologies, and Figure V-5 shows the decision trees for other technologies.

Each time the model applies a technology to a vehicle in the fleet, it considers the next available 
technology on every available path.  An available technology is one that is not included in the base 
vehicle, has not been applied by the model, and is not disqualified due to the vehicle’s characteristics 
(discussed below).  For a given path, the next available technology is the first available item (if no 
technologies on the path have yet been applied) or the first available item following the most recently 
applied technology on that path.  An available path is any path that includes available technologies. 
 
The engine and transmission paths contain several forks where the model may choose among two or 
more same-path items along with items from other paths.  At some of these forks, conditions on the 
connecting arrows require the model to follow a particular branch.  These conditions are based on 
previously applied technologies or vehicle characteristics.  For example, ladder frame vehicles must 
follow the left branch of the transmission technology path, whereas unibody vehicles can follow either 
the right or left branch.  The consequence is that the model considers both aggressive shift logic (ASL) 
  
V-67  
and CVT for unibody vehicles, but only ASL for ladder frame vehicles.  Conditions along the engine 
technologies path are based on valvetrain design (OHV, OHC, SOHC, and DOHC). 
 Other conditions require the model to discontinue considering technologies along a given path.  
For example, 2-Mode Hybrid and Power Split Hybrid drivetrains can be applied only to vehicles 
equipped with automatic transmissions.  If the model has already chosen a manual transmission and 
IMA/ISAD/BSG Hybrid drivetrain (or if the base vehicle is equipped with these), the hybrid path 
becomes unavailable and the model must choose subsequent technologies from other paths. 
a. Technology synergies 
In some cases, the change in fuel economy achieved by applying a given technology depends 
on what other technologies are already present.  The Volpe model has been modified to provide the 
ability to represent such “synergies” between technologies, as discussed above.  These effects are 
specified in one of the model’s input files.  As shown below in Table V-8, which uses technology 
codes listed in Table V-7 above, most of the synergies represented in the analysis of this proposal are 
negative.  In other words, most of the interactions are such that a given technology has a smaller effect 
on fuel economy if some other technologies have already been applied.  The inclusion of such effects 
in the model is expected to produce more realistic estimates of the benefit of applying various 
technologies.

b. Technology learning curves 
 
The Volpe model has also been modified to provide the ability to account for cost reductions a 
manufacturer may realize through learning achieved from experience in actually applying a 
given technology.  Thus, for some of the technologies, we have included a learning factor.  
Stated another way, the “learning curve” describes the reduction in unit production costs as a 
function of accumulated production volume and small redesigns that reduce costs.   
 
As explained above, a typical learning curve can be described by three parameters: (1) the initial 
production volume before cost reductions begin to be realized; (2) the rate at which cost 
reductions occur with increases in cumulative production beyond this initial volume (usually 
referred to as the “learning rate”); and (3) the production volume after which costs reach a 
  
V-72  
“floor,” and further cost reductions no longer occur.  Over the region where costs decline with 
accumulating production volume, an experience curve can be expressed as C(Q) = aQ-b, where a 
is a constant coefficient, Q represents cumulative production, and b is a coefficient 
corresponding to the assumed learning rate.  In turn, the learning rate L, which  is usually 
expressed as the percent by which average unit cost declines with a doubling of cumulative 
production, and is related to the value of the coefficient b by L = 100*(1 – 2-b).66 
 
The new learning curves are described in greater detail above in the Proposed Technology 
Assumptions section, III.  We seek comment on the new proposed learning curves. 
 
c. Calibration of reformed CAFE standards 
 
The procedure used by the Volpe model to develop (i.e., calibrate) the initial shape of a reformed 
standard was also modified.  In the version of the model used to analyze NHTSA’s April 2006 light 
truck final rule, the asymptotes for the constrained logistic function defining fuel economy targets 
were assigned based on the set of vehicles that would have been assigned to the lowest and highest 
bins defined in that rule’s 2005 NPRM.  The Volpe model has been modified to accept specified 
percentages (in terms of either models or sales) of the fleet to include when assigning asymptotes. 
 
The procedure used by the Volpe model to estimate the “socially optimized” stringency of a reformed 
standard was also modified.  In the version of the model used to analyze the 2006 light truck final rule, 
the shape of the function (i.e., the constrained logistic function) defining fuel economy targets was 
recalibrated every model year and then shifted up and down to estimate the stringency at which 
marginal costs begin to exceed marginal benefits or, equivalently, the point at which net societal 
benefits are maximized.  However, analysis conducted by the agency to prepare for the current 
rulemaking revealed several opportunities to refine the procedure described above before applying it to 
an action that spans several model years.  The first refinement is a method for gradually transforming 
the shape of the continuous function between model years and guarding against erratic fluctuations in 
the shape (though not necessarily the stringency) of the continuous function.  The second is the 
implementation of several anti-backsliding measures that prevents the average required CAFE level 
from falling between model years and prevents the continuous function for a given model from 
crossing or falling below that of the preceding model year.  The third, applied to passenger cars only, 
is an option to specify a fixed relationship between the function’s midpoint and width coefficients.  
These refinements are discussed in greater detail in Section V.B below. 
 
6.   What manufacturer information does the Volpe model use? 
 
For purposes of determining and analyzing CAFE standards, NHTSA has historically made 
significant use of detailed product plan information provided to the agency by individual 
manufacturers, supplementing this information where appropriate with information from other 
                                                 
66 See, e.g., Robert H. Williams, “Toward Cost Buydown via Learning-by-Doing for Environmental Energy 
Technologies,” paper presented at Workshop on Learning-by-Doing in Energy Technologies, Resources for the 
Future, Washington, DC, June 17-18, 2003, pp. 1-2.  Another common but equivalent formulation of the relationship 
between L and b is (1-L)=2-b, where (1-L) is referred to as the progress ratio; see Richard P. Rumelt, “Note on 
Strategic Cost Dynamics,” POL 2001-1.1, Anderson School of Business, University of California, Los Angeles, 
California, 2001, pp. 4-5.  
  
V-73  
sources, such as data submitted to the agency in relation to CAFE compliance.  Consistent with 
this practice, the Volpe model uses detailed representations of (i.e., model-by-model, linked to 
specific engines and transmissions) the fleets manufacturers are expected to produce for sale in 
the U.S.  In preparation for today’s action, the agency issued in the spring of 2006 a request that 
manufacturers provide updated product plans for passenger cars and light trucks. 
 
NHTSA received product plan information from Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, 
Mitsubishi, Porsche and Toyota.  The agency didn’t receive any product plan information from 
BMW, Ferrari, Hyundai, Mercedes or VW.   
 
Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Porsche and Toyota provided information 
covering multiple model years.  However, only Chrysler and Mitsubishi provided us with 
product plans that showed differing production quantities, vehicle introductions, vehicle 
redesigns/refreshes changes, without any carryover production quantities, from 2007 to MY 
2015.  The agency incorporated their product plan information as part of the input file to the 
model without the need to project or carryover any vehicle production data. 
 
For the other companies which provided data, the agency carried over production quantities for 
their vehicles, allowing for growth, starting with the year after their product plan data showed 
changes in production quantities or showed the introduction or redesign/refresh of vehicles.  
Product plan information was provided until MY 2013 for Ford and Toyota, thus the first year 
that we started to carry over production quantities for those companies was MY 2014.  Product 
plan information was provided until MY 2012 for GM and Nissan, thus the first year that we 
started to carry over production quantities for those companies was MY 2013. Product plan 
information was provided by Honda until MY 2008.  Honda asked the agency to carry over those 
plans and also provided data for the last redesign of a vehicle and asked us to carry forward. 
 
Product plan information was provided until MY 2008 for Porsche, thus the first year that we 
started to carry over production quantities for Porsche was MY 2009.   
 
For Hyundai, given that it is one of the largest 7 manufacturers, the agency used the mid-year 
2007 data contained in the agency’s CAFE database to establish the baseline models and 
production quantities for their vehicles.  For the other manufacturers, because of the time 
constraint the agency was under to meet the statutory deadline, we used the 2005 information 
from our database, which is the latest information used in the current analysis. To the extent 
possible , because, the CAFE database doesn’t capture all of the product plan data that we 
request from companies, we supplemented the CAFE database information with information on 
public websites, from commercial information sources and for Hyundai, from the MY 2008 – 
2011 light truck rule. 
 
In all cases, manufacturers’ respective sales volumes were normalized to produce passenger car 
and light truck fleets that reflected manufacturers’ MY2006 market shares and to reflect 
passenger car and light truck fleets of projected aggregate volume consistent with forecasts in the 
EIA’s 2007 Annual Energy Outlook.  The agency requests comment on whether alternative 
methods should be used to estimate manufacturers’ market shares and the overall sizes of the 
future passenger car and light truck fleets. 
  
V-74  
 
In a companion notice, the agency is requesting updated product plan information from all 
companies, and as in previous fuel economy rulemakings, we will be using those plans for the 
final rule.  These plans will impact the standards for the final rule.  To that end, the agency is 
requesting that these plans be as detailed and as accurate as possible. 
 
7. What economic information does the Volpe model use? 
 
 
NHTSA’s preliminary analysis of alternative CAFE standards for the model years covered by 
this proposed rulemaking relies on a range of information, economic estimates, and input 
parameters.  This section describes this information and each assumption and specific parameter 
values, and discusses the rationale for tentatively choosing each one.  Similar to the product plan 
information, these economic assumptions play a role in the level of the standards, with some 
having a higher impacts than others.  Outside of the cost of technologies and as discussed below, 
the price of gasoline and discount rate used for discounting future benefits account for the 
majority of the impacts.   The agency seeks comment on the economic assumptions presented 
below. The agency seeks comment on the economic assumptions presented below.  For the

a. Costs of fuel economy technologies 
 
We developed detailed estimates of the costs of applying fuel economy-improving technologies 
to vehicle models for use in analyzing the impacts of alternative standards considered in this 
rulemaking.  The estimates were based on those reported by the 2002 NAS Report analyzing 
costs for increasing fuel economy, but were modified for purposes of this analysis as a result of 
extensive consultations among engineers from NHTSA, EPA, and the Volpe Center.  As part of 
this process, the agency also developed varying cost estimates for applying certain fuel economy 
technologies to vehicles of different sizes and body styles.  We may adjust these cost estimates 
based on comments received to this NPRM. 
 
The technology cost estimates used in this analysis are intended to represent manufacturers’ 
direct costs for high-volume production of vehicles with these technologies and sufficient 
experience with their application so that all cost reductions due to “learning curve” effects have 
been fully realized.  However, NHTSA recognizes that manufacturers’ actual costs for applying 
these technologies to specific vehicle models are likely to include additional outlays for 
accompanying design or engineering changes to each model, development and testing of 
prototype versions, recalibrating engine operating parameters, and integrating the technology 
with other attributes of the vehicle.  Manufacturers may also incur additional corporate overhead, 
marketing, or distribution and selling expenses as a consequence of their efforts to improve the 
fuel economy of individual vehicle models and their overall product lines.  
 
In order to account for these additional costs, NHTSA applies an indirect cost multiplier of 1.5 to 
the estimate of the vehicle manufacturers’ direct costs for producing or acquiring each fuel 
economy-improving/CO2 emission-reducing technology.  Historically, NHTSA has used an 
almost identical multiplier, 1.51, for the markup from variable costs or direct manufacturing 
costs to consumer costs.  This markup takes into account fixed costs, burden, manufacturer’s 
profit, and dealers’ profit.  NHTSA’s methodology for determining this markup was recently 
peer reviewed.67 
 
This estimate was confirmed by Argonne National Laboratory in a recent review of vehicle 
manufacturers’ indirect costs.  The Argonne study was specifically intended to improve the 
accuracy of future cost estimates for production of vehicles that achieve high fuel economy/low 
CO2 emissions by employing many of the same advanced technologies considered in our 
analysis.68  Thus, we believe that its recommendation that a multiplier of 1.5 be applied to direct

V-76  
manufacturing costs to reflect manufacturers’ increased indirect costs for deploying advanced 
fuel economy technologies is appropriate for use in the analysis for this rulemaking.   
 
b. Potential opportunity costs of improved fuel economy 
 
An important concern is whether achieving the fuel economy improvements required by 
alternative CAFE standards would require manufacturers to compromise the performance, 
carrying capacity, safety, or comfort of their vehicle models.  If it did so, the resulting sacrifice 
in the value of these attributes to consumers would represent an additional cost of achieving the 
required improvements in fuel economy, and thus of manufacturers’ compliance with stricter 
CAFE standards.  While exact dollar values of these attributes to consumers are difficult to infer 
from vehicle purchase prices, changing vehicle attributes can affect the utility that vehicles 
provide to their owners, and thus their value to potential buyers. 
 
NHTSA has approached this potential problem by developing tentative cost estimates for fuel 
economy-improving technologies that include any additional manufacturing costs that would be 
necessary to maintain the performance, comfort, capacity, or safety of any light-duty vehicle 
model to which those technologies are applied.  In doing so, we primarily followed the precedent 
established by the 2002 NAS Report, although we updated its assumptions as necessary for the 
purposes of the current rulemaking.  The NAS study estimated “constant performance and 
utility” costs for fuel economy technologies, and NHTSA has used these as the basis for their 
further efforts to develop the technology costs employed in analyzing manufacturer’s costs for 
complying with alternative light truck standards.   
 
NHTSA acknowledges the difficulty of estimating technology costs that include costs for the 
accompanying changes in vehicle design that are necessary to maintain performance, capacity, 
and utility.  However, we believe that our tentative cost estimates for fuel economy/CO2 
emission-reduction technologies should be generally sufficient to prevent significant reductions 
in consumer welfare provided by vehicle models to which manufacturers apply those 
technologies. 
c. The on-road fuel economy “gap” 
 
Actual fuel economy levels achieved by light-duty vehicles in on-road driving fall somewhat 
short of their levels measured under the laboratory-like test conditions used by EPA to establish 
its published fuel economy ratings for different models.  In analyzing the fuel savings from 
alternative CAFE standards, NHTSA has previously adjusted the actual fuel economy 
performance of each light truck model downward from its rated value to reflect the expected size 
of this on-road fuel economy “gap.”  On December 27, 2006, EPA adopted changes to its 
regulations on fuel economy labeling, which were intended to bring vehicles’ rated fuel economy 
levels closer to their actual on-road fuel economy levels.69 
 
In its Final Rule, EPA estimated that actual on-road fuel economy for light-duty vehicles 
averages 20 percent lower than published fuel economy levels.  For example, if the overall EPA 
fuel economy rating of a light truck is 20 mpg, the on-road fuel economy actually achieved by a 
typical driver of that vehicle is expected to be 16 mpg (20*.80).  NHTSA has employed EPA’s 
                                                 
69 71 FR 77871 (Dec. 27, 2006).  
  
V-77  
revised estimate of this on-road fuel economy gap in its analysis of the fuel savings resulting 
from alternative CAFE standards proposed in this rulemaking. 
 
d. Fuel prices and the value of saving fuel 
 
Projected future fuel prices are a critical input into the preliminary economic analysis of 
alternative CAFE standards, because they determine the value of fuel savings both to new 
vehicle buyers and to society.  NHTSA relied on the most recent fuel price projections from the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for this 
analysis.  Specifically, we used the AEO 2008 Early Release forecasts of inflation-adjusted 
(constant-dollar) retail gasoline and diesel fuel prices, which represent the EIA’s most up-to-date 
estimate of the most likely course of future prices for petroleum products.70  Federal government 
agencies generally use EIA’s projections in their assessments of future energy-related policies.   
 
The retail fuel price forecasts presented in AEO 2008 span the period from 2008 through 2030.  
Measured in constant 2006 dollars, the Reference Case forecast of retail gasoline prices during 
calendar year 2020 is $2.30 per gallon, rising gradually to $2.49 by the year 2030.  However, 
valuing fuel savings over the 36-year maximum lifetime of light trucks assumed in this analysis 
requires fuel price forecasts that extend through 2050, the last year during which a significant 
number of MY 2015 vehicles will remain in service.71  To obtain fuel price forecasts for the 
years 2031 through 2050, the agency assumes that retail fuel prices forecast in the Reference 
Case for 2030 will remain constant (in 2006 dollars) through 2050.  
 
The value of fuel savings resulting from improved fuel economy/reduced CO2 emissions to 
buyers of light-duty vehicles is determined by the retail price of fuel, which includes federal, 
state, and any local taxes imposed on fuel sales.  Total taxes on gasoline averaged $0.47 per 
gallon during 2006, while those levied on diesel averaged $0.53.  State fuel taxes are weighted 
by sales.  Because fuel taxes represent transfers of resources from fuel buyers to government 
agencies, however, rather than real resources that are consumed in the process of supplying or 
using fuel, their value must be deducted from retail fuel prices to determine the value of fuel 
savings resulting from more stringent CAFE standards to the U.S. economy as a whole.  
 
In estimating the economy-wide or “social” value of fuel savings of increasing CAFE/reducing 
CO2 emissions levels, NHTSA assumes that current fuel taxes will remain constant in real or 
inflation-adjusted terms over the lifetimes of the vehicles proposed to be regulated.  In effect, 
this assumes that the average value per gallon of taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel levied by all 
levels of government will rise at the rate of inflation over that period.  This value is deducted 
from each future year’s forecast of retail gasoline and diesel prices reported in AEO 2008 to 
determine the social value of each gallon of fuel saved during that year as a result of improved 
fuel economy/reduced CO2 emissions.  Subtracting fuel taxes results in a projected value for 
saving gasoline of $1.83 per gallon during 2020, rising to $2.02 per gallon by the year 2030. 
                                                 
70 Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook 2008, Early Release  Reference Case Table 12.  
Available at  http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/pdf/aeotab_12.pdf (last accessed Feb. 2, 2008). 
71 The agency defines the maximum lifetime of vehicles as the highest age at which more than 2 percent of those 
originally produced during a model year remain in service.  In the case of light-duty trucks, for example, this age has 
typically been 36 years for recent model years. 
  
V-78  
In conducting the preliminary uncertainty analysis of benefits and costs from alternative CAFE 
standards required by OMB, NHTSA also considered higher and lower forecasts of future fuel 
prices.  The results of the sensitivity runs can be found in the PRIA.  EIA includes “High Price 
Case” and “Low Price Case” in AEO analyses that reflect uncertainties regarding future levels of 
oil production, but those cases are not meant to be probabilistic, and simply illustrate the range of 
uncertainty that exists.  Because AEO 2008 Early Release included only a Reference Case of 
forecast of fuel prices and did not include the High and Low Price cases, the agency estimated 
high and low fuel prices corresponding to the AEO 2008 Reference Case forecast by assuming 
that high and low price forecasts would bear the same relationship to the Reference Case forecast 
as reported in AEO 2007.72  These alternative scenarios project retail gasoline prices that range 
from a low of $1.94 per gallon to a high of $3.26 per gallon during 2020, and from $2.03 to 
$3.70 per gallon during 2030.  In conjunction with our assumption that fuel taxes will remain 
constant in real or inflation-adjusted terms over this period, these forecasts imply social values of 
saving fuel ranging from $1.47 to $2.79 per gallon during 2020, and from $1.56 to $3.23 per 
gallon in 2030.  
 
EIA is widely-recognized as an impartial and authoritative source of analysis and forecasts of 
U.S. energy production, consumption, and prices.  The agency has published annual forecasts of 
energy prices and consumption levels for the U.S. economy since 1982 in its Annual Energy 
Outlook (AEO), and these forecasts have been widely relied upon by federal agencies for use in 
regulatory analysis and for other purposes.  Since 1994, EIA’s annual forecasts have been based 
upon the agency’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), which includes detailed 
representation of supply pathways, sources of demand, and their interaction to determine prices 
for different forms of energy.   
 
From 1982 through 1993, EIA’s forecasts of world oil prices – the primary determinant of prices 
for gasoline, diesel, and other transportation fuels derived from petroleum – consistently 
overestimated actual prices during future years, often very significantly.  Of the total of 119 
forecasts of future world oil prices for the years 1985 through 2005 that EIA reported in its 1982-
1993 editions of AEO, 109 overestimated the subsequent actual values for those years, on 
average exceeding their corresponding actual values by 75%.  
 
Since that time, however, EIA’s forecasts of future world oil prices show a more mixed record 
for accuracy.  The 1994-2005 editions of AEO reported 91 separate forecasts of world oil prices 
for the years 1995-2005, of which 33 have subsequently proven too high while the remaining 58 
have underestimated actual prices.  The average absolute error (i.e., regardless of its direction) of 
these forecasts has been 21%, but over- and underestimates have tended to offset one another, so 
that on average EIA’s more recent forecasts have underestimated actual world oil prices by 7%.  
Although both its overestimates and underestimates of future world oil prices for recent years 
have often been large, the most recent editions of AEO have significantly underestimated 
petroleum prices during those years for which actual prices are now available.

Outlook 2007 Low Price Case, Table 12, http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/pdf/aeolptab_12.pdf (last accessed Feb. 2, 
2008). 
  
V-79  
However, NHTSA does not regard EIA’s recent tendency to underestimate future prices for 
petroleum and refined products or the high level of current fuel prices as adequate justification to 
employ forecasts that differ from the Reference Case forecast presented in EIA’s Annual Energy 
Outlook 2008 Revised Early Release.  This is particularly the case because this forecast has been 
revised upward significantly since the initial release of AEO 2008, which in turn represented a 
major upward revision from EIA’s fuel price forecast reported previously in AEO 2007.  
NHTSA also notes that retail gasoline prices across the U.S. have averaged $2.94 per gallon 
(expressed in 2005 dollars) for the first three months of 2008, slightly below EIA’s recently 
revised forecast that gasoline prices will average $2.98 per gallon (also in 2005 dollars) 
throughout 2008.  
 
Comparing different forecasts of world oil prices also shows that EIA’s Reference Case forecast 
reported in Annual Energy Outlook 2007 (AEO 2007) was actually the highest of all six 
publicly-available forecasts of world oil prices over the 2010-30 time horizon.73  Because world 
petroleum prices are the primary determinant of retail prices for refined petroleum products such 
as transportation fuels, this suggests that the Reference Case forecast of U.S. fuel prices reported 
in AEO 2007 is likely to be the highest of those projected by major forecasting services.  Further, 
as indicated above, EIA’s most recent fuel price forecasts have been revised significantly upward 
from those previously projected in AEO 2007.   
 
e. Consumer valuation of fuel economy and payback period 
 
In estimating the value of fuel economy improvements that would result from alternative CAFE 
standards to potential vehicle buyers, NHTSA assumes that buyers value the resulting fuel 
savings over only part of the expected lifetime of the vehicles they purchase.  Specifically, we 
assume that buyers value fuel savings over the first five years of a new vehicle’s lifetime, and 
that buyers behave as if they do not discount the value of these future fuel savings.  The five-year 
figure represents the current average term of consumer loans to finance the purchase of new 
vehicles.  We recognize that the period over which individual buyers finance new vehicle 
purchases may not correspond to the time horizons they apply in valuing fuel savings from 
higher fuel economy.  However, NHTSA believes that five years represents a reasonable 
estimate of the average period over which buyers who finance their purchases of new vehicle 
receive – and thus must recognize – the monetary value of future fuel savings resulting from 
higher fuel economy. 
 
The value of fuel savings over the first five years of a vehicle model’s lifetime that would result 
under each alternative fuel economy standard is calculated using the projections of retail fuel 
prices described above.  It is then deducted from the technology costs incurred by its 
manufacturer to produce the improvement in that model’s fuel economy estimated for each 
alternative standard, to determine the increase in the “effective price” to buyers of that vehicle 
model.  The Volpe model uses these estimates of effective costs for increasing the fuel economy 
of each vehicle model to identify the order in which manufacturers would be likely to select 
models for the application of fuel economy-improving technologies in order to comply with 
stricter standards.  The average value of the resulting increase in effective cost from each

manufacturer’s simulated compliance strategy is also used to estimate the impact of alternative 
standards on its total sales for future model years.  
 
However, it is important to recognize that NHTSA estimates the aggregate value to the U.S. 
economy of fuel savings resulting from alternative standards – or their “social” value – over the 
entire expected lifetimes of vehicles manufactured under those standards, rather than over this 
shorter “payback period” we assume for their buyers.  This is discussed directly below in section 
f on “Vehicle survival and use assumptions.”  As indicated previously, the maximum vehicle 
lifetimes used to analyze the effects of alternative fuel economy standards are estimated to be 25 
years for automobiles and 36 years for light trucks.   
 
f. Vehicle survival and use assumptions 
 
NHTSA’s preliminary analysis of fuel/CO2 emissions savings and related benefits from adopting 
alternative standards for MY 2011-2015 passenger cars and light trucks is based on estimates of 
the resulting changes in fuel use over their entire lifetimes in the U.S. vehicle fleet.  The first step 
in estimating lifetime fuel consumption by vehicles produced during a model year is to calculate 
the number that is expected to remain in service during each future year after they are produced 
and sold.74  This number is calculated by multiplying the number of vehicles originally produced 
during a model year by the proportion expected to remain in service at the age they will have 
reached during each subsequent year, often referred to as a “survival rate.”   
 
The agency relies on projections of the number of passenger cars and light trucks that will be 
produced during future years reported by the EIA in its AEO Reference Case forecast.75  It uses 
updated values of age-specific survival rates for cars and light trucks estimated from yearly 
registration data for vehicles produced during recent model years, to ensure that forecasts of the 
number of vehicles in use reflect recent increases in the durability and expected life spans of cars 
and light trucks.76  
 
The next step in estimating fuel use is to calculate the total number of miles that the cars and 
light trucks produced in each model year affected by the proposed CAFE standards will be 
driven during each year of their lifetimes.  To estimate total miles driven, the number of cars and 
light trucks projected to remain in use during each future year (calculated as described above) is 
                                                 
74 Vehicles are defined to be of age 1 during the calendar year corresponding to the model year in which they are 
produced; thus for example, model year 2000 vehicles are considered to be of age 1 during calendar year 2000, age 
1 during calendar year 2001, and to reach their maximum age of 26 years during calendar year 2025.  NHTSA 
considers the maximum lifetime of vehicles to be the age after which less than 2% of the vehicles originally 
produced during a model year remain in service.  Applying these conventions to vehicle registration data indicates 
that passenger cars have a maximum age of 26 years, while light trucks have a maximum lifetime of 36 years.  See

multiplied by the average number of miles they are expected to be driven at the age they will 
have reached in that year.  The agency estimated the average number of miles driven annually by 
cars and light trucks of each age using data from the Federal Highway Administration’s 2001 
National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS).77   
 
Finally, fuel consumption during each year of a model year’s lifetime is estimated by dividing 
the total number of miles its surviving vehicles are driven by the fuel economy they are expected 
to achieve under each alternative CAFE standard.  Each model year’s total lifetime fuel 
consumption is the sum of fuel use by the cars or light trucks produced during that model year 
that are projected to remain in use during each year of their maximum life spans.  In turn, the 
savings in a model year’s lifetime fuel use that will result from each alternative CAFE standard 
is the difference between its lifetime fuel use at the fuel economy level it attains under the 
Baseline alternative, and its lifetime fuel use at the higher fuel economy level it is projected to 
achieve under that alternative standard.  
 
To illustrate these calculations, the most recent edition of the AEO projections that 8.52 million 
light trucks will be produced during 2012, and the agency’s updated survival rates show that 
slightly more than half of these – 50.1 percent, or 4.27 million – are projected to remain in 
service during the year 2027, when they will have reached an age of 14 years.  At that age, light 
trucks achieving the fuel economy level required under the Baseline alternative are driven an 
average of about 10,400 miles, so model year 2012 light trucks will be driven a total of 44.4 
billion miles (= 4.27 million surviving vehicles x 10,400 miles per vehicle) during 2027.   
Summing the results of similar calculations for each year of their 36-year maximum lifetime, 
model year 2012 light trucks will be driven a total of 1,502 billion miles under the Baseline 
alternative.  Under that alternative, they are projected to achieve a test fuel economy level of 
23.8 mpg, which corresponds to actual on-road fuel economy of 19.0 mpg (= 23.8 mpg x 80%).  
Thus their lifetime fuel use under the Baseline alternative is projected to be 79.0 billion gallons 
(= 1,502 billion miles divided by 19.0 miles per gallon).   
 
g. Growth in total vehicle use 
 
By assuming that the annual number of miles driven by cars and light trucks at any age will 
remain constant over the future, NHTSA’s procedure for estimating the number of miles driven 
by cars and light trucks over their lifetimes in effect assumes that all future growth in total 
vehicle-miles driven stems from increases in the number of vehicles in service, rather than from 
increases in the average number of miles they are driven each year.  Similarly, because the 
survival rates used to estimate the number of cars and light trucks remaining in service to various 
ages are assumed to remain fixed for future model years, growth in the total number of cars and 
light trucks in use is effectively assumed to result only from increasing sales of new vehicles.  In 
order to determine the validity of these assumptions, the agency conducted a detailed analysis of 
the causes of recent growth in car and light truck use.   
 
From 1985 through 2005, the total number of miles driven (usually referred to as vehicle-miles 
traveled, or VMT) by passenger cars increased 35 percent, equivalent to a compound annual 
                                                 
77  For a description of the Survey, see http://nhts.ornl.gov/quickStart.shtml (last accessed Dec. 3, 2007). 
  
V-82  
growth rate of 1.5 percent.78  During that time, the total number of passenger cars registered for 
in the U.S. grew by about 0.3 percent annually, almost exclusively as a result of increasing sales 
of new cars.79  Thus growth in the average number of miles automobiles are driven each year 
accounted for the remaining 1.2 percent (= 1.5% - 0.3%) annual growth in total automobile use.80   
 
Over this same period, total VMT by light trucks increased much faster, growing at an annual 
rate of 5.1 percent.  In contrast to the causes of growth in automobile use, however, nearly all 
growth in light truck use over these two decades was attributable to rapid increases in the number 
of light trucks in use.81  In turn, growth in the size of the nation’s light truck fleet has resulted 
almost exclusively from rising sales of new light trucks, since the fraction of new light trucks 
remaining in service to various ages has remained stable or even declined slightly over the past 
two decades.82   
 
On the basis of this analysis, the agency tentatively concludes that its projections of future 
growth in light truck VMT account fully for the primary cause of its recent growth, which has 
been the rapid increase in sales of new light trucks during recent model years.  However, the 
assumption that average annual use of passenger cars will remain fixed over the future appears to 
ignore an important source of recent growth in their total use, the gradual increase in the average 
number of miles they are driven.  To the extent that this factor continues to represent a 
significant source of growth in future passenger car use, the agency’s analysis is likely to 
underestimate the reductions in fuel use and related environmental impacts resulting from stricter 
CAFE standards for passenger cars.83  The agency plans to account explicitly for potential future 
growth in average annual use of both cars and light trucks in the analysis accompanying its Final 
Rule establishing CAFE standards for model years 2011-15.  
 
h. Accounting for the rebound effect of higher fuel economy 
 
                                                 
78 Calculated from data reported in FHWA, Highway Statistics, Summary to 1995, Table vm201at 
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/summary95/vm201a.xlw, and annual editions 1996-2005, Table VM-1 at 
http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/ohpi/hss/hsspubs.htm (last accessed Feb. 2, 2008). 
79 A slight increase in the fraction of new passenger cars remaining in service beyond age 10 has accounted for a 
small share of growth in the U.S. automobile fleet.  The fraction of new automobiles remaining in service to various 
ages was computed from R.L. Polk vehicle registration data for 1977 through 2005 by the agency’s Center for 
Statistical Analysis.   
80 See supra note [2 above here] 
81 FHWA data show that growth in total miles driven by “Two-axle, four-tire trucks,” a category that includes most 
or all light trucks used as passenger vehicles, averaged 5.1% annually from 1985 through 2005.  However, the 
number of miles light trucks are driven each year averaged 11,114 during 2005, almost unchanged from the average 
figure of 11,016 miles during 1985.  Id. 
82 Unpublished analysis of R.L. Polk vehicle registration data conducted by NHTSA Center for Statistical Analysis, 
2005. 
83 Assuming that average annual miles driven per automobile will continue to increase over the future would 
increase the agency’s estimates of total lifetime mileage for MY 2011-18 passenger cars.  Their estimated lifetime 
fuel use would also increase under each alternative standard considered in this analysis, but in inverse relation to 
their fuel economy.  Thus lifetime fuel use will increase by more under the No Increase alternative than under any of 
the alternatives that would increase passenger car CAFE standards, and by progressively less for the alternatives that 
impose stricter standards.  Taking account of this factor would thus increase the agency’s estimates of fuel savings 
for those alternatives, and omitting it will cause the agency’s analysis to underestimate those fuel savings. 
  
V-83  
The rebound effect refers to the tendency for owners to increase the number of miles they drive a 
vehicle in response to an increase in its fuel economy, as would result from more stringent fuel 
economy standards.  The rebound effect occurs because an increase in a vehicle’s fuel economy 
reduces its owner’s fuel cost for driving each mile, which is typically the largest single 
component of the cost of operating a vehicle.  Even with the vehicle’s higher fuel economy, this 
additional driving uses some fuel, so the rebound effect will reduce the net fuel savings that 
result when the fuel economy standards require manufacturers to increase fuel economy.  The 
rebound effect is usually expressed as the percentage by which annual vehicle use increases 
when average fuel cost per mile driven decreases in response to a change in the marginal cost of 
driving an extra mile, due either an increase in fuel economy or a reduction in the price of fuel.  
 
The magnitude of the rebound effect is one of the determinants of the actual fuel savings that are 
likely to result from adopting stricter standards, and thus an important parameter affecting 
NHTSA’s evaluation of alternative standards for future model years.  The rebound effect can be 
measured directly by estimating the elasticity of vehicle use with respect to fuel economy itself, 
or indirectly by the elasticity of vehicle use with respect to fuel cost per mile driven.84  When 
expressed as a positive percentage, either of these parameters gives the fraction of fuel savings 
that would otherwise result from adopting stricter standards, but is offset by the increase in fuel 
consumption that results when vehicles with increased fuel economy are driven more.  
 
Research on the magnitude of the rebound effect in light-duty vehicle use dates to the early 
1980s, and almost unanimously concludes that a statistically significant rebound effect occurs 
when vehicle fuel efficiency improves.85  The most common approach to estimating its 
magnitude has been to analyze statistically household survey data on vehicle use, fuel 
consumption, fuel prices (often obtained from external sources), and other determinants of 
household travel demand to isolate the response of vehicle use to higher fuel economy.  Other 
studies have relied on econometric analysis of annual U.S. data on vehicle use, fuel economy, 
fuel prices, and other variables to identify the response of total or average vehicle use to changes 
in fleet-wide average fuel economy and its effect of fuel cost per mile driven.  Two recent studies 
analyzed yearly variation in vehicle ownership and use, fuel prices, and fuel economy among 
individual states over an extended time period in order to measure the response of vehicle use to 
changing fuel economy.86  
 
An important distinction among studies of the rebound effect is whether they assume that the 
effect is constant, or varies over time in response to the absolute levels of fuel costs, personal 
income, or household vehicle ownership.  Most studies using aggregate annual data for the U.S. 
assume a constant rebound effect, although some of these studies test whether the effect can vary 
as changes in retail fuel prices or average fuel economy alter fuel cost per mile driven.  Many 
                                                 
84 Fuel cost per mile is equal to the price of fuel in dollars per gallon divided by fuel economy in miles per gallon, so 
this figure declines when a vehicle’s fuel economy increases. 
85 Some studies estimate that the long-run rebound effect is significantly larger than the immediate response to 
increased fuel efficiency.  Although their estimates of the adjustment period required for the rebound effect to reach 
its long-run magnitude vary, this long-run effect is most appropriate for evaluating the fuel savings and emissions 
reductions resulting from stricter standards that would apply to future model years.  
86 In effect, these studies treat U.S. states as a data “panel” by applying appropriate estimation procedures to data 
consisting of each year’s average values of these variables for the separate states.  
  
V-84  
studies using household survey data estimate significantly different rebound effects for 
households owning varying numbers of vehicles, although they arrive at differing conclusions 
about whether the rebound effect is larger among households that own more vehicles.  One 
recent study using state-level data concludes that the rebound effect varies directly in response to 
changes in personal income and the degree of urbanization of U.S. cities, as well as fuel costs.   
 
In order to arrive at a preliminary estimate of the rebound effect for use in assessing the fuel 
savings, emissions reductions, and other impacts of alternative standards, NHTSA reviewed 22 
studies of the rebound effect conducted from 1983 through 2005.  We then conducted a detailed 
analysis of the 66 separate estimates of the long-run rebound effect reported in these studies, 
which is summarized in the table below.87  As the table indicates, these 66 estimates of the long-
run rebound effect range from as low as 7 percent to as high as 75 percent, with a mean value of 
23 percent.   
 
Limiting the sample to 50 estimates reported in the 17 published studies of the rebound effect 
yields the same range but a slightly higher mean (24 percent), while focusing on the authors’ 
preferred estimates from published studies narrows this range and lowers its average only 
slightly.  The median estimate of the rebound effect in all three samples, which is generally 
regarded as a more reliable indicator of their central tendency than the average because it is less 
influenced by unusually small and large estimates, is 22 percent.  As Table V-10 indicates, 
approximately two-thirds of all estimates reviewed, of all published estimates, and of authors’ 
preferred estimates fall in the range of 10-30 percent.

87 In some cases, NHTSA derived estimates of the overall rebound effect from more detailed results reported in the 
studies.   For example, where studies estimated different rebound effects for households owning different numbers 
of vehicles but did not report an overall value, we computed a weighted average of the reported values using the 
distribution of households among vehicle ownership categories.  
  
V-85  
The type of data used and authors’ assumption about whether the rebound effect varies over time 
have important effects on its estimated magnitude.  The 34 estimates derived from analysis of 
U.S. annual time-series data produce a median estimate of 14 percent for the long-run rebound 
effect, while the median of 23 estimates based on household survey data is more than twice as 
large (31 percent), and the median of 9 estimates based on pooled state data matches that of the 
entire sample (22 percent).  The 37 estimates assuming a constant rebound effect produce a 
median of 20 percent, while the 29 originally reported estimates of a variable rebound effect 
have a slightly higher median value (23 percent). 
 
In selecting a single value for the rebound effect to use in analyzing alternative standards for 
future model years, NHTSA tentatively attaches greater significance to studies that allow the 
rebound effect to vary in response to changes in the various factors that have been found to affect 
its magnitude.  However, it is also important to update authors’ originally-reported estimates of 
variable rebound effects to reflect current conditions.  Recalculating the 29 original estimates of 
variable rebound effects to reflect current (2006) values for retail fuel prices, average fuel 
economy, personal income, and household vehicle ownership reduces their median estimate to 
16 percent.88  NHTSA also tentatively attaches greater significance to the recent study by Small 
and Van Dender (2005), which finds that the rebound effect tends to decline as average fuel 
economy, personal income, and suburbanization of U.S. cities increase, but – in accordance with 
previous studies – rises with increasing fuel prices.89 
 
Considering the empirical evidence on the rebound effect as a whole, but according greater 
importance to the updated estimates from studies allowing the rebound effect to vary – 
particularly the Small and Van Dender study – NHTSA has selected a rebound effect of 15 
percent to evaluate the fuel savings and other effects of alternative standards for the time period 
covered by this rulemaking.  However, we do not believe that evidence of the rebound effect’s 
dependence on fuel prices or household income is sufficiently convincing to justify allowing its 
future value to vary in response to forecast changes in these variables.  A range extending from 
10 percent to at least 20 percent -- and perhaps as high as 25 percent -- appears to be appropriate 
                                                 
88 As an illustration, Small and Van Dender (2005) allow the rebound effect to vary over time in response to 
changes in real per capita income as well as average fuel cost per mile driven.  While their estimate for the entire 
interval (1966-2001) they analyze is 22 percent, updating this estimate using 2006 values of these variables reduces 
the rebound effect to approximately 10 percent.  Similarly, updating Greene’s 1992 original estimate of a 15 percent 
rebound effect to reflect 2006 fuel prices and average fuel economy reduces it to 6 percent.  See David L. Greene, 
“Vehicle Use and Fuel Economy:  How Big is the Rebound Effect?” The Energy Journal, 13:1 (1992), 117-143.  In 
contrast, the distribution of households among vehicle ownership categories in the data samples used by Hensher et 
al. (1990) and Greene et al. (1999) are nearly identical to the most recent estimates for the U.S., so updating their 
original estimates to current U.S. conditions changes them very little.  See David A. Hensher, Frank W. Milthorpe, 
and Nariida C. Smith, “The Demand for Vehicle Use in the Urban Household Sector: Theory and Empirical 
Evidence,” Journal of Transport Economics and Policy, 24:2 (1990), 119-137; and David L. Greene, James R. Kahn, 
and Robert C. Gibson, “Fuel Economy Rebound Effect for Household Vehicles,” The Energy Journal, 20:3 (1999), 
1-21. 
89 In the most recent light truck CAFE rulemaking, NHTSA chose not to preference the Small and Van Dender study 
over other published estimates of the value of the rebound effect, stating that since it “remains an unpublished 
working paper that has not been subjected to formal peer review, …the agency does not yet consider the estimates it 
provides to have the same credibility as the published and widely-cited estimates it relied upon.”  See 71 FR 17633 
(Apr. 6, 2006).  The study has subsequently been published and peer-reviewed, so NHTSA is now prepared to 
“consider it in developing its own estimate of the rebound effect for use in subsequent CAFE rulemakings.”

for the required analysis of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.  While the agency 
selected 15 percent, it also ran sensitivity analyses at 10 and 20 percent. The results are shown in 
the uncertainties analysis. 
 
i. Benefits from increased vehicle use 
 
The increase in vehicle use from the rebound effect provides additional benefits to their owners, 
who may make more frequent trips or travel farther to reach more desirable destinations.  This 
additional travel provides benefits to drivers and their passengers by improving their access to 
social and economic opportunities away from home.  As evidenced by their decisions to make 
more frequent or longer trips when improved fuel economy reduces their costs for driving, the 
benefits from this additional travel exceed the costs drivers and passengers incur in making more 
frequent or longer trips.   
 
The amount by which the benefits from this additional travel exceed its costs (for fuel and other 
operating expenses) measures the net benefits that drivers receive from the additional travel, 
usually referred to as increased consumer surplus.  NHTSA’s analysis estimates the economic 
value of the increased consumer surplus provided by added driving using the conventional 
approximation, which is one half of the product of the decline in vehicle operating costs per 
vehicle-mile and the resulting increase in the annual number of miles driven.  The magnitude of 
these benefits represents a small fraction of the total benefits from the alternative fuel economy 
standards considered. 
 
j. Added costs from congestion, crashes and noise 
 
Although it provides some benefits to drivers, increased vehicle use associated with the rebound 
effect also contributes to increased traffic congestion, motor vehicle accidents, and highway 
noise.  Depending on how the additional travel is distributed over the day and on where it takes 
place, additional vehicle use can contribute to traffic congestion and delays by increasing traffic 
volumes on facilities that are already heavily traveled during peak periods.  These added delays 
impose higher costs on drivers and other vehicle occupants in the form of increased travel time 
and operating expenses.  Because drivers do not take these added costs into account in deciding 
when and where to travel, they must be accounted for separately as a cost of the added driving 
associated with the rebound effect. 
 
Increased vehicle use due to the rebound effect may also increase the costs associated with traffic 
accidents.  Drivers may take account of the potential costs they (and their passengers) face from 
the possibility of being involved in an accident when they decide to make additional trips.  
However, they probably do not consider all of the potential costs they impose on occupants of 
other vehicles and on pedestrians when accidents occur, so any increase in these “external” 
accident costs must be considered as another cost of additional rebound-effect driving.  Like 
increased delay costs, any increase in these external accident costs caused by added driving is 
likely to depend on the traffic conditions under which it takes place, since accidents are more 
frequent in heavier traffic (although their severity may be reduced by the slower speeds at which 
heavier traffic typically moves). 
 
  
V-87  
Finally, added vehicle use from the rebound effect may also increase traffic noise.  Noise 
generated by vehicles causes inconvenience, irritation, and potentially even discomfort to 
occupants of other vehicles, to pedestrians and other bystanders, and to residents or occupants of 
surrounding property.  Because these effects are unlikely to be taken into account by the drivers 
whose vehicles contribute to traffic noise, they represent additional externalities associated with 
motor vehicle use.  Although there is considerable uncertainty in measuring their value, any 
increase in the economic costs of traffic noise resulting from added vehicle use must be included 
together with other increased external costs from the rebound effect. 
 
NHTSA relies on estimates of congestion, accident, and noise costs caused by automobiles and 
light trucks developed by the Federal Highway Administration to estimate the increased external 
costs caused by added driving due to the rebound effect.90  These estimates are intended to 
measure the increases in costs from added congestion, property damages and injuries in traffic 
accidents, and noise levels caused by automobiles and light trucks that are borne by persons 
other than their drivers (or “marginal” external costs).  Updated to 2006 dollars, FHWA’s 
“Middle” estimates for marginal congestion, accident, and noise costs caused by automobile use 
amount to 5.2 cents, 2.3 cents, and 0.1 cents per vehicle-mile (for a total of 7.6 cents per mile), 
while those for pickup trucks and vans are 4.7 cents, 2.5 cents, and 0.1 cents per vehicle-mile 
(for a total of 7.3 cents per mile).91, 92  These costs are multiplied by the annual increases in 
automobile and light truck use from the rebound effect to yield the estimated increases in 
congestion, accident, and noise externality costs during each future year.   
 
k. Petroleum consumption and import externalities 
 
U.S. consumption and imports of petroleum products also impose costs on the domestic 
economy that are not reflected in the market price for crude petroleum, or in the prices paid by 
consumers of petroleum products such as gasoline.  In economics literature on this subject, these 
costs include (1) higher prices for petroleum products resulting from the effect of U.S. oil import 
demand on the world oil price; (2) the risk of disruptions to the U.S. economy caused by sudden 
reductions in the supply of imported oil to the U.S.; and (3) expenses for maintaining a U.S. 
military presence to secure imported oil supplies from unstable regions, and for maintaining the 
strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) to cushion against resulting price increases.93  Higher U.S. 
imports of crude oil or refined petroleum products increase the magnitude of these external 
                                                 
90 These estimates were developed by FHWA for use in its 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study; see

92  The Federal Highway Administration’s estimates of these costs agree closely with some other recent estimates.  
For example, recent published research conducted by Resources for the Future (RFF) estimates marginal congestion 
and external accident costs for increased light-duty vehicle use in the U.S. to be 3.5 and 3.0 cents per vehicle-mile in 
year-2002 dollars.  See Ian W.H. Parry and Kenneth A. Small, “Does Britain or the U.S. Have the Right Gasoline

economic costs, thus increasing the true economic cost of supplying transportation fuels above 
the resource costs of producing them.  Conversely, reducing U.S. imports of crude petroleum or 
refined fuels or reducing fuel consumption can reduce these external costs.  Any reduction in 
their total value that results from improved light truck fuel economy represents an economic 
benefit of setting more stringent CAFE standards in addition to the value of fuel savings and 
emissions reductions itself.   
 
Increased U.S. oil imports can impose higher costs on all purchasers of petroleum products, 
because the U.S. is a sufficiently large purchaser of foreign oil supplies that changes in U.S. 
demand can affect the world price.  The effect of U.S. petroleum imports on world oil prices is 
determined by the degree of OPEC monopoly power over global oil supplies, and the degree of 
monopsony power over world oil demand exerted by the U.S.  The combination of these two 
factors means that increases in domestic demand for petroleum products that are met through 
higher oil imports can cause the price of oil in the world market to rise, which imposes economic 
costs on all other purchasers in the global petroleum market in excess of the higher prices paid 
by U.S. consumers.94  Conversely, reducing U.S. oil imports can lower the world petroleum 
price, and thus generate benefits to other oil purchasers by reducing these “monopsony costs.”   
 
Although the degree of current OPEC monopoly power is subject to debate, the consensus 
appears to be that OPEC remains able to exercise some degree of control over the response of 
world oil supplies to variation in world oil prices, so that the world oil market does not behave 
completely competitively.95    The extent of U.S. monopsony power is determined by a complex 
set of factors including the relative importance of U.S. imports in the world oil market, and the 
sensitivity of petroleum supply and demand to its world price among other participants in the 
international oil market.  Most evidence appears to suggest that variation in U.S. demand for 
imported petroleum continues to exert some influence on world oil prices, although this 
influence appears to be limited.96   
 
The second component of external economic costs imposed by U.S. petroleum imports arises 
partly because an increase in oil prices triggered by a disruption in the supply of imported oil 
reduces the level of output that the U.S. economy can produce.  The reduction in potential U.S. 
economic output depends on the extent and duration of the increases in petroleum product prices 
that result from a disruption in the supply of imported oil, as well as on whether and how rapidly 
these prices return to pre-disruption levels.  Even if prices for imported oil return completely to 
their original levels, however, economic output will be at least temporarily reduced from the 
level that would have been possible without a disruption in oil supplies.  
                                                 
94 For example, if the U.S. imports 10 million barrels of petroleum per day at a world oil price of $20 per barrel, its 
total daily import bill is $200 million.  If increasing imports to 11 million barrels per day causes the world oil price 
to rise to $21 per barrel, the daily U.S. import bill rises to $231 million.  The resulting increase of $31 million per 
day ($231 million minus $200 million) is attributable to increasing daily imports by only 1 million barrels.  This 
means that the incremental cost of importing each additional barrel is $31, or $10 more than the newly-increased 
world price of $21 per barrel.  This additional $10 per barrel represents a cost imposed on all other purchasers in the 
global petroleum market by U.S. buyers, in excess of the price they pay to obtain those additional imports.

Because supply disruptions and resulting price increases tend to occur suddenly rather than 
gradually, they can also impose costs on businesses and households for adjusting their use of 
petroleum products more rapidly than if the same price increase had occurred gradually over 
time.  These adjustments impose costs because they temporarily reduce economic output even 
below the level that would ultimately be reached once the U.S. economy completely adapted to 
higher petroleum prices.  The additional costs to businesses and households reflect their inability 
to adjust prices, output levels, and their use of energy and other resources quickly and smoothly 
in response to rapid changes in prices for petroleum products. 
 
Since future disruptions in foreign oil supplies are an uncertain prospect, each of these disruption 
costs must be adjusted by the probability that the supply of imported oil to the U.S. will actually 
be disrupted.  The “expected value” of these costs – the product of the probability that an oil 
import disruption will occur and the costs of reduced economic output and abrupt adjustment to 
sharply higher petroleum prices – is the appropriate measure of their magnitude.  Any reduction 
in these expected disruption costs resulting from a measure that lowers U.S. oil imports 
represents an additional economic benefit beyond the direct value of savings from reduced 
purchases of petroleum products. 
 
While the vulnerability of the U.S. economy to oil price shocks is widely thought to depend on 
total petroleum consumption rather than on the level of oil imports, variation in imports is still 
likely to have some effect on the magnitude of price increases resulting from a disruption of 
import supply.  In addition, changing the quantity of petroleum imported into the U.S. may also 
affect the probability that such a disruption will occur.  If either the size of the likely price 
increase or the probability that U.S. oil supplies will be disrupted is affected by oil imports, the 
expected value of the costs from a supply disruption will also depend on the level of imports. 
 
Businesses and households use a variety of market mechanisms, including oil futures markets, 
energy conservation measures, and technologies that permit rapid fuel switching to “insure” 
against higher petroleum prices and reduce their costs for adjusting to sudden price increases.  
While the availability of these market mechanisms has likely reduced the potential costs of 
disruptions to the supply of imported oil, consumers of petroleum products are unlikely to take 
account of costs they impose on others, so these costs are probably not reflected in the price of 
imported oil.  Thus changes in oil import levels probably continue to affect the expected cost to 
the U.S. economy from potential oil supply disruptions, although this component of oil import 
costs is likely to be significantly smaller than estimated by studies conducted in the wake of the 
oil supply disruptions during the 1970s. 
 
The third component of the external economic costs of importing oil into the U.S. includes 
government outlays for maintaining a military presence to secure the supply of oil imports from 
potentially unstable regions of the world and to protect against their interruption.  Some analysts 
also include outlays for maintaining the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which is 
intended to cushion the U.S. economy against the consequences of disruption in the supply of 
imported oil, as additional costs of protecting the U.S. economy from oil supply disruptions. 
 
  
V-90  
NHTSA believes that while costs for U.S. military security may vary over time in response to 
long-term changes in the actual level of oil imports into the U.S., these costs are unlikely to 
decline in response to any reduction in U.S. oil imports resulting from raising future CAFE 
standards for passenger cars and light trucks.  U.S. military activities in regions that represent 
vital sources of oil imports also serve a broader range of security and foreign policy objectives 
than simply protecting oil supplies, and as a consequence are unlikely to vary significantly in 
response to changes in the level of oil imports prompted by higher standards. 
 
Similarly, while the optimal size of the SPR from the standpoint of its potential influence on 
domestic oil prices during a supply disruption may be related to the level of U.S. oil consumption 
and imports, its actual size has not appeared to vary in response to recent changes in oil imports.  
Thus while the budgetary costs for maintaining the Reserve are similar to other external costs in 
that they are not likely to be reflected in the market price for imported oil, these costs do not 
appear to have varied in response to changes in oil import levels. 
 
In analyzing benefits from its recent actions to increase light truck CAFE standards for model 
years 2005-07 and 2008-11, NHTSA relied on a 1997 study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
(ORNL) to estimate the value of reduced economic externalities from petroleum consumption 
and imports.97  More recently, ORNL updated its estimates of the value of these externalities, 
using the analytic framework developed in its original 1997 study in conjunction with recent 
estimates of the variables and parameters that determine their value.98  These include world oil 
prices, current and anticipated future levels of OPEC petroleum production, U.S. oil import 
levels, the estimated responsiveness of oil supplies and demands to prices in different regions of 
the world, and the likelihood of oil supply disruptions.  ORNL prepared its updated estimates of 
oil import externalities for use by EPA in evaluating the benefits of reductions in U.S. oil 
consumption and imports expected to result from its Renewable Fuel Standard Rule of 2007 
(RFS).99  
 
The updated ORNL study was subjected to a detailed peer review by experts selected by EPA, 
and its estimates of the value of oil import externalities were subsequently revised to reflect their 
comments and recommendations.100  Specifically, reviewers recommended that ORNL increase 
its estimates of the sensitivity of oil supply by non-OPEC producers and oil demand by nations 
other than the U.S. to changes in the world oil price, as well as reduce its estimate of the 
sensitivity of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to potential sudden increases in world oil 
prices.  
 
After making the revisions recommended by peer reviewers, ORNL’s updated estimates of the 
monopsony cost associated with U.S. oil imports range from $5.22 to $9.68 per barrel, with a

most likely estimate of $7.41 per barrel.  These estimates imply that each gallon of fuel saved as 
a result of adopting higher CAFE standards will reduce the monopsony costs of U.S. oil imports 
by $0.124 to $0.230 per gallon, with the actual value most likely to be $0.176 per gallon saved.  
ORNL’s updated and revised estimates of the increase in the expected costs associated with oil 
supply disruptions to the U.S. and the resulting rapid increase in prices for petroleum products 
amount to $4.54 to $5.84 per barrel, although its most likely estimate of $4.59 per barrel is very 
close to the lower end of this range.  According to these estimates, each gallon of fuel saved will 
reduce the expected costs disruptions to the U.S. economy by $0.108 to $0.139, with the actual 
value most likely to be $0.109 per gallon.  
 
The updated and revised ORNL estimates suggest that the combined reduction in monopsony 
costs and expected costs to the U.S. economy from oil supply disruptions resulting from lower 
fuel consumption total $0.232 to $0.370 per gallon, with a most likely estimate of $0.286 per 
gallon.  This represents the additional economic benefit likely to result from each gallon of fuel 
saved by higher CAFE standards, beyond the savings in resource costs for producing and 
distributing each gallon of fuel saved.  NHTSA employs this midpoint estimate in its analysis of 
the benefits from fuel savings projected to result from alternative CAFE standards for model 
years 2011-15.  It also analyzes the effect on these benefits estimates from variation in this value 
over the range from $0.232 to $0.370 per gallon of fuel saved. 
 
NHTSA’s analysis of benefits from alternative CAFE standards does not include cost savings 
from either reduced outlays for U.S. military operations or maintaining a smaller SPR among the 
external benefits of reducing gasoline consumption and petroleum imports by means of 
tightening future standards.  This view concurs with that of both the original ORNL study of 
economic costs from U.S. oil imports and its recent update, which conclude that savings in 
government outlays for these purposes are unlikely to result form reductions in consumption of 
petroleum products and oil imports on the scale of those likely to result from the alternative 
increases in CAFE standards considered for model years 2011-15. 
l. Air pollutant emissions 
 
 (i)  Impacts on criteria air pollutant emissions 
 
This section explains how NHTSA has monetized and modeled air pollutant emissions of criteria 
pollutants and CO2 in developing the proposed standards using the EPCA factors.  However, this 
section does not contain NHTSA’s assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the 
proposed standards and reasonable alternatives for purposes of the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321-4347.  On March 28, 2008, NHTSA published a notice of 
intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) and opened the NEPA scoping 
process (73 FR 16615).  NHTSA will consider the potential environmental impacts of the 
proposed standards and reasonable alternatives, including impacts associated with CO2 emissions 
and climate change, through the NEPA process.  NHTSA’s NEPA analysis will inform any 
further action on the proposed standards, consistent with NEPA and EPCA. 
 
While reductions in domestic fuel refining and distribution that result from lower fuel 
consumption will reduce U.S. emissions of criteria pollutants, additional vehicle use associated 
with the rebound effect from higher fuel economy will increase emissions of these pollutants.  
  
V-92  
Thus the net effect of stricter CAFE standards on emissions of each criteria pollutant depends on 
the relative magnitudes of its reduced emissions in fuel refining and distribution, and increases in 
its emissions from vehicle use.  Because the relationship between emission rates (emissions per 
gallon refined of fuel or mile driven) in fuel refining and vehicle use is different for each criteria 
pollutant, the net effect of fuel savings from the proposed standards on total emissions of each 
pollutant is likely to differ.  Criteria air pollutants emitted by vehicles and during fuel production 
include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon compounds (usually referred to as “volatile organic 
compounds,” or VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and sulfur oxides 
(SOx).   
 
The increase in emissions of these pollutants from additional vehicle use due to the rebound 
effect is estimated by multiplying the increase in total miles driven by vehicles of each model 
year and age by age-specific emission rates per vehicle-mile for each pollutant.  NHTSA 
developed these emission rates using EPA’s MOBILE6.2 motor vehicle emissions factor 
model.101   Emissions of these pollutants also occur during crude oil extraction and transportation, 
fuel refining, and fuel storage and distribution.  The reduction in total emissions from each of 
these sources thus depends on the extent to which fuel savings result in lower imports of refined 
fuel, or in reduced domestic fuel refining.  To a lesser extent, they also depend on whether any 
reduction in domestic gasoline refining is translated into reduced imports of crude oil or reduced 
domestic extraction of petroleum.  
 
Based on analysis of changes in U.S. gasoline imports and domestic gasoline consumption 
forecast in AEO’s 2008 Early Release, NHTSA tentatively estimates that 50 percent of fuel 
savings resulting from higher CAFE standards will result in reduced imports of refined gasoline, 
while the remaining 50 percent will reduce domestic fuel refining.102  The reduction in domestic 
refining is assumed to leave its sources of crude petroleum unchanged from the mix of 90 
percent imports and 10 percent domestic production projected by AEO. 
 
NHTSA proposes to estimate reductions in criteria pollutant emissions from gasoline refining 
and distribution using emission rates obtained from Argonne National Laboratories’ Greenhouse 
Gases and Regulated Emissions in Transportation (GREET) model.103  The GREET model 
provides separate estimates of air pollutant emissions that occur in four phases of fuel production 
and distribution: crude oil extraction, crude oil transportation and storage, fuel refining, and fuel 
distribution and storage.104   We tentatively assume that reductions in imports of refined fuel 
                                                 
101 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, MOBILE6 Vehicle Emission Modeling Software, available at 
http://www.epa.gov/otaq/m6.htm#m60 (last accessed Sept. 10, 2007). 
102 Estimates of the response of gasoline imports and domestic refining to fuel savings from stricter standards are 
variable and highly uncertain, but our preliminary analysis indicates that under any reasonable assumption about 
these responses, the magnitude of the net change in criteria pollutant emissions (accounting for both the rebound 
effect and changes in refining emissions) is extremely low relative to their current total. 
103 Argonne National Laboratories, The Greenhouse Gas and Regulated Emissions from Transportation (GREET) 
Model, Version 1.8, June 2007, available at http://www.transportation.anl.gov/software/GREET/index.html (last 
accessed Sept. 10, 2007). 
104 Emissions that occur during vehicle refueling at retail gasoline stations (primarily evaporative emissions of 
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) are already accounted for in the “tailpipe” emission factors used to estimate 
the emissions generated by increased light truck use.  GREET estimates emissions in each phase of gasoline 
production and distribution in mass per unit of gasoline energy content; these factors are then converted to mass per 
gallon of gasoline using the average energy content of gasoline. 
  
V-93  
would reduce criteria pollutant emissions during fuel storage and distribution only.  Reductions 
in domestic fuel refining using imported crude oil as a feedstock are tentatively assumed to 
reduce emissions during crude oil transportation and storage, as well as during gasoline refining, 
distribution, and storage, because less of each of these activities would be occurring.  Similarly, 
reduced domestic fuel refining using domestically-produced crude oil is tentatively assumed to 
reduce emissions during all phases of gasoline production and distribution.105 
 
The net changes in emissions of each criteria pollutant are calculated by adding the increases in 
their emissions that result from increased vehicle use and the reductions that result from lower 
domestic fuel refining and distribution.  The net change in emissions of each criteria pollutant is 
converted to an economic value using estimates of the economic costs per ton emitted (which 
result primarily from damages to human health) developed by EPA and submitted to the federal 
Office of Management and Budget for review.  For certain criteria pollutants, EPA estimates 
different per-ton costs for emissions from vehicle use than for emissions of the same pollutant 
during fuel production,  reflecting differences in their typical geographic distributions, 
contributions to ambient pollution levels, and resulting population exposure. 
 
(ii) Reductions in CO2 emissions  
 
Fuel savings from stricter CAFE standards also result in lower emissions of carbon dioxide 
(CO2), the main greenhouse gas emitted as a result of refining, distribution, and use of 
transportation fuels.106  Lower fuel consumption reduces carbon dioxide emissions directly, 
because the primary source of transportation-related CO2 emissions is fuel combustion in internal 
combustion engines.  NHTSA tentatively estimates reductions in carbon dioxide emissions 
resulting from fuel savings by assuming that the entire carbon content of gasoline, diesel, and 
other fuels is converted to carbon dioxide during the combustion process.107 
 
Reduced fuel consumption also reduces carbon dioxide emissions that result from the use of 
carbon-based energy sources during fuel production and distribution.108  NHTSA currently 
                                                 
105 In effect, this assumes that the distances crude oil travels to U.S. refineries are approximately the same regardless 
of whether it travels from domestic oilfields or import terminals, and that the distances that gasoline travels from 
refineries to retail stations are approximately the same as those from import terminals to gasoline stations.   
106 Carbon dioxide emissions account for more than 97 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions from the refining 
and use of transportation fuels; see U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Draft Inventory of GHG Emissions and 
Sinks (1990-1999), Tables ES-1 and ES-4.  Available at 
http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/publications/emissions/us2001/energy.pdf (last accessed Sept. 10, 2007). 
107 This assumption results in a slight overestimate of carbon dioxide emissions, since a small fraction of the carbon 
content of gasoline is emitted in the forms of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons.  However, the 
magnitude of this overestimate is likely to be extremely small.  This approach is consistent with the recommendation 
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for “Tier 1” national greenhouse gas emissions inventories.  Cf. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 2, 
Energy, p. 3.16. 
108 We note that NHTSA did not, for purposes of this proposed rulemaking, attempt to estimate changes in emissions 
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) other than carbon dioxide.  This was because carbon dioxide itself accounts for more 
than 95 percent of the total CO2-equivalent emissions of fuel production and use, even with other GHGs that result 
from those activities (principally methane and nitrous oxide) weighted by their higher global warming potentials 
(GWPs) relative to CO2.  Calculated from U.S. EPA, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 1990-
2005, EPA430-R-07-02, April 15, 2007.  Available at

V-94  
estimates the reductions in CO2 emissions during each phase of fuel production and distribution 
using carbon dioxide emission rates obtained from the GREET model, using the previous 
assumptions about how fuel savings are reflected in reductions in each phase.  The total 
reduction in CO2 emissions from the improvement in fuel economy under each alternative CAFE 
standard is the sum of the reductions in emissions from reduced fuel use and from lower fuel 
production and distribution. 
 
iii) Economic value of reductions in CO2 emissions 
 
NHTSA has taken the economic benefits of reducing CO2 emission into account in this 
rulemaking, both in developing proposed CAFE standards and in assessing the economic 
benefits of each alternative that was considered.  As noted above, the 9th Circuit found in CBD 
that NHTSA had been arbitrary and capricious in deciding not to monetize the benefit of 
reducing CO2 emissions, saying that the agency had not substantiated the conclusion in its April 
2006 final rule that the appropriate course was not to monetize (i.e., quantify the value of) carbon 
emissions reduction at all.   
 
To this end, NHTSA reviewed published estimates of the “social cost of carbon emissions” 
(SCC).  The SCC refers to the marginal cost of additional damages caused by the increase in 
expected climate impacts resulting from the emission of each additional metric ton of carbon, 
which is emitted in the form of CO2.109  It is typically estimated as the net present value of the 
impact over some time period (100 years or longer) of one additional ton of carbon emitted into 
the atmosphere.  Because accumulated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and 
the projected impacts on global climate are increasing over time, the economic damages resulting 
from each additional ton of CO2 emissions in future years are believed to be greater as a result.  
Thus estimates of the SCC are typically reported for a specific year, and these estimates are 
generally larger for emissions in more distant future years.   
 
There is substantial variation among different authors’ estimates of the SCC, much of which can 
be traced to differences in their underlying assumptions about several variables.  These include 
the sensitivity of global temperatures and other climate attributes to increasing atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, discount rates applied to future economic damages from 
climate change, whether damages sustained by developing regions of the globe should be 
weighted more heavily than damages to developed nations, how long climate changes persist 
once they occur, and the economic valuation of specific climate impacts.110   
 
Taken as a whole, recent estimates of the SCC may underestimate the true damage costs of 
carbon emissions because they often exclude damages caused by extreme weather events or 
                                                 
109 Carbon itself accounts for 12/44, or about 27%, of the mass of carbon dioxide (12/44 is the ratio of the molecular 
weight of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Thus each ton of carbon emitted is associated with 44/12, or 3.67, tons 
of carbon dioxide emissions.  Estimates of the SCC are typically reported in dollars per ton of carbon, and must be 
divided by 3.67 to determine their equivalent value per ton of carbon dioxide emissions.

V-95  
climate response scenarios with low probabilities but potentially extreme impacts, and may 
underestimate the climate impacts and damages that could result from multiple stresses on the 
global climatic system.  At the same time, however, many studies fail to consider potentially 
beneficial impacts of climate change, and do not adequately account for how future development 
patterns and adaptations could reduce potential impacts from climate change or the economic 
damages they cause. 
 
Given the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the SCC, the use of any single study may not be 
advisable since its estimate of the SCC will depend on many assumptions made by its authors.  
The Working Group II’s contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report of the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)111 notes that:  
The large ranges of SCC are due in the large part to differences in assumptions 
regarding climate sensitivity, response lags, the treatment of risk and equity, 
economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic 
losses, and discount rates. 
 Although the IPCC does not recommend a single estimate of the SCC, it does cite the Tol 
(2005) study on four separate occasions (pages 17, 65, 813, 822) as the only available survey of 
the peer-reviewed literature that has itself been subjected to peer review.  Tol developed a 
probability function using the SCC estimates of the peer reviewed literature and found estimates 
ranging from less than zero to over $200 per metric ton of carbon.  In an effort to resolve some 
of the uncertainty in reported estimates of climate damage costs from carbon emissions, Tol 
(2005) reviewed and summarized one hundred and three estimates of the SCC from 28 published 
studies.  He  concluded that when only peer-reviewed studies published in recognized journals 
are considered, “…climate change impacts may be very uncertain but is unlikely that the 
marginal damage costs of carbon dioxide emissions exceed $50 per [metric] ton carbon [about 
$14 per metric ton of CO2].” 112  He also concluded that the costs may be less than $14.   
 
Because of the number of assumptions required by each study, the wide range of uncertainty 
surrounding these assumptions, and their critical influence on the resulting estimates of climate 
damage costs, some studies have undoubtedly produced estimates of the SCC that are 
unrealistically high, while others are likely to have estimated values that are improbably low.  
Using a value for the SCC that reflects the central tendency of estimates drawn from many 
studies reduces the chances of relying on a single estimate that subsequently proves to be biased.  
 
It is important to note that estimates of the SCC almost invariably include the value of worldwide 
damages from potential climate impacts caused by carbon dioxide emissions, and are not 
confined to damages likely to be suffered within the U.S.  In contrast, the other estimates of costs 
and benefits of increasing fuel economy included in this proposal include only the economic 
values of impacts that occur within the U.S.  For example, the economic value of reducing 
criteria air pollutant emissions from overseas oil refineries is not counted as a benefit resulting

from this rule, because any reduction in damages to health and property caused by overseas 
emissions are unlikely to be experienced within the U.S. 
 
In contrast, the reduced value of transfer payments from U.S. oil purchasers to foreign oil 
suppliers that results when lower U.S. oil demand reduces the world price of petroleum (the 
reduced “monopsony effect”)  is counted as a benefit of reducing fuel use.113   If the agency’s 
analysis was conducted from a worldwide rather than a U.S. perspective, however, the benefit 
from reducing air pollution overseas would be included, while reduced payments from U.S. oil 
consumers to foreign suppliers would not.   
 
In order to be consistent with NHTSA’s use of exclusively domestic costs and benefits in prior 
CAFE rulemakings, the appropriate value to be placed on changes climate damages caused by 
carbon emissions should be one that reflects the change in damages to the United States alone.  
Accordingly, NHTSA notes that the value for the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions might be 
restricted to the fraction of those benefits that are likely to be experienced within the United 
States.   
 
Although no estimates of benefits to the U.S. itself that are likely to result from reducing CO2 
emissions are currently available, NHTSA expects that if such values were developed, the 
agency would employ those rather than global benefit estimates in its analysis.  NHTSA also 
anticipates that if such values were developed, they would be lower than comparable global 
values, since the U.S. is likely to sustain only a fraction of total global damages resulting from 
climate change.  
         
In the meantime, the agency has elected to use the IPCC estimate of $43 per metric ton of carbon 
as an upper bound on the benefits resulting from reducing each metric ton of U.S. emissions. 114  
This corresponds to approximately $12 per metric ton of CO2 when expressed in 2006 dollars.  
This estimate is based on the 2005 Tol study.115  The Tol study is cited repeatedly as an 
authoritative survey in various IPCC reports, which are widely accepted as representing the 
general consensus in the scientific community on climate change science.  Since the IPCC 
estimate includes the worldwide costs of potential damages from carbon dioxide emissions, 
NHTSA has elected to employ it as an upper bound on the estimated value of the reduction in 
U.S. domestic damage costs that is likely to result from lower CO2 emissions.116   
 
                                                 
113  The reduction in payments from U.S. oil purchasers to domestic petroleum producers is not included as a benefit, 
since it represents a transfer that occurs entirely within the U.S. economy. 
114  The estimate of $43 per ton of carbon emissions is reported by Tol (p. 2070) as the mean of the “best” estimates 
reported in peer-reviewed studies (see fn. 4).  It thus differs from the mean of all estimates reported in the peer-
reviewed studies surveyed by Tol.  The $43 per ton value is also attributed to Tol by IPCC Working Group II 
(2007), p. 822. 
115  Tol’s more recent (2007) and inclusive survey has been published online with peer-review comments.  The 
agency has elected not to rely on the estimates it reports, but will consider doing so in its analysis of the final rule if 
the survey has been published, and will also consider any other newly-published evidence.  
116  For purposes of comparison, we note that in the rulemaking to establish CAFE standards for MY 2008-11 light 
trucks, NRDC recommended a value of $10 to $25 per ton of CO2 emissions reduced by fuel savings and both 
Environmental Defense and Union of Concerned Scientists recommended a value of $50 per ton of carbon 
(equivalent to about $14 per ton of CO2 emissions).  
  
V-97  
The IPCC Working Group II Fourth Assessment Report (2007, p. 822) further suggests that the 
SCC of carbon is growing at an annual 2.4 percent growth rate, based on estimated increases in 
damages from future emissions reported in published studies.  NHTSA has also elected to apply 
this growth rate to Tol’s original 2005 estimate.  Thus by 2011, the agency estimates that the 
upper bound on the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions will have reached about $14 per metric 
ton of CO2, and will continue increase by 2.4 percent annually thereafter.   
 
In setting a lower bound, the agency agrees with the IPCC Working Group II (2007) report that 
“significant warming across the globe and the locations of significant observed changes in many 
systems consistent with warming is very unlikely to be due solely to natural variability of 
temperatures or natural variability of the systems” (pp. 9).  Although this finding suggests that 
the global value of economic benefits from reducing carbon dioxide emissions is unlikely to be 
zero, it does not necessarily rule out low or zero values for the benefit to the U.S. itself from 
reducing emissions.  
 
For most of the analysis it performed to develop this proposal, NHTSA required a single estimate 
for the value of reducing CO2 emissions.  The agency thus elected to use the midpoint of the 
range from $0 to $14 (or $7.00) per metric ton of CO2 as the initial value for the year 2011, and 
assumed that this value would grow at 2.4 percent annually thereafter.  This estimate is 
employed for the analyses conducted using the Volpe CAFE model to support development of 
the proposed standards.  The agency also conducted sensitivity analyses of the benefits from 
reducing CO2 emissions using both the upper ($14 per metric ton) and lower ($0 per metric ton) 
bounds of this range.   
 
NHTSA seeks comment on its tentative conclusions for the value of the SCC, the use of a 
domestic versus global value for the economic benefit of reducing CO2 emissions, the rate at 
which the value of the SCC grows over time, the desirability of and procedures for incorporating 
benefits from reducing emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2, and any other aspects of 
developing a reliable SCC value for purposes of establishing CAFE standards. 
 
m. The value of increased driving range 
 
Improving vehicles’ fuel economy may also increase their driving range before they require 
refueling.  By reducing the frequency with which drivers typically refuel their vehicles, and by 
extending the upper limit of the range they can travel before requiring refueling, improving fuel 
economy thus provides some additional benefits to their owners.  (Alternatively, if manufacturers 
respond to improved fuel economy by reducing the size of fuel tanks to maintain a constant 
driving range, the resulting cost saving will presumably be reflected in lower vehicle sales 
prices.) 
 
No direct estimates of the value of extended vehicle range are readily available, so NHTSA’s 
analysis calculates the reduction in the annual number of required refueling cycles that results 
from improved fuel economy, and applies DOT-recommended values of travel time savings to 
convert the resulting time savings to their economic value.117  As an illustration of how the value 
                                                 
117 See Department of Transportation, Guidance Memorandum, “The Value of Saving Travel Time:  Departmental 
Guidance for Conducting Economic Evaluations,” Apr. 9, 1997.  Available at 
  
V-98  
of extended refueling range is estimated, a typical small light truck model has an average fuel 
tank size of approximately 20 gallons.  Assuming that drivers typically refuel when their tanks 
are 20 percent full (i.e., 4 gallons in reserve), increasing this model’s actual on-road fuel 
economy from 24 to 25 mpg would extend its driving range from 384 miles (= 16 gallons x 24 
mpg) to 400 miles (= 16 gallons x 25 mpg).  Assuming that it is driven 12,000 miles/year, this 
reduces the number of times it needs to be refueled each year from 31.3 (= 12,000 miles per year 
/ 384 miles per refueling) to 30.0 (= 12,000 miles per year / 400 miles per refueling), or by 1.3 
refuelings per year.   
 
Weighted by the nationwide mix of urban (about 2/3) and rural (about 1/3) driving and average 
vehicle occupancy for all driving trips (1.6 persons), the DOT-recommended value of travel time 
per vehicle-hour is $24.00 (in 2006 dollars).118  Assuming that locating a station and filling up 
requires ten minutes, the annual value of time saved as a result of less frequent refueling amounts 
to $5.20 (calculated as 10/60 x 1.3 x $24.00).  This calculation is repeated for each future 
calendar year that vehicles of each model year affected by the alternative CAFE standards 
proposed in this rule would remain in service.  Like fuel savings and other benefits, however, the 
value of this benefit declines over a model year’s lifetime, because a smaller number of vehicles 
originally produced during that model year remain in service each year, and those remaining in 
service are driven fewer miles.  
n. Discounting future benefits and costs 
 
Discounting future fuel savings and other benefits is intended to account for the reduction in 
their value to society when they are deferred until some future date rather than received 
immediately.  The discount rate expresses the percent decline in the value of these benefits – as 
viewed from today’s perspective – for each year they are deferred into the future.  NHTSA uses a 
rate of 7 percent per year to discount the value of future fuel savings and other benefits to 
analyze the potential impacts of alternative CAFE standards.  However, the agency also performs 
an alternative analysis of benefits from alternative increases in CAFE standards using a 3 percent 
discount rate, and seeks comment on whether the standards should be set using a 3 percent rate 
instead of a 7 percent rate.  
 
There are several reasons that NHTSA relies primarily on 7 percent as the appropriate rate for 
discounting future benefits from increased CAFE standards.  First, OMB Circular A-4 indicates 
that this rate reflects the economy-wide opportunity cost of capital.119  It also states that this “is 
the appropriate discount rate whenever the main effect of a regulation is to displace or alter the 
use of capital in the private sector.”120  We believe that a substantial portion of the cost of this

118  The hourly wage rate during 2006 is estimated to be $24.00.  Personal travel (94.4 percent of urban travel) is 
valued at 50 percent of the hourly wage rate. Business travel (5.6 percent or urban travel) is valued at 100 percent of 
the hourly wage rate.  For intercity travel, personal travel (87 percent) is valued at 70 percent of the wage rate, while 
business travel (13 percent) is valued at 100 percent of the wage rate.  The resulting values of travel time are $12.67 
for urban travel and $17.66 for intercity travel, and must be multiplied by vehicle occupancy (1.6) to obtain the 
estimate value of time per vehicle hour.

regulation may come at the expense of other investments the auto manufacturers might otherwise 
make.  Several large manufacturers are resource-constrained with respect to their engineering 
and product-development capabilities.  As a result, other uses of these resources will be foregone 
while they are required to be applied to technologies that improve fuel economy. 
 
Second, 7 percent also appears to be an appropriate rate to the extent that the costs of the 
regulation come at the expense of consumption as opposed to investment.  NHTSA believes that 
financing rates on vehicle loans represent an appropriate discount rate, because they reflect the 
opportunity costs faced by consumers when buying vehicles with greater fuel economy and a 
higher purchase price.  Most new and used vehicle purchases are financed, and because most of 
the benefits from higher fuel economy standards accrue to vehicle purchasers in the form of fuel 
savings, the appropriate discount rate is the interest rate buyers pay on loans to finance their 
vehicle purchases.121   
 
According to the Federal Reserve, the interest rate on new car loans made through commercial 
banks has closely tracked the rate on 10-year treasury notes, but exceeded it by about 3 
percent.122   The official Administration forecast is that real (or inflation-adjusted) interest rates 
on 10-year treasury notes will average about 3 percent through 2016, implying that 6 percent is a 
reasonable forecast for the real interest rate on new car loans.123  In turn, the interest rate on used 
car loans made through automobile financing companies has closely tracked the rate on new car 
loans made through commercial banks, but exceeded it by about 3 percent.124  (We consider rates 
on loans that finance used car purchases, because some of the fuel savings resulting from 
improved fuel economy accrue to used car buyers.)  Given the 6 percent estimate for new car 
loans, a reasonable forecast for used car loans is thus 9 percent.   
 
Because the benefits of fuel economy accrue to both new and used car owners, a discount rate 
between 6 percent and 9 percent is thus appropriate for evaluating future benefits resulting from 
more stringent fuel economy standards.  Assuming that new car buyers discount fuel savings at 6 
percent for 5 years (the average duration of a new car loan) 125 and that used car buyers discount 
fuel savings at 9 percent for 5 years (the average duration of a used car loan),126 the single 
constant discount rate that yields equivalent present value fuel savings is very close to 7 percent. 
                                                 
121 Some empirical evidence also demonstrates that used car purchasers are willing to pay higher prices for greater 
fuel economy; see, e.g., James A. Kahn, “Gasoline Price Expectations and the Used Automobile Market: A Rational 
Expectations Asset Price Approach,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 101 (May 1986), 323-339.

However, NHTSA also seeks comment on whether a discount rate of 3 percent would be more 
appropriate for this proposed rulemaking.  OMB Circular A-4 also states that when regulation 
primarily and directly affects private consumption (e.g., through higher consumer prices for 
goods and services), instead of primarily affecting the allocation of capital, a lower discount rate 
may be appropriate.  The alternative discount rate that is most appropriate in this case is the 
social rate of time preference, which refers to the rate at which society discounts future 
consumption to determine its value at the present time.  The rate that savers are willing to accept 
to defer consumption into the future when there is no risk that borrowers will fail to pay them 
back offers one possible measure of the social rate of time preference.  As noted above, the real 
rate of return on long-term government debt, which has averaged around 3 percent over the last 
30 years, provides a reasonable estimate of this value. 
 
In the context of CAFE standards for motor vehicles, the appropriate discount rate depends on 
one’s view of how the costs and benefits of more stringent standards are distributed between 
vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Given that the discount rate plays a big role in the level of 
the standards under a “social optimization” context,    NHTSA conducted an analysis of what the 
standards and associated costs and benefits would be if the future benefits are discounted at 3 
percent.   
 
o. Accounting for uncertainty in benefits and costs 
 
In analyzing the uncertainty surrounding its estimates of benefits and costs from alternative 
CAFE standards, NHTSA has considered alternative estimates of those assumptions and 
parameters likely to have the largest effect.  These include the projected costs of fuel economy-
improving technologies and their expected effectiveness in reducing vehicle fuel consumption, 
forecasts of future fuel prices, the magnitude of the rebound effect, the reduction in external 
economic costs resulting from lower U.S. oil imports, the value to the U.S. economy of reducing 
carbon dioxide emissions, and the discount rate applied to future benefits and costs.  The range 
for each of these variables employed in the uncertainty analysis is presented in the section of this 
notice discussing each variable. 
 
The uncertainty analysis was conducted by assuming independent normal probability 
distributions for each of these variables, using the low and high estimates for each variable as the 
values below which 5 percent and 95 percent of observed values are believed to fall.  Each trial 
of the uncertainty analysis employed a set of values randomly drawn from each of these 
probability distributions, assuming that the value of each variable is independent of the others.  
Benefits and costs of each alternative standard were estimated using each combination of 
variables.  A total of 1,000 trials were used to establish the likely probability distributions of 
estimated benefits and costs for each alternative standard. 
 
 
C.   How has NHTSA used the Volpe model to select the proposed standards? 
 
1. Establishing a continuous function standard 
 
  
V-101  
NHTSA’s analysis supporting determination of the proposed continuous function standard builds 
on the analysis that supported the determination of the standards in NHTSA’s 2006 light truck 
final rule.  That process involved three steps.127 
 
In “phase one,” NHTSA added fuel saving technologies to each manufacturer’s fleet, model by 
model, for a model year until the net benefit from doing so reached its maximum value (i.e., until 
the incremental cost of improving its fuel economy further just equals the incremental value of 
fuel savings and other benefits from doing so).  This was done for each of the seven largest 
manufacturers.  Data points representing each vehicle’s size and “optimized” fuel economy from 
the light truck fleets of those manufacturers were then combined into a single data set. 
 
In “phase two,” a preliminary continuous function was statistically fitted through these data 
points, subject to constraints at the upper and lower ends of the footprint range. 
 
Once a preliminary continuous function was statistically fitted to the data for a model year, 
“phase three” was performed.  In that phase, the level of the function was adjusted to maximize 
net benefits, that is, the preliminary continuous function was raised or lowered until industry-
wide (limited to the seven largest manufacturers) benefits were maximized. 
 
For NHTSA’s 2006 light truck rulemaking, the optimization procedure was applied in its entirety 
only for MY 2011.  The levels of the functions for MYs 2008-2010 were set at levels producing 
incremental costs approximately equivalent to those produced by the alternative Unreformed 
CAFE standards promulgated for those model years in the same rulemaking. 
 
Analysis conducted by NHTSA to prepare for the current proposed rulemaking revealed several 
opportunities to refine the procedure described above before applying it to this action, which 
spans several model years.  The resultant procedure is described below. 
 
2. Calibration of initial continuous function standards 
 
For the optimized standards, the first step in the current procedure involves all three phases 
described above.  Separately, for each of the seven largest manufacturers, the agency determined 
the level of additional technology that would maximize net benefits.  The agency then combined 
the resultant fleets and used standard statistical analysis procedures to specify a continuous 
function (i.e., a function without abrupt changes) with asymptotes128 set at the average fuel 
economy levels of the smallest and largest vehicles in this “optimized” fleet.129 
 
                                                 
127 See 71 FR 17596-97 (Apr. 6, 2006) for a more complete discussion of this process. 
128 Some functions are not bounded.  For example, a line that is not flat will increase in one direction without limit 
and will, in the other direction, decrease without limit.  The continuous function applied by the agency is of a form 
with upper and lower boundaries.  Even as vehicle footprint declines or increases, the function’s value (in mpg or 
grams/mile) will never exceed or fall below a specific value.  These upper and lower limits are called asymptotes. 
129 Consistent with EPCA, the passenger car and light truck fleets were analyzed separately.  For passenger cars, the 
agency determined the asymptotes of the continuous function by calculating the average fuel economy of the 
smallest 8 percent and the largest 5 percent of the fleet.  For light trucks, the agency considered the smallest 11 
percent and the largest 10 percent of the fleet.  These cohorts were determined by identifying gaps in the distribution 
of vehicles according to footprint. 
  
V-102  
In the 2006 Light Truck Rule, NHTSA created an attribute-based fuel economy standard based 
upon a continuous function using a logistic curve. The 2006 rulemaking, and its antecedent 
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, contains an extended discussion of alternative 
approaches, including a bin-based system and different potential curves.130  As discussed below, 
the rulemaking explains NHTSA’s decision to promulgate a standard based on a logistic (“S 
shaped”) curve with constrained asymptotes (upper and lower limits). 
 
Although we did not explicitly recognize it in the MY 2008-2011 light truck rulemaking, 
NHTSA now wishes to note that any continuous function with upper and lower asymptotes, as 
was promulgated in the last rulemaking and is proposed in this rulemaking, in fact has an 
absolute lower limit specified by the lower asymptote, which guards against the risk of upsizing 
to a great degree.  As vehicle footprint continues to increase, decreases in the corresponding 
target become progressively smaller, such that the target approaches but never reaches the value 
of the lower asymptote.  Because the required level of CAFE is the harmonic average of targets 
applicable to a manufacturer’s vehicle models, the value of the standard can approach but will 
never fall to the value of this lower asymptote, no matter how far the manufacturer’s product mix 
shifts toward larger vehicles.  This will prevent loss of fuel savings due to manufacturer 
decisions to upsize their vehicles. 
 
NHTSA has adopted the same approach for this proposed rulemaking.   However, while the 
principles underlying the Agency’s decision in 2006 continue to be compelling, the application 
of the logistic curve approach to passenger cars has persuaded us that it may be appropriate to 
reconsider the choice of the logistic curve for setting a continuous function, at least for passenger 
cars. 
 
NHTSA would prefer to let vehicle data define the shape of the curve used for the continuous 
functions.  However, NHTSA must also weigh certain practical public policy considerations in 
establishing the continuous function, including for regions where vehicles are not currently being 
built in significant numbers, but might become available in the future.  In establishing footprint-
based CAFE standards, the agency’s objective is not to reflect a clear engineering relationship 
between footprint and fuel economy.  Other attributes would be more closely correlated with fuel 
economy.  The agency’s objective is to make CAFE regulations more consistent with public 
policy goals, in particular (1) a rebalancing of requirements such that full-line manufacturers are 
not disproportionately burdened and (2) the establishment of an incentive that discourages 
manufacturers from responding to CAFE standards in ways that could compromise occupant 
protection and highway safety.  While it is helpful that the attribute—in this case footprint—has 
an observed relationship to fuel economy, it is not necessary that this relationship be isolated 
from accompanying relationships (e.g., between weight and fuel economy) that can be better 
related to estimable physical processes.  Similarly, it is more important that the functional form 
for the attribute-based standard yield desirable outcomes than that it have a clear foundation in 
estimable physical processes. 
 
In general, public policy considerations and available vehicle data combine to suggest that the 
fuel economy standard should be generally downward sloping (on a fuel economy basis) with 
respect to NHTSA’s chosen attribute, vehicle footprint.  The arguments that favor an attribute-
                                                 
130 FR   
  
V-103  
based system (maintaining consumer choice, protecting safety, more equitable distribution of 
costs, reducing the cost of regulation) all argue for a downward sloping curve.  Larger vehicles 
should, in principle, have higher drag, weigh more, and therefore have greater inertia than 
otherwise identical smaller vehicles.   Hence, all other factors remaining equal, larger vehicles 
should have lower fuel economy than smaller vehicles.  Therefore, the selection of vehicle 
footprint as the reference attribute should produce downward sloping curves.  Also, the tendency 
of larger vehicles to have lower fuel economy than smaller vehicles should provide some 
disincentive to shift to larger vehicles rather than adding technology; although doing so would 
tend to reduce the required CAFE level, it would also tend to reduce the achieved CAFE level. 
 
However, vehicle data, by itself, does not necessarily define what functional form that the curve 
ought to take.  In the 2006 light truck rulemaking, NHTSA considered a linear, quadratic, 
exponential, unconstrained logistic, and constrained logistic functions as possible alternatives.  
For light trucks, the various approaches produced broadly similar standards through the most 
commonly used vehicle sizes, but drastically different standards at the high and low ends of the 
range. 
 
• Linear functions produced very high fuel economy standards for the smallest 
vehicles, and low standards for the largest vehicles. 
 
• The quadratic function generated a minimum at about 75 square feet, and then 
perversely turned upward for vehicles with larger footprints.  The standard for very 
small vehicles was unreasonably high. 
 
• The exponential and unconstrained logistic functions produced unreasonably high 
standards for small vehicles, but flattened out for larger vehicles. 
 
• The constrained logistic function provided a broadly linear downward-sloping 
through the most commonly used vehicle sizes, along with basically flat standards for 
very large and very small vehicles. 
 
On this basis, NHTSA believed that, while the data did not dictate a particular functional form, 
public policy considerations made the constrained logistic function particularly attractive.  The 
considerations include: 
 
• A relatively flat standard for larger vehicles acts as a de facto ‘backstop’ for the 
standard in the event that future market conditions encourage manufacturers to build 
very large vehicles.  Nothing prevents manufacturers from building larger vehicles.  
With a logistic curve, however, vehicles upsizing beyond some limit face a flat 
standard that is increasingly difficult to meet. 
 
• A constrained logistic curve doesn’t impose unachievable fuel economy standards on 
vehicles that have unusually small footprints, thus continuing to keep manufacturing 
fuel-efficient small vehicles available as a compliance option. 
 
  
V-104  
• Infeasible sections of the curve can have may be unimportant for the industry at large 
while having a particular adverse impact on manufacturers that specialize in very 
large or small vehicles, for example, two-seater sports car. 
 
• The transition from the ‘flat’ portions of the curve to the ‘slope’ portions of the curve 
is smooth and gradual, reducing the incentive for manufacturers to achieve 
compliance through marginal changes in vehicle size. 
 
• The inflection points are set by the data and can potentially vary from year to year, 
rather than being chosen by NHTSA. 
 
On the other hand, a constrained logistic curve shares with other functional forms a risk of an 
excessively steep or excessively flat slope.   The slope of the compliance curve may be 
considered as ‘too steep’ for public policy purposes when manufacturers can achieve appreciable 
reductions in compliance costs by marginally increasing the size of a vehicle’s footprint—e.g., 
the cost of compliance from upsizing is lower than other cost-effective compliance methods open 
to manufacturers. 
 
A slope is ‘too flat’ for public policy purposes when it negates the advantages of an attribute-
based system:  where the standard doesn’t meaningfully vary with respect to changes in the 
underlying attribute, it cannot be said to be an attribute-based system within the meaning of the 
statute. 
 
NHTSA chose footprint as the best attribute for an attribute-based standard in part because we 
believed changing a vehicle’s footprint would involve significant costs for manufacturers, 
probably requiring a redesign of the vehicle. 
 
While “too steep” or “too flat” inevitably cannot be defined with precision, they need to be kept 
in mind. 
 
For the proposed standards, the agency defined the continuous function using the following 
formula: 
( )
( )
1
1 1 1
1
x c d
x c d
T
e
a b a e
−
−
= ⎛ ⎞+ −⎜ ⎟ +⎝ ⎠
 
where  
 T = the fuel economy target (in mpg) 
a =  the maximum fuel economy target (in mpg) 
 b =  the minimum fuel economy target (in mpg) 
  
V-105  
c =  the footprint value (in square feet) at which the fuel economy target is midway 
between a and b131 
d =  the parameter (in square feet) defining the rate at which the value of targets 
decline from the largest to smallest values 
e =   2.718132 
x =  footprint (in square feet, rounded to the nearest tenth) of the vehicle model 
 
 
As for analysis of the light truck rule promulgated in 2006, NHTSA constrained this function by 
determining the maximum and minimum targets (a and b) and then holding those targets 
constant while using statistical techniques to fit the other two coefficients (c and d) in this 
equation. 
 
In the current analysis for passenger cars, the upper and lower asymptotes are based on the smallest 
three percent and largest four percent, respectively, of the fleet.  These reflect footprint values defining 
distinct cohorts outside the bulk of the fleet, and correspond to footprint values of less than 39.5 square 
feet (i.e., up to the approximate size of a Honda Fit) and greater than 52.5 square feet (i.e., at least as 
great as the approximate size of a Toyota Avalon), respectively:

For light trucks, the upper asymptote (i.e., the highest mpg value of the continuous function defining 
fuel economy targets) is based on the smallest (in terms of footprint) eleven percent of the fleet, and 
the lower asymptote is based on the largest six percent of the fleet.  These cohorts correspond to 
footprint values of less than 44.5 square feet (i.e., up to the approximate size of a Honda CR-V) and 
greater than 72.5 square feet (i.e., comprised primarily of extended vans and long-bed pickup trucks),

NHTSA invites comment on the identification of vehicle cohorts for purposes of establishing 
upper and lower limits (asymptotes) bounding the attribute-based standard.  After updating its 
baseline market forecast in consideration of new product plan information from manufacturers, 
the agency plans to reevaluate these cohorts for both passenger cars and light trucks before 
promulgating a final rule, and notes that changes in approach could lead to changes in 
stringency. 
 
Given the above asymptotes, fitting the above functional form to the “optimized” passenger car 
fleet resulted in the following initial continuous functions:

For each model year, NHTSA then raised or lowered the resultant continuous function until net 
benefits were maximized for the seven largest manufacturers (in total).  Without subsequent 
recalibrations discussed below, this produced the following continuous functions for passenger 
cars:

In fitting the continuous function, NHTSA considered a range of statistical estimation 
techniques.   In the 2006 light truck rulemaking, NHTSA estimated the parameters of the logistic 
function using fuel consumption (measured in gallons per mile) for each vehicle produced in a 
particular model year, weighted by sales  
 
For this rulemaking, we observed that estimated fuel consumption functions for passenger cars 
were significantly affected by several outliers—a small number of popular vehicles that had 
significantly higher fuel economy than the fleet as a whole and, even more so, than vehicles of 
similar footprint.  For passenger cars, the function, as estimated by weighted ordinary least 
squares, was exceptionally steep within the range considered.  This observation, in turn, led 
NHTSA to consider alternative approaches to statistically fitting the continuous function. 
 
Among the options considered by NHTSA were the following:  dropping the outlying vehicles 
from the estimation process, weighted and unweighted ordinary least squares, and weighted and 
unweighted mean absolute deviation (MAD).  MAD is a statistical procedure that has been 
demonstrated to produce more efficient parameter estimates in the presence of significant 
outliers.133  As examples, the following two charts show the MY2015 passenger car and light 
                                                 
133 In the case of a dataset not drawn from a sample with a Gaussian, or normal, distribution, there is often a need to 
employ robust estimation methods rather than rely on least-squares approach to curve fitting.  The least-squares 
approach has, as an underlying assumption, that the data are drawn from a normal distribution, and hence fits a 
curve using a sum-of-squares method to minimize errors.  This approach will, in a sample drawn from a non-normal 
distribution, give excessive weight to outliers by making their presence felt in proportion to the square of their 
  
V-110  
truck fleets after the application of technologies to each manufacturers’ fleet.  These charts 
reveal numerous outliers for the passenger car fleet and, to a lesser extent, the light truck fleet:

distance from the fitted curve, and, hence, distort the resulting fit.  With outliers in the sample, the typical solution is 
to use a robust method such as a minimum absolute deviation, rather than a squared term, to estimate the fit (see, 
e.g., "AI Access: Your Access to Data Modeling," at 
http://www.aiaccess.net/English/Glossaries/GlosMod/e_gm_O_Pa.htm#Outlier).  The effect on the estimation is to 
let the presence of each observation be felt more uniformly, resulting in a curve more representative of the data (see, 
e.g., Peter Kennedy, A Guide to Econometrics, 3rd edition, 1992, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).

NHTSA requests comment on the best method for statistically fitting the continuous function. 
 
There are strong theoretical arguments for using an unweighted (rather than weighted) analysis.  
Although the purpose of the attribute-based standard is to discourage downsizing and more 
equitably distribute compliance burdens among manufacturers, we expect the associated curve to 
be most successful if it is based on the observed physical relationship between vehicle size (i.e., 
footprint) and fuel economy.  The curve reflects this relationship by depicting the variety of 
vehicle designs that have been produced in the real world for any given footprint.   It is a 
measure of what is possible, not what consumers currently choose to buy. 
 
Consider a scenario in which there are only 2 vehicle designs with exactly the same footprint, 
both from the same manufacturer.  The manufacturer sells 1,000 units of design A and 100 units 
of design B.  Either design could be produced in any number (no vehicle-specific resource 
constraint).  The difference in sales is due to a variety of marketing considerations including 
vehicle styling, price, performance, fuel economy, etc., that have made one vehicle model more 
popular than the other.  To describe the potential fuel economy capability at any given footprint, 
we want to recognize that both vehicles represent equally valid and viable designs.  If we weight 
them according to sales, we will set standards that are biased towards existing fleet profiles 
rather than reflecting design potential. 
 
However, the process by which we select the stringency (as distinct from the form) of the 
standard must consider sales volumes because the standards are based on sales-weighted average 
performance.  Therefore, even if we use unweighted analysis develop the form of the standard, 
  
V-112  
we would continue to evaluate the standard’s stringency (and, therefore, its costs and benefits) 
based on sales-weighted average calculations done on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis. 
  
There is already precedent for using unweighted data to produce curves that are descriptive of 
engineering relationships.  In NHTSA’s Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis for FMVSS 
216 roof crush standards, a series of force-versus-deflection curves were produced for individual 
vehicle models and then averaged together.  In that case, the agency was seeking observed 
relationships that reflect engineering possibilities, rather than a profile of the existing sales fleet. 
 
In terms of relative emphasis on different vehicle models, the distinction between unweighted 
and weighted analysis is profound in the light vehicle market, in part because of the way 
“models” are defined for purposes of CAFE.  The highest-selling passenger car model represents 
356,000 units, and the lowest-selling model represents only 5 units.  As a group, the five lowest-
selling models represent only 305 units.  Thus, weighted analysis places more than 1,000 times 
the emphasis on the highest-selling model than on the five lowest-selling models, and more than 
70,000 times the emphasis than on the single lowest-selling model.  The following histograms 
shows the broader distributions of models and sales with respect to model-level sales (first for 
passenger cars, then for light trucks):

For purposes of setting the stringency of the corporate average fuel economy standard, this is 
vital because enforcement is based on the sales-weighted average.  However, for purposes of 
developing a curve intended to represent fuel economy levels achieved at a given footprint, 
weighted analysis effectively ignores many models. 
 
On the other hand, unweighted estimation is depending on the definition of a “model”.  
Manufacturers will sometimes offer substantially similar vehicles with different badges (i.e., 
Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable) as two different models.  The distinction between differing ‘options 
packages’ on a single model and two distinct models is inevitably a bit blurry.  When estimating 
fuel economy standards using a sales-weighted regression, this distinction is not material, since 
the estimation process will produce substantially the same results independently of the number of 
distribution of those sales into larger or smaller numbers of models.   In unweighted estimation, 
however, dividing a particular vehicle family into a larger number of distinct models give that 
family some extra influence in the analysis.  Nonetheless, considering that such parsing into 
similar “models” produces far less weighting disparity than does sales weighting (as illustrated 
by the 70,000-to-1 ratio mentioned above), NHTSA has tentatively concluded that unweighted 
estimation remains preferable to sales-weighted estimation. 
 
The following charts shows, for MY2015 passenger cars and light trucks, how the use of sales-
weighted least-squares estimation compares to the proposed approach, which uses unweighted 
mean absolute deviation.  For passenger cars, the curve resulting from proposed approach is 
somewhat shallower than the curve resulting from sales-weighted least squares estimation.  For 
light trucks, the curve resulting from proposed approach is somewhat steeper:

NHTSA invites comment on the relative merits of unweighted and weighted estimation, as well 
as on the other curve fitting options (e.g., the use of mean absolute deviation) raised here.   The 
agency plans to reevaluate curve fitting approaches for both passenger cars and light trucks 
before promulgating a final rule, and notes that changes in approach could lead to changes in 
stringency and impacts on different manufacturers.] 
 
3.  Adjustments to address policy considerations 
 
NHTSA believes that the resultant curve characteristics discussed above are empirically correct 
in that they correspond to the footprint and fuel economy values of the fleet obtained by adding 
fuel saving technologies to each manufacturer’s fleet until the net benefit from doing so reached 
its maximum value.   
 
However, there are three issues (described above) which may tend to reduce the effectiveness of 
fuel economy regulation over time.  These concerns are: 
 
• curve crossings; 
• excessive steepness of the passenger car curve; 
• risk of upsizing. 
 
In this rule, NHTSA proposes a solution to the curve crossing issue, requests comment on 
various methods of reducing the steepness of the passenger car, and examines the potential for 
upsizing generally under the provisions of this proposed rule. 
 
a. Curve crossings 
  
V-116  
 
For both passenger cars and light trucks, NHTSA observed some curve crossings from one 
model year to the next (i.e., for the same footprint, some targets fell below the levels attained in 
the previous model year), as revealed in the above charts.  The upper limit of the MY2012 
passenger car curve falls slightly (about 0.1 mpg) below the MY2011 value.  For light trucks, the 
lower asymptote in MY2012 is 0.9 mpg below the lower asymptote in MY2011.  This was not 
observed during the last round of light truck rulemaking because reformed CAFE was fully 
implemented only in MY 2011.  During the transition period (MYs 2008-2010), the standards 
were set at levels equivalent in cost to unreformed CAFE.  However, for this rulemaking, 
because the projected fleet composition changes between model years and the fuel economy 
target function is optimized in every model year, the initial continuous functions do not change 
monotonically (i.e., in only one direction—increasing) from year to year at every footprint value.  
Given the availability of lead time and the importance of improving fuel economy, NHTSA has 
decided that, in the setting of the standards, we should ensure that the fuel economy targets do 
not fall from one year to the next at any footprint value. 
 
To address the year-to-year fluctuations in the functions, which may lead to these curve 
crossings, NHTSA recalibrated each continuous function to prevent it from crossing the 
continuous function from any previous model year.  In doing so, the agency attempted to avoid 
continuous functions that would artificially encourage the product mix to approximate that of 
earlier years.  Instead, the agency recalibrated by gradually shifting the initial continuous 
functions for each model year toward the initial continuous function determined above for the 
product mix for MY 2015.  For both passenger cars and light trucks, the agency adjusted each of 
the four coefficients in the formula determining the continuous function such that regular steps 
were taken year by year between the values determined above for MY 2011 and those for MY 
2015.  For example, the inflection point (the coefficient determining the footprint at which the 
target falls halfway between its minimum and maximum values) defining the light truck target 
function was increased by 0.034 square feet annually from 51.9 square feet in MY 2011 to 52.1 
square feet in MY 2015. 
 
NHTSA also recalibrated the continuous function for each model year by adding, as needed, 
anti-backsliding constraints that prevent the function from either (a) yielding an industry wide 
average level of CAFE lower than that for the preceding model year, (b) for a given footprint, 
having targets that fall below the level of previous year, and (c) having an asymptote lower than 
that of the preceding model year.  The “decision tree” for determining for each model year the 
need for each of these constraints is summarized below in Figure 12.

The industry-wide average CAFE is prevented from decreasing between model years in order to 
prevent standards from falling below the level that was determined to be achievable for the 
model year before.  To allow the industry-wide CAFE level to fall between successive model 
years would be to promulgate a standard that, notwithstanding maximizing net benefits, falls 
below what the agency has determined to be feasible in previous years.  In a model year in which 
simple maximization of net benefits would have caused this to occur, NHTSA shifted the 
resultant curve upward (without changing the curve’s shape) in order to produce an industry-
wide CAFE equal to that of the preceding model year. 
 
  
V-118  
b. Steep curves for passenger cars 
 
NHTSA has developed a set of attribute-based curves for passenger cars for this proposal 
consistent with the methodology used in the 2008-2011 light duty truck rule.  However, unlike 
the relatively gradually sloped curve relating fuel economy to footprint for trucks, our analysis 
for cars when utilizing a constrained logistic curve produces a comparatively steep “S”-shaped 
curve for passenger cars.  This occurs primarily because – unlike trucks – current passenger car 
sales include vehicles with a wide range of fuel economy spanning a relatively narrow footprint 
range.  Consequently, there is a relatively steep curve applied to the middle range of footprint 
values with a more rapid change of slope in the tails to flatten the curve and thus satisfy the 
constrained logistic functional form.   
 
In this Rule, NHTSA is proposing a relatively “steep” curve.  The agency has considered and 
experimented with several methods of reducing the steepness of the passenger car curve.   
However, each of these approaches has created challenges that may potentially be worse than the 
problem they are trying to cure. 
 
However, any attempt to ‘fix’ the steepness of the passenger car curve appears to come at a 
price:  First, flattening the curve by any particular method will move the curve away from the 
actual vehicle data.  Second, flatter curves are generally place greater compliance burdens on 
full-line manufacturers than comparatively stringent (in terms of average require CAFE) 
standards.  This tends to increase the overall costs required to achieve a given amount of fuel 
savings and societal benefits, and it increases the risk that NHTSA would need to return to a 
“least capable manufacturer” approach in order to ensure economic practicability.  Doing so 
would likely reduce stringency, and reduce fuel savings.   In deciding on a particular approach, 
NHTSA must balance the certainty of high costs and lost fuel savings through a less “efficient” 
standard against the risk that the steepness of the curve might stimulate manufacturers to evade 
the standard over time by redesigning their vehicles over time. 
 
In proposing steep curve for this rule, NHTSA has tentatively decided that the cures that we have 
identified come at too high a price is lost stringency or undesirable side effects.  However, 
NHTSA requests comment on these and other potential solutions to reduce the steepness of the 
proposed car curves. 
 
Some of the approaches considered or tested by NHTSA include: 
 
Linear standards.  When the fuel consumption of vehicles with added technologies is plotted 
against footprint, we note a roughly linear relationship over the existing range of footprint 
values.  Hence, a simple alternative to the current constrained logistic function would be to 
estimate a linear form of the curve with the sales data.  However, NHTSA is concerned that such 
an approach may result in very low fuel economy standards for the largest footprint vehicles, 
very high fuel economy standards for the smallest vehicles, and loss of the inherent backstop 
properties of the constrained logistic function. 
 
In addition, the slope of a line estimated through a ‘cloud’ of data may be very sensitive to the 
exact characteristics of vehicles with the largest and smallest footprints.  It may turn out that 
  
V-119  
small changes in vehicle characteristics in the tails could shift the slope of a linear estimate.   
Further, it may be impossible to materially adjust the slope of a linear standard in future years 
without accepting curve crossing.  The following two charts compare linear regression results for 
MY2015 to the curves proposed today by NHTSA.  The result for passenger cars illustrates the 
concern regarding behavior at large and small footprints.  Over the range of footprints in which 
light trucks are expected to be offered in MY2015, the result for light trucks shows less 
difference from the proposed curve.

Constrained linear standards.  Another possible approach would be to retain the flattened tails 
proposed today but reduce the steepness of the middle portion by allowing it to directly reflect a 
linear relationship.  This approach could be likened to a simplification or linearization of the 
constrained logistic function.  The same minima and maxima would be used to bound the vertical 
extent of the linear form.  The following two charts suggest that, at least for the MY2015 
passenger car and light truck fleets considered today, a constrained linear standard would, 
compared to the standard proposed today, likely result in a similar distribution of compliance 
burdens among manufacturers (because the stringency at each footprint would be similar):

However, the agency remains concerned that the slope could exhibit greater year-to-year 
variation than the proposed logistic form (although further analysis would be required in order to 
address this concern).  Also, as discussed in the preamble to the 2006 Federal Register notice 
regarding light truck CAFE standards, the agency remains concerned that the upper and lower 
“kinks” in the function could offer unexpected incentives for manufacturers to redesign vehicles 
with footprints close to the kink-point.   
 
Dual Attribute Approaches.  A third possible solution would be to use additional attribute-
based information to spread out the distribution of passenger cars across the x-axis.  In effect, 
this approach uses a second attribute to normalize the footprint-fuel economy relationship.  This 
second attribute might be horsepower, weight, or horsepower-to-weight. 
 
In analyzing the expected passenger car market, NHTSA observes that the ratio of engine 
horsepower to vehicle weight generally increases with increasing footprint.  Higher power-to-
weight ratios tend to imply lower fuel economy, as the engine is typically larger and operating 
less efficiently under driving conditions applicable to certification.  Thus, the fuel consumption 
versus footprint curves for passenger cars reflect this relationship.  For trucks, there does not 
appear to be a relationship between footprint and the power-to-weight ratio.   For passenger cars, 
then, adjusting fuel consumption values to normalize for differences in power-to-weight ratio 
may produce a flatter curve providing less of an upsizing incentive for middle footprint values.  
 
NHTSA has experimented with normalizing footprint by horsepower-to-weight ratio.  The result 
was a nearly flat standard with respect to footprint across the most popular size ranges.  This did 
not appear to deliver the benefits of an attribute-based system.  In addition, it involves significant 
downward adjustments to the fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles (such as the Toyota 
Prius), for which the engine is not the sole source of motive power.  Also, it involves significant 
upward adjustments to the fuel economy of vehicles with high power-to-weight ratios (such as 
the Chevrolet Corvette).  Some of these upward and downward adjustments are large enough to 
suggest radical changes in the nature of the original vehicles.  Furthermore, insofar as such 
normalization implies that NHTSA should adopt a two-attributed standard (e.g., in which the 
target depends on footprint and power-to-weight ratio), it may be challenging and time 
consuming to come up with a sufficiently precise vehicle-by-vehicle definition of horsepower or 
horsepower-to-weight to be used for regulatory purposes.

Shape Based on Combined Fleet.  A fourth possible solution would be to combine the 
passenger car and light truck fleet to determine the shape of the constrained logistic curve, and 
then determine the stringency (i.e., height) of that curve separately for each fleet.  On one hand, 
this approach would base the curve’s shape on the widest available range of information.  On the 
other, the resultant initial shape for each fleet would be based on vehicles from the other fleet.  
For example, the initial shape applied to passenger cars would be based, in part, on large SUVs 
and pickup trucks, and the initial shape applied to light trucks would be based, in part, on 
subcompact cars.  Stringency would still be determined separately for passenger cars and light 
trucks, NHTSA invites comments on the consistency of this approach with the requirement in 
EPCA to establish separate standards for passenger cars and light trucks. 
 
NHTSA performed a preliminary analysis of this approach.  Considering the very wide range of 
fuel consumption levels in the combined fleet, NHTSA developed the asymptotes based on the 
average fuel consumption of all passenger cars and light trucks, respectively, rather than on the 
smallest passenger cars and the largest light trucks.  The resultant MY2015 curve, shown below, 
is similar in curvature to the proposed curve for passenger cars and notably steeper than the 
proposed curve for light trucks.

Ignoring Outliers.  A fifth possible solution would be to ignore outliers.  Lacking an objective 
means of classifying specific vehicle models as outliers that should be excluded from the 
analysis, NHTSA explored the possibility of excluding all hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).  The 
Japanese government also excluded HEVs for purposes of developing Japan’s light vehicle 
efficiency standards.  However, doing so yield initial curves of shape similar to those proposed, 
but displaced slightly in the direction of lower fuel consumption.  The similarity of the shapes of 
these curves suggests that optimization against the full fleet (with HEVs) would produce 
standards of stringency similar to those proposed today.

NHTSA invites comments on the importance of addressing the relative steepness of the proposed 
curves for passenger cars, and on the feasibility of, technical basis for, and implications of any 
options for doing so.  The agency plans to reevaluate standards for both passenger cars and light 
trucks before promulgating a final rule, and notes that changes in approach—including measures 
to address the steepness of the passenger car curves—could lead to changes in stringency as well 
as different impacts on different manufacturers. 
 
c. Risk of upsizing 
The steepness of the proposed curve for passenger cars presents a localized risk that 
manufacturers will respond in ways that compromise expected fuel savings.  That is, although 
the constrained logistic curve has a steep region, that region does not cover a wide range of 
footprints.  However, any attribute-based system involves the broader risk that manufacturers 
will shift toward vehicles with the lowest fuel economy targets.  As mentioned above, the 
constrained logistic curve proposed by NHTSA provides an absolute floor.  That is, even 
manufacturers discontinue all but the very largest known passenger cars and light trucks, they 
would still be required to meet CAFE standards no lower than the lower asymptote (on an mpg 
basis) of the constrained logistic curve.  Also, for domestic passenger cars, EISA establishes a 
floor or “backstop” equal to 92% of the average required CAFE level for passenger cars.  This 
backstop is discussed below in Section VI. 
 
It is difficult to assess the risk that manufacturers may shift the mix of vehicles enough to 
approach the EISA floor for domestic passenger cars, or to approach the lower asymptotes for 
light trucks or imported passenger cars.  However, considering the footprint distribution of 
vehicles (as indicated by the various histograms and scatter plots shown above in this section) 
  
V-127  
expected to be covered by the proposed rule, NHTSA anticipates that manufacturers would not 
be able to approach these reductions in stringency without dramatically altering product mix.  
The agency doubts that manufacturers could do so unless consumer preferences also shift 
dramatically. 
 
NHTSA also notes that under attribute-based CAFE standards such as the agency is proposing 
today, shifts in consumer preferences could cause manufacturers’ required CAFE levels and, 
therefore, achieved fuel savings (and perhaps costs) to increase.  For example, if changes in fuel 
prices combine with demographic and/or other factors to cause market preferences to shift 
significantly toward vehicles with smaller footprints, manufacturers shifting (relative to current 
estimates) in that direction will face higher required CAFE levels than the agency has estimated. 
 
 
 
C.  Penetration of Technologies by Alternative 
 
Tables V-11a through V-11g show the penetration of technologies by year for passenger cars and 
Tables V-12a through V-12g show the penetration of technologies by year for light trucks for the 
alternatives.  These tables are for the whole fleet combined, not by specific manufacturers.  They allow 
the reader to see the progression of technologies applied as the standards get stricter.  The baseline 
shown here is the adjusted baseline for MY 2011.

VI.   MANUFACTURER SPECIFIC CAFE CAPABILITIES 
 
Table VI-1a for passenger cars and Table VI-2a for light trucks shows the CAFE product plans 
for each of the manufacturers, based on the manufacturer’s plans without taking into account any 
alternative or dual fuel vehicle attributes.    
 
Table VI-1b for passenger cars and Table VI-2b for light trucks shows the ADJUSTED 
BASELINE.  Note that when we do cost and benefit analyses, we use the ADJUSTED 
BASELINE throughout the analysis.  The adjusted baseline assumes for the analysis that each 
manufacturer, below the MY 2010 standard applicable to that manufacturer, (except Ferrari, 
Lotus, Maserati, Mercedes, Porsche and Volkswagen) would apply technology to achieve the 
MY 2010 standard.  Those mpg levels of those manufacturers with product plans above the MY 
2010 standard, or above their required reform level standard in any model year, are retained for 
the adjusted baseline.  Our rationale for this adjustment of the baseline is that the costs and 
benefits of achieving MY 2010 mpg levels for light trucks have already been analyzed and 
estimated in previous analyses.  The methodology in this analysis is to apply technologies to the 
manufacturers’ plans and increase them to the adjusted baseline.  The costs of these technologies 
are estimated, but they are not considered part of this rule.  We then estimate the costs and 
benefits of going from the adjusted baseline to the level of the alternatives.134  
 
The required standard levels for only the proposal are shown in Table VI-1d for passenger cars 
and VI-2d for light trucks.  For the other tables in the group from Tables VI-1c through VI-1j for 
passenger cars and Tables VI-2c through VI-2j for light trucks shows what we believe the 
manufacturers’ fuel economy could be for “meeting” the alternative levels analyzed in this 
analysis.  They include in some cases manufacturers’ plans at levels higher than the alternative 
standards would require.  Note that not all manufacturers are assumed to attempt to “meet” the 
alternatives.  We assume that Ferrari, Lotus, Maserati, Mercedes, Porsche and Volkswagen 
would not meet these levels because, for them, the cost of meeting these levels is more than the 
cost of paying penalties.  These manufacturers have shown, in the past, the willingness to pay 
penalties rather than spend more money to improve the fuel economy of their products.   
 
The agency has performed an analysis of how manufacturers could respond to changes in the 
proposed CAFE levels.  The “Technology Application Analysis” (or the “Volpe Analysis”) uses 
a technology application algorithm to systematically apply consistent cost and performance 
assumptions to the entire industry, as well as consistent assumptions regarding economic 
decision-making by manufacturers.  The resulting computer model (the CAFE Compliance and 
Effects Model), developed by technical staff of the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems 
Center in consultation with NHTSA staff, is used to help estimate the overall economic impact of 
the alternative CAFE standards.  The Volpe analysis shows the economic impact of the standards 
in terms of increases in new vehicle prices on a manufacturer-wide, industry-wide, and average 
per-vehicle basis.  Based on these estimates and corresponding estimates of net economic and 
                                                 
134  Some manufacturer’s plans are above the level of the standard already and are assumed to remain at that level.  
Some manufacturer’s levels go slightly above the proposed mark for them since some technologies are applied to all 
models of a particular manufacturer so that the exact level for each manufacturer may be slightly higher than the 
level of the standard and costs and benefits are estimated to that level.   
  
VI-2
other benefits, the agency is able to consider alternatives that are economically practicable and 
technologically feasible.   
 
We note that the Volpe model has been updated and refined with respect to its representation of 
some fuel-saving technologies, but the model remains fundamentally unchanged.  The model has 
been peer reviewed.  The model documentation, including a description of the input assumptions 
and process, as well as peer review reports, was made available in the rulemaking docket for the 
August 2005 NPRM.135 
 
Our analyses of the potential effects of alternative CAFE standards were founded on two major 
elements:  (1) projections of the technical characteristics and sales volumes of future product 
offerings and (2) estimates of the applicability and incremental cost and fuel savings associated 
with different hardware changes—technologies—that might be utilized in response to alternative 
CAFE standards.

VII.  COST IMPACTS 
 
Technology Costs 
Table V-1 provides the technology cost estimates used in this analysis.  These are meant to 
represent consumer costs for high-volume production of these technologies after sufficient 
experience with their application have resulted in all “learning curve” effects being fully 
realized.  The method taken to get to this consumer cost estimate starts with an initial estimate of 
the incremental manufacturers’ direct costs (or variable costs) for high-volume production of 
these technologies.   In the case of some very new technologies, the agency may have only had 
cost estimates from low volume products and has assumed that the products have not matured in 
the development production cycle and that a “learning curve” will result in a reduction in the 
variable cost of the product by 20 percent.  The technologies to which the learning curve factors 
were applied are shown in Table V-3.  The variable costs are marked up by a factor of 1.5 to take 
into account fixed costs of R&D, burden, manufacturer’s profits, and dealer’s profits.  The final 
results are shown in Table V-1. 
 
The variable costs are incremental costs in material, labor, and variable burden for the product.  
For example, if a vehicle already has a 4-speed automatic transmission, the cost of applying a 5-
speed transmission is assumed to be the incremental cost, calculated as the cost of applying a 5-
speed transmission less the cost of applying the previously applied 4-speed automatic 
transmission.   
 
The learning curve 
For some of the technologies, we have included a learning factor.  The “learning curve” 
describes the reduction in unit production costs as a function of accumulated production volume 
and small redesigns that reduce costs.   
 
A typical learning curve can be described by three parameters: (1) the initial production volume 
before cost reductions begin to be realized; (2) the rate at which cost reductions occur with 
increases in cumulative production beyond this initial volume (usually referred to as the 
“learning rate”); and (3) the production volume after which costs reach a “floor,” and further cost 
reductions no longer occur.  Over the region where costs decline with accumulating production 
volume, an experience curve can be expressed as C(Q) = aQ-b, where a is a constant coefficient, 
Q represents cumulative production, and b is a coefficient corresponding to the assumed learning 
rate.  In turn, the learning rate L, which  is usually expressed as the percent by which average 
unit cost declines with a doubling of cumulative production, and is related to the value of the 
coefficient b by L = 100*(1 – 2-b)136. 
 
Figure VII-1 illustrates a learning curve for a vehicle technology with an initial average unit cost 
of $100 and a learning rate of approximately 20 percent.  In this hypothetical example, the initial

Energy Technologies,” paper presented at Workshop on Learning-by-Doing in Energy Technologies, Resources for 
the Future, Washington, D.C., June 17-18, 2003, pp. 1-2.  Another common but equivalent formulation of the 
relationship between L and b is (1-L)=2-b, where (1-L) is referred to as the progress ratio; see Richard P. Rumelt,

Most studies of the effect of the learning curve on production costs appear to assume that cost 
reductions begin only after some initial volume threshold has been reached, but not all of these 
studies specify the threshold volume.  The rate at which costs decline beyond the initial threshold 
is usually expressed as the percent reduction in average unit cost that results from each 
successive doubling of cumulative production volume, sometimes referred to as the learning rate.  
Many estimates of learning experience curves do not specify a cumulative production volume 
beyond which cost reductions no longer occur, instead depending on the asymptotic behavior of 
the above expression of (CQ) for learning rates below 100 percent to establish a floor on costs.

In past rulemaking analyses, EPA has used a learning curve factor of 20 percent for each 
doubling of production volume.  For this analysis, however, NHTSA has applied learning curve 
cost reductions on a manufacturer-specific basis, and have assumed that learning-based 
reductions in technology costs occur once during the time that a manufacturer applies the given 
technology to 25,000 cars or trucks, and are repeated a second time as it produces another 25,000 
cars or trucks for the second learning step (car and truck volumes are treated separately for 
determining these sales volumes).  The volumes chosen represent our best estimate for where 
learning would occur.  As such, NHTSA believes that these estimates are better suited to this 
analysis than the more general approach used by EPA in past rules, because each manufacturer 
would be implementing technologies at its own pace in this rule, rather than assuming that all 
manufacturers implement each identical technology at the same time.  The volumes chosen 
represent our best estimate for where learning would occur.   
 
For this analysis, the agency has used engineering judgment to estimate the development 
production cycle and maturity level for each technology.  After having produced 25,000 cars or 
trucks with a specific part or system, we believe that sufficient learning will have taken place 
such that costs will be lower by 20 percent for some technologies and 10 percent for others.  
After another 25,000 units for some technologies, another cost reduction will have been realized.  
When we applied a learning curve, we applied a 20 percent learning factor for all newly applied 
technologies except for diesel engines.  We have applied a 10 percent factor for diesel costs here 
because we believe that the diesel technologies being considered are reaching their “learned” 
limit and, therefore, less learning reductions are available.138

Recipes Approach to Modeling Technological Innovation: An Application to Learning by Doing,” Journal of 
Economic Dynamics and Control, Vol. 24 (2000), pp. 389-450.  
 
138 Importantly, diesel technologies can still be considered to have some learning left given recent announcements by 
General Motors stating potential cost savings associated with their new 4.5 liter Duramax diesel V8 engine (see 
Automotive News, September 24, 2007).

For each of the technologies, we have considered whether we could project future cost 
reductions due to manufacturer learning.  In making this determination, we considered whether 
or not the technology was in wide-spread use today or expected to be by the model year 2011 
time frame, in which case no future learning curve would apply because the technology is 
already in wide-spread production by the automotive industry today, e.g., on the order of multi-
millions of units per year.  (Examples of these include 5-speed automatic transmissions and 
intake-cam phasing variable valve timing.  These technologies have been in production for light-
duty vehicles for more than 10 years.)  In addition, we carefully considered the underlying 
source data for our cost estimate.  If the source data specifically stated that manufacturer cost 
reduction from future learning would occur, we took that information into account in 
determining whether we would apply manufacturer learning in our cost projections.  Thus, for 
many of the technologies, we have not applied any future cost reduction learning curve. 
 
However, there are a number of technologies which are not yet in mass production for which we 
have estimated the initial cost will be reduced in the time frame of this rule due to manufacturer 
production learning.  As indicated in Table V-3, we have applied the learning curve beginning in 
2011 to one set of technologies, and for a number of additional technologies we did not apply 
manufacturer learning until 2014.  The distinction between 2011 and 2014 is due to our source 
data for our cost estimates.  For those technologies where we have applied manufacturer learning 
in 2011, the source of our cost estimate did not rely on manufacturer learning to develop the 
initial cost estimate we have used – therefore we apply the manufacturer learning methodology 
beginning in 2011.   
 
The technologies for which we do not begin applying learning until 2014 all have the same 
reference source, the 2004 NESCCAF study, for which the sub-contractor was The Martec 
Group.  In the work done for the 2004 NESCCAF report, Martec relied upon actual price quotes 
from Tier 1 automotive suppliers to develop automotive manufacturer cost estimates. Based on 
information presented by Martec to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee during 
their January 24, 2008 public meeting in Dearborn, Michigan[1], the agency understands that the 
Martec cost estimates done for the NESCCAF report incorporated some element of manufacturer 
learning.  Martec informed stated that the Tier 1 suppliers were specifically requested to provide 
price quotes which would be valid for three years (2009-2011), and that for some components 
the Tier 1 supplier included cost reductions in years two and three which the supplier anticipated 
could occur, and which they anticipated would be necessary in order for their quote to be 
competitive with other suppliers.  Therefore, for this analysis, we did not apply any learning 
curve to any of the Martec-sourced costs for the first three years of this proposal (2011-2013).  
However, the theory of manufacturer learning is that it is a continuous process, though the rate of 
improvement decreases as the number of units produced increases.  While we were not able to 
gain access to the detailed submissions from Tier 1 suppliers which Martec relied upon for their 
estimates, we do believe that additional cost reductions will occur in the future for a number of 
the technologies for which we relied upon the Martec cost estimates for the reasons stated above 
in reference to the general learning curve effect.  For those technologies we applied a learning

curve beginning in 2014.   Martec has recently submitted a study to the NAS Committee 
comparing the 2004 NESCAF study with new updated cost information.  Given that this study 
had just been completely, the agency could not take it into consideration for the NPRM.  
However, the agency will review the new study and consider its findings in time for the final 
rule. 
 
Manufacturers’ actual costs for applying these technologies to specific vehicle models are likely 
to include significant additional outlays for accompanying design or engineering changes to each 
model, development and testing of prototype versions, recalibrating engine operating parameters, 
and integrating the technology with other attributes of the vehicle.  Manufacturers may also incur 
additional corporate overhead, marketing, or distribution and selling expenses as a consequence 
of their efforts to improve the fuel economy of individual vehicle models and their overall 
product lines.  
 
In order to account for these additional costs, the agency applies an indirect cost multiplier of 1.5 
to its estimate of the vehicle manufacturers’ direct costs for producing or acquiring each fuel 
economy-improving technology to arrive at a consumer cost.  This estimate was developed by 
Argonne National Laboratory in a recent review of vehicle manufacturers’ indirect costs.  The 
Argonne study was specifically intended to improve the accuracy of future cost estimates for 
production of vehicles that achieve high fuel economy by employing many of the same advanced 
technologies considered in the agency’s analysis.139  Thus, its recommendation that a multiplier 
of 1.5 be applied to direct manufacturing costs to reflect manufacturers’ increased indirect costs 
for deploying advanced fuel economy technologies appears to be appropriate for use in the 
agency’s current analysis.  Historically, NHTSA has used almost the exact same multiplier, a 
multiplier of 1.51, as the markup from variable costs or direct manufacturing costs to consumer 
costs.  This markup takes into account fixed costs, burden, manufacturer’s profit, and dealers 
profit.   NHTSA’s methodology for developing this markup factor was recently peer reviewed 
(see Docket No.27453-4). 
 
Potential opportunity costs of improved fuel economy 
An important concern is whether achieving the fuel economy improvements required by 
alternative CAFE standards would require manufacturers to compromise the performance, 
carrying capacity, safety, or comfort of their vehicles.  If it did so, the resulting sacrifice in the 
value of these attributes to vehicle buyers would represent an additional cost of achieving the 
required improvements in fuel economy, and thus of manufacturers’ compliance with stricter 
CAFE standards.  While exact dollar values of these attributes to buyers are extremely difficult 
to infer from vehicle purchase prices, it is nevertheless clear that changes in these attributes can 
affect the utility that vehicle provide to their owners, and thus their value to potential buyers.   
 
The agency has approached this potential problem by developing cost estimates for fuel 
economy-improving technologies that include any additional manufacturing costs that would be 
necessary to maintain the performance, comfort, capacity, or safety of any vehicle to which those 
technologies are applied.  In doing so, the agency followed the precedent established by NAS in

Manufacturing, Center for Transportation Research, Argonne National Laboratory, April 2000.

its 2002 analysis of the costs and benefits of improving fuel economy by raising CAFE 
standards.140  The NAS study estimated “constant performance and utility” costs for fuel 
economy technologies, and the agency has used these as the basis for developing the technology 
costs it employed in analyzing manufacturer’s costs for complying with alternative standards.   
 
NHTSA fully acknowledges the difficulty of estimating technology costs that include costs for 
the accompanying changes in vehicle design that are necessary to maintain performance, 
capacity, and utility.  However, the agency believes its cost estimates for fuel economy 
technologies are generally sufficient to prevent significant reductions in consumer welfare.  
 
The technology application algorithm implemented with the Volpe model was used as the basis 
for estimating costs for the fleet.  We applied the technology application algorithm described in 
Chapter VI.   
   
The agency did estimate the costs or fines to bring passenger car manufacturers up to the 27.5 
mpg level in place for MY 2010 as shown in Table VII-2.  Table VII-3 shows the estimates for 
those light truck manufacturers that are not planning on meeting the CAFE reform level for MY 
2011, without using fuel economy adjustments for alternative fueled vehicles, up to the level 
required for them for MY 2011.  These costs have been estimated, but they are not considered to 
be part of the costs of meeting the proposed requirements.  Those costs, and commensurate 
benefits, are considered part of the costs and benefits of complying with previously issued rules.   
 
Tables VII-4a through 4n for passenger cars and Tables VII-5a through 5n show the costs for 
light trucks (on an average cost-per-vehicle basis and on a total cost basis) of applying 
technology necessary to move each manufacturer’s planned fuel economy levels up to the level 
of the alternative.  Thus, if a manufacturer’s product plans resulted in a fuel economy level of 
22.2 mpg during each model year, the cost represents the cumulative cost of technologies 
necessary to bring that manufacturer’s fleet average up to the levels of the alternative.  The costs 
for several manufacturers are the fines that these manufacturers would have to pay on an average 
vehicle basis.  We assume that the costs of fines will be passed on to consumers.   The second 
part of each of these tables shows the estimated total manufacturer costs in millions of dollars.  
Fines are not included in the second part of these tables, since these are transfer payments and 
not technology costs.

Financial Impacts of Raising CAFE Standards 
The agency does not have the capability to predict the capital investment needs of the automobile 
industry to install fuel economy technologies, nor the capability to determine the level of capital 
investments available to specific manufacturers in the future.  The analysis estimates the price 
increases in total for each manufacturer, under the assumption that prices would be increased and 
the manufacturer would get back that investment when the vehicles are sold.  However, that 
methodology does not determine whether automobile manufacturers can pay for research and 
development, plant changes, and tooling necessary to get the technology into the vehicles in the 
first place.  In essence this is a cash flow question.  Do they have the cash reserves or can they 
borrow enough money to fund this process?  The implicit assumption in the analysis is yes.   
 
A significant portion of the capital needs will fall upon suppliers to the automobile 
manufacturers, those companies that develop and sell engines, transmissions, and other fuel 
economy technologies.  So, the capital needs are spread out to both the suppliers and original 
equipment manufacturers.   
 
The agency would like to have a more informed opinion on the ability of manufacturers to 
provide the capital investment needs for the various alternatives.  In light of these unknowns, the 
agency is seeking information regarding the manufacturers financial capabilities in meeting this 
proposal and the alternatives examined.  Specific questions are as follows:    
    
QUESTIONS FOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS 
1. For each of the model years 2011-2015, please provide the best possible estimate of the 
incremental capital investments required for your company to comply with the 
alternatives discussed in this analysis  (25% Below Optimized, Optimized (7%), 25% 
Above Optimized, 50% Above Optimized, Optimized (3%), TC = TB, and Technology 
Exhaustion.  Capital investments are defined here by asset class and consist of outlays for 
property, plant, machinery, equipment, and special tools used in the production process 
by vehicle manufacturers and suppliers.  Incremental investments are defined as those 
directly attributed to the fuel economy improvements and would not be incurred in the 
absence of the new requirements. 
 
2. To the degree possible, please provide the above utilizing the elements below for each 
model year presenting passenger cars and LTV’S separately (suppliers can supply data by 
model year).  NHTSA understands that the adoption of flexible assembly in which 
production of passenger cars and many LTV’S are integrated onto the same line may 
make such distinctions infeasible, particularly in the out-years.  In such cases, a combined 
PC/ LTV estimate for each element below will suffice.  The agency further acknowledges 
that estimates of capital requirements for the out-years must contain, by nature, a high 
degree of uncertainty.

Asset Classification  Capital Investment      Write-off Period    
       (Incremental) 
New Property    $-    In years 
Plant          $-    In years 
Machinery& Equipment  $-    In years 
Special Tooling   $-    In years 
 
 
3.  Please discuss whether you anticipate that your firm will to be able to raise the incremental 
capital investments necessary to meet the levels predicted in answer to the questions above.  If 
the answer is no, what level appears likely to be achievable.  What alternatives are available to 
raise the incremental capital investments necessary?     
 
 
The Impact of Higher Prices on Sales 
 
Higher fuel economy standards are expected to increase the price of passenger cars and light 
trucks.  The potential impact of higher vehicle prices on sales was examined on a manufacturer-
specific basis, since the estimated cost of improving fuel economy and the fuel economy 
improvement is different for each manufacturer.  There is a broad consensus in the economic 
literature that the price elasticity for demand for automobiles is approximately –1.0.141,142,143 
Thus, every one percent increase in the price of the vehicle would reduce sales by one percent.  
Elasticity estimates assume no perceived change in the quality of the product.  However, in this 
case, vehicle price increases result from adding technologies that improve fuel economy.  If 
consumers do not value improved fuel economy at all, and consider nothing but the increase in 
price in their purchase decisions, then the estimated impact on sales from price elasticity could 
be applied directly.  However, we believe that consumers do value improved fuel economy, 
because they reduce the operating cost of the vehicles.  We also believe that consumers consider 
other factors that affect their costs and have included these in the analysis.    
 
To estimate the average value consumers place on fuel savings at the time of purchase, we 
assume that the average purchaser considers the fuel savings they would receive over a 5 year 
timeframe.  We chose 5 years because this is the average length of time of a financing 
agreement. 144   The present values of these savings were calculated using a 3 percent discount 
rate, which is more consistent with the real (after-inflation) rate that consumers receive from 
their own personal savings in banks, etc, than the 7 percent discount factor.   We used a fuel 
price forecast (see Table VIII-3) that included taxes, because this is what consumers must pay.  
Fuel savings were calculated over the first 5 years and discounted back to a present value.

The agency believes that consumers may consider several other factors over the 5 year horizon 
when contemplating the purchase of a new vehicle.  The agency added these factors into the 
calculation to represent how an increase in technology costs might affect consumers’ buying 
considerations.   
 
First, consumers might consider the sales taxes they have to pay at the time of purchasing the 
vehicle.  We took sales taxes in 2007 by state and weighted them by population by state to 
determine a national weighted-average sales tax of 5.5 percent.    
 
Second, we considered insurance costs over the 5 year period.  More expensive vehicles will 
require more expensive collision and comprehensive (e.g., theft) car insurance. According to the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) the national average premium for 
collision + comprehensive insurance in 2000 was $389 while the average new car transaction 
price was $20,600.  If we assume that this premium is proportional to the new car price, it 
represents about 1.9 percent of the new car price and insurance is paid each year for the five year 
period we are considering for payback.  Discounting that stream of insurance costs back to 
present value using a 3 percent discount rate suggests that the present value of the component of 
insurance costs that vary with vehicle price is equal to about 8.0 percent of the vehicle’s price.     
 
Third, we considered that 70 percent of new vehicle purchasers take out loans to finance their 
purchase.  The average new vehicle loan is for 5 years at a 6 percent rate145.  At these terms the 
average person taking a loan will pay 16 percent more for their vehicle over the 5 years than a 
consumer paying cash for the vehicle at the time of purchase146.  Discounting the additional 3.2 
percent (16 percent / 5 years) per year over the 5 years using a 3 percent mid-year discount 
rate147 results in a discounted present value of 14.87 percent higher for those taking a loan.  
Multiplying that by the 70 percent that take a loan, means that the average consumer would pay 
10.4 percent more than the retail price for loans.      
 
Fourth, we considered the residual value (or resale value) of the vehicle after 5 years and 
expressed this as a percentage of the new vehicle price.  In other words, if the price of the vehicle 
increases due to fuel economy technologies, the resale value of the vehicle will go up 
proportionately.  To estimate that value, we looked at 138 model year 2002 vehicles to compare 
their original MSRP values (based on www.nadaguides.com) to their current trade-in values (5 
years later in 2007 based on www.edmunds.com).  The sales weighted average residual value for 
this group of vehicles was 37.5 percent.  Discounting the residual value back 5 years using a 3 
percent discount rate (37.5 percent * .8755) gives an effective residual value at new of 32.8 
percent. 
 
These four factors together, the consumer considering he could get 32.8 percent back upon resale 
in 5 years, but will pay 10.4 percent more for loans, 5.5 percent more for taxes and 8.0 percent 
                                                 
145  New car loan rates in 2007 average about 7.8 percent at commercial banks and 4.5 percent at auto finance 
companies, so their average is close to 7 percent 
146  Based on www.bankrate.com auto loan calculator for a 5 year loan at 6 percent.    
147 The summation of 3.2 percent x 0.9853 in year one, 3.2 x 0.9566 in year two, 3.2 x 0.9288 in year three, 3.2 x 
0.9017 in year 4, and 3.2 x 0.8755 in year five.

more in insurance, results in a 8.9 percent return on the increase in price for fuel economy 
technology   (32.8 percent – 10.4 percent - 5.5 percent – 8.0 percent).   Thus, the increase in price 
per vehicle is multiplied by 0.911 (1 – 0.089) before subtracting the fuel savings to determine the 
overall net consumer valuation the increase of costs on his purchase decision.   
 
Using sales volumes from Automotive News and the Automotive News 2006 Market Data Book 
for base vehicle average prices for MY 2006, we determined an average passenger car and an 
average light truck price per manufacturer.   The average base price for all passenger cars using 
this method was $22,857 and for all light trucks was $26,090.  While this method does not give 
an exact price, the results are reasonable and specific to individual manufacturers148.  These 
prices are in 2006 dollars.   Average prices and estimated sales volumes are needed because price 
elasticity is an estimate of how a percent increase in price affects the percent decrease in sales.   
 
A sample calculation for Ford passenger cars under the Optimized 7% alternative in MY 2011 is 
an estimated retail price increase of $782, which is multiplied by 0.911 to get a residual price 
increase of $712.  The estimated fuel savings over the 5 years of $281 at a 3 percent discount rate 
results in a net cost to consumers of $431.  Comparing that to the $21,821 average price is 2.39 
percent price increase.  Ford sales were estimated to be about 1,300,000 passenger cars for MY 
2011.  With a price elasticity of –1.0, a 2.39 percent increase in sales could result in an estimated 
loss in sales of 3,104 passenger cars at a 3 percent discount rate. 
 
Sales increases occur when the value of improved fuel economy exceeds the consumer cost of 
added technology.  Overall, the 25% Below Optimized and the proposed Optimized (7%) 
alternatives result in a gain in sales, while the other alternatives result in almost progressively 
larger losses in sales.  Tables VII-6a through 6g show the estimated impact on sales for 
passenger cars and light trucks combined.     
 
Our projections indicate that CAFE standards will result in sales increases for some 
manufacturers under some scenarios.  These results rest on several assumptions about consumer 
behavior, in particular, how consumers value fuel economy increases.  If consumers are 
completely unable to perceive any increases in fuel economy, then they would treat the vehicle 
price increases resulting from CAFE standards as pure price increases without any corresponding 
quality increase.  Under those circumstances, one would expect vehicle sales to fall in 
accordance with the price elasticity of demand discussed earlier.  Our projections of sales 
increases rest on the assumption that consumers will correctly perceive at least some of the 
increase in fuel economy and therefore be willing to pay somewhat more for a vehicle with 
greater fuel economy.  Even if consumers value only a portion of the resulting fuel savings, there 
are instances where those fuel savings are nonetheless projected to be large enough to exceed the 
increased vehicle price, thus leading to an increase in sales.  However, this assumption raises the 
following question:  If some fraction of fuel economy improvements (as perceived and valued by 
vehicle purchasers) is large enough to exceed the increased vehicle cost (and result in an increase 
in vehicle sales), then what would be the nature of the market failure such that those levels of 
fuel economy would not exist but for a CAFE mandate?  To better understand this issue, NHTSA 
                                                 
148  The base price does not include the more expensive lines of a model or purchased optional equipment; nor does 
it count discounts given.  Thus, it is not an average light truck purchase transaction price, but a price that we can 
track.   
  
VII-44
seeks comment on the following questions:  What evidence or data exist that indicate the extent 
to which consumers undervalue fuel economy improvements?  Under what circumstances is it 
reasonable to expect that a mandated increase in fuel economy would lead to an increase in 
vehicle sales?    
 
Note that there is no feedback loop between this sales analysis and the Volpe model.  These sales 
estimates are not used to determine additional or less mileage traveled or fuel consumed.  Also, 
see the earlier discussion about a market share model in Chapter V.

Potential Impact on Employment 
There are three potential areas of employment that fuel economy standards could impact.  The 
first is the hiring of additional engineers by automobile companies and their suppliers to do 
research and development and testing on new technologies to determine their capabilities, 
durability, platform introduction, etc. The agency does not anticipate a huge number of 
incremental jobs in the engineering field.  Often people would be diverted from one area to 
another and the incremental number of jobs might be a few thousand.   
 
The second area is the impact that new technologies would have on the production line.  Again, 
we don’t anticipate a large number of incremental workers, as for the most part you are replacing 
one engine with another or one transmission with another.  In some instances the technology is 
more complex, requiring more parts and there would be a small increase in the number of 
production employees, but we don’t anticipate a large change.    
 
The third area is the potential impact that sales gains or losses could have on production 
employment.  This area is potentially much more sensitive to change than the first two areas 
discussed above.  In the past, the agency and others have made estimates of the impact of sales 
losses on employment.  In the final rule reducing the light truck fuel economy standard for MY 
1985, the agency concluded that sales losses of 100,000 to 180,000 would result in employment 
losses of 12,000 to 23,000 (49 FR 41252, October 22, 1984).149  In the final rule reducing the 
MY 1986 passenger car fuel economy standard, the agency concluded that while it was difficult 
to precisely estimate the impacts, “there would be a likelihood of sales losses well into the 
hundreds of thousands of units and job losses well into the tens of thousands.  Sales and 
employment losses of these magnitudes would have significant adverse effects on the economy 
… ” (50 FR 40538, October 4, 1985).  In the final rule amending the passenger car standards for 
MY 1987 and 1988, the agency said that “… domestic car production may fall by more than 
900,000 units.  The short employment effects are substantial: over 130,000 jobs…” (51 FR 
35598, October 6, 1986).  These estimates imply a ratio between the number of vehicles sales 
lost and the number of employees laid off in the 1980s of between 6.9 (900,000/130,000) and 8.3 
(100,000/12,000).   
 
Certainly productivity has increased since that time.  In order to get an estimate of potential job 
losses per sales loss, we examined more recent U.S. employment (original equipment 
manufacturers and suppliers) and U.S. production.  Total employment in 2000 reached a peak in 
the Motor Vehicle and Equipment Manufacturing sector of the economy at 1,313,600.  Since 
then there has been a decline to 1,108,000 in 2003 and to 1,098,000 in 2005150.  Averaging those 
three years, the average U.S. domestic employee produces 10.5 vehicles.  Thus, one could 
assume that projected sales loss divided by 10.5 would give an estimate of the potential 
employment loss.   
                                                 
149 The agency’s decision to lower standards based on that amount of impacts identified in the 1985 rule was upheld 
by the DC Circuit in Public Citizen v. NHTSA, 848 F.2d 256.

At this time, the agency considers these effects to occur in the short to medium term (meaning up 
to 5 years).  Over the next few years, consumers can elect to defer vehicle purchases by 
continuing to operate existing vehicles.  Eventually, however, the rising maintenance costs for 
aging vehicles will make replacements look more attractive.  
 
However, vehicle owners may also react to persistently higher vehicle costs by permanently 
owning fewer vehicles, and keeping existing vehicles in service for somewhat longer.  In this 
case, the possibility exists that there may be permanent sales losses, compared with a situation in 
which vehicle prices are lower. 
 
The 25% Sub Optimizes and the proposed Optimized (7%) alternative would have positive 
impacts on employment.  The other alternatives have negative impacts on employment.  
Combining the sales effect on passenger cars and light trucks, the impact on employment is 
estimated in the following table.

Economic Impacts from Higher CAFE Standards 
 
Economic impacts from adopting a more stringent CAFE standard for passenger cars and light 
trucks were estimated separately for each model year over the lifespan of those vehicles in the 
U.S. vehicle fleet, extending from the initial year when a model is offered for sale through the 
year when nearly all vehicles from that model year have been retired or scrapped (assumed to be 
26 years for passenger cars and 36 years for light trucks in this analysis).  The principal source of 
the economic and environmental impacts considered in this analysis is the reduction in gasoline 
use resulting from the improvement in fuel economy of new light-duty vehicles produced.  
Reducing gasoline consumption provides consumer benefits through decreased fuel costs, 
through reduced costs for externalities such as demand price inflation, economic disruption, and 
military security, through reduced economic and health impacts from criteria pollutants and 
green house gas emissions, through increased driving ranges for vehicles, and through consumer 
surplus from added driving.  Offsetting a part of these benefits are added costs from congestion, 
crashes, and noise, as well as some offset to fuel consumption and pollution savings, all due to an 
increase in driving that results from lower driving costs (the rebound effect).   Each of these 
impacts is measured by comparing their value under each alternative approach to their value 
under the adjusted baseline.  Future impacts are estimated after discounting to the year the 
vehicle is sold to determine their present value.151   
 
Basic Inputs for Analysis of Economic Impacts 
The variety of impacts discussed above are a function of basic factors which determine their 
magnitude and define their value.  These include the discount rate, the level of vehicle sales, the 
magnitude of the rebound effect, and the relationship between EPA measured fuel efficiency and 
actual on-road fuel efficiency. 
 
The Discount Rate 
Discounting future fuel savings and other benefits is intended to account for the reduction in their value to 
society when they are deferred until some future date rather than received immediately.  The discount rate 
expresses the percent decline in the value of these benefits – as viewed from today’s perspective – for 
each year they are deferred into the future.  Discount rates are used in a variety of analyses that address 
different aspects of benefit valuation.  These include: 1)  selecting a set of standards  2) analyzing the 
impact of those standards  3)  examining the impact of uncertainty surrounding our choice of rates used to 
analyze impacts, and 4) determining the sensitivity of standards selection to the discount rate.  However, 
the agency must select one specific rate to set the standards.  The agency uses a rate of 7 percent per year 
to discount the value of future fuel savings and other benefits when it analyzes the potential impacts of 
alternative passenger car and light truck CAFE standards.  OMB Circular A-4 requires that the agency 
examine costs and benefits of proposed standards using discount rates of both 3 percent and 7 percent.   
The 3 percent rate generally represents the consumer rate of time preference while the 7 percent rate 
generally represents the economy-wide opportunity cost of capital.  Benefits based on both of these rates 
are presented to value the benefits that are associated with the standards set in this proposal.  The agency 
                                                 
151 Discounting to the year when each model year was produced allows future economic benefits from improving 
each model year’s fuel economy to be compared to added production costs for making those vehicles more fuel-
efficient, which are assumed to be incurred at the time those vehicles are manufactured. 
 
  
VIII-2
uses discount rates ranging from 3 percent to 10 percent per year to analyze the uncertainty surrounding 
the future impacts of alternative standards.   
 
There are several reasons for the agency’s choice of 7 percent as the appropriate discount rate to 
determine the standards.  First, OMB Circular A-4 indicates that this rate reflects the economy-
wide opportunity cost of capital.  The agency believes that a substantial portion of the cost of this 
regulation may come at the expense of other investments the auto manufacturers might otherwise 
make.  Several large manufacturers are resource-constrained with respect to their engineering 
and product-development capabilities.  As a result, other uses of these resources will be foregone 
while they are required to be applied to technologies that improve fuel economy.   
 
Second, 7 percent also appears to be an appropriate rate to the extent that the costs of the 
regulation come at the expense of consumption as opposed to investment.  The agency believes 
that financing rates on vehicle loans represent an appropriate discount rate, because they reflect 
the opportunity costs faced by consumers when buying vehicles with greater fuel economy and a 
higher purchase price.  Most new and used vehicle purchases are financed, and because most of 
the benefits from higher fuel economy standards accrue to vehicle purchasers in the form of fuel 
savings, the appropriate discount rate is the interest rate buyers pay on loans to finance their 
vehicle purchases.152   
 
According to the Federal Reserve, the interest rate on new car loans made through commercial 
banks has closely tracked the rate on 10-year treasury notes, but exceeded it by about 3 
percent.153  The official Administration forecast is that real interest rates on 10-year treasury 
notes will average about 3 percent through 2016, implying that 6 percent is a reasonable forecast 
for the real interest rate on new car loans.154  In turn, the interest rate on used car loans made 
through automobile financing companies has closely tracked the rate on new car loans made 
through commercial banks, but exceeded it by about 3 percent.155  (The agency believes it is 
important to consider rates on loans that finance used car purchases, because some of the fuel 
savings resulting from improved fuel economy accrue to used car buyers.)  Given the 6 percent 
estimate for new car loans, a reasonable forecast for used car loans is thus 9 percent.   
 
Because the benefits of fuel economy accrue to both new and used car owners, a discount rate 
between 6 percent and 9 percent is thus appropriate for evaluating future benefits resulting from 
higher fuel economy.  Assuming that new car buyers discount fuel savings at 6 percent for 5 
years (the average duration of a new car loan) 156 and that used car buyers discount fuel savings 
at 9 percent for 5 years (the average duration of a used car loan)157, the single constant discount 
rate that yields equivalent present value fuel savings is very close to 7 percent. 
                                                 
152 Empirical evidence also demonstrates that used car purchasers do pay for greater fuel economy (Kahn, Quarterly 
Journal of Economics, 1986).

However, the Agency recognizes that there are arguments for using 3 percent as well.  Namely 
that OMB requests benefits to be estimated at both 3 percent as well as 7 percent and that the 
official Administration forecast is that real interest rates on 10-year treasury notes will average 
about 3 percent through 2016.  Although the agency feels that the arguments for 7% are stronger, 
we have calculated results under both 3% and 7% to demonstrate the impact of the lower 
discount rate on the resulting standards.    
 
Sales Projections 
 
A critical variable affecting the total economic benefits from improving light truck fuel economy 
is the number of vehicles likely to be produced under stricter fuel economy.  Projections of total 
passenger cars and light truck sales for future years (see Table VIII-1a and VIII-1b) were 
obtained from the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook 2007 
(AEO 2007), a standard government reference for projections of energy production and 
consumption in different sectors of the U.S. economy.158   NHTSA estimated the sales by 
manufacturer, based on their market shares in the NHTSA MY2006 CAFE data base.  These 
values will be used as multipliers to estimate the overall impacts (both costs and benefits) of 
changes in fuel economy standards.

The “Rebound Effect” 
 
The rebound effect refers to the tendency for owners to increase the number of miles they drive a 
vehicle in response to an increase in its fuel economy, as would result from more stringent fuel 
economy standards.  The rebound effect occurs because an increase in a vehicle’s fuel economy 
reduces its owner’s fuel cost for driving each mile, which is typically the largest single 
component of the cost of operating a vehicle.  Even with the vehicle’s higher fuel economy, this 
additional driving uses some fuel, so the rebound effect will reduce the net fuel savings that 
result when the fuel economy standards require manufacturers to increase fuel economy.  The 
rebound effect is usually expressed as the percentage by which annual vehicle use increases 
when average fuel cost per mile driven decreases in response to a change in the marginal cost of 
driving an extra mile, due either an increase in fuel economy or a reduction in the price of fuel.  
  
VIII-6
 
The magnitude of the rebound effect is one of the determinants of the actual fuel savings that are 
likely to result from adopting stricter standards, and thus an important parameter affecting 
NHTSA’s evaluation of alternative standards for future model years.  The rebound effect can be 
measured directly by estimating the elasticity of vehicle use with respect to fuel economy itself, 
or indirectly by the elasticity of vehicle use with respect to fuel cost per mile driven.159  When 
expressed as a positive percentage, either of these parameters gives the fraction of fuel savings 
that would otherwise result from adopting stricter standards, but is offset by the increase in fuel 
consumption that results when vehicles with increased fuel economy are driven more.  
 
Research on the magnitude of the rebound effect in light-duty vehicle use dates to the early 
1980s, and almost unanimously concludes that a statistically significant rebound effect occurs 
when vehicle fuel efficiency improves.160  The most common approach to estimating its 
magnitude has been to analyze statistically household survey data on vehicle use, fuel 
consumption, fuel prices (often obtained from external sources), and other determinants of 
household travel demand to isolate the response of vehicle use to higher fuel economy.  Other 
studies have relied on econometric analysis of annual U.S. data on vehicle use, fuel economy, 
fuel prices, and other variables to identify the response of total or average vehicle use to changes 
in fleet-wide average fuel economy and its effect of fuel cost per mile driven.  Two recent studies 
analyzed yearly variation in vehicle ownership and use, fuel prices, and fuel economy among 
individual states over an extended time period in order to measure the response of vehicle use to 
changing fuel economy.161  
 
An important distinction among studies of the rebound effect is whether they assume that the 
effect is constant, or varies over time in response to the absolute levels of fuel costs, personal 
income, or household vehicle ownership.  Most studies using aggregate annual data for the U.S. 
assume a constant rebound effect, although some of these studies test whether the effect can vary 
as changes in retail fuel prices or average fuel economy alter fuel cost per mile driven.  Many 
studies using household survey data estimate significantly different rebound effects for 
households owning varying numbers of vehicles, although they arrive at differing conclusions 
about whether the rebound effect is larger among households that own more vehicles.  One 
recent study using state-level data concludes that the rebound effect varies directly in response to 
changes in personal income and the degree of urbanization of U.S. cities, as well as fuel costs.   
 
In order to arrive at a preliminary estimate of the rebound effect for use in assessing the fuel 
savings, emissions reductions, and other impacts of alternative standards, NHTSA reviewed 22 
studies of the rebound effect conducted from 1983 through 2005.  We then conducted a detailed 
analysis of the 66 separate estimates of the long-run rebound effect reported in these studies, 
                                                 
159 Fuel cost per mile is equal to the price of fuel in dollars per gallon divided by fuel economy in miles per gallon, 
so this figure declines when a vehicle’s fuel economy increases. 
160 Some studies estimate that the long-run rebound effect is significantly larger than the immediate response to 
increased fuel efficiency.  Although their estimates of the adjustment period required for the rebound effect to reach 
its long-run magnitude vary, this long-run effect is most appropriate for evaluating the fuel savings and emissions 
reductions resulting from stricter standards that would apply to future model years.  
161 In effect, these studies treat U.S. states as a data “panel” by applying appropriate estimation procedures to data 
consisting of each year’s average values of these variables for the separate states.  
  
VIII-7
which is summarized in the table below.162  As the table indicates, these 66 estimates of the long-
run rebound effect range from as low as 7 percent to as high as 75 percent, with a mean value of 
23 percent.   
 
Limiting the sample to 50 estimates reported in the 17 published studies of the rebound effect 
yields the same range but a slightly higher mean (24 percent), while focusing on the authors’ 
preferred estimates from published studies narrows this range and lowers its average only 
slightly.  The median estimate of the rebound effect in all three samples, which is generally 
regarded as a more reliable indicator of their central tendency than the average because it is less 
influenced by unusually small and large estimates, is 22 percent.  As Table 13 indicates, 
approximately two-thirds of all estimates reviewed, of all published estimates, and of authors’ 
preferred estimates fall in the range of 10-30 percent.

The type of data used and authors’ assumption about whether the rebound effect varies over time 
have important effects on its estimated magnitude.  The 34 estimates derived from analysis of 
U.S. annual time-series data produce a median estimate of 14 percent for the long-run rebound 
effect, while the median of 23 estimates based on household survey data is more than twice as 
large (31 percent), and the median of 9 estimates based on pooled state data matches that of the 
entire sample (22 percent).  The 37 estimates assuming a constant rebound effect produce a 
median of 20 percent, while the 29 originally reported estimates of a variable rebound effect 
have a slightly higher median value (23 percent). 
 
                                                 
162 In some cases, NHTSA derived estimates of the overall rebound effect from more detailed results reported in the 
studies.   For example, where studies estimated different rebound effects for households owning different numbers 
of vehicles but did not report an overall value, we computed a weighted average of the reported values using the 
distribution of households among vehicle ownership categories.  
  
VIII-8
In selecting a single value for the rebound effect to use in analyzing alternative standards for 
future model years, NHTSA tentatively attaches greater significance to studies that allow the 
rebound effect to vary in response to changes in the various factors that have been found to affect 
its magnitude.  However, it is also important to update authors’ originally-reported estimates of 
variable rebound effects to reflect current conditions.  Recalculating the 29 original estimates of 
variable rebound effects to reflect current (2006) values for retail fuel prices, average fuel 
economy, personal income, and household vehicle ownership reduces their median estimate to 
16 percent.163  NHTSA also tentatively attaches greater significance to the recent study by Small 
and Van Dender (2005), which finds that the rebound effect tends to decline as average fuel 
economy, personal income, and suburbanization of U.S. cities increase, but – in accordance with 
previous studies – rises with increasing fuel prices.164 
 
Considering the empirical evidence on the rebound effect as a whole, but according greater 
importance to the updated estimates from studies allowing the rebound effect to vary – 
particularly the Small and Van Dender study – NHTSA has selected a rebound effect of 15 
percent to evaluate the fuel savings and other effects of alternative standards for the time period 
covered by this rulemaking.  However, we do not believe that evidence of the rebound effect’s 
dependence on fuel prices or household income is sufficiently convincing to justify allowing its 
future value to vary in response to forecast changes in these variables.  A range extending from 
10 percent to at least 20 percent -- and perhaps as high as 25 percent -- appears to be appropriate 
for the required analysis of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates. 
 
 
 
 
On-Road Fuel Economy Adjustment 
 
Actual fuel economy levels achieved by vehicles in on-road driving fall significantly short of 
their levels measured under the laboratory-like test conditions used by EPA to establish its 
                                                 
163 As an illustration, Small and Van Dender (2005) allow the rebound effect to vary over time in response to 
changes in real per capita income as well as average fuel cost per mile driven.  While their estimate for the entire 
interval (1966-2001) they analyze is 22 percent, updating this estimate using 2006 values of these variables reduces 
the rebound effect to approximately 10 percent.  Similarly, updating Greene’s 1992 original estimate of a 15 percent 
rebound effect to reflect 2006 fuel prices and average fuel economy reduces it to 6 percent.  See David L. Greene, 
“Vehicle Use and Fuel Economy:  How Big is the Rebound Effect?” The Energy Journal, 13:1 (1992), 117-143.  In 
contrast, the distribution of households among vehicle ownership categories in the data samples used by Hensher et 
al. (1990) and Greene et al. (1999) are nearly identical to the most recent estimates for the U.S., so updating their 
original estimates to current U.S. conditions changes them very little.  See David A. Hensher, Frank W. Milthorpe, 
and Nariida C. Smith, “The Demand for Vehicle Use in the Urban Household Sector: Theory and Empirical 
Evidence,” Journal of Transport Economics and Policy, 24:2 (1990), 119-137; and David L. Greene, James R. Kahn, 
and Robert C. Gibson, “Fuel Economy Rebound Effect for Household Vehicles,” The Energy Journal, 20:3 (1999), 
1-21. 
164 In the most recent light truck CAFE rulemaking, NHTSA chose not to preference the Small and Van Dender 
study over other published estimates of the value of the rebound effect, stating that since it “remains an unpublished 
working paper that has not been subjected to formal peer review, …the agency does not yet consider the estimates it 
provides to have the same credibility as the published and widely-cited estimates it relied upon.”  See 71 FR 17633 
(Apr. 6, 2006).  The study has subsequently been published and peer-reviewed, so NHTSA is now prepared to 
“consider it in developing its own estimate of the rebound effect for use in subsequent CAFE rulemakings.”

published fuel economy ratings for different models.  In analyzing the fuel savings from 
alternative passenger car and light truck CAFE standards, the agency adjusts the actual fuel 
economy performance of each passenger car and light truck model downward from its rated 
value to reflect the expected size of this on-road fuel economy “gap.”  In December 2006, EPA 
adopted changes to its regulations on fuel economy labeling, which were intended to bring 
vehicles’ rated fuel economy levels closer to their actual on-road fuel economy levels.165   
 
Supplemental analysis reported by EPA as part of its Final Rule indicates that actual on-road fuel 
economy for light-duty vehicles averages 20 percent lower than published fuel economy 
levels.166  For example, if the overall EPA fuel economy rating of a light truck is 20 mpg, the on-
road fuel economy actually achieved by a typical driver of that vehicle is expected to be 16 mpg 
(20*.80).  The agency has employed EPA’s revised estimate of this on-road fuel economy gap in 
its analysis of the fuel savings resulting from alternative CAFE standards for MY 2011-2018 
passenger cars and MY 2012-18 light trucks.   
 
Benefits from Fuel Savings  
 
The main source of economic benefits from a fuel economy standard is the value of the resulting 
fuel savings over the lifetimes of vehicles that are required to comply with the stricter standards.  
These fuel savings for each scenario are measured by the difference between the adjusted 
baseline fuel economy for each model year and the fuel economy levels corresponding to that 
alternative.  The sum of these annual fuel savings over each calendar year that a vehicle remains 
in service represents the cumulative fuel savings resulting from applying the alternative to 
vehicles produced during that model year.   
 
As previously noted, actual fuel economy levels achieved by vehicles in on-road driving fall 
significantly short of their levels measured under the laboratory-like test conditions used by EPA 
to establish its published fuel economy ratings for different models.  In analyzing the fuel 
savings from alternative passenger car and light truck CAFE standards, the agency adjusts the 
actual fuel economy performance of each passenger car and light truck model downward from its 
rated value to reflect the expected size of this on-road fuel economy “gap.”  In December 2006, 
EPA adopted changes to its regulations on fuel economy labeling, which were intended to bring 
vehicles’ rated fuel economy levels closer to their actual on-road fuel economy levels.167   
 
Supplemental analysis reported by EPA as part of its Final Rule indicates that actual on-road fuel 
economy for light-duty vehicles averages 20 percent lower than published fuel economy

levels.168  The agency has employed EPA’s revised estimate of this on-road fuel economy gap in 
its analysis of the fuel savings resulting from alternative CAFE standards for MY 2011-2018 
passenger cars and MY 2012-18 light trucks.   
 
The number of light vehicles manufactured during each model year that remains in service 
during each subsequent calendar year is estimated by multiplying the estimated proportions of 
vehicles expected to survive to each age up to 26 years for passenger cars (Table VIII-2a) and 36 
years for light trucks (Table VIII-2b) by the number of cars and light trucks forecast to be 
produced during each year.  These “survival rates,” which are estimated from experience with 
recent model-year vehicles, are slightly different than the survival rates used in past NHTSA 
analyses since they reflect recent increases in durability and usage of more recent passenger car 
and light truck models.169  Updated estimates of average annual miles driven by vehicle age were 
developed from the Federal Highway Administration’s 2001 National Household Transportation 
Survey, and these also differ from the estimates of annual mileage employed in past NHTSA 
analyses.170  The total number of miles driven by vehicles of a single model year during each 
year of its life span in the fleet in effect is estimated by multiplying these age-specific estimates 
of annual miles driven per vehicle by the number of vehicles projected to remain in service at 
each age. 
 
Table VIII-2a and VIII-2b provide the new schedules of vehicle miles traveled and survivability 
based on updated analyses performed by NHTSA.  These were developed from registration data 
for 1977 through 2003, and from a 2001 survey of household vehicle use.  In this analysis, the 
maximum vehicle age was defined as the age when the number remaining in service has declined 
to approximately two percent of the vehicles originally produced.  Based on and examination of 
recent registration data for older model years, typical maximum ages appear to be  26 years for 
passenger cars and 36 years for light trucks.  Using the 36-year estimate of the maximum 
lifetimes of light trucks results in survival-weighted or “expected” lifetime mileage of 190,066 
miles.   Fuel savings and other benefits resulting from higher light truck CAFE standards are 
calculated over this expected 36 year lifetime and total mileage.  In contrast, NHTSA’s previous 
estimate of lifetime VMT in the 2006 final rule was 179,954 miles over a 36-year lifetime for 
light trucks.  The resulting survival-weighted mileage over the 26-year maximum lifetime of 
passenger cars is 161,847 miles, and fuel savings and other benefits resulting from higher 
passenger car CAFE standards are calculated over this 26-year lifetime and total mileage.  It 
should be noted, however, that survival-weighted VMT is extremely low (less than 1,000 miles 
per year) after age 20 for cars and age 25 for light trucks, and thus has little impact on lifetime 
fuel savings or other benefits from higher fuel economy, particularly after discounting those 
benefits to their present values.

The primary source of data for determining vehicles in operation is the National Vehicle 
Population Profile (NVPP) compiled by R.L. Polk and Company.  The NVPP is an annual 
census, as of July 1 of each year, of passenger cars and light trucks registered for on-road 
operation in the United States.  NVPP registration data was used from vehicle model years 1977 
to 2003.  Survival rates were averaged for the five most recent model years for vehicles up to 20 
years old, and regression models were fitted to these data to develop smooth relationships 
between age and the proportion of cars or light trucks surviving to that age.  The survival rates 
predicted by these models are used to develop the estimates of annual mileage and fuel 
consumption used to calculate fuel savings and other impacts of higher fuel economy.  
 
The 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)  sponsored by the Federal Highway 
Administration, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration attempted to develop up-to-date information on household vehicle ownership and 
use.  The NHTS is the integration of two previous national travel surveys: the Federal Highway 
Administration-sponsored Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) and the Bureau 
of Transportation Statistics-sponsored American Travel Survey (ATS).171   The 2001 NHTS was 
the source of updated information on annual miles driven by age for passenger cars and light 
trucks.   
 
Finally, it should be noted that the estimates of average annual miles driven by passenger cars and 
light trucks, while new for NHTSA, are based on data collected during 2001-2002, and reflect the 
historically low gasoline prices that prevailed at the time the survey was conducted.  To account for 
the effect on vehicle use of subsequent increases in fuel prices, the estimates of annual vehicle use 
derived from the NHTS are adjusted to reflect projected future gasoline prices using the rebound 
effect, which is discussed in detail later in this chapter.  Two factors affect the cost of gasoline per 
mile driven - fuel prices per gallon, and fuel economy in miles-per-gallon.  Because the intensity of 
vehicle use depends partly on the cost per mile of driving, the estimates of vehicle use developed from 
NHTS data reflect both fuel prices and fuel economy levels that prevailed during 2001 and 2002, when 
the survey was conducted.  In analyzing the final rule, the agency adjusted the annual usage estimates 
derived from the NHTS data to reflect the effect of the higher EIA fuel prices that are forecast over the 
covered vehicles’ expected lifetimes, which exceed those that existed during 2001-2002. 
 
Specifically, the adjustment accounted for the difference between the average price per gallon of fuel 
forecast over the expected lifetimes of model year 2011-2015 passenger cars and light trucks and the 
average price that prevailed during 2000 and 2001.  When expressed in percentage terms, this 
difference was assumed to represent the percent increase in fuel cost per mile driven between the time 
the survey was conducted and the time period when model year 2011-2015 passenger cars and light 
trucks would be in service.  
 
The same elasticity of annual vehicle use with respect to fuel cost per mile that was used to estimate 
the increase in vehicle use resulting from improved fuel economy (see detailed discussion of the 
“rebound effect” earlier in this chapter), assumed to be –0.15, was applied to this percent difference to 
adjust the estimates of vehicle use derived from the survey to reflect the effect of higher future fuel 
prices.  In contrast, this adjustment reduces model year 2011-2015 passenger cars’ and light trucks’ 
average annual usage at each age to account for the fact that fuel cost per mile driven is expected to be

higher throughout their expected lifetimes than at the time the NHTS was conducted.  The results of 
this adjustment are shown in Table VIII-2c for passenger cars and in Table VIII-2d for light trucks. 
The unadjusted average lifetime mileage is estimated to be 161,847 for passenger cars and 190,066 for 
light trucks.  After adjusting for the rebound effect, the average lifetime mileage is estimated to be 
152,274 for passenger cars and 178,824 for light trucks.

In interpreting the survivability and annual mileage estimates reported in Tables VIII-2a through 
VIII-2d, it is important to understand that vehicles are considered to be of age 1 during the 
calendar year that coincides with their model year   Thus for example, model year 2010 vehicles 
will be considered to be of age 1 during calendar year 2010.  This convention is used in order to 
account for the fact that vehicles produced during a model year typical are first offered for sale in 
June through September of the preceding calendar year (for example, sales of a model year 
typically begin in June through September of the previous calendar year, depending on 
manufacturer).  Thus virtually all of the vehicles produced during a model year will be in use for 
some or all of the calendar year coinciding with their model year, and they are considered to be 
of age 1 during that year.172  As an illustration, virtually the entire production of model year 2008 
vehicles will have been sold and placed in service by the end of calendar year 2008, so model 
year 2008 vehicles are defined to be of age 1 during calendar year 2008.Model year 2008 
vehicles are subsequently defined to be of age 2 during calendar year 2009, age 3 during 
calendar year 2010, and so on, until they reach their maximum age of 36 years in calendar year 
2043 (2008 + 35 = 2043).  
 
To determine the impact of improved CAFE standards, fuel consumption is calculated using both 
current and revised CAFE levels.  The difference between these estimates represents the net 
savings from increased CAFE standards. With the current CAFE standard assumed to remain in 
effect, total fuel consumption by each model year’s vehicles during each calendar year they 
remain in service is calculated by dividing the total number of miles they are driven during that 
year by the average on-road fuel economy level they would achieve under the higher of either the 
manufacturer-specific standard or their production plans.  With the final rule in effect, total fuel 
consumption by each model year’s vehicles during each future calendar year is calculated by 
dividing the total number of miles they are driven by the higher on-road fuel economy level 
associated with that stricter CAFE standard.  The total number of miles that vehicles are driven 
each year is different under the final rule than with the current standards remaining in effect as a 
result of the fuel economy “rebound effect,” which is discussed in detail later in this chapter.  
 
The economic benefits to vehicle owners that result from future fuel savings are valued in this 
analysis over the complete expected lifetimes of the vehicles affected by the final rule.  This 
reflects the assumption that while the purchaser and first owner of a new vehicle might not 
realize the full lifetime benefits of improved fuel economy, subsequent owners of that same 
vehicle will continue to experience the resulting fuel savings until the vehicle is retired from 
service.  It is important to note, however, that not all vehicles produced during a model year 
remain in service for the complete lifetime (26-year for passenger cars or 36 –year for light 
trucks) of each model year assumed in this analysis.  Due to the pattern of vehicle retirement 
over this period, the expected or average lifetime of a representative vehicle is approximately 
half of that figure.   
 
CAFE’s most immediate impacts are on individual consumers, but regulating fuel economy also 
has a broader societal impact that must be considered.  The agency believes that CAFE standards 
should reflect the true economic value of resources that are saved when less fuel is produced and 
                                                 
172 One complication arises because registration data are typically collected for July 1 of each calendar year, so not 
all vehicles produced during a model year will appear in registration data until the calendar year when they have 
reached age 2 (and sometimes age 3) under this convention.  
  
VIII-18
consumed, higher vehicle prices, and, to the extent possible, any externalities that impact the 
broader society.  Consumers’ perceptions of these values may differ from their actual impacts, 
but they will nonetheless experience the full value of actual fuel savings just as they will pay the 
full increased cost when the vehicle is purchased.   
 
Moreover, the first and any subsequent owners of a vehicle will together realize these savings 
throughout its entire on-road lifetime.  While a vehicle’s buyer may only experience fuel savings 
for the limited time he or she typically owns that vehicle, any subsequent purchasers and owners 
of that used vehicle will continue to experience the fuel savings resulting from its higher fuel 
economy throughout the remainder of its useful life.  The agency restricts its analysis of the sales 
impacts of higher new vehicle prices to the length of time the buyers of new vehicles typically 
own the vehicles they purchase, under the assumption that their purchase decisions will be 
influenced only by the benefits they receive during the time they expect to own the vehicles they 
purchase new.  The agency estimates the length of this period using the average term of new car 
loans, which has recently averaged almost exactly 5 years.173  However, the agency believes that 
the value of fuel savings resulting from more efficient operation over the entire lifetime of 
vehicles should be reflected in its analysis of the societal impacts that will determine fuel 
economy standards.        
 
The economic value of fuel savings resulting from the final rule is estimated by applying the 
forecast of future fuel prices from the Reference Case of the Energy Information 
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2008 Early Release  to each future year’s estimated 
fuel savings.174  (The uncertainty analysis reported in Chapter X uses fuel price forecasts from 
the High and Low Oil Price Scenarios included in AEO 2007 to examine the effects a range of 
possible fuel price scenarios, since High and Low Oil Price Scenario forecasts for AEO 2008 
were not available at the time this analysis was conducted.)  The AEO 2008 Early Release  
forecast of future fuel prices, which is reported in Table VIII-3, represents retail prices per gallon 
of fuel, which including Federal, State, and any applicable local taxes.  While the retail price of 
fuel is the proper measure for valuing fuel savings from the perspective of vehicle owners, two 
adjustments to the retail price are necessary in order to reflect the economic value of fuel savings 
to society as a whole.   
 
First, Federal and State taxes are excluded from the social value of fuel savings because these do 
not reflect costs of resources used in fuel production, and thus do not reflect resource savings 
that would result from reducing fuel consumption.  Instead, fuel taxes simply represent resources 
that are transferred from one segment of the population to another.  Any reduction in State and 
Federal fuel tax payments by consumers will reduce government revenues by the same amount, 
thus ultimately reducing the value of government-financed services by approximately that same 
amount.  The benefit derived from lower taxes to individuals is thus likely to be offset exactly by 
a reduction in the value of services provided to society.

Second, the economic cost of externalities generated by imports and consumption of petroleum 
products will be reduced in proportion to gasoline savings resulting from the final rule.  The 
estimated economic value of these externalities is converted into its per-gallon equivalent and 
added to the pre-tax price of gasoline in order to measure this additional benefit to society for 
each gallon of fuel saved.  This also allows the magnitude of these externalities to be easily 
compared to the value of the resources saved from reduced fuel production and use, which 
represents the most important component of the social benefits from saving gasoline.   A 
discussion of these externality values is included in the next section of this chapter 
 
Table VIII-3 illustrates the adjustment of forecast retail fuel prices to remove the value of fuel 
taxes and add the value of economic externalities from petroleum imports and use.  The 
derivation of the estimated value of reduced economic externalities from petroleum use shown in 
the table is explained in detail in the following section.  While the Reference Case fuel price 
forecasts reported in AEO 2008 Early Release extend through 2030, the agency’s analysis of the 
value of fuel savings over the 26-year maximum lifetimes of MY 2011-15 passenger cars and 
36-year maximum lifetimes MY 2011-15 light trucks requires forecasts extending through 
calendar year 2050.  The agency assumes that retail fuel prices will remain at the 2030 forecast 
values reported in the AEO 2008 Reference Case forecast over the period from 2030 through 
2052 (in constant-dollar terms).   As Table VIII-3 shows, the projected retail price of gasoline 
expressed in 2006 dollars varies over the forecast period, declining from $2.69 in 2008 to $2.20 
in 2016, and then increasing to $2.49 by 2030 and as assumed previously, remaining at that level 
through 2052.   
 
Since gasoline taxes are a transfer payment and not a societal cost, the value of gasoline taxes is 
subtracted from the estimated gasoline price to estimate the value to society of saving gasoline.  
The agency has updated its estimates of gasoline taxes, using updated State tax rates reported for 
January 1, 2006.  Expressed in 2006 dollars, Federal gasoline taxes are currently $0.172, while 
State and local gasoline taxes together average $0.262 per gallon, for a total tax burden of $0.434 
per gallon.   
 
Following the assumptions used by EIA in its National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), state 
and local gasoline taxes are assumed to keep pace with inflation in nominal terms, and thus to 
remain constant when expressed in constant 2006 dollars.  In contrast, federal gasoline taxes are 
assumed to remain unchanged in nominal terms, and thus to decline throughout the forecast 
period when expressed in constant 2006 dollars.  These differing assumptions about  the likely 
future behavior of federal and state/local fuel taxes are consistent with recent historical 
experience, and reflect the fact that Federal motor fuel taxes and most State taxes are specified 
on a cents-per-gallon basis (some State taxes are levied as a percentage of the wholesale price of 
fuel), and typically require legislation to change.   
    
Actual fuel economy levels achieved by light-duty vehicles in on-road driving fall somewhat 
short of their levels measured under the laboratory-like test conditions used by EPA to establish 
its published fuel economy ratings for different models.  In analyzing the fuel savings from 
alternative CAFE standards, NHTSA has previously adjusted the actual fuel economy 
performance of each light truck model downward from its rated value to reflect the expected size 
of this on-road fuel economy “gap.”  On December 27, 2006, EPA adopted changes to its 
  
VIII-20
regulations on fuel economy labeling, which were intended to bring vehicles’ rated fuel economy 
levels closer to their actual on-road fuel economy levels.175 
 
In its Final Rule, EPA estimated that actual on-road fuel economy for light-duty vehicles 
averages 20 percent lower than published fuel economy levels.  For example, if the overall EPA 
fuel economy rating of a light truck is 20 mpg, the on-road fuel economy actually achieved by a 
typical driver of that vehicle is expected to be 16 mpg (20*.80).  NHTSA has employed EPA’s 
revised estimate of this on-road fuel economy gap in this analysis of the fuel savings resulting 
from alternative CAFE standards proposed in this rulemaking.

Other Economic Benefits from Reducing Petroleum Use 
The agency believes that assessing the economic case for increasing the stringency of fuel 
economy standards requires a comprehensive analysis of the resulting benefits and costs to the 
U.S economy, rather than simply comparing the direct costs associated with petroleum use and 
fuel production to current fuel taxes.  The benefits of more stringent fuel economy standards 
include the market value of the savings in resources from producing less fuel, together with the 
resulting reductions in the costs of economic externalities associated with petroleum 
consumption, and of environmental externalities caused by fuel consumption and production.  
Environmental externalities include adverse health impacts associated with criteria pollutants and 
environmental damage associated with greenhouse gases.  The costs imposed on the U.S. 
economy by more stringent fuel economy regulation include those costs for manufacturing more 
fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as the increased external costs of congestion, crashes, noise and 
pollution from added driving caused by the rebound effect.   
 
Vehicle buyers value improved fuel economy using retail fuel prices and miles per gallon, but 
may consider fuel savings only over the time they expect to own a vehicle, while the value to the 
U.S. economy of saving fuel is measured by its pre-tax price, and includes fuel savings over the 
entire lifetime of vehicles.  Thus, it cannot simply be assumed that the interaction of 
manufacturers’ costs and vehicle buyers’ demands in the private marketplace will determine 
optimal fuel economy levels, and that these levels should only be adjusted by Federal regulation 
if the external costs of fuel production and use exceed current fuel taxes.  
 
The Agency’s analysis estimates the value of each category of benefits and costs separately, and 
it compares the total benefits resulting from each alternative level to its total costs in order to 
assess its desirability.  This more complete accounting of benefits and costs to the U.S. economy 
from reducing fuel use is necessary to assess the case for fuel economy regulation generally, and 
for increasing the stringency of the current passenger car and light truck fuel economy standards 
in particular.  
 
U.S. consumption and imports of petroleum products also impose costs on the domestic 
economy that are not reflected in the market price for crude petroleum, or in the prices paid by 
consumers of petroleum products such as gasoline.  These costs include (1) higher prices for 
petroleum products resulting from the effect of U.S. oil import demand on the world oil price; (2) 
the risk of disruptions to the U.S. economy caused by sudden reductions in the supply of 
imported oil to the U.S.; and (3) expenses for maintaining a U.S. military presence to secure 
imported oil supplies from unstable regions, and for maintaining the strategic petroleum reserve 
(SPR) to cushion against resulting price increases.  Higher U.S. imports of crude oil or refined 
petroleum products raise the magnitude of these external economic costs, thus increasing the true 
economic cost of supplying transportation fuels above the resource costs of producing them.  
Conversely, reducing U.S. imports of crude petroleum or refined fuels or reducing fuel 
consumption can reduce these external costs.  Any reduction in their total value that results from 
improved vehicle fuel economy represents an economic benefit of  raising fuel economy 
standards in addition to the value of fuel savings and emissions reductions itself.   
  
VIII-22
 
Demand Costs 
Increased U.S. oil imports can impose higher costs on all purchasers of petroleum products, 
because the U.S. is a sufficiently large purchaser of foreign oil supplies that changes in U.S. 
demand can affect the world price.  The effect of U.S. petroleum imports on world oil prices is 
determined by the degree of OPEC monopoly power over global oil supplies, and the degree of 
monopsony power over world oil demand exerted by the U.S.  The combination of these two 
factors means that increases in domestic demand for petroleum products that are met through 
higher oil imports can cause the price of oil in the world market to rise, which imposes economic 
costs on all other purchasers in the global petroleum market in excess of the higher prices paid 
by U.S. consumers.176  Conversely, reducing U.S. oil imports can lower the world petroleum 
price, and thus generate benefits to other oil purchasers by reducing these “monopsony costs.”   
 
Although the degree of current OPEC monopoly power is subject to considerable debate, the 
consensus appears to be that OPEC remains able to exercise some degree of control over the 
response of world oil supplies to variation in world oil prices, so that the world oil market does 
not behave competitively.177    The extent of U.S. monopsony power is determined by a complex 
set of factors including the relative importance of U.S. imports in the world oil market, and the 
sensitivity of petroleum supply and demand to its world price among other participants in the 
international oil market.  Most evidence appears to suggest that variation in U.S. demand for 
imported petroleum continues to exert some influence on world oil prices, although this 
influence appears to be limited.178   
 
In analyzing benefits from its recent actions to increase light truck CAFE standards for model 
years 2005-07 and 2008-11, NHTSA relied on a 1997 study by Oak Ridge National Laboratories 
(ORNL) to estimate the value of reduced economic externalities from petroleum consumption 
and imports.179  More recently, ORNL updated its estimates of the value of these externalities, 
using the analytic framework developed in its original 1997 study in conjunction with recent 
estimates of the variables and parameters that determine their value. 180  These include world oil 
prices, current and anticipated future levels of OPEC petroleum production, U.S. oil import 
                                                 
176 For example, if the U.S. imports 10 million barrels of petroleum per day at a world oil price of $80 per barrel, its 
total daily import bill is $800 million.  If increasing imports to 11 million barrels per day causes the world oil price 
to rise to $81 per barrel, the daily U.S. import bill rises to $891 million.  The resulting increase of $91 million per 
day ($891 minus $800 million) is attributable to increasing daily imports by only 1 million barrels.  This means that 
the incremental cost of importing each additional barrel is $91, or $10 more than the newly-increased world price of 
$81 per barrel.  This additional $10 per barrel represents a cost imposed on all other purchasers in the global 
petroleum market by U.S. buyers, in excess of the price they pay to obtain those additional imports.

levels, the estimated responsiveness of oil supplies and demands to prices in different regions of 
the world, and the likelihood of oil supply disruptions.  ORNL’s prepared its updated estimates 
of oil import externalities were for use by EPA in evaluating the benefits of reductions in U.S. oil 
consumption and imports expected to result from its recently-issued Renewable Fuel Standard 
Rule of 2007 (RFS)181.  
 
The updated ORNL study was subjected to a detailed peer review and its estimates of the value 
of oil import externalities were subsequently revised to reflect their comments and 
recommendations. 182  Specifically, reviewers recommended that ORNL increase its estimates of 
the sensitivity of oil supply by non-OPEC producers and oil demand by nations other than the 
U.S. to changes in the world oil price, as well as reduce its estimate of the sensitivity of U.S. 
gross domestic product (GDP) to potential sudden increases in world oil prices.  After making 
the revisions recommended by peer reviewers, ORNL’s updated estimates of the monopsony 
cost associated with U.S. oil imports range from $5.22 to $9.68 per barrel, with a most likely 
estimate of $7.41 per barrel.  These estimates imply that each gallon of fuel saved as a result of 
adopting higher CAFE standards will reduce the monopsony costs of U.S. oil imports by $0.124 
to $0.230 per gallon, with the actual value most likely to be $0.176 per gallon saved.  This 
represents an economic benefit in addition to the value of savings in fuel production costs that 
would result from improving fuel economy.  
 
Disruption and Adjustment Costs 
The second component of external economic costs imposed by U.S. petroleum imports arises 
partly because an increase in oil prices triggered by a disruption in the supply of imported oil 
reduces the level of output that the U.S. economy can produce.  The reduction in potential U.S. 
economic output depends on the extent and duration of the increases in petroleum product prices 
that result from a disruption in the supply of imported oil, as well as on whether and how rapidly 
these prices return to pre-disruption levels.  Even if prices for imported oil return completely to 
their original levels, however, economic output will be at least temporarily reduced from the 
level that would have been possible without a disruption in oil supplies.  
 
Because supply disruptions and resulting price increases tend to occur suddenly rather than 
gradually, they can also impose costs on businesses and households for adjusting their use of 
petroleum products more rapidly than if the same price increase had occurred gradually over 
time.  These adjustments impose costs because they temporarily reduce economic output even 
below the level that would ultimately be reached once the U.S. economy completely adapted to 
higher petroleum prices.  The additional costs to businesses and households reflect their inability 
to adjust prices, output levels, and their use of energy and other resources quickly and smoothly 
in response to rapid changes in prices for petroleum products. 
 
Since future disruptions in foreign oil supplies are an uncertain prospect, each of these disruption 
costs must be adjusted by the probability that the supply of imported oil to the U.S. will actually 
be disrupted.  The “expected value” of these costs – the product of the probability that an oil 
import disruption will occur and the costs of reduced economic output and abrupt adjustment to

sharply higher petroleum prices – is the appropriate measure of their magnitude.  Any reduction 
in these expected disruption costs resulting from a measure that lowers U.S. oil imports 
represents an additional economic benefit beyond the direct value of savings from reduced 
purchases of petroleum products. 
 
While the vulnerability of the U.S. economy to oil price shocks is widely thought to depend on 
total petroleum consumption rather than on the level of oil imports, variation in imports is still 
likely to have some effect on the magnitude of price increases resulting from a disruption of 
import supply.  In addition, changing the quantity of petroleum imported into the U.S. may also 
affect the probability that such a disruption will occur.  If either the size of the likely price 
increase or the probability that U.S. oil supplies will be disrupted is affected by oil imports, the 
expected value of the costs from a supply disruption will also depend on the level of imports. 
 
Businesses and households use a variety of market mechanisms, including oil futures markets, 
energy conservation measures, and technologies that permit rapid fuel switching to “insure” 
against higher petroleum prices and reduce their costs for adjusting to sudden price increases.  
While the availability of these market mechanisms has likely reduced the potential costs of 
disruptions to the supply of imported oil, consumers of petroleum products are unlikely to take 
account of costs they impose on others, so these costs are probably not reflected in the price of 
imported oil.  Thus changes in oil import levels probably continue to affect the expected cost to 
the U.S. economy from potential oil supply disruptions, although this component of oil import 
costs is likely to be significantly smaller than estimated by studies conducted in the wake of the 
oil supply disruptions during the 1970s. 
 
ORNL’s updated and revised estimates of the increase in the expected costs associated with oil 
supply disruptions to the U.S. and the resulting rapid increase in prices for petroleum products 
amount to $4.54 to $5.84 per barrel, although its most likely estimate of $4.59 per barrel is very 
close to the lower end of this range.  According to these estimates, each gallon of fuel saved will 
reduce the expected costs disruptions to the U.S. economy by $0.108 to $0.139, with the actual 
value most likely to be $0.109 per gallon.  Like the reduction in monopsony costs, the reduction 
in expected disruption costs represents an economic benefit in addition to the value of savings in 
fuel production costs that would result from improving fuel economy.  
 
Military Security and Strategic Petroleum Reserve Costs 
The third component of the external economic costs of importing oil into the U.S. includes 
government outlays for maintaining a military presence to secure the supply of oil imports from 
potentially unstable regions of the world and to protect against their interruption.  Some analysts 
also include outlays for maintaining the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which is 
intended to cushion the U.S. economy against the consequences of disruption in the supply of 
imported oil, as additional costs of protecting the U.S. economy from oil supply disruptions. 
 
NHTSA believes that while costs for U.S. military security may vary over time in response to 
long-term changes in the actual level of oil imports into the U.S., these costs are unlikely to 
decline in response to any reduction in U.S. oil imports resulting from raising future CAFE 
standards for light-duty vehicles.  U.S. military activities in regions that represent vital sources of 
oil imports also serve a broader range of security and foreign policy objectives than simply 
  
VIII-25
protecting oil supplies, and as a consequence are unlikely to vary significantly in response to 
changes in the level of oil imports prompted by higher standards. 
 
Similarly, while the optimal size of the SPR from the standpoint of its potential influence on 
domestic oil prices during a supply disruption may be related to the level of U.S. oil consumption 
and imports, its actual size has not appeared to vary in response to recent changes in oil imports.  
Thus while the budgetary costs for maintaining the Reserve are similar to other external costs in 
that they are not likely to be reflected in the market price for imported oil, these costs do not 
appear to have varied in response to changes in oil import levels. As a result, the agencies’ 
tentative analysis of benefits from alternative CAFE standards does not include cost savings 
from either reduced outlays for U.S. military operations or maintaining a smaller SPR among the 
external benefits of reducing gasoline consumption and petroleum imports by means of 
tightening future standards.  This view concurs with that of the recent ORNL study of economic 
costs from U.S. oil imports, which concludes that savings in government outlays for these 
purposes are unlikely to result form modest reductions in consumption of petroleum products 
and oil imports. 
 
Thus NHTSA has tentatively included only the likely reductions in monopsony and disruption 
costs from lower U.S. petroleum imports in its estimate of the savings in external economic costs 
from reducing fuel consumption.  The updated and revised ORNL estimates suggest that the 
combined reduction in monopsony costs and expected costs to the U.S. economy from oil supply 
disruptions resulting from lower fuel consumption total $0.232 to $0.370 per gallon, with a most 
likely estimate of $0.286 per gallon.  This represents the additional economic benefit likely to 
result from each gallon of fuel saved by higher CAFE standards, beyond the savings in resource 
costs for producing and distributing each gallon of fuel saved.  NHTSA tentatively employs this 
midpoint estimate in its analysis of the benefits from fuel savings projected to result from 
alternative CAFE standards for model years 2011-15.  It also analyzes the effect on these 
benefits estimates from variation in this value over the range from $0.232 to $0.370 per gallon of 
fuel saved. 
 
The Effect of Fuel Savings on Fuel Supply 
Based on a detailed analysis of differences in fuel consumption, petroleum imports, and imports 
of refined petroleum products among the Reference Case, High Economic Growth, and Low 
Economic Growth Scenarios presented in the Energy Information Administration’s Annual 
Energy Outlook 2007, the agency estimates that approximately 50 percent of the reduction in 
fuel consumption resulting from adopting higher CAFE standards is likely to be reflected in 
reduced U.S. imports of refined fuel, while the remaining 50 percent would be expected to be 
reflected in reduced domestic fuel refining.  Of this latter figure, 90 percent is anticipated to 
reduce U.S. imports of crude petroleum for use as a refinery feedstock, while the remaining 10 
percent is expected to reduce U.S. domestic production of crude petroleum.  Thus on balance, 
each gallon of fuel saved as a consequence of higher CAFE standards is anticipated to reduce 
total U.S. imports of crude petroleum or refined fuel by 0.95 gallons.183   
 
                                                 
183 This figure is calculated as 0.50 + 0.50*0.9 = 0.50 + 0.45 = 0.95.

Emissions Reductions Resulting from Fuel Savings 
 
NHTSA has estimated emissions reductions resulting from fuel savings for purposes of this 
PRIA.  However, as indicated previously, NHTSA will consider the potential environmental 
impacts of the proposed standards and reasonable alternatives for purposes of NEPA through the 
NEPA process. 
 
Criteria Pollutants 
While reductions in domestic fuel refining and distribution that result from lower fuel 
consumption will reduce emissions of criteria pollutants, additional vehicle use associated with 
the rebound effect of higher fuel economy will increase emissions of these pollutants (see 
detailed discussion of the Rebound Effect earlier in this chapter).  The net effect of stricter 
standards depends on the relative magnitudes of reduced emissions in fuel refining and 
distribution, and increased emissions from vehicle use.  Because the relationship between 
emission rates (emissions per gallon refined of fuel or mile driven) from fuel refining and vehicle 
use differs for each specific criteria pollutant, the net effect of fuel savings from the proposed 
standards on total emissions of each pollutant is likely to differ.  Predominant criteria pollutants 
emitted in fuel production and use include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon compounds 
(usually referred to as “volatile organic compounds,” or VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine 
particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).  
 
For purposes of NHTSA’s PRIA, the increase in emissions of these pollutants from additional 
vehicle use due to the rebound effect is tentatively estimated by multiplying the increase in total 
miles driven by vehicles of each model year and age during future calendar years by age-specific 
emission rates per vehicle-mile for each pollutant.  The agencies developed these emission rates 
using EPA’s MOBILE6.2 motor vehicle emissions factor model, with updated vehicle emission 
factors for some pollutants.184   Emissions of these pollutants also occur during crude oil 
extraction and transportation, gasoline refining, and gasoline storage and distribution.  The 
reduction in total emissions from each of these sources thus depends on the extent to which fuel 
savings result in lower imports of refined gasoline, or in reduced domestic gasoline refining.185 
 
Based on analysis of changes in U.S. gasoline imports and domestic gasoline consumption 
forecast in AEO 2007, NHTSA tentatively estimates that 50 percent of fuel savings resulting 
from higher CAFE standards will result in reduced imports of refined gasoline, while the 
remaining 50 percent will reduce domestic refining.186  The reduction in domestic refining is 
assumed to leave its sources of crude petroleum unchanged from the mix of 90 percent imports 
and 10 percent domestic production projected by AEO 2007.

http://www.epa.gov/otaq/m6.htm#m60 (last accessed Sept. 10, 2007). 
185 To a lesser extent, they also depend on whether any reduction in domestic gasoline refining is translated into 
reduced imports of crude oil or reduced domestic extraction of petroleum.  
186 Estimates of the response of gasoline imports and domestic refining to fuel savings from stricter standards are 
variable and highly uncertain, but our preliminary analysis indicates that under any reasonable assumption about 
these responses, the magnitude of the net change in criteria pollutant emissions (accounting for both the rebound 
effect and changes in refining emissions) is extremely low relative to their current total. 
  
VIII-27
NHTSA proposes to estimate reductions in criteria pollutant emissions from gasoline refining 
and distribution using emission rates obtained from Argonne National Laboratories’ Greenhouse 
Gases and Regulated Emissions in Transportation (GREET) model.187  The GREET model 
provides separate estimates of air pollutant emissions that occur in four phases of fuel production 
and distribution: crude oil extraction, crude oil transportation and storage, fuel refining, and fuel 
distribution and storage.188   We tentatively assume that reductions in imports of refined fuel 
would reduce criteria pollutant emissions during fuel storage and distribution only.  Reductions 
in domestic fuel refining using imported crude oil as a feedstock are tentatively assumed to 
reduce emissions during crude oil transportation and storage, as well as during gasoline refining, 
distribution, and storage, simply because less of it would be occurring.  Similarly, reduced 
domestic fuel refining using domestically-produced crude oil is tentatively assumed to reduce 
emissions during all phases of gasoline production and distribution.189 
 
The net changes in emissions of each criteria pollutant are calculated by comparing the increases 
in their emissions that result from increased vehicle use to the reductions that result from lower 
domestic fuel refining and distribution.  The net change in emissions of each criteria pollutant is 
converted to an economic value using estimates of the economic costs per ton emitted (which 
result primarily from damages to human health) developed by EPA and submitted to the federal 
Office of Management and Budget for review.  For certain criteria pollutants, EPA estimates 
different per-ton costs for increases in emissions from vehicle use than for reductions in 
emissions from fuel refining, reflecting differences in their typical geographic distributions, 
contributions to ambient pollution levels, and resulting population exposure.  The per unit costs 
for each criteria pollutant is summarized in Table VIII-B. 
 
Greenhouse Gases 
NHTSA has taken the economic benefits of reducing CO2 emission into account in this 
rulemaking, both in developing proposed CAFE standards and in assessing the economic 
benefits of each alternative that was considered.  As noted above, the 9th Circuit found in CBD 
that NHTSA had been arbitrary and capricious in deciding not to monetize the benefit of 
reducing CO2 emissions, saying that the agency had not substantiated the conclusion in its April 
2006 final rule that the appropriate course was not to monetize (i.e., quantify the value of) carbon 
emissions reduction at all.   
 
To this end, NHTSA reviewed published estimates of the “social cost of carbon emissions” 
(SCC).  The SCC refers to the marginal cost of additional damages caused by the increase in 
expected climate impacts resulting from the emission of each additional metric ton of carbon, 
                                                 
187 Argonne National Laboratories, The Greenhouse Gas and Regulated Emissions from Transportation (GREET) 
Model, Version 1.6, April 2005, available at http://www.transportation.anl.gov/software/GREET/index.html (last 
accessed Sept. 10, 2007). 
188 Emissions that occur during vehicle refueling at retail gasoline stations (primarily evaporative emissions of 
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) are already accounted for in the “tailpipe” emission factors used to estimate 
the emissions generated by increased light truck use.  GREET estimates emissions in each phase of gasoline 
production and distribution in mass per unit of gasoline energy content; these factors are then converted to mass per 
gallon of gasoline using the average energy content of gasoline. 
189 In effect, this assumes that the distances crude oil travels to U.S. refineries are approximately the same regardless 
of whether it travels from domestic oilfields or import terminals, and that the distances that gasoline travels from 
refineries to retail stations are approximately the same as those from import terminals to gasoline stations.   
  
VIII-28
which is emitted in the form of CO2.190  It is typically estimated as the net present value of the 
impact over some time period (100 years or longer) of one additional ton of carbon emitted into 
the atmosphere.  Because accumulated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and 
the projected impacts on global climate are increasing over time, the economic damages resulting 
from each additional ton of CO2 emissions in future years are believed to be greater as a result.  
Thus estimates of the SCC are typically reported for a specific year, and these estimates are 
generally larger for emissions in more distant future years.   
 
There is substantial variation among different authors’ estimates of the SCC, much of which can 
be traced to differences in their underlying assumptions about several variables.  These include 
the sensitivity of global temperatures and other climate attributes to increasing atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, discount rates applied to future economic damages from 
climate change, whether damages sustained by developing regions of the globe should be 
weighted more heavily than damages to developed nations, how long climate changes persist 
once they occur, and the economic valuation of specific climate impacts.191   
 
Taken as a whole, recent estimates of the SCC may underestimate the true damage costs of 
carbon emissions because they often exclude damages caused by extreme weather events or 
climate response scenarios with low probabilities but potentially extreme impacts, and may 
underestimate the climate impacts and damages that could result from multiple stresses on the 
global climatic system.  At the same time, however, many studies fail to consider potentially 
beneficial impacts of climate change, and do not adequately account for how future development 
patterns and adaptations could reduce potential impacts from climate change or the economic 
damages they cause. 
 
Given the uncertainty surrounding estimates of the SCC, the use of any single study may not be 
advisable since its estimate of the SCC will depend on many assumptions made by its authors.  
The Working Group II’s contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report of the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)192 notes that:  
The large ranges of SCC are due in the large part to differences in assumptions 
regarding climate sensitivity, response lags, the treatment of risk and equity, 
economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic 
losses, and discount rates. 
 Although the IPCC does not recommend a single estimate of the SCC, it does cite the Tol 
(2005) study on four separate occasions (pages 17, 65, 813, 822) as the only available survey of 
the peer-reviewed literature that has itself been subjected to peer review.  Tol developed a 
                                                 
190 Carbon itself accounts for 12/44, or about 27%, of the mass of carbon dioxide (12/44 is the ratio of the molecular 
weight of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).  Thus each ton of carbon emitted is associated with 44/12, or 3.67, tons 
of carbon dioxide emissions.  Estimates of the SCC are typically reported in dollars per ton of carbon, and must be 
divided by 3.67 to determine their equivalent value per ton of carbon dioxide emissions.

VIII-29
probability function using the SCC estimates of the peer reviewed literature and found estimates 
ranging from less than zero to over $200 per metric ton of carbon.  In an effort to resolve some 
of the uncertainty in reported estimates of climate damage costs from carbon emissions, Tol 
(2005) reviewed and summarized one hundred and three estimates of the SCC from 28 published 
studies.  He  concluded that when only peer-reviewed studies published in recognized journals 
are considered, “…climate change impacts may be very uncertain but is unlikely that the 
marginal damage costs of carbon dioxide emissions exceed $50 per [metric] ton carbon [about 
$14 per metric ton of CO2].” 193  He also concluded that the costs may be less than $14.   
 
Because of the number of assumptions required by each study, the wide range of uncertainty 
surrounding these assumptions, and their critical influence on the resulting estimates of climate 
damage costs, some studies have undoubtedly produced estimates of the SCC that are 
unrealistically high, while others are likely to have estimated values that are improbably low.  
Using a value for the SCC that reflects the central tendency of estimates drawn from many 
studies reduces the chances of relying on a single estimate that subsequently proves to be biased.  
 
It is important to note that estimates of the SCC almost invariably include the value of worldwide 
damages from potential climate impacts caused by carbon dioxide emissions, and are not 
confined to damages likely to be suffered within the U.S.  In contrast, the other estimates of costs 
and benefits of increasing fuel economy included in this proposal include only the economic 
values of impacts that occur within the U.S.  For example, the economic value of reducing 
criteria air pollutant emissions from overseas oil refineries is not counted as a benefit resulting 
from this rule, because any reduction in damages to health and property caused by overseas 
emissions are unlikely to be experienced within the U.S. 
 
In contrast, the reduced value of transfer payments from U.S. oil purchasers to foreign oil 
suppliers that results when lower U.S. oil demand reduces the world price of petroleum (the 
reduced “monopsony effect”)  is counted as a benefit of reducing fuel use.194   If the agency’s 
analysis was conducted from a worldwide rather than a U.S. perspective, however, the benefit 
from reducing air pollution overseas would be included, while reduced payments from U.S. oil 
consumers to foreign suppliers would not.   
 
In order to be consistent with NHTSA’s use of exclusively domestic costs and benefits in prior 
CAFE rulemakings, the appropriate value to be placed on changes climate damages caused by 
carbon emissions should be one that reflects the change in damages to the United States alone.  
Accordingly, NHTSA notes that the value for the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions might be 
restricted to the fraction of those benefits that are likely to be experienced within the United 
States.   
 
Although no estimates of benefits to the U.S. itself that are likely to result from reducing CO2 
emissions are currently available, NHTSA expects that if such values were developed, the

194  The reduction in payments from U.S. oil purchasers to domestic petroleum producers is not included as a benefit, 
since it represents a transfer that occurs entirely within the U.S. economy. 
  
VIII-30
agency would employ those rather than global benefit estimates in its analysis.  NHTSA also 
anticipates that if such values were developed, they would be lower than comparable global 
values, since the U.S. is likely to sustain only a fraction of total global damages resulting from 
climate change.  
         
In the meantime, the agency has elected to use the IPCC estimate of $43 per metric ton of carbon 
as an upper bound on the benefits resulting from reducing each metric ton of U.S. emissions. 195  
This corresponds to approximately $12 per metric ton of CO2 when expressed in 2006 dollars.  
This estimate is based on the 2005 Tol study.196  The Tol study is cited repeatedly as an 
authoritative survey in various IPCC reports, which are widely accepted as representing the 
general consensus in the scientific community on climate change science.  Since the IPCC 
estimate includes the worldwide costs of potential damages from carbon dioxide emissions, 
NHTSA has elected to employ it as an upper bound on the estimated value of the reduction in 
U.S. domestic damage costs that is likely to result from lower CO2 emissions.197   
 
The IPCC Working Group II Fourth Assessment Report (2007, p. 822) further suggests that the 
SCC of carbon is growing at an annual 2.4 percent growth rate, based on estimated increases in 
damages from future emissions reported in published studies.  NHTSA has also elected to apply 
this growth rate to Tol’s original 2005 estimate.  Thus by 2011, the agency estimates that the 
upper bound on the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions will have reached about $14 per metric 
ton of CO2, and will continue increase by 2.4 percent annually thereafter.   
 
In setting a lower bound, the agency agrees with the IPCC Working Group II (2007) report that 
“significant warming across the globe and the locations of significant observed changes in many 
systems consistent with warming is very unlikely to be due solely to natural variability of 
temperatures or natural variability of the systems” (pp. 9).  Although this finding suggests that 
the global value of economic benefits from reducing carbon dioxide emissions is unlikely to be 
zero, it does not necessarily rule out low or zero values for the benefit to the U.S. itself from 
reducing emissions.  
 
For most of the analysis it performed to develop this proposal, NHTSA required a single estimate 
for the value of reducing CO2 emissions.  The agency thus elected to use the midpoint of the 
range from $0 to $14 (or $7.00) per metric ton of CO2 as the initial value for the year 2011, and 
assumed that this value would grow at 2.4 percent annually thereafter.  This estimate is 
employed for the analyses conducted using the Volpe CAFE model to support development of 
the proposed standards.  The agency also conducted sensitivity analyses of the benefits from 
                                                 
195  The estimate of $43 per ton of carbon emissions is reported by Tol (p. 2070) as the mean of the “best” estimates 
reported in peer-reviewed studies (see fn. 4).  It thus differs from the mean of all estimates reported in the peer-
reviewed studies surveyed by Tol.  The $43 per ton value is also attributed to Tol by IPCC Working Group II 
(2007), p. 822. 
196  Tol’s more recent (2007) and inclusive survey has been published online with peer-review comments.  The 
agency has elected not to rely on the estimates it reports, but will consider doing so in its analysis of the final rule if 
the survey has been published, and will also consider any other newly-published evidence.  
197  For purposes of comparison, we note that in the rulemaking to establish CAFE standards for MY 2008-11 light 
trucks, NRDC recommended a value of $10 to $25 per ton of CO2 emissions reduced by fuel savings and both 
Environmental Defense and Union of Concerned Scientists recommended a value of $50 per ton of carbon 
(equivalent to about $14 per ton of CO2 emissions).

reducing CO2 emissions using both the upper ($14 per metric ton) and lower ($0 per metric ton) 
bounds of this range.   
 
NHTSA seeks comment on its tentative conclusions for the value of the SCC, the use of a 
domestic versus global value for the economic benefit of reducing CO2 emissions, the rate at 
which the value of the SCC grows over time, the desirability of and procedures for incorporating 
benefits from reducing emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2, and any other aspects of 
developing a reliable SCC value for purposes of establishing CAFE standards. 
 
 
Consumer Benefits from Additional Driving 
The increase in travel associated with the rebound effect produces additional benefits to vehicle 
owners, which reflect the value to drivers and other vehicle occupants of the added (or more 
desirable) social and economic opportunities that become accessible with additional travel.  As 
evidenced by the fact that they elect to make more frequent or longer trips when the cost of 
driving declines, the benefits from this added travel are at least as large as drivers’ added costs 
for the fuel it consumes (measured at the improved level of fuel economy resulting from stricter 
CAFE standards).198   The benefits from additional rebound effect travel also include the 
consumer surplus received by vehicle buyers who value the opportunities that increased travel 
makes available to them at more than the fuel cost of the additional driving.  Because it depends 
on the improvement in fuel economy, the value of benefits from increased vehicle use changes 
by model year and alternative CAFE standard, and is shown in Tables VIII-5 through VIII-9.   
 
Added Costs from Congestion, Crashes, and Noise 
While it provides some benefits to drivers, increased vehicle use associated with the fuel 
economy rebound effect can also contribute to increased traffic congestion, motor vehicle 
crashes, and highway noise.  Additional vehicle use can contribute to traffic congestion and 
delays by increasing recurring congestion on heavily-traveled roadways during peak travel 
periods, depending on how the additional travel is distributed over the day and on where it 
occurs.  By increasing the number of crashes and disabled vehicles, added driving can also 
increase the delays that often result from these incidents, although the extent to which it actually 
does so again depends on when and where the added travel occurs.  In either case, any added 
delays impose higher costs on drivers and other vehicle occupants in the form of increased travel 
time and operating expenses, and these should be considered as an additional economic cost 
associated with the rebound effect.  Because drivers do not take these added costs into account in 
deciding when to make trips or where they travel, they must be accounted for separately as a cost 
of the added driving associated with the rebound effect. 
 
Increased passenger car and light truck use due to the rebound effect may also increase the costs 
associated with traffic crashes.  Drivers presumably take account of the potential costs they (and 
the other occupants of their vehicles) face from the possibility of being involved in a crash when 
they decide to make additional trips.  However, they probably do not consider all of the potential 
costs they impose on occupants of other vehicles and on pedestrians when crashes occur, so any 
increase in these “external” crash costs must be considered as another cost of additional rebound-
effect driving.  Like increased delay costs, any increase in these external crash costs caused by 
                                                 
198 These benefits are included in the value of fuel savings reported in Tables VIII-5 through VIII-9. 
  
VIII-32
added driving is likely to depend on the traffic conditions under which it takes place, since 
crashes are more frequent in heavier traffic, but their severity may be reduced by the slower 
speeds at which heavier traffic typically moves.  Thus estimates of the increase in external crash 
costs from the rebound effect also need to account for when and where the added driving occurs.  
 
Finally, added vehicle use from the rebound effect may also increase traffic noise.  Noise 
generated by vehicles causes inconvenience, irritation, and potentially even discomfort to 
occupants of other vehicles, to pedestrians and other bystanders, and to residents or occupants of 
surrounding property.  Because none of these effects are likely to be taken into account by the 
drivers whose vehicles contribute to traffic noise, they represent additional externalities 
associated with motor vehicle use.  Although there is considerable uncertainty in estimating its 
value, the added inconvenience and irritation caused by increased traffic noise imposes economic 
costs on those it affects, and these added costs are unlikely to be taken into account by drivers of 
the vehicles that cause it.  Thus any increase in noise costs resulting from added vehicle use must 
be included together with other increased external costs from the rebound effect.  
 
Our analysis uses estimates of the congestion costs, crash costs, and noise costs for pickup trucks 
and vans developed by the Federal Highway Administration to estimate the increased external 
costs caused by added light truck use from the rebound effect.199  These estimates are intended to 
measure the increases in external costs – that is, the marginal external costs – from added 
congestion, property damages and injuries in traffic crashes, and noise levels caused by 
additional usage of light trucks that are borne by persons other than their drivers.  FHWA’s 
“Middle” estimates for congestion, crash, and noise costs imposed by passenger cars are 5.22 
cents, 2.26 cents and 0.07 cents per vehicle mile when expressed in 2006 dollars.200  For pickup 
trucks and vans these costs are 4.66 cents, 2.51 cents, and 0.07 cents per vehicle-mile.  These 
costs are multiplied by the estimated increases in passenger car and light truck use from the 
rebound effect during each year of the affected model years’ lifetimes in the fleet to yield the 
estimated increases in congestion, crash, and noise externality costs during that year.   The 
resulting estimates are discounted to their present values as of the date each model year is sold 
and summed to obtain their total values.  
 
The Federal Highway Administration’s estimates of these costs agree closely with some other 
recent estimates.  For example, recent published research conducted by Resources for the Future 
(RFF) estimates marginal congestion and external crash costs for increased light-duty vehicle use 
in the U.S. to be 3.9 and 3.4 cents per vehicle-mile when converted to 2006 dollars.201  These 
estimates incorporate careful adjustments of congestion and crash costs that are intended to 
reflect the traffic conditions under which additional driving is likely to take place, as well as its 
likely effects on both the frequency and severity of motor vehicle crashes.   
                                                 
199 These estimates were developed by FHWA for use in its 1997 Federal Highway Cost Allocation Study.

Costs from Increased Air Pollutant Emissions  
Finally, as noted previously under Emissions Reductions Resulting from Fuel Savings, additional 
passenger car and light truck use associated with the rebound effect will increase emissions of air 
pollutants that occur as motor vehicles are driven.  Predominant air pollutants emitted by motor 
vehicles include hydrocarbon compounds (usually referred to as “volatile organic compounds,” 
or VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).  The 
increased use of passenger cars and light trucks that occurs through the rebound effect causes 
higher emissions of these “criteria” pollutants, since Federal standards limit their permissible 
emissions by motor vehicles on a per-mile basis.  The increase in emissions of these pollutants 
from additional vehicle use is estimated by multiplying the increase in total miles driven by 
vehicles of each model year and age during a calendar year by age-specific emission rates per 
vehicle-mile developed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s MOBILE6.2 motor 
vehicle emissions factor model202.  The monetized value of changes in criteria pollutant emissions 
(fine PM, NOx, SO2, VOCs andCO) are derived from EPA estimates of the value of health and welfare-
related damages (incurred or avoided). These estimates, expressed as dollars per ton, are based on the 
benefits associated with recently-adopted regulations that limit emissions of air pollutants from mobile 
sources, a category that includes passenger cars, light trucks, and other highway vehicles.203  
 
The Value of Increased Driving Range 
 Improving the fuel economy of passenger cars and light-duty trucks may also increase their 
driving range before they require refueling.  By reducing the frequency with which drivers 
typically refuel their vehicles, and by extending the upper limit of the range they can travel 
before requiring refueling, improving fuel economy thus provides some additional benefits to 
their owners.  (Alternatively, if manufacturers respond to improved fuel economy by reducing 
the size of fuel tanks to maintain a constant driving range, the resulting cost saving will 
presumably be reflected in lower vehicle sales prices.)   
 
No direct estimates of the value of extended vehicle range are readily available, so the agency’s 
analysis calculates the reduction in the annual number of required refueling cycles that results 
from improved fuel economy, and applies DOT-recommended values of travel time savings to 
convert the resulting time savings to their economic value.204  As an illustration of how the value 
of extended refueling range is estimated, a typical small light truck model has an average fuel 
tank size of approximately 20 gallons.  Assuming that drivers typically refuel when their tanks 
are 20 percent full (i.e., 4 gallons in reserve), increasing this model’s actual on-road fuel 
economy from 24 to 25 mpg would extend its driving range from 384 miles (= 16 gallons x 24 
mpg) to 400 miles (= 16 gallons x 25 mpg).  Assuming that it is driven 12,000 miles/year, this 
reduces the number of times it needs to be refueled each year from 31.3 (= 12,000 miles per year 
/ 384 miles per refueling) to 30.0 (= 12,000 miles per year / 400 miles per refueling), or by 1.3 
refuelings per year.

Weighted by the nationwide mix of urban (about 2/3) and rural (about 1/3) driving and average 
vehicle occupancy for all driving trips (1.6 persons), the DOT-recommended value of travel time 
per vehicle-hour is $24.00 (in 2006 dollars).205  Assuming that locating a station and filling up 
requires ten minutes, the annual value of time saved as a result of less frequent refueling amounts 
to $5.20  (calculated as 10/60 x 1.3 x $24.00).  This calculation is repeated for each future 
calendar year that light trucks of each model year affected by the alternative CAFE standards 
considered in this rule would remain in service.  Like fuel savings and other benefits, however, 
the value of this benefit declines over a model year’s lifetime, because a smaller number of 
vehicles originally produced during that model year remain in service each year, and those 
remaining in service are driven fewer miles.

wage rate.  For intercity travel, personal travel (87%) is valued at 70 percent of the wage rate, while business travel 
(13%) is valued at 100 percent of the wage rate.  The resulting values of travel time are $12.67 for urban travel and 
$17.66 for intercity travel, and must be multiplied by vehicle occupancy (1.6) to obtain the estimate value of time

Summary of Benefits  
 
Benefits were calculated separately for passenger cars and light trucks under each alternative 
CAFE requirement for each model year covered by this proposal.  In Tables VIII-5 through VIII-
9, the societal impacts for passenger car CAFE standards under the proposed Optimized Net 
Benefits alternative is shown over the 2011 through 2015 model years.  Table VIII-10 
summarizes the impacts for passenger cars across all 5 model years.  In Tables VIII-11 through 
VIII-15 the societal impacts for light truck CAFE standards under the Optimized Net Benefits 
alternative is shown over the 2011 through 2015 model years.  Table VIII-16 summarizes the 
impacts for light trucks across all 5 model years.  Table VIII-17 summarizes the impacts across 
both the passenger car and light truck fleets for the 5 model years combined.  These tables 
include undiscounted values as well as present value calculations at 3 percent and 7 percent.  
They also show changes in the physical units of measure that produced these values.  Negative 
values in these tables reflect net reductions in fuel consumption or emissions and their resulting 
economic impacts, which represent benefits from the proposal, while positive values represent 
increasing emissions, congestion, noise or crash severity and their added costs.  The net social 
benefit from these societal impacts is shown on the Total line in each table.     
 
The proposed standards for passenger cars would save approximately 19 billion gallons of fuel 
and prevent 178 million metric tons of tailpipe CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the passenger 
cars sold during those model years, compared to the fuel savings and emissions reductions that 
would occur if the standards remained at the adjusted baseline (i.e., the higher of manufacturer’s 
plans or the manufacturer’s required level of average fuel economy for MY 2010).   
 
The total value of societal benefits of the proposed passenger car standards would be 
approximately $31 billion206 over the lifetime of the 5 model years combined.  This estimate of 
societal benefits includes direct impacts from lower fuel consumption as well as externalities, 
and also reflects offsetting societal costs resulting from the rebound effect.  Direct benefits to 
consumers, including fuel savings, account for 85% ($29.5 billion) of the roughly $35 billion in 
gross consumer benefits207 resulting from increased passenger car CAFE.  Petroleum market 
externalities account for roughly 10% ($3.6 billion).  Environmental externalities, i.e., reduction 
of air pollutants accounts for roughly 5% ($1.8 billion).  Over half of this $1.8 billion is the 
result of greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) reduction ($1.0 billion).  Increased congestion, noise 
and accidents from increased driving will offset roughly $3.8 billion of the $35 billion in gross 
consumer benefits, leaving total consumer benefits of $31 billion. 
 
The proposed standards for light trucks would save approximately 36 billion gallons of fuel and 
prevent 343 million metric tons of tailpipe CO2 emissions over the lifetime of the light trucks 
sold during those model years, compared to the fuel savings and emissions reductions that would 
                                                 
206 The $31 billion estimate is based on a 7% discount rate for valuing future impacts.  NHTSA estimated benefits 
using both 7% and 3% discount rates.  Under a 3% rate, net consumer benefits for passenger car CAFE 
improvements total $36 billion.  
207 Gross consumer benefits are benefits measured prior to accounting for the negative impacts of the rebound effect.  
They include fuel savings, consumer surplus from additional driving, reduced refueling time, reduced criteria 
pollutants, and reduced greenhouse gas production.  Negative impacts from the rebound effect include added 
congestion, noise, and crash costs due to additional driving.

occur if the standards remained at the adjusted baseline (i.e., the higher of manufacturer’s plans 
or the manufacturer’s required level of average fuel economy for MY 2010).   
 
The total value of societal benefits of the proposed light truck standards would be approximately 
$57 billion208 over the lifetime of the 5 model years combined.  This estimate of societal benefits 
includes direct impacts from lower fuel consumption as well as externalities, and also reflects 
offsetting societal costs resulting from the rebound effect.  Direct benefits to consumers, 
including fuel savings, account for 84% ($52.7 billion) of the roughly $63 billion in gross 
consumer benefits resulting from increased light truck CAFE.  Petroleum market externalities 
account for roughly 10% ($6.5 billion).  Environmental externalities, i.e., reduction of air 
pollutants accounts for roughly 6% ($3.5 billion).  Over half of this $3.5 billion is the result of 
greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) reduction ($1.9 billion).  Increased congestion, noise and 
accidents from increased driving will offset roughly $5.4 billion of the $63 billion in gross 
consumer benefits, leaving total consumer benefits of $57 billion. 
 
Tables VIII-18, 19, and 20 summarize the fuel savings from all alternatives over model years 
2011-2015 for passenger cars and light trucks.  Each table reports total fuel savings (in millions 
of gallons) over the lifetime of vehicles manufactured during each model year that are projected 
to occur under each scenario.  As the tables indicate, there is a steady increase in fuel savings for 
both passenger cars and light trucks with each successive model year under all 7 scenarios.  As 
would be expected, benefit levels parallel the increasing stringency of the various alternatives 
that were examined.  The two Optimized scenarios pushes technology up to the point where is 
ceases to be cost effective, but the 3% based scenario produces more benefits than the 7% based 
scenario because it places a higher value on benefits experienced in the future. The TC=TB 
scenario produces benefits that exceed the Optimized scenario because it allows benefits that 
accrue from cost-beneficial technologies to offset costs that accrue from technologies that are not 
cost-beneficial.  As might be expected, the High Technology scenario, which assumes the 
maximum use of all available technologies in all vehicles regardless of cost, produces higher 
savings than any of the 6 other scenarios in all model years.   The 25% Below Optimized, 25% 
Above Optimized, and 50% Above Optimized scenarios were designed to produce results 
relative to the Optimized scenario, and their benefits accordingly reflect this.  
 
Tables VIII-21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 summarize the total social benefits from all alternatives 
over the 2011-2015 model years for passenger cars and light trucks at both 3 percent and 7 
percent discount rates.  These tables summarize the value of net consumer benefits over the 
lifetime of the vehicles manufactured during each model year and scenario.  There is a steady 
increase in the social value of fuel savings and other benefits with each model year under all 7 
scenarios, which mirrors the trends in fuel savings noted above.  Likewise, the value of societal 
benefits mirrors the trends in stringency across alternative scenarios.  
 
 
 
                                                 
208 The $57 billion estimate is based on a 7% discount rate for valuing future impacts.  NHTSA estimated benefits 
using both 7% and 3% discount rates.  Under a 3% rate, net consumer benefits for light truck CAFE improvements 
total $72 billion.

IX.  NET BENEFITS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES 
 
This chapter compares the costs of technologies needed to make improvements in fuel economy 
to meet the alternatives with the potential benefits, expressed in total costs (millions of dollars) 
for each model year.   The costs do not include fines, since these are transfer payments.  Thus, 
the total costs shown in this section do not match the total costs shown in Chapter VII.  The 
following tables combine the estimated costs and benefits from a societal perspective.  These are 
incremental costs and benefits compared to an adjusted baseline of manufacturers’ production 
plans.  Tables utilizing a 3 percent and 7 percent discount rate for benefits are presented.   
Sensitivity analyses are also performed on some of the assumptions made in this analysis.  
Finally, a payback period is calculated, from the consumer’s perspective.   
 
Table IX-1 provides the total incremental costs (in millions of dollars) from a societal 
perspective.  Table IX-2a and Table IX-2b provide the total benefits at a 3 percent and 7 percent 
discount rate from a societal perspective for all vehicles produced during each model year to 
which the standard is applicable.    Table IX-3a and Table IX-3b show the total net benefits in 
millions of dollars at a 3 percent and 7 percent discount rate for the projected fleet of sales for 
each model year.

Total costs follow a predictable pattern with costs rising to reflect the more expensive 
technologies that manufacturers must apply in order to achieve the CAFE levels that are required 
under the more aggressive alternatives, with the exception of the Optimized (3%) for light trucks.  
For the combined fleet, total compliance costs for the Total Cost = Total Benefit alternative is 
roughly 2.8 times those for the Optimized (7%) alternative over the 5 model years.  Relative to 
the proposed Optimized (7%) alternative, Technology  exhaustion produces costs that are 3.2 
times the Optimized cost levels.

From Table IX-2a, lifetime societal benefits follow a similar predictable pattern, with higher 
benefits associated with the more expensive technologies that are enabled under the more 
aggressive alternatives.  For the combined fleet, the TC=TB alternative produces gross benefits 
roughly 1.5 times as high as the Optimized (7%) alternative, and the Technology  exhaustion 
alternative produces gross benefits that are 1.7 times the Optimized (7%) alternative.   
 
Similar results occur for benefits discounted at the 7% rate (Table IX-2b).  However, while the 
pattern for benefits is directionally similar to the pattern for costs, the more aggressive 
technology scenarios do not increase benefits by as high a ratio as they do for costs.  For 
example, the TC=TB alternative increases total benefits by $46 billion over the Optimized (7%) 
alternative, but it also increases total costs by $85 billion, a net loss to society of $39 billion.  
This is a function of the more aggressive alternatives relatively unrestrained functions.  While 
the Optimized (7%) alternative adds technology until the marginal cost to society begins to 
exceed the marginal benefit, the TC=TB scenario and the Technology  exhaustion scenario allow 
for continued investment in technology despite its negative net return.  Thus, while both costs 
and benefits continue to rise with more aggressive technologies, the costs rapidly begin to exceed 
the benefits that society derives from the added investment.

The impact of the relatively unrestricted technology application that is enabled by the more 
aggressive scenarios is apparent from Tables IX-3a and IX-3b, which show net total lifetime 
societal benefits under each alternative.  Across all 5 model years the Optimized (7%) or the 
Optimized (3%) alternative produces the highest net total benefits to society, as would be 
expected.   Under a 3% discount rate, net benefits produced by the Optimized (7%) alternative 
exceed those produced by the TC = TB alternative by an extra $27 billion, and exceed those 
produced under the Technology Exhaustion alternative by $30 billion.  Under the 7% discount 
rate, the Technology  exhaustion alternative produces a net loss to society of over $3.7 billion.

Sensitivity Analyses 
The agency has performed several sensitivity analyses to examine important assumptions.  The 
analyses include: 
 
 
1) The value of CO2.  We examined a range from $0 per metric ton to $14 per metric ton, 
with the main analysis using a value of $7.50 per metric ton.  These values can be 
translated into a value for carbon by multiplying by a factor of 3.66, or can be translated 
into cents per gallon by multiplying by 0.0089209, as shown below: 
 
$7.50 per ton CO2 = $7.50*3.667 = $27.50 per ton C = $7.50*0.0089 = $0.06675 per gallon 
$14.00 per ton CO2 = $14.00*3.667 = $51.34 per ton C = $14.00*0.0089 = $0.1246 per gallon 
 
2) The value of externalities.  The main analysis uses $0.295 per gallon for externalities.  
The sensitivity analysis examines $0.120 and $0.504 per gallon.   
 
3)  The price of gasoline.  The main analysis uses the AEO 2008 reference case estimate for 
the price of gasoline.  The preliminary AEO 2008 estimate does not contain a high price 
or low price of gasoline case.  We assumed for this analysis an estimate of the AEO 2008 
high price and low price for gasoline (based on applying the percentage increase between 
the high price estimate and the reference case estimate in the AEO 2007 forecast to the 
AEO 2008 reference case estimate).   
 
4) The rebound effect.  The main analysis uses a rebound effect of 15 percent.  The 
sensitivity analysis examines rebound effects of 10 percent and 20 percent.   
 
Sensitivity analyses were performed on just the optimized (7%) alternative.  Presented are 
information on the average mpg expected by model year, the price per vehicle increase for MY 
2015, total benefits for MY 2015 vehicles, the total cost increase for MY 2015, the total fuel 
saved (all 5 model years combined) and the total CO2 emissions reduction (all 5 model years 
combined).   
 
The results of the sensitivity analyses indicate that the value of CO2, the value of externalities, 
and the value of the rebound effect have almost no impact on the level of the standards.  
Assuming a higher price of gasoline has the largest impact of the sensitivity analyses examined 
(raising the MY 2015 passenger car standard level by 6.7 mpg and the light truck level by 0.8 
mpg).  It appears that the light truck levels are not as sensitive as the passenger car levels to 
changes in the estimated benefits.  This can occur because the technologies that have not been 
used under the Optimized alternative, and are still available for light trucks, are not that close to 
being cost effective and it takes a larger increase in benefits to bring them over the cost-benefit 
threshold.   
                                                 
209 The molecular weight of Carbon (C) is 12, the molecular weight of Oxygen (O) is 16, thus the molecular weight of 
CO2 is 44.  One ton of C = 44/12 tons CO2 = 3.67 tons CO2.  1 gallon of gas weighs 2,819 grams, of that 2,433 grams 
are carbon.  $1.00 CO2 = $3.67 C and   
$3.67/ton * ton/1000kg * kg/1000g * 2433g/gallon = (3.67 * 2433) / 1000 * 1000 = $0.0089/gallon 
 
 
  
IX-11
 
Note that there are some slight inconsistencies in the relationships one would expect when 
comparing the required mpg levels for corresponding model years in the various sensitivity 
analyses to those under the proposed CAFE standards.  For example, the level of the standard 
should increase when CO2 is assigned a higher value, because this increases the benefit of each 
gallon of fuel saved, but the optimized standards for some model years are actually lower with 
the high CO2 value than under the proposal.  Problems such as this arise when making slight 
changes in parameter values used by the CAFE model, since the model derives a relationship 
between net benefits and the stringency level of standards for each model year, and minor 
changes in parameter values can affect the exact shapes and positions of those curves.  In any 
case, the seemingly anomalous results are mostly small (0.1 mpg or less), and are sometimes the 
result of rounding.  When larger variations are made to the model’s parameters or other inputs, 
such as substituting EIA’s High gasoline price forecast for the Reference Case forecast, the 
sensitivity analysis invariable produces the anticipated result.

Payback Period 
 
The “payback period” represents the length of time required for a vehicle buyer to recoup, 
through savings in fuel use, the higher cost of purchasing a more fuel-efficient vehicle.  Thus, 
only these two factors are considered (purchase price and fuel savings).  When a higher CAFE 
standard requires a manufacturer to improve the fuel economy of some of its vehicle models, the 
manufacturer’s added costs for doing so are reflected in higher prices for these models.  While 
buyers of these models pay higher prices to purchase these vehicles, their improved fuel 
economy lowers the consumer’s costs for purchasing fuel to operate them.  Over time, buyers 
may recoup the higher purchase prices they pay for these vehicles in the form of savings in 
outlays for fuel.  The length of time required to repay the higher cost of buying a more fuel-
efficient vehicle is referred to as the buyer’s payback period.  
 
The length of this payback period depends on the initial increase in a vehicle’s purchase price, 
the improvement in its fuel economy, the number of miles it is driven each year, and the retail 
price of fuel.  We calculated payback periods using the fuel economy improvement and average 
price increase estimated to result from the standard, the future retail gasoline prices, and 
estimates of the number of miles vehicles are driven each year as they age.   These calculations 
are taken from a consumer’s perspective, not a societal perspective.  Thus, only gasoline savings 
are included on the benefits side of the equation.  The price of gasoline includes fuel taxes and 
future savings are not discounted to present value, since consumers generally only consider and 
respond to what they pay at the pump.  The payback periods was estimated for only MY 2015 
vehicles and an average of all manufacturers for the different alternatives.  The payback periods 
for MY 2015 are shown in Table IX-10.

X.  PROBABILISTIC UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS 
 
OMB Circular A-4 requires formal probabilistic uncertainty analysis of complex rules where 
there are large, multiple uncertainties whose analysis raises technical challenges or where effects 
cascade and where the impacts of the rule exceed $1 billion.  CAFE meets all of these criteria.  
This chapter identifies and quantifies the major uncertainties in the preliminary regulatory impact 
analysis and estimates the probability distribution of the benefits, costs, and net benefits of the 
compliance options selected for the proposed rule for MY 2011-2015 passenger car and light 
truck CAFE standards.  Throughout the course of the main analysis, input values were selected  
from a variety of often conflicting sources.  Best estimates were selected based on the 
preponderance of data and analyses available, but there is inevitably a level of uncertainty in 
these selections.   Some of these inputs contributed less to the overall variations of the outcomes, 
and, thus, are less significant.  Some inputs depend on others or are closely related (e.g. oil 
import externalities), and thus can be combined.  With the vast number of uncertainties 
imbedded in this regulatory analysis, this uncertainty analysis identifies only the major 
independent uncertainty factors having appreciable variability and impact on the end results and 
quantifies them by their probability distributions.  These newly defined values are then randomly 
selected and fed back into the model to determine the net benefits using the Monte Carlo 
statistical simulation technique.210  The simulation technique induces the probabilistic outcomes 
accompanied with degrees of probability or plausibility.  This facilitates a more informed 
decision-making process. 
 
The analysis is based on the actual processes used to derive net benefits as described in the 
previous chapters.  Each variable (e.g., cost of technology) in the mathematical model represents 
an uncertainty factor that would potentially alter the modeling outcomes if its value was 
changed.  We assume that these variables are independent of each other.  The confidence 
intervals around the costs and benefits of technologies reflect independent levels of uncertainty 
regarding costs and benefits, rather than linked probabilities dependent on higher or lower 
quality versions of a specific technology.  By contrast, there is reason to believe that monopsony 
costs may be dependent on fuel prices.  However, monopsony costs are only one of several oil 
import externalities, and the range of monopsony costs is quite narrow.  The potential for 
significant error due to an assumption of independence for monopsony costs is thus quite low.  
Given this, the agency has elected to treat monopsony costs as an independent variable. 
 
 The uncertainties of these variables are described by appropriate probability distribution 
functions based on available data.  If data are not sufficient or not available, professional 
judgments are used to estimate the probability distributions of these uncertainty factors.  A 
complete description of the formulas and methods used in the CAFE model is available in the 
public docket.211

After defining and quantifying the major uncertainty factors, the next step is to simulate the 
model to obtain probabilistic results rather than single-value estimates.  In the uncertainty 
analysis, CAFE levels were kept constant; in other words, we did not change the CAFE 
standards for each run based on net benefits.  The simulation process was run repeatedly for 
20,000 trials under each discount rate scenario.  Each complete run is a trial.  For each trial, the 
simulation first randomly selects a value for each of the uncertainty factors based on their 
probability distributions.  The selected values are then fit into the models to forecast results.  In 
addition to the simulation results, the program also estimates the degree of certainty (or 
confidence, credibility).  The degree of certainty provides the decision-maker with an additional 
piece of important information with which to evaluate the forecast results. 
 
 
Simulation Models and Uncertainty Factors 
A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using the CAFE modeling system that was developed 
to estimate the impacts of higher CAFE requirements described in previous chapters.  The focus 
of the simulation model was variation around the chosen uncertainty parameters and their 
resulting impact on the key output parameters, fuel savings, and net benefits.  Net benefits 
measure the difference between (1) the total dollar value that would be saved in fuel and other 
benefits and (2) the total costs of the rule. 
 
The agency reviewed the inputs and relationships that drive the CAFE model to determine the 
factors that are the major sources of uncertainty.  Five factors were identified as contributing the 
most uncertainty to the estimated impacts of higher CAFE standards: 
(1) Technology costs; 
(2) Technology effectiveness; 
(3) Fuel prices; 
(4) The value of oil consumption externalities; and 
(5) The rebound effect. 
 
 
Technology Costs 
The costs incurred by manufacturers to modify their vehicles to meet new CAFE levels are 
assumed to be passed on to consumers in the form of higher new car prices.  These technology 
costs are the primary determinant of the overall cost of improving fuel economy. 
 
Forty-one different technologies were examined as possible methods to comply with higher 
CAFE standards.  These technologies were summarized in Chapter V earlier in this analysis.  
Chapter V also summarizes the estimated range of costs for these technologies.  The expected 
values (mid-range values) were used in the main analysis.  For the uncertainty analysis, the full 
range of NAS cost estimates is used.  The uncertainty model assumes a normal distribution for 
these costs, with each end of the range being three standard deviations from the mean (or 
expected) value.  Figure X-1 graphically demonstrates the distributions of a hypothetical sample 
of three of the technologies.

Technology Effectiveness 
 
The modifications adopted by manufacturers to enable their vehicles to meet new CAFE levels 
will improve fuel efficiency and reduce the cost of operating the more efficient vehicles.   The 
effectiveness of each technology determines how large an impact it will have towards enabling 
manufacturers to meet the higher CAFE standards, and will thus determine how much additional 
improvement is needed and which additional technologies will be required to achieve full 
compliance.  In selecting the likely path that manufacturers will choose to meet CAFE, the 
CAFE model tests the interaction of technology costs and effectiveness to achieve an optimal 
(cost-minimizing) technological solution.  Technology effectiveness is thus a primary 
determinant of the overall cost and benefit of improving fuel economy.   
 
As noted above, forty-one different technologies were examined as possible methods to comply 
with higher CAFE standards.  These technologies were summarized in Chapter V earlier in this 
analysis.  Chapter V also summarizes the estimated range of effectiveness for these technologies.  
The expected values (mid-range values) were used in the main analysis.  For the uncertainty 
analysis, the full range of effectiveness estimates is used.  The uncertainties model assumes a 
normal distribution for these values, with each end of the range being three standard deviations 
from the mean (or expected) value.

Fuel Prices   
Higher CAFE standards will result in reduced gasoline consumption, which will translate into 
lower vehicle operating costs for consumers.  The value of this reduced fuel consumption is a 
direct function of fuel prices.  Fuel prices are thus a primary determinant of the overall social 
benefit that will result from improving fuel economy.    
 
The analysis attempts to measure impacts that occur as much as 40 years in the future and 
estimating gasoline prices this far in advance is an uncertain process.  In the main analysis, the 
agency utilized predicted fuel prices from the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) 
publication Annual Energy Outlook 2008 (AEO) Revised Early Release.  The main analysis is 
based on the AEO Reference Case scenario, which represents EIA’s best estimate of future fuel 
prices.  For the uncertainty analysis, the Agency examined two other AEO scenarios, the Low 
Oil Price scenario (LOP) and the High Oil Price scenario (HOP).  The AEO 2008 Early Release 
did not contain LOP and HOP estimates.  The agency therefore estimated these levels by 
adjusting the 2008 Reference case proportionately to these cases in the AEO 2007 report. The 
LOP scenario was chosen to allow for the possibility that the EIA’s Reference Case predictions 
could overestimate the price of gasoline in the future.  However, recent escalation in the price of 
gasoline has resulted in prices that have at times exceeded those estimated by EIA for their 
reference case.  It is unclear whether this just reflects a temporary spike in price levels or 
whether it is an indication of permanently higher price levels.    To reflect the possibility of 
significantly higher prices, the Agency selected the HOP case, which among the AEO 2008 
scenarios comes closest to matching the highest prices seen during the recent gasoline price 
surge, and which gives the highest gasoline price forecasts among all AEO 2008 scenarios      
           
Each of these scenarios was applied as a discrete input (i.e., draws were not made from among 
the three scenarios separately for each future year).  Rather, for each draw, one of the three 
scenarios was chosen and applied across the full vehicle life for each model year.  The 
probability of selection for each of the three scenarios was modeled using discrete weights of 50 
percent for the Reference Case, and 25 percent for both the LOP and HOP cases.  Table X-1 lists 
the AEO gasoline price forecasts under each scenario.  These same prices are demonstrated 
graphically (in 2006 economics) in Figure X-2.  Note that these prices include Federal, State, and 
local fuel taxes.  For the uncertainty analysis, taxes were removed because they are viewed as 
transfer payments (see discussion in Chapter VIII).  Estimated retail prices are shown here 
because they are a better reference point for most readers.

Oil Consumption Externalities    
 
Reduced fuel consumption can benefit society by lowering the world market price for oil,  
reducing the threat of petroleum supply disruptions, and reducing the cost of maintaining 
military security in oil producing regions and operating the strategic petroleum reserve.  These 
benefits are called “externalities” because they are not reflected directly in the market price of 
fuel.  A full description of these externalities is included in Chapter VIII under “Other Economic 
Benefits from Reducing Petroleum Use.”  These factors increase the net social benefits from 
reduced fuel consumption.  Although they represent a relatively small portion of overall social 
benefits, there is a significant level of uncertainty as to their values.  For this reason, they were 
examined in the uncertainty analysis. 
 
Table X-3 lists the range of values that were examined for oil consumption externalities.  The 
expected values were used in the main analysis.  Both the value of reducing U.S. demand on the 
world market price for oil and the value of reduced threat of supply disruptions were derived 
from a study by Leiby (2008) (see Chapter VIII).  For reasons noted in Chapter VIII, military 
security is not specifically valued in this analysis.  A normal distribution was assumed for the 
range of values for oil consumption externalities with the low and high values assumed to be two 
standard deviations from the mean, based on the Leiby estimates.

The Rebound Effect 
By reducing the amount of gasoline used and, thus, the cost of operating a vehicle, higher CAFE 
standards are expected to result in a slight increase in annual miles driven per vehicle.  This 
“rebound effect” impacts net societal benefits because the increase in miles driven offsets a 
portion of the gasoline savings that results from more fuel-efficient vehicles.  Although 
consumers derive some value from this extra driving, it also leads to increases in crash, 
congestion, noise, and pollution costs associated with driving.  Most recent estimates of the 
magnitude of the rebound effect for light duty vehicles fall in the range of 10-20 percent (i.e., 
increasing vehicle use will offset 10-20 percent of the fuel savings resulting from an 
improvement in fuel economy).  A more complete discussion of the rebound effect is included in 
Chapter VIII.  The agency employed a rebound effect of 15 percent in the main analysis.   For 
the uncertainty analysis, a range of 10 to 20 percent is used and employed in a skewed Beta 
distribution which produced a mean of approximately 14 percent.  The skewed distribution 
reflects the agency’s belief that the more credible studies that differ from the 15 percent value 
chosen for the main analysis fall below this value and differ by more substantial margins than the 
upper range of credible values.  Table X-3 Summarizes the economic parameters used in the 
uncertainty analysis.

Modeling Results – Trial Draws  
 
Because of the complexity of the CAFE model, the computer time required to perform the 
uncertainty analysis was significant.  The uncertainty analysis conducted a total of 40,000 trials 
(20,000 for each discount rate)  Figures X- 3 through X-14 graphically illustrate the draw results 
for a sample of the 85 variables (41 technology effectiveness rates, 41 technology costs, the fuel 
price scenario, oil import externalities, the rebound effect, and CO2.) that were examined.  
Tables X-3 through X-7 list the draw results for each economic input, technology cost, and 
technology effectiveness.

Modeling Results – Output 
 
Tables X-8 and X-9 summarize the modeling results for fuel saved, total costs, societal benefits, 
and net benefits for passenger cars and trucks respectively under a 7% discount rate.  They also 
indicate the probability that net benefits exceed zero.  Tables X-10 and X-11 summarize these 
same results under a 3% discount rate.    These results are also illustrated in Figures X-15 
through X-18 for passenger cars under Optimized CAFE at 7 percent for MY 2015.  Although 
not shown here, the general shape of the resulting output distributions are similar for the light 
trucks, the 3 percent discount rate, and for other model years as well.  The humped shape that 
occurs for both social benefits and net benefits reflects the three different gasoline price 
scenarios.  About half of all draws were selected from the AEO Reference Case, while about one 
quarter were drawn from the Low Oil Price scenario and one quarter were drawn from the High 
Oil Price scenario.  This produces three separate humps which reflect the increasing impact on 
benefits from the three progressively higher oil price scenarios.  The Low Oil scenario is close 
enough to the Forecast scenario that the 2 humps visually begin to merge.  However, the 
difference between the High Oil Price scenario and the Forecast is typically more than double the 
difference between the Forecast and the Low Oil price scenario, which results in a separate 
distribution further up the x axis.   The following discussions summarize the range of results 
presented in these tables for the combined passenger car and light truck across both the 7 percent 
(typically the lower range) and 3 percent (typically upper range) discount rates212.    
 
Fuel Savings:  The analysis indicates that MY 2011 vehicles (both passenger cars and light 
trucks) will experience between 3,370 million and 4,735 million gallons of fuel savings over 
their useful lifespan.  MY 2012 vehicles will experience between 7,476 million and 9,639 
million gallons of fuel savings over their useful lifespan.  MY 2013 vehicles will experience 
between 10,863 million and 13,763 million gallons of fuel savings over their useful lifespan.  
MY 2014 vehicles will experience between 12,568 and 15,664 million gallons of fuel savings 
over their useful lifespan.  MY 2015 vehicles will experience between 14,188 and 17,659 million 
gallons of fuel savings over their useful lifespan.  Over the combined lifespan of the five model 
years, between 48.5 billion and 61.4 billion gallons of fuel will be saved. 
 
Total Costs:  The analysis indicates that owners of MY 2011 passenger cars and light trucks will 
pay between $2,447 million and $5,256 million in higher vehicle prices to purchase vehicles with 
improved fuel efficiency.  MY 2012 owners will pay between $5,817 million and $10,427 
million more.  MY 2013 owners will pay between $7,942 million and $15,288 million more.  
MY 2014 owners will pay between $9,338 million and $17,189 million more.  MY 2015 owners 
will pay between $10,940 million and $19,842 million more.  Owners of all five model years 
vehicles combined will pay between $36.5 billion and $67.9 billion in higher vehicle prices to 
purchase vehicles with improved fuel efficiency. 
 
                                                 
212 In a few cases the upper range results were obtained from the 7% rate and the lower range results were obtained 
from the 3% rate.  While this may seem counterintuitive, it results from the random selection process that is inherent 
in the Monte Carlo technique.  
  
X-20
Societal Benefits:  The analysis indicates that changes to MY 2011 passenger cars and light 
trucks to meet the proposed CAFE standards will produce overall societal benefits valued 
between $4,375 million and $13,041 million.  MY 2012 vehicles will produce benefits valued 
between $9,363 million and $28,214 million.  MY 2013 vehicles will produce benefits valued 
between $13,370 million and $41,027 million.  MY 2014 vehicles will produce benefits valued 
between $15,586 million and $47,087 million.  MY 2015 vehicles will produce benefits valued 
between $17,486 million and $53,708 million.  Over the combined lifespan of the five model 
years, societal benefits valued between $60.1 billion and $183.1 billion will be produced. 
 
Net Benefits:  The uncertainty analysis indicates that the net impact of the higher CAFE 
requirements for MY 2011 passenger cars and light trucks will be a net benefit of between $937 
million and $9,678 million.  There is at least a 99.3 percent certainty that changes made to MY 
2011 vehicles to achieve the higher CAFE standards will produce a net benefit.  The net impact 
of the higher CAFE requirements for MY 2012 will be a net benefit of between $283 million and 
a net benefit of $21,139 million.  There is at least a 99.6 percent certainty that changes made to 
MY 2012 vehicles to achieve the CAFE standards will produce a net benefit.  The net impact of 
the higher CAFE requirements for MY 2013 will be a net benefit of  between $494 million and a 
net benefit of $31,311 million.  There is at least a 99.6 percent certainty that changes made to 
MY 2013 vehicles to achieve the higher CAFE standards will produce a net benefit.  The net 
impact of the higher CAFE requirements for MY 2014 will be a net benefit of between $711 
million and $35,746 million.  There is 100 percent certainty that changes made to MY 2014 
vehicles to achieve the CAFE standards will produce a net benefit. The net impact of the higher 
CAFE requirements for MY 2015 will be a net benefit of between $654 million and $40,703 
million.  There is 100 percent certainty that changes made to MY 2015 vehicles to achieve the 
CAFE standards will produce a net benefit.  Over all five model years, the higher CAFE 
standards will produce net benefits ranging from $3.1 billion to $138.6 billion.  There is at least a 
99.3 percent certainty that higher CAFE standards will produce a net societal benefit in each of 
the model years covered by this final rule.   In most years, this probability is 100%.

XI.  REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT AND UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM 
ACT ANALYSIS 
 
A. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT 
 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C §601 et seq.) requires agencies to evaluate the 
potential effects of their proposed and final rules on small business, small organizations and 
small Government jurisdictions. 
 
5 U.S.C §603 requires agencies to prepare and make available for public comments initial and 
final regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) describing the impact of proposed and final rules on 
small entities.  Section 603(b) of the Act specifies the content of a RFA.  Each RFA must 
contain: 
 
1. A description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered; 
2. A succinct statement of the objectives of, and legal basis for a final rule; 
3. A description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities to which 
the final rule will apply; 
4. A description of the projected reporting, recording keeping and other compliance 
requirements of a final rule including an estimate of the classes of small entities which 
will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record; 
5. An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may 
duplicate, overlap or conflict with the final rule; 
6. Each final regulatory flexibility analysis shall also contain a description of any significant 
alternatives to the final rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes 
and which minimize any significant economic impact of the final rule on small entities. 
 
1.  Description of the reason why action by the agency is being considered 
NHTSA is proposing this action to improve vehicle fuel economy. 
 
2. Objectives of, and legal basis for, the final rule 
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act requires the agency to set light truck fuel economy 
standards every year and allows the agency to update passenger car fuel economy standards.  The 
Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandates the setting of separate standards for 
passenger cars and for light trucks at levels sufficient to ensure that the average fuel economy of 
the combined fleet of all passenger cars and light trucks sold by all manufacturers in the U.S. in 
model year 2020 equals or exceeds 35 miles per gallon. 
   
3. Description and estimate of the number of small entities to which the final rule will apply 
The proposal will affect motor vehicle manufacturers.  There are no light truck manufacturers 
that are small businesses.  However, there are four domestically owned small passenger car 
manufacturers.    
  
Business entities are defined as small business using the North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) code, for the purpose of receiving Small Business Administration assistance.  
  
XI-2 
 
One of the criteria for determining size, as stated in 13 CFR 121.201, is the number of employees 
in the firm.  For establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing or assembling automobiles, 
light and heavy duty trucks, buses, motor homes, or motor vehicle body manufacturing, the firm 
must have less than 1,000 employees to be classified as a small business.   
 
We believe that the rulemaking would not have a significant economic impact on the small 
vehicle manufacturers because under Part 525, passenger car manufacturer making less than 
10,000 vehicles per year can petition NHTSA to have alternative standards set for those 
manufacturers.   These manufacturers currently don’t meet the 27.5 mpg standard and must 
already petition the agency for relief.  If the standard is raised, it has no meaningful impact on 
these manufacturers, they still must go through the same process and petition for relief.   
 
Currently, there are four small passenger car motor vehicle manufacturers in the United States.   
Table X1-1 provides information about the 4 small domestic manufacturers in MY 2004.  All are 
small manufacturers, having much less than 1,000 employees. 
 
Table XI-1 
Small Vehicle Manufacturers 
Manufacturer Employees Estimated Sales Sale Price Range Est. Revenues* 
Avanti 22 13 $25,000 to $63,000     $572,000 
Panoz 50 150 $90,000 to $125,000 $16,125,000 
Saleen  150 1,000 $39,000 to $59,000 $49,000,000 
Shelby 44 60 $42,000 to $135,000   $5,310,000 
*  Assuming an average sales price from the sales price range. 
 
The agency has not analyzed the impact of the proposal on these small manufacturers.  However, 
assuming they would petition the agency, rather than meet the proposal, the cost is not expected 
to be substantial.     
 
4. A description of the projected reporting, record keeping and other compliance requirements of 
a final rule including an estimate of the classes of small entities which will be subject to the 
requirement and the type of professional skills necessary for preparation of the report or record.   
This proposal includes no new requirements for reporting, record keeping of other compliance 
requirements.   
 
5. An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may duplicate, 
overlap, or conflict with the final rule   
We know of no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the final rule. 
 
6. A description of any significant alternatives to the final rule which accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the 
final rule on small entities. 
There are no other alternatives that can achieve the stated objectives without installing fuel 
economy technologies into the vehicle.   
 
  
XI-3 
 
B. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) requires agencies to prepare a 
written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final rules that include 
a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditures by States, local or tribal governments, in 
the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million annually (adjusted annually for 
inflation with base year of 1995).  Adjusting this amount by the implicit gross domestic product 
price deflator for 2006 results in $126 million (116.043/92.106 = 1.26).  The assessment may be 
included in conjunction with other assessments, as it is here. 
 
C. Market Failure or Other Specific Problem 
 
Executive Order 12866 requires that all new federal regulations specify the market failure or 
other specific problem that will be addressed by the rulemaking.  A market failure occurs when 
the market fails to allocate scarce resources to their highest-valued uses.  This can occur for 
several reasons, such as market power, externalities, or information problems.  (OMB Circular 
A-4 describes each of these in detail.  See http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a004/a-
4.pdf).   Normally in competitive markets, exchanges between self-interested buyers and sellers 
will allocate resources to their highest valued uses.  
 
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) directs the Department to balance the 
technological and economic challenges related to fuel economy with the nation's need to 
conserve energy.   Congress decided that the market would not balance these challenges in the 
best interest of the nation, and that the Department should regulate fuel economy.   
  
A-1 
 
 
APPENDIX A.  Required MPG Levels  
 
Table A-1 shows the required levels for the alternatives, along with the harmonically weighted 
average mpg.  The Act requires that the agency set standards that achieve at least an average 35 
mpg standard for MY 2020.  These tables show the progress toward that requirement for each of 
the alternatives.  The TC = TB and Technology Exhaustion alternatives already meet 35 mpg by 
MY 2015.  The 2% increase alternative makes some progress toward the 35 mpg requirement, 
but you need an average annual increase of 4.5 percent to reach 35 mpg by MY 2020.  The 
optimized alternative makes good progress toward the requirement and needs an average yearly 
increase of 2.3 percent to reach 35 mpg by MY 2020.    
 
Table A-2 shows the incremental percentage increase in the required levels, each year compared 
to the previous year.   The MY 2010 baseline for passenger cars is 27.5 mpg, and the MY 2010 
baseline for light truck is the unreformed standard for MY 2010 of 23.5 mpg.  The MY 2010 
combined harmonically average baseline for passenger cars and light trucks is 25.34314 mpg, 
based on a 50/50 split for passenger car and light truck sales for MY 2010.   The five year 
increase is the average yearly increase.  In a formula it is (regulation mpg/baseline mpg)^(1/5).  
In simple terms, for the Optimized (7%) alternative, taking the MY 2010 passenger car baseline 
of 27.5 * 1.054 * 1.054* 1.054* 1.054* 1.054 = 35.77, the mpg needed to be achieved in MY 
2015.

and a harmonic average of 25.34314 mpg for the combined fleet, assuming a 50/50 split in sales between passenger 
cars and light trucks for MY 2010.
