Rule 
AGENCY: Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS), HHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: This proposed rule would 
address proposed changes to Medicare 
Part B payment policy. We are 
proposing these changes to ensure that 
our payment systems are updated to 
reflect changes in medical practice and 
the relative value of services. This 
proposed rule also discusses 
refinements to resource-based practice 
expense (PE) relative value units 
(RVUs); geographic practice cost indices 
(GPCI) changes; malpractice RVUs; 
requests for additions to the list of 
telehealth services; several coding 
issues; payment for covered outpatient 
drugs and biologicals; the competitive 
acquisition program (CAP); application 
of health professional shortage area 
(HPSA) bonus payments; payment for 
renal dialysis services; performance 
standards for mobile independent 
diagnostic testing facilities; and 
physician and nonphysician 
practitioners furnishing diagnostic 
testing services; a solicitation for 
comments regarding the use of the 
Federal Payment Levy Program to 
recover delinquent Federal tax debts; a 
proposed amendment to the exemption 
for computer-generated facsimile 
transmissions from the National Council 
for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) 
SCRIPT standard for transmitting 
prescription and certain prescription- 
related information for Part D covered 
drugs prescribed for Part D eligible 
individuals; conforming and clarifying 
changes for comprehensive outpatient 
rehabilitation facilities (CORFs); 
revisions for rehabilitation agencies; 
therapy-related technical corrections; 
the physician quality reporting 
initiative; physician self-referral issues 
and anti-markup; beneficiary signature 
for nonemergency ambulance transport; 
the chiropractic services demonstration; 
educational requirements for nurse 
practitioners and clinical nurse 
specialists; qualifications of portable x- 
ray supplier personnel; the expiration of 
provisions of the Medicare, Medicaid, 
and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007; 
bonus payments for long ambulance 
transports; the annual update for 
clinical laboratory fees under the 
clinical laboratory fee schedule; 
physician certification/recertification 
for home health services; a prohibition 
concerning providers of sleep tests; 
organ retrieval; a revision to the 
‘‘Appeals of CMS or CMS contractor 
Determinations When a Provider or 
Supplier Fails to Meet the Requirements 
for Medicare Billing Privileges’’ final 
rule; and, potentially misvalued services 
under the physician fee schedule.

38505 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
caption ‘‘BACKGROUND’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
Since January 1, 1992, Medicare has 
paid for physicians’ services under 
section 1848 of the Social Security Act 
(the Act), ‘‘Payment for Physicians’ 
Services.’’ The Act requires that 
payments under the physician fee 
schedule (PFS) be based on national 
uniform relative value units (RVUs) 
based on the relative resources used in 
furnishing a service. Section 1848(c) of 
the Act requires that national RVUs be 
established for physician work, practice 
expense (PE), and malpractice expense. 
Before the establishment of the 
resource-based relative value system, 
Medicare payment for physicians’ 
services was based on reasonable 
charges. 
A. Development of the Relative Value 
System 
1. Work RVUs 
The concepts and methodology 
underlying the PFS were enacted as part 
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
Act (OBRA) of 1989 (Pub. L. 101–239), 
and OBRA 1990, (Pub. L. 101–508). The 
final rule, published on November 25, 
1991 (56 FR 59502), set forth the fee 
schedule for payment for physicians’ 
services beginning January 1, 1992. 
Initially, only the physician work RVUs 
were resource-based, and the PE and 
malpractice RVUs were based on 
average allowable charges. 
The physician work RVUs established 
for the implementation of the fee 
schedule in January 1992 were 
developed with extensive input from 
the physician community. A research 
team at the Harvard School of Public 
Health developed the original physician 
work RVUs for most codes in a 
cooperative agreement with the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services (DHHS). In constructing the 
code-specific vignettes for the original 
physician work RVUs, Harvard worked 
with panels of experts, both inside and 
outside the Federal government, and 
obtained input from numerous 
physician specialty groups. 
Section 1848(b)(2)(B) of the Act 
specifies that the RVUs for anesthesia 
services are based on RVUs from a 
uniform relative value guide. We 
established a separate conversion factor 
(CF) for anesthesia services, and we 
continue to utilize time units as a factor 
in determining payment for these 
services. As a result, there is a separate 
payment methodology for anesthesia 
services. 
We establish physician work RVUs for 
new and revised codes based on 
recommendations received from the 
American Medical Association’s (AMA) 
Specialty Society Relative Value Update 
Committee (RUC). 
2. Practice Expense Relative Value Units 
(PE RVUs) 
Section 121 of the Social Security Act 
Amendments of 1994 (Pub. L. 103–432), 
enacted on October 31, 1994, amended 
section 1848(c)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act and 
required us to develop resource-based 
PE RVUs for each physician’s service 
beginning in 1998. We were to consider 
general categories of expenses (such as 
office rent and wages of personnel, but 
excluding malpractice expenses) 
comprising PEs. 
Section 4505(a) of the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) (Pub. L. 105– 
33), amended section 1848(c)(2)(C)(ii) of 
the Act to delay implementation of the 
resource-based PE RVU system until 
January 1, 1999. In addition, section 
4505(b) of the BBA provided for a 4-year 
transition period from charge-based PE 
RVUs to resource-based RVUs. 
We established the resource-based PE 
RVUs for each physician’s service in a 
final rule, published November 2, 1998 
(63 FR 58814), effective for services 
furnished in 1999. Based on the 
requirement to transition to a resource- 
based system for PE over a 4-year 
period, resource-based PE RVUs did not 
become fully effective until 2002. 
This resource-based system was based 
on two significant sources of actual PE 
data: The Clinical Practice Expert Panel 
(CPEP) data; and the AMA’s 
Socioeconomic Monitoring System 
(SMS) data. The CPEP data were 
collected from panels of physicians, 
practice administrators, and 
nonphysicians (for example, registered 
nurses (RNs)) nominated by physician 
specialty societies and other groups. 
The CPEP panels identified the direct 
inputs required for each physician’s 
service in both the office setting and 
out-of-office setting. We have since 
refined and revised these inputs based 
on recommendations from the RUC. The 
AMA’s SMS data provided aggregate 
specialty-specific information on hours 
worked and PEs. 
Separate PE RVUs are established for 
procedures that can be performed in 
both a nonfacility setting, such as a 
physician’s office, and a facility setting, 
such as a hospital outpatient 
department. The difference between the 
facility and nonfacility RVUs reflects 
the fact that a facility typically receives 
separate payment from Medicare for its 
costs of providing the service, apart 
from payment under the PFS. The 
nonfacility RVUs reflect all of the direct 
and indirect PEs of providing a 
particular service. 
Section 212 of the Balanced Budget 
Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) (Pub. L. 
106–113) directed the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services (the 
Secretary) to establish a process under 
which we accept and use, to the 
maximum extent practicable and 
consistent with sound data practices, 
data collected or developed by entities 
and organizations to supplement the 
data we normally collect in determining 
the PE component. On May 3, 2000, we 
published the interim final rule (65 FR 
25664) that set forth the criteria for the 
submission of these supplemental PE 
survey data. The criteria were modified 
in response to comments received, and 
published in the Federal Register (65 
FR 65376) as part of a November 1, 2000 
final rule. The PFS final rules published 
in 2001 and 2003, respectively, (66 FR 
55246 and 68 FR 63196) extended the 
period during which we would accept 
these supplemental data through March 
1, 2005. 
In CY 2007 PFS final rule with 
comment period (71 FR 69624), we 
revised the methodology for calculating 
PE RVUs beginning in CY 2007 and 
provided for a 4-year transition for the 
new PE RVUs under this new 
methodology. We will continue to 
evaluate this policy and proposed 
necessary revisions through future 
rulemaking. 
3. Resource-Based Malpractice (MP) 
RVUs 
Section 4505(f) of the BBA amended 
section 1848(c) of the Act requiring us 
to implement resource-based 
malpractice (MP) RVUs for services 
furnished on or after 2000. The 
resource-based MP RVUs were 
implemented in the PFS final rule 
published November 2, 1999 (64 FR 
59380). The MP RVUs were based on 
malpractice insurance premium data 
collected from commercial and 
physician-owned insurers from all the 
States, the District of Columbia, and 
Puerto Rico. 
4. Refinements to the RVUs 
Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(i) of the Act 
requires that we review all RVUs no less 
often than every 5 years. The first 5– 
Year Review of the physician work 
RVUs was published on November 22, 
1996 (61 FR 59489) and was effective in 
1997. The second 5–Year Review was 
published in the CY 2002 PFS final rule 
with comment period (66 FR 55246) and 
was effective in 2002. The third 5–Year 
Review of physician work RVUs was 
published in the CY 2007 PFS final rule 
with comment period (71 FR 69624) and 
was effective on January 1, 2007. (Note:

38506 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Year Review of physician work RVUs 
were addressed in the CY 2008 PFS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
66360).) 
In 1999, the AMA’s RUC established 
the Practice Expense Advisory 
Committee (PEAC) for the purpose of 
refining the direct PE inputs. Through 
March 2004, the PEAC provided 
recommendations to CMS for over 7,600 
codes (all but a few hundred of the 
codes currently listed in the AMA’s 
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 
codes). As part of the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period (71 FR 
69624), we implemented a new 
methodology for determining resource- 
based PE RVUs and are transitioning 
this over a 4-year period. 
In the CY 2005 PFS final rule with 
comment period (69 FR 66236), we 
implemented the first 5–Year Review of 
the MP RVUs (69 FR 66263). 
5. Adjustments to RVUs are Budget 
Neutral 
Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act 
provides that adjustments in RVUs for a 
year may not cause total PFS payments 
to differ by more than $20 million from 
what they would have been if the 
adjustments were not made. In 
accordance with section 
1848(c)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act, if 
adjustments to RVUs cause 
expenditures to change by more than 
$20 million, we make adjustments to 
ensure that expenditures do not increase 
or decrease by more than $20 million. 
As explained in the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period (71 FR 
69624), due to the increase in work 
RVUs resulting from the third 5–Year 
Review of physician work RVUs, we 
applied a separate budget neutrality 
(BN) adjustor to the work RVUs for 
services furnished during 2007. This 
approach is consistent with the method 
we use to make BN adjustments to the 
PE RVUs to reflect the changes in these 
PE RVUs. 
B. Components of the Fee Schedule 
Payment Amounts 
To calculate the payment for every 
physician’s service, the components of 
the fee schedule (physician work, PE, 
and MP RVUs) are adjusted by a 
geographic practice cost index (GPCI). 
The GPCIs reflect the relative costs of 
physician work, PE, and malpractice 
insurance in an area compared to the 
national average costs for each 
component. 
RVUs are converted to dollar amounts 
through the application of a CF, which 
is calculated by CMS’ Office of the 
Actuary (OACT). 
The formula for calculating the 
Medicare fee schedule payment amount 
for a given service and fee schedule area 
can be expressed as: 
Payment = [(RVU work × budget 
neutrality adjustor (round product 
to two decimal places) × GPCI 
work) + (RVU PE x GPCI PE) + 
(RVU malpractice × GPCI 
malpractice)] × CF. 
C. Most Recent Changes to the Fee 
Schedule 
The CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66222) 
addressed certain provisions of Division 
B of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act 
of 2006—Medicare Improvements and 
Extension Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109–432) 
(MIEA–TRHCA), and made other 
changes to Medicare Part B payment 
policy to ensure that our payment 
systems are updated to reflect changes 
in medical practice and the relative 
value of services. The CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period also 
discussed refinements to resource-based 
PE RVUs; GPCI changes; malpractice 
RVUs; requests for additions to the list 
of telehealth services; several coding 
issues including additional codes from 
the 5-Year Review; payment for covered 
outpatient drugs and biologicals; the 
competitive acquisition program (CAP); 
clinical lab fee schedule issues; 
payment for end-stage renal dialysis 
(ESRD) services; performance standards 
facilities; expiration of the physician 
scarcity area (PSA) bonus payment; 
conforming and clarifying changes for 
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
facilities (CORFs); a process for 
updating the drug compendia; physician 
self-referral issues; beneficiary signature 
for ambulance transport services; 
durable medical equipment (DME) 
update; the chiropractic services 
demonstration; a Medicare economic 
index (MEI) data change; technical 
corrections; standards and requirement 
related to therapy services under 
Medicare Parts A and B; revisions to the 
ambulance fee schedule; the ambulance 
inflation factor for CY 2008; and an 
amendment to the e-prescribing 
exemption for computer-generated 
facsimile transmissions 
We also finalized the calendar year 
(CY) 2007 interim RVUs and issued 
interim RVUs for new and revised 
procedure codes for CY 2008. 
In accordance with section 
1848(d)(1)(E)(i) of the Act, we also 
announced that the PFS update for CY 
2008 is ¥10.1 percent, the initial 
estimate for the sustainable growth rate 
(SGR) for CY 2008 is 2.2 percent and the 
CF for CY 2008 is $34.0682. However, 
subsequent to publication of the CY 
2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period, section 101(a) of the Medicare, 
Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 
2007 (Pub. L. 110–173) (MMSEA) was 
enacted on December 29, 2007 and 
provided for a 0.5 percent update to the 
conversion factor for the period 
beginning January 1, 2008 and ending 
June 30, 2008. Therefore, for the first 
half of 2008 (that is, January through 
June), the Medicare PFS conversion 
factor was $38.0870. For the remaining 
portion of 2008 (July through 
December), the Medicare PFS 
conversion factor will be $34.0682 (as 
published in the 2008 PFS final rule 
with comment period). 
II. Provisions of the Proposed 
Regulation 
A. Resource-Based Practice Expense 
(PE) Relative Value Units (RVUs) 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘RESOURCE-BASED PE RVUs’’ 
at the beginning of your comments.] 
Practice expense (PE) is the portion of 
the resources used in furnishing the 
service that reflects the general 
categories of physician and practitioner 
expenses, such as office rent and 
personnel wages but excluding 
malpractice expenses, as specified in 
section 1848(c)(1)(B) of the Act. 
Section 121 of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1994 (Pub. L. 103–432), 
enacted on October 31, 1994, required 
CMS to develop a methodology for a 
resource-based system for determining 
PE RVUs for each physician’s service. 
Until that time, PE RVUs were based on 
historical allowed charges. This 
legislation stated that the revised PE 
methodology must consider the staff, 
equipment, and supplies used in the 
provision of various medical and 
surgical services in various settings 
beginning in 1998. The Secretary has 
interpreted this to mean that Medicare 
payments for each service would be 
based on the relative PE resources 
typically involved with furnishing the 
service. 
The initial implementation of 
resource-based PE RVUs was delayed 
from January 1, 1998, until January 1, 
1999, by section 4505(a) of the BBA. In 
addition, section 4505(b) of the BBA 
required that the new payment 
methodology be phased in over 4 years, 
effective for services furnished in CY 
1999, and fully effective in CY 2002. 
The first step toward implementation of 
the statute was to adjust the PE values 
for certain services for CY 1998. Section 
4505(d) of the BBA required that, in 
developing the resource-based PE RVUs, 
the Secretary must—

38507 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
• Use, to the maximum extent 
possible, generally-accepted cost 
accounting principles that recognize all 
staff, equipment, supplies, and 
expenses, not solely those that can be 
linked to specific procedures and actual 
data on equipment utilization. 
• Develop a refinement method to be 
used during the transition. 
• Consider, in the course of notice 
and comment rulemaking, impact 
projections that compare new proposed 
payment amounts to data on actual 
physician PE. 
In CY 1999, we began the 4-year 
transition to resource-based PE RVUs 
utilizing a ‘‘top-down’’ methodology 
whereby we allocated aggregate 
specialty-specific practice costs to 
individual procedures. The specialty- 
specific PEs were derived from the 
American Medical Association’s 
(AMA’s) Socioeconomic Monitoring 
Survey (SMS). In addition, under 
section 212 of the BBRA, we established 
a process extending through March 2005 
to supplement the SMS data with data 
submitted by a specialty. The aggregate 
PEs for a given specialty were then 
allocated to the services furnished by 
that specialty on the basis of the direct 
input data (that is, the staff time, 
equipment, and supplies) and work 
RVUs assigned to each CPT code. 
For CY 2007, we implemented a new 
methodology for calculating PE RVUs. 
Under this new methodology, we use 
the same data sources for calculating PE, 
but instead of using the ‘‘top-down’’ 
approach to calculate the direct PE 
RVUs, under which the aggregate direct 
and indirect costs for each specialty are 
allocated to each individual service, we 
now utilize a ‘‘bottom-up’’ approach to 
calculate the direct costs. Under the 
‘‘bottom up’’ approach, we determine 
the direct PE by adding the costs of the 
resources (that is, the clinical staff, 
equipment, and supplies) typically 
required to provide each service. The 
costs of the resources are calculated 
using the refined direct PE inputs 
assigned to each CPT code in our PE 
database, which are based on our review 
of recommendations received from the 
AMA’s Relative Value Update 
Committee (RUC). For a more detailed 
explanation of the PE methodology see 
the June 29, 2006 proposed notice (71 
FR 37242) and the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period (71 FR 
69629). 
1. Current Methodology 
a. Data Sources for Calculating Practice 
Expense 
The AMA’s SMS survey data and 
supplemental survey data from the 
specialties of cardiothoracic surgery, 
vascular surgery, physical and 
occupational therapy, independent 
laboratories, allergy/immunology, 
cardiology, dermatology, 
gastroenterology, radiology, 
independent diagnostic testing facilities 
(IDTFs), radiation oncology, and urology 
are used to develop the PE per hour (PE/ 
HR) for each specialty. For those 
specialties for which we do not have 
PE/HR, the appropriate PE/HR is 
obtained from a crosswalk to a similar 
specialty. 
The AMA developed the SMS survey 
in 1981 and discontinued it in 1999. 
Beginning in 2002, we incorporated the 
1999 SMS survey data into our 
calculation of the PE RVUs, using a 5- 
year average of SMS survey data. (See 
the CY 2002 PFS final rule with 
comment period (66 FR 55246).) The 
SMS PE survey data are adjusted to a 
common year, 2005. The SMS data 
provide the following six categories of 
PE costs: 
• Clinical payroll expenses, which 
are payroll expenses (including fringe 
benefits) for nonphysician clinical 
personnel. 
• Administrative payroll expenses, 
which are payroll expenses (including 
fringe benefits) for nonphysician 
personnel involved in administrative, 
secretarial, or clerical activities. 
• Office expenses, which include 
expenses for rent, mortgage interest, 
depreciation on medical buildings, 
utilities, and telephones. 
• Medical material and supply 
expenses, which include expenses for 
drugs, x-ray films, and disposable 
medical products. 
• Medical equipment expenses, 
which include depreciation, leases, and 
rent of medical equipment used in the 
diagnosis or treatment of patients. 
• All other expenses, which include 
expenses for legal services, accounting, 
office management, professional 
association memberships, and any 
professional expenses not previously 
mentioned in this section. 
In accordance with section 212 of the 
BBRA, we established a process to 
supplement the SMS data for a specialty 
with data collected by entities and 
organizations other than the AMA (that 
is, those entities and organizations 
representing the specialty itself). (See 
the Criteria for Submitting 
Supplemental Practice Expense Survey 
Data interim final rule with comment 
period (65 FR 25664).) Originally, the 
deadline to submit supplementary 
survey data was through August 1, 2001. 
In the CY 2002 PFS final rule (66 FR 
55246), the deadline was extended 
through August 1, 2003. To ensure 
maximum opportunity for specialties to 
submit supplementary survey data, we 
extended the deadline to submit surveys 
until March 1, 2005 in the Revisions to 
Payment Policies Under the Physician 
Fee Schedule for CY 2004 final rule 
with comment period (68 FR 63196) 
(hereinafter referred to as CY 2004 PFS 
final rule with comment period). 
The direct cost data for individual 
services were originally developed by 
the Clinical Practice Expert Panels 
(CPEP). The CPEP data include the 
supplies, equipment, and staff times 
specific to each procedure. The CPEPs 
consisted of panels of physicians, 
practice administrators, and 
nonphysicians (for example, RNs) who 
were nominated by physician specialty 
societies and other groups. There were 
15 CPEPs consisting of 180 members 
from more than 61 specialties and 
subspecialties. Approximately 50 
percent of the panelists were 
physicians. 
The CPEPs identified specific inputs 
involved in each physician’s service 
provided in an office or facility setting. 
The inputs identified were the quantity 
and type of nonphysician labor, medical 
supplies, and medical equipment. 
In 1999, the AMA’s RUC established 
the Practice Expense Advisory 
Committee (PEAC). From 1999 to March 
2004, the PEAC, a multi-specialty 
committee, reviewed the original CPEP 
inputs and provided us with 
recommendations for refining these 
direct PE inputs for existing CPT codes. 
Through its last meeting in March 2004, 
the PEAC provided recommendations 
for over 7,600 codes which we have 
reviewed and almost all of which we 
have accepted. As a result, the current 
PE inputs differ markedly from those 
originally recommended by the CPEPs. 
The PEAC has now been replaced by the 
Practice Expense Review Committee 
(PERC), which acts to assist the RUC in 
recommending PE inputs. 
b. Allocation of PE to Services 
The aggregate level specialty-specific 
PEs are derived from the AMA’s SMS 
survey and supplementary survey data. 
To establish PE RVUs for specific 
services, it is necessary to establish the 
direct and indirect PE associated with 
each service. 
(i) Direct costs. The direct costs are 
determined by adding the costs of the 
resources (that is, the clinical staff, 
equipment, and supplies) typically 
required to provide the service. The 
costs of these resources are calculated 
from the refined direct PE inputs in our 
PE database. These direct inputs are 
then scaled to the current aggregate pool 
of direct PE RVUs. The aggregate pool

38508 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
of direct PE RVUs can be derived using 
the following formula: 
(PE RVUs × physician CF) × (average 
direct percentage from SMS / 
(Supplemental PE/HR data)). 
(ii) Indirect costs. The SMS and 
supplementary survey data are the 
source for the specialty-specific 
aggregate indirect costs used in our PE 
calculations. Then, we allocate the 
indirect costs to the code level on the 
basis of the direct costs specifically 
associated with a code and the 
maximum of either the clinical labor 
costs or the physician work RVUs. For 
calculation of the 2009 PE RVUs, we are 
proposing to use the 2007 procedure- 
specific utilization data crosswalked to 
2008 services. To arrive at the indirect 
PE costs— 
• We apply a specialty-specific 
indirect percentage factor to the direct 
expenses to recognize the varying 
proportion that indirect costs represent 
of total costs by specialty. For a given 
service, the specific indirect percentage 
factor to apply to the direct costs for the 
purpose of the indirect allocation is 
calculated as the weighted average of 
the ratio of the indirect to direct costs 
(based on the survey data) for the 
specialties that furnish the service. For 
example, if a service is furnished by a 
single specialty with indirect PEs that 
were 75 percent of total PEs, the indirect 
percentage factor to apply to the direct 
costs for the purposes of the indirect 
allocation would be (0.75 / 0.25) = 3.0. 
The indirect percentage factor is then 
applied to the service level adjusted 
indirect PE allocators. 
• We use the specialty-specific PE/HR 
from the SMS survey data, as well as the 
supplemental surveys for cardiothoracic 
surgery, vascular surgery, physical and 
occupational therapy, independent 
laboratories, allergy/immunology, 
cardiology, dermatology, radiology, 
gastroenterology, IDTFs, radiation 
oncology, and urology. (Note: For 
radiation oncology, the data represent 
the combined survey data from the 
American Society for Therapeutic 
Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) and 
the Association of Freestanding 
Radiation Oncology Centers (AFROC)). 
As discussed in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
66233), the PE/HR survey data for 
radiology is weighted by practice size. 
We incorporate this PE/HR into the 
calculation of indirect costs using an 
index which reflects the relationship 
between each specialty’s indirect 
scaling factor and the overall indirect 
scaling factor for the entire PFS. For 
example, if a specialty had an indirect 
practice cost index of 2.00, this 
specialty would have an indirect scaling 
factor that was twice the overall average 
indirect scaling factor. If a specialty had 
an indirect practice cost index of 0.50, 
this specialty would have an indirect 
scaling factor that was half the overall 
average indirect scaling factor. 
• When the clinical labor portion of 
the direct PE RVU is greater than the 
physician work RVU for a particular 
service, the indirect costs are allocated 
based upon the direct costs and the 
clinical labor costs. For example, if a 
service has no physician work and 1.10 
direct PE RVUs, and the clinical labor 
portion of the direct PE RVUs is 0.65 
RVUs, we would use the 1.10 direct PE 
RVUs and the 0.65 clinical labor 
portions of the direct PE RVUs to 
allocate the indirect PE for that service. 
c. Facility/Nonfacility Costs 
Procedures that can be furnished in a 
physician’s office, as well as in a 
hospital or facility setting, have two PE 
RVUs: Facility and nonfacility. The 
nonfacility setting includes physicians’ 
offices, patients’ homes, freestanding 
imaging centers, and independent 
pathology labs. Facility settings include 
hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers 
(ASCs), and skilled nursing facilities 
(SNFs). The methodology for calculating 
PE RVUs is the same for both facility 
and nonfacility RVUs, but is applied 
independently to yield two separate PE 
RVUs. Because the PEs for services 
provided in a facility setting are 
generally included in the payment to 
the facility (rather than the payment to 
the physician under the PFS), the PE 
RVUs are generally lower for services 
provided in the facility setting. 
d. Services With Technical Components 
(TCs) and Professional Components 
(PCs) 
Diagnostic services are generally 
comprised of two components: A 
professional component (PC) and a 
technical component (TC), both of 
which may be performed independently 
or by different providers. When services 
have TCs, PCs, and global components 
that can be billed separately, the 
payment for the global component 
equals the sum of the payment for the 
TC and PC. This is a result of using a 
weighted average of the ratio of indirect 
to direct costs across all the specialties 
that furnish the global components, TCs, 
and PCs; that is, we apply the same 
weighted average indirect percentage 
factor to allocate indirect expenses to 
the global components, PCs, and TCs for 
a service. (The direct PE RVUs for the 
TC and PC sum to the global under the 
bottom-up methodology.) 
e. Transition Period 
As discussed in the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period (71 FR 
69674), we are implementing the change 
in the methodology for calculating PE 
RVUs over a 4-year period. During this 
transition period, the PE RVUs will be 
calculated on the basis of a blend of 
RVUs calculated using our methodology 
described previously in this section 
(weighted by 25 percent during CY 
2007, 50 percent during CY 2008, 75 
percent during CY 2009, and 100 
percent thereafter), and the CY 2006 PE 
RVUs for each existing code. PE RVUs 
for codes that are new during this 
period will be calculated using only the 
current PE methodology and will be 
paid at the fully transitioned rate. 
f. PE RVU Methodology 
The following is a description of the 
PE RVU methodology. 
(i) Setup File 
First, we create a setup file for the PE 
methodology. The setup file contains 
the direct cost inputs, the utilization for 
each procedure code at the specialty 
and facility/nonfacility place of service 
level, and the specialty-specific survey 
PE per physician hour data. 
(ii) Calculate the Direct Cost PE RVUs 
Sum the costs of each direct input. 
Step 1: Sum the direct costs of the 
inputs for each service. The direct costs 
consist of the costs of the direct inputs 
for clinical labor, medical supplies, and 
medical equipment. The clinical labor 
cost is the sum of the cost of all the staff 
types associated with the service; it is 
the product of the time for each staff 
type and the wage rate for that staff 
type. The medical supplies cost is the 
sum of the supplies associated with the 
service; it is the product of the quantity 
of each supply and the cost of the 
supply. The medical equipment cost is 
the sum of the cost of the equipment 
associated with the service; it is the 
product of the number of minutes each 
piece of equipment is used in the 
service and the equipment cost per 
minute. The equipment cost per minute 
is calculated as described at the end of 
this section. 
Apply a BN adjustment to the direct 
inputs. 
Step 2: Calculate the current aggregate 
pool of direct PE costs. To do this, 
multiply the current aggregate pool of 
total direct and indirect PE costs (that is, 
the current aggregate PE RVUs 
multiplied by the CF) by the average 
direct PE percentage from the SMS and 
supplementary specialty survey data.

direct costs. To do this, for all PFS

services, sum the product of the direct 
costs for each service from Step 1 and 
the utilization data for that service. 
Step 4: Using the results of Step 2 and 
Step 3 calculate a direct PE BN 
adjustment so that the proposed 
aggregate direct cost pool does not 
exceed the current aggregate direct cost 
pool and apply it to the direct costs 
from Step 1 for each service. 
Step 5: Convert the results of Step 4 
to an RVU scale for each service. To do 
this, divide the results of Step 4 by the 
Medicare PFS CF. 
(iii) Create the indirect PE RVUs 
Create indirect allocators. 
Step 6: Based on the SMS and 
supplementary specialty survey data, 
calculate direct and indirect PE 
percentages for each physician 
specialty. 
Step 7: Calculate direct and indirect 
PE percentages at the service level by 
taking a weighted average of the results 
of Step 6 for the specialties that furnish 
the service. Note that for services with 
TCs and PCs we are calculating the 
direct and indirect percentages across 
the global components, PCs, and TCs. 
That is, the direct and indirect 
percentages for a given service (for 
example, echocardiogram) do not vary 
by the PC, TC and global component. 
Step 8: Calculate the service level 
allocators for the indirect PEs based on 
the percentages calculated in Step 7. 
The indirect PEs are allocated based on 
the three components: the direct PE 
RVU, the clinical PE RVU, and the work 
RVU. 
For most services the indirect 
allocator is: indirect percentage * (direct 
PE RVU/direct percentage) + work RVU. 
There are two situations where this 
formula is modified: 
• If the service is a global service (that 
is, a service with global, professional, 
and technical components), then the 
indirect allocator is: indirect percentage 
* (direct PE RVU/direct percentage) + 
clinical PE RVU + work RVU. 
• If the clinical labor PE RVU exceeds 
the work RVU (and the service is not a 
global service), then the indirect 
allocator is: indirect percentage * (direct 
PE RVU/direct percentage) + clinical PE 
RVU. 
Note: For global services, the indirect 
allocator is based on both the work RVU and 
the clinical labor PE RVU. We do this to 
recognize that, for the professional service, 
indirect PEs will be allocated using the work 
RVUs, and for the TC service, indirect PEs 
will be allocated using the direct PE RVU and 
the clinical labor PE RVU. This also allows 
the global component RVUs to equal the sum 
of the PC and TC RVUs. 
For presentation purposes in the 
examples in Table 1, the formulas were 
divided into two parts for each service. 
The first part does not vary by service 
and is the indirect percentage * (direct 
PE RVU/direct percentage). The second 
part is either the work RVU, clinical PE 
RVU, or both depending on whether the 
service is a global service and whether 
the clinical PE RVU exceeds the work 
RVU (as described earlier in this step). 
Apply a BN adjustment to the indirect 
allocators. 
Step 9: Calculate the current aggregate 
pool of indirect PE RVUs by multiplying 
the current aggregate pool of PE RVUs 
by the average indirect PE percentage 
from the physician specialty survey 
data. This is similar to the Step 2 
calculation for the direct PE RVUs. 
Step 10: Calculate an aggregate pool of 
proposed indirect PE RVUs for all PFS 
services by adding the product of the 
indirect PE allocators for a service from 
Step 8 and the utilization data for that 
service. This is similar to the Step 3 
calculation for the direct PE RVUs. 
Step 11: Using the results of Step 9 
and Step 10, calculate an indirect PE 
adjustment so that the aggregate indirect 
allocation does not exceed the available 
aggregate indirect PE RVUs and apply it 
to indirect allocators calculated in Step 
8. This is similar to the Step 4 
calculation for the direct PE RVUs. 
Calculate the Indirect Practice Cost 
Index. 
Step 12: Using the results of Step 11, 
calculate aggregate pools of specialty- 
specific adjusted indirect PE allocators 
for all PFS services for a specialty by 
adding the product of the adjusted 
indirect PE allocator for each service 
and the utilization data for that service. 
Step 13: Using the specialty-specific 
indirect PE/HR data, calculate specialty- 
specific aggregate pools of indirect PE 
for all PFS services for that specialty by 
adding the product of the indirect PE/ 
HR for the specialty, the physician time 
for the service, and the specialty’s 
utilization for the service. 
Step 14: Using the results of Step 12 
and Step 13, calculate the specialty- 
specific indirect PE scaling factors as 
under the current methodology. 
Step 15: Using the results of Step 14, 
calculate an indirect practice cost index 
at the specialty level by dividing each 
specialty-specific indirect scaling factor 
by the average indirect scaling factor for 
the entire PFS. 
Step 16: Calculate the indirect 
practice cost index at the service level 
to ensure the capture of all indirect 
costs. Calculate a weighted average of 
the practice cost index values for the 
specialties that furnish the service. 
(NOTE: For services with TCs and PCs, 
we calculate the indirect practice cost 
index across the global components, 
PCs, and TCs. Under this method, the 
indirect practice cost index for a given 
service (for example, echocardiogram) 
does not vary by the PC, TC and global 
component.) 
Step 17: Apply the service level 
indirect practice cost index calculated 
in Step 16 to the service level adjusted 
indirect allocators calculated in Step 11 
to get the indirect PE RVU. 
(iv) Calculate the Final PE RVUs 
Step 18: Add the direct PE RVUs from 
Step 6 to the indirect PE RVUs from 
Step 17. 
Step 19: Calculate and apply the final 
PE BN adjustment by comparing the 
results of Step 18 to the current pool of 
PE RVUs. This final BN adjustment is 
required primarily because certain 
specialties are excluded from the PE 
RVU calculation for rate-setting 
purposes, but all specialties are 
included for purposes of calculating the 
final BN adjustment. (See ‘‘Specialties 
excluded from rate-setting calculation’’ 
below in this section.) 
(v) Setup File Information 
• Specialties excluded from rate- 
setting calculation: For the purposes of 
calculating the PE RVUs, we exclude 
certain specialties such as midlevel 
practitioners paid at a percentage of the 
PFS, audiology, and low volume 
specialties from the calculation. These 
specialties are included for the purposes 
of calculating the BN adjustment. 
• Crosswalk certain low volume 
physician specialties: Crosswalk the 
utilization of certain specialties with 
relatively low PFS utilization to the 
associated specialties. 
• Physical therapy utilization: 
Crosswalk the utilization associated 
with all physical therapy services to the 
specialty of physical therapy. 
• Identify professional and technical 
services not identified under the usual 
TC and 26 modifiers: Flag the services 
that are PC and TC services, but do not 
use TC and 26 modifiers (for example, 
electrocardiograms). This flag associates 
the PC and TC with the associated 
global code for use in creating the 
indirect PE RVU. For example, the 
professional service code 93010 is 
associated with the global code 93000. 
• Payment modifiers: Payment 
modifiers are accounted for in the 
creation of the file. For example, 
services billed with the assistant at 
surgery modifier are paid 16 percent of 
the PFS amount for that service; 
therefore, the utilization file is modified 
to only account for 16 percent of any 
service that contains the assistant at 
surgery modifier.

• Work RVUs: The setup file contains 
the work RVUs from this proposed rule. 
(vi) Equipment Cost per Minute 
The equipment cost per minute is 
calculated as: 
(1/(minutes per year * usage)) * price * 
((interest rate/(1 ¥ (1/((1 + interest 
rate) * life of equipment)))) + 
maintenance) 
Where: 
minutes per year = maximum minutes per 
year if usage were continuous (that is, 
usage = 1); 150,000 minutes. 
usage = equipment utilization assumption; 
0.5. 
price = price of the particular piece of 
equipment. 
interest rate = 0.11. 
life of equipment = useful life of the 
particular piece of equipment. 
maintenance = factor for maintenance; 0.05. 
Note: To illustrate the PE calculation, in 
Table 1 we have used the conversion factor 
(CF) of $34.0682 which was published in the 
CY 2008 PFS final rule with comment period.

2. PE Proposals for CY 2009 
a. RUC Recommendations for Direct PE 
Inputs 
The RUC provided recommendations 
for PE inputs for the codes listed in the 
Table 2. 
TABLE 2.—CODES WITH RUC PE 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
CPT 1 
code Description

1 CPT codes and descriptions are copyright 
2008 American Medical Association. 
We are in agreement with the RUC 
recommendations, (including the 
recommendation that no change be 
made to the direct inputs for CPT 93510, 
a cardiac catheterization code), except 
for inclusion of the clinical staff time 
related to quality activities for the 
following immunization codes: CPT 
codes 90465, 90466, 90467, 90468, 
90471, 90472, 90473 and 90474. While 
we allow this time for mammography 
services due to the specific regulatory 
requirements required by the 
Mammography Quality Standards Act of 
1992 (Pub. L. 102–539) (MQSA), such 
MQSA time is not a regulatory 
requirement for immunization services. 
b. Equipment Time-in-Use 
The formula for estimating the cost 
per minute for equipment is based upon 
a variety of factors, including the cost of 
the equipment, useful life, interest rate, 
maintenance cost, and utilization. The 
purpose of this formula is to identify an 
estimated cost per minute for the 
equipment that can be multiplied by the 
time the equipment is in use to obtain 
an estimated per use equipment cost to 
develop the resource-based PE RVU. 
In calculating the estimated cost per 
minute for services that are in use 24 
hours per day for 7 days per week, we 
have assumed that the maximum 
amount of time that the equipment can 
be in use is approximately 525,000 
minutes (that is, 525,000 minutes = (24 
hours per day) × (7 days per week) × (52 
weeks per year) × (60 minutes per 
hour)). 
For CY 2008, we used 525,000 
minutes to calculate the per minute 
equipment cost for the equipment used 
in CPT code 93012, Telephonic 
transmission of post-symptom 
electrocardiogram rhythm strip(s), 24- 
hour attended monitoring, per 30 day 
period of time; tracing only and CPT 
code 93271, Patient demand single or 
multiple event recording with 
presymptom memory loop, 24-hour 
attended monitoring, per 30 day period 
of time; monitoring, receipt of 
transmissions, and analysis. Based on 
information presented to us by a 
provider group suggesting that the 
equipment was in use continuously, we 
determined that this equipment is used 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Thus, we 
assigned the equipment a 100 percent 
usage rate. However, in subsequent 
discussions with a provider group, we 
determined that, although there may be 
a 100 percent usage rate for a particular 
month, this does not correspond to a 
100 percent usage rate for a year. 
Therefore, for CY 2009 we are proposing 
to apply our standard utilization rate of 
50 percent to the 525,000 maximum 
minutes of use, consistent with our 
utilization rate assumption for other 
equipment. This results in 262,500 
minutes (that is, 262,500 = 525,000 × 
0.50) of average use over the course of 
the year. 
In the CY 2008 PFS rule, we used 
43,200 minutes (60 minutes per hour × 
24 hours per day × 30 days per month) 
to estimate the per use cost of the 
equipment in these monthly services. 
We are continuing to use 43,200 
minutes in determining the equipment 
cost per use for these codes. The PE 
RVUs would increase from 5.28 to 5.98 
as a result of this change. 
c. Change to PE Database Inputs for 
Certain Cardiac Stress Tests 
The direct PE inputs for CPT code 
93025, Microvolt T-wave alternans for 
assessment of ventricular arrhythmias, 
for clinical labor are not consistent with 
the other cardiac stress tests, CPT codes 
93015, Cardiovascular stress test using 
maximal or submaximal treadmill or 
bicycle exercise, continuous 
electrocardiographic monitoring, and/or 
pharmacological stress; with physician 
supervision, with interpretation and 
report, and 93017, Cardiovascular stress 
test using maximal or submaximal 
treadmill or bicycle exercise, continuous 
electrocardiographic monitoring, and/or 
pharmacological stress; tracing only, 
without interpretation and report. These 
codes were refined by the PEAC in 
January 2002, the same year that CPT 
code 93025 was implemented. Because 
of this overlap in timing, the codes that 
the PEAC refined utilize registered 
nurses (RNs) while CPT 93025 uses a 
‘‘blend’’ of RNs and physicians. 
To provide consistency across the 
family, we are proposing to designate 
the RN as the labor type for CPT code 
93025. In addition, we are proposing to 
add the specific Micro-volt T-wave 
testing equipment, priced at $40,000, to 
replace the two different cardiac stress 
testing treadmill devices that are 
currently assigned to this code and 
reflected in the PE database. We are also 
proposing to assign the service period 
time, 53 minutes, to the exam table and 
the Micro-volt T-wave testing treadmill 
because neither piece of equipment is 
available for use by others during the 
testing interval. The T-wave stress test 
must be done in quiet room. Using this 
rationale for the other two stress testing 
CPT codes (that is, 93015 and 93017), 
we are also proposing to revise the PE 
database for these services and allocate 
the 55-minute service period time to the 
exam table and the stress testing 
equipment rather than the 41 minutes 
currently assigned. 
d. Revisions to § 414.22(b)(5)(i) 
Concerning Practice Expense 
Current regulations at § 414.22(b)(5)(i) 
provide an explanation of the two levels 
of PE RVUs—facility and nonfacility— 
that are used in determining payment 
under the PFS. Section 
414.22(b)(5)(i)(A) discusses facility PE 
RVUs and § 414.22 (b)(5)(i)(B) discusses 
nonfacility PE RVUs. Language in each 
of these sections incorrectly implies that 
the facility PE RVU is lower than or 
equal to the nonfacility PE RVUs. 
However, there are some instances 
where the facility PE RVUs may actually 
be greater than the nonfacility PE RVUs. 
In order to address this inaccuracy, we 
are proposing to revise § 414.22(b)(5)(i) 
(A) and (B) to remove this language.

DISCUSSION’’ at the beginning of your

1. Update 
Section 1848(e)(1)(A) of the Act 
requires us to develop separate 
Geographic Practice Cost Indices

38513 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
(GPCIs) to measure resource cost 
differences among localities compared 
to the national average for each of the 
three fee schedule components (work, 
PE and malpractice). While requiring 
that the PE and malpractice GPCIs 
reflect the full relative cost differences, 
section 1848(e)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act 
requires that the physician work GPCIs 
reflect only one-quarter of the relative 
cost differences compared to the 
national average. 
Section 1848(e)(1)(C) of the Act 
requires us to review and, if necessary, 
adjust the GPCIs at least every 3 years. 
This section also specifies that if more 
than 1 year has elapsed since the last 
GPCI revision, we must phase in the 
adjustment over 2 years, applying only 
one-half of any adjustment in each year. 
As discussed in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
66243), in CY 2008 we established new 
GPCIs for each Medicare locality and 
implemented them. The CY 2008 
adjustment to the GPCIs reflected the 
first year of the 2-year phase-in. 
We note that the proposed CY 2009 
physician work GPCIs do not reflect the 
1.000 floor that was in place during CY 
2006 through June 30, 2008. As 
discussed in section II.S. of this 
preamble, ‘‘Expiring Provisions and 
Related Discussion’’, the 1.000 work 
GPCI floor expired as of January 1, 2008 
in accordance with section 102 of the 
MIEA-TRHCA. However, section 103 of 
the MMSEA extended application of 
1.000 floor to the physician work GPCI 
through June 30, 2008. See Addenda D 
and E for the proposed CY 2009 GPCIs 
and summarized geographic adjustment 
factors (GAFs). 
For a detailed explanation of how the 
GPCI update was developed, see the CY 
2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 66244). 
2. Payment Localities 
a. Background 
As stated above in this section, 
section 1848(e)(1)(A) of the Act requires 
us to develop separate GPCIs to measure 
resource cost differences among 
localities compared to the national 
average for each of the three fee 
schedule components (work, PE, and 
malpractice). Payments under the PFS 
are based on the relative resources 
required to provide services, and are 
adjusted for differences in resource 
costs among payment localities using 
the GPCIs. As a result, PFS payments 
vary between localities. Although the 
PFS payment for a particular service is 
actually adjusted by applying a GPCI to 
each fee schedule component, for 
purposes of discussion and comparison, 
we calculate a geographic adjustment 
factor (GAF) for each locality. These 
GAFs reflect a weighted average of the 
GPCIs within the locality and can be 
used as a general proxy for area practice 
costs. A GAF is calculated to reflect a 
summarization of the GPCIs, (which is 
used only to make comparisons across 
localities). The GAFs are not an absolute 
measure of actual costs, nor are they 
used to calculate PFS payments. Rather, 
they are a tool that can be used as a 
proxy for differences in the cost of 
operating a medical practice among 
various geographic areas (for example 
counties) for the purpose of assessing 
the potential impact of alternative 
locality configurations. 
Prior to 1992, Medicare payments for 
physicians’ services were made on the 
basis of reasonable charges. Payment 
localities were established under the 
reasonable charge system by local 
Medicare carriers based on their 
knowledge of local physician charging 
patterns and economic conditions. A 
total of 210 localities were developed; 
including 22 ‘‘Statewide’’ localities 
where all areas within a State (whether 
urban or rural) received the same 
payment amount for a given service. 
These localities changed little between 
the inception of Medicare in 1966 and 
the beginning of the PFS. Following the 
inception of the PFS, we acknowledged 
that there was no consistent geographic 
basis for these localities and that they 
did not reflect the significant economic 
and demographic changes that had 
taken place since 1966. As a result, a 
study was begun in 1994 which 
culminated in a comprehensive locality 
revision which was implemented in 
1997. 
The 1997 payment locality revision 
was based and built upon the prior 
locality structure. The 22 previously 
existing Statewide localities remained 
Statewide localities. New localities were 
established in the remaining 28 States 
by comparing the area cost differences 
(using the GAFs as a proxy for costs) of 
the localities within these States. We 
ranked the existing localities within 
these States by GAFs in descending 
order. The GAF of the highest locality 
within a State was compared to the 
weighted average GAF of other 
localities. If the differences between 
these GAFs exceeded 5 percent, the 
highest locality remained a distinct 
locality. If the GAFs associated with all 
the localities in a State did not vary by 
at least 5 percent, the State became a 
Statewide locality. If the highest locality 
remained a distinct locality, the process 
was repeated for the second highest 
locality and so on until the variation 
among remaining localities fell below 
the 5 percent threshold. The rest of the 
localities within the State were 
combined into a single rest-of-State 
locality as their costs were relatively 
homogeneous. The revised locality 
structure (which is the one currently in 
use) reduced the number of localities 
from 210 to 89. The number of 
Statewide localities increased from 22 to 
34. The development of the current 
locality structure is described in detail 
in the CY 1997 PFS proposed rule (61 
FR 34615) and the final rule (61 FR 
59494). 
Although there have been no changes 
to the locality structure since 1997, we 
have considered and proposed making 
changes in recent years. As we have 
frequently noted, any changes to the 
locality configuration must be made in 
a budget neutral manner. Therefore, 
changes in localities can lead to 
significant redistributions in payments. 
For many years, we have not considered 
making changes to localities without the 
support of a State Medical Association, 
which we believed would demonstrate 
consensus for the change among the 
professionals who would be affected. 
However, we recognize that over time 
changes in demographics or local 
economic conditions may lead us to 
conduct a more comprehensive 
examination of existing payment 
localities. 
Payment Locality Approaches Discussed 
in the CY 2008 PFS Proposed Rule 
For the past several years, we have 
been involved in discussions with 
California physicians and their 
representatives about recent shifts in 
relative demographics and economic 
conditions among a number of counties 
within the current California payment 
locality structure. In the CY 2008 
proposed rule, we described three 
options for changing the payment 
localities in California. A detailed 
discussion of the options for changing 
the payment localities in California may 
be found in both the CY 2008 PFS 
proposed rule and final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 38139 and 72 
FR 66245, respectively). 
After evaluating the comments on 
these options, which included 
MedPAC’s two suggestions for 
developing changes in payment 
localities for the entire country (not just 
California), other States expressing 
interest in having their payment 
localities reconfigured, and the 
California Medical Association’s 
decision not to endorse any option, we 
decided not to proceed with any of the 
alternatives we presented. We explained 
in the CY 2008 final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 66248) that we intend to

38514 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
conduct a thorough analysis of potential 
approaches to reconfiguring localities 
and would address this issue again in 
future rulemaking. We also noted that 
some commenters wanted us to consider 
a national reconfiguration of localities 
rather than just making changes one 
State at a time. 
b. Alternative Payment Locality 
Approaches 
As a follow-up to the CY 2008 PFS 
final rule with comment period, we 
have contracted with Acumen, LLC to 
conduct a preliminary study of several 
options for revising the payment 
localities. To that end, we are currently 
reviewing several alternative 
approaches for reconfiguring payment 
localities on a nationwide basis. 
However, our study of possible 
alternative payment locality 
configurations is in the early stages of 
development. The discussion that 
follows provides a brief description of 
the alternative payment locality 
configurations currently under 
consideration. An interim report on the 
results of this research will be posted on 
the CMS Web site following the 
publication of this proposed rule. 
At this time, we are not proposing to 
make any changes to our payment 
localities. When we are ready to propose 
a change to the locality configuration, 
we will provide extensive opportunities 
for public comment (for example, town 
hall meetings or open door forums, as 
well as soliciting public comments in a 
proposed rule) before implementing any 
change. If we would make changes to 
the locality structure, we anticipate 
applying any locality reconfiguration 
uniformly to all States. 
Option 1: CMS Core Based Statistical 
Area (CBSA) Payment Locality 
Configuration 
Option 1 would use the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB’s) 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) 
designations for the payment locality 
configuration. MSAs would be 
considered as urban core-based 
statistical areas (CBSAs). Micropolitan 
Areas (as defined by OMB) and rural 
areas would be considered as non-urban 
(rest of State) CBSAs. This approach 
would be consistent with the inpatient 
hospital prospective payment system 
(IPPS) pre-reclassification CBSA 
assignments and with the geographic 
payment adjustments used in other 
payment systems such as ESRD 
facilities, SNFs, ASCs, and home health 
agencies (HHAs). Under this method, 
GPCI payment localities would be 
defined by MSAs (urban CBSAs) and 
‘‘rest of State’’ areas (non-urban CBSAs) 
and the number of localities would 
increase. 
Option 2: Separate High Cost Counties 
From Existing Localities 
This method for reconfiguring 
payment localities was suggested by 
MedPAC as part of its comments on the 
CY 2008 PFS proposed rule. Under this 
approach, we would begin with the 
existing 89 GPCI localities and create 
new localities based on an iterative 
comparison process using the GAF as a 
proxy for costs. (As discussed above, the 
GAF is used as a general proxy for area 
practice costs. The GAFs are used only 
to make comparisons across localities or 
other geographic subdivision and do not 
reflect an absolute measure of costs.) For 
example, the county with the highest 
GAF in a given locality is compared to 
the average GAF for all other counties 
in the locality. If the GAF for the highest 
county exceeds the average GAF for all 
other counties in the locality by more 
than 5 percent, the highest county is 
assigned its own locality. The GAF of 
the second highest county is then 
compared to the average GAF for all 
other remaining counties in the locality. 
If the GAF for the second highest county 
exceeds the average GAF for the other 
remaining counties by more than 5 
percent, the second highest county is 
also assigned its own locality. The 
process is repeated for the next highest 
county(ies) until the difference between 
the GAF for the highest remaining 
county and the average GAF for the 
other remaining counties is less than 5 
percent. This approach is similar to an 
option we presented last year for 
California except that under this option, 
the GAF of higher counties is compared 
to the average GAF of all other 
remaining lower GAF counties, rather 
than to the entire locality’s GAF. As 
such, this approach would remove 
higher cost counties from their existing 
locality structure and they would each 
be placed into their own locality. 
Option 3: Separate MSAs From 
Statewide Localities 
Option 3 was also suggested by 
MedPAC. This alternative for payment 
locality configuration begins with 
Statewide localities (for every State) and 
creates separate localities for higher cost 
(higher GAF) MSAs. Under this 
approach, localities are determined 
within each State based on the same 
iterative process as described above in 
option 2. The GAF of the highest MSA 
in a given State is compared to the 
average GAF of all other areas within 
the State. For example, the highest cost 
MSA would be compared to an average 
GAF for all other MSAs in the State and 
the counties in the ‘‘rest of State’’ area. 
If the GAF of the highest MSA is more 
than 5 percent greater than the average 
GAF for all other areas in that State, 
then the highest MSA becomes a 
separate locality. This iterative process 
continues with the second highest MSA. 
The process stops when the GAF of the 
highest remaining MSA is not more than 
5 percent greater than the average of the 
other remaining areas within the State. 
This option is similar to option 2; 
however, it removes higher cost MSAs 
from the ‘‘rest of State’’ locality rather 
than removing higher cost counties from 
their existing payment locality. 
Option 4: Group Counties Within a State 
Into Locality Tiers Based on Costs 
This approach combines counties 
within a State into tiers (or groupings) 
based on similar GAFs. (This alternative 
is similar to an option we considered for 
California last year). Under this 
approach, counties in each State are 
sorted in descending order by GAFs. 
The highest county GAF is compared to 
the second highest. If the difference is 
less than 5 percent, the counties are 
included in the same locality. The third 
highest county GAF is then compared to 
the highest county GAF. This process 
continues until a county has a GAF 
difference from the highest county GAF 
that is more than 5 percent. When this 
occurs, that county becomes the highest 
county in a new payment locality and 
the process is repeated for all counties 
in the State. This methodology creates 
tiers of counties (within each State) that 
may or may not be contiguous but share 
similar practice costs. 
c. Solicitation of Comments 
As noted earlier in this section, we 
will be posting an interim report of our 
locality study on the CMS Web site after 
publication of this proposed rule. 
Information on how to access the report 
will be made available through the PFS 
home page on the CMS Web site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PhysicianFeeSched/. Additionally, we 
plan to update our Web site periodically 
as our research progresses. 
We encourage interested parties to 
submit comments on the options 
presented both here and in our interim 
report to the address for comments 
listed on our Web site. We are also 
interested in receiving comments and 
suggestions on other potential 
alternative locality configurations (in 
addition to the options described in this 
section). Additionally, we are requesting 
comments on the administrative and 
operational issues associated with the 
various options under consideration. As 
previously discussed, we are not

proposing any changes to the payment 
locality configurations at this time.

changes to the locality configuration, we

any change. 
C. Malpractice RVUs (PC/TC Issue) 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘MALPRACTICE RVUs’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
In the CY 1992 PFS final rule (56 FR 
59527), we described in detail how 
malpractice (MP) RVUs are calculated 
for each physicians’ service and, when 
professional liability insurance (PLI) 
premium data are not available, how we 
crosswalk or assign RVUs to services. 
Following the initial calculation of 
resource-based MP RVUs, the MP RVUs 
are then subject to review by CMS at 5- 
year intervals. Reviewing the MP RVUs 
every 5 years ensures that the MP 
relative values reflect any marketplace 
changes in the physician community’s 
ability to acquire PLI. However, there 
are codes that define certain radiologic 
services that have never been part of the 
MP RVU review process. The MP RVUs 
initially assigned to these codes have 
not been revised because there is a lack 
of suitable data on the cost of PLI for 
technical staff or imaging centers (where 
most of these services are performed). 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38143), we noted that the PLI 
workgroup, a subset of the Relative 
Value Update Committee (RUC) of the 
AMA, brought to our attention the fact 
that there are approximately 600 
services that have technical component 
(TC) MP RVUs that are greater than the 
professional component (PC) MP RVUs. 
Suggesting that it is illogical for the MP 
RVUs for the TC of a service to be higher 
than the MP RVUs for the PC, the PLI 
workgroup requested that we make 
changes to these MP RVUs. 
We responded that we would like to 
develop a resource-based methodology 
for the technical portion of these MP 
RVUs; but that we did not have data to 
support any such change. We asked for 
information about how, and if, 
technicians employed by facilities 
purchase PLI or how their professional 
liability is insured. We also asked for 
comments on what types of PLI are 
carried by facilities that perform these 
technical services. 
In comments submitted in response to 
the proposed rule, the American College 
of Cardiology (ACC) suggested that we 
‘‘flip’’ the MP RVUs between the PCs 
and TCs. This proposal would reduce 
the MP RVUs for the TC and increase 
the MP RVUs for the PC. We also 
received comments from the American 
College of Radiology (ACR) suggesting 
that we make the TC RVUs equal to the 
PC RVUs. The ACR stated that there was 
clearly some professional liability 
associated with these codes and using 
the resource-based MP RVUS of the PC 
maintains the resource-based 
methodology and eliminates the logical 
inequities of the TC having more RVUs 
than the PC. 
The AMA’s PLI workgroup 
recommended that we reduce the MP 
RVUs for the TC for these codes to zero. 
The workgroup suggested that there are 
no identifiable separate costs for 
professional liability for the TC. The 
workgroup also recommended that the 
MP RVUs removed from the TC for 
these codes be redistributed across all 
physicians’ services. 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66248), we 
stated, in response to the suggestions 
from the AMA, ACR, and ACC, that we 
that we did not believe it would be 
appropriate to ‘‘flip’’ the PC and TC MP 
RVU values because the professional 
part of the MP RVUs have undergone a 
resource-based review, are derived from 
actual data, and are consistent with the 
resource-based methodology for PFS 
payments. We also stated that we would 
not simply equalize the PC and TC RVU 
values because we had no data to 
demonstrate that the MP costs for the 
technical portion of these services are 
the same as the professional portion. In 
response to the suggestion of the PLI 
workgroup, we stated that we are not 
able to evaluate whether sufficient data 
exists or to make a judgment on the 
RUC’s assertion that there are no such 
identifiable costs (and therefore, no data 
are available). 
We also received several comments 
supporting our decision to examine the 
possibility of developing a resource- 
based methodology for the technical 
portion of the MP RVUs. The 
commenters supported the collection 
and analysis of appropriate MP 
premium data before making any 
changes to the MP RVU distribution. In 
response, in the CY 2008 PFS final rule 
with comment period, we stated that we 
would continue to solicit, collect, and 
analyze appropriate data on this subject 
and that when we had sufficient 
information we would be better able to 
make a determination as to what, if any, 
changes should be made, and that we 
would propose any changes in future 
rulemaking. 
The issue of assigning MP RVUs for 
the TC of certain services continues to 
be a source of concern for several 
physician associations and for CMS. We 
did not receive a response to our request 
for additional data on this issue. This 
issue is one of importance to CMS 
because the lack of available PLI data 
affects our ability to make a resource- 
based evaluation of the TC MP RVUs for 
these codes. As part of our work to 
update the MP RVUs in CY 2010, we 
will instruct our contractor to research 
available data sources for the MP costs 
associated with the TC portion of these 
codes. We will also ask the contractor to 
look at what is included in general 
liability insurance versus PLI for 
physicians and other professional staff. 
If data sources are available, we will 
instruct the contractor to gather the data 
so we will be ready to implement 
revised MP RVUs for the TC of these 
codes in conjunction with the update of 
MP RVUs for the PCs in 2010. 
D. Medicare Telehealth Services 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘MEDICARE TELEHEALTH 
SERVICES’’ at the beginning of your 
comments.] 
1. Requests for Adding Services to the 
List of Medicare Telehealth Services 
Section 1834(m)(4)(F) of the Act 
defines telehealth services as 
professional consultations, office visits, 
and office psychiatry services, and any 
additional service specified by the 
Secretary. In addition, the statute 
required us to establish a process for 
adding services to or deleting services 
from the list of telehealth services on an 
annual basis. 
In the December 31, 2002 Federal 
Register (67 FR 79988), we established 
a process for adding services to or 
deleting services from the list of 
Medicare telehealth services. This 
process provides the public an ongoing 
opportunity to submit requests for 
adding services. We assign any request 
to make additions to the list of Medicare 
telehealth services to one of the 
following categories: 
• Category #1: Services that are 
similar to professional consultations, 
office visits, and office psychiatry 
services. In reviewing these requests, we 
look for similarities between the 
proposed and existing telehealth 
services for the roles of, and interactions 
among, the beneficiary, the physician 
(or other practitioner) at the distant site 
and, if necessary, the telepresenter. We 
also look for similarities in the 
telecommunications system used to 
deliver the proposed service, for 
example, the use of interactive audio 
and video equipment.

• Category #2: Services that are not 
similar to the current list of telehealth 
services. Our review of these requests 
includes an assessment of whether the 
use of a telecommunications system to 
deliver the service produces similar 
diagnostic findings or therapeutic 
interventions as compared with the 
face-to-face ‘‘hands on’’ delivery of the 
same service. Requestors should submit 
evidence showing that the use of a 
telecommunications system does not 
affect the diagnosis or treatment plan as 
compared to a face-to-face delivery of 
the requested service. 
Since establishing the process, we 
have added the following to the list of 
Medicare telehealth services: 
psychiatric diagnostic interview 
examination; ESRD services with two to 
three visits per month and four or more 
visits per month (although we require at 
least one visit a month to be furnished 
in-person ‘‘hands on’’, by a physician, 
clinical nurse specialist (CNS), nurse 
practitioner (NP), or physician assistant 
(PA) to examine the vascular access 
site); individual medical nutrition 
therapy; and the neurobehavioral status 
exam. 
Requests to add services to the list of 
Medicare telehealth services must be 
submitted and received no later than 
December 31 of each calendar year to be 
considered for the next rulemaking 
cycle. For example, requests submitted 
before the end of CY 2007 are 
considered for the CY 2009 proposed 
rule. For more information on 
submitting a request for an addition to 
the list of Medicare telehealth services, 
visit our Web site at www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
telehealth/. 
2. Submitted Requests for Addition to 
the List of Telehealth Services 
We received the following requests in 
CY 2007 for additional approved 
services to become effective for CY 
2009: (1) Diabetes self-management 
training (DSMT); and (2) critical care 
services. In addition, in the CY 2008 
PFS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 66250), we committed to continuing 
to evaluate last year’s request to add 
subsequent hospital care to the list of 
approved telehealth services. The 
following is a discussion of these 
requests. 
a. Diabetes Self-Management Training 
(DSMT) 
The American Telemedicine 
Association (ATA) and the Marshfield 
Clinic submitted a request to add 
diabetes self-management training 
(DSMT) (as represented by Healthcare 
Common Procedure Coding System 
(HCPCS) codes G0108 and G0109) to the 
list of approved telehealth services. In 
the CY 2006 PFS proposed rule (70 FR 
45787) and final rule with comment 
period (70 FR 70157), we did not 
approve a previous request to add 
DSMT to the list of approved telehealth 
services. We approved a request to add 
individual medical nutrition therapy 
(MNT) to the list of approved telehealth 
services. 
The current request asks us to 
evaluate and approve individual and 
group DSMT as Category 1 services 
because they are comparable to MNT. 
The requesters believe that MNT and 
DSMT are similar because both are 
designed to provide education in the 
primary care setting and to facilitate 
behavior modification on the part of the 
patient. The requesters asked us to 
examine the clinical outcomes of 
providing the service and evidence- 
based practice in determining whether 
the codes should be added to the list of 
approved telehealth services. The 
requesters also asked us to examine 
whether DSMT is appropriate care by 
those standards (clinical outcomes and 
evidence-based practice), and they 
provided evidence that DSMT has a 
direct effect on reducing HbA1c levels 
and improves outcomes for patients. 
CMS Review 
The requesters specifically asked us to 
evaluate DSMT as a Category 1 service 
based on clinical outcomes and 
evidence-based practice. This approach 
does not match the criteria we use to 
assign services to Category 1. To 
determine whether to assign a request to 
Category 1, we look for similarities 
between the service that is being 
considered for addition and existing 
telehealth services for the roles of, and 
interactions among, the beneficiary, the 
physician (or other practitioner) at the 
distant site and, if necessary, the 
telepresenter. Analysis of clinical 
outcomes and evidence-based practice 
alone are not sufficient to assign 
services to Category 1. 
The requesters believe that DSMT 
services can be considered and 
approved for telehealth as Category 1 
services because they are comparable to 
MNT services approved for telehealth. 
Section 414.65 provides for the payment 
of individual MNT furnished via 
telehealth. Group MNT is not an 
approved telehealth service, so it cannot 
be used as a point of comparison for 
group DSMT (as represented by HCPCS 
code G0109). Moreover, as noted in our 
previous review of DSMT, group 
counseling services have a different 
interactive dynamic between the 
physician or practitioner at the distant 
site and beneficiary at the originating 
site as compared to services on the 
current list of Medicare telehealth 
services (70 FR 45787 and 70 FR 70157). 
Since the interactive dynamic of group 
DSMT is not similar to individual MNT 
or any other service currently approved 
for telehealth, we believe that group 
DSMT must be evaluated as a category 
2 service. 
Section 1861(qq) of the Act provides 
that DSMT (which can be either a group 
or individual service) involves 
educational and training services to 
ensure therapy compliance or to provide 
necessary skills and knowledge to 
participate in managing the condition, 
including the skills necessary for the 
self-administration of injectable drugs. 
We believe individual DSMT is not 
analogous to individual MNT because of 
the element of skill-based training that 
is encompassed within individual 
DSMT, but is not an aspect of individual 
MNT (or any other services currently 
approved for telehealth). Due to the 
statutory requirement that DSMT 
services include teaching beneficiaries 
the skills necessary for the self- 
administration of injectable drugs, we 
believe that DSMT, whether provided to 
an individual or a group, must be 
evaluated as a category 2 service. 
Because we consider individual and 
group DSMT to be category 2 services, 
we need to evaluate whether these are 
services for which telehealth can be an 
adequate substitute for a face-to-face 
encounter. Most of the studies cited by 
the requesters focused on the value of 
DSMT in helping individuals with 
diabetes achieve successful health- 
related outcomes. Some of these studies 
documented clinical outcomes and 
evidence-based practice of the 
appropriateness of DSMT in treating 
diabetes, but they did not provide 
comparative analysis demonstrating that 
DSMT provided via telehealth is 
equivalent to the face-to-face delivery of 
such services. As such, these studies 
were not relevant to this review. 
One study cited by the requesters 
which analyzed diabetes care provided 
via telehealth defined telehealth 
technologies to consist of messaging and 
monitoring devices. The telehealth 
technologies utilized in this study do 
not correspond with our definitions of 
telehealth as specified in § 410.78. 
Another study cited by the requesters 
as examining the effectiveness of 
diabetes management provided via 
telehealth was intended to help diabetic 
participants manage their care with the 
help of a home-based telehealth support 
system. The study’s authors note some 
interesting correlations that were 
observed without any claim of 
reliability or validity, and the study’s

authors clearly state that no causal 
relationships can be referred from the 
data. 
A third study cited by the requesters 
compared diabetes education provided 
through telemedicine technology to 
diabetes education provided in-person. 
The study design did not include 
training patients in the self- 
administration of injectable drugs, 
which is one of the elements of DSMT 
under section 1861(qq) of the Act. The 
success of one diabetes educator in 
teaching the self-administration of 
insulin to one of the participants was 
anecdotal; no conclusive evidence was 
provided that insulin administration 
can routinely be taught effectively as a 
telehealth service. 
After reviewing these studies, we 
determined that we do not have 
sufficient comparative analysis or other 
compelling evidence that either 
individual or group DSMT delivered via 
telecommunications is equivalent to 
DSMT delivered face-to-face. We do not 
find evidence that providing DSMT via 
telehealth is an adequate substitute for 
the face-to-face encounter between the 
practitioner and the patient. Therefore, 
we are not proposing to add individual 
and group DSMT (as described by 
HCPCS codes G0108 and G0109) to the 
list of approved telehealth services. 
b. Critical Care Services 
The University of Pittsburgh Medical 
Center (UPMC) submitted a request to 
add critical care services (as defined by 
HCPCS codes 99291 and 99292) as a 
‘‘Category 1’’ service. The requester 
draws similarities to the evaluation and 
management (E/M) consultation services 
currently approved for telehealth. The 
requester noted that the primary 
difference between critical care and 
other E/M services already approved for 
telehealth is that critical care is specific 
to patients with vital organ failure. 
Anecdotally, UPMC has found that the 
use of telecommunications systems and 
software gives critically injured or ill 
patients (specifically stroke patients) 
timely access to highly specialized 
physicians. According to the request, 
UPMC physicians are able to give ‘‘an 
equally effective examination, spend the 
same amount of time with the patient 
and develop the same course of 
treatment just as if they were bedside.’’ 
CMS Review 
The acuity of a critical care patient is 
significantly greater than the acuity 
generally associated with patients 
receiving the E/M services approved for 
telehealth. Because of the acuity of 
critically ill patients, we do not consider 
critical care services similar to any 
services on the current list of Medicare 
telehealth services. Therefore, we 
believe critical care must be evaluated 
as a Category 2 service. 
Because we consider critical care 
services to be Category 2, we need to 
evaluate whether these are services for 
which telehealth can be an adequate 
substitute for a face-to-face encounter. 
We have no evidence suggesting that the 
use of telehealth could be a reasonable 
surrogate for the face-to-face delivery of 
this type of care. As such, we do not 
propose to add critical care services (as 
defined by HCPCS codes 99291 and 
99292) to the list of approved telehealth 
services. 
c. Subsequent hospital care 
Prior to 2006, follow-up inpatient 
consultations (as described by CPT 
codes 99261 through 99263) were 
approved for telehealth. CPT 2006 
deleted the follow-up inpatient 
consultation codes and advised 
practitioners instead to bill for these 
services using the codes for subsequent 
hospital care (as described by CPT codes 
99231 through 99233). For CY 2006, we 
removed the deleted codes for follow-up 
inpatient consultations from the list of 
approved telehealth services. 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38144) and final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 66250), we discussed a 
request we received from the ATA to 
add subsequent hospital care to the list 
of approved telehealth services. Because 
there is currently no method for 
practitioners to bill for follow-up 
inpatient consultations delivered via 
telehealth, the ATA requested that we 
approve use of the subsequent hospital 
care codes to bill follow-up inpatient 
consultations furnished via telehealth, 
as well as to bill for subsequent hospital 
care services furnished via telehealth 
that are related to the ongoing E/M of 
the hospital inpatient (72 FR 66250). 
Since the subsequent hospital care 
codes describe a broader range of 
services than follow-up inpatient 
consultation, including some services 
that may not be appropriate for addition 
to the list of telehealth services, we did 
not add subsequent hospital care to the 
list of approved telehealth services. 
Instead, we committed to continue to 
evaluate whether, and if so, by what 
mechanism subsequent hospital care 
could be approved for telehealth when 
used for follow-up inpatient 
consultations (72 FR 66249). 
CMS Review 
We considered the possibility of 
approving subsequent hospital care for 
telehealth with specific limitations, for 
example, approving subsequent hospital 
care for telehealth only when the codes 
are used for follow-up inpatient 
consultations. Given the potential acuity 
level of the patient in the hospital 
setting, we remain concerned that 
practitioners could misuse the codes 
and provide a broader range of 
subsequent hospital care services via 
telehealth than was formerly approved 
for telehealth with the follow-up 
inpatient consultation codes, including 
the on-going, day-to-day E/M of a 
hospital inpatient. (For a discussion of 
these issues, see 72 FR 38144 and 
66249.) We were also concerned that it 
could be difficult to implement 
sufficient controls and monitoring to 
ensure that the telehealth use of the 
codes for subsequent hospital care is 
limited to the delivery of services that 
were formerly described as follow-up 
inpatient consultations. 
We have considered this issue further, 
and for CY 2009, we are proposing to 
create a new series of HCPCS codes for 
follow-up inpatient telehealth 
consultations. Practitioners would use 
these codes to submit claims to their 
Medicare contractors for payment of 
follow-up inpatient consultations 
provided via telehealth. The new 
HCPCS codes will be limited to the 
range of services included in the scope 
of the previous CPT codes for follow-up 
inpatient consultations, and the 
descriptions will be modified to limit 
the use of such services for telehealth. 
The HCPCS codes will clearly designate 
these as follow-up inpatient 
consultations provided via telehealth, 
and not subsequent hospital care used 
for inpatient visits. Utilization of these 
codes would allow us to provide 
payment for these services, as well as 
enable us to monitor whether the codes 
are used appropriately. We also propose 
to establish the RVUs for these services 
at the same level as the RVUs 
established for subsequent hospital care 
(as described by CPT codes 99231 
through 99233). We believe this is 
appropriate because a physician or 
practitioner furnishing a telehealth 
service is paid an amount equal to the 
amount that would have been paid if the 
service had been furnished without the 
use of a telecommunication system. 
Since physicians and practitioners 
furnishing follow-up inpatient 
consultations in a face-to-face encounter 
must continue to utilize subsequent 
hospital care codes (as described by CPT 
codes 99231 through 99233), we believe 
it is appropriate to set the RVUs for the 
new telehealth G codes at the same level 
as for the subsequent hospital care 
codes. 
As defined below in this section, we 
are proposing to create HCPCS codes

38518 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
specific to the telehealth delivery of 
follow-up inpatient consultations solely 
to re-establish the ability for 
practitioners to provide and bill for 
follow-up inpatient consultations 
delivered via telehealth. These codes are 
intended for use by practitioners serving 
beneficiaries located at qualifying 
originating sites (as defined in § 410.78) 
requiring the consultative input of 
physicians who are not available for a 
face-to-face encounter. These codes are 
not intended to include the ongoing 
E/M of a hospital inpatient. 
Claims for follow-up inpatient 
telehealth consultations will be 
submitted to the contractors that process 
claims for the service area where the 
physician or practitioner who furnishes 
the service is located. Physicians/ 
practitioners must submit the 
appropriate HCPCS procedure code for 
follow-up inpatient telehealth 
consultations along with the ‘‘GT’’ 
modifier (‘‘via interactive audio and 
video telecommunications system’’). By 
coding and billing the ‘‘GT’’ modifier 
with the inpatient follow-up inpatient 
telehealth consultation codes, the 
distant site physician/practitioner 
certifies that the beneficiary was present 
at an eligible originating site when the 
telehealth service was furnished. (See 
the CMS Internet-Only Medicare Claims 
Processing Manual, Pub. 100–04, 
Chapter 15, Section 190.6.1 for 
instructions for submission of 
interactive telehealth claims.) 
In the case of Federal telemedicine 
demonstration programs conducted in 
Alaska or Hawaii, store and forward 
technologies may be used as a substitute 
for an interactive telecommunications 
system. Covered store and forward 
telehealth services are billed with the 
‘‘GQ’’ modifier, ‘‘via asynchronous 
telecommunications system.’’ By using 
the ‘‘GQ’’ modifier, the distant site 
physician/practitioner certifies that the 
asynchronous medical file was collected 
and transmitted to him or her at the 
distant site from a Federal telemedicine 
demonstration project conducted in 
Alaska or Hawaii. (See the CMS 
Internet-Only Medicare Claims 
Processing Manual, Pub. 100–04, 
Chapter 15, Section 190.6.2 for 
instructions for submission of telehealth 
store and forward claims.) 
Follow-Up Inpatient Telehealth 
Consultations Defined 
Follow-up inpatient telehealth 
consultations are consultative visits 
furnished via telehealth to complete an 
initial consultation or subsequent 
consultative visits requested by the 
attending physician. The initial 
inpatient consultation may have been 
provided in person or via telehealth. 
The conditions of payment for follow- 
up inpatient telehealth consultations, 
including qualifying originating sites 
and the types of telecommunications 
systems recognized by Medicare, are 
subject to the provisions of § 410.78. 
Payment for these services is subject to 
the provisions of § 414.65. 
We are proposing to describe follow- 
up inpatient telehealth consultations to 
include monitoring progress, 
recommending management 
modifications, or advising on a new 
plan of care in response to changes in 
the patient’s status. Counseling and 
coordination of care with other 
providers or agencies would be 
included as well, consistent with nature 
of the problem(s) and the patient’s 
needs. The physician or practitioner 
who furnishes the inpatient follow-up 
consultation via telehealth may not be 
the physician of record or the attending 
physician, and the follow-up inpatient 
consultation would be distinct from the 
follow-up care provided by a physician 
of record or the attending physician. If 
a physician consultant has initiated 
treatment at an initial consultation and 
participates thereafter in the patient’s 
ongoing care management, such care 
would not be included in the definition 
of a follow-up inpatient consultation 
and is not appropriate for delivery via 
telehealth. 
Payment for follow-up telehealth 
inpatient consultations would include 
all consultation-related services 
furnished before, during, and after 
communicating with the patient via 
telehealth. Pre-service activities would 
include, but would not be limited to, 
reviewing patient data (for example, 
diagnostic and imaging studies, interim 
lab work) and communicating with 
other professionals or family members. 
Intra-service activities must include at 
least two of the three key elements 
described below for each procedure 
code. Post-service activities would 
include, but would not be limited to, 
completing medical records or other 
documentation and communicating 
results of the consultation and further 
care plans to other health care 
professionals. No additional E/M service 
could be billed for work related to a 
follow-up inpatient telehealth 
consultation. 
Follow-up inpatient telehealth 
consultations could be provided at 
various levels of complexity. To reflect 
this, we propose to establish three 
codes. 
Practitioners taking a problem- 
focused interval history, conducting a 
problem-focused examination, and 
engaging in medical decision-making 
that is straightforward or of low 
complexity, would bill a limited service, 
using HCPCS GXX14. At this level of 
service, practitioners would typically 
spend 15 minutes communicating with 
the patient via telehealth. 
Practitioners taking an expanded 
focused interval history, conducting an 
expanded problem-focused 
examination, and engaging in medical 
decision-making that is of moderate 
complexity, would bill an intermediate 
service using HCPCS GXX15. At this 
level of service, practitioners would 
typically spend 25 minutes 
communicating with the patient via 
telehealth. 
Practitioners taking a detailed interval 
history, conducting a detailed 
examination, and engaging in medical 
decision-making that is of high 
complexity, would bill a complex 
service, using HCPCS GXX16. At this 
level of service, practitioners would 
typically spend 35 minutes or more 
communicating with the patient via 
telehealth. 
We are proposing to establish the 
following HCPCS codes to describe 
follow-up inpatient consultations 
approved for telehealth: 
• GXX14, Follow-up inpatient 
telehealth consultation, limited, 
typically 15 minutes communicating 
with the patient via telehealth. 
• GXX15, Follow-up inpatient 
telehealth consultation, intermediate, 
typically 25 minutes communicating 
with the patient via telehealth. 
• GXX16, Follow-up inpatient 
telehealth consultation, complex, 
typically 35 minutes or more 
communicating with the patient via 
telehealth.

1. Payment for Preadministration- 
Related Services for Intravenous 
Infusion of Immune Globulin 
Immune globulin is a complicated 
biological product that is purified from 
human plasma obtained from human 
plasma donors. Its purification is a 
complex process that occurs along a 
very long timeline, and therefore, only 
a small number of manufacturers 
provide commercially available 
products. In past years, there have been 
issues reported with the supply of 
intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) 
due to numerous factors including 
decreased manufacturing capacity, 
increased usage, more sophisticated

processing steps, and low demand for 
byproducts from IVIG fractionation. 
The Medicare payment rates for IVIG 
products are established through the 
Part B average sales price (ASP) drug 
methodology. Payment for 
administration of the IVIG is made 
separately under the PFS. IVIG 
administration is billed using the CPT 
codes for the first hour and, as needed, 
additional hour CPT infusion codes for 
therapeutic, prophylactic, and 
diagnostic services. 
In addition, a separate payment has 
been made under the PFS and the 
Hospital Outpatient Prospective 
Payment System (OPPS) for IVIG 
preadministration-related services since 
2006. Separate payment for the 
preadministration-related services was 
implemented in 2006 largely because of 
reported instability in the IVIG 
marketplace due, in part, to the 
implementation of the new ASP 
payment methodology for IVIG drugs. 
As discussed in the CY 2006 PFS final 
rule with comment period (70 FR 70219 
through 70220), at that time the IVIG 
marketplace was one in which a 
significant portion of IVIG products 
previously available in CY 2005 were 
being discontinued and other products 
were expected to enter the market over 
the next year. For CY 2006, there were 
only 2 HCPCS codes describing all IVIG 
products based on either lyophilized 
(powdered) or liquid preparation. 
To continue to ensure appropriate 
access to IVIG, in CY 2006 during this 
short-term period of market instability 
for IVIG, we temporarily initiated a 
separate payment to physicians to 
reflect the additional resources that may 
have been associated with locating and 
acquiring adequate IVIG product and 
preparing for an office infusion of IVIG. 
In order to address what was 
considered to be an impermanent period 
of market instability, we created a 
separate G-code, G0332, IVIG 
preadministration-related services for 
intravenous infusion of 
immunoglobulin, per infusion 
encounter. As discussed in the CY 2006 
PFS final rule with comment period, we 
expected the IVIG marketplace to 
stabilize through 2006 and that the 
atypical preadministration-related 
services relating to IVIG would be 
temporary and no longer necessary for 
physicians’ offices that provided IVIG 
infusions to patients. 
However, in the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period (71 FR 
69678), we decided to continue the IVIG 
preadministration-related services 
payment for an additional year to help 
ensure patient access to IVIG. We stated 
in that rule that we were anticipating 
the results of the HHS Office of 
Inspector General (OIG) study on the 
availability and pricing of IVIG before 
changing this policy. In addition, we 
continued to receive comments from 
stakeholders that some beneficiaries 
were experiencing IVIG access issues 
such as delayed treatments and site of 
service shifts. 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38146), we proposed to continue 
payment for G0332 through CY 2008 at 
the same level of PE RVUs as CY 2007. 
We referred to the OIG final report 
published in April 2007 titled, 
‘‘Intravenous Immune Globulin: 
Medicare Payment and Availability’’ 
(OEI–03–05–00404). The OIG had 
conducted this study at the request of 
the Members of the Congressional 
subcommittees on Health within the 
House Energy and Commerce and Ways 
and Means Committees. The OIG 
examined the current state of IVIG 
which included analyzing the payment 
and supply. Specifically, the OIG 
determined whether hospitals and 
physicians could purchase IVIG at 
prices below the Medicare payment 
amounts in 2005 and 2006 and whether 
IVIG was readily available to physicians 
and distributors in 2005 and 2006. 
The OIG found that for the third 
quarter of 2006, just over half of IVIG 
sales to hospitals and physicians were at 
prices below Medicare payment 
amounts. Relative to the previous three 
quarters, this represented a substantial 
increase of the percentage of sales with 
prices below Medicare amounts. During 
the third quarter of 2006, 56 percent of 
IVIG sales to hospitals and over 59 
percent of IVIG sales to physicians by 
the largest three distributors occurred at 
prices below the Medicare payment 
amounts. The findings of the OIG report 
suggest that stability in the IVIG market 
had improved in late 2006. No other 
comprehensive studies have been 
presented to show continued instability 
in market conditions or systematic 
problems with patient access. 
Recent IVIG drug coding revisions 
and reporting have contributed to 
increased payments for IVIG products 
and, we believe, improved market 
stability. Beginning on July 1, 2007, six 
new HCPCS codes for specific IVIG 
products were adopted to implement 
separate payment for these products. 
From July 2007 to April 2008, the 
weighted average increase in payment, 
based on allowed charges by IVIG 
product code, was 2.9 percent for all 
liquid IVIG products and 3.4 percent for 
all IVIG products, both liquid and 
powder. 
IVIG utilization continues to increase. 
National claims history data show 
allowed utilization in physicians’ 
offices (that is, units of IVIG paid) 
increased from slightly over 3,000,000 
units in 2006 to slightly over 3,600,000 
units in 2007. 
We continue to meet with 
representatives of the IVIG industry to 
discuss their concerns regarding the 
pricing of IVIG and Medicare 
beneficiary access to this important 
therapy. No additional studies have 
been published since the OIG report of 
April 2007 on IVIG pricing, supply or 
patient access issues with IVIG. We 
have reviewed national claims data for 
IVIG drug utilization, as well as 
utilization of the preadministration- 
related service codes. This data show 
modest increases in the utilization of 
IVIG drugs and the preadministration- 
related service code which suggests that 
pricing and access may be improving. 
The G-code payment for IVIG 
preadministration-related services was 
intended to be a temporary stopgap 
policy. We continued these temporary 
payments for 3 years because we had 
received reports of market disruptions 
and were concerned about ensuring 
beneficiary access to these drugs. 
However, we now believe that the 
transient market conditions that led us 
to adopt the payment for IVIG 
preadministration-related services have 
improved. Therefore, we are proposing 
to discontinue separate payment for 
IVIG preadministration-related services 
by means of code G0332 furnished on or 
after January 1, 2009. The treatment of 
these services under the OPPS will be 
addressed separately in the OPPS 
proposed rule. 
2. Multiple Procedure Payment 
Reduction for Diagnostic Imaging 
In general, we price diagnostic 
imaging procedures in the following 
three ways: 
• The professional component (PC) 
represents the physician’s interpretation 
(PC-only services are billed with the 26 
modifier). 
• The technical component (TC) 
represents PE and includes clinical staff, 
supplies, and equipment (TC-only 
services are billed with the TC 
modifier). 
• The global service represents both 
PC and TC. 
Effective January 1, 2006, we 
implemented a multiple procedure 
payment reduction (MPPR) on certain 
diagnostic imaging procedures (71 FR 
48982 through 49252 and 71 FR 69624 
through 70251). When two or more 
procedures within one of 11 imaging 
code families are furnished on the same 
patient in a single session, the TC of the 
highest priced procedure is paid at 100

percent and the TC of each subsequent 
procedure is paid at 75 percent (a 25 
percent reduction). The reduction does 
not apply to the PC. 
It is necessary to periodically update 
the list of codes subject to the MPPR to 
reflect new and deleted codes. We are 
proposing to subject several additional 
procedures to the MPPR. Six procedures 
represent codes newly created since the 
MPPR list was established. Four 
additional procedures have been 
identified as similar to procedures 
currently subject to the MPPR. We are 
also removing CPT 76778, a deleted 
code, from the list. Table 3 contains the 
proposed additions to the list. After we 
adopted the MPPR, section 5102 of the 
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 
109–171) (DRA) exempted the 
expenditure reductions resulting from 
this policy from the statutory budget 
neutrality requirement; therefore, we are 
proposing that expenditure reductions 
resulting from these changes be exempt 
from budget neutrality. (See section VI., 
Regulatory Impact Analysis, for a 
discussion of budget neutrality.) The 
complete list of procedures subject to 
the MPPR is in Addendum F of this 
proposed rule.

3. Proposed HCPCS Code for Prostate 
Saturation Biopsies 
Prostate Saturation Biopsy is a 
technique currently described by 
Category III CPT code 0137T, Biopsy, 
prostate, needle, saturation sampling for 
prostate mapping. Typically, this 
service entails 40 to 80 core samples 
taken from the prostate under general 
anesthesia. Currently, the biopsies are 
reviewed by a pathologist and this 
service is captured under CPT code 
88305, Surgical pathology, gross and 
microscopic examination, which is 
separately billed by the physician for 
each core sample taken. CPT Code 
88305 has a physician work value of 
0.75 and a total nonfacility payment rate 
of $102.83. We believe that paying 
individually for review of each core 
sample submitted grossly overpays for 
the pathological interpretation and 
report for this service. 
We are proposing the following four 
G codes to more accurately represent the 
pathologic evaluation, interpretation, 
and report for this service: 
• GXXX1, Surgical pathology, gross 
and microscopic examination for 
prostate needle saturation biopsy 
sampling, 1–20 specimens 
• GXXX2, Surgical pathology, gross 
and microscopic examination for 
prostate needle saturation biopsy 
sampling, 21–40 specimens. 
• GXXX3, Surgical pathology, gross 
and microscopic examination for 
prostate needle saturation biopsy 
sampling, 41–60 specimens. 
• GXXX4, Surgical pathology, gross 
and microscopic examination for 
prostate needle saturation biopsy 
sampling, greater than 60 specimens. 
We are proposing to carrier price 
these codes. We will gather information 
regarding the laboratory and clinical 
staff resources required to value these 
services. 
F. Part B Drug Payment 
1. Average Sales Price (ASP) Issues 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘ASP ISSUES’’ at the beginning 
of your comments.] 
Medicare Part B covers a limited 
number of prescription drugs and 
biologicals. For the purposes of this 
proposed rule, the term ‘‘drugs’’ will 
hereafter refer to both drugs and 
biologicals, unless otherwise specified. 
Medicare Part B covered drugs not paid 
on a cost or prospective payment basis 
generally fall into the following three 
categories: 
• Drugs furnished incident to a 
physician’s service. 
• DME drugs. 
• Drugs specifically covered by 
statute (certain immunosuppressive 
drugs, for example). 
Beginning in CY 2005, the vast 
majority of Medicare Part B drugs not 
paid on a cost or prospective payment 
basis are paid under the ASP 
methodology. The ASP methodology is 
based on data submitted to us quarterly 
by manufacturers. In addition to the 
payment for the drug, Medicare 
currently pays a furnishing fee for blood 
clotting factors, a dispensing fee for 
inhalation drugs, and a supplying fee to 
pharmacies for certain Part B drugs. 
In this section, we discuss recent 
statutory changes to the ASP 
methodology and other drug payment 
issues. 
a. Determining the Payment Amount 
Based on ASP Data 
The methodology for developing 
Medicare drug payment allowances 
based on the manufacturers’ submitted 
ASP data is specified in 42 CFR, part 
414, subpart K. We initially established 
this regulatory text in the CY 2005 PFS

38521 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
final rule with comment period (69 FR 
66424). We further described the 
formula we use to calculate the payment 
amount for each Billing code in the CY 
2006 PFS proposed rule (70 FR 45844) 
and final rule with comment period (70 
FR 70217) With the enactment of the 
MMSEA, the formula we use changed 
beginning April 1, 2008. Section 112(a) 
of the MMSEA requires us to calculate 
payment amounts using a specified 
volume-weighting methodology. In 
addition, section 112(b) of the MMSEA 
sets forth a special rule for determining 
the payment amount for certain 
inhalation drugs. 
For each billing code, we calculate a 
volume-weighted, ASP-based payment 
amount using the ASP data submitted 
by manufacturers. Manufacturers submit 
ASP data to us at the 11-digit National 
Drug Code (NDC) level, including the 
number of units of the 11-digit NDC 
sold and the ASP for those units. We 
determine the number of billing units in 
an NDC based on the amount of drug in 
the package. For example: A 
manufacturer sells a box of 4 vials of a 
drug. Each vial contains 20 milligrams 
(mg). The billing code is per 10 MG. The 
number of billing units in this NDC for 
this billing code is (4 vials × 20 mg)/10 
mg = 8 billable units. 
Prior to April 1, 2008, we used the 
following three-step formula to calculate 
the payment amount for each billing 
code. First, we converted the 
manufacturer’s ASP for each NDC into 
the ASP per billing unit by dividing the 
manufacturer’s ASP for that NDC by the 
number of billing units in that NDC. 
Then, we summed the product of the 
ASP per billing unit and the number of 
units of the 11-digit NDC sold for each 
NDC assigned to the billing code. Then, 
we divided this total by the sum of the 
number of units of the 11-digit NDC 
sold for each NDC assigned to the 
billing code. 
Beginning April 1, 2008, we use a 
two-step formula to calculate the 
payment amount for each billing code. 
We sum the product of the 
manufacturer’s ASP and the number of 
units of the 11-digit NDC sold for each 
NDC assigned to the billing and 
payment code, and then divide this total 
by the sum of the product of the number 
of units of the 11-digit NDC sold and the 
number of billing units in that NDC for 
each NDC assigned to the billing and 
payment code. 
Prior to April 1, 2008, manufacturers’ 
ASP data for smaller and larger package 
sizes were given the same weight in our 
calculation of the payment amounts; 
that is, the ASP for one vial was 
weighted the same as the ASP for a box 
of 10 vials. For payment amounts in 
effect on or after April 1, 2008, 
manufacturers’ ASPs for larger package 
sizes have greater impact on the 
payment amounts and their ASPs for 
smaller package sizes have less; that is, 
the ASP for a box of 10 vials is given 
10 times the weight of a package 
containing a single vial. The payment 
allowance limits published on our Web 
site for dates of service on or after April 
1, 2008 are determined using the new 
volume-weighting methodology and 
include application of the special 
payment rule described in the following 
paragraph. (See our Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
McrPartBDrugAvgSalesPrice/ 
01a_2008aspfiles.asp#TopOfPage.) 
In addition to the formula change, the 
MMSEA established a special payment 
rule for certain inhalation drugs 
furnished through an item of durable 
medical equipment (DME). The 
‘‘grandfathering’’ provision in section 
1847A(c)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act requires 
that certain drugs be treated as multiple 
source drugs for purposes of calculating 
the payment allowance limits. Section 
112(b) of the MMSEA requires that, 
effective April 1, 2008, the payment 
amount for inhalation drugs furnished 
through an item of DME is the lesser of 
the amount determined by applying the 
grandfathering provision or by not 
applying that provision. We reviewed 
our payment determinations effective 
January 1, 2008 to identify the drugs 
subject to this special rule, and 
implemented this new requirement in 
accordance with the statutory 
implementation date of April 1, 2008. 
We identified that albuterol and 
levalbuterol, in both the unit dose and 
concentrated forms, are subject to the 
special payment rule. At this time, we 
have not identified other inhalation 
drugs furnished through an item of DME 
to which section 112(b) of the MMSEA 
applies. 
The provisions in section 112 of the 
MMSEA are self-implementing for 
services on and after April 1, 2008. 
Because of the limited time between 
enactment and the implementation date, 
it was not practical to undertake and 
complete rulemaking on this issue prior 
to implementing the required changes. 
Inclusion of this topic in this proposed 
rule, is our first opportunity to propose 
conforming changes to the regulatory 
text at § 414.904. We propose to revise 
paragraphs (a) and (e) to codify the 
changes to the determination of 
payment amounts as required by section 
112 of the MMSEA. We are soliciting 
comments on the proposed regulatory 
text that appears elsewhere in this 
proposed rule. 
b. Average Manufacturer Price (AMP)/ 
Widely Available Market Prices 
(WAMP) 
Section 1847A(d)(1) of the Act states 
that ‘‘the Inspector General of HHS shall 
conduct studies, which may include 
surveys to determine the widely 
available market prices (WAMP) of 
drugs and biologicals to which this 
section applies, as the Inspector 
General, in consultation with the 
Secretary, determines to be 
appropriate.’’ Section 1847A(d)(2) of the 
Act states that, ‘‘Based upon such 
studies and other data for drugs and 
biologicals, the Inspector General shall 
compare the ASP under this section for 
drugs and biologicals with— 
• The WAMP for such drugs and 
biologicals (if any); and 
• The average manufacturer price 
(AMP) (as determined under section 
1927(k)(1) of the Act for such drugs and 
biologicals.’’ 
Section 1847A(d)(3)(A) of the Act 
states that, ‘‘The Secretary may 
disregard the average sales price (ASP) 
for a drug or biological that exceeds the 
WAMP or the AMP for such drug or 
biological by the applicable threshold 
percentage (as defined in subparagraph 
(B)).’’ The applicable threshold 
percentage is specified in section 
1847A(d)(3)(B)(i) of the Act as 5 percent 
for CY 2005. For CY 2006 and 
subsequent years, section 
1847A(d)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act establishes 
that the applicable threshold percentage 
is ‘‘the percentage applied under this 
subparagraph subject to such 
adjustment as the Secretary may specify 
for the WAMP or the AMP, or both.’’ In 
CY 2006 through CY 2008, we specified 
an applicable threshold percentage of 5 
percent for both the WAMP and AMP. 
We based this decision on the limited 
data available to support a change in the 
current threshold percentage. 
For CY 2009, we propose to specify an 
applicable threshold percentage of 5 
percent for the WAMP and the AMP. At 
present, the OIG is continuing its 
ongoing comparison of both the WAMP 
and the AMP. Furthermore, information 
on how recent changes to the ASP 
weighting methodology may affect the 
comparison of WAMP/AMP to ASP is 
not available at this time. Since we do 
not have data suggesting a more 
appropriate level at this time, we 
believe that continuing the 5 percent 
applicable threshold percentage for both 
the WAMP and AMP is appropriate for 
CY 2009. 
As we noted in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
66259), we understand that there are 
complicated operational issues

associated with potential payment 
substitutions. We will continue to 
proceed cautiously in this area and 
provide stakeholders, particularly 
manufacturers of drugs impacted by 
potential price substitutions, with 
adequate notice of our intentions 
regarding such, including the 
opportunity to provide input with 
regard to the processes for substituting 
the WAMP or the AMP for the ASP. As 
part of our approach, we intend to 
develop a better understanding of the 
issues that may be related to certain 
drugs for which the WAMP and AMP 
may be lower than the ASP over time. 
We welcome comments on our 
proposal to continue the applicable 
threshold at 5 percent for both the 
WAMP and AMP for CY 2009. 
2. Competitive Acquisition Program 
(CAP) Issues 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘CAP ISSUES’’ at the beginning 
of your comments.] 
Section 303(d) of the MMA requires 
the implementation of a competitive 
acquisition program for certain 
Medicare Part B drugs not paid on a cost 
or prospective payment system basis. 
The provisions for acquiring and billing 
drugs under the CAP were described in 
the Competitive Acquisition of 
Outpatient Drugs and Biologicals Under 
Part B proposed rule (March 4, 2005, 70 
FR 10746) and the interim final rule 
(July 6, 2005, 70 FR 39022), and certain 
provisions were finalized in the CY 
2006 PFS final rule with comment 
period (70 FR 70236). The CY 2007 PFS 
final rule with comment period (70 FR 
66260) then finalized portions of the 
July 6, 2005 IFC that had not already 
been finalized. 
The CAP is an alternative to the ASP 
(buy and bill) methodology of obtaining 
certain Part B drugs used incident to 
physicians’ services. Physicians who 
choose to participate in the CAP obtain 
drugs from vendors selected through a 
competitive bidding process and 
approved by CMS. Under the CAP, 
physicians agree to obtain all of the 
approximately 190 drugs on the CAP 
drug list from an approved CAP vendor. 
A vendor retains title to the drug until 
it is administered, bills Medicare for the 
drug, and bills the beneficiary for cost 
sharing amount once the drug has been 
administered. The physician bills 
Medicare only for administering the 
drug to the beneficiary. The CAP 
currently operates with a single CAP 
drug category. CAP claims processing 
began on July 1, 2006. 
After the CAP was implemented, 
section 108 of the MIEA–TRHCA made 
changes to the CAP payment 
methodology. Section 108(a)(2) of the 
MIEA–TRHCA requires the Secretary to 
establish (by program instruction or 
otherwise) a post-payment review 
process (which may include the use of 
statistical sampling) to assure that 
payment is made for a drug or biological 
only if the drug or biological has been 
administered to a beneficiary. The 
Secretary is required to recoup, offset, or 
collect any overpayments. This statutory 
change took effect on April 1, 2007. 
Conforming changes were proposed in 
the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 FR 
38153) and finalized in the CY 2008 PFS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
66260). 
In this section, we are proposing 
several refinements to the CAP 
regarding the annual CAP payment 
amount update mechanism, the 
definition of a CAP physician, the 
restriction on physician transportation 
of CAP drugs, and the dispute 
resolution process. Our proposed 
refinements are based on the operational 
experience we have gained since the 
implementation of the program and we 
believe that they will improve this 
relatively new and growing program. 
Although we are currently evaluating 
bids for CY 2009 through CY 2011 
approved CAP vendor contracts, we do 
not believe that the proposals in this 
rule will conflict with the evaluation of 
bids or the performance of the CAP 
vendor contracts because we do not 
expect these proposals to change the 
way payment is made under the CAP, to 
significantly change how prospective 
vendors are expected to furnish drugs 
under the CAP, or to significantly affect 
the number of participating CAP 
physicians. 
a. Annual CAP Payment Amount 
Update Mechanism 
Payment amounts for drugs furnished 
during the first year of an approved CAP 
vendor’s contract are set through a 
competitive process using bidders’ 
prices and limited by the ASP based 
payment amount. This process was 
described in detail in the July 6, 2005 
IFC (70 FR 39069 through 39078). 
Section 414.906(c) provides for updates 
to an approved CAP vendor’s payment 
amounts based on the vendor’s 
reasonable net acquisition costs (RNAC). 
In the July 6, 2005 IFC, we described 
a two-step process to recompute the 
single price for each drug in the single 
drug category if there is a change in the 
costs reported by a particular vendor. 
We stated that ‘‘we would adjust the bid 
price that the vendor originally 
submitted by the percentage change 
indicated in the cost information that 
the vendor disclosed. Next, we would 
recompute the single price for the drug 
as the median of all of these adjusted 
bid prices’’ (70 FR 39076). The two-step 
process contemplated that there would 
be more than one approved CAP vendor 
at the time prices were to be adjusted 
and that no successful bidders would 
choose not to participate in the CAP. 
However, during the first round of 
CAP contracting after offering more than 
one contract, we entered a contract with 
only one bidder. Thus, during the 2008 
price update calculation process, we 
developed an approach to account for 
the lack of RNAC data for bidders who 
chose not to participate in the CAP. We 
believe that the approach we used to 
adjust prices for the 2008 contract year 
is consistent with § 414.906(c) and with 
the July 6, 2005 IFC because it retains 
a two step calculation based on the 
approved CAP vendors’ RNAC, as well 
as the calculation of a median of 
adjusted bid prices. 
This approach was posted on the 
Approved CAP Vendor page of the CMS 
Web site at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
CompetitiveAcquisforBios/ 
15_Approved_Vendor.asp . The percent 
change in RNAC for 2008 was 
calculated based on data supplied by 
the approved CAP vendor. This percent 
change in RNAC was used as a proxy for 
the percent change in RNAC for 
successful bidders that chose not to 
become approved CAP vendors. 
We are proposing to continue using 
this approach for future CAP payment 
amount updates where the number of 
approved CAP vendors is less than the 
number of successful bidders. We 
would continue to use the average of the 
approved CAP vendor-supplied RNAC 
data as a proxy for data from vendors 
who bid successfully but are not 
participating in the CAP. For example, 
if the payment amounts for the first year 
of a CAP contract are based on five 
successful bidders, but only four have 
signed contracts to supply drugs under 
the CAP (that is, there are four approved 
CAP vendors), only RNAC data 
collected from the four approved CAP 
vendors would be used to calculate the 
percent change in the RNAC. The 
average of the four approved CAP 
vendors’ adjusted payment amounts 
would be used as a proxy for the RNAC 
of the successful bidder that is not 
participating in the CAP. The updated 
CAP payment amount would then be 
calculated as the median of the five data 
points (one data point for each approved 
CAP vendor’s updated payment amount, 
and one data point calculated using the 
average of the approved CAP vendor’s 
RNAC). Similarly, if there were five 
successful bidders but only three chose

38523 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
to become approved CAP vendors, the 
average of the three approved CAP 
vendors’ RNAC would be the proxy for 
the RNAC of the two bidders who did 
not participate. The median of those five 
data points would become the updated 
CAP payment amount. 
We believe this approach would 
provide us with a flexible method for 
updating CAP prices that is consistent 
with our original policy as stated in the 
July 6, 2005 IFC, but that accounts for 
bidders or approved CAP vendors who 
are not participating in the program at 
the time the price updates are 
calculated. This would include bidders 
who choose not to participate at the 
beginning of a contract and those who 
drop out later. Our proposal clarifies the 
approach used to calculate the RNAC 
and does not seek to alter the general 
approach to the payment calculation 
update described in the July 6, 2005 IFC 
and existing regulation text. We 
welcome comments on this approach. 
b. Definition of a CAP Physician 
In the July 6, 2005 IFC, we stated that 
section 1847B of the Act most closely 
describes a system for the provision of 
and the payment for drugs provided 
incident to a physician’s service (70 FR 
39026). In the CY 2006 PFS final rule 
with comment period (70 FR 70258), we 
stated that for the purposes of the CAP, 
a physician includes all practitioners 
that meet the definition of a ‘‘physician’’ 
in section 1861(r) of the Act. This 
definition includes doctors of medicine, 
osteopathy, dental surgery, dental 
medicine, podiatry, and optometry, as 
well as chiropractors. However, this 
definition does not include other health 
care professionals, such as NPs, CNSs, 
and other professions such as PAs who 
may be able to legally prescribe 
medications and enroll in Medicare. 
Our 2005 CAP definition was not 
intended to exclude these practitioners 
who are appropriately billing Medicare 
for legally prescribed medications 
administered in a capacity that would 
be classified as incident to a physician’s 
services if the medications were 
administered by a physician. We are 
concerned that the existing CAP 
definition of a physician is 
unnecessarily restrictive and could 
potentially affect access to the CAP for 
a small segment of providers that should 
be eligible for participation in the CAP 
in situations where they currently bill 
Medicare separately and appropriately. 
Therefore, we are proposing to further 
clarify that, for the purposes of the CAP, 
the definition of a physician includes all 
practitioners that meet the definition of 
a ‘‘physician’’ in section 1861(r) of the 
Act, as well as practitioners (such as 
NPs, CNSs and PAs) described in 
section 1861(s)(2)(K) of the Act and 
other practitioners who legally prescribe 
drugs associated with services under 
section 1861(s) of the Act if those 
services and the associated drugs are 
covered when furnished incident to a 
physician’s service. While we believe 
that most practitioners described in 
section 1861(s)(2)(K) of the Act would 
bill under specific physician provider 
numbers, it is not our intent to exclude 
practitioners who are able to bill 
independently for drugs associated with 
services that are covered when provided 
by a physician and legally authorized to 
be performed. 
Our proposal is specific to the Part B 
Drug CAP and does not affect the 
definition of physician in section 
1861(r) of the Act, or the definition of 
Medical and Other Health Services 
described in section 1861(s) of the Act. 
This proposal also does not seek to 
expand the scope of the CAP beyond 
what has been described in previous 
rules, other than to clarify that a small 
number of providers who are enrolled in 
Medicare, and who legally prescribe 
drugs associated with services under 
section 1861(s) of the Act and can be 
paid by Medicare may elect to 
participate in the CAP if billing 
independently. In short, the CAP 
remains at this time a program that 
provides Part B drugs furnished 
incident to a physician’s services. 
We anticipate that a small number of 
NPs, CNSs, and PAs would be affected 
by the implementation of this proposal. 
We seek comment on how this 
clarification would affect the various 
professions that bill Medicare for drugs 
furnished incident to services that are 
typically provided by a physician. If this 
provision is implemented, we believe 
that the total number of CAP 
participants would not increase by more 
than 1 percent, and we seek comment 
on level of interest associated with the 
implementation of this proposal. 
c. Easing the Restriction on Physician 
Transport of CAP Drugs Between 
Practice Locations 
Although section 1847B(b)(4)(E) of the 
Act provides for the shipment of CAP 
drugs to settings other than a 
participating CAP physician’s office 
under certain conditions, in initially 
implementing the CAP, we did not 
propose to implement the CAP in 
alternative settings. In the July 6, 2005 
IFC (70 FR 39047), we described both 
comments that supported the idea of 
allowing participating CAP physicians 
to transport drugs to multiple office 
locations, and comments that raised 
concerns about the risk of damaging a 
drug that has not been kept under 
appropriate conditions while being 
transported. Specifically, one 
commenter pointed out that a physician 
may have several practice locations. If 
the beneficiary should change his or her 
site of treatment from the one to which 
the vendor originally shipped the drug, 
the physician would need an 
appropriate way of transporting the 
drugs from one location to another. 
Some potential vendors stated that, 
while drugs were being transported to 
an alternate location, spoilage and 
breakage could occur. They expressed 
concern that because the vendor retains 
ownership of the drug until it is 
administered to the beneficiary, they 
could be held liable if the drug 
deteriorates and is administered to the 
beneficiary in substandard condition. 
Ultimately, we implemented the CAP 
with a restriction that CAP drugs be 
shipped directly to the participating 
CAP physician, as stated in 
§ 414.906(a)(4), and that participating 
CAP physicians may not transport CAP 
drugs from one location to another, as 
stated in § 414.908(a)(3)(xii). 
However, we were aware that 
physicians may desire to administer 
drugs in alternative settings. Therefore, 
in the July 6, 2005 IFC, we sought 
comment on how this could be 
accommodated under the CAP in a way 
that addresses the potential vendors’ 
concerns about product integrity and 
damage to the approved CAP vendors’ 
property (70 FR 39048). We discussed 
comments submitted in response to the 
July 6, 2005 IFC in the CY 2008 PFS 
proposed rule (72 FR 38158). Several 
comments suggested either easing or 
removing the restriction on transporting 
drugs to other locations. Commenters 
believed that physicians, particularly 
those who specialize in oncology, and 
their staff are knowledgeable about drug 
stability and handling, and therefore, 
were capable of assuming this 
responsibility. Other commenters 
indicated that transporting the drug to 
another office location may allow for 
flexibility in scheduling patient visits. 
We also received several comments 
discussing the impact of CAP delivery 
times on rural clinics and offices with 
satellite locations. Many of these 
responses discussed how easing the 
restriction on transporting CAP drugs 
between locations would be welcome in 
rural areas and for satellite offices with 
limited hours where personnel may not 
always be available to receive CAP drug 
shipments. 
We also requested comments in the 
CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 FR 
38157) on the potential feasibility of 
easing the restriction on transporting

38524 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
CAP drugs where this is permitted by 
State law and other applicable laws and 
regulations. We asked commenters to 
consider how such a policy could be 
constructed so that the approved CAP 
vendor could retain control over how 
the drugs that it owns are handled. We 
also requested comments on other 
issues that we should take into account 
concerning transportation of CAP drugs 
between the practice locations listed on 
a physician’s CAP election agreement 
form. Additionally, we also solicited 
comments on the following areas for 
consideration in the possible 
development of future proposals: 
• How to structure requirements so 
that drugs are not subjected to 
conditions that will jeopardize their 
integrity, stability or sterility while 
being transported, and steps to keep 
transportation activities consistent with 
all applicable laws and regulations; 
• Whether any agreement allowing 
participating CAP physicians to 
transport CAP drugs to alternate 
practice locations should be voluntary. 
This means that approved CAP vendors 
would not be required to offer such an 
agreement and physicians who 
participate in the CAP would not be 
required to accept such an offer; and 
• Whether such an agreement should 
be documented in writing, and whether 
it is necessary to create any restrictions 
on which CAP drugs could be 
transported. 
We responded to submitted comments 
in the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66268). Several 
comments supported the concept of 
easing the restriction on transporting 
CAP drugs if this could be done safely, 
and if changes were consistent with 
applicable rules, regulations, and within 
the limitations of product stability and 
integrity. The restriction on transporting 
CAP drugs was perceived as a barrier to 
physician participation in the program. 
One commenter stated that elimination 
of the restriction would result in the 
same flexibility as the ASP (buy and 
bill) method of acquiring drugs. Another 
commenter expressed a strong desire to 
implement these changes promptly. 
A few commenters also cautioned us 
to implement appropriate safeguards if 
we chose to ease the transportation 
restriction. One commenter asked that 
the safeguards be available for public 
scrutiny before they are implemented. 
Conversely, other commenters stated 
that the risk of damage to CAP drugs 
would be minimal since a physician and 
his or her staff are knowledgeable about 
a given drug’s stability, handling, and 
transportation requirements. 
We are mindful of the concerns 
expressed by the commenters and are 
now proposing to permit transport of 
CAP drug between a participating CAP 
physician’s practice locations subject to 
voluntary agreements between the 
approved CAP vendor and the 
participating CAP physician. We 
propose that such agreements must 
comply with all applicable State and 
Federal laws and regulations and 
product liability requirements, and be 
documented in writing. 
We would like to reiterate the 
voluntary nature of these proposed 
agreements. Approved CAP vendors 
would not be required to offer and 
participating CAP physicians would not 
be required to accept such agreements 
when selecting an approved CAP 
vendor. An approved CAP vendor may 
not refuse to do business with a 
participating CAP physician because the 
participating CAP physician has 
declined to enter into such an 
agreement with the approved CAP 
vendor. Furthermore, we are not seeking 
to define which CAP drugs may be 
subject to the proposed voluntary 
agreements. In other words, each 
approved CAP vendor could specify 
which CAP drug(s) could be 
transported. 
However, our proposal contains 
certain limitations. In previous 
rulemaking, we have described 
requirements for voluntary agreements 
between approved CAP vendors and 
participating CAP physicians. In the 
July 6, 2005 IFC (70 FR 39050) and the 
CY 2006 PFS final rule (70 FR 70251 
through 70252), we stated that we will 
not dictate the breadth of use or the 
specific obligations contained in 
voluntary arrangements between 
approved CAP vendors and physicians, 
other than to note that they must 
comply with applicable law and to 
prohibit approved CAP vendors from 
coercing participating CAP physicians 
into entering any of these arrangements. 
Parties to such arrangements must also 
ensure that the arrangements do not 
violate the physician self-referral 
(‘‘Stark’’) prohibition (section 1877 of 
the Act), the Federal anti-kickback 
statute (section 1128B(b) of the Act), or 
any other Federal or State law or 
regulation governing billing or claims 
submission. We propose to apply these 
standards to any agreement for the 
transport of CAP drugs. 
We are also particularly concerned 
about opportunities for disruption in the 
drug’s chain of custody and appropriate 
storage and handling conditions that 
may ultimately affect patient care or 
increase the risk of drug theft or 
diversion. Therefore, in order to 
maintain safety and drug integrity in the 
CAP and to protect against the 
fraudulent diversion of CAP drugs, we 
propose that any voluntary agreements 
between an approved CAP vendor and 
a participating CAP physician regarding 
the transportation of CAP drug must 
include requirements that drugs are not 
subjected to conditions that will 
jeopardize their integrity, stability, and/ 
or sterility while being transported. We 
welcome comments on these issues, 
including the identification who may 
transport the drugs, how documentation 
of transportation activities could be 
accomplished, and how the oversight of 
such agreements will be carried out. 
In conclusion, we believe that this 
proposal to ease the restriction on 
transporting CAP drugs between a 
participating CAP physician’s practice 
locations—when agreed upon by the 
participating CAP physician and the 
approved CAP vendor—will make the 
CAP more flexible and ultimately more 
appealing to participating CAP 
physicians. Additionally, we believe 
that this proposal will facilitate the 
participation of CAP physicians who 
have office locations in rural areas and/ 
or have satellite offices with limited 
hours. Moreover, we believe that this 
proposal will promote beneficiary care, 
particularly for beneficiaries who live in 
rural locations. Since physicians would 
be able to transport CAP drugs to 
another office location in accordance 
with a voluntary agreement with their 
approved CAP vendor, beneficiaries 
would have more flexibility in 
scheduling the location of their 
appointments. We invite comments 
about this proposal. 
d. Dispute Resolution Process 
Section 1847B of the Act is generally 
silent with regard to the treatment of 
disputes surrounding the delivery of 
drugs and the denial of drug claims. 
However, section 1847B(b)(2)(A)(ii)(II) 
of the Act does contain a reference to a 
grievance process that is included 
among the quality and service 
requirements that must be met by 
approved CAP vendors. In the July 6, 
2005 IFC (70 FR 39054 through 39058), 
we described the process for the 
resolution of participating CAP 
physicians’ drug quality and service 
complaints and vendors’ complaints 
regarding noncompliant participating 
CAP physicians. We encouraged 
participating CAP physicians, 
beneficiaries, and vendors to use 
informal communication as a first step 
to resolve service-related administration 
issues. However, we recognized that 
certain disputes would require a more 
structured approach, and therefore, we 
established processes under § 414.916 
and § 414.917.

38525 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
1. Termination of CAP Drug Shipments 
to Suspended CAP Physicians 
Section 414.916 provides a 
mechanism for approved CAP vendors 
to address noncompliance problems 
with CAP physicians. As stated at 
§ 414.916(a), ‘‘Cases of an approved CAP 
vendor’s dissatisfaction with denied 
drug claims are resolved through a 
voluntary alternative dispute resolution 
process delivered by the designated 
carrier, and a reconsideration process 
provided by CMS.’’ Once the decision is 
made to suspend a participating CAP 
physician’s CAP election agreement, the 
participating CAP physician will be 
suspended from the CAP as described in 
§ 414.916(b)(3). 
Physicians whose participation in the 
CAP has been suspended are not eligible 
to receive CAP drugs. This is implied in 
§ 414.906(a)(4), which speaks of 
approved CAP vendors providing CAP 
drugs directly to ‘‘[a] participating CAP 
physician.’’ However, we believe that 
the clarity of our dispute resolution 
regulations would be improved if this 
drug delivery issue were stated 
explicitly. Therefore, we are proposing 
to revise § 414.916 to specify that 
approved CAP vendors shall not deliver 
CAP drugs to participating CAP 
physicians whose participation in the 
CAP has suspended after an initial 
determination by CMS. This suspension 
in drug shipment would also apply to 
physicians engaged in the 
reconsideration process outlined in 
§ 414.916(c). We are also making a 
conforming change in the regulation text 
in § 414.914(f)(12). These changes are in 
accord with the underlying intent of 
§ 414.916, namely to provide a 
mechanism for vendors to address 
noncompliance problems with CAP 
physicians, and we believe that these 
changes will increase the clarity of our 
regulations. We note that the 
participating CAP physicians who are 
suspended from participation in the 
CAP will be able to obtain drugs and bill 
for them under the ASP payment system 
provided they have not been excluded 
from participation in Medicare and/or 
their billing privileges have not been 
revoked. We welcome comments about 
this proposal. 
2. Approved CAP Vendor’s Status 
During the Reconsideration Process 
Section 414.917 pertains to the 
dispute resolution process for 
participating CAP physicians. As 
discussed in the July 6, 2005 IFC (70 FR 
39057 through 39058), if a physician 
finds an approved CAP vendor’s service 
or the quality of a CAP drug supplied 
by the approved CAP vendor to be 
unsatisfactory, then the physician may 
address the issues first through the 
approved CAP vendor’s grievance 
process, and second through an 
alternative dispute resolution process 
administered by the designated carrier 
and CMS. In turn, the designated carrier 
would gather information about the 
issue as outlined in § 414.917(b)(2) and 
make a recommendation to CMS on 
whether the approved CAP vendor has 
been meeting the service and quality 
obligations of its CAP contract. We 
would then review and act on that 
recommendation after gathering any 
necessary, additional information from 
the participating CAP physician and 
approved CAP vendor. If we suspend an 
approved CAP vendor’s CAP contract 
for noncompliance or terminate the CAP 
contract in accordance with 
§ 414.914(a), the approved CAP vendor 
may request a reconsideration in 
accordance with § 414.917(c). 
In the July 6, 2005 IFC (70 FR 39058), 
we indicated that the approved CAP 
vendor’s participation in the CAP would 
be suspended while the approved CAP 
vendor’s appeal of our decision is 
pending. This suspended status is also 
implied in § 414.917(c)(9), which states 
that the ‘‘approved CAP vendor may 
resume participation in CAP’’ if the 
final reconsideration determination is 
favorable to the approved CAP vendor. 
In order to improve the clarity of our 
regulations, we propose to indicate that 
the approved CAP vendor’s contract 
will remain suspended during the 
reconsideration period in § 414.917. We 
believe this proposed technical change 
is consistent with basic contracting 
concepts and with our current practices 
for the CAP. We invite comments 
regarding this proposed clarification. 
G. Application of the HPSA Bonus 
Payment 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘HPSA BONUS PAYMENT’’ at 
the beginning of your comments.] 
Section 1833(m) of the Act provides 
for an additional 10 percent bonus 
payment for physicians’ services 
furnished in a year to a covered 
individual in an area that is designated 
as a geographic Health Professional 
Shortage Area (HPSA) as identified by 
the Secretary prior to the beginning of 
such year. The statute indicates that the 
HPSA bonus payment will be made for 
services furnished during a year in areas 
that have been designated as HPSAs 
prior to the beginning of that year. As 
a result, the HPSA bonus payment is 
made for physicians’ services furnished 
in an area designated as of December 31 
of the prior year, even if the area’s 
HPSA designation is removed during 
the current year. However, for 
physicians’ services furnished in areas 
that are designated as geographic HPSAs 
after the beginning of a year, the HPSA 
bonus payment is not made until the 
following year, if the area is still 
designated as of December 31 of that 
year. 
In the CY 2005 PFS final rule with 
comment period (69 FR 66297), we 
stated that determination of zip codes 
for automatic HPSA bonus payment will 
be made on an annual basis and that 
there would be no updates to the zip 
code file during the year. We also stated 
that physicians furnishing covered 
services in ‘‘newly designated’’ HPSAs 
may add a modifier to their Medicare 
claims to collect the HPSA bonus 
payment until our next annual posting 
of zip codes for which automatic 
payment of the bonus will be made. 
In § 414.67, we are proposing to revise 
our regulations to clarify that physicians 
who furnish services in areas that are 
designated as geographic HPSAs as of 
December 31 of the prior year but not 
included on the list of zip codes for 
automated HPSA bonus payments 
should use the AQ modifier to receive 
the HPSA bonus payment. 
H. Provisions Related to Payment for 
Renal Dialysis Services Furnished by 
End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
Facilities 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘ESRD PROVISIONS’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
Since August 1, 1983, payment for 
dialysis services furnished by end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) facilities has been 
based on a composite rate payment 
system that provides a fixed, 
prospectively determined amount per 
dialysis treatment, adjusted for 
geographic differences in area wage 
levels. In accordance with section 
1881(b)(7) of the Act, separate 
composite rates have been established 
for hospital-based and independent 
ESRD facilities. The composite rate is 
designed to cover a package of goods 
and services needed to furnish dialysis 
treatments that include, but not be 
limited to, certain routinely provided 
drugs, laboratory tests, supplies, and 
equipment. Unless specifically included 
in the composite rate, other injectable 
drugs and laboratory tests medically 
necessary for the care of the dialysis 
patient are separately billable. Effective 
on August 1, 1983, the base composite 
rates per treatment were $123 for 
independent ESRD facilities and $127 
for hospital-based ESRD facilities. The 
Congress has enacted a number of

38526 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
adjustments to the composite rate since 
that time. The current 2008 base 
composite rates are $132.49 for 
independent ESRD facilities and 
$136.68 for hospital-based ESRD 
facilities. 
Section 623 of the MMA amended 
section 1881 of the Act to require 
changes to the composite rate payment 
methodology, as well as to the pricing 
methodology for separately billable 
drugs and biologicals furnished by 
ESRD facilities. 
Section 1881(b)(12) of the Act, as 
added by the MMA, requires the 
establishment of a basic case-mix 
adjusted prospective payment system 
(PPS) that include services comprising 
the composite rate and an add-on to the 
composite rate component for the 
difference between current payments for 
separately billed drugs and the revised 
drug pricing specified in the statute. In 
addition, section 1881(b)(12) of the Act 
requires that the composite rate be 
adjusted for a number of patient 
characteristics (case-mix) and section 
1881(b)(12)(D) of the Act gives the 
Secretary discretion to revise the wage 
indices and the urban and rural 
definitions used to develop them. 
Finally, section 1881(b)(12)(E) of the Act 
imposes a budget neutrality (BN) 
adjustment, so that aggregate payments 
under the basic case-mix adjusted 
composite payment system for CY 2005 
equals the aggregate payments for the 
same period if section 1881(b)(12) of the 
Act does not apply. 
Before January 1, 2005, payment to 
both independent and hospital-based 
facilities for the anti-anemia drug, 
erythropoietin (EPO) was established 
under section 1881(b)(11) of the Act at 
$10.00 per 1,000 units. For independent 
ESRD facilities, payment for all other 
separately billable drugs and biologicals 
are based on the lower of actual charges 
or 95 percent of the average wholesale 
price (AWP). Hospital-based ESRD 
facilities were paid based on the 
reasonable cost methodology for 
separately billed drugs and biologicals 
(other than EPO) furnished to dialysis 
patients. Changes to the payment 
methodology for separately billed ESRD 
drugs and biologicals that were 
established by the MMA effective 
January 1, 2005, are described in 
sections II.H.1. and II.H.2. These 
changes affected payments in both CY 
2005 and CY 2006. 
In addition, section 623(f)(1) of the 
MMA directs the Secretary to submit a 
Report to Congress detailing the 
elements and features for the design and 
implementation of a bundled PPS for 
services furnished by ESRD facilities to 
Medicare beneficiaries. This bundled 
PPS is a different way of payment for 
ESRD services since it includes not only 
composite rate services, but could also 
include separately billable drugs 
(including EPO), laboratory tests, and 
other separately billable items into one 
PPS payment rate. The Report to 
Congress was released February 20, 
2008. 
1. CY 2005 Revisions 
In the CY 2005 PFS final rule with 
comment period (69 FR 66319 through 
66334), we implemented section 1881(b) 
of the Act, as amended by section 623 
of the MMA, and revised payments to 
ESRD facilities. These revisions were 
effective January 1, 2005, and included 
implementation of a case-mix adjusted 
payment system that incorporated 
services that comprise the composite 
rate; an update of 1.6 percent to the 
composite rate component of the 
payment system; and a drug add-on 
adjustment of 8.7 percent to the 
composite rate to account for the 
difference between pre-MMA payments 
for separately billable drugs and 
payments based on revised drug pricing 
for 2005 which used acquisition costs. 
Effective April 1, 2005, the CY 2005 PFS 
final rule with comment period also 
implemented case-mix adjustments to 
the composite rate for certain patient 
characteristics (that is, age, low body 
mass index, and body surface area). 
In addition, to implement section 
1881(b)(13) of the Act, we revised 
payments for drugs billed separately by 
independent ESRD facilities, paying for 
the top 10 ESRD drugs based on 
acquisition costs (as determined by the 
OIG) and for other separately billed 
drugs at the average sales price +6 
percent (hereafter referred to as ASP+6 
percent). Hospital-based ESRD facilities 
continued to receive cost-based 
payments for all separately billable 
drugs and biologicals except for EPO 
which was paid based on average 
acquisition costs. 
2. CY 2006 Revisions 
In the CY 2006 PFS final rule with 
comment period (70 FR 70161), we 
implemented additional revisions to 
payments to ESRD facilities under 
section 623 of the MMA. For CY 2006, 
we further revised the drug payment 
methodology applicable to drugs 
furnished by ESRD facilities. All 
separately billed drugs and biologicals 
furnished by both hospital-based and 
independent ESRD facilities are now 
paid based on ASP+6 percent. 
We recalculated the 2005 drug add-on 
adjustment to reflect the difference in 
payments between the pre-MMA AWP 
pricing and the revised pricing based on 
ASP+6 percent. The recalculation did 
not affect the actual add-on adjustment 
applied to payments in 2005, but 
provided an estimate of what the 
adjustment would have been had the 
2006 payment methodology been in 
effect in CY 2005. The drug add-on 
adjustment was then updated to reflect 
the expected growth in expenditures for 
separately billable drugs in CY 2006. 
As of January 1, 2006, we also 
implemented a revised geographic 
adjustment authorized by section 
1881(b)(12) of the Act. As part of that 
change, we— 
• Revised the labor market areas to 
incorporate the Core-Based Statistical 
Area (CBSA) designations established 
by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB); 
• Eliminated the wage index ceiling 
and reduced the floor to 0.8500; and 
• Revised the labor portion of the 
composite rate to which the geographic 
adjustment is applied. 
We also provided a 4-year transition 
from the previous wage-adjusted 
composite rates to the current wage- 
adjusted rates. For CY 2006, 25 percent 
of the payment is based on the revised 
geographic adjustments, and the 
remaining 75 percent of payment is 
based on the old metropolitan statistical 
area-based (MSA-based) payments. 
In addition, section 5106 of the DRA 
provided for a 1.6 percent update to the 
composite rate component of the basic 
case-mix adjusted payment system, 
effective January 1, 2006. As a result, 
the base composite rate was increased to 
$130.40 for independent ESRD facilities 
and $134.53 for hospital-based facilities. 
For 2006, the drug add-on adjustment 
(including the growth update) was 14.5 
percent. 
3. CY 2007 Updates 
In the CY 2007 PFS final rule with 
comment period (71 FR 69681), we 
implemented the following updates to 
the basic case-mix adjusted payment 
system: 
• An update to the wage index 
adjustments to reflect the latest hospital 
wage data, including a BN adjustment of 
1.052818 to the wage index for CY 2007. 
• A method to annually calculate the 
growth update to the drug add-on 
adjustment required by section 
1881(b)(12) of the Act, as well as a 
growth update to the drug add-on 
adjustment of 0.5 percent for CY 2007. 
Therefore, effective January 1, 2007 the 
drug add-on adjustment was increased 
to 15.1 percent. 
In addition, section 103 of the MIEA– 
TRHCA established a 1.6 percent update 
to the composite rate portion of the 
payment system, effective April 1, 2007.

Therefore, the current base composite 
rate is $132.49 for independent facilities 
and $136.68 for hospital-based facilities. 
Also, the effect of this increase in the 
composite rate portion of the payment 
system was a reduction in the drug add- 
on adjustment to 14.9 percent, effective 
April 1, 2007. Since the statutory 
increase only applied to the composite 
rate, this adjustment to the drug add-on 
percent was needed to maintain the 
drug add-on amount constant. 
4. CY 2008 Updates 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66280), we 
implemented the following updates to 
the basic case-mix adjusted payment 
system: 
• A growth update to the drug add-on 
adjustment of 0.5 percent. As a result, 
the drug add-on adjustment to the 
composite payment rate increased from 
14.9 percent to 15.5 percent. 
• An update to the wage index 
adjustments to reflect the latest hospital 
wage data, including a BN adjustment of 
1.055473 to the wage index for CY 2008. 
For CY 2008, consistent with the 
transition blends announced in the CY 
2006 PFS final rule with comment 
period (70 FR 70170), we implemented 
the third year of the transition to the 
CBSA-based wage index. In addition, 
the wage index floor was reduced from 
0.8000 to 0.7500. After applying a BN 
adjustment of 1.055473, the wage index 
floor was 0.7916. 
5. Provisions of This Proposed Rule 
For CY 2009, we are proposing the 
following updates to the composite rate 
payment system: 
• A growth update to the drug add-on 
adjustment to the composite rates; 
• An update to the wage index 
adjustment to reflect the latest available 
wage data, including a revised BN 
adjustment; 
• The completion of the 4-year 
transition from the previous wage- 
adjusted composite rates to the CBSA 
wage-adjusted rates, where payment 
will be based on 100 percent of the 
revised geographic adjustments; and 
• A reduction of the wage index floor 
from 0.7500 to 0.7000. 
a. Proposed Growth Update to the Drug 
Add-on Adjustment to the Composite 
Rates 
Section 623(d) of the MMA added 
section 1881(b)(12)(B)(ii) of the Act 
which requires establishing an add-on 
to the composite rate to account for 
changes in the drug payment 
methodology stemming from enactment 
of the MMA. Section 1881(b)(12)(c) of 
the Act provides that the drug add-on 
must reflect the difference in aggregate 
payments between the revised drug 
payment methodology for separately 
billable ESRD drugs and the AWP 
payment methodology. In 2005, we 
generally paid for ESRD drugs based on 
average acquisition costs. Thus the 
difference from AWP pricing was 
calculated using acquisition costs. 
However, in 2006 when we moved to 
ASP pricing for ESRD drugs, we 
recalculated the difference from AWP 
pricing using ASP prices. 
In addition, section 1881(b)(12)(F) of 
the Act requires that, beginning in CY 
2006, we establish an annual update to 
the drug add-on to reflect estimated 
growth in expenditures for separately 
billable drugs and biologicals furnished 
by ESRD facilities. This growth update 
applies only to the drug add-on portion 
of the case-mix adjusted payment 
system. 
The CY 2008 drug add-on adjustment 
to the composite rate is 15.5 percent. 
The drug add-on adjustment for CY 
2008 incorporates an inflation 
adjustment of 0.5 percent. This 
computation is explained in detail in 
the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66280 through 
66282). 
(i) Estimating Growth in Expenditures 
for Drugs and Biologicals for CY 2009 
Section 1881(b)(12)(F) of the Act 
specifies that the drug add-on update 
must reflect ‘‘the estimated growth in 
expenditures for drugs and biologicals 
(including erythropoietin) that are 
separately billable * * *’’ By referring 
to ‘‘expenditures’’, we stated previously 
that we believe the statute contemplates 
that the update would account for both 
increases in drug prices, as well as 
increases in utilization of those drugs. 
In the CY 2007 PFS final rule with 
comment period (71 FR 69682), we 
established an interim methodology for 
annually estimating the growth in ESRD 
drugs and biological expenditures that 
uses the Producer Price Index (PPI) for 
pharmaceuticals as a proxy for pricing 
growth in conjunction with 2 years of 
ESRD drug data to estimate per patient 
utilization growth. We indicated that 
this methodology would be used to 
update the drug add-on to the composite 
rate until such time that we had 
sufficient ESRD drug expenditure data 
to project the growth in ESRD drug 
expenditure beginning in CY 2010. 
However, upon further 
contemplation, we believe that a better 
interpretation of the statutory reference 
to growth in expenditures contemplates 
that we would consider any change in 
drug pricing or utilization, not only 
increases, as we develop the update to 
the drug add-on adjustment. We have 
completed an analysis of ASP prices for 
ESRD drugs from 2006 through 2008, 
which shows a declining trend in ASP 
pricing for ESRD drugs. Accordingly, we 
are concerned that the use of the PPI as 
a proxy for ESRD drug pricing growth 
may no longer be appropriate. This is 
because the PPI is a general measure for 
all drugs and does not reflect price 
changes specific to ESRD drugs. We 
continue to lack sufficient expenditure 
data for trend analysis purposes. Given 
that we do have sufficient ASP pricing 
information on ESRD drug prices to 
establish a price forecast specific to 
ESRD drugs, and since this forecast is 
based on actual ESRD drug pricing data, 
we believe it is a more accurate measure 
of the price component changes for 
purposes of estimating the growth in 
total expenditures for ESRD drugs for 
2009. Accordingly, for CY 2009, we 
propose revising the interim 
methodology for estimating the growth 
in ESRD drug expenditures by using 
ASP pricing to estimate the price 
component of the update calculation. 
As detailed below in this section, we 
are proposing for CY 2009 to estimate 
price growth using historical ASP 
pricing data for ESRD drugs for CY 2006 
through CY 2008 and to estimate growth 
in per patient utilization of drugs by 
using ESRD facility historical drug 
expenditure data for CY 2006 and CY 
2007. 
(ii) Estimating Growth in ESRD Drug 
Prices 
To estimate price growth we used 
ASP pricing data for the four quarters of 
2006 and 2007, and the two available 
quarters of 2008. We anticipate having 
at least three quarters of 2008 data 
available in time for the final rule. We 
calculated the weighted price change, 
for the original top ten ESRD drugs for 
which we had acquisition pricing, plus 
Aranesp. Tables 4 and 5 show the 
average ASP drug prices and the 2007 
weights used. In CY 2006 and CY 2007 
we calculated a weighted average price 
reduction of 1.8 percent. We also 
calculated a weighted average price 
reduction of 2.1 percent between CY 
2007 and CY 2008. The overall average 
price reduction is 1.9 percent over the 
3-year period, thus, the proposed 
weighted average ESRD drug pricing 
change projected for CY 2009 is a 
reduction of 1.9 percent.

(iii) Estimating Growth in Per Patient 
Drug Utilization 
To isolate and project the growth in 
per patient utilization of ESRD drugs for 
CY 2009, we must remove the 
enrollment and price growth 
components from the historical drug 
expenditure data and consider the 
residual utilization growth. As 
discussed previously in this section, we 
propose to use ESRD facility drug 
expenditure data from CY 2006 and CY 
2007 to estimate per patient utilization 
growth for CY 2009. 
First we had to estimate the total drug 
expenditures for all ESRD facilities. For 
this proposed rule, we used the final CY 
2006 ESRD claims data and the latest 
available CY 2007 ESRD facility claims, 
updated through December 31, 2007 
(that is, claims with dates of service 
from January 1 through December 31, 
2007, that were received, processed, 
paid, and passed to the National Claims 
History File as of December 31, 2007). 
For the CY 2009 PFS final rule, we plan 
to use additional updated CY 2007 
claims with dates of service for the same 
time period. This updated CY 2007 data 
file will include claims received, 
processed, paid, and passed to the 
National Claims History File as of June 
30, 2008. 
While the December 2007 update of 
CY 2007 claims used in this proposed 
rule is the most current available claims 
data, we recognize that it does not 
reflect a complete year, as claims with 
dates of service towards the end of the 
year have not all been processed. To 
more accurately estimate the update to 
the drug add-on, aggregate drug 
expenditures are required. Based on an 
analysis of the 2006 claims data, we 
inflated the CY 2007 drug expenditures 
to estimate the June 30, 2008 update of 
the 2007 claims file. We used the 
relationship between the December 
2006 and the June 2007 versions of 2006 
claims to estimate the more complete 
2007 claims available in June 2008 and 
applied that ratio to the 2007 claims 
data from the December 2007 claims 
file. We did this separately for EPO, the 
other top 10 separately billable drugs, 
and the remaining separately billable 
drugs for independent and hospital- 
based ESRD facilities. We are using the 
top 11 drugs since they represent 99.7 
percent of total expenditures in CY 2007 
for separately billable drugs furnished to 
ESRD patients. All components were 
then combined to estimate aggregate CY 
2007 ESRD drug expenditures. The net 
adjustment to the CY 2007 claims data 
was an increase of 12.6 percent to the 
2007 expenditure data. This adjustment 
allows us to more accurately compare 
the 2006 and 2007 data to estimate 
utilization growth. 
The next step is to remove the 
enrollment and price growth 
components from that total. As 
discussed previously in this section, in 
developing the per patient utilization 
growth for this proposed rule, we 
limited our analysis to the latest 2 years 
of available ESRD facility drug data (that 
is, 2006 and 2007). We believe that per 
patient utilization growth between these 
years would be a better proxy for future 
growth, as it best represents current 
utilization trends. 
To calculate the per patient utilization 
growth, we removed the enrollment 
component by using the growth in 
enrollment data between CY 2006 and 
CY 2007. This was approximately 3 
percent. To remove the price effect we 
used the calculated weighted change 
between CY 2006 and CY 2007 ASP 
pricing for the top eleven ESRD drugs. 
We weighted the differences using 2007 
ESRD facility drug expenditure data. 
Table 4 shows the CY 2007 weights for 
each of the top eleven ESRD drugs 
billed by ESRD facilities. 
This process led to an overall 1.8 
percent reduction in price between CY 
2006 and CY 2007. 
After removing the enrollment and 
price effects from the expenditure data, 
the residual growth would reflect the 
per patient utilization growth. To do 
this, we divided the product of the 
enrollment growth of 3 percent (1.03) 
and the price reduction of 1.8 percent 
(1.00 ¥ 0.018 = 0.982) into the total 
drug expenditure change between 2006 
and 2007 of 0 percent (1.00 ¥ 0.00 = 
1.00). The result is a utilization factor 
equal to 0.99 (1.00/(1.03 * 0.982) = 
0.99). 
Since we observed a 1 percent drop in 
per patient utilization of drugs between 
2006 and 2007, we are projecting a 1 
percent drop in per patient utilization 
for ESRD facilities in CY 2009. 
b. Applying the Proposed Growth 
Update to the Drug Add-on Adjustment 
In CY 2006, we applied the projected 
growth update percentage to the total 
amount of drug add-on dollars 
established for CY 2005 to establish a 
dollar amount for the CY 2006 growth 
update. In addition, we projected the 
growth in dialysis treatments for CY 
2006 based on the projected growth in 
ESRD enrollment. We divided the 
projected total dialysis treatments for 
CY 2006 into the projected dollar 
amount of the CY 2006 growth to 
develop the per treatment growth 
update amount. This growth update 
amount, combined with the CY 2005 per 
treatment drug add-on amount, resulted 
in an average drug add-on amount per 
treatment of $18.88 (or a 14.5 percent 
adjustment to the composite rate) for CY 
2006. 
In the CY 2007 PFS final rule with 
comment period (71 FR 69684), we

38529 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
revised our update methodology by 
applying the growth update to the per 
treatment drug add-on amount. That is, 
for CY 2007, we applied the growth 
update factor of 4.03 percent to the 
$18.88 per treatment drug add-on 
amount for an updated amount of 
$19.64 per treatment (71 FR 69684). For 
CY 2008, the per treatment drug add-on 
amount was updated to $20.33. 
As discussed in detail below, for CY 
2009, we are proposing no update to the 
per treatment drug add-on amount of 
$20.33 established in CY 2008. 
c. Proposed Update to the Drug Add-on 
Adjustment 
As discussed previously in this 
section, we estimate a 1 percent 
reduction in per patient utilization of 
ESRD drugs for CY 2009. Also, using 
historical ESRD drug pricing data 
specific to ESRD drugs, we project a 1.9 
percent reduction in ESRD drug prices 
for CY 2009. To compute this estimate, 
we used ASP pricing data for the four 
quarters of 2006 and 2007, and the two 
available quarters of 2008. We 
calculated the weighted price change for 
the top ten ESRD drugs plus Aranesp 
over the period. Tables 4 and 5 show the 
average ASP drug prices and the 2007 
weights used. As shown in Table 4, to 
the extent there were price changes 
during the trending period, increases as 
well as decreases have been reflected in 
the overall weighted average price 
reduction of 1.9 percent over the 3-year 
period. Had we continued to use the PPI 
for prescription drugs in our 
computation of the drug add-on update, 
the price component would have been 
a projected increase of 3.8 percent. 
Given the observed decline in ASP 
pricing for ESRD drugs, we believe the 
continued use of the PPI as a price 
proxy would have significantly 
overstated the price component of our 
computation of the projected change in 
per patient ESRD drug expenditures for 
CY 2009. This is because the PPI is a 
more general measure of price change 
for all drugs and does not reflect price 
changes specific to the drugs provided 
by ESRD facilities. 
Therefore, we are projecting that the 
combined growth in per patient 
utilization and pricing for CY 2009 
would result in a negative update equal 
to ¥2.9 percent. (0.99 * 0.981 = 0.971). 
However, as indicated above, we are 
proposing no update to the drug add-on 
adjustment. 
We believe this approach is consistent 
with the language under section 
1881(b)(12)(F) of the Act which states in 
part that ‘‘the Secretary shall annually 
increase’’ the drug add-on amount based 
on the growth in expenditures for 
separately billed ESRD drugs. Our 
understanding of the statute 
contemplates ‘‘annually increase’’ to 
mean a positive or zero update to the 
drug add-on. Therefore, we propose to 
apply a zero update and to maintain the 
$20.33 per treatment drug add-on 
amount for CY 2009 that reflects a 
proposed 15.5 percent drug add-on 
adjustment to the composite rate for CY 
2009. 
However, we also believe that an 
alternative reading of the statute is 
possible. We believe that the Congress 
may not have intended to provide an 
increase in the drug add-on adjustment 
in a year where the projected growth in 
expenditures for separately billable 
ESRD drugs is declining. There is 
potentially a gap in the statute, which 
specifies an ‘‘increase’’ to the drug add- 
on adjustment based upon the 
‘‘estimated growth in expenditures for 
drugs and biologicals’’ that are 
separately billed ESRD drugs. However, 
an ‘‘increase’’ cannot be implemented 
when estimated ‘‘growth’’ is negative. 
To resolve this seeming contradiction, 
another approach to the zero percent 
update that we are proposing would be 
to apply an adjustment of less than 1.0 
to the drug add-on adjustment. Under 
this approach, for CY 2009, we would 
‘‘increase’’ the drug add-on adjustment 
by 0.971. Applying the 0.971 increase to 
the $20.33 per treatment adjustment 
would yield a drug add-on amount of 
$19.74 per treatment, which represents 
a 0.4 percent decrease in the CY 2008 
drug add-on percentage of 15.5 percent. 
As such, the proposed drug add-on 
adjustment to the composite rate for CY 
2009 would be 15.0 percent. 
We are seeking public comment on 
our proposal of a zero update, as well 
as the alternative approach presented 
above, so that we can make an informed 
decision with respect to the final update 
to the CY 2009 drug add-on adjustment 
to the composite rate. 
Had we selected the other option of 
continuing to use the PPI for 
prescription drugs as a proxy for ESRD 
drug prices instead of using ASP pricing 
data, the resulting update factor would 
have been a 2.6 percent increase to the 
CY 2008 average per treatment drug 
add-on amount of $20.33, resulting in a 
weighted average increase to the 
composite rate of $0.57 or a 0.4 percent 
increase in the CY 2008 drug add-on 
percentage of 15.5 percent. As discussed 
above, however, we believe the PPI 
overstates the changes in ESRD drug 
prices given the observed trend in 
declining prices for those drugs over the 
past several years. 
We note that for the CY 2010 update 
to the drug add-on adjustment we 
expect to estimate the growth in ESRD 
drug expenditures using 3 years’ worth 
of ASP-based historical ESRD drug 
expenditure data that will be available 
at that time. This data will be used to 
conduct a trend analysis to estimate the 
growth in ESRD drug expenditures for 
CY 2010. As we discussed earlier with 
respect to computing the 2009 estimated 
growth in drug prices, to the extent 
there are price changes during the 
trending period, past increases as well 
as decreases would be reflected in 
future trend analyses and in future 
updates to the drug add-on adjustment. 
d. Proposed Update to the Geographic 
Adjustments to the Composite Rates 
Section 1881(b)(12)(D) of the Act, as 
amended by section 623(d) of the MMA, 
gives the Secretary the authority to 
revise the wage indexes previously 
applied to the ESRD composite rates. 
The purpose of the wage index is to 
adjust the composite rates for differing 
wage levels covering the areas in which 
ESRD facilities are located. The wage 
indexes are calculated for each urban 
and rural area. In the CY 2006 PFS final 
rule with comment period (70 FR 
70167), we announced our adoption of 
the OMB CBSA-based geographic area 
designations to develop revised urban/ 
rural definitions and corresponding 
wage index values for purposes of 
calculating ESRD composite rates. In 
addition, we generally have followed 
wage index policies related to these 
definitions as used under the inpatient 
hospital prospective payment system 
(IPPS), but without regard to any 
approved geographic reclassification 
authorized under sections 1886(d)(8) 
and (d)(10) of the Act or other 
provisions that only apply to hospitals 
paid under the IPPS (70 FR 70167). For 
purposes of the ESRD wage index 
methodology, the hospital wage data we 
use is pre-classified, pre-floor hospital 
data and unadjusted for occupational 
mix. 
i. Updates to Core-Based Statistical Area 
(CBSA) Definitions 
In the CY 2006 PFS final rule with 
comment period (70 FR 70167), we 
announced our adoption of the OMB’s 
CBSA-based geographic area 
designations to develop revised urban/ 
rural definitions and corresponding 
wage index values for purposes of 
calculating ESRD composite rates. 
OMB’s CBSA-based geographic area 
designations are described in OMB 
Bulletin 03–04, originally issued June 6, 
2003, and is available online at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/ 
b03-04.html. In addition, OMB has 
published subsequent bulletins

38530 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
regarding CBSA changes, including 
changes in CBSA numbers and titles. 
We wish to point out that this and all 
subsequent ESRD rules and notices are 
considered to incorporate the CBSA 
changes published in the most recent 
OMB bulletin that applies to the 
hospital wage index used to determine 
the current ESRD wage index. The OMB 
bulletins may be accessed online at 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ 
bulletins/index.html. 
ii. Updated Wage Index Values 
In the CY 2007 PFS final rule with 
comment period (71 FR 69685), we 
stated that we intended to update the 
ESRD wage index values annually. The 
current ESRD wage index values for CY 
2008 were developed from FY 2004 
wage and employment data obtained 
from the Medicare hospital cost reports. 
As we indicated, the ESRD wage index 
values are calculated without regard to 
geographic classifications authorized 
under sections 1886(d)(8) and (d)(10) of 
the Act and utilize pre-floor hospital 
data that is unadjusted for occupational 
mix. To calculate the ESRD wage index, 
hospital wage index data for FY 2004 for 
all providers in each urban/rural 
geographic area are combined. The sum 
of the wages for all providers in each 
geographic area was divided by the total 
hours for all providers in each area. The 
result is the average hourly hospital 
wage for that geographic locale. The 
ESRD wage index was computed by 
dividing the average hourly hospital 
wage for each geographic area by the 
national average hourly hospital wage. 
The final step was to multiply each 
wage index value by the ESRD wage 
index budget neutrality factor. 
We propose to use the same 
methodology for CY 2009, with the 
exception that FY 2005 hospital data 
will be used to develop the CY 2009 
wage index values. The CY 2009 ESRD 
wage index budget neutrality factor is 
1.056672. (See section H.5.d.iii. of this 
proposed rule for details about this 
adjustment.) For a detailed description 
of the development of the proposed CY 
2009 wage index values based on FY 
2005 hospital data, see the FY 2009 
‘‘Proposed Changes to the Hospital 
Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems 
(IPPS) and Fiscal Year 2009 Rates’’ 
proposed rule (73 FR 23630). Section III 
G. (Computation of the Proposed FY 
2009 Unadjusted Wage Index) of the 
preamble to that proposed rule 
describes the cost report schedules, line 
items, data elements, adjustments, and 
wage index computations. The wage 
index data affecting ESRD composite 
rates for each urban and rural locale 
may also be accessed on the CMS Web 
site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS/WIFN/list.asp. The 
wage data are located in the section 
entitled, ‘‘FY 2009 Proposed Rule 
Occupational Mix Adjusted and 
Unadjusted Average Hourly Wage and 
Pre-reclassified Wage Index by CBSA.’’ 
(A) Fourth Year of the Transition 
In the CY 2006 PFS final rule with 
comment period (70 FR 70169), we 
indicated that we would apply a 4-year 
transition period to mitigate the impact 
on the composite rates resulting from 
our adoption of CBSA-based geographic 
designations. Beginning January 1, 2006, 
during each year of the transition, an 
ESRD facility’s wage-adjusted composite 
rate (that is, without regard to any case- 
mix adjustments) is a blend of its old 
MSA-based wage-adjusted payment rate 
and its new CBSA-based wage adjusted 
payment rate for the transition year 
involved. For each transition year, the 
share of the blended wage-adjusted base 
payment rate that is derived from the 
MSA-based and CBSA-based wage 
index values is shown in Table 6. In CY 
2006, the first year of the transition, we 
implemented a 75/25 blend. In CY 2007, 
the second year of the transition, we 
implemented a 50/50 blend. In CY 2008, 
the third year of the transition, we 
implemented a 25/75 blend. Consistent 
with the transition blends announced in 
the CY 2006 PFS final rule with 
comment period (70 FR 70170), in CY 
2009, we are proposing that each ESRD 
facility’s composite payment rate will be 
based entirely on the CBSA-based wage 
index. 
In CY 2006, we eliminated the wage 
index cap of 1.30 and stated that we 
would implement a gradual reduction in 
the wage index floor of 0.90. Prior to 
January 1, 2006, the wage indexes were 
restricted to values no less than 0.90 
and no greater than 1.30, meaning that 
payments to facilities in areas where 
labor costs fell below 90 percent of the 
national average, or exceeded 130 
percent of that average, were not 
adjusted beyond the 90 percent or 130 
percent level. Although we stated that 
the ESRD wage index values should not 
be constrained by the application of 
floors and ceilings, we also expressed 
concern that the immediate elimination 
of the floor could adversely affect ESRD 
beneficiary access to care. Therefore, we 
reduced the floor to 0.85 in CY 2006, to 
0.80 in CY 2007, and to 0.75 in CY 2008. 
For CY 2009, we are proposing to 
reduce the wage index floor to 0.70. For 
this final year of the transition (CY 
2009), we believe that a reduction to 
0.70 is appropriate as we continue to 
reassess the need for a wage index floor 
in future years. We believe that a 
gradual reduction in the floor is still 
needed to ensure patient access to 
dialysis in areas that have low wage 
index values, especially Puerto Rico, 
and to prevent sudden adverse effects to 
the payment system. However, we note 
that our goal is the eventual elimination 
of all wage index floors. 
The wage index floors, caps, and 
blended shares of the composite rates 
applicable to all ESRD facilities for CY 
2006 through CY 2008, and the 
proposed floor and blended share 
applicable for CY 2009, are shown in 
Table 6. They are identical to the values 
shown in Table 10 of the CY 2007 PFS 
final rule with comment period (71 FR 
69686) for the applicable years.

Because CY 2009 is the final year of 
the 4-year transition period, each ESRD 
facility’s composite payment rate will be 
based entirely on its applicable new 
CBSA-based wage index value. 
(B) Wage Index Values for Areas With 
No Hospital Data 
In CY 2006, while adopting the CBSA 
designations, we identified a small 
number of ESRD facilities in both urban 
and rural geographic areas where there 
are no hospital wage data from which to 
calculate ESRD wage index values. The 
affected areas were rural Massachusetts, 
rural Puerto Rico, and the urban area of 
Hinesville, GA (CBSA 25980). For CY 
2006, CY 2007, and CY 2008, we 
calculated the ESRD wage index values 
for those areas as follows: 
• For rural Massachusetts, because 
we had not determined a reasonable 
wage proxy, we used the FY 2005 wage 
index value in CY 2006 and CY 2007. 
• For rural Puerto Rico, the situation 
was similar to rural Massachusetts. 
However, because all geographic areas 
in Puerto Rico were subject to the wage 
index floor in CY 2006, CY 2007, and 
CY 2008, we applied the ESRD wage 
index floor to rural Puerto Rico as well. 
• For the urban area of Hinesville, 
GA, we calculated the CY 2006, CY 
2007, and CY 2008 wage index value 
based on the average wage index value 
for all urban areas within the State of 
Georgia. 
For CY 2008, we adopted an 
alternative methodology for establishing 
a wage index value for rural 
Massachusetts. Because we used the 
same wage index value for 2 years with 
no update, we believed it was 
appropriate to establish a methodology 
which employed reasonable proxy data 
for rural areas (including rural 
Massachusetts) and also permitted 
annual updates to the wage index based 
on that proxy data. For rural areas 
without hospital wage data, we used the 
average wage index values from all 
contiguous CBSAs as a reasonable proxy 
for that rural area. 
In determining the imputed rural 
wage index, we interpreted the term 
‘‘contiguous’’ to mean sharing a border. 
In the case of Massachusetts, the entire 
rural area consists of Dukes and 
Nantucket Counties. We determined 
that the borders of Dukes and Nantucket 
counties are contiguous with Barnstable 
and Bristol counties. We are proposing 
to use the same methodology for CY 
2009. Under this methodology, the CY 
2009 proposed wage index values for 
the counties of Barnstable (CBSA 12700, 
Barnstable Town, MA–1.2624) and 
Bristol (CBSA 39300, Providence-New 
Bedford-Fall River, RI–MA–1.0573) 
were averaged resulting in an imputed 
proposed wage index value of 1.1599 for 
rural Massachusetts in CY 2009. 
For rural Puerto Rico, we continued to 
apply the wage index floor in CY 2008. 
Because all areas in Puerto Rico that 
have a wage index were eligible for the 
ESRD wage index floor of 0.75, we 
applied that floor to ESRD facilities 
located in rural Puerto Rico. For CY 
2009, all areas in Puerto Rico that have 
a wage index are eligible for the 
proposed ESRD wage index floor of 
0.70. Therefore, we propose to continue 
applying the proposed ESRD wage 
index floor of 0.70 to facilities that are 
located in rural Puerto Rico. 
For Hinesville, GA (CBSA 25980), 
which is an urban area without specific 
hospital wage data, we propose to apply 
the same methodology used to impute a 
wage index value that we used in CY 
2006, CY 2007, and CY 2008. 
Specifically, we utilize the average wage 
index value for all urban areas within 
the State of Georgia. That results in a 
proposed CY 2009 wage index value of 
0.9123 for the Hinesville-Fort Stewart 
GA CBSA. 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66283), we 
stated that we would continue to 
evaluate existing hospital wage data and 
possibly wage data from other sources 
such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
to determine if other methodologies 
might be appropriate for imputing wage 
index values for areas without hospital 
wage data for CY 2009 and subsequent 
years. To date, no data from other 
sources, superior to that currently used 
in connection with the IPPS wage index 
has emerged. Therefore, for ESRD 
purposes, we continue to believe this is 
an appropriate policy. 
(C) Evaluation of Wage Index Policies 
Adopted in the FY 2008 IPPS Final Rule 
We also stated that we planned to 
evaluate any policies adopted in the FY 
2008 IPPS final rule (72 FR 47130, 
47337 through 47338) that affect the 
wage index, including how we treat 
certain New England hospitals under 
section 601(g) of the Social Security 
Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98–21). 
This is relevant for the ESRD composite 
payment system, because the ESRD 
wage index is calculated using the same 
urban/rural classification system and 
computation methodology applicable 
under the IPPS, except that it is not 
adjusted for occupational mix and does 
not reflect geographic classifications 
authorized under sections 1886(d)(8) 
and (d)(12) of the Act. We use the 
hospital wage index with this 
modification because it is the best 
available measure effective of urban and 
rural differences in labor costs among 
dialysis facilities. Accordingly, in the 
following sections, we summarize the 
wage index changes implemented in 
connection with the IPPS, as they affect 
the ESRD wage index used under the 
composite payment system. 
(1) CY 2009 Classification of Certain 
New England Counties 
We are addressing the change in the 
treatment of ‘‘New England deemed 
counties’’ (that is, those counties in New 
England listed in § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(B) 
that were deemed to be part of urban 
areas under section 601(g) of the Social 
Security Amendments of 1983), that 
were made in the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 47337 
through 47338). These counties include 
the following: Litchfield County, 
Connecticut; York County, Maine; 
Sagadahoc County, Maine; Merrimack 
County, New Hampshire; and Newport 
County, Rhode Island. Of these five 
‘‘New England deemed counties’’, three 
(York County, Sagadahoc County, and 
Newport County) are also included in 
the MSAs defined by OMB, and 
therefore, used in the calculations of the 
urban hospital wage index values 
reflected in the ESRD composite 
payment rates. The remaining two, 
Litchfield County and Merrimack 
County, are geographically located in 
areas that are considered ‘‘rural’’ under 
the current IPPS and ESRD composite 
payment system labor market 
definitions, but have been previously 
deemed urban under the IPPS in certain 
circumstances, as discussed below. 
In the FY 2008 IPPS final rule with 
comment period, for purposes of IPPS, 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(B) was revised such 
that the two ‘‘New England deemed 
counties’’ that are still considered rural 
under the OMB definitions (Litchfield 
County, CT and Merrimack County, NH) 
are no longer considered urban effective 
for discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 2007, and therefore, are 
considered rural in accordance with 
§ 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C). However, for 
purposes of payment under the IPPS, 
acute-care hospitals located within 
those areas are treated as being 
reclassified to their deemed urban areas 
effective for discharges occurring on or 
after October 1, 2007 (see 72 FR 473337 
through 47338). We note that the ESRD 
composite payment system does not 
provide for such geographic 
reclassification. Also, in the FY 2008 
IPPS final rule with comment period (72 
FR 47338), we explained that we have 
limited this policy change for the ‘‘New 
England deemed counties’’ only to IPPS 
hospitals, and any change to non-IPPS 
provider wage indexes would be

38532 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
addressed in the respective payment 
system rules. Accordingly, we are taking 
this opportunity to clarify the treatment 
of ‘‘New England deemed counties’’ 
under the ESRD composite payment 
system in this proposed rule. 
As discussed above, for purposes of 
the ESRD wage index, we have 
recognized the OMB’s CBSA 
designations, as well as generally 
following the policies under IPPS with 
regard to the definitions for ‘‘urban’’ and 
‘‘rural’’ for the wage index. Historical 
changes to the labor market area/ 
geographic classifications and annual 
updates to the wage index values under 
the composite payment system are made 
effective January 1 each year. When we 
established the most recent composite 
payment system update, effective for 
dialysis services provided on or after 
January 1, 2008, we considered the 
‘‘New England deemed counties’’ 
(including Litchfield County, CT and 
Merrimack County, NH) as urban for CY 
2008, as evidenced by the inclusion of 
Litchfield County as one of the 
constituent counties of urban CBSA 
25540 (Hartford-West Hartford-East 
Hartford, CT), and the inclusion of 
Merrimack County as one of the 
constituent counties of urban CBSA 
31700 (Manchester-Nashua, NH). 
Litchfield County, CT and Merrimack 
County, NH are not considered ‘‘urban’’ 
under § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (B) 
as revised under the FY 2008 IPPS final 
rule and, therefore, are considered 
‘‘rural’’ under § 412.64(b)(1)(ii)(C). 
Accordingly, to reflect our general 
policy for ESRD wage index, these two 
counties will be considered ‘‘rural’’ 
under the ESRD composite payment 
system effective with the next update of 
the payment rates on January 1, 2009, 
and will no longer be included in urban 
CBSA 25540 (Hartford-West Hartford- 
East Hartford, CT) and urban CBSA 
31700 (Manchester-Nashua, NH), 
respectively. We note that this policy is 
consistent with our other policy of not 
taking into account IPPS geographic 
reclassifications in determining 
payments under the composite payment 
system. 
(2) Multi-Campus Hospital Wage Index 
Data 
In the CY 2008 ESRD composite 
payment system final rule (72 FR 
66280), we established ESRD wage 
index values for CY 2008 calculated 
from the same data (collected from cost 
reports submitted by hospitals for cost 
reporting periods beginning during FY 
2004) used to compute the FY 2008 
acute care hospital inpatient wage 
index, without taking into account 
geographic reclassification under 
sections 1886(d)(8) and (d)(10) of the 
Act. However, the IPPS policy that 
apportions the wage data for multi- 
campus hospitals was not finalized 
before the ESRD composite payment 
system final rule. Therefore the CY 2008 
ESRD wage index values reflected the 
IPPS wage data are based on a hospital’s 
actual location without regard to the 
urban or rural designation of any related 
or affiliated provider. Accordingly, all 
wage data from different campuses of a 
multi-campus hospital were included in 
the calculation of the CBSA wage index 
of the main hospital. The ESRD wage 
index values applicable for services 
provided on or after January 1, 2008 
through December 31, 2008 are shown 
in Addendum G for urban areas and 
Addendum H for rural areas (72 FR 
66552 through 66574) of the CY 2008 
PFS final rule with comment period. 
We are continuing to use IPPS data for 
CY 2009 because we believe that in the 
absence of dialysis facility specific wage 
data, using the hospital inpatient wage 
data is appropriate and reasonable for 
the ESRD composite payment system. 
We note that the IPPS wage data used 
to determine the proposed CY 2009 
ESRD wage index values were 
computed from wage data submitted by 
hospitals for cost reporting periods 
beginning in FY 2005 and reflect our 
policy adopted under the IPPS 
beginning in FY 2008, which apportions 
the wage data for multi-campus 
hospitals located in different labor 
market areas, CBSAs, to each CBSA 
where the campuses are located (see the 
FY 2008 IPPS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 47317 through 47320)). 
Specifically, for the proposed CY 2009 
ESRD composite payment system, the 
wage index was computed using IPPS 
wage data (published by hospitals for 
cost reporting periods beginning in 
2005, as with the FY 2009 IPPS wage 
index), which allocated salaries and 
hours to the campuses of two multi- 
campus hospitals with campuses that 
are located in different labor areas; one 
in Massachusetts and the other is 
Illinois. The ESRD wage index values 
proposed for CY 2009 in the following 
CBSAs are affected by this policy: 
Boston-Quincy, MA (CBSA 14484), 
Providence-New Bedford-Falls River, 
RI–MA (CBSA 39300), Chicago- 
Naperville-Joliet, IL (CBSA 16974), and 
Lake County-Kenosha County, IL–WI 
(CBSA 29404). Please refer to 
Addendums G and H of this proposed 
rule. 
In summary, for CY 2009, we propose 
to use the FY 2009 wage index data 
(collected from cost reports submitted 
by hospitals for cost reporting periods 
beginning during FY 2005) to compute 
the ESRD composite payment rates 
effective beginning January 1, 2009. 
These data reflect the multi-campus and 
New England deemed counties policies 
discussed above. 
iii. Budget Neutrality Adjustment 
Section 1881(b)(12)(E)(i) of the Act, as 
added by section 623(d) of the MMA, 
requires any revisions to the ESRD 
composite rate payment system as a 
result of the MMA provision (including 
the geographic adjustment) be made in 
a budget neutral manner. This means 
that aggregate payments to ESRD 
facilities in CY 2008 should be the same 
as aggregate payments that would have 
been made if we had not made any 
changes to the geographic adjusters. We 
note that this BN adjustment only 
addresses the impact of changes in the 
geographic adjustments. A separate BN 
adjustment was developed for the case- 
mix adjustments currently in effect. As 
we are not proposing any changes to the 
case-mix measures for CY 2009, the 
current case-mix BN adjustment will 
remain in effect for CY 2009. As in CY 
2008, for CY 2009, we again propose to 
apply a BN adjustment factor (1.056672) 
directly to the ESRD wage index values. 
As explained in the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period (71 FR 69687 
through 69688), we believe this is the 
simplest approach because it allows us 
to maintain our base composite rates 
during the transition from the current 
wage adjustments to the revised wage 
adjustments described previously in this 
section. Because the ESRD wage index 
is only applied to the labor-related 
portion of the composite rate, we 
computed the BN adjustment factor 
based on that proportion (53.711 
percent). 
To compute the proposed CY 2009 
wage index BN adjustment factor 
(1.056672), we used the FY 2005 pre- 
floor, pre-reclassified, non-occupational 
mix-adjusted hospital data to compute 
the wage index values, 2007 outpatient 
claims (paid and processed as of 
December 31, 2007), and geographic 
location information for each facility 
which may be found through the 
Dialysis Facility Compare Web page on 
the CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
DialysisFacilityCompare/. The FY 2005 
hospital wage index data for each urban 
and rural locale by CBSA may also be 
accessed on the CMS Web site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
AcuteInpatientPPS/WIFN/list.asp. The 
wage index data are located in the 
section entitled, ‘‘FY 2009 Proposed 
Rule Occupational Mix Adjusted and 
Unadjusted Average Hourly Wage and 
Pre-Reclassified Wage Index by CBSA.’’

38533 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Using treatment counts from the 2007 
claims and facility-specific CY 2008 
composite rates, we computed the 
estimated total dollar amount each 
ESRD provider would have received in 
the CY 2008 (the 3rd year of the 4-year 
transition). The total of these payments 
became the target amount of 
expenditures for all ESRD facilities for 
CY 2009. Next, we computed the 
estimated dollar amount that would 
have been paid to the same ESRD 
facilities using the proposed ESRD wage 
index for CY 2009 (the 4th year of the 
4-year transition). The total of these 
payments became the fourth year new 
amount of wage-adjusted composite rate 
expenditures for all ESRD facilities. 
After comparing these two dollar 
amounts (target amount divided by the 
4th year new amount), we calculated an 
adjustment factor that, when multiplied 
by the applicable CY 2009 ESRD 
proposed wage index value, would 
result in aggregate payments to ESRD 
facilities that will remain within the 
target amount of composite rate 
expenditures. When making this 
calculation, the ESRD wage index floor 
value of 0.7000 is used whenever 
appropriate. The proposed BN 
adjustment factor for the CY 2009 wage 
index is 1.056672. 
To ensure BN, we also must apply the 
BN adjustment factor to the proposed 
wage index floor of 0.7000 which results 
in a proposed adjusted wage index floor 
of 0.7397 (0.7500 × 1.056672) for CY 
2009. 
iv. ESRD Wage Index Tables 
The proposed 2009 wage index tables 
are located in Addenda G and H of this 
proposed rule. 
v. Application of the Hospital-Acquired 
Conditions Payment Policy for IPPS 
Hospitals to Other Settings 
Value-based purchasing (VBP) ties 
payment to performance through the use 
of incentives based on measures of 
quality and cost of care. The 
implementation of VBP is rapidly 
transforming CMS from being a passive 
payer of claims to an active purchaser 
of higher quality, more efficient health 
care for Medicare beneficiaries. Our 
VBP initiatives include hospital pay for 
reporting (the Reporting Hospital 
Quality Date for the Annual Payment 
Update Program), physician pay for 
reporting (the Physician Quality 
Reporting Initiative), home health pay 
for reporting, the Hospital VBP Plan 
Report to Congress, and various VBP 
demonstration programs across payment 
settings, including the Premier Hospital 
Quality Incentive Demonstration and 
the Physician Group Practice 
Demonstration. 
The preventable hospital-acquired 
conditions (HAC) payment provision for 
IPPS hospitals is another of our value- 
based purchasing initiatives. The 
principal behind the HAC payment 
provision (Medicare not paying more for 
healthcare-associated conditions) could 
be applied to the Medicare payment 
systems for other settings of care. 
Section 1886(d)(4)(D) of the Act requires 
the Secretary to select for the HAC IPPS 
payment provision conditions that are: 
(1) High cost, high volume, or both; (2) 
assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG 
when present as a secondary diagnosis; 
and (3) could reasonably have been 
prevented through the application of 
evidence-based guidelines. Beginning 
October 1, 2008, Medicare can no longer 
assign an inpatient hospital discharge to 
a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected 
HAC condition was not present on 
admission. That is, the case will be paid 
as though the secondary diagnosis was 
not present. Medicare will continue to 
assign a discharge to a higher paying 
Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related 
Group (MS-DRG) if a selected condition 
was present on admission. 
The broad principle articulated in the 
HAC payment provision for IPPS 
hospitals—Medicare not paying for 
healthcare-associated conditions—could 
potentially be applied to other Medicare 
payment systems for conditions that 
occur in settings other than IPPS 
hospitals. Other possible settings of care 
include, but are not limited to: Hospital 
outpatient departments; SNFs; HHAs; 
ESRD facilities; and physician practices. 
The implementation would be different 
for each setting, as each payment system 
is different and the reasonable 
preventability through the application 
of evidence-based guidelines would 
vary for candidate conditions over the 
different settings. However, alignment 
of incentives across settings of care is an 
important goal for all of our VBP 
initiatives, including the HAC 
provision. 
A related application of the broad 
principle behind the HAC payment 
provision for IPPS hospitals could be 
considered through Medicare secondary 
payer policy by requiring the provider 
that failed to prevent the occurrence of 
a preventable condition in one setting to 
pay for all or part of the necessary 
follow up care in a second setting. This 
would help shield the Medicare 
program from inappropriately paying for 
the downstream effects of a preventable 
condition acquired in the first setting 
but treated in the second setting. 
We note that we are not proposing 
new Medicare policy in this discussion 
of the possible application of HACs 
payment policy for IPPS hospitals to 
other settings, as some of these 
approaches may require new statutory 
authority. We are seeking public 
comment on the application of the 
preventable HACs payment provision 
for IPPS hospitals to other Medicare 
payment systems. We look forward to 
working with stakeholders in the fight 
against healthcare-associated 
conditions. 
I. Independent Diagnostic Testing 
Facility (IDTF) Issues 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘INDEPENDENT DIAGNOSTIC 
TESTING FACILITIES’’ at the beginning 
of your comments.] 
In the CY 2007 and 2008 PFS final 
rules with comment period, we 
established performance standards for 
suppliers enrolled in the Medicare 
program as an IDTF (71 FR 69695 and 
72 FR 66285). These standards were 
established to improve the quality of 
care for diagnostic testing furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries by a Medicare 
enrolled IDTF and to improve our 
ability to verify that these suppliers 
meet minimum enrollment criteria to 
enroll or maintain enrollment in the 
Medicare program. These performance 
standards were established at § 410.33. 
In this proposed rule, we are again 
proposing to expand on the quality and 
program safeguard activities that we 
implemented previously. 
1. Improving Quality of Diagnostic 
Testing Services Furnished by Physician 
and Nonphysician Practitioner 
Organizations 
During the CY 2008 PFS proposed 
rule comment period, we received 
comments requesting that we require 
that the IDTF performance standards 
adopted in § 410.33, including 
prohibitions regarding the sharing of 
space and leasing/sharing arrangements, 
apply to physicians and nonphysician 
practitioners (NPPs) who are performing 
diagnostic testing services for Medicare 
beneficiaries, and who have enrolled in 
the Medicare program as a clinic, group 
practice, or physician office. The 
commenters stated that standards for 
imaging services were not applied 
consistently for all imaging centers and 
that two distinct compliance and 
regulatory standards would emerge 
depending on how the similarly situated 
imaging centers were enrolled. In 
addition, one commenter stated that we 
should not prohibit space sharing when 
done with an adjoining physician 
practice or radiology group that is an 
owner of an IDTF.

38534 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
In response to the public comments, 
we are concerned that— 
• Certain physician entities, 
including physician group practices, 
and clinics, can enroll as a group 
practice or clinic and provide diagnostic 
testing services without the benefit of 
qualified nonphysician personnel, as 
defined in § 410.33(c), to conduct 
diagnostic testing. 
• Some physician entities expect to 
furnish diagnostic testing services for 
their own patients and the general 
public and are making the decision to 
enroll as a group or clinic thereby 
circumventing the performance 
standards found in the IDTF 
requirements in § 410.33. 
• Some physician organizations are 
furnishing diagnostic tests using mobile 
equipment provided by an entity that 
furnishes mobile diagnostic services. 
We are proposing certain exceptions 
to the established performance 
standards found in § 410.33(g) because 
we believe that physician organizations 
already meet or exceed some of these 
standards. For example, their liability 
insurance coverage usually far exceeds 
the $300,000 per incident threshold, 
and there are a host of ways in which 
patient may issue clinical complaints 
concerning their physicians. In 
addition, we believe that compliance 
with some of the performance standards 
would be costly and burdensome and 
possibly limit beneficiary access, 
particularly in rural or medically 
underserved areas. For these reasons, 
we propose not to require physician 
entities to comply with the following 
standards: 
• Maintaining additional 
comprehensive liability insurance for 
each practice location as required under 
§ 410.33(g)(6). 
• Maintaining a formal clinical 
complaint process as required under 
§ 410.33(g)(8). 
• Posting IDTF standards as required 
under § 410.33(g)(9). 
• Maintaining a visible sign posting 
business hours as required under 
§ 410.33(g)(14)(ii). 
• Separately enrolling each practice 
location as required under 
§ 410.33(g)(15)(i). 
Accordingly, we are proposing to add 
§ 410.33(j) which states that, ‘‘A 
physician or NPP organization (as 
defined in § 424.502) furnishing 
diagnostic testing services, except 
diagnostic mammography services: (1) 
Must enroll as an independent 
diagnostic testing facility for each 
practice location furnishing these 
services; and (2) is subject to the 
provisions found in § 410.33, except for 
§ 410.33(g)(6), § 410.33(g)(8), 
§ 410.33(g)(9), § 410.33(g)(14)(ii), and 
§ 410.33(g)(15)(i). As discussed in 
section II.J. of this preamble, we propose 
to define a ‘‘physician or nonphysician 
practitioner organization’’ as any 
physician or NPP entity that enrolls in 
the Medicare program as a sole 
proprietorship or organizational entity 
such as a clinic or group practice. 
We maintain that this enrollment 
requirement is necessary to ensure that 
beneficiaries are receiving the quality of 
care that can only be administered by 
appropriately licensed or credentialed 
nonphysician personnel as described in 
§ 410.33(c). Moreover, we propose that 
physician or NPP organizations that do 
not enroll as an IDTF and meet the 
provisions at § 410.33 may be subject to 
claims denial for diagnostic testing 
services or a revocation of their billing 
privileges. 
We are soliciting comments on 
whether we should consider 
establishing additional exceptions to the 
established performance standards in 
§ 410.33(g) for physician and NPP 
organizations furnishing diagnostic 
testing services. 
While we believe that most physician 
and NPP organizations utilize 
nonphysician personnel described in 
§ 410.33(c) to furnish diagnostic testing 
services, we are also soliciting 
comments on whether physician or 
NPPs conduct diagnostic tests without 
benefit of qualified nonphysician 
personnel and under what 
circumstances the testing occurs. 
While we are proposing to apply the 
IDTF requirement to all diagnostic 
testing services furnished in physicians’ 
offices, we are considering whether to 
limit this enrollment requirement to less 
than the full range of diagnostic testing 
services, such as to procedures that 
generally involve more costly testing 
and equipment. We seek comment about 
whether the policy should apply only to 
imaging services or whether it should 
also include other diagnostic testing 
services such as electrocardiograms or 
other diagnostic testing services 
frequently furnished by primary care 
physicians. Within the scope of imaging 
services, we seek comment about 
whether the policy should be limited to 
advanced diagnostic testing procedures 
which could include diagnostic 
magnetic resonance imaging, computed 
tomography, and nuclear medicine 
(including positron emission 
tomography), and other such diagnostic 
testing procedures described in section 
1848(b)(4)(B) of the Act (excluding X- 
ray, ultrasound, and fluoroscopy). We 
are also soliciting comments on what 
would be appropriate criteria to limit 
this provision. 
Finally, since this change, if adopted, 
would take time to implement for 
suppliers that have enrolled in the 
Medicare program, we are proposing an 
effective date of September 30, 2009, 
rather than the effective date of the final 
rule. For newly enrolling suppliers, the 
effective date of this rule would be 
January 1, 2009. 
2. Mobile Entity Billing Requirements 
To ensure that entities furnishing 
mobile services are providing quality 
services and are billing for the 
diagnostic testing services they furnish 
to Medicare beneficiaries, we are 
proposing a new performance standard 
for mobile entities at § 410.33(g)(16), 
which would require that entities 
furnishing mobile diagnostic services 
enroll in Medicare and bill directly for 
the mobile diagnostic services that they 
furnish, regardless of where the services 
are performed. We believe that entities 
furnishing mobile diagnostic services to 
Medicare beneficiaries must be enrolled 
in the Medicare program, comply with 
the IDTF performance standards, and 
directly bill Medicare for the services 
they render. 
While we understand that a mobile 
entity can furnish diagnostic testing 
services in various types of locations, 
we believe that it is essential that 
mobile entities use qualified physicians 
or nonphysician personnel to perform 
diagnostic testing procedures and that 
the enrolled mobile supplier bill for the 
services rendered. We maintain that it is 
essential to our program integrity and 
quality improvement efforts that an 
entity furnishing mobile diagnostic 
testing services comply with the 
performance standards for IDTFs and 
bill the Medicare program directly for 
the services provided to Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
Since we believe that most mobile 
entities are already billing for the 
services they furnish, whether the 
service was provided in a fixed-based 
location or in a mobile facility, this 
proposed provision, if adopted, would 
be effective with the effective date of the 
final rule. 
3. Revocation of Enrollment and Billing 
Privileges of IDTFs in the Medicare 
Program 
Historically, we have allowed IDTFs 
whose Medicare billing numbers have 
been revoked to continue billing for 
services furnished prior to revocation 
for up to 27 months after the effective 
date of the revocation. Since we believe 
that permitting this extensive billing 
period poses a significant risk to the 
Medicare program, we are proposing to 
limit the claims submission timeframe

38535 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
after revocation. In § 424.535(g), we are 
proposing that a revoked IDTF must 
submit all outstanding claims for not 
previously submitted items and services 
furnished within 30 calendar days of the 
revocation effective date. We maintain 
that this change is necessary to limit the 
Medicare program exposure to future 
vulnerabilities from physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners that have had their billing 
privileges revoked. Accordingly, this 
proposed change would allow a 
Medicare contractor to conduct focused 
medical review on the claims submitted 
during the claims filing period to ensure 
that each claim is supported by medical 
documentation that the contractor can 
verify. We maintain that focused 
medical review of these claims will 
ensure that Medicare only pays for 
services furnished by a physician or 
NPP organization or individual 
practitioner and that these entities and 
individuals receive payment in a timely 
manner. In addition, we are also 
proposing to amend § 424.44(a)(3) to 
account for this provision related to the 
requirements for the timely filing of 
claims. The timely filing requirements 
in § 424.44(a)(1) and (a)(2) will no 
longer apply to physician and NPP 
organizations, physicians, NPPs and 
IDTFs whose billing privileges have 
been revoked by CMS. 
J. Physician and Nonphysician 
Practitioner (NPP) Enrollment Issues 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘PHYSICIAN AND 
NONPHYSICIAN PRACTITIONER 
ENROLLMENT ISSUES’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
1. Effective Date of Medicare Billing 
Privileges 
In accordance with § 424.510, 
physician and NPP organizations (that 
is, groups, clinics, and sole owners) and 
individual practitioners including 
physicians and NPPs, operating as sole 
proprietorships or reassigning their 
benefits to a physician and 
nonphysician organization may submit 
claims as specified in § 424.44 after they 
are enrolled in the Medicare program. 
This provision permits newly enrolled 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners, as well as 
existing physicians and nonphysician 
organizations and individual 
practitioners to submit claims for 
services for services that were rendered 
prior to the date of filing or the date the 
applicant received billing privileges to 
participate in the Medicare program. 
For the purposes of this proposed 
rule, we believe that a NPP includes, but 
is not limited to, the following 
individuals: Anesthesiology assistants, 
audiologists, certified nurse midwifes, 
certified registered nurse anesthetists, 
clinical social workers, NPs, 
occupational therapists in private 
practice, physical therapists in private 
practice, PAs, clinical psychologists, 
psychologists billing independently, 
and registered dieticians or nutrition 
professionals. 
Once enrolled, physician and NPP 
organizations and individual physicians 
and NPPs, depending on their effective 
date of enrollment, may retroactively 
bill the Medicare program for services 
that were rendered up to 27 months 
prior to being enrolled to participate in 
the Medicare program. For example, if 
a supplier is enrolled in the Medicare 
program in December 2008 with an 
approval date back to October 2006, that 
supplier could retrospectively bill for 
services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries as early as October 1, 2006. 
Currently, physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners, including physicians and 
NPPs, are not prohibited from billing 
Medicare prior to their enrollment date. 
Therefore, it is possible that the 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners who meet our 
program requirements on the date of 
enrollment may not have met those 
same requirements prior to the date of 
enrollment, even though that supplier 
could bill Medicare and receive 
payments for services rendered up to 27 
months prior to their enrolling in the 
Medicare program. We are concerned 
that some physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners may bill Medicare for 
services when they are not meeting our 
other program requirements, including 
those related to providing beneficiary 
protections, such as Advance 
Beneficiary Notices. 
We are seeking public comment on 
two approaches for establishing an 
effective date for Medicare billing 
privileges for physician and NPP 
organizations and for individual 
practitioners. 
The first approach would establish 
the initial enrollment date for physician 
and NPP organizations and for 
individual practitioners, including 
physician and NPPs, as the date of 
approval by a Medicare contractor. This 
approach would prohibit physician and 
NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners from billing for services 
rendered to a Medicare beneficiary 
before they are approved and enrolled 
by a designated Medicare contractor to 
participate in the Medicare program and 
Medicare billing privileges are conveyed 
to their National Provider Identifier 
(NPI). The date of approval is the date 
that a designated Medicare contractor 
determines that the physician or NPP 
organizations or individual practitioner 
meets all Federal and State 
requirements for their supplier type. 
Given this first approach, in 
§ 424.520, we may implement 
regulations text that reads similar to 
‘‘the effective date of billing privileges 
for physician and NPP organizations 
and individual practitioners, including 
physicians and NPPs, is the date a 
Medicare contractor conveys billing 
privileges to an NPI.’’ 
We believe that this approach— 
• Prohibits physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners from receiving payments 
before a Medicare contractor conveys 
Medicare billing privileges to an NPI (69 
FR 3434); 
• Is consistent with our requirements 
in § 489.13 for those providers and 
certain suppliers that require a State 
survey prior to being enrolled and the 
requirements for durable medical 
equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and 
supplies (DMEPOS) suppliers in 
§ 424.57(b)(2); 
• Is consistent with our requirements 
for providers identified in § 400.202 and 
surveyed suppliers are allowed to bill 
for service only after they are approved 
to participate in the Medicare program. 
Surveyed suppliers are suppliers who 
have been certified by either CMS or a 
State certification agency and are in 
compliance with Medicare 
requirements. Surveyed suppliers may 
include ASCs or portable x-ray 
suppliers; and 
• Ensures that we are able to verify a 
supplier’s qualifications, including 
meeting any performance standards 
before payment for services can occur. 
The second approach would establish 
the initial enrollment date for physician 
and NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners, including physician and 
NPPs, as the later of: (1) The date of 
filing of a Medicare enrollment 
application that was subsequently 
approved by a fee-for-service (FFS) 
contractor; or (2) the date an enrolled 
supplier first started rendering services 
at a new practice location. The date of 
filing the enrollment application is the 
date that the Medicare FFS contractor 
receives a signed Medicare enrollment 
application that the Medicare FFS 
contractor is able to process to approval. 
This option would allow a supplier that 
is already seeing non-Medicare patients 
to start billing for Medicare patients 
beginning on the day they submit an 
enrollment application that can be fully 
processed. In contrast to the first option,

38536 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
a newly enrolling physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners or physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners that are establishing or 
changing a practice location would be 
allowed to bill the Medicare program for 
services furnished to Medicare 
beneficiaries on or after the date of filing 
if a Medicare contractor approves 
Medicare billing privileges and conveys 
billing privileges to an NPI. It is also 
important to note that if a Medicare 
contractor rejects or denies an 
enrollment application, then the 
physician or NPP organization or 
individual practitioner is at risk of not 
receiving payment for any services 
furnished after the date of filing. 
Given this second approach, in 
§ 424.520, we may implement 
regulations text that reads similar to 
‘‘the effective date of billing privileges 
for physician and NPP organizations 
and for individual practitioners, 
physicians and NPPs, is the later of—(1) 
The filing date of the Medicare 
enrollment application that was 
subsequently approved by an FFS 
contractor; or (2) The date that the 
physician or NPP organization or 
individual practitioner first furnished 
services at a new practice location.’’ 
We believe that this approach— 
• Prohibits physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners, including physician and 
NPPs, from receiving payments before a 
Medicare contractor conveys Medicare 
billing privileges to an NPI (69 FR 
3434); 
• Is consistent with our requirements 
found at § 410.33(i) that limit the 
retrospective billing for IDTFs and 
ensures that Medicare billing privileges 
are conveyed to physician and NPP 
organizations and to individual 
physician and NPPs in a similar manner 
similar to IDTFs; and 
• Addresses the public’s concern 
regarding contractor processing 
timeliness while appropriately ensuring 
that Medicare payments are made to 
physician and NPP organizations and to 
individual physician and NPPs who 
have enrolled in a timely manner. 
We maintain that it is not possible to 
verify that a supplier has met all of 
Medicare’s enrollment requirements 
prior to submitting an enrollment 
application. Therefore, the Medicare 
program should not be billed for 
services before the later of the two dates 
that a physician or NPP organization, 
physician or NPP has submitted an 
enrollment application that can be fully 
processed or when the enrolled supplier 
is open for business. 
To assist physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners in enrolling and updating 
their existing enrollment record, we 
established Internet-based enrollment 
process known as Internet-based 
Provider Enrollment, Chain and 
Ownership System (PECOS). Internet- 
based PECOS is available to physician 
and NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners in all States, except 
California, Missouri, and New York, in 
early CY 2009. We expect that Internet- 
based PECOS will be available to 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners in California, 
Missouri, and New York by September 
30, 2009. 
By using Internet-based PECOS, we 
expect that physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners will be able reduce the 
time necessary to enroll in the Medicare 
program or make a change in their 
Medicare enrollment record by reducing 
common errors in the application 
submission process. We expect that 
Medicare contractors will fully process 
most complete Internet-based PECOS 
enrollment applications within 30 to 45 
calendar days compared to 60 to 90 
calendar days in the current paper- 
based enrollment process. Thus, if 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners enroll in the 
Medicare program or make a change in 
their existing Medicare enrollment 
using Internet-based PECOS and submit 
required supporting documentation, 
including a signed certification 
statement, licensing and education 
documentation, and, if necessary, the 
electronic funds transfer authorization 
agreement (CMS–588) 45 days before 
their effective date, a Medicare 
contractor should be able to process the 
enrollment application without a delay 
in payment. 
The date of filing for Internet-based 
PECOS will be the date the Medicare 
FFS contractor receives all of the 
following: (1) A signed certification 
statement; (2) an electronic version of 
the enrollment application; and (3) a 
signature page that the Medicare FFS 
contractor processes to approval. 
In § 424.502, we are also proposing to 
define a physician and NPP 
organization to mean any physician or 
NPP entity that enrolls in the Medicare 
program as a sole proprietorship or 
organizational entity such as clinic or 
group practice. In addition to 
establishing organizational structure as 
a sole proprietorship, physicians and 
NPPs are able to establish various 
organizational relationships including 
corporations, professional associations, 
partnerships, limited liability 
corporations and subchapter S 
corporations. We believe that proposed 
definition above would include sole 
proprietorships that receive a type 1 NPI 
and any organizational entity that is 
required to obtain a type 2 NPI. 
2. Medicare Billing Privileges and 
Existing Tax Delinquency 
The Government Accountability 
Office (GAO) found that over 21,000 of 
the physicians, health professionals, 
and suppliers paid under Medicare Part 
B during the first 9 months of calendar 
year 2005 had tax debts totaling over $1 
billion. The GAO report titled, 
‘‘Medicare, Thousands of Medicare Part 
B Providers Abuse the Federal Tax 
System (GAO–07–587T)’’ found abusive 
and potentially criminal activity, 
including failure to remit to IRS 
individual income taxes or payroll taxes 
or both withheld from their employees. 
While we do not currently consider 
whether an individual physician, NPP 
currently enrolled in the Medicare 
program has delinquent tax debts with 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we 
do consider whether a physician or NPP 
was convicted of a Federal or State 
felony offense, including income tax 
evasion, that we have determined to be 
detrimental to the best interest of the 
Medicare program. Moreover, if a 
physician or NPP was convicted of 
Federal or State felony offense within 
the 10 years preceding enrollment or 
revalidation of enrollment that we 
determined to be detrimental to the best 
interest of the Medicare program, we 
could deny or revoke the Medicare 
billing privileges of the physician or 
NPP. 
The Financial Management Service 
(FMS), a bureau of the Department of 
Treasury, initiated the Federal Payment 
Levy Program (FPLP) portion of the 
Continuous Levy Program in July 2000 
to recover delinquent Federal tax debts. 
The FPLP is a program whereby 
delinquent Federal income tax debts are 
collected by levying non-tax payments, 
as authorized by the Taxpayer Relief Act 
of 1997 (Pub. L. 105–34). The FPLP 
includes vendor and Social Security 
benefit payments, and Medicare 
payments. It is accomplished through a 
process of matching delinquent debtor 
data with payment record data. This 
automated collection of debt at the time 
of payment occurs after the delinquent 
taxpayer has been afforded due process, 
in accordance with the Internal Revenue 
Code. 
In July 2000, the IRS in conjunction 
with the Department of Treasury’s FMS 
started the FPLP which is authorized by 
section 6331(h) of the Internal Revenue 
Code as prescribed by section 1024 of 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 18:46 Jul 03, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00036 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\07JYP2.SGM 07JYP2sro

38537 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Through this program, the IRS can 
collect overdue taxes through a 
continuous levy on certain Federal 
payments disbursed by FMS; it 
generally allows Medicare to match a 
claim to a delinquent taxpayer, offset 
the payment, and recover a percentage 
of the amount due. 
The FPLP is a collection and 
enforcement tool used by the IRS for 
individuals that have received all 
requisite notification of tax delinquency 
and who have either exhausted or 
neglected to use their respective appeal 
rights; therefore, the FPLP is only 
applied after all previous IRS 
collections efforts have failed. 
Accordingly, the FPLP is an automated 
levy program where certain delinquent 
taxpayers are systematically matched 
and levied on their Federal payments 
disbursed by Treasury’s FMS. 
In 2001, we implemented the FPLP 
process for Medicare Part C and vendor 
payments, and in FY 2009, we will 
implement the FPLP process for 
payments made to providers and 
suppliers reimbursed under Part A and 
Part B of the Medicare program. 
However, the FPLP does not allow CMS 
to offset a payment when an individual 
reassigns his or her benefits to a third- 
party, such as a group practice where an 
existing Federal tax delinquency exists. 
Consistent with statutory authority 
found under sections 1866(j)(1)(A) and 
1871 of the Act, we believe that we have 
the authority to establish and make 
changes to the enrollment process for 
providers and suppliers of service. 
Accordingly, to ensure that the Federal 
government is able to recoup delinquent 
Federal tax debts from physicians and 
NPPs who are enrolled in the Medicare 
program and are receiving payments, we 
are considering revoking the billing 
privileges for those individuals for 
which a tax delinquency exists and we 
are unable to directly levy future 
payments through the FPLP. While we 
are not proposing this change in this 
year’s PFS, we will consider proposing 
this type of change in a future 
rulemaking effort after we have 
implemented the FPLP process, 
monitored and evaluated the 
implementation of FPLP process, and 
analyzed the potential impact of this 
change on physician and NPPs who are 
subject to the FPLP but that we are 
unable to directly levy future payments 
through the FPLP. In addition, we 
expect to conduct outreach regarding 
our implementation in advance of 
implementing the FPLP in FY 2009. 
We believe that this change, if 
proposed and adopted, would prohibit 
an individual with a tax delinquency 
from shielding their future payments 
through reassignment of benefits to a 
third party. Finally, since the tax 
delinquency is incurred by an 
individual who has reassigned his or 
her benefits to a third party, we do not 
believe that it is appropriate to take 
action against the third-party. We 
believe that this is consistent with the 
protections already afforded to an 
individual by the IRS but ensures that 
Medicare does not enroll or allow 
continued enrollment to an individual 
with serious tax delinquency. 
We maintain that it is essential that a 
physician or NPP resolve any existing 
Federal tax delinquency before entering 
the Medicare program. This will ensure 
that the Medicare program is not making 
payment to an individual who has not 
met his or her obligation to pay their tax 
debts. 
Finally, we are soliciting comments 
on whether we should consider 
revoking a physician billing privileges 
or taking some other type of 
administrative action when a physician 
or NPP has a Federal tax delinquency 
that can not be levied through the FPLP 
process. We are also soliciting 
comments on whether we should 
consider revoking the billing privileges 
of an organizational entity or taking 
some other type of administrative action 
against organizational entities when the 
owners of an organizational entity have 
a Federal tax delinquency that can not 
be levied through the FPLP process. 
3. Denial of Enrollment in the Medicare 
Program (proposed § 424.530(a)(6) and 
(a)(7)) 
Currently, owners, authorized 
officials, and delegated officials of a 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners, including 
physicians and NPPs, can obtain 
additional billing privileges by 
establishing a new tax identification 
number (TIN), reassigning benefits to 
another entity, or by submitting an 
enrollment application as another 
provider or supplier type even though 
the entity for which the provider or 
supplier rendered services and has had 
its billing privileges revoked, 
suspended, or has an outstanding 
Medicare overpayment. Absent a reason 
to reject or deny a Medicare enrollment 
application, the Medicare FFS 
contractor is required to approve the 
enrollment application for a provider or 
supplier who meets all other Federal 
and State enrollment requirements for 
their provider or supplier type. 
By submitting and having an 
enrollment application (for example, an 
initial application or a change of 
ownership) with a new TIN, some 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners are able to 
circumvent existing Medicare 
revocation, payment suspension, 
overpayment recovery, and medical 
review processes by obtaining 
additional Medicare billing privileges. 
By obtaining additional billing 
privileges for multiple locations, these 
providers and suppliers are able to 
discontinue the use of the NPI that has 
an administrative action against it and 
bill and receive payment under another 
NPI. 
Consistent with § 405.371, we will 
impose a payment suspension when we 
possesses reliable information that an 
overpayment or fraud, or willful 
misrepresentation exist, or that 
payments to be made may not be 
correct. While providers and suppliers 
do not have formal appeal rights to a 
payment suspension determination, 
providers and suppliers can submit a 
rebuttal to CMS’ payment suspension 
determination. We believe that it is 
essential that we resolve the payment 
suspension determination before we 
grant additional billing privileges to 
these providers or suppliers. In concert 
with § 405.372(c), once a payment 
suspension has been terminated, 
providers and suppliers may then apply 
for billing privileges. 
Moreover, we are obligated to recover 
Medicare overpayments as 
expeditiously as possible. Providers and 
suppliers can pay the debt or Medicare 
can reduce present or future Medicare 
payments and applying the amount 
withheld to the indebtedness. When we 
identify an overpayment and provide 
notice of the overpayment, physician 
and NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners are given an opportunity to 
appeal the determination. Under certain 
conditions the overpayment collection 
process is suspended during the appeals 
process. However, if the physician and 
NPP organization or individual 
practitioner does not appeal the 
overpayment determination, the 
overpayment determination is upheld 
on appeal, we will initiate a recovery 
action. However, in some cases, 
physician and NPP organizations or 
individual practitioners will try to 
circumvent the recovery process by 
seeking additional billing privileges and 
billing under the new billing number. 
Accordingly, we propose to add a new 
§ 424.530(a)(6) and (a)(7) to deny 
enrollment applications for additional 
Medicare billing privileges if the 
physician or NPP organization or 
individual practitioner has an active 
payment suspension or has an existing 
overpayment that has not been repaid. 
We are proposing that a Medicare FFS

contractor be allowed to deny 
enrollment applications from those 
authorized officials, delegated officials, 
owners, and individual practitioners 
that own a supplier or provider at the 
time of filing until such time as the 
administrative action is terminated or 
the Medicare overpayment has been 
repaid in full. Specifically, we are 
proposing to deny enrollment to any 
current owner (as defined in § 424.502), 
physician, or NPP, who is participating 
in the Medicare program and is under 
a current Medicare payment suspension. 
We believe that the change to our 
denial policy would help protect the 
Medicare program from unscrupulous or 
problematic physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners. Moreover, this change 
would allow—(1) Medicare FFS 
contractors to improve customer service 
to all providers and suppliers that are 
already enrolled in the Medicare 
program; (2) facilitate the enrollment of 
all providers and suppliers seeking to 
enroll in the Medicare program for the 
first time; and (3) expand on existing 
efforts to process changes in a timely 
manner and provide better customer 
service. 
4. Reporting Requirements for Providers 
and Suppliers (proposed § 424.516 and 
§ 424.535(a)(10)) 
Currently, § 424.520(b) requires that 
providers and suppliers, except 
DMEPOS and IDTF suppliers, report to 
CMS most changes to the information 
furnished on the enrollment application 
and furnish supporting documentation 
within 90 calendar days of the change 
(changes in ownership must be reported 
within 30 days). As specified in 
§ 424.57(c)(2), DMEPOS suppliers, have 
only 30 calendar days to submit changes 
of information to CMS. As specified in 
§ 410.33(g)(2), IDTFs, must report 
changes in ownership, changes in 
location, changes in general 
supervision, and adverse legal actions 
within 30 calendar days. All other 
changes to the enrollment application 
must be reported within 90 days. 
While physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners are required to report 
changes within 90 days of the reportable 
event, in many cases, there is little or no 
incentive for them to report a change 
that may adversely affect their ability to 
continue to receive Medicare payments. 
For example, physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners purposely may fail to 
report a felony conviction or other 
adverse legal action, such as a 
revocation or suspension of a license to 
a provider of health care by any State 
licensing authority, or a revocation or 
suspension of accreditation, because 
reporting this action may result in the 
revocation of their Medicare billing 
privileges. Thus, unless CMS or our 
designated contractor becomes aware of 
the conviction or adverse legal action 
through other means, the change may 
never be reported by a physician and 
NPP organization or individual 
practitioner. Alternatively, if CMS or 
our designated contractor becomes 
aware of the conviction or adverse legal 
action after the fact, we lack the 
regulatory authority to collect 
overpayments for the period in which 
the physician and NPP organizations 
and individual practitioners should 
have had their billing privileges 
revoked. 
Since we believe that physician and 
NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners must furnish updates to 
their Medicare enrollment information 
in a timely manner, we are proposing a 
new § 424.516(d) which would establish 
more stringent reporting requirements 
for physician NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners. (We are 
proposing to redesignate § 424.520 as 
§ 424.516 and amend the provisions in 
new § 424.516.) In addition to a change 
of ownership (as currently specified in 
redesignated § 424.516(d)(1)(i)), we are 
proposing to add § 424.516(d)(1)(ii) that 
requires all physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners to notify CMS’ designated 
contractor of any adverse legal action 
within 30 days. Adverse legal actions 
include, but are not limited to, felonies, 
license suspensions, and the Office of 
the Inspector General (OIG) exclusion or 
debarment. We believe that a physician 
and NPP organizations and individual 
practitioner’s failure to comply with the 
reporting requirements within the time 
frames described above may result in 
the revocation of Medicare billing 
privileges and a Medicare overpayment 
from the date of the reportable change. 
Specifically, we believe that an adverse 
legal action may preclude payment, and 
thus, establish an overpayment from the 
date of the adverse action. As such, we 
believe that physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners should not be allowed to 
retain any reimbursement they receive 
after the adverse legal action. 
We believe that it is essential that this 
type of change be reported in a timely 
manner (that is within 30 days). For 
example, if CMS or our designated 
contractor determines in February 2008 
that a physician failed to notify 
Medicare about an adverse legal action 
that occurred on June 30, 2007, that 
physician may be subject to an 
overpayment for all Medicare payments 
beginning June 30, 2007 and have its 
Medicare billing privileges revoked 
effective retroactively back to June 30, 
2007 as well. 
Additionally, we are proposing to add 
a requirement for change in location at 
§ 424.516(d)(1)(iii). Since a change in 
location may impact the amount of 
payment for services rendered by 
placing the physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners into a new CBSA. We 
believe that it is essential that physician 
and NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners report changes in practice 
location including those that impact the 
amount of payments they receive within 
a timely period (that is, 30 days). 
However, unlike an adverse legal action, 
which may preclude all payments if 
reported, failure to report a change in 
practice location may impact the 
amount of payment, not whether a 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners may be eligible 
to receive payments. Accordingly, we 
believe that failing to report changes in 
practice location would result in an 
overpayment for the difference in 
payment rates retroactive to the date the 
change in practice location occurred 
and may result in the revocation of 
Medicare billing privileges. For 
example, if a physician and NPP 
organization moves its practice location 
in New York, from urban Herkimer 
County to Hamilton County or Lewis 
County, which are both rural, but fails 
to update its provider enrollment 
information; then it would no longer be 
able to receive the higher payment rate 
associated with Herkimer County. We 
believe that reporting these types of 
changes is essential for making correct 
and appropriate payments. 
We are proposing to add 
§ 424.535(a)(9) which would specify 
that failure to comply with the reporting 
requirements specified in § 424.516(d) 
would be a basis for revocation. 
Additionally, we are proposing in 
§ 424.565(a), ‘‘Failure to comply with 
the reporting requirements specified in 
§ 424.516(d) would result in a Medicare 
overpayment from the date of an 
adverse legal action or a change in 
practice location.’’ In this situation, an 
overpayment for failure to timely report 
these changes would be calculated back 
to the date of the adverse legal action or 
the date of the change in practice 
location. Once an overpayment has been 
assessed, we will follow the 
overpayment regulations established at 
42 CFR Part 405 subpart C. We 
previously addressed these procedures 
in Chapter 4 of the Medicare Financial 
Management Manual (IOM Manual 100–

38539 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
06). Lastly, collection of overpayments 
related to § 424.516(d)(1)(iii) would not 
begin until after the effective date of the 
final rule. 
Since it is essential that physician and 
NPP organizations and individual 
practitioners notify their designated 
contractor of these types of reportable 
events in a timely manner and to ensure 
that the provider or supplier continues 
to be eligible for payment, we believe 
that it is essential that we establish an 
overpayment from the time of the 
reportable event. We believe that 
establishing an overpayment and 
revocation of billing privileges for 
noncompliance from the time of the 
reportable event would provide the 
supplier with a compelling incentive to 
report reportable changes in the 30-day 
reporting period. 
In addition, if CMS or our designated 
contractor determines that a physician 
and NPP organization or an individual 
practitioner has moved and has not 
reported the reportable event within the 
30-day reporting period, CMS or our 
designated contractor would impose an 
overpayment, if applicable, and revoke 
billing privileges for a period of not less 
than one year. 
5. Maintaining Ordering and Referring 
Documentation 
We are proposing to add a new 
§ 424.516(f) that would specify, ‘‘A 
provider or supplier is required to 
maintain ordering and referring 
documentation, including the NPI, 
received from a physician or eligible 
NPP. Physicians and NPPs are required 
to maintain written ordering and 
referring documentation for 10 years 
from the date of service.’’ We believe 
that it is essential that providers and 
suppliers maintain documentation 
regarding the specific service ordered or 
referred to a Medicare beneficiary by a 
physician or NPP as defined in section 
1842(b)(18)(c) of the Act (which 
includes but is not limited to nurse 
practitioners, and physician assistants). 
We believe that ordering and referring 
documentation maintained by a 
provider or supplier must match the 
information on the Medicare claims 
form. Additionally, we are proposing to 
add § 424.535(a)(10) that would state 
that failure to comply with the 
documentation requirements specified 
in § 424.516(f) as a reason for 
revocation. For example, a lab submits 
a claim with Dr. Smith’s NPI 
(1234512345) in the ordering and 
referring section of the claim form. The 
number submitted on the claim form 
should match the documentation in the 
provider or supplier’s records. In 
addition, we are codifying the 
requirement to maintain ordering and 
referring documentation as required in 
the Medicare Program Integrity Manual 
(PIM) Publication 100–08, Chapter 5. 
While the PIM currently requires that 
providers and suppliers maintain 
ordering and referring documentation 
for 7 years from the date of payment, we 
believe that the industry generally 
maintains documentation from the date 
of service. Accordingly, since there may 
be a delay in claims payment for up to 
27 months from the date of service, we 
believe that it would be administratively 
less burdensome for providers and 
suppliers to maintain ordering and 
referring documentation for 10 years 
from the date of service, rather than 
requiring providers and suppliers to 
maintain ordering and referring 
documentation associated with the date 
of payment. 
We maintain that a provider or 
supplier should retain the necessary 
ordering and referring documentation 
received from physicians and NPPs as 
defined in section 1842(b)(18)(c) of the 
Act to assure themselves that coverage 
criterion for an item has been met. If the 
information in the patient’s medical 
record does not adequately support the 
medical necessity for the item, the 
supplier would be liable for the dollar 
amount involved unless a properly 
executed Advance Beneficiary Notice of 
possible denial has been obtained. 
6. Revocation of Enrollment and Billing 
Privileges in the Medicare Program 
(proposed § 424.535(g)) 
Historically, we have allowed 
providers and suppliers whose 
Medicare billing numbers have been 
revoked to continue billing for services 
furnished prior to revocation for up to 
27 months after the effective date of the 
revocation. Since we believe this 
extensive billing period poses 
significant risk to Medicare program, we 
are proposing to limit the claims 
submission timeframe after revocation. 
In § 424.535(g), we are proposing that 
revoked physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners, including physicians and 
NPPs, must submit all outstanding 
claims not previously submitted within 
30 calendar days of the revocation 
effective date. We maintain that this 
change is necessary to limit the 
Medicare program exposure to future 
vulnerabilities from physician and NPP 
organizations and individual 
practitioners that have had their billing 
privileges revoked. We know that some 
physician and NPP organizations and 
individual practitioners are able to 
create false documentation to support 
claims payment. Accordingly, this 
proposed change would allow a 
Medicare contractor to conduct focused 
medical review on the claims submitted 
during the claims filing period to ensure 
that each claim is supported by medical 
documentation that the contractor can 
verify. We maintain that focused 
medical review of these claims will 
ensure that Medicare only pays for 
furnished services by a physician 
organization or individual practitioner 
and that these entities and individuals 
receive payment in a timely manner. 
Since a physician organization or 
individual practitioner generally submit 
claims on a nexus to the date of service, 
we believe that this proposed change 
will not impose a significant burden on 
physician organizations or individual 
practitioners. In addition, we are also 
proposing to add § 424.44(a)(3) to 
account for this provision related to the 
requirements for the timely filing of 
claims. 
7. Technical Changes to Regulations 
Text 
We propose to make the following 
technical changes: 
• Existing § 424.510(d)(8) would be 
redesignated as § 424.517. This 
proposed revision would separate our 
ability to conduct onsite reviews from 
the provider and supplier enrollment 
requirements. 
• Existing § 424.520 would be revised 
and redesignated as § 424.516. This 
proposed redesignation would move the 
additional provider and supplier 
enrollment requirements so that these 
requirements immediately follow the 
provider and supplier enrollment 
requirements. 
• In new § 424.520, we would specify 
the effective dates for Medicare billing 
privileges for the following entities: 
Surveyed, certified, or accredited 
providers and suppliers; IDTFs; and 
DMEPOS suppliers. 
• In § 424.530, the phrase ‘‘in the 
Medicare program’’ would be added to 
the section heading to remain consistent 
with other headings in the subpart.

Exemption for Computer-Generated 
Facsimile Transmission From the

Programs (NCPDP) SCRIPT Standard for

38540 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
1. Legislative History 
Section 101 of the MMA amended 
title XVIII of the Act to establish a 
voluntary prescription drug benefit 
program. Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) 
sponsors and Medicare Advantage (MA) 
organizations offering Medicare 
Advantage-Prescription Drug Plans 
(MA-PDs) and other Medicare Part D 
sponsors are required to establish 
electronic prescription drug programs to 
provide for electronic transmittal of 
certain information to the prescribing 
provider and dispensing pharmacy and 
dispenser. This includes information 
about eligibility, benefits (including 
drugs included in the applicable 
formulary, any tiered formulary 
structure and any requirements for prior 
authorization), the drug being 
prescribed or dispensed and other drugs 
listed in the medication history, as well 
as the availability of lower cost, 
therapeutically appropriate alternatives 
(if any) for the drug prescribed. Section 
101 of the MMA established section 
1860D–4(e)(4)(D) of the Act, which 
directed the Secretary to issue uniform 
standards for the electronic 
transmission of such data. 
There is no requirement that 
prescribers or dispensers implement e- 
prescribing. However, prescribers and 
dispensers who electronically transmit 
prescription and certain other 
prescription-related information for 
covered drugs prescribed for Medicare 
Part D eligible individuals, directly or 
through an intermediary, are required to 
comply with any applicable final 
standards that are in effect. For a 
complete discussion of the statutory 
basis for the e-prescribing portions of 
this proposed rule and the statutory 
requirements at section 1860D–4(e) of 
the Act, please refer to the 
‘‘Background’’ section of the E- 
Prescribing and the Prescription Drug 
Program proposed rule published in the 
February 4, 2005 Federal Register (70 
FR 6256) 
2. Regulatory History 
a. Foundation Standards and Exemption 
for Computer-Generated Facsimiles 
(Faxes) 
In the E-Prescribing and the 
Prescription Drug Program final rule (70 
FR 67568, November 7, 2005), we 
adopted the National Council for 
Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) 
SCRIPT standard, Implementation 
Guide, Version 5, Release 0 (Version 
5.0), May 12, 2004, excluding the 
Prescription Fill Status Notification 
Transaction (and its three business cases 
which include the following: 
Prescription Fill Status Notification 
Transaction-Filled; Prescription Fill 
Status Notification Transaction-Not 
Filled; and Prescription Fill Status 
Notification Transaction-Partial Fill) 
hereafter referred to as ‘‘NCPDP SCRIPT 
5.0,’’ as the standard for communicating 
prescriptions and prescription-related 
information between prescribers and 
dispensers. Subsequently, in the June 
23, 2006 Federal Register (71 FR 
36020), we published an interim final 
rule with comment period (IFC) that 
maintained NCPDP SCRIPT 5.0 as the 
adopted standard, but allowed for the 
voluntary use of a subsequent backward 
compatible version of the standard, 
NCPDP SCRIPT 8.1. In the April 7, 2008 
Federal Register , we published a final 
rule (73 FR 18918) that finalized the 
June 23, 2006 IFC; effective April 1, 
2009, we will retire the NCPDP SCRIPT 
5.0 and adopt NCPDP SCRIPT 8.1 as the 
standard. Hereafter we refer to these 
standards as ‘‘NCPDP SCRIPT.’’ 
The November 7, 2005 final rule also 
established an exemption to the 
requirement to utilize the NCPDP 
SCRIPT standard for entities that 
transmit prescriptions or prescription- 
related information for Part D covered 
drugs prescribed for Part D eligible 
individuals by means of computer- 
generated facsimiles (faxes generated by 
one computer and electronically 
transmitted to another computer or fax 
machine which prints out or displays an 
image of the prescription or 
prescription-related information). 
Providers and dispensers who use this 
technology are not compliant with the 
NCPDP SCRIPT standard. The 
exemption was intended to allow such 
providers and dispensers time to 
upgrade to software that utilizes the 
NCPDP SCRIPT standard, rather than 
forcing them to revert to paper 
prescribing. 
b. Amendment of Exemption 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38194), we proposed to revise 
§ 423.160(a)(3)(i) to eliminate the 
computer-generated fax exemption to 
the NCPDP SCRIPT standard for the 
communication of prescription or 
certain prescription-related information 
between prescribers and dispensers for 
the transactions specified in 
§ 423.160(b)(1)(i) through (xii). 
Since computer-generated faxing 
retains some of the disadvantages of 
paper prescribing (for example, the 
administrative cost of keying the 
prescription into the pharmacy system 
and the related potential for data entry 
errors that may impact patient safety), 
we believed it was important to take 
steps to encourage prescribers and 
dispensers to move toward use of 
NCPDP SCRIPT. We believed the 
elimination of the computer-generated 
fax exemption would encourage 
prescribers and dispensers using this 
computer-generated fax technology to, 
where available, utilize true e- 
prescribing (electronic data interchange 
using the NCPDP SCRIPT standard) 
capabilities. 
We also believed that it might 
encourage those without such 
capabilities to upgrade their current 
software products, or, where upgrades 
are not available, to switch to new 
products that would enable true e- 
prescribing. In addition, because the 
elimination of the computer-generated 
facsimile exemption would encourage 
those prescribers that are already using 
e-prescribing software that is capable of 
true e-prescribing to utilize those 
capabilities, we believed that the 
elimination of the computer-generated 
fax exemption would increase the 
number of NCPDP SCRIPT transactions 
fairly significantly in a relatively short 
time period, and that this could, in turn, 
create a ‘‘tipping point’’ that could 
create economic incentives for 
independent pharmacies to adopt 
NCPDP SCRIPT capable software to 
begin to exchange true e-prescribing 
transactions with their prescriber 
partners. 
We proposed to eliminate the 
computer-generated fax exemption 
effective 1 year after the effective date 
of the CY 2008 PFS final rule (that is, 
January 1, 2009). We believed that this 
would provide sufficient notice to 
prescribers and dispensers who would 
need to implement or upgrade e- 
prescribing software to look for products 
and upgrades that are capable of 
generating and receiving transactions 
that utilize NCPDP SCRIPT. It would 
also afford current e-prescribers time to 
work with their trading partners to 
eventually eliminate computer-to-fax 
transactions. We also believed the 
elimination of the exemption for 
computer-generated faxing would 
encourage e-prescribers and dispensers 
to move as quickly as possible to use of 
the NCPDP SCRIPT standard with what 
we perceived to be minimal impact. 
We solicited comments on the impact 
of the proposed elimination of this 
exemption. Several commenters 
concurred with our proposal to 
eliminate the exemption for computer- 
generated faxes. The commenters 
indicated that lifting the exemption for 
computer-generated faxes would act as 
an incentive to move prescribers and 
dispensers toward true e-prescribing 
(electronic data interchange using the 
NCPDP SCRIPT standard). Less than 
half of the commenters disagreed with

38541 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
our proposal to eliminate the 
exemptions for computer-generated 
faxes, citing concerns about increased 
hardware/software costs, transaction 
fees, certification and other activation 
costs. Some commenters agreed that 
many prescribers who are already e- 
prescribing likely already possessed the 
ability to generate NCPDP SCRIPT 
compliant transactions using their 
software or could comply by obtaining 
a version upgrade under their 
maintenance agreements. Many 
commenters suggested that we continue 
to allow for the use of computer- 
generated faxes in the case of 
transmission failure and network 
outages. 
During the CY 2008 PFS proposed 
rule comment period, we received 
several comments that indicated that the 
elimination of the exemption could be 
problematic in certain e-prescribing 
transactions, namely prescription refill 
requests, but only one of those 
commenters offered substantiation to 
support this assertion. Absent receipt of 
substantial industry feedback on the 
impact of the elimination of computer- 
generated facsimiles on prescription 
refill requests, and not considering these 
comments about prescription refill 
requests to constitute widespread 
concern regarding the prescription refill 
request function, in the CY 2008 PFS 
final rule with comment period (72 FR 
66396), we amended the exemption to 
permit the use of computer-generated 
facsimiles only in cases of temporary or 
transient network transmission failures. 
Taken in the aggregate, we determined 
that the 1-year time period was adequate 
time during which providers and 
dispensers would have the opportunity 
to convert to conducting true e- 
prescribing and that costs would be 
mitigated due to the growing volume of 
e-prescriptions and practice of e- 
prescribing, with a commensurate 
reduction in transmission, software and 
other costs during that 1-year time 
period. These changes were to become 
effective in January 2009. 
3. Proposal 
Following the publication of the CY 
2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period, we received additional 
information regarding how the 
elimination of the exemption for 
computer-generated faxes would 
adversely impact the electronic 
transmission of prescription refill 
requests. These commenters relayed that 
the elimination of the exemption would 
force dispensers who e-prescribe and 
use these transactions to revert to paper 
prescribing. These commenters 
substantiated their assertions by 
providing us with more specific 
information regarding the economic and 
workflow impacts associated with the 
elimination of computer-generated faxes 
that was not forthcoming in the prior 
public comment period for the proposed 
rule. We also received unsolicited 
comments on this issue during the 
comment period for the November 16, 
2007 proposed rule (72 FR 64900). In 
light of this new information, we are 
now re-examining this issue in this 
proposed rule. 
Dispensers have indicated that they 
use computer-generated facsimiles for 
the majority of prescription refill 
requests, in particular when 
communicating with prescribers that 
have not adopted e-prescribing. 
Currently, regardless of how the initial 
prescription was received by the 
pharmacy (that is, orally, via e- 
prescribing, telephone, paper, or fax) 
nearly all prescription refill requests 
from chain pharmacies to prescribers 
are sent electronically, either via an e- 
prescribing application or via computer- 
generated facsimile. When a 
prescription is received by a dispenser 
electronically, the prescription refill 
request is sent to the prescriber via the 
same technology. However, where the 
dispenser knows that the prescriber 
lacks e-prescribing capability or has not 
activated it, or where the prescriber 
does not respond to the request sent to 
his or her prescribing device, the 
prescription refill request is sent or re- 
sent via computer-generated facsimile. 
Commenters stated that the vast 
majority of computer-generated 
facsimiles sent today from prescribers to 
pharmacies are not electronic data 
interchange (EDI) transmissions, but 
usually prescription refill requests sent 
from pharmacies to prescribers who do 
not conduct true e-prescribing and, in 
many cases, do not engage in any 
electronic transactions at all. One 
national drug store chain estimates that 
it produces approximately 150,000 
computer-generated facsimile 
prescription refill requests every day. 
The workflow and process for filling 
prescription would be significantly 
disrupted if these computer-generated 
facsimile transmissions were prohibited. 
Dispensers and other staff would be 
forced to revert back to making phone 
calls or using a stand-alone facsimile 
machine to contact prescribers each 
time a refill is requested. Commenters 
indicated that not only is this 
counterproductive to the advances and 
efficiencies made in pharmacy practice, 
it would impose an undue 
administrative burden on dispensing 
pharmacies and pharmacists. 
In light of this additional information 
regarding the larger than anticipated 
impact of the elimination of computer— 
generated facsimiles for the prescription 
refill request transaction, we propose to 
further amend the computer-generated 
facsimile exemption to also allow for an 
exemption from the NCPDP SCRIPT 
standards for electronic prescription 
refill request transactions that are 
conducted by computer-generated 
facsimiles when the prescriber is 
incapable of receiving electronic 
transmissions using the NCPDP SCRIPT 
standard. We propose to retain the 
current exemption in instances of 
temporary network transmission 
failures. We propose that this change 
will be effective January 1, 2009. We 
will periodically revisit the exemption 
for the purpose of ultimately 
eliminating it for the prescription refill 
request transaction as described in 
§ 423.160(b)(1)(vii), and solicit 
comments regarding what constitutes an 
adequate time to allow the industry to 
transition to the use of the NCPDP 
SCRIPT standard. 
We are also soliciting comments on 
the impact of the proposed exclusion of 
the prescription refill request 
transaction from this exemption. 
Specifically, we are soliciting 
information on any other e-prescribing 
transaction that may be similarly 
adversely impacted by the elimination 
of computer-generated facsimiles. As 
the use of e-prescribing increases, the 
need for computer-generated facsimiles 
in Part D e-prescribing would decrease, 
except in cases of temporary or transient 
network transmission failures. We 
believe that this proposal to allow 
computer-generated facsimiles for the 
prescription refill request transaction, 
and in cases of network transmission 
failures, would not slow the ongoing 
adoption of e-prescribing using NCPDP 
SCRIPT enabled transactions, and that 
the industry should continue to move as 
quickly as possible to use of the NCPDP 
SCRIPT standard.

38542 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66222 and 
66399), we revised the CORF 
regulations at 42 CFR parts 410 and 413 
to ensure that the regulations reflected 
the statutory requirements applicable to 
CORFs under sections 1834(k) and 
1861(cc) of the Act. Many of these 
changes were technical in nature. 
Specifically, the regulatory changes: (1) 
Revised the definitions of physicians’ 
services, respiratory therapy services, 
social services and psychological 
services, nursing services, drugs and 
biologicals, and supplies and durable 
medical equipment and home 
environment evaluation; (2) amended 
the payment provisions for CORF 
services; and (3) made other 
clarifications and changes to the 
conditions for coverage for CORF 
services. 
In this CY 2009 PFS proposed rule, 
we address the comments received in 
response to the CY 2008 final rule with 
comment (72 FR 66222), as well as add 
new provisions and revise some 
provisions. We welcome your comments 
on all of these proposed changes. 
1. Personnel Qualifications 
We stated in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period that we 
would propose updated qualifications 
for respiratory therapists in future 
rulemaking (72 FR 66297). It has been 
our policy that only the respiratory 
therapist (and not the respiratory 
therapy technician), who possesses the 
educational qualifications necessary to 
provide the level of respiratory therapy 
services required, is permitted to 
provide respiratory therapy in a CORF 
setting. 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period, we received a 
comment indicating that our regulations 
were outdated and did not conform to 
current respiratory therapy professional 
standards. The American Association 
for Respiratory Care (AARC) believes 
that the terms ‘‘certified respiratory 
therapist (CRT)’’ and the ‘‘registered 
respiratory therapist (RRT)’’ have 
replaced the terms ‘‘respiratory therapy 
technician’’ and ‘‘respiratory therapist,’’ 
respectively. In addition, the 
qualifications for CRTs and RRTs differ 
from those applicable to respiratory 
therapy technicians and respiratory 
therapists. The CRT designation is 
awarded after an individual successfully 
passes the entry-level respiratory 
therapy examination. In order to be 
eligible for the RRT examination, an 
individual must be a graduate of an 
advanced level respiratory therapy 
educational program and have obtained 
the RRT credential. 
For CY 2009, we are proposing to 
revise § 485.70(j)—setting forth the 
personnel qualifications for respiratory 
therapists in CORFs— to be consistent 
with current qualification requirements 
for RRTs, as recommended by the 
AARC. 
We are also proposing to delete 
§ 485.70(k), which sets forth personnel 
qualifications for CRTs (previously 
referred to as respiratory therapy 
technicians) in CORFs. In the past, we 
have not reimbursed CORFs for 
respiratory therapy services provided by 
respiratory therapy technicians or CRTs, 
and we believe that removing the 
technician definition would clarify our 
position. We believe that current 
medical standards continue to require 
that the provision of skilled respiratory 
therapy services to patients in the CORF 
setting be furnished by RRTs. While 
CRTs furnish general respiratory care 
procedures and may assume some 
clinical responsibility for specified 
respiratory care modalities involving the 
application of therapeutic techniques 
under the supervision of an RRT or a 
physician, the educational 
qualifications that a RRT possesses 
allow him or her to evaluate, treat, and 
manage patients of all ages with 
respiratory illnesses. RRTs participate in 
patient education, implement 
respiratory care plans, apply patient- 
driven protocols, follow evidence-based 
clinical practice guidelines, and 
participate in health promotion, disease 
prevention, and disease management. 
RRTs also may be required to exercise 
considerable independent judgment. 
This was implemented in the CY 2002 
PFS final rule with comment period (66 
FR 55246 and 55311) and the CY 2003 
PFS final rule with comment period (67 
FR 79966 and 79999) when we 
developed and discussed G codes, 
CORF respiratory therapy services, and 
specifically recognized the RRT as the 
appropriate level of personnel to 
provide these CORF services. Finally, 
the CORF regulations at § 485.58(d)(4) 
state that as a condition of participation 
for CORFs, CORF personnel must meet 
the qualifications described at § 485.70. 
For CY 2009, to maintain consistency 
in the conditions of participation for 
both CORFs, home health agencies 
(HHAs), and other outpatient service 
providers, we are proposing to amend 
the material addressing personnel 
qualifications in § 485.70. Specifically, 
we are amending paragraphs § 485.70(c) 
and § 485.70(e) by referencing the 
personnel qualifications for HHAs at 
§ 484.4. This change would align CORF 
personnel requirements not only with 
HHA requirements, but also with other 
regulations in Part 485 addressing 
provision of physical therapy, speech- 
language pathology, and occupational 
therapy services. We welcome your 
comments on these proposed changes. 
Also, at 485.58(a)(1)(i), we propose to 
amend the duties of a CORF physician 
to include medical supervision of 
nonphysician staff. This change 
conforms to changes made to the CORF 
conditions for coverage in the CY 2008 
PFS final rule with comment period. We 
believe that adding medical supervision 
of nonphysician staff to the duties of 
CORF physicians more accurately 
reflects the duties and responsibilities of 
the CORF physician. We also believe 
that this change could increase the 
quality of care provided to patients of 
CORFs. We welcome your comments on 
this proposed change. 
2. Social and Psychological Services 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66297), we 
clarified that all CORF services, 
including social and psychological 
services, must directly relate to or 
further the rehabilitation goals 
established in the physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, speech-language 
pathology, or respiratory therapy plan of 
treatment. We believe that using a full 
range of clinical social and 
psychological CPT codes to describe 
CORF social and psychological services 
is inappropriate because social and 
psychological CORF services do not 
include independent clinical treatment 
of mental, psychoneurotic, and 
personality disorders. CPT codes 96150 
through 96154 and CPT code range 
90801 through 90899 are inappropriate 
for CORF use because all of these CPT 
codes represent full-scale clinical 
treatment for these disorders. As we 
stated last year, we believe that for 
purposes of providing care in a CORF, 
social and psychological services should 
represent only case management and 
patient assessment components as they 
relate to the rehabilitation treatment 
plan (72 FR 66297 through 66298). 
Consequently, after notice and 
comment, we changed our policy and 
payment for CORF social and 
psychological services; these services 
may no longer address a CORF patient’s 
mental health diagnoses except insofar 
as they relate directly to other services 
provided by the CORF. 
We specified in the CY 2008 final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66298) that 
only the CPT code 96152 for health and 
behavior intervention (with the patient) 
could be used to bill for CORF social 
and psychological services. This code is 
part of a series of codes that was created 
by CPT in 2002 to address health and 
behavior assessment issues. These

services are offered to patients who 
present with established illnesses or 
symptoms, who are not diagnosed with 
mental illness, and may benefit from 
evaluations that focus on the 
biopsychosocial factors related to the 
patient’s physical health status, such as 
patient adherence to medical treatment, 
symptom management and expression, 
health-promoting behaviors, health- 
related risk-taking behaviors, and 
overall adjustment to medical illness. 
We also adopted the more limited 
definition of CORF social and 
psychological services, in our revised 
regulations at § 410.100(h) (72 FR 
66399). The regulations state that, social 
and psychological services include the 
assessment and treatment of an 
individual’s mental and emotional 
functioning and the response to and rate 
of progress as it relates to the 
individual’s rehabilitation plan of 
treatment, including physical therapy 
services, occupational therapy services, 
speech-language pathology services and 
respiratory therapy services. 
We also noted that a HCPCS G-code 
could more accurately describe these 
unique CORF services, but believed that 
it was inappropriate to create such a G- 
code in the final rule with comment 
period without first proposing to do so 
in proposed rulemaking. 
Therefore, for CY 2009, we are 
proposing to create a CORF specific G- 
code, GXXX5, Social work and 
psychological services, directly relating 
to and/or furthering the patient’s 
rehabilitation goals, each 15 minutes, 
face-to face; individual (services 
provided by a CORF-qualified social 
worker or psychologist in a CORF), to 
accurately describe the unique social 
and psychological services provided by 
CORF staff and to establish appropriate 
payment for these services. We propose 
to use salary and wage data from the 
Bureau of Labor and Statistics to 
institute a blended social worker/ 
psychologist clinical labor category 
using a price per minute rate of $0.45 
for the practice expense component of 
GXXX5. We would assign a malpractice 
RVU of 0.01. Because the services 
described by GXXX5 are solely 
furnished by a CORF social worker or 
clinical psychologist, and not by a 
physician, we would not allocate a work 
RVU for these services. 
We also propose to revise § 410.100(h) 
to delete the reference to ‘‘and 
treatment.’’ As discussed above and in 
the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66297), we 
believe all CORF services, including 
social and psychological services, must 
directly relate to or further the 
rehabilitation goals established in the 
physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
speech-language pathology, or 
respiratory therapy plan of treatment. 
Accordingly, social and psychological 
CORF services do not include clinical 
treatment of mental, psychoneurotic, 
and personality disorders. We are 
concerned that the phrase ‘‘and 
treatment’’ currently included in the 
definition of CORF social and 
psychological services may be 
misconstrued to include social and 
psychological services for the 
independent clinical treatment of 
mental illness. Therefore, we propose to 
delete this language in order to clarify 
that only those social and psychological 
services that relate directly to a 
rehabilitation plan of treatment and the 
associated rehabilitation goals are 
considered CORF social and 
psychological services. 
We also propose to remove 
§ 410.155(b)(1)(ii) regarding the 
application of mental health limitations 
to CORF social and psychological 
services. As stated, CORF services, 
including social and psychological 
services, must directly relate to or 
further the rehabilitation goals 
established in the physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, speech-language 
pathology, or respiratory therapy plan of 
treatment. In the CY 2008 PFS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66400), we 
stated that CORF services must be 
furnished under a written plan of 
treatment that indicates the diagnosis 
and rehabilitation goals, and prescribes 
the type, amount, frequency, and 
duration of the skilled rehabilitation 
services, including physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, speech-language 
pathology and respiratory therapy 
services. Section 410.155(b) specifies 
that the mental health payment 
limitation applies when there is a 
diagnosis of mental, psychoneurotic, 
and personality disorders (mental 
disorders identified by a diagnosis code 
within the range of 290 through 319) 
prior to beginning services. Under our 
revised definition, CORF social and 
psychological services must directly 
relate to the physical therapy or other 
rehabilitation plan of treatment and its 
associated goals. Since these patients 
are receiving CORF services because 
they have a need for skilled 
rehabilitation services, any social and 
psychological services provided in a 
CORF under § 410.100(h) must include 
an assessment of the individual’s mental 
and emotional functioning exclusively 
as such functioning relates to their 
rehabilitation plan of treatment. In our 
view, such services provided in a CORF 
are not ‘‘treatment of mental, 
psychoneurotic, and personality 
disorders of an individual’’ as set out in 
section 1833(c) of the Act, so that the 
statutory mental health payment 
limitations do not apply. We are 
proposing changes to § 410.155(b) to 
reflect our view regarding the limited 
nature of these services. 
3. CORF Conditions of Participation 
In the CY 2008 final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66400), we 
finalized changes to the CORF coverage 
and payment rules. However, all 
conforming regulations in the CORF 
Conditions of Participation (CoPs) were 
not updated at that time. 
We are proposing to revise 
§ 485.58(e)(2). Section 485.58(e) 
currently provides that as a CoP, a 
CORF facility must provide all CORF 
services on its premises with the 
exception of— (1) physical therapy, 
occupational therapy, and speech- 
language pathology services furnished 
away from the premises of the CORF, if 
Medicare payment is not otherwise 
made for these services; and (2) a single 
home visit for the purpose of evaluating 
the potential impact of the patient’s 
home environment on the rehabilitation 
goals. We are proposing to clarify that 
the alternate premises for provision of 
physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
and speech-language pathology services 
may be the patient’s home. 
4. Extension Location 
We are proposing to add a definition 
for an ‘‘extension location’’ of a 
rehabilitation agency to the definitions 
at § 485.703. While there are currently 
no provisions that allow rehabilitation 
agencies to offer services in an 
extension location, there are currently 
2,875 rehabilitation agency primary 
locations and 2,486 rehabilitation 
agency offsite practice locations. While 
our State Operations manual recognizes 
that these rehabilitation agency 
extension locations exist, it also 
includes language stating that the 
extension locations must meet 
applicable rehabilitation agency CoPs. 
However, it is difficult to apply CoP 
requirements to a location that currently 
is not identified in the CoPs. Creating a 
definition in the CoPs that applies to the 
extension locations will allow us to 
survey and monitor the care provided in 
these extension locations on a 
consistent basis. 
Therefore, we propose to define an 
extension location as: (1) A location or 
site from which a rehabilitation agency 
provides services within a portion of the 
total geographic area served by the 
primary site; (2) is part of the 
rehabilitation agency; and (3) is located

sufficiently close to share 
administration, supervision, and 
services in a manner that renders it 
unnecessary for the extension location 
to independently meet the conditions of 
participation as a rehabilitation agency. 
We welcome your comments on this 
proposed definition. 
5. Emergency Care 
We are proposing to revise 
§ 485.711(c), Standard: Emergency care, 
to reflect current medical practice. We 
propose to remove the requirement that 
the rehabilitation agency provide for 
one or more doctors of medicine or 
osteopathy to be available on call to 
furnish necessary medical care in case 
of an emergency. We do not believe that 
the patients serviced by rehabilitation 
agencies regularly experience medical 
emergencies that necessitate the 
retention of an on-call physician. 
Therefore, we are proposing the 
revised standard to require each 
rehabilitation agency to establish 
procedures to be followed by personnel 
in an emergency to cover immediate 
care of the patient, persons to be 
notified, and reports to be prepared. We 
are soliciting comments on this 
proposal. 
6. Technical Changes for Rehabilitation 
Agencies 
Under section 1861(p) of the Act, 
rehabilitation agencies are tasked with 
furnishing outpatient physical therapy 
and speech-language pathology services. 
Unlike CORFs, which provide 
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation 
services, rehabilitation agencies 
primarily provide physical therapy 
services. Some of the other services 
offered by CORF, such as respiratory 
therapy and social services are outside 
the scope of rehabilitation agency 
practice. 
The current definition of 
rehabilitation agency at § 485.703 
(paragraph (2)(ii) of the definition) 
requires that rehabilitation agencies 
provide social or vocational adjustment 
services. This requirement is outside of 
the rehabilitation agency’s scope of 
practice and has caused confusion for 
these providers because we do not 
reimburse rehabilitation agencies for 
furnishing social or vocational services. 
Accordingly, in § 485.703, we are 
proposing to delete the requirement in 
paragraph (2)(ii) of the rehabilitation 
agency definition requiring a 
rehabilitation agency to provide social 
or vocational services. We are also 
proposing to make a conforming change 
at § 485.717. 
At § 485.711(b)(3), we are proposing 
to remove the reference to § 410.61(e), 
since § 410.61(e) no longer exists in 
regulation. 
M. Technical Corrections for Therapy- 
Related Issues 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘THERAPY-RELATED ISSUES’’ 
at the beginning of your comments.] 
We are proposing the following 
technical changes to the regulations 
concerning therapy services: 
• In § 409.17(a), we are proposing to 
delete the reference to paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) which no longer exists. 
• In § 409.23, we are proposing to 
revise the title of this section from 
‘‘Physical, occupational and speech 
therapy’’ to ‘‘Physical therapy, 
occupational therapy and speech- 
language pathology services.’’ 
N. Physician Self-Referral and Anti- 
Markup Issues 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘PHYSICIAN SELF-REFERRAL 
AND ANTI-MARKUP ISSUES’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
1. Changes to Reassignment Rules 
Related to Diagnostic Tests (Anti- 
Markup Provision) 
a. CY 2008 PFS Final Rule With 
Comment Period 
The CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66222) 
amended the anti-markup provision in 
§ 414.50 for certain diagnostic tests. We 
revised the anti-markup provision to 
apply to the technical component (TC) 
of diagnostic tests that are ordered by 
the billing physician or other supplier 
(or ordered by a party related by 
common ownership or control to such 
physician or other supplier), when the 
TC is outright purchased or when the 
TC is not performed in the office of the 
billing physician or other supplier. We 
also imposed an anti-markup provision 
on the professional component (PC) of 
diagnostic tests that are ordered by the 
billing physician or other supplier (or 
ordered by a party related by common 
ownership or control to such physician 
or other supplier group), if the PC is 
outright purchased or if the PC is not 
performed in the office of the billing 
physician or other supplier. The anti- 
markup provision in § 414.50 applies to 
the TCs and PCs of diagnostic tests 
covered under section 1861(s)(3) of the 
Act and paid for under 42 CFR part 414 
(other than clinical diagnostic 
laboratory tests paid under section 
1833(a)(2)(D) of the Act, which are 
subject to the special billing rules set 
forth in section 1833(h)(5)(A) of the 
Act). If a physician or other supplier 
bills for the TC or PC of a diagnostic test 
that was ordered by the physician or 
other supplier (or ordered by a party 
related to such physician or other 
supplier through common ownership or 
control) and the diagnostic test is either 
purchased from an outside supplier or 
performed at a site other than the office 
of the billing physician or other 
supplier, the payment to the billing 
physician or other supplier (less the 
applicable deductibles and coinsurance 
paid by the beneficiary or on behalf of 
the beneficiary) for the TC or PC of the 
diagnostic test may not exceed the 
lowest of the following amounts: 
• The performing supplier’s net 
charge to the billing physician or other 
supplier. 
• The billing physician or other 
supplier’s actual charge, or 
• The fee schedule amount for the 
test that would be allowed if the 
performing supplier billed directly. 
In revised § 414.50(a)(2)(iii), we 
defined the ‘‘office of the billing 
physician or other supplier’’ as medical 
office space where the physician or 
other supplier regularly furnishes 
patient care. For a billing physician or 
other supplier that is a physician 
organization (as defined at § 411.351 of 
this chapter), the ‘‘office of the billing 
physician or other supplier’’ is space in 
which the physician organization 
provides substantially the full range of 
patient care services that the physician 
organization provides generally. (For 
purposes of the anti-markup provision, 
the office of a billing physician or other 
supplier has its common meaning—that 
is, it is space in which the physician or 
other supplier regularly furnishes 
patient care services, and does not 
include a ‘‘centralized building’’ as 
defined at § 411.351). 
We effectuated our changes primarily 
by modifying § 414.50, although we also 
modified § 424.80 by adding paragraph 
(d)(3) to alert the reader that, in a case 
of the reassignment of the TC and/or PC 
of a diagnostic test, the reader should 
consult § 414.50 to investigate whether 
the anti-markup provision applies to the 
TC and/or PC. We also amended the 
definition of ‘‘entity’’ at § 411.351 to 
exclude a physician’s practice when it 
bills Medicare for the PC of a diagnostic 
test in accordance with § 414.50. (Prior 
to the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period, the definition of 
‘‘entity’’ at § 411.351 excluded a 
physician’s practice when it bills 
Medicare for the TC of a diagnostic test 
in accordance with § 414.50.)

38545 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
b. Revisions to Payment Policies Under 
the Physician Fee Schedule, and Other 
Part B Payment Policies for CY 2008; 
Delay of the Date of Applicability of the 
Revised Anti-Markup Provision for 
Certain Services Furnished in Certain 
Locations (§ 414.50) Final Rule (73 FR 
404) 
Subsequent to the publication of the 
CY 2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 66222), we received 
informal comments from various 
stakeholders that stated that the 
application of the rule was unclear with 
respect to whether certain types of space 
arrangements meet the definition of the 
‘‘office of the billing physician or other 
supplier.’’ Further, some of these 
stakeholders stated that patient access 
may be significantly disrupted due to 
the alleged inability of physician groups 
to render services in a cost-effective 
manner if medical office space that 
satisfies the ‘‘same building’’ test in 
§ 411.355(b)(2)(i) of this chapter for 
purposes of the physician self-referral 
rules in Part 411, Subpart J of this 
chapter, and other medical office space 
in which patients are seen and that 
complies with the physician self-referral 
rules, are subject to the anti-markup 
provision in revised § 414.50. That is, 
physician groups stated that, in 
situations in which they are subject to 
the anti-markup provision and are 
limited to billing Medicare the net 
charge imposed by the performing 
supplier, they will not be able to 
continue to provide diagnostic testing 
services to the same extent that they are 
currently providing such services, 
because they will not be able to recoup 
their overhead costs. 
We were concerned that the definition 
of ‘‘office of the billing physician or 
other supplier’’ may not have been 
entirely clear and that it could have 
unintended consequences. Accordingly, 
in order for us to study the issues 
further, we issued a final rule entitled 
‘‘Revisions to Payment Policies Under 
the Physician Fee Schedule, and Other 
Part B Payment Policies for CY 2008; 
Delay of the Date of Applicability of the 
Revised Anti-Markup Provisions for 
Certain Services Furnished in Certain 
Locations (§ 414.50)’’ (the ‘‘Delay 
Rule’’), which delayed, until January 1, 
2009, the applicability of the revised 
anti-markup provision in § 414.50, 
except for anatomic pathology 
diagnostic testing services furnished in 
space that: (1) Is utilized by a physician 
group practice as a ‘‘centralized 
building’’ for purposes of complying 
with the physician self-referral rules; 
and (2) does not qualify as a ‘‘same 
building’’ under § 411.355(b)(2)(i) (73 
FR 404). We stated that, during this 
period, we planned to issue clarifying 
guidance as to what constitutes the 
‘‘office of the billing physician or other 
supplier’’ or propose additional 
rulemaking, or both. Because anatomic 
pathology diagnostic testing 
arrangements precipitated our proposal 
for revision of the anti-markup 
provision and remained our core 
concern, we did not delay the date of 
applicability with respect to anatomic 
pathology diagnostic testing services 
furnished in certain space (as described 
above). In addition, we did not delay the 
applicability of the revised anti-markup 
rule for the TC of any purchased 
diagnostic test. The anti-markup 
prohibition for the TC of purchased 
diagnostic tests is longstanding and was 
incorporated into the expanded and 
revised provisions of § 414.50. 
Accordingly, the regulation remained 
applicable to the TC of any purchased 
diagnostic test. 
c. Challenge to the CY 2008 PFS Final 
Rule With Comment Period and the 
Subsequent Delay of the Date of 
Applicability Final Rule 
On January 25, 2008, a group of 
plaintiffs filed suit against the Secretary 
(Atlantic Urological Associates PA v. 
Leavitt, Civil Action No. 08–141–(RMC) 
(D.D.C.), challenging the validity of the 
CY 2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period and the subsequent Delay Rule, 
and asking the Court to enjoin the 
application of the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period as to them. 
The plaintiffs included the following: 
(1) Three urology physician group 
practices that own pathology 
laboratories; (2) a self-employed 
pathologist who performs testing 
services for other physician groups; (3) 
Uropath, LLC, a limited liability 
company that manages various 
pathology laboratories; and (4) 
Uropath’s Director of Clinical 
Operations. The Secretary moved to 
dismiss the complaint for lack of 
standing and lack of jurisdiction. The 
Secretary agreed to withhold 
implementation of the anti-markup rule, 
as amended by the Delay Rule, for 
claims submitted between February 1, 
2008 and April 1, 2008, so that the 
parties could fully brief the issues. 
Subsequently, a preliminary injunction 
was granted by the Court until the date 
of its final order. 
On May 5, 2008, the Court vacated the 
preliminary injunction order and 
granted the Secretary’s motion to 
dismiss the suit. The Court found that 
the plaintiffs did not have standing to 
challenge the delay of the applicability 
of the anti-markup provisions for some 
arrangements. The Court further found 
that Uropath and its Director of Clinical 
Operations lacked standing to challenge 
either the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period or the subsequent 
Delay Rule due to the fact that they are 
not Medicare providers or suppliers 
and, thus, had no legally protected 
interest at stake. Finally, the Court 
found that, even if the plaintiffs had 
standing, the physician groups and the 
self-employed pathologist must exhaust 
the administrative claims process before 
the matter could be heard in Federal 
court. 
d. Specific Proposals 
As finalized in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period, the anti- 
markup provision applies to the TCs or 
PCs of diagnostic tests that are either 
purchased from an outside supplier or 
are performed outside of the ‘‘office of 
the billing physician or other supplier.’’ 
Here, we are proposing two 
alternative approaches for revising the 
anti-markup provision in § 414.50. In 
addition, we are seeking comments 
regarding any other possible approaches 
that would address our concerns 
regarding overutilization motivated by 
the ability of a physician or physician 
organization to profit from diagnostic 
testing services not actually performed 
by or supervised by a physician who 
should be considered to ‘‘share a 
practice’’ with the billing physician or 
other supplier. 
Under our first proposal, the anti- 
markup provision in § 414.50 would 
apply in all cases where the PC or TC 
of a diagnostic testing service is either: 
(i) Purchased from an outside supplier 
or (ii) performed or supervised by a 
physician who does not share a practice 
with the billing physician or physician 
organization (as defined at § 411.351). 
We would specify that a physician who 
is employed by or contracts with a 
single physician or physician 
organization shares a practice with that 
physician or physician organization. We 
believe that when a physician provides 
his or her efforts for a single physician 
organization (whether those efforts are 
full-time or part-time), he or she has a 
sufficient nexus with that practice to 
justify not applying the anti-markup 
provision as contemplated under 
section 1842(n)(1) of the Act. Under this 
proposal, a physician who is an 
employee of, or independent contractor 
with, more than one billing physician or 
physician organization would not 
‘‘share a practice’’ for purposes of 
§ 414.50 with any of the physicians or 
physician organizations with which he 
or she is affiliated.

38546 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
We believe that this proposal offers a 
simpler, more bright-line approach 
preventing potentially abusive 
arrangements while preserving the 
viability of nonabusive arrangements 
involving diagnostic testing facilities 
that might not be considered to be in the 
‘‘office of the billing physician or other 
supplier,’’ as defined under the current 
regulation (for example, a centralized 
laboratory staffed with full-time 
employees that is used by a physician 
practice with multiple office locations, 
sometimes referred to as a ‘‘hub and 
spoke’’ arrangement). We are not 
proposing regulation text for this 
proposal. 
We recognize that circumstances may 
exist under which it is beneficial, if not 
necessary, for a physician to provide 
diagnostic testing services to more than 
one physician practice. For example, a 
physician in one practice may contract 
to provide physician services on a 
locum tenens basis to another practice 
while a physician in that practice is on 
vacation or maternity leave. We are 
interested in comments regarding 
whether and, if so, how we could permit 
a physician to provide occasional 
services outside of his or her physician 
organization without the secondary 
arrangement precluding the physician 
from ‘‘sharing a practice’’ with his or 
her physician organization for purposes 
of applying the anti-markup provision. 
We note that we do not consider 
providing services at a free clinic or 
moonlighting in a hospital emergency 
department or as a hospitalist to be 
‘‘sharing a practice.’’ Such activity 
would not require the application of the 
anti-markup provisions with respect to 
the services the physician provides for 
his or her physician organization. 
Alternatively, we propose to maintain 
much of the current regulation text and 
its ‘‘site-of-service’’ approach to 
determine whether a physician ‘‘shares 
a practice’’ with the billing physician or 
other supplier. In other words, we are 
re-proposing to apply the anti-markup 
provision to TCs and PCs of non- 
purchased tests that are performed 
outside the ‘‘office of the billing 
physician or other supplier’’. We are 
soliciting comments on whether this is 
the best approach or whether we should 
employ a different approach. As 
discussed in more detail below in this 
section, we are also proposing to amend 
§ 414.50 to: (1) Clarify that the ‘‘office of 
the billing physician or other supplier’’ 
includes space in which diagnostic 
testing is performed that is located in 
the same building in which the billing 
physician or other supplier regularly 
furnishes patient care (and to make two 
other revisions to the definition); (2) 
clarify that, with respect to TCs, the 
anti-markup provision applies if the TC 
is either conducted or supervised 
outside of the office of the billing 
physician or other supplier; (3) clarify 
that a TC of a diagnostic test is not 
purchased from an outside supplier if 
the TC is supervised by a physician 
located in the office of the billing 
physician or other supplier; (4) clarify 
that, for purposes of applying the 
payment limitation in § 414.50(a)(1)(i) 
only, the ‘‘performing supplier’’ with 
respect to the TC is the physician who 
supervised the TC and, with respect to 
the PC, the ‘‘performing supplier’’ is the 
physician who performed the PC; (5) 
propose an exception for diagnostic 
tests ordered by a physician in a 
physician organization (as defined at 
§ 411.351) that does not have any 
owners who have the right to receive 
profit distributions; and (6) solicit 
comments on how to define ‘‘net 
charge’’ and on whether we should 
delay beyond January 1, 2009 the 
application of the revisions made by the 
CY 2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period, or the proposed revisions (to the 
extent they are finalized), or both. 
i. Definition of the ‘‘Office of the Billing 
Physician or Other Supplier’’ 
We received informal comments from 
various stakeholders who alleged that 
the application of the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period was unclear 
with respect to whether certain types of 
space arrangements meet the definition 
of the ‘‘office of the billing physician or 
other supplier.’’ In addition, some of 
these stakeholders stated that patient 
access may be significantly disrupted 
due to the alleged inability of physician 
groups to render services in a cost- 
effective manner if the anti-markup 
provision applies to arrangements in 
which diagnostic testing services are 
performed in the same building as, but 
in space separate from, where patients 
are seen. Stakeholders pointed to 
arrangements in which the office where 
a physician group sees patients is 
located on, for example, the third floor 
of a medical arts building, but the 
diagnostic imaging services are housed, 
for example, in the basement of the 
building. Stakeholders also cited 
arrangements in which two or more 
group practices in the same building 
may share a lab or other diagnostic 
testing facility in that building. 
After further review, we are proposing 
to clarify the definition of ‘‘the office of 
the billing physician or supplier’’ in 
§ 414.50(a)(2)(iv) to include space, in 
which diagnostic testing services are 
performed, that is in the ‘‘same 
building,’’ (as defined at § 411.351), as 
where the ordering physician or other 
ordering supplier regularly furnishes 
patient care (and more specifically, for 
physician organizations, in the same 
building as where the ordering 
physician provides substantially the full 
range of patient care services that the 
ordering physician provides generally). 
Note that the definition of ‘‘same 
building’’ at § 411.351 specifically 
excludes a ‘‘mobile vehicle, van, or 
trailer’’. Therefore, diagnostic services 
provided in the parking lot of a building 
in which a physician group sees 
patients would be subject to the anti- 
markup provisions. 
We are soliciting comments that 
describe current business arrangements 
(such as those that take place on a 
‘‘campus’’) and that suggest any 
additional or alternative criteria that 
would permit such arrangements to 
avoid application of the anti-markup 
provision while addressing our 
concerns for the potential for 
overutilization. 
We have received questions as to 
whether, for purposes of the definition 
of the ‘‘office of the billing physician or 
other supplier’’ a physician or other 
supplier may have more than one 
location at which it regularly furnishes 
patient care. We propose to clarify in 
§ 414.50(a)(2)(iv) that it may. In 
addition, some stakeholders responded 
to the requirement that, with respect to 
a billing physician or other supplier that 
is a ‘‘physician organization’’, the 
‘‘office of the billing physician or other 
supplier’’ is space in which the 
physician organization provides 
substantially the full range of patient 
care services that the physician 
organization provides generally. 
According to the stakeholders, a 
physician organization, such as a multi- 
specialty physician group, may not 
provide substantially its full range of 
services at any one location, but rather 
may provide substantially the full range 
of services for a certain specialty in one 
location, substantially the full range of 
services for a second specialty in a 
second location, and so forth. In order 
to address this difficulty for physician 
organizations, we are proposing to 
revise § 414.50(a)(2)(iv) to read ‘‘with 
respect to a billing physician or other 
supplier that is a physician organization 
(as defined at § 411.351 of this chapter), 
the ‘‘office of the billing physician or 
other supplier’’ is medical office space 
where the ordering physician provides 
substantially the full range of patient 
care services that the ordering physician 
provides generally. 
Examples of Application of Our 
Proposed Definition of the ‘‘Office of the 
Billing Physician or Other Supplier’’.

38547 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
We are providing the following 
examples in order to illustrate the effect 
of our proposals. For purposes of the 
following examples, assume that neither 
the TC nor the PC is purchased from an 
outside supplier. 
Example 1. A physician group practice 
treats patients in space located on one floor 
of a building, and, in that space, provides 
substantially the full range of services that it 
provides generally. The group practice 
conducts diagnostic testing on another floor 
of the same building. The anti-markup would 
not apply because the office of the billing 
physician or other supplier includes the 
space on both floors. 
Example 2. One or more physician group 
practices share space that is used for 
diagnostic testing and is located in the same 
building in which the group practices have 
their respective offices for seeing patients 
(and within those offices each group practice 
provides substantially the full range of 
patient care services that it provides 
generally). Again, the anti-markup provision 
would not apply because the office of the 
billing physician or other supplier (with 
respect to each group practice) includes the 
space on both floors. 
Example 3. A group practice treats patients 
in Buildings A, B and C. In each of its offices 
in Buildings A and B, the group practice 
provides substantially the full range of 
patient care services that it provides 
generally, but that is not true for space 
located in Building C. The group practice 
provides diagnostic testing services in 
Buildings B and C. If we finalize the 
definition of the ‘‘office of the billing 
physician or other supplier’’ to include space 
in which diagnostic testing is performed that 
is located in the same building as where the 
ordering physician or other ordering supplier 
regularly furnishes patient care, the anti- 
markup provision would not apply to the 
diagnostic testing performed in Building B 
but would apply to the diagnostic testing 
performed in Building C. 
We recognize that, unlike the first 
alternative proposal described above, 
our second alternative proposal may 
adversely affect certain ‘‘hub and 
spoke’’ and similar diagnostic testing 
services arrangements (see description 
above) in which a physician providing 
services in a centralized diagnostic 
testing facility owned by and serving a 
multi-site group practice has a 
significant nexus to the physician 
organization that employs or contracts 
with the physician. Therefore, we are 
proposing to provide an exception in 
§ 414.50(b) to the anti-markup provision 
that would be applicable to diagnostic 
tests ordered by a physician in a 
physician organization that does not 
have any owners who have the right to 
receive profit distributions. The 
exception would not apply to TCs 
purchased from an outside supplier, in 
recognition of the statutory command in 
section 1842(n)(1) of the Act and our 
longstanding rule. We are seeking 
comments as to whether the exception 
is sufficient to address any potential 
impediments to nonabusive ‘‘hub and 
spoke’’ arrangements caused by this 
second alternative approach, whether 
the exception is too narrow or too broad, 
and whether an exception to the 
application of the anti-markup rule 
under this second alternative approach 
is necessary at all. 
ii. Performed at a Site Other Than the 
Office of the Billing Physician or Other 
Supplier 
Section 414.50(a) provides that the 
anti-markup provision applies to the TC 
of a diagnostic test if the TC is 
performed outside of the office of the 
billing physician or other supplier. We 
propose to clarify that, if the TC is 
conducted outside of the office of the 
billing physician or other supplier, the 
anti-markup provision applies 
irrespective of whether the supervision 
takes place in the office of the billing 
physician or other supplier. We also 
propose to clarify that the anti-mark-up 
provision applies if the supervision of 
the TC takes place outside the office of 
the billing physician or other supplier, 
even if the TC is conducted in the office 
of the billing physician or other 
supplier. In other words, we would take 
the position that ‘‘performance’’ of the 
TC includes both the technician’s work 
in conducting the test and the 
physician’s supervision of the 
technician. Therefore, if either the 
conducting of the TC or the supervising 
of the TC takes place outside the office 
of the billing physician or other 
supplier, the anti-markup provision 
would apply. 
iii. Outside Supplier 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period, we defined an outside 
supplier as ‘‘someone who is not an 
employee of the billing physician or 
other supplier and who does not furnish 
the test or interpretation to the billing 
physician under a reassignment that 
meets the requirements of § 424.80’’ (72 
FR 66401). Subsequent to publication of 
the final rule with comment period, we 
received questions as to whether the TC 
of a diagnostic test would be purchased 
from an outside supplier if the 
technician conducting the TC is not an 
employee of the billing group but the 
physician supervising the technician is 
an employee or contractor of the billing 
group. We are proposing to provide in 
new § 414.50(a)(2)(iii) that the TC of a 
diagnostic test is not purchased from an 
outside supplier if the TC is both 
conducted and supervised within the 
office of the billing physician or other 
supplier, and the supervising physician 
is an employee or independent 
contractor of the billing physician or 
other supplier. We believe that the 
presence of the technician and the 
supervising physician in the office of 
the billing physician or other supplier, 
and the fact that the supervising 
physician is an employee or 
independent contractor of the billing 
physician or other supplier may 
establish a sufficient nexus between the 
supervising physician and the billing 
physician or other supplier so as to 
constitute ‘‘sharing a practice’’ within 
the meaning of section 1842(n)1) of the 
Act. We are providing proposed 
regulatory text in new § 414.50(a)(2)(iii) 
for this proposal. We are also making 
two alternative proposals (each without 
proposed regulatory text). We propose, 
in the first alternative, that if the TC is 
conducted by a technician who is not an 
employee of the billing supplier, the TC 
is considered to be purchased from an 
outside supplier, regardless of where the 
technician conducts the TC and 
notwithstanding the employment status 
of the supervising physician and the fact 
that the test is supervised in the office 
of the billing physician or other 
supplier. As a second alternative, we 
propose that, where the TC is conducted 
by a non-employee of the billing 
physician or other supplier and outside 
the office of the billing physician or 
other supplier, the TC nevertheless will 
not be a purchased test if the 
supervising physician is an employee or 
independent contractor of the billing 
physician or other supplier and 
performs the supervision in the office of 
the billing physician or other supplier. 
We note that, if we were to adopt this 
second alternative, the TC would still be 
subject to the anti-markup provision 
under our proposal that the anti-markup 
provision applies if either the 
conducting of the TC or the supervising 
of the TC takes place outside the office 
of the billing physician or other 
supplier, unless an exception applies 
(see section II.N.1.d.i. of this proposed 
rule). 
iv. The Performing Supplier’s Net 
Charge 
Section 414.50(a)(1) provides that, 
where the anti-markup provision 
applies, Medicare payment to the billing 
physician or other supplier is limited to 
the lowest of three specified amounts, 
one of which, in § 414.50(a)(1)(i), is ‘‘the 
performing supplier’s net charge to the 
billing physician or other supplier.’’ We 
have received comments concerning 
what the performing supplier’s net 
charge would be in the situation in 
which a physician in a group practice

supervises the performance of a TC but 
the group practice bills for the TC 
directly, that is, without a reassignment 
from the supervising physician. 
Stakeholders have questioned whether 
there are two suppliers, that is, the 
physician supervising the TC and the 
group practice billing for it, or whether 
there is only one supplier, that is, the 
group practice, given that the 
supervising physician is not effecting a 
reassignment. 
We propose to clarify that for 
purposes of § 414.50(a)(1)(i) only, the 
‘‘performing supplier’’ of the TC is the 
physician who supervised the TC, and 
the ‘‘performing supplier’’ of the PC is 
the physician who performed the PC. 
Therefore, where the anti-markup 
provision applies, the billing physician 
or other supplier would need to 
determine what it paid the physician for 
supervising the TC or for performing the 
PC. 
v. Specific Solicitation of Comments 
We are interested in receiving 
comments concerning the calculation of 
net charge for the PC when the anti- 
markup rules apply. In the CY 2008 PFS 
final rule with comment period, 
commenters objected that it would be 
difficult to calculate the net charge of 
the performing supplier. We stated that 
we did not believe that most suppliers 
would experience significant difficulty 
in calculating the net charge, despite the 
fact that some physicians are paid an 
aggregate monthly or annual amount for 
their services. In addition, we stated 
that suppliers could also choose to 
restructure their arrangements so that 
the anti-markup provision does not 
apply (72 FR 66318). Despite these 
responses in the final rule, we have 
received comments and questions 
concerning how to calculate the net 
charge. We are soliciting comments as to 
whether and how we should provide 
specific regulatory guidance for 
calculating the net charge. 
Commenters specifically stated that 
our decision to exclude the overhead 
costs of the billing supplier in the net 
charge would have a detrimental 
financial impact upon their practice 
and, ultimately, patient access to care. 
We are also soliciting comments on 
whether we should allow some 
overhead costs to be recovered by 
billing suppliers for services to which 
the anti-markup provision applies, and 
how our concerns about the potential 
for overutilization would be addressed 
if we were to allow some recovery of 
overhead. 
We note that several States have 
enacted direct billing laws, under which 
physicians (primarily pathologists) are 
required to directly bill payors for their 
services and are prohibited from 
reassigning their right to payment to the 
ordering supplier. We are soliciting 
comments on whether, in addition to or 
in lieu of, the anti-markup provision, we 
should prohibit reassignment in certain 
situations and require the physician 
supervising the TC or performing the PC 
to bill Medicare directly. 
Finally, we are soliciting comments 
on whether the revisions made by the 
CY 2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period should go into effect on January 
1, 2009, as planned, and whether any 
proposals contained herein that may be 
finalized should go into effect on that 
date, or whether some or all of the 
revisions should be delayed past 
January 1, 2009. 
2. Exception for Incentive Payment and 
Shared Savings Programs (Proposed 
§ 411.357(x)) 
a. Background 
The Medicare program and private 
industry stakeholders are increasingly 
exploring the benefits of various types 
of gainsharing, pay-for-performance 
(‘‘P4P’’), value-based purchasing, and 
similarly-styled programs that use 
economic incentives to foster high 
quality, cost-effective care. Many of 
these programs involve payments from 
hospitals to physicians. These payments 
potentially implicate the fraud and 
abuse laws, including the physician 
self-referral statute. Existing exceptions 
to the physician self-referral statute, 
while useful, may not be sufficiently 
flexible to encourage a variety of 
nonabusive and beneficial gainsharing, 
P4P, and similar programs. 
For this reason, as described in greater 
detail below, we are proposing a new, 
targeted exception to the physician self- 
referral statute for such programs. The 
design of the new exception presents a 
particular challenge: Crafting an 
exception that offers broad flexibility for 
innovative, effective programs, while at 
the same time protecting the Medicare 
program and beneficiaries from abuses. 
In reviewing various programs and 
industry suggestions, we have been 
struck by the considerable variety and 
complexity of existing arrangements, 
and the likelihood of continued future 
innovation in the structure and method 
of these programs. This variety and 
complexity make it difficult to craft a 
‘‘one-size-fits-all’’ set of conditions that 
are sufficiently ‘‘bright line’’ to facilitate 
compliance and enforceability, yet 
sufficiently flexible to permit 
innovation without undue risk of 
program or patient abuse. 
The variety and complexity of these 
programs make them potential vehicles 
for the unscrupulous to disguise 
payments for referrals or compromise 
quality of care for patients in the 
interest of maximizing revenues. 
Therefore, our approach to drafting a 
proposed exception is a cautious one. 
Our proposal is relatively narrow, and 
we acknowledge at the outset that it is 
unlikely to cover as many arrangements 
as interested stakeholders would like. 
As described below, we are considering 
various ways that we might expand the 
proposed exception, if we can do so 
without a risk to the programs and their 
beneficiaries. We are interested in 
public comments specifically 
addressing areas of possible expansion, 
the potential abuses that could occur, 
and the conditions necessary to ensure 
that such expansion does not pose a risk 
of program or patient abuse. It is our 
goal to promulgate an exception that is 
as broad as possible consistent with the 
statutory requirement that any 
arrangement excepted under an 
exception issued using our authority in 
section 1877(b)(4) of the Act pose no 
risk of program or patient abuse. We 
note that section 1877 of the Act is not 
implicated by quality or cost savings 
programs that do not involve 
remuneration to physicians. Hospitals 
are free to implement quality protocols, 
cost savings measures, and the like 
without regard to section 1877 of the 
Act, provided that the arrangements do 
not involve financial relationships with 
referring physicians. 
Although ‘‘gainsharing’’ is commonly 
used to describe certain programs that 
seek to align physician behavior with 
the goals of a hospital by rewarding 
physicians for reaching predetermined 
performance outcomes, several types of 
programs exist for the purpose of 
achieving quality standards, generating 
cost savings, and reducing waste. In this 
proposed rule, we refer to these 
programs as ‘‘incentive payment and 
shared savings programs.’’ We describe 
below in more detail the characteristics 
of programs we consider to fall within 
these categories. Successful programs 
often result in improved quality 
outcomes or cost savings (or both) for 
the hospital sponsoring the program. To 
achieve these goals, hospitals make 
financial payments to the physicians 
whose efforts contribute to the success 
of the program. As noted above, these 
payments may implicate the physician 
self-referral statute. 
Section 1877(a)(1) of the Act states 
that, except as provided in section 
1877(b) of the Act, if a physician (or an 
immediate family member of such 
physician) has a financial relationship

with an entity, the physician may not 
make a referral to the entity for the 
furnishing of designated health services 
(DHS) for which payment otherwise 
may be made under title XVIII of the 
Act. The provision of monetary or 
nonmonetary remuneration by a 
hospital to a physician through a 
gainsharing arrangement or other 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program would constitute a financial 
relationship with an entity for purposes 
of the physician self-referral statute. 
Incentive payment and shared savings 
programs also potentially implicate two 
additional specific fraud and abuse 
statutes. First, sections 1128A(b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of the Act, commonly referred to 
as the Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) 
statute, prohibit a hospital from 
knowingly making a payment directly or 
indirectly to a physician as an 
inducement to reduce or limit items or 
services furnished to Medicare or 
Medicaid beneficiaries under the 
physician’s direct care, and a physician 
from knowingly accepting such 
payment. Second, these arrangements 
potentially implicate section 1128B(b) 
of the Act (the anti-kickback statute) if 
one purpose of the quality improvement 
or cost savings payment is to influence 
referrals of Federal health care program 
business. 
i. Incentive Payment Programs 
‘‘Pay for performance’’ (P4P), also 
known as quality-based purchasing, is a 
quality improvement and 
reimbursement methodology aimed at 
moving towards payments that create 
stronger financial support for patient 
focused, high value care. There are 
many models for financial and non- 
financial incentives used in P4P and 
other quality-focused programs. We 
refer to these types of programs, which 
may be payer-based or provider-based, 
as ‘‘incentive payment programs.’’ 
Through collaborative efforts with a 
wide range of other public agencies and 
private organizations that have a 
common goal of improving quality and 
avoiding unnecessary health care costs, 
including the National Quality Forum 
(NQF), The Joint Commission, the 
National Committee for Quality 
Assurance (NCQA), the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality 
(AHRQ), and the American Medical 
Association (AMA), we are developing 
and implementing a set of P4P 
initiatives to support quality 
improvement in the care of Medicare 
beneficiaries. The objective measures 
used in incentive payment programs to 
determine whether providers are 
offering high quality care are commonly 
referred to as ‘‘quality standards.’’ This 
term is also used in many provider- 
based incentive payment programs. We 
use the term ‘‘quality standards’’ in this 
proposed rule as well. 
When payer-based, P4P attempts to 
use reimbursement to promote quality, 
efficiency in providing access to needed 
services, and successful outcomes. In 
many payer-based models, payers make 
available to hospitals financial 
incentives tied to achieving certain 
quality or performance goals (for 
example, adopting health information 
technology, furnishing preventive care 
services, achieving patient satisfaction 
targets, or measurably improving patient 
health indicators). Hospitals often need 
physician collaboration to meet 
performance goals. In order to align 
incentives, hospitals may want to share 
with physicians a portion of the P4P 
payments they receive from the payers. 
In the absence of or in addition to a 
payer-based incentive payment 
program, hospitals may also sponsor 
quality-focused programs in which 
objective improvements in quality or 
individual patient care outcomes are 
rewarded with payments to physicians 
responsible for the improvements. 
In both circumstances, payments 
made by a hospital to the physicians 
whose efforts promoted the achievement 
of targets (or benchmarks) for one or 
more performance measures create a 
financial relationship between the 
hospital and the physician that 
implicates the physician self-referral 
statute. These payments also potentially 
implicate the anti-kickback statute and 
the CMP statute. (We note that, 
depending on the nature of the 
performance measure, incentive 
payment programs might not implicate 
the CMP statute because they might not 
involve any reduction or limitation in 
patient care services.) 
Although properly structured 
incentive payment programs can 
enhance health care quality and 
efficiency, improperly structured 
programs pose significant risks of 
program or patient abuse, including 
adversely affecting patient care. 
Moreover, such programs could be 
vehicles to disguise payments for 
referrals, including incentives to steer 
healthier patients to the hospital 
offering the incentive payment program. 
Programs that cannot be adequately and 
accurately measured for quality would 
also pose a high risk of program or 
patient abuse. We observe that payer- 
based programs in which the 
performance measures are set by a 
wholly independent, arms-length party 
with a clear financial incentive to make 
P4P payments prudently may pose 
somewhat less risk than non-payer 
based programs, where there is no third- 
party payer that sets the performance 
measures and monitors compliance. We 
note further that payments made 
directly from a payer to a physician, at 
the payer’s sole discretion, may not 
implicate the physician self-referral 
statute or other fraud and abuse statutes. 
ii. Shared Savings Programs 
Many programs, such as 
‘‘gainsharing’’ and other cost savings 
and waste reduction programs, seek to 
align physician economic incentives 
with those of hospitals by offering 
physicians a share of the hospitals’ 
variable cost savings attributable to the 
physicians’ efforts in controlling the 
costs of providing patient care. For 
purposes of this proposed rulemaking, 
we refer to these types of programs as 
‘‘shared savings programs.’’ When a 
participating physician receives a 
portion of the cost savings attributable 
to his or her efforts in reducing waste 
and achieving the goals of a shared 
savings program, a financial 
relationship is created between the 
hospital sponsoring the shared savings 
program and the participating 
physician, and the physician self- 
referral statute is implicated. 
The Medicare Part A DRG system of 
hospital reimbursement, under which a 
hospital receives a prospectively 
determined, fixed payment that covers 
all hospital items and services provided 
to a Medicare beneficiary during his or 
her inpatient stay or outpatient service, 
provides a significant incentive for 
hospitals to control costs. Hospitals are 
also motivated to reduce costs because 
of the growth of managed care. 
However, because physicians are paid 
separately under Medicare Part B (and 
by many managed care and other 
payers), they do not share necessarily 
the hospital’s motivation to control 
patient care costs. Physicians who 
perform their professional services at a 
hospital use the hospital’s equipment, 
supplies and services, and prescribe 
drugs, devices and other items and 
services which the hospital must 
provide. In short, physicians are not 
financially at risk for the items and 
services that they use and prescribe, and 
therefore, do not have a financial stake 
in controlling the hospital’s patient care 
costs. 
As part of many shared savings 
programs, physicians study how 
colleagues perform their procedures and 
then determine the best processes to 
adopt, in order to increase efficiency 
while ensuring quality. In other 
situations, outside experts are hired to 
analyze hospital and regional or 
national data to determine appropriate

1 Although we refer herein to ‘‘shared savings 
programs,’’ the study cited referred to these 
programs as ‘‘gainsharing programs.’’ We retain that 
nomenclature for purposes of discussing the study. 
opportunities for cost savings that do 
not jeopardize patient care. Shared 
savings programs are sometimes 
described as collaborations between 
physicians and hospitals to determine 
the best approach to providing quality 
patient care services. Shared savings 
programs have been recognized by 
stakeholders as an effective means of 
controlling costs, improving efficiency, 
and promoting quality in the delivery of 
health care services. Government 
stakeholders have recognized similar 
potential benefits when shared savings 
programs are properly structured to 
ensure compliance with Federal health 
care program requirements. 
Empirical evidence suggests that the 
goal of patient care quality maintenance 
or improvement can be achieved 
through a properly-designed shared 
savings program. An independent study 
of data from 13 separate, 1-year 
gainsharing programs 1 designed and 
administered by the organization 
responsible for the design of all of the 
gainsharing programs that, to date, have 
received favorable advisory opinions 
from OIG (see discussion below and in 
the FY 2009 Hospital IPPS proposed 
rule (73 FR 23692 through 23693)), 
found that the incentives for cost 
reduction in the gainsharing models 
studied did not result in reductions in 
quality and, for certain quality 
measures, resulted in improved quality 
of patient care. (See Jonathan D. 
Ketcham and Michael F. Furukawa 
‘‘Hospital-Physician Gainsharing in 
Cardiology.’’ Health Affairs, Vol. 27, No. 
3 (May/June 2008), 808.) Specifically, 
according to the study, gainsharing 
slowed the growth of average in-lab cost 
per coronary stent patient, reducing 
costs relative to non-gainsharing 
hospitals; yet, in-lab complications did 
not increase during gainsharing, and 
three complications significantly 
decreased. (Id. at 808.) With respect to 
gainsharing’s positive impact on patient 
care quality, the authors of the study 
asserted that the economic incentive for 
physicians participating in gainsharing 
programs to collaborate in defining and 
adopting best practices might improve 
the physicians’ incorporation of clinical 
evidence into patient care 
decisionmaking. This is, at least in part, 
because the gainsharing programs 
studied provided participating 
physicians and physician organizations 
with information about other 
physicians’ practice patterns. (Id. at 
809.) 
Although properly structured shared 
savings programs may increase 
efficiency and reduce waste, thereby 
potentially increasing a hospital’s 
profitability and contributing to quality 
of care, improperly designed or 
implemented programs pose the same 
risks of program or patient abuse 
described above in connection with 
incentive payment programs. Additional 
risk is posed by shared savings 
programs that reward physicians based 
on overall cost savings (for example, the 
amount by which the total costs 
attributable to a particular hospital 
department decreased from one year to 
the next) without accountability for 
specific cost reduction measures. 
We are concerned about physicians 
responding to a shared savings program 
by limiting their use of quality- 
improving but more costly devices, tests 
or treatments (‘‘stinting’’), by treating 
only healthier patients (‘‘cherry 
picking’’), by avoiding sicker patients 
(‘‘steering’’) at the hospital, or by 
discharging patients earlier than 
clinically indicated either to home or to 
post acute care settings (‘‘quicker- 
sicker’’ discharge). We are concerned 
also about arrangements which provide 
for payments in exchange for patient 
referrals or result in unfair competition 
among hospitals offering shared savings 
programs to foster physician loyalty and 
to attract more referrals. We are 
concerned that, because of pressures 
from competition or physicians, 
hospitals may increase the percentage of 
savings shared with the physicians, 
manipulate hospital accounts to 
generate phantom savings, or otherwise 
game the arrangement to generate 
income for referring physicians in order 
to retain them for or attract them to the 
hospital. (These same concerns may be 
present with incentive payment 
programs.) We are incorporating 
safeguards into the proposed exception 
that are intended to address these risks. 
iii. DHHS Initiatives: Incentive Payment 
and Shared Savings Programs 
Patient care quality improvement is a 
laudable goal and a priority of the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services (the Department or DHHS). 
Patient care should be safe, effective, 
efficient, patient-centered, timely and 
equitable. Establishing partnerships is a 
critical step towards achieving our goals 
of improving patient care quality and 
avoiding unnecessary costs. Incentive 
payment and shared savings programs, 
when properly structured, by design 
establish such partnerships. 
Since 1991, we have sponsored a 
variety of demonstration projects and 
other initiatives to explore the 
connection between payments and the 
quality of care. These initiatives include 
the evaluation of both gainsharing (in 
various forms) and P4P programs 
affecting providers of health care to 
beneficiaries in diverse care settings. 
Although we decline to provide detailed 
descriptions of individual initiatives 
here, gainsharing demonstrations 
include: (1) The Medicare Participating 
Heart Bypass Center Demonstration 
which was conducted to assess the 
feasibility and cost effectiveness of a 
negotiated all-inclusive bundled 
payment arrangement for coronary 
artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 
while maintaining high quality care; (2) 
a 3-year demonstration under section 
1866C of the Act, which has been 
established, but not yet implemented, to 
test gainsharing models involving 
physicians, and collaborations between 
hospitals working with physicians, in a 
single geographic area to improve the 
quality of inpatient hospital care; and 
(3) a demonstration project under 
section 5007 of the DRA that would 
involve arrangements between a 
hospital and physicians and 
practitioners under which the hospital 
provides remuneration (to certain 
physicians and to certain practitioners 
(as defined in 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act)) 
that represents solely a share of the 
savings incurred directly as a result of 
collaborative efforts between the 
hospital and a particular physician (or 
practitioner) to improve overall quality 
and efficiency. In addition, we recently 
announced a new demonstration, the 
Acute Care Episode Demonstration, for 
hospitals to test the use of a bundled 
payment for both hospital and physician 
services for a select set of episodes of 
care (orthopedic and cardiac) to 
improve the quality of care delivered 
through Medicare FFS. We note that 
some of the demonstration programs are 
proceeding under a statutory provision 
that waived application of section 1877 
of the Act, the anti-kickback statute, and 
the CMP statute. 
In addition to these gainsharing 
demonstrations, we have developed a 
number of P4P and other value-based 
purchasing initiatives across patient 
care settings, including: The Premier 
Hospital Quality Incentive 
Demonstration; the Medicare Care 
Management Performance 
Demonstration; the Home Health Pay- 
for-Performance Demonstration; and the 
Better Quality Information Pilots.

iv. Potential Statutory and Regulatory 
Applications to Incentive Payment and 
Shared Savings Programs 
Section 1877 of the Act, also known 
as the physician self-referral statute: (1) 
Prohibits a physician from making 
referrals for certain DHS payable by 
Medicare to an entity with which he or 
she (or an immediate family member) 
has a financial relationship (ownership, 
investment or compensation), unless an 
exception applies; and (2) prohibits the 
entity from filing claims with Medicare 
(or billing another individual, entity or 
third party payer) for those referred 
services. The statute establishes a 
number of specific exceptions and 
grants the Secretary the authority to 
create regulatory exceptions for 
financial relationships that pose no risk 
of program or patient abuse. 
A financial relationship is created 
where an incentive payment or shared 
savings program results in a direct or 
indirect payment from the hospital to a 
physician. Unless the arrangement 
satisfies the requirements of an 
applicable exception, the incentive 
payment or shared savings payment 
would violate the physician self-referral 
prohibition if the physician receiving 
the payment makes referrals for DHS to 
the hospital making the incentive 
payment or shared savings payment. In 
many cases, incentive payment and 
shared savings programs can be 
structured to satisfy the requirements of 
existing exceptions (for example, the 
exceptions for bona fide employment 
relationships, personal service 
arrangements, fair market value 
compensation, or indirect compensation 
arrangements). In some cases, no 
exception may be necessary (for 
example, incentive payments paid 
directly from a payer at the payer’s sole 
discretion to a physician for the 
physician’s efforts in improving 
quality). However, in other 
circumstances, the existing exceptions 
to the physician self-referral prohibition 
may not be sufficiently flexible to 
protect payments to physicians under 
incentive payment and shared savings 
programs. 
As noted above, incentive payment 
and shared savings programs also 
implicate two additional specific fraud 
and abuse statutes—the CMP statute and 
the anti-kickback statute. An incentive 
payment or shared savings program 
could run afoul of the anti-kickback 
statute if one purpose of the payment 
from the hospital to the physician is to 
influence referrals of Federal health care 
program business. In contrast, the intent 
of the parties does not dictate 
compliance with the physician self- 
referral statute. If an arrangement fails to 
satisfy all of the requirements of an 
exception, it would violate section 1877 
of the Act. 
v. Solicitation of Comments in the FY 
2009 Hospital Inpatient Prospective 
Payment System Proposed Rule 
In the FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule, 
we solicited comments as to whether we 
should issue an exception specific to 
gainsharing arrangements, which we 
stated ‘‘typically refer[] to an 
arrangement under which a hospital 
gives physicians a share of the reduction 
in the hospital’s costs (that is, the 
hospital’s cost savings) attributable in 
part to the physicians’ efforts’’ (73 FR 
23692). Although we noted general 
concerns with arrangements that 
involve the use of a percentage-based 
compensation formula (as many 
gainsharing arrangements involve), we 
solicited comments regarding a 
potential exception to the physician 
self-referral prohibition for gainsharing 
arrangements in recognition of ‘‘the 
value to the Medicare program and its 
beneficiaries where the alignment of 
hospital and physician incentives 
results in improvements in quality of 
care’’ (73 FR 23694). Specifically, we 
solicited comments on the following: (1) 
What types of requirements and 
safeguards should be included in any 
exception for gainsharing arrangements; 
and (2) whether certain services, clinical 
protocols, or other arrangements should 
not qualify for the exception (73 FR 
23694). 
b. Public Response to Solicitation of 
Comments 
The following discussion describes 
comments received in response to the 
solicitation of comments on gainsharing 
arrangements that we have reviewed to 
date. In addition, we have reviewed 
comments received in connection with 
our proposal in the CY 2008 PFS 
proposed rule to revise § 411.354(d) to 
permit the use of percentage-based 
compensation formulae (such as the 
type often used for making cost sharing 
payments) for personally performed 
physician services only (72 FR 38184). 
In that proposal, we specifically noted 
that the revisions, if finalized, could 
potentially affect payment 
methodologies used in gainsharing 
programs. Generally, commenters 
strongly supported the establishment of 
an exception for gainsharing and other 
programs that compensate physicians 
and physician organizations for 
improving patient care quality and 
decreasing the cost of providing patient 
care when those achievements can be 
tied to the physician’s or physician 
organization’s participation in the 
program. Commenters urged that an 
exception contain safeguards to ensure 
patient access to necessary items and 
services, improve patient care quality, 
and avoid improper influencing of 
physician referral patterns due to the 
constraints or incentives of the 
program’s design. One commenter 
suggested that the availability of the 
exception be contingent upon the 
parties obtaining a favorable advisory 
opinion from OIG prior to the 
implementation of the gainsharing 
program. In addition, commenters 
requested that an exception provide 
flexibility to allow an entity to design an 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program that is specific to the entity’s 
goals and needs, as well as to modify 
the program as necessary. One 
commenter also provided 
recommendations regarding the types of 
cost savings measures (in addition to 
supply cost reduction measures) that 
should be addressed by the exception, 
as well as particular services, clinical 
protocols, and other arrangements that 
we should exclude from the protection 
of an exception for incentive payment 
and shared savings programs. The 
commenter suggested that an exception 
to the physician self-referral prohibition 
should permit more types of 
arrangements (and within additional 
medical specialties) than thus far have 
been explicitly approved in OIG 
advisory opinions. Specifically, the 
commenter urged that an exception for 
incentive payment and shared savings 
programs allow a program covered by 
the exception to reward: (1) Decreasing 
delays in patient care; (2) reconsidering 
ordering patterns for all types of testing 
and services (in order to reduce 
medically unnecessary services and 
reduce cost); (3) reducing consultation 
of other physicians when value is not 
added to the patient’s care through the 
consultation; (4) establishing long-term 
management of chronic patient 
conditions; and (5) using alternative 
care (for example, outpatient care 
instead of inpatient care). 
Specific recommendations for 
safeguards to be included in an 
exception for incentive payments and 
shared savings programs included: (1) 
Permitting the duration of the program 
to exceed 1 year (the term of the 
arrangements approved under the OIG 
advisory opinions to date); (2) requiring 
mechanisms to ensure that the program 
will not affect patient care in an adverse 
manner; (3) limitations on the amount of 
payments to participating physicians; 
(4) requiring periodic review of the 
impact of the program on clinical care;

(5) a written agreement that clearly 
identifies the services or actions for 
which payment may be made to the 
participating physicians; (6) permitting 
payments only for documented and 
verified quality improvement and waste 
or cost reduction; (7) determining 
compensation to participating 
physicians (or a formula for such 
compensation) prior to the 
implementation of the program or the 
physician’s participation in the 
program, and prohibiting modification 
to the compensation during the term of 
the arrangement; (8) requiring written 
disclosure regarding the program to all 
patients affected by the program to 
promote transparency and 
accountability; and (9) prohibiting 
payment to a physician or physician 
organization that is determined in any 
way based on a reduction in the length 
of stay for hospital patients. 
c. Proposal 
Although we solicited comments in 
the FY 2009 IPPS proposed rule 
regarding an exception to the physician 
self-referral prohibition for gainsharing 
arrangements (73 FR 23692), we believe 
that a broader exception that includes 
incentive payment programs is needed 
to facilitate the full array of nonabusive, 
beneficial incentive payment and shared 
savings programs that we consider 
important for promoting the highest 
quality of care for our beneficiaries 
while achieving cost savings for the 
program. Section 1877(b)(4) of the Act 
authorizes the Secretary to create 
regulatory exceptions for financial 
relationships that he determines do not 
pose a risk of program or patient abuse. 
Therefore, using our authority under 
section 1877(b)(4) of the Act, we are 
proposing here an exception in new 
§ 411.357(x) for payments provided to a 
physician participant in an incentive 
payment or shared savings program that 
includes certain safeguards and satisfies 
certain conditions. 
i. General Considerations With Respect 
to the Proposed Exception 
As we described above in greater 
detail, we have concerns about 
physicians responding to incentive 
payment and shared savings programs 
by stinting, cherry picking, steering, and 
making quicker-sicker discharges. The 
criteria included in the proposed 
exception are focused on three aspects 
that we consider critical to a properly 
structured, nonabusive incentive 
payment or shared savings program: 
transparency, quality controls (for 
example, controls to prevent reductions 
in resource utilization that lead to a 
diminution in quality), and safeguards 
against payments for referrals (or 
influencing referrals). We are proposing 
requirements with respect to the 
structure of the incentive payment and 
shared savings program itself, 
limitations and conditions regarding the 
payments provided to the physicians 
participating in the program, and 
requirements for the arrangement 
between the hospital and the physicians 
participating in the program. We are 
seeking comments on each requirement 
in the exception, as well as comments 
regarding the exception in its entirety. 
With respect to the latter, we are 
interested in comments regarding the 
effect of incentive payment and shared 
savings programs on marketplace 
competition, specifically with regard to 
whether shared savings programs that 
include product standardization 
measures disadvantage small 
manufacturers of items, supplies and 
devices due to the selection and 
preferred utilization of a limited number 
of items, supplies and devices included 
in the shared savings program, the 
ordering of which qualifies for program 
payments. (We note that, although we 
expect that the initial selection of the 
preferred products would be based on 
clinical efficacy, safety and medical 
appropriateness, we recognize that the 
final selection of products in a product 
standardization program is likely to be 
based on price when quality and utility 
are comparable). We are interested in 
comments on how product 
standardization can be achieved without 
limiting patient access to items, 
supplies and devices considered 
beneficial to improved patient care. We 
are also concerned about the potential 
for fraud and abuse if manufacturers 
attempt to influence the design or 
implementation of hospital incentive 
payment or shared savings programs. 
We note that, for most of the 
requirements and safeguards discussed 
in this proposal, we have proposed 
regulation text. However, we have not 
provided proposed regulation text for a 
limited number of the proposed 
requirements and safeguards described, 
but rather have solicited comments 
regarding how best to incorporate them 
into the regulatory text of the exception. 
We are proposing a single set of 
requirements that would apply equally 
to incentive payment and shared 
savings programs. In many cases, 
programs may include both patient care 
quality measures and cost savings 
measures, or a particular performance 
measure may be both a quality measure 
and cost savings measure. We believe 
that one set of requirements would ease 
administration and assist with hospitals’ 
and physicians’ compliance efforts. 
Further, similar risks of program or 
patient abuse exist regardless of whether 
a hospital pays a physician a share of its 
internal cost savings, a share of external 
funds earned by meeting quality goals 
(in a payer-sponsored program), or a 
share of its general revenues to promote 
quality. We are interested in comments 
with respect to whether separate 
exceptions for incentive payment 
programs and shared savings programs 
would be preferable and, if so, how they 
should be structured, and which 
requirements should appear in each. 
The requirements of the proposed 
exception include a number of program 
integrity safeguards, consistent with our 
longstanding concern, first noted in the 
Phase I final rule with comment period, 
that a patient’s choice can be affected 
when physicians steer patients to less 
convenient or lower quality items or 
services because the physicians are 
sharing profits with, or receiving 
remuneration from, the provider (63 FR 
1659 and 1662). We are also concerned 
about systems that incentivize the 
delivery of less expensive care at the 
cost of patient care quality and systems 
that limit patient access to beneficial 
new technology. The proposed 
exception prohibits payment to 
physicians based in whole or in part on 
a reduction in the length of stay for a 
particular patient or in the aggregate for 
the hospital operating the program. 
However, we recognize that reduced 
length of stay may occur as an 
incidental effect of quality improvement 
efforts. 
ii. Scope of the Proposed Exception 
As noted above, we used the term 
‘‘incentive payment and shared savings 
program’’ to encompass a wide variety 
of gainsharing and P4P programs. We do 
not propose to limit the exception to 
traditional gainsharing programs or 
supply cost/waste reduction programs. 
We are seeking comments regarding 
whether this approach is too limited or 
expansive, and whether different 
terminology would better describe the 
range of nonabusive programs we intend 
to cover under the proposed exception. 
Our proposed exception protects only 
incentive payment and shared savings 
programs offered by hospitals. It is our 
understanding that these arrangements 
are the most common, and, as described 
above, are the type with which we have 
the most experience. We are concerned 
that, unlike hospitals that are 
reimbursed on a prospective payment 
basis, other types of providers and 
suppliers that are reimbursed on a fee 
schedule or other FFS basis might have 
an incentive to create quality measures 
that mandate the furnishing of more

beneficiaries. In many cases, it might be 
relatively easy to characterize a program 
that offers beneficiaries more items and 
services as a ‘‘quality’’ incentive 
program, even in the absence of actual 
quality improvement. However, we are 
soliciting comments on whether 
incentive payment or shared savings 
programs (or similar programs) offered 
by other DHS entities should be 
protected and under what 
circumstances. In particular, we are 
interested in comments regarding the 
structure and design of non-hospital 
arrangements and the safeguards that we 
could include in an exception to meet 
the statutory standard of no risk of 
program or patient abuse. 
We are proposing to protect 
remuneration only in the form of cash 
(or cash equivalent) payments made by 
a hospital. Nonmonetary remuneration, 
such as additional staff members or new 
equipment, offered to reward 
achievement of quality or cost savings 
goals would not be protected. In 
addition, the proposed exception would 
be limited to payments to physicians 
who actually participate (‘‘participating 
physicians’’) in the achievement of the 
patient care quality measures or cost 
savings measures (collectively referred 
to in this proposal as the ‘‘performance 
measures’’) that are the subject of the 
particular program. We note that the 
physician self-referral statute applies 
only to physicians. Nothing in this 
proposal is intended to limit or prohibit 
the participation of NPPs in incentive 
payment and shared savings programs. 
Moreover, the participation of NPPs in 
an incentive payment or shared savings 
program would not require the 
protection of an exception to the 
physician self-referral prohibition 
unless the practitioner’s referrals are 
directed by, controlled by, or attributed 
to a physician with whom or for whom 
the practitioner works. 
We are proposing that protected 
payments could be made to 
participating physicians individually or 
to physician organizations composed 
entirely of participating physicians 
(referred to in this proposal as 
‘‘qualified physician organizations’’) (for 
example, a group practice composed 
entirely of cardiac surgeons 
participating in a cardiac surgery shared 
savings program could be a qualified 
physician organization). With respect to 
qualified physician organizations, we 
are considering whether such 
organizations could include physicians 
who are eligible to participate in the 
program, even if the individual 
physicians elect not to participate in the 
program (for example, a group practice 
composed entirely of cardiac surgeons 
could be a qualified physician 
organization in a cardiac surgery shared 
savings program, even if some surgeons 
elect not to participate in the program). 
As discussed further below, qualified 
physician organizations would need to 
distribute incentive or shared savings 
payments received from the hospital on 
a per capita basis to the physicians in 
the physician organization who 
participated in the incentive payment or 
shared savings program. In any case, 
payments made to physicians who refer 
patients to the hospital but do not 
otherwise participate in the program 
would not be protected. For example, 
payments to cardiac surgeons for 
changing their operating room 
procedures would be protected 
(provided that all of the other 
requirements of the exception were 
satisfied), whereas payments to the 
cardiologists who referred the patients 
for cardiac surgery but did not perform 
the surgery or contribute to the 
achievement of the performance 
measures through their personal efforts 
would not be protected. 
iii. Requirements Related to the Design 
of an Incentive Payment or Shared 
Savings Program 
To be protected, the incentive 
payment or shared savings program 
must be a documented program that 
seeks to achieve the improvement of 
quality of hospital patient care services 
through changes in physician clinical or 
administrative practices or actual cost 
savings for the hospital resulting from 
the reduction of waste or changes in 
physician clinical or administrative 
practices, without an adverse affect on 
or diminution in the quality of hospital 
patient care services. 
We are proposing to require that, in 
order for payments made as part of an 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program to qualify for the protection of 
the exception, the program must include 
patient care quality or cost savings 
measures (or both) supported by 
objective, independent medical 
evidence indicating that the measures 
would not adversely affect patient care. 
Specifically, all performance measures 
must use an objective methodology, be 
verifiable, be supported by credible 
medical evidence, and be individually 
tracked. The measures must reasonably 
relate to the hospital’s practices and 
patient population. In the interest of 
creating clear, bright-line rules, we are 
proposing specifically that patient care 
quality measures be listed in CMS’ 
Specifications Manual for National 
Hospital Quality Measures. In the 
alternative, rather than require programs 
to include the patient care quality 
measures listed in CMS’ Specifications 
Manual for National Hospital Quality 
Measures, we would deem such 
measures to satisfy that requirement. 
With respect to cost savings measures, 
we are proposing to require that cost 
savings measures included in the 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program use an objective methodology, 
be verifiable, be supported by credible 
medical evidence indicating that the 
measures would not adversely affect 
patient care, be individually tracked, 
and reasonably relate to the services 
provided. We are seeking comment 
regarding this approach and the 
described alternative for patient care 
quality measures in general, and we are 
interested specifically in comments 
regarding other appropriate performance 
measures (or lists of performance 
measures, particularly with respect to 
cost savings measures to the extent such 
a list might exist) that might be deemed 
to satisfy such a requirement if we 
finalize this alternative proposal, as well 
as whether parties could satisfy this 
requirement by including criteria 
deemed by the Secretary in an advisory 
opinion to meet the requirement. We are 
including this requirement to safeguard 
against programs that incorporate sham 
standards that are designed to reward 
physicians for referrals rather than the 
achievement of legitimate benchmarks 
for quality maintenance or improvement 
or cost savings. We believe that 
appropriate performance measures 
should derive from broad, objective, 
widely-recognized criteria and not 
merely result from the subjective views 
of the parties to the arrangement. We 
also are proposing a specific 
requirement that the program ensure 
that the quality of patient care services 
is not impacted adversely as a result of 
the program. 
We are proposing that an incentive 
payment or shared savings program 
must be reviewed prior to 
implementation of the program and at 
least annually thereafter to ascertain the 
program’s impact on the quality of 
patient care services provided by the 
hospital. We believe that such vigilance 
is critical to ensure that quality of 
hospital patient care is not impacted 
adversely. Under this proposal, the 
reviews must be conducted by a person 
or organization with relevant clinical 
expertise, and they must be 
independent medical reviews. By 
‘‘independent medical reviews,’’ we 
mean reviews by an individual or 
organization that is not: (1) Affiliated 
with the hospital operating the program 
under review; (2) not affiliated with any

participating physician or with any 
physician organization with which a 
participating physician is affiliated; and 
(3) at the time of the review, not 
participating in any incentive payment 
or shared savings program operated by 
the hospital. We are seeking comments 
specifically regarding the appropriate 
frequency for review of incentive 
payment and shared savings programs 
to ensure that quality of hospital patient 
care is not impacted adversely and to 
protect against program or patient 
abuse. We are also seeking comments 
addressing the circumstances, if any, 
under which the periodic review could 
be conducted by an individual or 
organization that does not fall within 
the definition of ‘‘independent medical 
review’’ outlined above. 
Any reviews would need to be 
objective, accurate and complete and 
result in written findings. We are 
proposing that the initial and periodic 
reviews should be contemporaneously 
documented, and that all 
documentation related to the incentive 
payment or shared savings program and 
the reviews thereof be made available to 
the Secretary upon request. We are 
further proposing that incentive 
payment and shared savings programs 
must provide for immediate and 
appropriate corrective action in the 
event a periodic review reveals an 
adverse impact on quality. Corrective 
actions could include termination of the 
program, removal of the relevant 
measure from the program, removal of 
the relevant measure from the 
calculation of physician payments, or 
termination of the physician from the 
program. We are considering whether 
corrective actions could also include 
modification of a performance measure 
and, if so, under what conditions. 
However, we would prohibit the 
discontinuation of a performance 
measure for the purpose of increasing 
the payment to the participating 
physicians in the next period. Also, 
although we do not want to encourage 
practice patterns that result in reduced 
or poor quality patient care, we do not 
believe it is appropriate to permit the 
discontinuation of a performance 
measure because the participating 
physicians are unable to earn a shared 
savings payment related to that 
measure. We are interested in comments 
addressing the appropriate corrective 
actions and how best to incorporate a 
corrective action requirement into the 
regulatory text of the exception. 
We are proposing to require that 
participation in the program be limited 
to those physicians who are members of 
the hospital’s medical staff at the 
commencement of the program. We 
believe that this would protect against 
abusive programs that serve as 
inducements to attract physicians from 
competing hospitals. However, we are 
soliciting comments on whether and, if 
so, how a physician who joins the 
medical staff at the hospital as part of 
the normal cycle of workforce demands 
for care delivery could be permitted to 
participate in an incentive payment or 
shared savings program (either 
individually or as part of a qualified 
physician organization, as described 
below) that began before he or she 
joined the medical staff of the hospital. 
We are also proposing that physicians 
participating in an incentive payment or 
shared savings program, or in a 
particular performance measure or 
measures within an incentive payment 
or shared savings program, must do so 
in ‘‘pools’’ of five or more participating 
physicians among whom the aggregate 
incentive payment available for, or cost 
savings that result from, the efforts of 
the physicians in the ‘‘pool’’ with 
respect to a particular measure would be 
shared on a per capita basis. A qualified 
physician organization could itself 
constitute an eligible pool, provided 
that it is comprised of at least five 
participating physicians. Otherwise, 
participating physicians in the qualified 
physician organization would need to 
be grouped by the hospital into pools of 
at least five participating physicians. 
The distribution of incentive payment 
and shared savings program payments 
must be supported by written 
documentation. As an additional 
safeguard, we are proposing to require 
that physician ‘‘pools’’ be formed at the 
commencement of the program. We are 
interested in comments about our 
proposal to require hospitals to create 
pools for purposes of physician 
participation in incentive payment and 
shared savings programs and the 
minimum number of physicians needed 
to comprise a ‘‘pool’’ that adequately 
reduces the risk of program or patient 
abuse. Specifically, we are interested in 
comments on whether and, if so, how 
we should address the ‘‘pooling’’ of 
funds for payment purposes in an 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program targeted at a specific medical 
specialty or hospital department in 
which the physicians on the medical 
staff in that specialty or department or 
in the physician organization total fewer 
than five physicians. 
We are proposing also that a hospital 
may not determine eligibility for 
physician participation in a program 
based on the volume or value of 
referrals or other business generated 
between the parties. We are also 
considering, and soliciting comments 
about, conditioning protection under 
the exception on the hospital offering 
the opportunity to participate in the 
incentive payment or shared savings to 
all physicians on the medical staff who 
belong to the department or practice in 
the specialty relevant to the program 
(for example, the opportunity to 
participate in a shared savings program 
for cardiac surgery would have to be 
offered to all cardiac surgeons on the 
hospital’s medical staff). 
To qualify for protection under the 
proposed exception, an incentive 
payment or shared savings program may 
not limit the discretion of physicians to 
make medically appropriate decisions 
for their patients, including, but not 
limited to, decisions about tests, 
treatments, procedures, services, 
supplies or discharge. Although 
incentive payment and shared savings 
programs may condition program 
payments on particular physician 
choices, to be protected under the 
proposed exception, such programs 
could not limit other choices for which 
physicians would not receive program 
payments. In particular, a hospital must 
not limit the availability of any specific 
item, supply or device, including new 
technology that is linked through 
objective evidence to improved 
outcomes and is clinically appropriate 
for a particular patient, and must permit 
individual physicians access to the 
same selection of items, supplies and 
devices that was available to them prior 
to the physician’s participation in the 
program. We are not requiring physician 
access to items, supplies and devices 
that were not available prior to the 
commencement of the incentive 
payment or shared savings program. 
Rather, a hospital must make available 
to a participating physician at least the 
same selection available to the 
physician prior to his or her 
participation in the incentive payment 
or shared savings program, which 
already may have been restricted by 
hospital policy, but without payment to 
physicians based on such situations. 
We recognize that some shared 
savings programs are designed to 
channel the physician’s selection of 
physician preference items toward a 
limited number of choices; however, we 
believe that, to safeguard the program 
and its beneficiaries against abuse, 
physicians participating in a shared 
savings program must have access to 
items or supplies that they deem 
medically necessary for an individual 
patient’s care. This would include new 
technology, provided that it meets the 
same Federal regulatory standards (for 
example, approval by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and

Medicare or Medicaid coverage 
decisions) as the items or supplies 
included in the program. By including 
this requirement, we intend that 
programs would ensure access to 
clinically appropriate new technology 
while, at the same time, protect patient 
safety. For example, if a program 
includes three alternative, FDA- 
approved devices for a particular 
procedure, the hospital sponsoring the 
program could limit access to new 
technology that is experimental (that is, 
not FDA-approved), but could not limit 
access to FDA-approved alternative 
devices/technology. We note also that 
items, supplies and devices in a product 
standardization program (that is a cost 
savings action under a shared savings 
program) should not be selected on the 
basis of a participating physician’s 
ownership or investment interest in, or 
compensation arrangement with, the 
manufacturer or distributor of the item, 
supply or device, or his or her interest 
in a group purchasing organization 
(GPO) that arranges for the purchase of 
the item, supply or device. In this 
regard, we would strongly recommend, 
and may require, that such physicians 
be barred from participating in any 
manner in the design or implementation 
of an incentive payment or shared 
savings program that involves items, 
supplies or devices in which the 
physician has a financial interest. We 
are proposing that a physician (or 
qualified physician organization) could 
not receive a payment under an 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program for the use of an item, supply 
or device if he or she (or the qualified 
physician organization) has an 
ownership or investment interest in, or 
a compensation arrangement with, a 
manufacturer or distributor of the item, 
supply or device, or GPO that arranges 
for the purchase of the item, supply or 
device. 
iv. Requirements Related to Payments 
Made Under an Incentive Payment or 
Shared Savings Program 
To reduce the risk that incentive or 
shared savings program payments might 
be used to encourage or reward referrals 
to the hospital or provide incentives to 
engage in other abusive practices, such 
as stinting or cherry picking, we are 
proposing that payments made to 
physicians participating in the incentive 
payment or shared savings program be 
distributed on a per capita basis. We are 
interested in public comments that may 
outline alternate approaches to the per 
capita payment model for the 
distribution of incentive payments or 
shared savings payments, such as 
paying a physician more or less 
according to whether he or she 
contributed more or less to the 
achievement of the performance 
measures included in the incentive 
payment or shared savings program. 
We believe that safeguards are 
necessary to ensure that incentive 
payment and shared savings programs 
do not result in altered referral patterns 
and to reduce the risk that programs 
will become vehicles used to reward 
referring physicians. To address this, we 
are proposing that remuneration paid to 
a participating physician or a qualified 
physician organization may not include 
any amount that takes into account the 
provision a greater volume of Federal 
health care patient procedures or 
services than the volume provided by 
the participating physician or qualified 
physician organization during the 
period of the same length immediately 
preceding the commencement of the 
program as that covered by the payment. 
We are interested in comments 
regarding whether and, if so, how to 
account for volume changes due to 
market forces and physician practice 
growth. 
We are also proposing that the 
amount of the remuneration paid to the 
physician or qualified physician 
organization be limited in duration and 
amount. With respect to duration, we 
are proposing that protected programs 
be no shorter than 1 year and no longer 
than 3 years. With respect to a limit on 
the amount of payments, we are 
proposing two types of limits, which we 
might adopt separately or together. 
First, we are proposing a limit on 
payments expressed as a set percentage 
of the savings available to the hospital 
as a result of the changes in clinical or 
administrative practices of the 
participating physicians. Although not 
incorporated into the proposed 
regulation text, we are specifically 
considering a flat 50 percent limit on 
the sharing of cost savings (regardless of 
the length of the program), and are 
considering whether to require ‘‘re- 
basing,’’ depending on the length of the 
program. We are interested in comments 
regarding whether this ‘‘cap’’ on 
payments is appropriate, too high, or too 
low. We are interested also in comments 
regarding whether and, if so, how we 
should limit payments under a multi- 
year incentive payment or shared 
savings program to an amount that 
would be actuarially equivalent to the 
amount of the payments made under a 
1-year program. We are considering also 
‘‘scaled’’ limits for programs longer than 
1 year. Under the scaled limits 
approach, we would not require re- 
basing (as further described below), but 
would require that payments to 
physicians decrease over the course of 
the performance measure. For purposes 
of calculating the actual payments to the 
physician, we are proposing that cost 
savings be measured by comparing the 
hospital’s actual acquisition costs for 
the items and supplies or costs of 
delivering the specified services that are 
subject to the incentive payment or 
shared savings program to the hospital’s 
baseline costs for the same items, 
supplies or services during the 1-year 
period immediately preceding the 
commencement of the program. 
Second, we are proposing a limit on 
payments to address the risk that 
physicians will continue to receive 
financial rewards for already 
implemented changes in clinical or 
administrative practices. This second 
limit would require that payments made 
under an incentive payment or shared 
savings program must take into account 
any payments that have already been 
made for performance measures already 
achieved (‘‘re-basing’’). We are 
considering a re-basing approach under 
which, at the end of year one, the 
hospital would re-base performance 
measures such that available payment 
would be based on the difference 
between the hospital’s then-current 
level for a particular performance 
measure and the goal established for 
that performance measure. This 
approach would apply similarly to 
incentive payments made exclusively 
for improvements in patient care quality 
that are unrelated to the achievement of 
cost savings. We are soliciting 
comments specifically as to whether 
requiring the re-basing of ‘‘quality-only’’ 
payments is a necessary safeguard 
against program or patient abuse, or 
whether a different approach for 
limiting such payments could be 
implemented that would safeguard 
against risk to the Medicare program or 
its beneficiaries. We are also soliciting 
comments on whether we should 
require re-basing at all and, if so, under 
what parameters and whether parties 
should be free to choose the frequency 
of the payment and re-basing periods 
under the incentive payment or shared 
savings program. In no event would a 
hospital be permitted to increase the 
incentive payment or shared savings 
payment potentially available to 
physicians as a result of the re-basing. 
By way of illustration, assume that 
one objective cost saving measure in the 
program is to decrease from 80 percent 
utilization of a specified item during a 
particular surgical procedure (the 
hospital’s historical utilization rate for 
the item) to 20 percent utilization (the 
national average for utilization of the 
item). Under an approach that requires 
re-basing, if, after completion of the first 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 18:46 Jul 03, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00055 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\07JYP2.SGM 07JYP2sro

year of the program, the hospital’s 
utilization of the specified item 
decreased to 60 percent of surgical 
procedures, for year 2 of the 
arrangement, the participating 
physicians could receive payment only 
for any reduction below 60 percent 
utilization of the specified item, that is, 
the new ‘‘historical’’ baseline utilization 
rate would be 60 percent and all cost 
savings and waste reduction for the 
upcoming year would be measured 
against the new baseline utilization rate. 
If, after completion of year one, the 
hospital’s utilization of the specified 
item increased to 90 percent, the 
hospital would be prohibited from re- 
basing the utilization rate higher than 
the initial 80 percent utilization rate 
determined at the commencement of the 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program. The participating physicians 
would, in the aggregate, be eligible to 
receive as a shared savings payment the 
same percentage of cost savings 
throughout the term of the program. 
Using the same figures, under an 
approach that requires scaling of the 
payments over the course of the 
arrangement, the physicians 
participating in the program would be 
eligible for a decreasing percentage of 
cost savings over the course of the 
arrangement. Assume, for example, we 
adopted an approach that permitted 
shared savings payments of up to 50 
percent for year one, up to 35 percent 
for year two, and up to 20 percent for 
year three. If a particular cost savings 
measure generated savings of $100,000 
the first year, $150,000 the second year, 
and $200,000 the third year (all relative 
to the historical baseline utilization rate 
established at commencement of the 
program), the participating physicians 
would be eligible for a total of 50 
percent of $100,000 (or $50,000) the first 
year, a total of 35 percent of $150,000 
(or $52,500) the second year, and 20 
percent of $200,000 (or $40,000) the 
third year. We are also considering 
protecting programs in which dollar 
limits are expressed as fixed dollar 
amounts rather than percentages. 
Each of the approaches described 
above could be adopted to the exclusion 
of or in concert with each other. We are 
interested in comments regarding 
whether the exception should include 
one or more of the payment limit 
alternatives, as well as comments 
regarding other appropriate limitations 
for the amount and nature of the 
payments made under an incentive 
payment or shared savings program. 
Regardless of which approach we adopt, 
we are proposing to require that 
payments based on cost savings be 
calculated on the hospital’s actual 
acquisition costs for the items at issue, 
as well as the costs involved in 
providing the specified services and that 
they be calculated on the basis of all 
patients, regardless of insurance 
coverage (subject to the cap on payment 
for Federal health care program 
beneficiaries described above). We are 
seeking comments regarding whether 
these conditions are appropriate and 
whether we should permit modification 
under other or different circumstances. 
We do not intend to protect 
arrangements in which physicians 
receive payments for actions taken that 
result in a reduction below a 
predetermined target. For example, in 
the first hypothetical (under the 
required re-basing approach), no 
payments could be made for reductions 
below 20 percent utilization. We intend 
to require that the target thresholds use 
objective historical and clinical 
measures that are reasonably related to 
the practices and the patient population 
at the hospital. We are mindful that 
some performance measures may not be 
amendable to such utilization ‘‘floors’’ 
or ‘‘ceilings.’’ We are considering 
including comparable safeguards for 
measures that may not be readily 
amenable to percentage ‘‘floors’’ and 
‘‘ceilings’’, such as measures related to 
product substitution and product 
standardization. For example, the fact 
that the substitution of one product for 
another would not adversely impact 
quality might need to be supported by 
substantial objective medical evidence. 
We are soliciting comments on what 
kinds of quality controls are appropriate 
for performance measures that are not 
amendable to utilization ‘‘floors’’ and 
‘‘ceilings.’’ We are considering whether 
and, if so, how this concern can be 
addressed by requiring that the parties 
obtain a fully independent clinical 
review by a qualified party of the 
program measures prior to 
implementing the program. We are 
soliciting comments on appropriate 
quality safeguards in such situations. 
We recognize that parties might want 
to structure arrangements so that 
payments are made by the hospital to a 
physician organization that would not 
meet our proposed definition of a 
qualified physician organization. This 
might be the case if incentive payment 
or shared savings payments are made by 
a hospital to a multi-specialty physician 
practice composed of participating and 
non-participating physicians (for 
example, a group composed of cardiac 
surgeons and cardiologists, in the case 
of a cardiac surgery shared savings 
program). We are considering whether 
to extend the proposed exception to 
cover payments from a hospital to such 
physician organizations and, if so, 
under what conditions we could do so 
that would pose no risk of program or 
patient abuse. We are concerned that 
payments made to such physician 
organizations may become conduits to 
reward non-participating physicians for 
referrals. On the other hand, we 
recognize that programs structured so 
that hospitals make payments to 
physician organizations rather than to 
individual physicians may be 
administratively easier for hospitals to 
operate. (We note that, in some cases, 
payments from hospitals to physician 
organizations that are not qualified 
physician organizations might fit in the 
existing exception for indirect 
compensation arrangements, depending 
on the circumstances.) 
We are considering several options to 
address this issue. First, we are 
considering an approach that would 
allow hospitals to make incentive 
payment or shared savings payments to 
individual physicians indirectly by 
passing the payment through the 
physician’s physician organization. 
Under this approach, the total amount 
of the payment earned by the physician 
under the incentive payment or shared 
savings program would need to be 
passed through to the physician, except 
amounts required for income tax and 
other regular withholding. Under this 
approach, the physician organization 
would simply operate as a pass-through 
entity. The physician organization 
would be prohibited from retaining any 
portion of the incentive payment or 
shared savings payment (except, 
potentially, for required withholdings to 
be paid on behalf of the participating 
physician). We are soliciting comments 
about this approach and what types of 
payments the physician organization 
could withhold (for example, whether 
the physician organization should be 
permitted to withhold required 
contributions to a qualified retirement 
plan). 
We are concerned about the difficulty 
hospitals might encounter in ensuring 
that the physician organization 
accurately and fully passes through the 
full payment to the participating 
physician, and we are concerned about 
the risk of fraud and abuse if the 
payment mechanism were manipulated 
so that the physician organization 
retains a portion of the payments for its 
own benefit. Such gaming of the 
payment structure could result in 
improper remuneration from the 
hospital to the physician organization 
for referrals (and would not fit in the 
proposed or any other exception to 
section 1877 of the Act). We are 
interested in comments about how to

38557 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
craft safeguards for the exception to 
prevent this type of potential abuse. In 
this regard, we are considering requiring 
that the physician organization 
document all amounts received and 
distributed to participating physicians, 
as well as any income tax or regular 
withholding payments made on behalf 
of the participating physician. In 
addition, we would require that the 
physician organization’s obligations 
with respect to ‘‘pass through’’ 
payments be included in the written 
agreement between the parties and that 
the physician organization be a 
signatory (in addition to the hospital 
and the participating physician) to the 
agreement. We are soliciting comment 
on these and any other safeguards 
necessary to ensure that payments are 
appropriately passed through to 
participating physicians. 
Second, we are considering whether, 
without posing a risk of program or 
patient abuse, we could expand the 
definition of a ‘‘qualified physician 
organization’’ to which protected 
payments can be made to include 
physician organizations comprised of 
some physicians who are not 
participating physicians. This approach, 
if implemented, would have the effect of 
protecting payments made directly to 
such physician organizations (rather 
than directly to individual physicians or 
‘‘passed through’’ the physician 
organization), provided that all other 
requirements of the exception were 
satisfied. We would adopt this approach 
only if we could do so in a manner that 
would not result in payments to 
physicians whose only contributions to 
the hospital’s incentive payment or 
shared savings program are potential 
referrals. If we expand the definition of 
a qualified physician organization, we 
envision a requirement that would 
permit only participating physicians to 
share in the incentive or shared savings 
payments. Our concerns described 
above about the difficulty hospitals 
would experience in monitoring the 
payments and the risk of manipulation 
to benefit referral source physicians or 
the physician organization as a whole 
are heightened with this approach. If we 
were to adopt this approach, we would 
include the proposed safeguards 
described above in connection with the 
pass-through payments proposal. In any 
event, we do not intend to protect 
arrangements that reward passive 
physicians who receive payments but 
do not participate in the achievement of 
the patient care quality or cost savings 
measure goals. 
One benefit of protecting programs 
that are structured so that payments are 
made from the hospital to a physician 
organization would be to avoid potential 
confusion that might be caused by the 
physician ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ 
provisions in § 411.354(c)(2) (under 
which a physician is considered to have 
the same compensation arrangements 
with the same parties and on the same 
terms as his or her physician 
organization with respect to whether 
remuneration is permissible under an 
exception). We are interested in 
comments on the relationship of the 
proposed exception to the ‘‘stand in the 
shoes’’ provisions. We are also 
interested in comments regarding 
whether the new exception, if adopted, 
should be included in § 411.357, or 
whether it would be preferable to 
include it in § 411.355 or elsewhere in 
the physician self-referral regulatory 
scheme. 
v. Requirements Related to the 
Arrangement Between a Hospital and 
the Participating Physician or Qualified 
Physician Organization 
We are proposing to include in the 
exception certain criteria that are 
common to most of the exceptions to the 
physician self-referral prohibition for 
compensation arrangements, namely, 
that the arrangement be set out in 
writing, signed by the parties, have a 
minimum term of 1 year and a 
maximum term of 3 years, and specify 
compensation that is set in advance, 
does not vary during the term of the 
arrangement, and is not determined in 
a manner that takes into account the 
volume or value of referrals or other 
business generated between the parties. 
We are proposing to require that the 
written agreement between the hospital 
offering the program and the physicians 
participating in the program document 
the performance measures against 
which the performance of the 
participating physicians will be 
measured. In addition, we are proposing 
that each performance measure 
(including, for example, specific cost 
savings measures) and the payments 
resulting from the achievement of 
established targets must be delineated 
separately and clearly. We believe 
transparency is crucial to ensure that 
the incentive payment or shared savings 
program does not pose a risk of program 
or patient abuse. However, we are 
interested in comments regarding 
whether and, if so, how total (or 
‘‘global’’) savings for a particular 
department or service line can be 
included in the program and sufficiently 
monitored, accounted for, and 
distributed so as not to pose a risk of 
program or patient abuse and to permit 
transparency of the program. 
As in all exceptions issued using our 
authority under section 1877(b)(4) of the 
Act, we are proposing to include a 
requirement that the arrangement does 
not violate the anti-kickback statute or 
any Federal or State law or regulation 
governing billing or claims submission. 
This is necessary to ensure that the 
arrangement does not pose a risk of 
program or patient abuse, the standard 
for all exceptions issued using this 
authority. 
In order to promote transparency and 
foster accountability, we are proposing 
to require that the arrangement between 
the parties require written disclosure to 
patients affected by the program 
regarding the nature of the program and 
the physician’s or qualified physician 
organization’s participation in the 
program prior to admission to the 
hospital, or, if pre-admission disclosure 
is not feasible, prior to the procedure or 
other treatment to which the program is 
applicable. Affected patients include 
those patients whose patient care at the 
hospital relates to any of the measures 
that are part of the program. For 
example, a patient being admitted to a 
hospital for cardiac surgery should 
receive a disclosure if the hospital 
operates an incentive payment or shared 
savings program related to cardiac 
surgery and his or her physician 
participates in that program. We are 
considering whether patients should be 
permitted to opt out of a measure that 
might otherwise apply to their care and 
are seeking comments regarding 
whether and how this would work in 
practice. 
Finally, we are proposing the 
following additional safeguards. We are 
interested in comments regarding how 
to incorporate these requirements into 
the regulation text. First, to guard 
against cherry picking or other abuse, 
the case severity, and the ages and 
payers of the patient population treated 
by the participating physician under the 
arrangement must be monitored using 
generally-accepted standards. The 
monitoring could be conducted by an 
independent outside party or by a 
committee composed of representatives 
of the hospital and participating 
physicians. If there are significant 
changes from the hospital’s historical 
measures, the physician at issue must be 
terminated from participation in the 
arrangement. The monitor should also 
assess these characteristics in the 
aggregate across all participating 
physicians; if there are significant 
changes, the program should be 
terminated. Second, physicians are only 
eligible for payments that are related to 
their own efforts, combined with the 
efforts of the other physicians in their

pool, at meeting cost savings measures 
or achieving patient care quality 
measures; that is, a physician is eligible 
to receive only a per capita share of that 
portion of an available incentive 
payment or shared savings payment 
attributable to the efforts of his or her 
pool. Third, all measures should be 
uniformly applied to all patients 
including Medicare beneficiaries (that 
is, the measures should not be applied 
disproportionately to Medicare 
beneficiaries). Procedures or treatments 
subject to the incentive payment or 
shared savings program should not be 
performed disproportionally on Federal 
health care program beneficiaries. We 
are also considering and interested in 
comments regarding a requirement that 
the hospital offering an incentive 
payment or shared savings program 
audit the calculation of cost savings and 
payments made under the program. To 
this end, we are interested in comments 
regarding the formality of such an audit; 
that is, should we permit the hospital to 
complete the audit internally, or should 
we require an independent financial 
audit of the books and records related to 
the incentive payment or shared savings 
program. 
We would also require that incentive 
payment and shared savings programs 
must not involve the counseling or 
promotion of a business arrangement or 
other activity that violates any Federal 
or State law. In addition, we are 
proposing that the full range of 
documentation developed and 
maintained in connection with 
compliance with the new exception be 
retained and made available to the 
Secretary upon request. 
O. Physician Quality Reporting Initiative 
(PQRI) 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘PQRI’’ at the beginning of your 
comments.] 
1. Program Background and Statutory 
Authority 
a. Division B of the Tax Relief and 
Health Care Act of 2006—Medicare 
Improvements and Extension Act of 
2006 (MIEA–TRHCA): Requirements for 
the PQRI Program 
Section 101(b) of the MIEA–TRHCA 
amended section 1848 of the Act by 
adding subsection (k). Section 
1848(k)(1) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to implement a system for the 
reporting by eligible professionals of 
data on quality measures as described in 
section 1848(k)(2) of the Act. Section 
101(b) authorizes the Secretary to 
specify the form and manner for data 
submission by program instruction or 
otherwise which may include 
submission of such data on Part B 
claims. Section 1848(k)(3)(B) of the Act 
specifies that for the purpose of the 
quality reporting system, eligible 
professionals include physicians, other 
practitioners as described in section 
1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act, physical and 
occupational therapists, and qualified 
speech-language pathologists. Section 
101(c) of the MIEA–TRHCA, as 
amended by the Medicare, Medicaid, 
and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (Pub. 
L. 110–173) (MMSEA), authorizes 
‘‘Transitional Bonus Incentive Payments 
for Quality Reporting’’ in 2007 and 
2008, for satisfactory reporting of 
quality data, as defined by section 
101(c)(2) of the MIEA–TRHCA. We have 
named this quality reporting system, the 
‘‘Physician Quality Reporting Initiative 
(PQRI)’’ for ease of reference. 
b. PQRI for 2007 
For 2007, the Secretary is authorized 
to pay an incentive payment equal to 1.5 
percent of the estimated total allowed 
charges for all covered professional 
services furnished during the reporting 
period. The reporting period for the 
PQRI for 2007 is defined by MIEA– 
TRHCA as the period beginning on July 
1, 2007, and ending on December 31, 
2007. For 2007, PQRI data submission 
was limited to claims-based submission 
based upon specifications and 
instructions posted on the CMS Web 
site for 74 PQRI measures. 
Preliminary PQRI participation 
information through November 2007 
indicates that approximately 100,000 
professionals, or about 16 percent, of 
eligible professionals who could have 
reported quality data on one or more of 
the 74 2007 PQRI quality measures 
submitted PQRI quality data at least 
once during the 2007 reporting period. 
This number includes professionals 
from all 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin 
Islands. In our regions with the highest 
participation, reporting rates are 
approaching 20 percent, with some 
States achieving reporting rates of 
around 30 percent. Nationally, there 
were above average rates of 
participation by eligible professionals 
furnishing services relevant to the 
following three types of care: anesthesia 
services; eye care; and emergency care. 
Participation rates have trended 
upwards during the 2007 reporting 
period. Based on expanded measures, 
new reporting options and other factors, 
we anticipate that trend will continue 
for 2008. Further details of the PQRI for 
2007 are provided on the PQRI section 
of the CMS Web site at: http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/ 
33_2007_General_Info.asp#TopOfPage. 
Incentive payments and access to 
confidential reports on measures 
reporting rates and measures 
performance rates for 2007 are 
scheduled to begin in mid-July 2008. 
c. PQRI for 2008 
Section 1848(k)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, as 
added by the MIEA–TRHCA, required 
the Secretary to publish a proposed set 
of quality measures for 2008 by August 
15, 2007 and provide for a period of 
public comment. Section 
1848(k)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, as added by 
the MIEA–TRHCA provides that for 
purposes of reporting data on quality 
measures for covered professional 
services furnished in 2008, such 
measures shall be measures that have 
been endorsed or adopted by a 
consensus organization, such as the 
National Quality Forum (NQF) or the 
AQA Alliance (AQA), that include 
measures that have been submitted by a 
physician specialty, and that the 
Secretary identifies as having used a 
consensus-based process for developing 
such measures. In addition, the 
measures shall include structural 
measures, such as the use of electronic 
health records (EHRs) and electronic 
prescribing technology. 
In the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38196 through 38199), we provided 
a detailed discussion of the MIEA– 
TRHCA requirements and the PQRI. We 
explained our interpretation of 
applicable statutory and government- 
wide policies relevant to defining a 
consensus-based measure development 
process, as well as our policy for 
determining which measures meet 
requirements for inclusion in PQRI for 
2008. 
To meet the MIEA–TRHCA 
requirement to publish proposed 2008 
PQRI measures by August 15, 2007, we 
published 148 proposed 2008 PQRI 
quality measures in the CY 2008 PFS 
proposed rule (72 FR 38199 through 
38202). We invited comments on the 
proposed measures and on our plans to 
explore mechanisms for submission of 
electronic clinical performance 
measurement information and summary 
measure results information extracted 
from EHRs and clinical data registries. 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66336 through 
66359), we responded to public 
comments received on the PQRI section 
of the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38196 through 38204) and we 
finalized 119 measures that we 
determined under the MIEA–TRHCA 
and other applicable statutory 
requirements to be appropriate for

eligible professionals to use to submit 
such data under the 2008 PQRI. In 
addition, we described our plans to test 
quality measures data submission 
mechanisms, other than claims, based 
on clinical data registries and EHRs in 
2008. 
The 2008 measures specifications are 
available on the PQRI section of the 
CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/ 
15_MeasuresCodes.asp#TopOfPage. 
These detailed specifications include 
instructions for reporting and identify 
the circumstances in which each 
measure is applicable. 
d. Extension of and Enhancements to 
the PQRI Program Authorized by the 
MMSEA 
The MMSEA, which was enacted on 
December 29, 2007, authorizes us to 
make incentive payments for 
satisfactorily reporting quality measures 
data on covered professional services 
furnished in 2008 equal to 1.5 percent 
of the estimated total allowed charges 
for all covered professional services 
furnished during the reporting period. 
For 2008, the reporting period is defined 
to mean the entire calendar year. In 
addition, while MIEA–TRHCA 
established a cap on incentive payments 
for the 2007 PQRI, based on an average 
per measure payment amount, there is 
no cap on incentive payments under 
MMSEA for the 2008 PQRI. 
MMSEA also introduced 
enhancements that result in more 
opportunities for eligible professionals 
to participate in the PQRI for 2008. For 
2008 and 2009, section 101(c)(5)(F) of 
the MIEA–TRHCA, as added by the 
MMSEA, requires the Secretary to 
establish alternative reporting periods 
and alternative criteria for satisfactorily 
submitting data on quality measures 
through medical registries and for 
reporting groups of measures. For 2008, 
these alternative reporting periods and 
reporting criteria were posted on April 
16, 2008 in ‘‘2008 PQRI: Establishment 
of Alternative Reporting Periods and 
Reporting Criteria’’ document found on 
the PQRI section of the CMS Web site 
at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/ 
Downloads/ 
2008PQRIalterrptperiods.pdf. They 
supplement the single reporting period 
and the reporting criteria previously set 
forth in the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66357 through 
66359) which were limited to claims- 
based submission of individual 2008 
PQRI measures. 
For 2008, each eligible professional 
who satisfactorily reports under any of 
the options set forth in the ‘‘2008 PQRI: 
Establishment of Alternative Reporting 
Periods and Reporting Criteria’’ 
document or for the reporting period 
and under the reporting criteria set forth 
in the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period will be eligible for a 1.5 
percent incentive payment for services 
furnished during the applicable 
reporting period. An eligible 
professional may potentially qualify as 
satisfactorily reporting under more than 
one of the reporting criteria and for 
more than one reporting period. 
However, this will result in only one 
incentive payment for 2008, which will 
be equivalent to 1.5 percent of allowed 
charges for PFS covered professional 
services furnished during the longest 
reporting period for which the eligible 
professional satisfactorily reports. 
e. PQRI for 2009 
Section 1848(k)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, as 
amended by the MMSEA, requires the 
Secretary to publish a proposed set of 
quality measures that would be 
appropriate for eligible professionals to 
use to submit data in 2009 in the 
Federal Register by August 15, 2008. 
Such measures shall be measures that 
have been endorsed or adopted by a 
consensus organization, such as the 
NQF or the AQA, that include measures 
that have been submitted by a physician 
specialty, and that the Secretary 
identifies as having used a consensus- 
based process for developing such 
measures. In addition, the measures 
shall include structural measures, such 
as the use of EHRs and electronic 
prescribing technology. 
The measures proposed for the 2009 
PQRI are outlined in section II.O.4. of 
this proposed rule, ‘‘Proposed 2009 
PQRI Quality Measures.’’ Section 
1848(k)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act, as amended 
by the MMSEA, requires the Secretary 
to publish the final set of measures in 
the Federal Register no later than 
November 15, 2008. The final set of 
2009 PQRI quality measures will be 
identified in the CY 2009 PFS final rule 
with comment period. 
The MIEA–TRHCA does not 
statutorily define a specific reporting 
period for 2009. However, as for 2008, 
the Secretary is required to establish 
alternative reporting periods and 
alternative reporting criteria for 
reporting measures groups and for 
registry-based reporting for 2009. For 
the 2009 PQRI, we propose to define the 
reporting period for PQRI to mean the 
entire 2009 calendar year but also 
propose additional reporting options for 
satisfactorily reporting quality measures 
data based on alternative reporting 
criteria and reporting periods 
authorized by MMSEA for measures 
groups and registry-based reporting, 
which are described in section II.O.2. of 
this proposed rule, ‘‘Satisfactory 
Reporting Criteria and Reporting 
Periods—Reporting Options in the 2009 
PQRI.’’ 
Unlike 2007 and 2008, MIEA–TRHCA 
does not authorize an incentive 
payment for PQRI for 2009. Currently, 
no legislation exists that authorizes us 
to make incentive payments for 
satisfactorily reporting data on quality 
measures for services furnished in 2009 
or beyond. Given that currently there is 
no specific authorization for an 
incentive payment for the 2009 PQRI, 
meeting the satisfactory reporting 
criteria of this proposed rule will not 
result in an incentive payment for 
satisfactorily reporting data for covered 
professional services furnished in 2009. 
2. Satisfactory Reporting Criteria and 
Reporting Periods—Reporting Options 
in the 2009 PQRI 
For the 2009 PQRI, we propose to 
define the reporting period to mean the 
entire year (January 1, 2009—December 
31, 2009.) We also propose to establish 
two alternative reporting periods: (1) 
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 
2009; and (2) July 1, 2009 through 
December 31, 2009 for reporting 
measures groups and for registry-based 
reporting. As proposed, this results in 
several reporting options available to 
eligible professionals that vary by the 
reporting mechanism selected. We 
believe that the availability of several 
reporting options will increase 
opportunities for eligible professionals 
to satisfactorily report quality data for 
the PQRI and will augment the amount 
of information submitted about the 
quality of care provided by eligible 
professionals to Medicare beneficiaries. 
The reporting mechanisms and 
reporting options proposed for the 2009 
PQRI are described in the following 
section. 
a. Claims-Based Submission of Data for 
Reporting Individual Measures 
Under Section 101(c)(2) of the MIEA– 
TRHCA the criteria for satisfactorily 
submitting data on quality measures 
require the reporting of at least three 
applicable measures in at least 80 
percent of the cases in which the 
measure is reportable. If fewer than 
three measures are applicable to the 
services of the professional, only data 
on applicable measures are required to 
be submitted. 
For the 2009 PQRI, we propose to 
retain these criteria for claims-based 
reporting of individual measures for the 
January 1, 2009—December 31, 2009 
reporting period. As summarized in 
Table 7, an eligible professional could

meet the criteria for satisfactorily 
reporting quality data by reporting at 
least three applicable measures (or one 
to two measures if fewer than three 
measures apply) for at least 80 percent 
of the cases in which each measure is 
reportable, during January 1, 2009 
through December 31, 2009.

January 1, 2009–December 31, 2009 
b. Satisfactory Reporting of Data on 
Quality Measures and Reporting Periods 
for Measures Groups, Through Claims- 
Based Reporting and Registry-Based 
Reporting 
Section 101(c)(5)(F) of the MIEA– 
TRHCA, as added by the MMSEA, 
requires that for the 2008 and 2009 
PQRI the Secretary establish alternative 
reporting periods and alternative criteria 
for satisfactorily reporting groups of 
measures. In establishing these 
alternatives, CMS has labeled these 
groups of measures ‘‘measures groups.’’ 
We define ‘‘measures groups’’ as a 
subset of PQRI measures that have a 
particular clinical condition or focus in 
common. The denominator definition 
and coding of the measures group 
identifies the condition or focus that is 
shared across the measures within a 
particular measures group. 
We believe that reporting measures 
groups is an important step to advance 
the PQRI program toward a more 
holistic and comprehensive assessment 
of patient care. By addressing several 
aspects of care for a particular clinical 
condition or clinical focus, measures 
groups results can help assure that 
patients are receiving a range of care 
appropriate for a given clinical 
condition or clinical focus. Because of 
this, we believe that groups of measures 
may often provide more meaningful 
information about the care being 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries than 
can individual measures in isolation. 
Measures groups also allow physicians 
and other eligible professionals to more 
broadly demonstrate their clinical 
performance for particular services and 
thereby provide a better basis for 
comparison among professionals. 
Measures groups can also decrease 
complexity of reporting by identifying 
related measures applicable to the same 
services furnished to the same 
beneficiaries by the same professional 
and highlighting a common set of 
denominator codes across all the 
measures of a group that help identify 
those patients. 
As described in the ‘‘2008 PQRI: 
Establishment of Alternative Reporting 
Periods and Reporting Criteria’’ 
document (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PQRI/Downloads/ 
2008PQRIalterrptperiods.pdf ), there are 
four measures groups for the 2008 PQRI: 
(1) Diabetes Mellitus, (2) End-Stage 
Renal Disease (ESRD), (3) Chronic 
Kidney Disease (CKD), and (4) 
Preventive Care. For the 2009 PQRI, we 
propose to expand the available 
measures groups to a total of nine, as 
well as propose a variety of reporting 
options for reporting on measures 
groups. In addition to carrying forward 
three of the four 2008 measures groups, 
we propose to add six new measures 
groups for the 2009 PQRI. The ESRD 
Measures Group for the 2008 PQRI is 
not being proposed for 2009 because 
one of the measures in the group is no 
longer NQF-endorsed and there are no 
other ESRD measures proposed for the 
2009 PQRI that could be added to this 
group. We propose to retain the 
remaining three measures in the 2008 
ESRD measures group to be available to 
be reported individually in the 2009 
PQRI. 
Similar to the 2008 measures groups, 
we propose that the measures that make 
up five of these new measures groups 
could be reported either individually or 
as part of a measures group. These five 
new measures groups address the 
following: 
(1) Coronary artery bypass graft 
(CABG) surgery; 
(2) Coronary artery disease (CAD); 
(3) Rheumatoid arthritis; 
(4) Human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS); and 
(5) Perioperative care. 
We also propose one new measures 
group for the 2009 PQRI in which the 
measures would be reportable only as a 
measures group, not as individual 
measures. This measures group 
addresses quality of services furnished 
to treat back pain. The measures 
proposed for inclusion in each of the 
proposed 2009 measures groups are 
listed in section II.O.4. of this proposed 
rule, ‘‘Proposed 2009 PQRI Quality 
Measures.’’ 
We welcome comments on these 
proposed new measures groups, 
including suggestions for other 
measures groups based on individual 
measures included in the proposed 2009 
PQRI measure set. For the 2009 PQRI, 
measures groups must contain at least 4 
measures. All measures in each 
measures group suggested by 
commenters must be included in the 
proposed measures cited in section 
II.O.4. of this proposed rule, ‘‘Proposed 
2009 PQRI Quality Measures.’’ The 
individual measures included in the 
final measures groups for the 2009 PQRI 
will be limited to those which are 
included in the final set of measures for 
PQRI 2009, as identified in the CY 2009 
PFS final rule with comment period. 
As in the 2008 PQRI, we are 
proposing for the 2009 PQRI that 
measures groups be reported through 
claims-based or registry-based 
submission for the 2009 PQRI. The form 
and manner of quality data submission 
for 2009 measures groups will be posted 
on the PQRI section of the CMS Web 
site at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri no 
later than December 31, 2008, and will 
detail specifications and specific 
instructions for reporting measures 
groups via claims and registry-based 
reporting. Please note that detailed 
measure specifications and instructions 
for submitting data on those 2009 
measures groups that were also 
included as 2008 PQRI measures groups 
may be updated or modified prior to 
2009. Therefore, the 2009 PQRI measure 
specifications for any given measures 
group may be different from 
specifications and submission 
instructions for the same measures 
group used for 2008. Additionally, the 
specifications for measures groups will 
not necessarily contain all the 
specification elements of each 
individual measure making up the 
measures group. This is based on the 
need for a common set of denominator 
specifications for all the measures

making up a measures group in order to 
define the applicability of the measures 
group. Therefore, the specifications and 
instructions for measures groups will be 
provided separately from the 
specifications and instructions for the 
individual 2009 PQRI measures. 
For the 2009 PQRI, we are proposing 
three options for satisfactorily reporting 
measures groups using claims-based 
reporting and three options for 
satisfactorily reporting measures groups 
using registry-based submission. The 
proposed options for satisfactorily 
reporting on measures groups are 
described in Table 8. The details of the 
requirements for registries are contained 
in section II.O.2.c., ‘‘Registry-Based 
Submission for Reporting Individual 
Measures.’’ 
TABLE 8.—PROPOSED 2009 PQRI REPORTING OPTIONS FOR MEASURES GROUPS 
Reporting mechanism Reporting criteria Reporting period 
Claims-based reporting .............................. One Measures Group for 30 Consecutive Medicare 
Part B FFS Patients.

Registry-based reporting ............................ One Measures Group for 30 Consecutive Patients. Pa-
tients may include, but may not be exclusively, non- 
Medicare patients.
January 1, 2009–December 31, 2009. 
Registry-based reporting ............................ One Measures Group for 80% of applicable Medicare 
Part B FFS patients of each eligible professional 
(with a minimum of 30 patients during the reporting

January 1, 2009–December 31, 2009. 
Registry-based reporting ............................ One Measures Group for 80% of applicable Medicare 
Part B FFS patients of each eligible professional 
(with a minimum of 15 patients during the reporting 
period).
July 1, 2009–December 31, 2009. 
There are two basic criteria for 
satisfactory reporting of measures 
groups. For claims-based reporting, the 
two criteria are: (1) The reporting of 
quality data for 30 consecutive Medicare 
Part B FFS patients for one measures 
group for which the measures group is 
applicable during a full-year reporting 
period; or (2) the reporting of quality 
data for at least 80 percent of Medicare 
Part B FFS patients for whom the 
measures group is applicable (with a 
minimum number of patients 
commensurate with the reporting period 
duration). For registry-based 
submission, the two criteria are: (1) The 
reporting of quality measures results 
and numerator and denominator data 
for 30 consecutive patients for one 
measures group for which the measures 
group is applicable during a full-year 
reporting period; or (2) the reporting of 
quality measures results and numerator 
and denominator data for at least 80 
percent of patients for whom the 
measures group is applicable (with a 
minimum number of patients 
commensurate with the reporting period 
duration). 
The 30 consecutive patients reporting 
criteria apply only to the entire year 
(January 1, 2009 through December 31, 
2009) reporting period, but apply to 
both claims-based submission and 
registry-based submission mechanisms. 
While claims are submitted to CMS on 
Medicare patients only (for claims-based 
reporting), consecutive patients for 
registry-based submission for the 
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 
2009 reporting period may include 
some, but may not be exclusively, non- 
Medicare patients. We include this 
limited option to report quality 
measures results and numerator and 
denominator data on quality measures 
that includes non-Medicare patients for 
registry-based submission because of the 
desirability of assessing the overall care 
provided by a professional rather than 
just that provided to a certain subset of 
patients, and the benefit of having a 
larger number of patients on which to 
assess quality. 
We propose that the alternative 
criteria for measures groups based on 
reporting on 80 percent of patients for 
which one measures group be 
applicable for the January 1, 2009 
through December 31, 2009 reporting 
period (with a minimum of 30 patients) 
and to the July 1, 2009 through 
December 31, 2009 reporting periods 
(with a minimum of 15 patients) and for 
either claims-based or registry-based 
reporting of measures groups. 
We have included the reporting 
option for 30 consecutive patients (for 
claims-based reporting, the consecutive 
patients must all be Medicare FFS 
patients) as a means to achieve a 
reasonably valid sample of patients for 
performance rate calculation yet place 
an upper limit on the number of 
patients on which reporting would be 
required, compared to the 80 percent of 
patients criteria. However, unlike 2008, 
we do not propose an option for 15 
consecutive patients for the 6-month 
reporting period. While we do not have 
the results of the 2008 reporting, we are 
concerned that samples of fewer than 30 
consecutive patients may be insufficient 
to calculate comparable performance 
rates across eligible professionals 
furnishing comparable services. We 
expect additional experience with PQRI 
reporting to clarify optimal sample sizes 
and reporting criteria for use in future 
reporting periods. We invite comments 
on our proposed use of the consecutive 
patient reporting criteria and on the use 
of 30 consecutive patients (for claims- 
based reporting, the consecutive 
patients must all be Medicare FFS 
patients) as the required sample under 
these criteria during the full-year 2009 
reporting period.

Reporting Individual Measures 
Under section 1848(k)(4) of the Act,

mechanism whereby an eligible 
professional may provide data on 
quality measures through an appropriate 
medical registry.’’ In the CY 2008 PFS 
final rule with comment period, we 
described using different options to test 
the receipt of data from registries in 
2008 (72 FR 66350 through 66352). The 
two options being tested in 2008 are 
data submission options 2 and 3 as 
described in the CY 2008 PFS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66352). 
This testing process is ongoing, but 
submissions for the testing process are 
expected to conclude by September 1, 
2008. Information regarding the registry 
submission testing process is available 
on the CMS Web site at http://www/ 
cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/ 
20_Reporting.asp#TopOfPage. 
As we indicated previously, section 
101(c)(5)(F) of the MIEA–TRHCA, as 
added by MMSEA, authorizes us to 
establish alternative criteria for 
satisfactorily reporting PQRI quality 
data through medical registries for 2008 
and 2009. For 2008, we have established 
the requirements a registry must meet to 
qualify to submit data on quality 
measures on behalf of eligible 
professionals seeking incentive 
payments in 2008. The data to be 
submitted includes the reporting and 
performance rates on PQRI measures or 
PQRI measures groups; and, numerators 
and denominators for the reporting rates 
and performance rates. The 
requirements that we established for 
2008 include a registry self-nomination 
process. The document ‘‘2008 PQRI 
Registry Requirements for Submission 
Under New Options’’ describes the 
requirements for a registry to qualify to 
submit under the registry-based 
reporting alternatives for 2008. This 
document is available on the PQRI 
section of the CMS Web site at http:// 
www/cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/ 
20_Reporting.asp#TopOfPage. On or 
before August 31, 2008, we will 
announce the names of self-nominated 
registries that are determined by CMS to 
meet necessary technical and other 
requirements to submit quality 
measures results and numerator and 
denominator data on quality measures 
on behalf of eligible professionals 
seeking an incentive under the 
alternative reporting periods and criteria 
applicable to registry-based submission 
for reporting quality measures on 
services furnished during 2008. 
For 2009, we propose that eligible 
professionals would be able to report 
2009 PQRI quality measures data 
through a qualified clinical registry by 
authorizing or instructing the registry to 
submit quality measures results and 
numerator and denominator data on 
quality measures to CMS on their 
behalf. As for 2008, the data to be 
submitted for 2009 includes the 
reporting and performance rates on 
PQRI measures or PQRI measures 
groups; and, numerators and 
denominators for the reporting rates and 
performance rates. To do so, eligible 
professionals would need to enter into 
and maintain an appropriate legal 
arrangement with an eligible clinical 
registry. Such arrangements would 
provide for the registry’s receipt of 
patient-specific data from the eligible 
professional and the registry’s 
disclosure of quality measures results 
and numerator and denominator data on 
behalf of the eligible professional to 
CMS for the PQRI. Thus, the registry 
would act as a HIPAA Business 
Associate and agent of the eligible 
professional. Such agents are referred to 
as ‘‘data submission vendors.’’ Such 
‘‘data submission vendors’’ would have 
the requisite legal authority to provide 
clinical registry data on behalf of the 
eligible professional to the Quality 
Reporting System developed in 
accordance with the statute. The 
registry, acting as such a data 
submission vendor, would submit 
registry-derived measures information 
to the CMS designated database within 
the Quality Reporting System, using a 
CMS-specified record layout. The record 
layout will be posted on the PQRI 
section of the CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri as soon as 
practical, and no later than April 1, 
2009. 
To maintain compliance with 
applicable statutes and regulations, 
including but not limited to the Health 
Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 
104–191) (HIPAA), our program and its 
data system must maintain compliance 
with HIPAA requirements for 
requesting, processing, storing, and 
transmitting data. Eligible professionals 
that conduct HIPAA covered 
transactions also must maintain 
compliance with the HIPAA 
requirements. 
For the 2009 PQRI, we propose to 
continue the PQRI reporting criteria for 
satisfactorily reporting through registry- 
based submission of 3 or more 
individual PQRI quality measures data 
that are described in the ‘‘2008 PQRI: 
Establishment of Alternative Reporting 
Periods and Reporting Criteria’’ 
document (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PQRI/Downloads/ 
2008PQRIalterrptperiods.pdf). That is, 
we propose to accept quality measures 
results and numerator and denominator 
data on quality measures from registries 
that qualify as data submission vendors. 
We propose these criteria would be 
available for each of the two alternative 
reporting periods. Thus, the proposed 
reporting options for registry-based 
submission of at least three individual 
PQRI measures are listed in Table 9. 
TABLE 9.—PROPOSED 2009 PQRI REGISTRY-BASED SUBMISSION REPORTING OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES 
Reporting mechanism Reporting criteria Reporting period 
Registry-based reporting ............................ At least 3 PQRI measures for 80% of applicable Medi-
care Part B FFS patients of each eligible professional.
January 1, 2009–December 31, 2009. 
Registry-based reporting ............................ At least 3 PQRI measures for 80% of applicable Medi-
care Part B FFS patients of each eligible professional.
July 1, 2009–December 31, 2009. 
As discussed in section II.O.2.b. of 
this proposed rule, ‘‘Satisfactory 
Reporting of Data on Quality Measures 
and Reporting Periods for Measures 
Groups, Through Claims-Based 
Reporting and Registry-Based 
Reporting,’’ we also propose the three 
reporting options for registry-based 
submission of quality measures results 
and numerator and denominator data on 
PQRI measures groups summarized in 
Table 8. 
To submit on behalf of eligible 
professionals pursuing incentive 
payment for reporting clinical quality 
information on services furnished 
during 2008 for reporting both on 
individual measures and measures 
groups, we required registries to 
complete a self-nomination process and 
to meet certain technical and other 
requirements in order to be considered 
‘‘qualified’’ to submit on behalf of 
eligible professionals pursuing the 2008 
PQRI incentive payment. These 2008 
requirements are detailed in section (g) 
of the document titled: ‘‘2008 Physician

Periods and Reporting Criteria,’’ which 
is posted at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
PQRI/Downloads/ 
2008PQRIalterrptperiods.pdf, and in a 
further document titled ‘‘Registry 
Requirements to Qualify as an 
Acceptable Registry for Submission of 
PQRI Data On Behalf of Eligible 
Professionals Seeking Payment in 
2008,’’ which is posted at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/Downloads/ 
2008PQRIRegistryRequirements.pdf). 
For 2009, we propose to again require 
a self-nomination process based on 
meeting specific technical and other 
requirements in order to qualify to 
submit data on 2009 PQRI quality 
measures or measures groups on behalf 
of eligible professionals for services 
furnished in 2009. This self-nomination 
will be required regardless of whether or 
not the registry participated in any way 
in PQRI in 2008. As in 2008, we will 
make every effort to ensure that 
registries that are ‘‘qualified’’ will be 
able to successfully submit quality 
measures results and numerator and 
denominator data on PQRI quality 
measures or measures groups on behalf 
of their professionals. By listing a 
registry as ‘‘qualified,’’ however, we 
cannot guarantee or assume 
responsibility for the successful 
submission of data on PQRI quality 
measures or measures groups. We 
propose that the 2009 registry technical 
requirements will be substantially the 
same as for 2008. In general, to be 
considered qualified to submit 
individual quality measures on behalf of 
professionals wishing to report under 
the 2009 PQRI, a registry must: 
• Have been in existence as of 
January 1, 2009. 
• Be able to collect all needed data 
elements and calculate results for at 
least three measures in the 2009 PQRI 
program (according to the posted 2009 
PQRI Measure Specifications). 
• Be able to calculate and submit 
measure-level reporting rates by 
National Provider Identifier (NPI)/ 
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). 
• Be able to calculate and submit 
measure-level performance rates by NPI/ 
TIN. 
• Be able to separate out and report 
on Medicare Fee For Service (Part B) 
patients only. 
• Provide the Registry name. 
• Provide the Reporting period start 
date (covers dates of services from). 
• Provide the Reporting period end 
date (covers dates of services through). 
• Provide the PQRI Measure 
Numbers. 
• Provide the measure titles. 
• Report the number of eligible 
instances (reporting denominator). 
• Report the number of instances of 
quality service performed (numerator). 
• Report the number of performance 
exclusions. 
• Report the number of reported 
instances, performance not met (eligible 
professional receives credit for 
reporting, not for performance). 
• Be able to transmit this data in a 
CMS-approved XML format. 
• Comply with a secure method for 
data submission. 
• Submit a ‘‘validation strategy’’ to 
CMS by May 31, 2009. A validation 
strategy ascertains whether eligible 
professionals have submitted accurately 
and on at least the minimum number 
(80 percent) of their eligible patients, 
visits, procedures, or episodes for a 
given measure. Acceptable validation 
strategies often include such provisions 
as the registry being able to conduct 
random sampling of their participants’ 
data, but may also be based on other 
credible means verifying the accuracy of 
data content and completeness of 
reporting or adherence to a required 
sampling method. 
• Be able to include in its overall 
submission whether the results for each 
NPI are validated by the registry. 
• Enter into and maintain with its 
participating professionals an 
appropriate legal arrangement that 
provides for the registry’s receipt of 
patient-specific data from the eligible 
professionals, as well as the registry’s 
disclosure of quality measure results 
and numerator and denominator data on 
behalf of eligible professionals who 
wish to participate in the PQRI program. 
• Obtain and keep on file signed 
documentation that each NPI whose 
data is submitted to the registry has 
authorized the registry to submit quality 
measures results and numerator and 
denominator data to CMS for the 
purpose of PQRI participation. This 
documentation must meet the standards 
of applicable law, regulations, and 
contractual business associate 
agreements. 
• Provide CMS access (if requested) 
to review the Medicare beneficiary data 
on which 2009 PQRI registry-based 
submissions are founded. 
• Provide the reporting option 
(reporting period and reporting criteria) 
that the eligible professional has 
satisfied or chosen. 
• Registries must provide CMS an 
‘‘attestation statement’’ which states that 
the quality measure results and 
numerator and denominator data 
provided to CMS are accurate and 
complete. 
In addition to the above, registries 
that wish to submit 2009 quality 
measures information on behalf of their 
participating eligible professionals 
seeking to participate in the 2009 PQRI 
based on satisfying the criteria 
applicable to reporting of measures 
groups must be able to: 
• Indicate whether each eligible 
professional within the registry who 
wishes to submit PQRI using the 
measure groups will be doing so for the 
6- or 12-month period. 
• Include only patients who were 
cared for during the twelve-month 
measurement period (reporting period) 
of January through December 2009 or 
the 6-month measurement period 
(reporting period) of July 2009 through 
December 2009. 
• Agree that the registry’s data may be 
inspected by CMS under our health 
oversight authority if non-Medicare 
patients are included in the consecutive 
patient group. 
• Be able to report data on all of the 
measures in a given measures group and 
on either 30 consecutive patients from 
January 1 through December 31, 2009 
(note this consecutive patient count 
must include some Medicare 
beneficiaries) or on 80 percent of 
applicable Medicare Part B FFS patients 
for each eligible professional (with a 
minimum of 30 patients during the 
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 
2009 reporting period or a minimum of 
15 patients during the July 1, 2009 
through December 31, 2009 reporting 
period). 
• If reporting consecutive patients, 
provide the beginning date of service 
that initiates the count of 30 consecutive 
patients. 
• Be able to report the number of 
Medicare Fee for Service patients and 
the number of Medicare Advantage 
patients that are included in the 
consecutive patients reported for a given 
measures group. 
However, for 2009, we may modify 
certain aspects of the registry technical 
requirements listed above, which are 
based on the 2008 registry requirements 
that are described in the ‘‘Registry 
Requirements to Qualify as an 
Acceptable Registry for Submission of 
PQRI Data On Behalf of Eligible 
Professionals Seeking Payment in 2008’’ 
document available on the CMS Web 
site at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/

2008 registry testing process and any 
comments received on the 2009 registry 
technical requirements proposed above.

exact date by which registries that wish 
to qualify for 2009 must submit a self- 
nomination letter, on the PQRI section 
of the CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri by November 15, 
2008. We anticipate that registries that 
wish to self-nominate for 2009 will be 
required to do so by the end of the first 
quarter of 2009, but not later than the 
end of the second quarter of 2009. 
We invite comments on the proposed 
options for registry-based PQRI 
reporting of data on measures and 
measures groups for services furnished 
in 2009. 
d. EHR-Based Submission for Reporting 
Individual Measures 
In addition to the testing of registry- 
based submission, we are currently 
preparing for testing the submission of 
clinical quality data extracted from 
EHRs for five 2008 PQRI measures. We 
anticipate this testing will begin July 1, 
2008 and conclude by December 31, 
2008. For the 2009 PQRI, we propose to 
accept PQRI data from EHRs for a 
limited subset of the proposed 2009 
PQRI quality measures identified in 
Tables 11 and 13 (section II.O.4., 
‘‘Proposed 2009 PQRI Quality 
Measures’’), contingent upon the 
successful completion of our 2008 EHR 
data submission testing process and a 
determination that accepting data from 
EHRs on quality measures for the 2009 
PQRI is practical and feasible. Provided 
our 2008 EHR data submission testing 
process is successful, we propose to 
begin accepting submission of clinical 
quality data extracted from EHRs on 
January 1, 2009 or as soon thereafter as 
is technically feasible. The date on 
which we would begin to accept quality 
data submission on services furnished 
in 2009 is contingent upon when we can 
have the necessary information 
technology infrastructure components 
and capacity in place and ready to 
accept data on a scale sufficient for 
national implementation of PQRI 
submission through this mechanism. 
(Because EHR-based data submission 
need not be accomplished concurrently 
with the dates services are furnished or 
billed, there is some latitude to begin 
accepting EHR-extracted data later than 
January 1, 2009, without precluding 
accepting data for the proposed 2009 
PQRI reporting periods.) 
The electronic specifications for the 
proposed 2009 PQRI measures 
identified in Tables 11 and 13 that are 
under consideration for EHR-based 
submission in 2009 will be posted on a 
public Web site when available. We will 
broadly announce the availability and 
exact location of these specifications 
through familiar CMS communications 
channels including the PQRI section of 
the CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri. The posting of 
the electronic specifications for any 
particular measure prior to publication 
of the final rule does not signify that the 
measure will be necessarily selected for 
the 2009 PQRI measure set, nor that 
EHR-based data submission will be 
accepted for that measure even if it may 
otherwise be included in the 2009 PQRI. 
However, by posting the specifications, 
we seek to allow sufficient time for EHR 
vendors to adapt their products to 
support EHR-based capture and 
submission of data for these measures 
prior to the start of any 2009 PQRI 
reporting periods. 
EHR vendors that would like to 
enable their customers to submit data on 
PQRI that is extracted from their 
customers’ EHRs to the CMS-designated 
clinical warehouse should update or 
otherwise assure that their EHR 
products capture and can submit the 
necessary data elements identified for 
measure specifications and technical 
specifications for EHR-based 
submission. We will use Certification 
Commission for Healthcare Information 
Technology (CCHIT) criteria and 
Secretarially-recognized Healthcare 
Information Technology Standards 
Panel (HITSP) interoperability standards 
where possible and we encourage 
vendors to do so also. These are the 
specifications that will be available on 
a publicly accessible Web site to be 
identified by CMS. 
Prior to the beginning of EHR-based 
quality measures data submission for 
any 2009 PQRI reporting period, we will 
publish (through familiar mechanisms 
such as CMS e-mail lists and the PQRI 
section of the CMS Web site at http:// 
www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri) information on 
the process eligible professionals will 
need to use to actually submit to the 
CMS-designated clinical data warehouse 
the 2009 PQRI quality measures data 
extracted from their practices’ EHRs. 
The process will comply with 
applicable laws, regulations, and 
policies for privacy, data security, and 
interoperability—including but not 
limited to HIPAA requirements. The 
data submission process will also 
require that the persons (eligible 
professionals, other practice staff, or 
vendors acting on the professionals’ 
behalf) who actually exchange data with 
the clinical warehouse system obtain 
and use an account (user identification 
and password) on a CMS-designated 
user authentication and identity 
management system. We will not charge 
2008 or 2009 PQRI participants any 
processing or licensing fees to obtain or 
maintain the required user account. 
More details on the required account 
and how to obtain it will be published 
prior to January 1, 2009. 
We cannot assume responsibility for 
the successful submission of data from 
eligible professionals’ EHRs. Any 
eligible professional wishing to submit 
PQRI data extracted from an EHR 
should contact the EHR product’s 
vendor to determine if the product has 
been updated to facilitate PQRI quality 
measures data submission. Such 
professionals should also begin 
attempting submission promptly after 
CMS announces in early 2009 that the 
clinical data warehouse is ready to 
accept 2009 PQRI quality measures data 
through the EHR mechanism in order to 
assure the professional has a reasonable 
period of time to work with his or her 
EHR and/or its vendor to correct any 
problems that may complicate or 
preclude successful quality measures 
data submission through that EHR. 
To maintain compliance with 
applicable statutes and regulations, 
including but not limited to HIPAA, our 
program and its data system must 
comply with applicable requirements 
for requesting, processing, storing, and 
transmitting data. Eligible professionals 
that conduct HIPAA covered 
transactions also must maintain 
compliance with the HIPAA 
requirements. 
We encourage the use of EHRs that 
have been certified by the CCHIT for 
data submission. CCHIT certified EHRs 
must meet specific standards for 
functionality, privacy, security and 
interoperability. More information about 
CCHIT certified EHRs can be found at 
http://www.cchit.org. However, we do 
recognize that there will be some 
eligible professionals who are using 
systems in specialties for which there 
are no appropriate CCHIT certified EHR 
systems, or who purchased and 
implemented their EHR prior to the 
availability of CCHIT certification. 
These programs must be capable of 
generating a medication list, generating 
a problem list and entering laboratory 
results as discrete searchable data 
elements to be able to be used for data 
submission under this reporting 
mechanism option. 
We propose to utilize as criteria for 
satisfactory submission of data for 
quality measures for covered 
professional services by EHR-based 
submission for the 2009 PQRI the same 
criteria for successful reporting and the 
same reporting period that we propose 
for claims-based submission of data for 
individual 2009 PQRI measures. The 
reporting criteria for EHR-based 
submission of individual PQRI 
measures are summarized in Table 10.

TABLE 10.—PROPOSED 2009 PQRI EHR-BASED SUBMISSION REPORTING OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL MEASURES 
Reporting mechanism Reporting criteria Reporting period 
EHR-based reporting .................................. At least 3 PQRI measures, or 1–2 measures if less 
than 3 apply to the eligible professional, for 80% of 
applicable Medicare Part B FFS patients of each eli-
gible professional.
January 1, 2009–December 31, 2009. 
We do not propose any option to 
report measures groups through EHR- 
based data submission on services 
furnished during 2009. Because EHR 
submission to CMS of data on quality 
measures is new to PQRI, for 2009 we 
propose to make available only the 
criteria applicable to reporting of 
individual PQRI measures. We invite 
comments on the proposed use of EHR- 
based data submission for PQRI. 
3. Statutory Requirements for Measures 
Included in the 2009 PQRI 
a. Overview of Requirements for the 
2009 PQRI Quality Measures 
Section 1848(k)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act, as 
added by the MMSEA, requires CMS to 
publish in the Federal Register no later 
than August 15, 2008, a proposed set of 
quality measures that would be 
appropriate for eligible professionals to 
use to submit data in 2009. In 
examining the statutory requirements of 
section 1848(k)(2)(B)(i) of the Act, as 
amended by the MMSEA, we believe 
that the requirement that measures be 
endorsed or adopted by a consensus 
organization applies to each measure 
that would be included in the measure 
set for submitting quality data and/or 
quality measures results and numerator 
and denominator data on the quality 
measures on covered professional 
services furnished during 2009. 
Likewise, the requirement for measures 
to have been developed using a 
consensus-based process (as identified 
by the Secretary) applies to each 
measure. By contrast, we do not 
interpret the provision requiring 
inclusion of measures submitted by a 
specialty to apply to each measure. 
Rather, we believe this requirement 
means that in endorsing or adopting 
measures, a consensus organization 
must include in its consideration 
process at least some measures 
submitted by one physician or 
organization representing a particular 
specialty. 
We also believe that under sections 
1848(k)(2)(B)(ii) through (iii) of the Act, 
as amended by the MMSEA, the 
Secretary is given broad discretion to 
determine which quality measures meet 
the statutory requirements and are 
appropriate for inclusion in the final set 
of measures for 2009. We do not 
interpret sections 1848(k)(2)(B) of the 
Act to require that all measures that 
meet the basic requirements of section 
1848(k)(2)(B)(i) of the Act must be 
included in the 2009 set of quality 
measures. 
We discuss in the following section 
the statutory requirements for consensus 
organizations and the use of a 
consensus-based process for developing 
quality measures as they relate to the 
requirements for the set of measures for 
2009 in the context of other applicable 
Federal law and policy. More 
information on the measure 
development process in general is 
available on the CMS Web site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
QualityInitiativesGenInfo. The next 
section also discusses the policies used 
in proposing the initial set of quality 
measures for eligible professionals for 
use in 2009 and the policies we are 
proposing to apply in publishing the 
final set. 
b. Consensus Organizations and 
Consensus-Based Process for 
Developing Measures 
Consistent with the principle that 
measures used for 2009 be endorsed or 
adopted by a consensus organization 
and developed through the use of a 
consensus-based process, but without 
proposing that 2009 PQRI measures be 
limited to those meeting the definition 
of a voluntary consensus standard under 
the National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104– 
113) (NTTAA), we interpret ‘‘consensus- 
based process for developing measures’’ 
as used in section 1848(k) of the Act and 
amended by MMSEA to encompass not 
only the basic development work of the 
formal measure developer, but also to 
include the achievement of consensus 
among stakeholders in the health care 
system. Consensus should be achieved 
based on at least a level of openness, 
balance of interest, and consensus 
reflected in the structures and processes 
of the NQF and AQA as of the date of 
enactment of MIEA–TRHCA, MMSEA, 
and the date of this proposed rule. More 
information on the structures and 
processes of the NQF and AQA can be 
found on the organizations’ respective 
Web sites at http:// 
www.qualityforum.org and http:// 
www.ambulatoryqualityalliance.org. 
Based on the considerations discussed 
in the CY 2008 PFS proposed rule (72 
FR 38196 through 38204), we are 
proposing to apply the following 
policies in identifying measures that 
meet the requirements for having used 
a consensus-based process for 
development and the requirement for 
having been endorsed or adopted by a 
consensus organization such as the NQF 
or AQA, and that are appropriate for 
inclusion as 2009 measures: 
(1) We continue to interpret ‘‘a 
consensus-based development process’’ 
as meaning that in addition to the 
measure development, the measure has 
achieved adoption or endorsement by a 
consensus organization having at least 
the basic characteristics of the AQA as 
a consensus organization as of 
December 2006, when the MIEA– 
TRHCA incorporating reference to AQA 
was passed and signed into law. Those 
basic characteristics include a 
comparable level of openness, balance 
of interest, and consensus-based on 
voting participation. As discussed above 
in this section and further clarified in 
points (3) and (5), we do not interpret 
‘‘consensus-based development 
process’’ per section 1848(k)(2)(B) of the 
Act to require that the consensus 
organization or process meet all of the 
criteria of the NTTAA and Office of 
Management and Budget Circular No. 
A–119 (OMB A–119) definition of a 
voluntary consensus standards body. 
(2) ‘‘Voluntary consensus standard’’ is 
interpreted to mean a voluntary 
consensus standard that has been 
endorsed as such by a consensus 
organization that meets the 
requirements of the NTTAA, as 
implemented by OMB A–119, for a 
voluntary consensus standards body. 
(3) Where there are available quality 
measures, and some of these measures 
meet the definition of ‘‘voluntary 
consensus standards’’ while others do 
not, those measures that meet the 
definition of ‘‘voluntary consensus 
standards’’ are preferred to other 
measures not meeting the requirements 
of the NTTAA. 
(4) In view of the preference for 
voluntary consensus standards, if a 
measure has been specifically

38566 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
considered by NQF for possible 
endorsement, but NQF has declined to 
endorse it as of August 31, 2008, we are 
proposing not to include it in the final 
set of 2009 PQRI Quality Measures. 
(5) Although the AQA, as organized in 
December 2006, does not meet the 
requirements of the NTTAA for a 
voluntary consensus standards body, it 
is a consensus organization per section 
1848(k)(2)(B) of the Act. In 
circumstances where no voluntary 
consensus standard (NQF-endorsed) 
measure is available, a quality measure 
that has been adopted by the AQA (or 
another consensus organization with 
comparable consensus-organization 
characteristics) would meet the 
requirements under the Act and we 
propose that it would be appropriate for 
eligible professionals to use the measure 
to submit quality measures data and/or 
quality measures results and numerator 
and denominator data on quality 
measures, as appropriate. 
(6) We are unaware of other 
consensus organizations that are 
comparable to the NQF in terms of 
meeting the formal requirements of the 
NTTAA or of organizations other than 
AQA that do not strictly meet the 
requirements of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology Act (NISTA) 
as amended by the NTTAA but that 
feature the breadth of stakeholder 
involvement in the consensus process 
necessary to meet the intent of the Act. 
However, the Act does not limit 
consensus organizations to the NQF or 
the AQA, nor restrict the field of 
potential consensus organizations. The 
Act, thereby, maintains flexibility in 
potential sources of measure consensus 
review, which is, like having multiple 
sources of measure development, key to 
maintaining a robust marketplace for 
development and review of quality 
measures. 
(7) The basic steps for developing 
measures applicable to physicians and 
other eligible professionals at the 
individual level may be carried out by 
a variety of different organizations. We 
do not interpret section 1848(k)(2)(B) of 
the Act to place special restrictions on 
the type or make up of the organizations 
carrying out this basic development of 
physician measures, such as restricting 
the initial development to physician- 
controlled organizations. Any such 
restriction would unduly limit the basic 
development of quality measures and 
the scope and utility of measures that 
may be considered for endorsement as 
voluntary consensus standards. 
(8) The policies we are proposing are 
based on the preference as articulated in 
NTTAA and OMB A–119 for ‘‘voluntary 
consensus standards’’ to government 
standards, and a preference for quality 
measures that have achieved broad 
consensus among stakeholders in the 
health care system. However, the Act 
does not require that quality measures 
meet the NTTAA or OMB A–119 
definition of ‘‘voluntary consensus 
standards’’ to be used for PQRI. 
4. Proposed 2009 PQRI Quality 
Measures 
The measures identified for use in 
PQRI in 2009 will be selected from 
those we propose in this rule and will 
be finalized as of the date the CY 2009 
PFS final rule with comment period 
goes on display at the Office of the 
Federal Register. No changes (that is, 
additions or deletions of measures) will 
be made after publication of the CY 
2009 PFS final rule with comment 
period. However, as was the case for 
2008, we may make modifications or 
refinements, such as revisions to 
measures titles and code additions, 
corrections, or revisions to the detailed 
specifications for the 2009 measures 
until the beginning of the reporting 
period. Such specification modifications 
may be made through the last day 
preceding the beginning of the reporting 
period. The 2009 measures 
specifications will be available on the 
PQRI section of the CMS Web site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/pqri when they 
are sufficiently developed or finalized. 
We are targeting finalization and 
publication of the detailed 
specifications for all 2009 PQRI 
measures on the PQRI section of the 
CMS Web site by November 15, 2008, 
and will in no event publish these 
specifications later than December 31, 
2008. The detailed specifications will 
include instructions for reporting and 
identify the circumstances in which 
each measure is applicable. 
For 2009, we are proposing that final 
PQRI quality measures will be selected 
from the 175 measures listed in Tables 
11 through 14, which fall into 4 broad 
categories as set forth below in this 
section. The four categories are the 
following: 
(1) 2008 PQRI Measures Proposed for 
2009; 
(2) Additional Proposed NQF- 
endorsed Measures; 
(3) Additional Proposed AQA- 
adopted Measures; and 
(4) Measures Proposed for 2009 
Contingent Upon NQF Endorsement or 
AQA Adoption by August 31, 2008. 
Given that no legislation currently exists 
that authorizes us to make incentive 
payments for satisfactorily reporting 
data on quality measures on services 
furnished in 2009 or beyond, we invite 
comments on the advisability of 
expanding the number of PQRI quality 
measures beyond the 119 measures in 
the 2008 PQRI quality measure set. 
In addition, we propose to carry 
forward three of the four measures 
groups we implemented in 2008. The 
measures proposed in eight of the nine 
total proposed measures groups are 
proposed to be available for reporting as 
individual measures or within measures 
groups and the measures in the ninth 
measures group (Back Pain) are 
proposed to be available for use in the 
2009 PQRI solely within this proposed 
measures group. The measures proposed 
for inclusion in each of the proposed 
2009 measures groups are listed in 
Tables 15 through 23. 
a. Considerations for Identifying 
Proposed 2009 PQRI Quality Measures 
We have applied several 
considerations in selecting measures to 
propose for the 2009 PQRI. We 
considered the following with respect to 
selecting the proposed measures for the 
2009 PQRI: 
(1) Measures that satisfy statutory 
criteria for selection. For purposes of 
selecting the proposed 2009 PQRI 
measures, we considered those 
measures that met the requirements of 
section 1848(k)(2) of the Act and other 
requirements discussed in section 
II.O.3.b. of this proposed rule, 
‘‘Consensus Organizations and 
Consensus-Based Process for 
Developing Measures.’’ 
(2) Measures that are functional, 
which is to say measures that can be 
technically implemented within the 
capacity of the CMS infrastructure for 
data collection, analysis, and 
calculation of reporting and 
performance rates. This leads to 
preference for measures that reflect 
readiness for implementation, such as 
those that are currently in the 2008 
PQRI program or have been through 
testing. The purpose of measure testing 
is to reveal the measure’s strengths and 
weaknesses so that the limitations can 
be addressed and the measure refined 
and strengthened prior to 
implementation. For new measures, 
preference is given to those which can 
be most efficiently implemented for data 
collection and submission. For some 
measures that are useful, but where data 
submission is not feasible through all 
otherwise available PQRI reporting 
mechanisms, a measure may be 
included for reporting solely through 
specific reporting mechanism(s) in 
which its submission is feasible. 
(3) Measures that increase the scope 
of applicability of measures to services 
rendered to Medicare beneficiaries and 
expand opportunities for eligible

professionals to participate in PQRI (for 
example, clinical topics such as skin 
care, where there are no 2008 PQRI 
measures). We seek to achieve broad 
ability to assess the quality of care 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, and 
ultimately to compare performance 
among professionals. We seek to 
increase the circumstances where 
eligible professionals have at least three 
measures applicable to their practice 
and measures that help expand the 
number of measures groups with at least 
4 measures in a group. 
(4) Measures that support CMS and 
HHS priorities for improved quality and 
efficiency of care for Medicare 
beneficiaries. These current and long 
term priority topics include: Prevention; 
chronic conditions; high cost and high 
volume conditions; elimination of 
health disparities; healthcare-associated 
infection and other conditions; 
improved care coordination; improved 
efficiency; improved patient and family 
experience of care; improved end-of- 
life/palliative care; effective 
management of acute and chronic 
episodes of care; reduced unwarranted 
geographic variation in quality and 
efficiency; and adoption and use of 
interoperable Health Information 
Technology (HIT). 
(5) Measures that are in, or facilitate, 
alignment with other Medicare, 
Medicaid, and SCHIP programs in 
furtherance of overarching healthcare 
goals. 
(6) Measures of various aspects of 
clinical quality including outcome 
measures, where appropriate and 
feasible, process measures, structural 
measures, efficiency measures and 
patient experience of care. 
In developing the list of proposed 
2009 PQRI quality measures, we also 
have reviewed and considered measure 
suggestions including comments 
received in response to the CY 2008 PFS 
proposed rule and final rule with 
comment period, and inquiries and 
suggestions received through less formal 
venues, such as an invitation for 
measures suggestions posted on the 
CMS Web site in March 2008. 
We welcome comments on the 
implication of including or excluding 
any given measure or measures 
proposed herein in the final 2009 PQRI 
quality measure set and to our approach 
in selecting measures. We recognize that 
some commenters may also wish to 
recommend additional measures for 
inclusion in the 2009 PQRI measures 
that we have not herein proposed. 
While we welcome all constructive 
comments and suggestions, and may 
consider such recommended measures 
for inclusion in future measure sets for 
PQRI and/or other programs to which 
such measures may be relevant, we will 
not be able to consider such additional 
measures for inclusion in the 2009 
measure set. 
As discussed above, section 
1848(k)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act requires that 
the measures proposed for use in the 
2009 PQRI be published in the Federal 
Register not later than August 15, 2008. 
We also are required by other applicable 
statutes to provide opportunity for 
public comment on provisions of policy 
or regulation that are established via 
notice and comment rulemaking. 
Measures that were not included in this 
proposed rule for inclusion in the 2009 
PQRI that are recommended to CMS via 
comments on this proposed rule have 
not been placed before the public with 
opportunity for the public to comment 
on them within the rulemaking process. 
Even when measures have been 
published in the Federal Register , but 
in other contexts and not specifically 
proposed as PQRI measures, such 
publication does not provide true 
opportunity for public comment on 
those measures’ potential inclusion in 
PQRI. Thus, such additional measures 
recommended via comments on this 
proposed rule cannot be included in the 
2009 measure set. Section 
1848(k)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act requires that 
the measures be finalized via 
publication in the Federal Register not 
later than November 15, 2008. However, 
as discussed above, we will consider 
comments and recommendations for 
measures, which may not be applicable 
to the final set of 2009 PQRI measures, 
for purposes of identifying measures for 
possible use in future years’ PQRI or 
other initiatives to which those 
measures may be pertinent. 
b. Proposed Measures Selected From the 
2008 PQRI Quality Measures Set 
We are proposing to include in the 
2009 PQRI quality measure set the 2008 
PQRI measures identified in Table 11 
contingent on NQF endorsement of each 
such included measure by August 31, 
2008. All 2008 PQRI measures have 
been adopted by the AQA and have 
been considered or are currently under 
consideration for endorsement by the 
NQF. Those 2008 PQRI measures that 
have been specifically considered and 
declined for endorsement are not 
included in the list of proposed 
measures for 2009. The six 2008 PQRI 
measures not included in the proposed 
measures for 2009 for this reason are: 
Measure #74, Radiation Therapy 
Recommended for Invasive Breast 
Cancer Patients who have Undergone 
Breast Conserving Surgery; Measure 
#75, Prevention of Ventilator-Associated 
Pneumonia—Head Elevation; Measure 
#80, Plan of Care for ESRD Patients with 
Anemia; Measure #103, Review of 
Treatment Options in Patients with 
Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer; 
Measure #129, Universal Influenza 
Vaccine Screening and Counseling; and 
Measure #133 Screening for Cognitive 
Impairment. Also, in some instances, 
those 2008 PQRI measures intended or 
requested by the measure developer to 
be retired from PQRI and replaced by 
new AQA-adopted or NQF-endorsed 
measures are not included in the list of 
proposed measures for 2009. The two 
2008 PQRI measures not proposed for 
this reason are: Measure #4, Screening 
for Future Fall Risk; and Measure #88, 
Hepatitis A and B Vaccination in 
Patients with HCV.

Please note that detailed measure 
specifications for 2008 PQRI measures 
may be updated or modified during the 
NQF endorsement process or for other 
reasons prior to 2009. The 2009 PQRI 
measure specifications for any given 
measure may, therefore, be different 
from specifications for the same 
measure used for 2008. Specifications 
for all 2009 measures, whether or not 
included in the 2008 PQRI program, 
must be obtained from the specifications 
document for 2009 measures, which 
will be available on the PQRI section of 
the CMS Web site on or before 
December 31, 2008. 
c. Additional Proposed NQF-Endorsed 
Measures 
We propose to include in the 2009 
PQRI quality measure set a number of 
measures endorsed by the NQF that 
were not included in the 2008 PQRI 
quality measures, which are identified 
in Table 12, provided that the measure 
retains NQF endorsement as of August 
31, 2008 and its detailed specifications 
are completed and ready for 
implementation in PQRI by October 15, 
2008. Besides having NQF endorsement, 
the development of a measure is 
considered complete for the purposes of 
the 2009 PQRI if by October 15, 2008— 
(1) the final, detailed specifications for 
use in data collection for PQRI have 
been completed and are ready for 
implementation, and (2) all of the 
Category II Current Procedural 
Terminology (CPT II) codes required for 
the measure have been established and 
will be effective for CMS claims data 
submission on or before January 1, 2009. 
Measures designated as T### in Table 
12 indicate that the measure was 
included in the 2008 Measure Testing 
Process. For 2008, we implemented a 
measures testing process for eleven 
measures that had completed consensus 
adoption or endorsement but which 
were not included in the final measures 
for use in satisfying reporting criteria to 
earn an incentive under the 2008 PQRI. 
These 2008 test measures have 
completed measures and specification 
development, have, as of the publication 
of this proposed rule, been adopted by 
the AQA and/or endorsed by the NQF, 
and have available CPT II codes that 
permit claims-based data submission. 
For the 2008 Measure Testing Process, 
eligible professionals may report any of 
these test measures by submitting the 
quality data codes identified, and as 
directed, in the test measure 
specifications on Part B claims for dates 
of services from July 1, 2008 through 
September 30, 2008. No financial 
incentive is associated with the 
reporting of these test measures for 
2008. 
We plan to analyze the number of 
quality data codes submitted for each 
specific test measure and engage in 
other summary analysis for the 
measures. No feedback reports regarding 
reporting and performance rates will be 
provided to eligible professionals who 
report on these test measures in 2008. 
Information from the analysis of the 
data submitted on the 2008 measure 
testing process will be utilized in a 
preliminary evaluation of the measures 
for data submission. This information 
can be used to inform us of a measure’s 
readiness for implementation in future 
CMS programs.

d. Additional Proposed AQA-Adopted 
Measures 
As discussed in section II.O.3.b. of 
this proposed rule, Consensus 
Organizations and Consensus-Based 
Process for Developing Measures, in 
circumstances where no NQF-endorsed 
measure is available, a quality measure 
that has been adopted by the AQA 
would also meet the requirements of 
section 1848(k)(2)(B)(i) of the Act. As 
such, we propose to include in the final 
2009 PQRI quality measure set measures 
adopted by AQA that have not yet been 
reviewed or endorsed by the NQF and 
that were not included in the final set 
of 2008 PQRI quality measures. 
We propose to include in the 2009 
PQRI quality measures each of the AQA- 
adopted measures identified in Table 
13, provided that, as of August 31, 2008, 
the measure retains AQA adoption, has 
not been reviewed and declined for 
endorsement by NQF, and its detailed 
specifications are completed and ready 
for implementation in PQRI by October 
15, 2008. Besides being adopted by the 
AQA, a measure is considered ready for 
implementation for the purposes of the 
2009 PQRI if by October 15, 2008—(1) 
the final, detailed specifications for use 
of the measure in data collection for 
PQRI have been completed and are 
ready for implementation, and (2) all of 
the CPT II codes required for the 
measure have been established and will 
be effective for CMS claims data 
submission on or before January 1, 2009. 
As explained above in section II.O.4.c., 
‘‘Additional Proposed NQF-Endorsed 
Measures,’’ measures designated as 
T### in Table 13 indicate that the 
measure is one of eleven measures 
included in the 2008 Measure Testing 
Process. As also explained above in

the table below that are not designated 
as T### are not part of the 2008 PQRI

measures may have CPT II codes 
identified or specified, but those codes 
may or may not be recognized as active, 
valid codes in the Medicare claims-

e. Additional Proposed Measures 
Contingent Upon NQF Endorsement or 
AQA Adoption by August 31, 2008 
We are proposing to include in the 
2009 PQRI measure set certain measures 
that are not yet NQF-endorsed or AQA- 
adopted, provided that the measure will 
be so endorsed or adopted as of August 
31, 2008, and its detailed specifications 
are completed and ready for 
implementation in PQRI by October 15, 
2008. 
The measures we propose to include 
in the 2009 PQRI quality measure set are 
identified in Table 14. Besides being 
NQF-endorsed or AQA-adopted, a 
measure is considered ready for 
implementation for the purposes of the 
2009 PQRI if by October 15, 2008—(1) 
the final, detailed specifications for use 
of the measure in data collection for 
PQRI have been completed and are 
ready for implementation, and (2) all of 
the CPT II codes required for the 
measure have been established and will 
be effective for CMS claims based 
submission on or before January 1, 2009.

also are not proposing to retain all of the 
measures contained in those groups as 
2009 PQRI measures. In some cases, we 
may propose different or additional 
measures for inclusion in a particular 
measures group for use in 2009, 
compared to 2008. Therefore, the 
composition of the Diabetes Mellitus, 
CKD, and Preventive Care measures 
groups may be different for the 2009 
PQRI than for the 2008 PQRI. The 
measures proposed for inclusion in the 
2009 Diabetes Mellitus, CKD, and 
Preventive Care measures groups are 
listed in Tables 15 through 17. 
Some measures proposed for 
inclusion in a 2009 measures group are 
current 2008 PQRI measures. The title of 
each such measure is preceded with its 
PQRI Measure Number in Tables 15 
through 23. The PQRI Measure Number 
is a unique identifier assigned by CMS 
to all measures in the PQRI measure set. 
Once a PQRI Measure Number is 
assigned to a measure, it will not be 
used again, even if the measure is 
subsequently retired from the PQRI 
measure set. Measures that are not 
preceded by a number have never been 
part of a PQRI measure set. As with 
measures group reporting in the 2008 
PQRI, each eligible professional electing 
to report a group of measures for 2009 
must report all measures in the group 
that are applicable to each patient or 
encounter to which the measures group 
applies at least up to the minimum 
number of patients required by 
applicable reporting criteria (described 
above in section II.O.2.b., Satisfactory 
Reporting of Data on Quality Measures 
and Reporting Periods for Measures 
Groups, Through Claims-Based 
Reporting and Registry-Based 
Reporting’’).

g. Quality Measures Reviewed and Not 
Proposed for 2009 PQRI 
In developing the list of proposed 
2009 PQRI quality measures, we have 
reviewed both formal and informal 
measure suggestions ranging from 
comments received in response to the 
CY 2008 PFS proposed rule and final 
rule with comment period to inquiries 
and suggestions received through less 
formal venues, including but not limited 
to an invitation posted on the CMS Web 
site in March 2008 for suggestions of 
measures for consideration for potential 
inclusion in PQRI. For those quality 
measures reviewed but not included in 
the list of proposed 2009 PQRI quality 
measures, we may consider including 
such measures in a 2009 Measure 
Testing Process similar to the 2008 
Measure Testing Process described 
above. 
Measures selected for inclusion in the 
2009 Measure Testing Process will be 
limited to measures that have completed 
development, including having 
achieved consensus endorsement or 
adoption, and for which CPT II codes 
are available by January 1, 2009. The 
2009 Measure Testing Process is 
planned for April 1, 2009 through June 
30, 2009. We plan to analyze the 
number of quality data codes submitted 
for the specific test measures and engage 
in other summary analysis for the 
measures. No calculations will be made 
at the individual or physician level. 
As discussed previously, no 
legislation exists that authorizes us to 
make incentive payments for 
satisfactorily reporting data on quality 
measures on services furnished in 2009. 
No financial incentive payment will be 
associated with the reporting of these 
test measures for 2009. Information from 
this analysis of the data submitted on 
measures identified for the 2009 
Measure Testing Process will be utilized 
in a preliminary evaluation of the 
measures. This information can be used 
to inform us of a measure’s readiness for 
implementation in future CMS 
programs. 
5. Summary of Program Considerations 
for the PQRI in 2009 and Beyond 
In summary, we have invited public 
comment on the following areas for the 
2009 PQRI through this proposed rule: 
• Implications of including or 
excluding any given measure from the 
set of proposed 2009 quality measures 
as listed in Tables 11, 12, 13, and 14. 
Suggestions to include measures for the 
2009 PQRI other than those we have 
proposed for inclusion will not be 
considered for 2009. However, any such 
suggestions may be considered in future 
years for use in PQRI or for other 
initiatives to which those measures may 
be pertinent. 
• The new measures groups proposed 
for 2009 including suggestions for other 
measures groups based on individual 
measures included in the proposed 2009 
PQRI measures set. 
• The proposed use of the 
consecutive patient reporting criteria for 
measures groups. 
• The proposed use of 30 consecutive 
patients as the required sample under 
the consecutive patient reporting 
criteria during the full-year 2009 
reporting period. 
• The proposed options and planned 
use of registries for registry-based 
quality measures results and numerator 
and denominator data on quality 
measures data reporting to PQRI in 
2009. 
• The advisability of expanding the 
number of PQRI quality measures 
beyond the 119 measures in the 2008 
PQRI quality measures set given that 
there is no specific authorization for an 
incentive payment for the 2009 PQRI 
and beyond. 
6. Uses of PQRI Information 
On August 22, 2006, President Bush 
issued an Executive Order, ‘‘Promoting 
Quality and Efficient Health Care in 
Federal Government Administered or 
Sponsored Health Care Programs,’’ 
which requires the Federal Government, 
to the extent permitted by law, to— 
• Ensure that Federal health care 
programs promote quality and efficient 
delivery of health care using 
interoperable health information 
technology, transparency regarding 
health care quality and price, and better 
incentives for program beneficiaries, 
enrollees, and providers.

38575 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
• Make relevant information available 
to these beneficiaries, enrollees, and 
providers in a readily useable manner 
and in collaboration with similar 
initiatives in the private sector and non- 
Federal public sector. 
To support this mandate, the 
Secretary has embraced ‘‘four 
cornerstones’’ for building a value- 
driven health care system: 
(1) Connecting the health system 
through the use of interoperable health 
information technology; 
(2) Measuring and publishing 
information about quality; 
(3) Measuring and publishing 
information about price; and 
(4) Using incentives to promote high- 
quality and cost-effective care (see 
http://www.hss.gov/valuedriven). 
Building on these four cornerstones, 
we have articulated a vision for health 
care—the right care, for every person, 
every time. To achieve this vision, we 
seek to implement policies that will 
promote the delivery of care that is safe, 
effective, timely, patient-centered, 
efficient, and equitable. In working to 
achieve this vision, and in support of 
the four cornerstones, we have launched 
an initiative, of which PQRI is a part, 
directed toward measuring the quality 
of care for services provided to 
Medicare beneficiaries and to make 
such information publicly available. We 
currently have Web pages at http:// 
www.medicare.gov for the public 
reporting of quality data for hospitals 
(Hospital Compare), dialysis facilities 
(Dialysis Facility Compare), nursing 
homes (Nursing Home Compare) and 
home health facilities (Home Health 
Compare). On these Web pages, we 
make performance results on 
standardized quality measures for the 
various facilities publicly available. 
This information is used by the facilities 
for their own quality improvement 
purposes, by the public to make 
informed healthcare decisions, and, in 
some cases, for our payment incentive 
programs that are designed to promote 
the delivery of high quality services and 
to ensure high value for Medicare 
beneficiaries. To date, we have not 
made information on the quality of care 
for services provided by physicians to 
Medicare beneficiaries publicly 
available. However, we are 
contemplating a similar ‘‘Physician 
Compare’’ Web site that would enhance 
the information found on the Physician 
Directory (see http://www.medicare.gov/ 
Physician/Home.asp?bhcp=1) to include 
information about the quality of care 
and value for services provided by 
professionals to Medicare beneficiaries 
in the future. There are a variety of data 
sources that could provide quality of 
care, value, and other information for 
services provided by professionals to 
Medicare beneficiaries that could be 
used to develop a Physician Compare 
Web site. 
With respect to the PQRI, the data on 
PQRI quality measures is submitted at 
the individual (that is, NPI) level by 
physicians and other eligible 
professionals. Such data could be the 
basis for public reporting of quality 
measurement performance results at 
either the individual or group (that is, 
TIN) level. Our plans with respect to 
public reporting of PQRI data have been 
a subject of public interest. In response 
to public comments received on the 
issue of public reporting of PQRI data, 
we stated in the CY 2008 PFS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66337) that 
‘‘[w]e do not at this time plan to make 
results publicly available in a format or 
with content that would enable 
identification of individual 
professionals or specific practices’ 
specific reporting or performance 
results. We have not made a 
determination as to the most 
appropriate venue(s) for making PQRI 
evaluation information available to the 
public.’’ 
Nevertheless, in 2007, we published a 
notice of a new system of records (SOR) 
under the Privacy Act entitled, 
‘‘Performance Measurement and 
Reporting System,’’ System No. 09–70– 
0584 (72 FR 52133 through 52140) for 
the public release of PQRI data. Under 
the SOR we established a routine use 
that would enable us to make individual 
physician-level performance 
measurement results information 
available to Medicare beneficiaries, by 
posting it on a public Web site and by 
various other methods of data 
dissemination, which may include 
performance information that is 
reported by physicians pursuant to 
PQRI. 
Although not required by the statute 
authorizing PQRI we have, from the 
beginning, regarded providing 
physicians and other eligible 
professionals an opportunity to review 
their data on reporting rates and 
performance rates on PQRI quality 
measures as an important aspect of the 
program. This derives from the 
fundamental interest in quality 
improvement that underlies the 
program. Thus, we included a 
confidential feedback mechanism for 
physicians as part of the Physician 
Voluntary Reporting Program which 
preceded PQRI. We extended and 
expanded the confidential feedback 
mechanism for the 2007 PQRI. These 
feedback reports are scheduled to be 
available starting in mid-July 2008 at the 
time the incentive payments for 2007 
PQRI are made. The feedback reports 
will not only assist eligible 
professionals in quality improvement 
but will also provide us with an 
important source of input for evaluation 
of PQRI measures, the performance 
calculation methods, and the PQRI 
program. For the 2008 PQRI data that is 
currently being submitted, we will 
continue to provide a confidential 
feedback process. For the 2008 PQRI 
data, consistent with information that 
we have previously provided, we do not 
intend to publicly report performance 
results at the individual or group level; 
but we may publicly report the names 
of eligible professionals who report and/ 
or satisfactorily report quality data 
under the 2008 PQRI. 
As part of our broader goal to measure 
and make the quality of care for services 
provided to Medicare beneficiaries 
publicly available and in support of the 
four cornerstones, we anticipate making 
information on the quality of care for 
services provided by professionals to 
Medicare beneficiaries publicly 
available in the future. In future years, 
we will also explore using information 
collected from the PQRI, including 
performance results, for this purpose. 
To assist us in determining the most 
appropriate uses of PQRI data, we invite 
comments on the following issues: 
• Ways to effectively engage eligible 
professionals, consumers, and other 
stakeholders in the development and 
evaluation of a valid and reliable public 
reporting system related to professional 
services provided to Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
• The venue and format for how PQRI 
information should be made publicly 
available. 
• Types of data that would be most 
useful and meaningful to consumers (for 
example, reporting results and/or 
performance results). 
• Types of data that would be most 
useful and meaningful for professionals. 
• Level at which PQRI information 
should be publicly reported (that is, at 
the individual professional, or NPI, 
level or the group, or TIN, level). 
• Types of PQRI measures and/or 
measures groups that would be most 
useful and meaningful to consumers. 
• Types of PQRI measures and/or 
measures groups that would be most 
useful and meaningful to professionals. 
• Review of the data to be publicly 
reported by eligible professionals.

38576 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
DEMONSTRATION’’ at the beginning of 
your comments.] 
In the CY 2006, CY 2007, and CY 
2008 PFS final rules with comment 
period (70 FR 70266, 71 FR 69707, 72 
FR 66325, respectively), we included a 
discussion of the 2-year chiropractic 
services demonstration that ended on 
March 31, 2007. This demonstration 
was required by section 651 of the MMA 
to evaluate the feasibility and 
advisability of covering chiropractic 
services under Medicare. These services 
extended beyond the current coverage 
for manipulation to care for 
neuromusculoskeletal conditions 
typical among eligible beneficiaries, and 
covered diagnostic and other services 
that a chiropractor was legally 
authorized to perform by the State or 
jurisdiction in which the treatment was 
provided. The demonstration was 
conducted in four sites, two rural and 
two urban. The demonstration was 
required to be budget neutral as the 
statute requires the Secretary to ensure 
that the aggregate payment made under 
the Medicare program does not exceed 
the amount which would be paid in the 
absence of the demonstration. 
Ensuring budget neutrality requires 
that the Secretary develop a strategy for 
recouping funds should the 
demonstration result in costs higher 
than those that would occur in the 
absence of the demonstration. As we 
stated in the CY 2006 and CY 2007 PFS 
final rules with comment period, we 
would make adjustments to the 
chiropractor fees under the Medicare 
PFS to recover aggregate payments 
under the demonstration in excess of 
the amount estimated to yield budget 
neutrality. We will assess budget 
neutrality by determining the change in 
costs based on a pre- and post- 
comparison of aggregate payments and 
the rate of change for specific diagnoses 
that were treated by chiropractors and 
physicians in the demonstration sites 
and control sites. Because the aggregate 
payments under the expanded 
chiropractor services may have an 
impact on other Medicare expenditures, 
we will not limit our analysis to 
reviewing only chiropractor claims. 
Any needed reduction to chiropractor 
fees under the PFS would be made in 
the CY 2010 and CY 2011 physician fee 
schedules as it will take approximately 
2 years after the demonstration ends to 
complete the claims analysis. If we 
determine that the adjustment for BN is 
greater than 2 percent of spending for 
the chiropractor fee schedule codes 
(comprised of the 3 currently covered 
CPT codes 98940, 98941, and 98942), 
we would implement the adjustment 
over a 2-year period. However, if the 
adjustment is less than 2 percent of 
spending under the chiropractor fee 
schedule codes, we would implement 
the adjustment over a 1-year period. We 
intend to provide a detailed analysis of 
budget neutrality and the proposed 
offset during the CY 2010 PFS 
rulemaking process. 
Q. Educational Requirements for Nurse 
Practitioners and Clinical Nurse 
Specialists 
[If you choose to comment on issues in 
this section, please include the caption 
‘‘EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND 
CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALISTS’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
We are proposing a technical 
correction to the nurse practitioner (NP) 
qualifications at § 410.75(b) to require 
that, in order for NP services furnished 
by an individual to be covered by 
Medicare, a NP who obtains Medicare 
billing privileges as a NP for the first 
time ever on or after January 1, 2003, 
must be a registered professional nurse 
who is authorized by State law to 
practice as a NP, must be nationally 
certified as a NP, and must have a 
master’s degree in nursing. The current 
NP qualification standards under these 
Federal regulations include progressive 
requirements, but not entirely date 
specific. The absence of a date 
specification for each of the 
qualification standards could allow 
nurses who have never been enrolled 
under Medicare and obtained Medicare 
billing privileges as a NP an opportunity 
to enroll as a NP after January 1, 2003 
without a master’s degree in nursing. 
Such an enrollment would be contrary 
to our policy, as explained further 
below. 
We discussed the NP qualifications 
and our intent to move progressively 
toward requiring a master’s degree in 
nursing as the standard for all new NPs 
enrolling and participating under the 
Medicare Part B benefit for NPs in our 
July 22, 1999 proposed rule (64 FR 
39625) and the subsequent final rule (64 
FR 59411). We stated under this final 
rule that, ‘‘the requirement that a NP 
applying for a Medicare billing number 
for the first time must have a master’s 
degree in nursing as of January 1, 2003, 
will provide NPs without a master’s 
degree with enough time to earn such a 
degree. We believe it is reasonable to 
require ultimately, a master’s degree as 
the minimum educational level for new 
practitioners independently treating 
beneficiaries and directly billing the 
Medicare program.’’ 
We are also proposing to amend the 
requirement in our regulations at 
§ 410.75(b)(4) that NPs must have a 
master’s degree in nursing in order to 
also recognize a Doctor of Nursing 
Practice (DNP) doctoral degree (which 
can be obtained without a master’s 
degree in nursing). In addition, we are 
proposing to amend a similar 
qualification standard for clinical nurse 
specialists (CNSs) at § 410.76(b)(2) that 
requires advanced practice nurses 
(APNs) to have a master’s degree in a 
defined clinical area of nursing from an 
accredited educational institution in 
order to allow CNSs, alternatively, to 
meet these requirements with a DNP 
doctoral degree. 
We are aware that some educational 
institutions are offering programs to 
prospective NPs and CNSs that allow 
students who complete these nursing 
education programs to move from a 
baccalaureate degree in nursing directly 
to the doctoral degree in nursing where 
they earn a terminal clinical doctoral 
degree titled the DNP. Therefore, some 
APNs who earn the DNP degree do not 
receive a master’s degree in nursing 
even though they will have met all of 
the educational requirements for a 
master’s degree in nursing, in addition 
to the preparation that merits them the 
DNP degree. We note that an April 2, 
2008 article in the Wall Street Journal 
stated that by the year 2015, the 
American Association of Colleges of 
Nursing aims to make the doctoral 
degree the standard for all new APNs. 
We believe that it is logical for Medicare 
Part B to recognize APNs with more 
extensive education and training. 
Therefore, we propose to permit 
qualified APNs with the DNP degree to 
enroll and receive Medicare Part B 
payment as NPs and CNSs. 
R. Portable X-Ray Issue 
[If you choose to comment on issues in 
this section, please include the caption 
‘‘PORTABLE X-RAY ISSUE’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
The Conditions for Coverage (CfC) for 
Portable X-Ray services are authorized 
by section 1861(s)(3) of the Act and 
were adopted January 1969. These 
requirements have, for the most part, 
been subjected to minimal modification 
over the years. 
The current requirements in our 
regulations at § 486.104 (Qualifications, 
orientation, and health of technical 
personnel) are inconsistent with 
existing professional standards of 
practice and training requirements. 
Specifically, the current qualification 
requirements for x-ray personnel in 
§ 486.104(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) rely on 
credentialing activities from the Council 
on Education of the American Medical 
Association (CEAMA) and the American

38577 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
Osteopathic Association (AOA) which 
no longer approve formal training 
programs for x-ray technology and have 
not done so since 1992. 
Beginning in 1976, the Joint Review 
Committee on Education in Radiologic 
Technology (JRCERT) worked in 
collaboration with the Committee on 
Allied Health Education and 
Accreditation (CAHEA) of the American 
Medical Association (AMA) to accredit 
programs. However, the CAHEA was 
dissolved by the AMA in 1992 and 
JRCERT subsequently sought approval 
from the United States Department of 
Education (USDE) to approve and 
accredit x-ray technology programs. 
Approval was granted to JRCERT by the 
USDE in 1992. JRCERT is now the only 
accrediting entity that approves these 
programs; however, JCERT is not a 
recognized accrediting body under the 
current regulation at § 486.104. 
Before an x-ray technology program 
can be approved by JRCERT, the 
American Society of Radiologic 
Technologists (ASRT) must approve the 
program’s curriculum. Prior to 1992, the 
curriculum for x-ray technology 
programs was based on 24 months, 
which is reflected in the current 
regulations at § 486.104. ASRT no 
longer bases its evaluation on program 
duration, but rather on program 
requirements. Thus, a program could be 
less than 24 months in duration and still 
be eligible for JRCERT approval and 
accreditation if its curriculum was 
ASRT approved. Because § 486.104(a)(1) 
reflects the outdated 24-month standard, 
some x-ray technicians who actually 
meet community standards for 
education and training do not meet 
Medicare standards as they stand. 
Since the current Medicare 
requirements in § 486.104(a)(1) are 
outdated, referring organizations that no 
longer perform the stated function and 
requiring a specific duration of training 
that is no longer the community 
standard, we are proposing to revise the 
regulation to reflect the current 
requirements. References to schools 
approved by the CEAMA or the AOA 
will be deleted, and approval by 
JRCERT will be added. In addition, we 
propose that the requirement for formal 
training of not less than 24 months in 
duration be deleted, since this criterion 
is not part of the criteria established by 
entities that evaluate and approve x-ray 
technology programs since 1993. 
We propose to retain the 24 month 
criterion in § 486.104(a)(2) and (a)(3) 
(affecting persons obtaining training 
prior to July 1, 1966) as program 
duration was one determinant of 
program quality at that time. To address 
those who completed their training after 
July 1, 1966 but before January 1, 1993, 
the time period during which CEAMA 
and the AOA were approving training 
programs, we propose the addition of a 
new paragraph § 486.104(a)(4) to this 
section. This addition will reflect the 
standards for credentialing activities 
during this time frame. 
S. Expiring Provisions and Related 
Discussions 
[If you choose to comment on issues in 
this section, please include the caption 
‘‘EXPIRING PROVISIONS’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
1. Physician Fee Schedule Update 
As discussed in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period, the update 
formula for payment for services under 
the PFS resulted in a reduction of 10.1 
percent in the conversion factor (CF) for 
CY 2008. Section 101 of the MMSEA 
provides for a 0.5 percent increase in 
the CF for the period beginning on 
January 1, 2008 and ending on June 30, 
2008, resulting in a CF of $38.0870. For 
the remaining portion of 2008 (July 1 
through December 31, 2008), under 
current law the CF will reflect the 
¥10.1 percent update, and the CF will 
be $34.0682, as published in the CY 
2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period (72 FR 66222). This represents a 
10.6 percent reduction from the 
payments in the first half of 2008. 
Section 101 of the MMSEA also 
modifies the Physician Quality 
Reporting System for CY 2008 and 2009. 
2. Medicare Incentive Payment for 
Physician Scarcity Areas 
Section 1833(u) of the Act provides 
for a 5 percent incentive payment to 
physicians furnishing services in 
physician scarcity areas (PSAs) for 
physicians’ services furnished on or 
after January 1, 2005, and before January 
1, 2008. In the CY 2008 PFS final rule 
with comment period (72 FR 66293), we 
provided notification that these 
incentive payments authorized by 
section 1833(u) of the Act would no 
longer be made for services furnished on 
or after January 1, 2008. Section 102 of 
the MMSEA provides for an extension 
of these bonus payments through June 
30, 2008. During this 6-month extension 
period, the MMSEA required that we 
use the primary care scarcity counties 
and specialty care scarcity counties that 
we were using for purposed of these 
incentive payments on December 31, 
2007. 
Because under current law the 
provisions of section 1833(u) of the Act 
do not apply to services furnished after 
June 30, 2008, we are providing notice 
that these 5 percent incentive payments 
will no longer be made for services 
furnished on or after July 1, 2008. 
3. Extension of Floor for Work GPCI 
As discussed in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
66243), section 102 of the MIEA– 
TRHCA requires application of a 1.000 
floor on the work GPCI in fee schedule 
areas where the work GPCI is less than 
1.000. This provision concerning the 
work GPCI was set to expire on 
December 31, 2007. Section 103 of the 
MMSEA provides for an extension of 
this 1.000 floor on the work GPCI 
through June 30, 2008. Under current 
law, the 1.000 floor on the work GPCI 
will no longer be used to calculate 
payment for services furnished on after 
July 1, 2008. 
4. Extension of Treatment of Certain 
Physician Pathology Services Under 
Medicare 
The technical component (TC) of 
physician pathology services refers to 
the preparation of the slide involving 
tissue or cells that a pathologist will 
interpret. In contrast, the pathologist’s 
interpretation of the slide is the 
professional component (PC) service. If 
the PC service is furnished by the 
hospital pathologist for a hospital 
patient, it is separately billable. If the 
independent laboratory’s pathologist 
furnishes the PC service, it is usually 
billed with the TC service as a 
combined service. 
Section 542 of the Medicare, 
Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits 
Improvement and Protection Act of 
2000 (Pub. L. 106–554) (BIPA) 
established the billing exception that 
allowed certain qualified independent 
laboratories to continue to bill the 
carrier under the PFS for the TC of 
physician pathology services furnished 
to a hospital patient. In order to bill in 
this manner, an independent laboratory 
must have had an arrangement with a 
hospital in effect as of July 22, 1999 
under which the laboratory furnished 
the TC physician pathology service to a 
hospital patient and submitted claims to 
the carrier for payment. Through 
subsequent legislation (that is, section 
732 of the MMA and section 104 of the 
MIEA–TRHCA), this provision had been 
extended through 2007. If the 
independent laboratory did not qualify 
under this provision, then it must 
continue to bill the hospital and receive 
payment from that hospital. As a result 
of this provision, the TC of physician 
pathology services could be reimbursed 
differently depending on the status of 
the laboratory. 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period (72 FR 66355),

38578 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
consistent with section 104 of the 
MIEA–TRHCA, we amended 
§ 415.130(d) to reflect that for services 
furnished after December 31, 2007, an 
independent laboratory may not bill the 
carrier for the technical component of 
physician pathology services furnished 
to a hospital inpatient or outpatient. 
Section 104 of the MMSEA allows 
independent laboratories to continue to 
bill the carrier for the TC of physician 
pathology services for hospital 
inpatients or outpatients through June 
30, 2008. We are amending § 415.130(d) 
to reflect this change. 
5. Therapy Cap and Extension of 
Exceptions Process 
Section 1833(g)(1) of the Act applies 
an annual per beneficiary combined cap 
beginning January 1, 1999, on outpatient 
physical therapy and speech-language 
pathology services, and a similar 
separate cap on outpatient occupational 
therapy services. These caps apply to 
expenses incurred for the respective 
therapy services under Medicare Part B, 
with the exception of therapy services 
furnished as outpatient hospital 
services. 
As discussed in the CY 2008 PFS final 
rule with comment period (72 FR 
66356), an exceptions process for the 
therapy caps, which was authorized by 
section 5107 of the DRA, was extended 
through December 31, 2007 by section 
201 of the MIEA–TRHCA. Section 105 
of the MMSEA provides for a further 
extension of this exceptions process 
through the first 6 months of CY 2008 
(that is, on or before June 30, 2008). 
In accordance with the statute, we 
will continue to implement therapy 
caps, but the exceptions process will no 
longer be applicable, for services 
furnished beginning on July 1, 2008. 
The dollar amount of the therapy caps 
in CY 2009 will be the CY 2008 rate 
($1,810) increased by the percentage 
increase in the MEI as required by 
section 1833(g)(2) of the Act. 
6. Bonus Payment for Long 
Ambulance Transports 
Section 414 of the MMA added 
section 1834(l)(11) of the Act which 
requires that, ‘‘[i]n the case of ground 
ambulance services furnished on or after 
July 1, 2004, and before January 1, 2009, 
regardless of where the transportation 
originates, the fee schedule established 
under this subsection shall provide that, 
with respect to the payment rate for 
mileage for a trip above 50 miles the per 
mile rate otherwise established shall be 
increased by 1⁄4 of the payment per mile 
otherwise applicable to miles in excess 
of 50 miles in such trip.’’ Section 
1834(l)(11) of the Act was implemented 
in § 414.610(c)(7), which states that for 
services furnished during the period 
July 1, 2004 through December 31, 2008, 
each loaded ambulance mile greater 
than 50 miles (that is, 51 miles and 
greater) for ambulance transports 
originating in either urban areas or in 
rural areas is paid at a rate that is 25 
percent higher than otherwise would be 
applicable under § 414.610. 
Because the provisions of section 
1834(l)(11) of the Act do not apply to 
services furnished on or after January 1, 
2009, we are providing a reminder that 
the 25 percent bonus payments 
provided under section 1834(l)(11) of 
the Act, and under § 414.610(c)(7), will 
no longer be paid for services furnished 
on or after January 1, 2009. 
7. Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule 
(CLFS) Update Factor 
Outpatient clinical laboratory services 
are paid under the clinical laboratory 
fee schedule (CLFS) in accordance with 
section 1833(h) of the Act. Under 
section 1833 (a)(1)(D) of the Act, 
payment is the lesser of the following: 
The amount billed; the local fee for a 
geographic area; or a national limit. In 
accordance with the statute, the national 
limits are set at a percent of the median 
for all local fee schedule amounts for 
each laboratory test code. While section 
1833(h)(2)(A)(i) of the Act specifies that 
the fees are to be updated for inflation 
based on the Consumer Price Index for 
All Urban Consumers (CPI–U), the 
Congress modified the update to zero 
percent for CY 2004 through CY 2008. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, this freeze 
expires. As a result, for CY 2009, the 
CLFS will be updated by the percentage 
increase in the CPI–U using the 12- 
month period ending with June of the 
previous year. 
At this time, the CPI–U for the 12- 
month period ending June 30, 2008 is 
not available. We do not undertake 
notice and comment rulemaking to 
announce the CLFS update factor 
because the statute specifies the 
methods of computation of annual 
inflation updates, and we have no 
discretion in that matter. Thus, we 
merely apply the update methods 
specified in the statute. We will 
announce the CLFS update factor via 
CMS instructions by including a section 
in our annual CLFS Change Request 
instruction and by including the 
information on the CMS Clinical 
Laboratory Fee Schedule Web site in 
approximately November of each year 
so that the industry can remain aware of 
future CLFS update factors. 
T. Other Issues 
1. Physician Certification (G0180) and 
Recertification (G0179) for Medicare- 
Covered Home Health Services Under a 
Home Health Plan of Care (POC) in the 
Home Health Prospective Payment 
System (HH PPS) 
[If you choose to comment on issues in 
this section, please include the caption 
‘‘OTHER ISSUES—PHYSICIAN 
CERTIFICATION/RECERTIFICATION’’ 
at the beginning of your comments.] 
a. Background 
Under the home health benefit, the 
statute requires that the physician 
review the plan of care (POC) for the 
home health eligible beneficiary. 
Sections 1814(a)(2)(C) and 1835(a)(2)(A) 
of the Act require that a plan for 
furnishing home health services to such 
individuals has been established and 
that plan is periodically reviewed by a 
physician for Medicare payment to be 
made. Section 409.43(e) more 
specifically states that a home health 
POC must be reviewed, signed, and 
dated by the physician who reviews the 
POC (as specified in § 409.42(b)) in 
consultation with agency clinical staff at 
least every 60 days (or more frequently 
as specified in § 409.43(e)(i) through 
(iii)). Additionally, § 424.22(b) states 
that a recertification is required at least 
every 60 days, preferably at the time the 
plan is reviewed, and must be signed by 
the physician who reviews the home 
health POC. These schedules, for the 
review of the POC and the 
recertification, coordinate well with the 
60-day episode payment unit under the 
home health prospective payment 
system (HH PPS). In implementing the 
statutory requirement as well as these 
regulations, we believed that these 
requirements would encourage 
enhanced physician involvement in the 
home health POC and patient 
management, and would include more 
direct ‘‘in-person’’ patient encounters 
(as logistically feasible). 
Currently, physicians are paid for 
both the certification and recertification 
of the home health POC under HCPCS 
codes G0180 and G0179, respectively. 
The basis for the payment amounts of 
these physicians’ services is the relative 
resources in RVUs required to furnish 
these services. We believe physician 
involvement is key to maintaining 
quality of care under the HH PPS and 
payment for the required physician 
certification and recertification of home 
health POCs reflects this. 
In the HH PPS proposed rule 
published in the October 28, 1999 
Federal Register (64 FR 58196), we had 
also proposed to require the physician

38579 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
to certify the appropriate case-mix 
weight/home health resource group 
(HHRG) as part of the required 
physician certification of the plan of 
care. This reflected our belief that the 
physician should be more involved in 
the decentralized delivery of home 
health services. However, in the final 
rule published in the July 3, 2000 
Federal Register (65 FR 41163), we did 
not finalize that proposal and decided to 
focus our attention on physician 
certification and education in order to 
better involve the physician in the 
delivery of home health services. 
b. Solicitation of Comments 
It has come to our attention that there 
exists a vast array of differing levels of 
physician involvement in the 
certification and recertification of home 
health POCs. Although some physicians 
do have direct contact with their 
patients in the delivery of these 
services, we believe a significant 
number of physicians provide only a 
brief, albeit thorough, review of the 
home health POC, without any direct 
contact with the patient. Still, other 
physicians are involved to an even 
lesser degree in their review of the home 
health POC and/or direct contact with 
the patient in the delivery of these 
services. We continue to believe that the 
active involvement of the physician 
including ‘‘in-person’’ contact with the 
patient in the certification, 
recertification, and review of the home 
health POC is essential for delivery of 
high quality home health services to 
Medicare beneficiaries. 
To that end, we are exploring a couple 
of different options. First, we are 
considering a review of the RVUs 
associated with the certification (G0180) 
and recertification (G0179) of the home 
health POC. As a result of that review, 
the payment amounts to physicians 
could be reduced based on a more 
accurate determination of the actual 
RVUs required to provide these services. 
Because we continue to believe that the 
active involvement of the physician is 
important in delivering these home 
health services, reducing the payment 
for these services may not encourage 
physicians to spend additional time 
reviewing and modifying beneficiaries’ 
home health plans of care to assure that 
the plan addresses all of the 
beneficiaries’ needs. We are also 
considering proposing new 
requirements to ensure more active 
physician involvement in the 
certification and recertification of the 
home health patient’s POC, for example, 
a requirement for ‘‘direct’’ patient 
contact with the physician. We are 
specifically soliciting comments on 
these policy options in an effort to 
gather more information on this issue, 
and any other possible underlying 
issues that may exist. 
2. Prohibition Concerning Providers of 
Sleep Tests 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘OTHER ISSUES-SLEEP 
TESTS’’ at the beginning of your 
comments.] 
a. Background 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea 
Syndrome, also known as Obstructive 
Sleep Apnea (OSA), is the most 
common of the three different forms of 
sleep apnea (obstructive, central, or 
mixed). OSA is associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality, 
including excessive daytime sleepiness, 
concentration difficulty, cardiovascular 
disease, and stroke. Untreated OSA is 
associated with a ten-fold increase in 
the risk of motor vehicle accidents. 
Diagnostic tests for OSA are based on 
detection of abnormal sleep patterns 
using sleep test devices that record a 
variety of cardiorespiratory and 
neurophysiologic signals during sleep 
time called polysomnography (PSG). 
Historically, such sleep tests have been 
furnished in a sleep laboratory attended 
by a sleep technologist. More recently, 
portable sleep test devices have been 
developed for the diagnosis of OSA in 
the home (either attended or 
unattended). Sleep test devices are 
classified into four types based 
primarily on the extent of sleep pattern 
data recorded. The most comprehensive 
is designated Type I: attended in-facility 
PSG. The remaining three types concern 
portable sleep test devices developed for 
the diagnosis of OSA and used both in 
attended and unattended settings, often 
in the home. Type II devices have a 
minimum of 7 monitored channels; for 
example, electroencephalogram (EEG), 
electro-oculogram (EOG), 
electromyogram (EMG), 
electrocardiogram (EKG)-heart rate, 
airflow, respiratory effort, and oxygen 
saturation. Type III devices have a 
minimum of 4 monitored channels 
including ventilation or airflow, at least 
two channels of respiratory movement 
or respiratory movement and airflow, 
heart rate or EKG, and oxygen 
saturation. Type IV devices do not meet 
the technical criteria defining the other 
types, and many measure only one or 
two parameters, for example, oxygen 
saturation or airflow, but some Type IV 
devices measure three or more 
parameters. There are other technologies 
that do not readily fall into the 
classification above. 
Sleep testing, like other diagnostic 
tests, is subject to the provisions in 
§ 410.32. Thus, it must be ordered by 
the physician who is treating the 
beneficiary for a specific medical 
problem and who uses the results in the 
management of the beneficiary’s specific 
medical problem. Sleep testing must be 
furnished under the required level of 
supervision by a physician. If the sleep 
testing is furnished by an independent 
diagnostic testing facility (IDTF) the 
provisions of § 410.33 also apply. 
A number of treatment approaches 
have been recommended for persons 
diagnosed with OSA, depending on 
severity of the disorder and other 
clinical factors. Patients with moderate 
to severe OSA are usually treated at first 
with continuous positive air pressure 
(CPAP) devices. The regular use of a 
CPAP device in these cases has been 
shown to improve excessive sleepiness, 
cognitive performance, and quality of 
life. 
A CPAP device is an item of durable 
medical equipment (DME) used in the 
home that typically uses air pressure to 
maintain an open airway and improve 
airflow to the lungs. 
Medicare currently provides national 
coverage of CPAP only for beneficiaries 
whose diagnosis of OSA meets the 
criteria described in the national 
coverage determination at 240.4 of the 
National Coverage Determinations 
(NCD) Manual. We recently published a 
revised NCD that expands coverage of 
CPAP devices to beneficiaries when 
OSA has been diagnosed by specified 
home sleep testing. Prior Medicare 
policy had covered CPAP devices only 
for beneficiaries whose OSA had been 
diagnosed by facility-based attended 
PSG. During the process leading to the 
revised policy, we received many public 
comments expressing concern that 
financial incentives would lead to 
abusive practices that would harm 
Medicare beneficiaries and threaten the 
integrity of the Medicare program. 
These concerns were expressed not only 
with respect to home sleep tests, but 
also those performed in sleep 
laboratories and other facilities. 
Therefore, we are proposing to 
implement a provision that would limit 
potential abusive practices by removing 
a significant financial incentive for 
those practices. 
b. Regulatory proposal 
Based on public comment and prior 
agency experience, we believe that the 
interests of beneficiaries and the 
Medicare program can be harmed if the 
provider of a diagnostic test has a vested 
interest in the outcome of the test itself. 
In the specific context of this proposed 
VerDate Aug<31>2005 18:46 Jul 03, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\07JYP2.SGM 07JYP2sro

38580 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
rule, we believe that the individual or 
entity that directly or indirectly 
administers the sleep test and/or 
provides the sleep test device used to 
administer the sleep test (referred to 
hereinafter as the ‘provider of the sleep 
test’) has a self-interest in the result of 
that test if that provider, or its affiliate, 
is also the supplier of the CPAP device.’’ 
This provides incentive to test more 
frequently or less frequently than is 
medically necessary and to interpret a 
test result with a bias that favors self- 
interest. 
Current medical evidence 
persuasively demonstrates that 
treatment with a CPAP device is safe for 
patients who have OSA. Similar 
evidence is lacking for treatment with a 
CPAP device of persons who do not in 
fact have obstructive sleep apnea. A test 
interpreted with bias or reported falsely 
may mislead the beneficiary’s treating 
physician and divert the beneficiary 
from medically appropriate treatment. 
Moreover, supplying a medically 
unnecessary CPAP device is a waste of 
Medicare trust funds. 
Based on section 1871(a)(1) of the Act, 
which provides the Secretary with the 
authority to ‘‘prescribe such regulations 
as may be necessary to carry out the 
administration of the insurance 
programs under this title,’’ and due to 
our concerns with respect to the 
potential for unnecessary utilization of 
sleep tests, we are proposing to prohibit 
payment to the supplier of the CPAP 
device when such supplier, or its 
affiliate, is directly or indirectly the 
provider of the sleep test that is used to 
diagnose a Medicare beneficiary with 
OSA. 
As alternatives we had considered 
requiring pre-authorization for sleep 
tests or modifying payments for the 
services when they are furnished by the 
same entity but believe these options 
would either generate undue burden on 
both the Medicare beneficiary and the 
claims processing systems or be 
administratively burdensome. 
Therefore, we are proposing to revise 
the durable medical equipment, 
prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies 
(DMEPOS) supplier enrollment 
safeguards set forth at § 424.57 to 
protect the Medicare program and its 
beneficiaries from fraudulent or abusive 
practices that may be related to CPAP 
devices. We are proposing to add new 
definitions to paragraph (a) to define 
‘‘sleep test’’ and ‘‘CPAP device’’ and to 
add a new paragraph (f), which would 
establish a specific payment prohibition 
that would not allow the supplier to 
receive Medicare payment for a CPAP 
device if that supplier, or its affiliate, is 
directly or indirectly the provider of the 
sleep test used to diagnose a beneficiary 
with OSA. 
3. Beneficiary Signature for 
Nonemergency Ambulance Transport 
Services 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘OTHER ISSUES– 
BENEFICIARY SIGNATURE’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period, we created an 
additional exception to the beneficiary 
signature requirements, in 
§ 424.36(b)(6), for emergency ambulance 
transports (72 FR 66406). The exception 
allows ambulance providers and 
suppliers to sign on behalf of the 
beneficiary, at the time of transport, 
provided that certain documentation 
requirements are met. To take advantage 
of the new exception, an ambulance 
provider or supplier must maintain in 
its files: (1) A contemporaneous 
statement, signed by an ambulance 
employee who is present during the 
trip, that the beneficiary was mentally 
or physically incapable of signing (and 
that no other authorized person was 
available or willing to sign); (2) 
documentation as to the date, time and 
place of transport; and (3) either a 
signed contemporaneous statement from 
the receiving facility that documents the 
name of the beneficiary and the date 
and time the beneficiary was received 
by that facility, or a secondary form of 
verification from the facility that is 
received at a later date. 
In the CY 2008 PFS final rule with 
comment period, we clarified that, apart 
from the new exception in 
§ 424.36(b)(6), where a beneficiary is 
unable to sign a claim at the time the 
service is rendered, ambulance 
providers and suppliers are required to 
use reasonable efforts to follow-up with 
the beneficiary and obtain his or her 
signature before submitting the claim 
with a signature from one of the 
individuals or entities specified in 
§ 424.36(b)(1) through (b)(5) (72 FR 
66324). We further clarified that only 
providers of services, and not 
ambulance suppliers, can take 
advantage of § 424.36(b)(5), which states 
that a representative of the provider or 
of the nonparticipating hospital may 
sign on behalf of the beneficiary if the 
provider or nonparticipating hospital 
was unable to have a claim signed in 
accordance with § 424.36(b)(1) through 
(b)(4) (72 FR 66322). 
Subsequent to publication of the CY 
2008 PFS final rule with comment 
period, ambulance provider and 
supplier stakeholders requested that we 
extend the exception in § 424.36(b)(6) to 
nonemergency ambulance transports in 
instances where the beneficiary is 
physically or mentally incapable of 
signing. These stakeholders stated that 
there are many nonemergency 
transports for which a beneficiary is 
physically or mentally incapable of 
signing a claim form. For example, 
stakeholders asserted that beneficiaries 
residing in long term care facilities often 
need to be transported for 
nonemergency medical treatment, yet 
may be incapable of signing the claim 
due to physical or mental ailments, such 
as Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of 
dementia. In these instances, there may 
be no other individual who is 
immediately available and authorized to 
sign the claim as specified in 
§ 424.36(b). 
Because we anticipate that there 
would be little or no increased risk of 
fraud or program abuse in extending the 
exception in § 424.36(b)(6) to include 
nonemergency transports, we are 
proposing to do so through a revision of 
the language in § 424.36(b)(6) to refer 
specifically to nonemergency transports. 
We are also proposing to add language 
to § 424.36(a) to clarify that, apart from 
the use of the exception in 
§ 424.36(b)(6), providers and suppliers 
must make reasonable efforts to obtain 
the beneficiary’s signature before relying 
on one of the exceptions in § 424.36(b). 
We note that § 424.36(b)(5) specifies that 
a provider may not invoke the exception 
to sign a claim on behalf of a beneficiary 
unless it is unable to have one of the 
persons specified in § 424.36(b)(1) 
through (b)(4) sign the claim. Finally, 
given that most claims are submitted 
electronically, we are proposing to 
amend § 424.36(a) to define ‘‘claim’’ for 
purposes of the beneficiary signature 
requirements as the claim form itself or 
a form that contains adequate notice to 
the beneficiary or other authorized 
individual that the purpose of the 
signature is to authorize a provider or 
supplier to submit a claim to Medicare 
for specified services furnished to the 
beneficiary. 
4. Solicitation of Comments and Data 
Pertaining to Physician Organ Retrieval 
Services 
[If you choose to comment on issues

RETRIEVAL’’ at the beginning of your

Since 1987, we have limited the 
amount an OPO may reimburse a

to $1,250 per donor (one or two 
kidneys). Although the payments made 
to physicians for organ retrieval services 
associated with other types of organ 
transplants have increased, kidney 
retrieval rates have remained at $1,250. 
We have received several requests to 
change the amount we pay for kidney 
retrievals. To date, we do not have data 
upon which to base a change in 
payment. 
In order to determine fair and 
reasonable payment for cadaveric organ 
retrieval services, we are soliciting 
public comments and data that are 
reflective of organ retrieval service 
costs. We are not limiting our 
solicitation to costs associated with 
kidney retrieval services, but are 
interested in receiving comments and 
data pertaining to retrieval services for 
all types of organs. We may use this 
information to determine the extent to 
which a recalculation of the payment for 
cadaveric organ retrieval services 
performed by a physician is warranted 
and to inform any future rulemaking on 
this subject. Any future rulemaking 
would provide for notice and public 
comment. 
5. Revision to the ‘‘Appeals of CMS or 
CMS Contractor Determinations When a 
Provider or Supplier Fails to Meet the 
Requirements for Medicare Billing 
Privileges’’ Final Rule 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘OTHER ISSUES—REVISIONS 
TO APPEALS FINAL RULE’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
In the June 27, 2008 Federal Register, 
we published the ‘‘Appeals of CMS or 
CMS Contractor Determinations When a 
Provider or Supplier Fails to Meet the 
Requirements for Medicare Billing 
Privileges’’ final rule. In § 405.874(b)(2), 
we stated, ‘‘The revocation of a 
provider’s or supplier’s billing 
privileges is effective 30 days after CMS 
or the CMS contractor mails notice of its 
determination to the provider or 
supplier. A revocation based on Federal 
exclusion or debarment is effective with 
the date of the exclusion or debarment.’’ 
During the 30 days after CMS or our 
contractor mails a revocation notice to 
a provider or supplier, the provider or 
supplier is afforded the opportunity to 
submit a corrective action plan. A 
corrective action plan gives a provider 
or supplier an opportunity to provide 
evidence that demonstrates that the 
provider or supplier is in compliance 
with Medicare requirements. Moreover, 
a provider or supplier can use a 
corrective action plan to correct the 
deficiency without filing an appeal 
under 42 CFR part 498, and remain in 
the Medicare program when the 
provider demonstrates that the provider 
or supplier is in compliance with 
Medicare requirements and the 
Medicare contractor accepts the 
corrective action plan. In those 
situations where a provider or supplier 
submits an acceptable corrective action 
plan, the provider or supplier maintains 
their billing privileges and the 
revocation determination is not 
implemented. 
We maintain that providers or 
suppliers are able to provide sufficient 
evidence through a corrective action 
plan that demonstrates that they are in 
compliance with Medicare requirements 
when CMS or our contractor imposes a 
revocation based on certain types of 
adverse actions such as a Federal 
exclusion or debarment. Accordingly, 
consistent with revoking billing 
privileges with the date of exclusion or 
debarment, we believe that similarly 
situated revocations such as felony 
convictions and license suspension or 
revocation do not lend themselves to a 
corrective action plan and that the 
revocation should be effective with the 
date of the felony conviction or the 
license suspension or revocation. 
Moreover, we maintain that when CMS 
or our contractor determines that a 
provider or supplier, including a 
DMEPOS supplier, is no longer 
operating at the practice location 
provided to Medicare on a paper or 
electronic Medicare enrollment 
application that the revocation should 
be effective with the date that CMS or 
our contractor determines that the 
provider or supplier is no longer 
operating at the practice location. 
Further, while we do not believe that 
revocations based on felony convictions, 
license suspension or revocation, or a 
revocation based on a provider or a 
supplier no longer being operational at 
a specific practice location, lend 
themselves to a corrective action plan, 
we believe that these providers and 
suppliers should be afforded appeal 
rights in 42 CFR part 498. We believe 
that the appeals process will permit a 
provider or supplier who believes that 
CMS or our contractor has made an 
incorrect decision regarding revocation 
based on Federal exclusion or 
debarment, felony conviction, license 
suspension or revocation, or when we 
have determined that the provider or 
supplier is no longer operating at the 
practice location, the opportunity to 
have CMS or our contractor reconsider 
its initial revocation determination. 
Accordingly, we are proposing to 
revise § 405.874(b)(2) from ‘‘The 
revocation of provider’s or supplier’s 
billing privileges is effective 30 days 
after CMS or the CMS contractor mails 
notice of its determination to the 
provider or supplier. A revocation based 
on Federal exclusion or debarment is 
effective with the date of the exclusion 
or debarment.’’ to ‘‘The revocation of a 
provider’s or supplier’s billing 
privileges is effective 30 days after CMS 
or the CMS contractor mails notice of its 
determination to the provider or 
supplier, except if the revocation is 
based on Federal exclusion or 
debarment, felony conviction, license 
suspension or revocation, or the practice 
location is determined by CMS or its 
contractor not to be operational. When 
a revocation is based on an exclusion or 
debarment, Federal exclusion or 
debarment, felony conviction, license 
suspension or revocation, or the practice 
location is determined by CMS or its 
contractor not to be operational, the 
revocation is effective with the date of 
exclusion or debarment, felony 
conviction, license suspension or 
revocation or the date that CMS or its 
contractor determined that the provider 
or supplier was no longer operational.’’ 
In addition, to ensure consistency, we 
are proposing to revise § 424.535(f) from 
‘‘Revocation becomes effective within 
30 days of the initial revocation 
notification.’’ to ‘‘Revocation becomes 
effective 30 days after CMS or the CMS 
contractor mails notice of its 
determination to the provider or 
supplier, except if the revocation is 
based on Federal exclusion or 
debarment, felony conviction, license 
suspension or revocation, or the practice 
location is determined by CMS or its 
contractor not to be operational. When 
a revocation is based on an exclusion or 
debarment, Federal exclusion or 
debarment, felony conviction, license 
suspension or revocation, or the practice 
location is determined by CMS or its 
contractor not to be operational, the 
revocation is effective with the date of 
exclusion or debarment, felony 
conviction, license suspension or 
revocation or the date that CMS or its 
contractor determined that the provider 
or supplier was no longer operational.’’ 
We believe that these changes will 
ensure that providers and suppliers are 
afforded due process rights under 42 
CFR part 498, but also ensure that 
Medicare is not making or continuing to 
make payments to providers and 
suppliers who are no longer eligible to 
receive payments. 
We are soliciting comments on 
whether we should establish an 
expedited reconsideration process for 
providers and suppliers for when we 
issue a revocation for the following 
reasons: (1) Federal debarment or 
exclusion, (2) felony conviction, (3)

license suspension or revocation, or (4) 
when CMS or our contractor determines 
that the provider is not operational at 
the practice location provided to 
Medicare and the provider or supplier 
furnishes sufficient evidence to 
demonstrate that CMS or our contractor 
made a factual error when issuing the 
initial revocation determination. 
We believe that establishing an 
expedited reconsideration process will 
afford providers and suppliers with an 
administrative remedy similar to a 
corrective action plan, but allow CMS or 
our contractor to establish an effective 
date of revocation on the date of 
notification. In addition, we are 
soliciting comments on whether CMS or 
our contractors should consider 
processing expedited reconsiderations 
within a specified time period such as 
30 days of the date the provider or 
supplier furnishes sufficient evidence to 
make a reconsideration determination. 
III. Potentially Misvalued Services 
Under the Physician Fee Schedule 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘POTENTIALLY MISVALUED 
SERVICES UNDER THE PFS’’ at the 
beginning of your comments.] 
A.Valuing Services Under the Physician 
Fee Schedule 
The American Medical Association’s 
Relative Value System Update 
Committee (RUC) provides 
recommendations to CMS for the 
valuation of new and revised codes, as 
well as codes identified as misvalued 
under the Five-Year Review of Work. 
On an ongoing basis, the RUC’s Practice 
Expense (PE) Subcommittee reviews 
direct PE (clinical staff, medical 
supplies, medical equipment) for 
individual services and examines the 
many broad and methodological issues 
relating to the development of PE RVUs. 
There has been considerable concern 
expressed by the Medicare Payment 
Advisory Commission (MedPAC), the 
Congress, and other stakeholders in 
accurate pricing under the PFS. Despite 
the large increase in work RVUs for 
many medical visits during the last 
Five-Year Review of physician work, 
there continues to be concern that the 
presence of many overvalued 
procedures within the physician fee 
schedule disadvantages primary care 
services and creates distortion in the 
PFS. Critics have stated the relative 
imbalance in the number of codes for 
which the work RVUs are increased 
rather than decreased in the three Five- 
Year Reviews of work RVUs. 
The RUC has created the Five-Year 
Review Identification Workgroup to 
respond to these concerns regarding the 
valuation of codes. The workgroup has 
identified some potentially misvalued 
codes through several vehicles, namely, 
identifying codes with site of service 
anomalies, high intra-service work per 
unit time (IWPUT), and services with 
high volume growth. We plan to address 
the RUC’s recommendations from the 
February and April 2008 meetings for 
codes with site of service anomalies in 
the CY 2009 PFS final rule in a manner 
consistent with the way we address 
other RUC recommendations. Each year 
in the PFS final rule with comment 
period, we describe the RUC’s 
recommendations, state whether or not 
we accept them, and provide a rationale 
for our decision. The values for these 
services will be published as interim 
values for 2009. 
We believe that there are certain steps 
we can take to help address the issue of 
potentially misvalued services. The 
following is a summary of these 
approaches: 
1. Updating High Cost Supplies 
We are proposing to create a process 
to update the prices for high cost supply 
items that are paid under the PE 
methodology. 
The RUC and MedPAC have 
recommended that we establish an 
update process, at least every 5 years, to 
ensure the accuracy and completeness 
of the direct PE inputs. Both 
organizations have suggested that an 
update process for the new, higher- 
priced supply items should occur more 
frequently because prices for these items 
may decrease over time as competition 
increases. The RUC specifically 
requested the review of higher-price 
supply items (over $200) and that the re- 
pricing be carried out on an annual 
basis. In the CY 2006 and CY 2007 PFS 
proposed rule and final rule with 
comment period, we expressed concern 
that submitting more recent and reliable 
documentation for supply prices may be 
burdensome to the physician specialties 
involved. 
Upon further review of this issue and 
examination of the PE database, we 
believe that the burden would be 
minimal and the result would be to 
better ensure that we are paying 
properly for these supplies. Therefore, 
we are proposing a process to update 
high cost supplies every 2 years. We 
would specifically focus on the supplies 
that cost $150 or more of which there 
are currently 65 supplies which are 
listed in Table 24. Every other year we 
would identify supply items in the PE 
database costing over $150 and list these 
supplies in the proposed rule. We 
would request that the specialty 
societies or other relevant organizations 
provide acceptable documentation 
supporting the pricing for the supply 
item during the 60-day comment period. 
Since it may not be necessary to require 
an annual price update for each supply 
item over $150, we are proposing to 
revalue the list of high cost supply items 
on a biennial basis, but are interested in 
receiving comments concerning this 
proposed timeframe. 
Pricing for these higher-priced 
supplies would need to be supported by 
valid, reliable documentation that 
reflects the typical price in the 
marketplace. For the past several years 
in the proposed rule and final rule with 
comment period, we have outlined 
examples of acceptable documentation 
which include a detailed description 
(including system components), 
sources, and current pricing 
information, such as copies of catalog 
pages, hard copies from specific web 
pages, invoices, and quotes from 
manufacturer, vendors or distributors. 
Documentation that does not include 
specific pricing information such as 
phone numbers and addresses of 
manufacturer, vendors or distributors; 
Web site links without pricing 
information would not be acceptable. 
If such acceptable documentation was 
not received within the 60-day comment 
period for the proposed rule, we would 
apply prices that we were able to obtain 
through the use of searches for retail 
pricing on the internet, supply catalogs 
or other sources available to determine 
the appropriate cost. We would use the 
lowest price identified by these sources. 
In future years, we may consider 
initiating additional reviews of supplies 
that cost less than this amount. 
We would also be interested in 
receiving comments on alternatives that 
could be used to update pricing 
information in the absence of 
information provided by the specialty 
societies and organizations.

2. Review of Services Often Billed 
Together and the Possibility of 
Expanding the Multiple Procedure 
Payment Reduction (MPPR) to 
Additional Non-Surgical Procedures 
We have a longstanding policy of 
reducing payment for multiple surgical 
procedures performed on the same 
patient, by the same physician, on the 
same day. The policy is largely based on 
the efficiencies recognized in practice 
expenses for pre- and post-surgical 
services. Originally, payment was made 
in full for the highest priced procedure; 
at 50 percent for the second highest 
price procedure; and at 25 percent for 
the third through fifth procedures. In 
1995, the policy was revised to pay the 
highest priced procedure in full and at 
50 percent for the second through fifth 
procedures (59 FR 32767 through 32768 
and 59 FR 63423 through 63426). 
In 1995, the MPPR policy was also 
extended to six nuclear medicine 
diagnostic procedures performed on the 
same patient on the same day. Payment 
is made in full for the highest priced 
procedure, and at 50 percent for the 
second procedure. Prior to that time, no 
payment was generally made for the 
second procedure. We also indicated 
that we would consider applying the 
multiple procedure policy to other 
diagnostic tests in the future (59 FR 
32769 and 59 FR 63427 through 63428). 
In 2006, the policy was extended to 
certain diagnostic imaging procedures 
performed on contiguous areas of the 
body. In such cases, most clinical labor 
activities and most supplies are not 
performed or furnished twice. The 
payment reduction applies to 100 
procedure codes within 11 families of 
codes. When two or more procedures 
within a family are performed on the 
same patient in a single session, the TC 
of the highest priced procedure is paid 
at 100 percent; the TC of each 
subsequent procedure is paid at 75 
percent. The reduction does not apply 
to the PC (70 FR 45849 through 45851 
and 70 FR 70261 through 70265). 
Some observers have raised concerns 
that there may be inequities between 
specialties in the current coding and 
payment system regarding the extent to 
which there are opportunities for 
additional coding and payment for 
services performed on the same day. 
Physicians in some specialties, such as 
primary care physicians, typically bill 
for their services using evaluation and 
management (E/M) codes that represent 
a fairly broad package of services (that 
include a significant amount of pre- and 
post-service care, including 
coordination of care). Likewise, a 
significant portion of services performed 
by specialties such as general or cardiac 
surgeons are reported and paid through 
comprehensive global surgery policies 
which also include pre- and post-service 
work, reducing the possibilities for 
additional billings. In contrast, many 
other services under the PFS are paid 
for using codes that represent much 
smaller units of service, and in many 
cases the codes and payment amounts 
might represent fairly small portions of 
the total service provided on the same 
day. 
We plan to perform a data analysis of 
non-surgical CPT codes that are often 
billed together (for example, 60 to 70 
percent of the time) to determine if there 
are inequities in PFS payments that are 
a result of variations between services in 
the comprehensiveness of the codes 
used to report the services or in the 
payment policies applied to each (for 
example, global surgery, MPPRs). As 
noted above, clinical labor activities, 
supplies and equipment may not be 
performed or furnished twice when 
multiple procedures are performed. 
We invite comments and suggestions 
from the RUC and others on this 
important issue. As a result of reviewing 
the data and any suggestions we receive 
regarding these concerns, we may 
consider developing proposals to either 
bundle additional services or expand 
the application of the MPPR to 
additional procedures. Any proposed 
changes will be made through 
rulemaking and be subject to public 
comment at a later date. 
B. Requested Approaches for the RUC to 
Utilize 
We have also identified methods that 
we are requesting the RUC undertake to 
assist in identifying potentially 
misvalued services including: (1) 
Review the Fastest Growing Procedure 
Codes; (2) Review Harvard-Valued 
Codes; and (3) Review PE RVUs. 
1. Review the Fastest Growing 
Procedure Codes 
We have identified the fastest growing 
services as measured by growth in 
utilization from CY 2004 through CY 
2007. The codes we identified were the 
following: 
• Those that represent services that 
had three consecutive years of 10 
percent (or more) annual growth in 
allowed services; 
• Excluded if there was less than $1 
million in 2007 allowed charges; and 
• Included if still active in 2008. 
This analysis has resulted in the 
identification of over 100 procedure 
codes, which are shown in Table 25. 
Some of the identified services are new, 
while others have been in the clinical 
arena for a number of years. These codes 
may warrant a reassessment to 
determine why there has been an 
increase in utilization. There may be a 
clinical rationale or there may have 
been changes in the relative resources 
involved with furnishing the service. 
We have requested that the RUC 
immediately begin a review of the 
fastest growing services by examining 
the codes listed in Table 25, Fastest 
Growing Procedure Codes. We will 
work with the RUC on prioritizing the 
review of these codes.

2. Review Harvard-Valued Codes 
Currently, there are approximately 
2900 codes that were originally valued 
using Harvard data and which have not 
subsequently been evaluated by the 
RUC. These codes represent about $5.0 
billion in annual spending under the 
PFS and are still being paid on RVUs 
that were determined almost 20 years 
ago. Reviewing these codes will ensure 
that they are valued based upon the 
most up to date clinical practice and 
that they are not creating inappropriate 
incentives. 
We have requested the RUC to 
undertake an ongoing (multi-year) effort 
to review the Harvard-valued codes that 
have not subsequently been evaluated 
by the RUC. As part of our request, we 
requested that the initial focus be given 
to high-volume, low intensity codes. We 
look forward to receiving the 
recommendations from the RUC. 
3. Review PE RVUs 
Practice expenses represent about 44 
percent of total relative values for 
physicians’ services. Indirect PEs are 
allocated in some measure based on 
direct PE inputs. Thus, ensuring the 
accuracy of direct PE inputs and that 
they are in agreement with the clinical 
aspects specific to each procedure may 
aid in the identification of misvalued 
services. We have requested that the 
RUC continue the review of direct PE 
inputs. We request that the initial focus 
be given to the high-volume codes 
where the PE payments are significantly 
increasing during the transition to the 
new PE methodology. 
We recognize that the work outlined 
here will require significant effort by the 
RUC and specialty societies but believe

38590 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
that this work is necessary to improve 
the PFS. We expect that all reviews and 
changes to RVUs would be conducted in 
tandem with our established regulatory 
process such as the annual review of 
new/revised codes and the Five-Year 
Review. 
IV. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, we are required to provide 60- 
day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information (COI) 
requirement is submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for 
review and approval. In order to fairly 
evaluate whether an information 
collection should be approved by OMB, 
section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 requires that we 
solicit comment on the following issues: 
• The need for the information 
collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
• The accuracy of our estimate of the 
information collection burden. 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected. 
• Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
We are soliciting public comment on 
each of these issues for the following 
sections of this document that contain 
information collection requirements 
(ICRs): 
A. ICRs Regarding Independent 
Diagnostic Testing Facility (§ 410.33) 
Section 410.33(j) states that a 
physician or NPP organization 
furnishing diagnostic testing services, 
except diagnostic mammography 
services, must enroll as an IDTF for each 
practice location furnishing these 
services. The burden associated with 
this requirement is the time and effort 
for a physician group practice or clinic 
to enroll each of the practice locations 
in the Medicare program. To enroll in 
the program, the physician or NPP 
organization must complete a Medicare 
enrollment application, the CMS–855B. 
The burden associated with completing 
and submitting this application is 
currently approved under OMB control 
number 0938–0685 with an expiration 
date of February 28, 2011. 
B. ICRs Regarding Exception to the 
Referral Prohibition Related to 
Compensation Arrangements 
(§ 411.357) 
As discussed in section II.N. of the 
preamble of this proposed rule, 
proposed § 411.357(x) would set forth 
an exception for incentive payment and 
shared savings programs. The programs 
would involve improvement of quality 
of hospital patient care services through 
changes in physician clinical or 
administrative practices or actual cost 
savings for the hospital resulting from 
reduction of waste or changes in 
physician clinical or administrative 
practices, without an adverse affect or 
diminution in quality of hospital patient 
care services. The hospital-administered 
program would be required to have 
performance measures that would be 
individually tracked and monitored 
throughout the term of the arrangement. 
In addition, the program would be 
required to have at least five physicians 
participating in each performance 
measure and the program would be 
required to undergo periodic 
independent medical review (once prior 
to the commencement of the program 
and annually thereafter) for its impact 
(or potential impact) on the quality of 
patient care services provided at the 
hospital. We anticipate that many 
hospitals seeking to create new 
incentive payment or shared savings 
programs would structure those 
arrangements to comply with the 
requirements set forth in § 411.357(x). 
We have no way of knowing for 
certain the number of hospitals that 
currently utilize incentive payment or 
shared savings programs nor the nature 
and/or type of existing programs. 
However, we are aware that the Office 
of the Inspector General has issued 10 
advisory opinions to date approving 
proposed incentive payment or shared 
savings programs from entities. While 
the OIG opinions were limited to 
specific arrangements, they did not 
afford providers any protection from the 
physician self-referral regulations. 
Based on information furnished by one 
private industry consulting firm, we are 
aware of approximately 50 incentive 
payment, shared savings or related 
programs currently in operation. We 
have also received anecdotal 
information from industry stakeholders 
that the number of programs in 
operation may be as high as 100. 
Therefore, we estimate that there are 
approximately 75 incentive payment, 
shared savings or similar programs 
currently in operation. 
We believe that this proposed 
exception, if finalized, would result in 
an increase in the number of hospitals 
that would create these types of 
programs. We clarify that this collection 
of information burden would pertain to 
hospitals seeking to develop or modify 
incentive payment or shared savings 
programs. For purposes of this 
requirement, we are estimating that 150 
hospitals would avail themselves of this 
proposed exception. 
Proposed § 411.357(x)(1) and (2) 
specifies the elements that would be 
required in an incentive payment or 
shared savings program, including the 
determination of performance measures, 
and target measures to be achieved 
under the program. In addition, 
proposed § 411.357(x)(11) would require 
that payments made to a physician must 
not be based on patient care quality 
improvements or cost savings that were 
achieved during a prior period of the 
arrangement. To the extent that a 
hospital elected to distribute payments 
to physicians more frequently than the 
term of the agreement (for example, a 3- 
year arrangement that provides payment 
on an annual basis), these payments 
would be required to take into account 
previous payments made for 
performance measures already achieved. 
We believe that the burden associated 
with the provisions listed in 
§ 411.357(x)(1) through (2) and 
§ 411.357(x)(11) would involve the time 
and effort each hospital would put forth 
into creating its program, and would 
vary greatly, depending upon the 
performance measures (clinical or 
administrative practices), size of the 
program, the number of physicians or 
other medical staff participating in the 
creation of the program, and the 
methods used for physician payment. 
We estimate 100 burden hours for the 
development of each incentive payment 
or shared savings program including, 
but not limited to, the professional 
services of the following individuals; 
attorneys, medical directors, 
accountants, and database 
administrators. The total burden 
associated with this requirement would 
be 150 hospitals × 100 hours = 15,000 
burden hours. 
Proposed § 411.357(x)(5) would 
require independent medical review of 
a hospital’s incentive payment or shared 
savings program’s impact on the quality 
of patient care services provided at the 
hospital. In addition, corrective action 
would be required in instances where 
the independent medical review 
indicates a diminution in the quality of 
patient care services. The review would 
be required to take place prior to 
commencement of the program and at 
least annually thereafter. The burden 
associated with the requirements in 
proposed § 411.357(x)(5) would be the 
time and effort necessary for a hospital 
to obtain, both prior to and during the 
term of the program, a written 
independent medical review of the 
program and follow up on any 
recommended corrective action. We 
believe it would take 20 hours for each

hospital to initially obtain independent 
expert medical review. Thereafter, the 
independent medical review that would 
be required to be conducted periodically 
is estimated to impose a burden on the 
hospital of 10 hours. The total burden 
associated with this requirement would 
be 150 hospitals × 20 hours for the first 
year of a program and 150 hospitals × 
10 hours annually thereafter = 4500 
hours, assuming hospitals, on average, 
implement a 2-year incentive payment 
or shared savings program. 
Proposed § 411.357(x)(7) would 
require hospitals to provide written 
disclosure to patients affected by the 
program regarding the program and the 
physician’s participation in the 
program. The burden associated with 
this requirement would be time and 
effort necessary for the hospital to 
provide disclosure in writing to patients 
that would be affected by the program. 
We believe that it would take each 
hospital 1 hour to draft a standard 
disclosure. In addition, we believe it 
would take each hospital 1 minute to 
provide the written disclosure to 
potentially all patients. Based on 
anecdotal accounts of the number of 
patients involved historical gainsharing 
programs, we estimate that each 
hospital would need to provide 
standard disclosure to approximately 
5,000 patients. However, we recognize 
that hospital size and patient volume 
will vary significantly from program to 
program. The total burden associated 
with this requirement would be 150 
hospitals × 1 hour = 150 hours to draft 
a standard disclosure. We estimate the 
burden of providing the disclosure to 
patients to be (150 hospitals × (1 
minute/60 minutes/hour) × 5,000 
patients) = 12,500 hours. The total 
burden associated with the 
requirements contained in 
§ 411.357(x)(7) is 12,650 hours. 
Section 411.357(x)(8) would require 
that the incentive payment or shared 
savings program arrangements be set out 
in writing, signed by the parties, and 
specify the basis for the remuneration. 
Each specific performance measure and 
the resulting payment (or formula for 
payment) must also be clearly and 
separately identified. In addition, 
§ 411.357(x)(15) would require that the 
hospital maintain accurate and 
contemporaneous documentation of the 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program and make documentation 
available to the Secretary upon request. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements listed in § 411.357(x)(8) 
through (10) and § 411.357(x)(15) would 
be the time and effort necessary to draft 
an arrangement with the 
aforementioned information. While 
these requirements are subject to the 
PRA, we believe the burden associated 
with drafting and maintaining written 
arrangements detailing conditions of 
remuneration would be part of usual 
and customary business practices and 
thereby exempt from the PRA under 5 
CFR 1320.3(b)(2). 
C. ICRs Regarding Dispute Resolution 
and Process for Suspension or 
Termination of Approved CAP Contract 
and Termination or Physician 
Participation Under Exigent 
Circumstances (§ 414.917). 
Section 414.917(b)(4) states that an 
approved CAP vendor may appeal a 
termination by requesting a 
reconsideration. The burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary to submit a 
reconsideration request to CMS. While 
this requirement is subject to the PRA, 
the associated burden is exempt under 
5 CFR 1320.4(a)(2). Information 
collected as part of an administrative 
action is not subject to the PRA. 
D. ICRs Regarding Additional Provider 
and Supplier Requirements for Enrolling 
and Maintaining Active Enrollment 
Status in the Medicare Program 
(§ 424.516). 
Section 424.516(d) discusses the 
reporting requirements for physician 
groups/organizations, physicians and 
NPPs. Specifically, the aforementioned 
providers must report to CMS, within 30 
days the information listed in 
§ 424.516(d)(1). Additionally, all other 
changes in enrollment must be reported 
within 90 days. 
Section 424.516(e) addresses the 
reporting requirements for all other 
providers and suppliers. Providers not 
mentioned in § 424.516(a) through (d) 
must report to CMS, within 30 days, 
changes of ownership, including 
changes in authorized official(s) or 
delegated official(s). All other changes 
in enrollment must be reported within 
90 days. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements contained in § 424.516(d) 
through (e) is the time and effort 
necessary to report the applicable 
information to CMS. While this 
requirement is subject to the PRA, we 
have no way to accurately quantify the 
number of submissions. Each 
submission will be reviewed on a case- 
by-case basis. 
Section § 424.516(d) states providers 
or suppliers are required to maintain 
ordering and referring documentation, 
including the NPI, received from a 
physician or eligible NPP for 10 years 
from the date of service. Physicians and 
NPPs are required to maintain written 
ordering and referring documentation 
for 10 years from the date of service. 
The burden associated with these 
recordkeeping requirements is the time 
and effort associated with maintaining 
the aforementioned documentation for 
10 years. While these requirements are 
subject to the PRA, we believe the 
burden is exempt because the 
requirement is part of a usual and 
customary business practice. As stated 
in 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2), the time, effort, 
and financial resources necessary to 
comply with a COI that would be 
incurred by persons in the normal 
course of their activities (for example, in 
compiling and maintaining business 
records) is not subject to the PRA.

38592 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
This proposed rule imposes COI 
requirements as outlined in the 
regulation text and specified above. 
However, this proposed rule also makes 
reference to several associated 
information collections that are not 
discussed in the regulation text. The 
following is a discussion of these 
collections, which have already 
received OMB approval. 
Part B Drug Payment 
Section II.F.1 of the preamble of this 
proposed rule discusses payment for 
Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals 
under the ASP methodology. Drug 
manufacturers are required to submit 
ASP data to us on a quarterly basis. The 
collection of ASP data imposes a 
reporting requirement on the public. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort 
required by manufacturers of Medicare 
Part B drugs and biologicals to calculate, 
record, and submit the required data to 
CMS. While the burden associated with 
this requirement is subject to the PRA, 
it is currently approved under OMB 
control number 0938–0921, with an 
expiration date of May 31, 2009. 
Competitive Acquisition Program (CAP) 
Section II.F.2. of this proposed rule 
discusses the Part B CAP issues. While 
we are not imposing any new burden, it 
should be noted that all of the 
information collection components of 
the CAP have been reviewed and 
approved by OMB. They are approved 
under OMB control numbers, 0938– 
0987, 0938–0955, and 0938–0954 with 
expiration dates of April 30, 2009, 
August 31, 2009, and July 31, 2008, 
respectively. 
Physician Quality Reporting Initiative 
Section II.O. of the preamble 
discusses the background of the 
reporting initiative and provides 
information about the measures 
available to eligible professionals who 
choose to participate in PQRI. Section 
1848(k)(1) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to implement a system for the 
reporting by eligible professionals of 
data on quality measures. 
As stated in section II.O.1, eligible 
professionals include physicians, other 
practitioners as described in section 
1842(b)(18)(c) of the Act, physical and 
occupational therapists, and qualified 
speech-language pathologists. This is a 
voluntary reporting initiative. Eligible 
professionals may choose whether to 
participate and satisfactorily submit 
data on quality measures for covered 
professional services. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements of this voluntary reporting 
initiative is the time and effort 
associated with eligible professionals 
identifying applicable PQRI quality 
measures for which they can report the 
necessary information. 
In addition, for claims-based 
reporting, eligible professionals must 
gather the required information, select 
the appropriate quality data codes, and 
include the appropriate quality data 
codes on the claims they submit for 
payment. The PQRI will collect quality- 
data codes as additional (optional) line 
items on the existing HIPAA transaction 
837–P and/or CMS Form 1500. We do 
not anticipate any new forms and no 
modifications to the existing transaction 
or form. We also do not anticipate 
changes to the 837–P or CMS Form 1500 
for CY 2009. 
Because this is a voluntary program, 
it is impossible to estimate with any 
degree of accuracy how many eligible 
professionals will opt to participate in 
the PQRI in CY 2009. Moreover, the 
time needed for an eligible professional 
to review the quality measures and 
other information, select measures 
applicable to his or her patients and the 
services he or she furnishes to them, 
and incorporate the use of quality data 
codes into the office work flows is 
expected to vary along with the number 
of measures that are potentially 
applicable to a given professional’s 
practice. 
We estimate that the additional time 
required to put quality data codes on 
each claim is not a material increment 
to the time required to code the claim 
for payment. The total estimated annual 
burden for this requirement will also 
vary along with the volume of claims on 
which quality data is reported. 
For registry-based reporting, there 
would be no additional burden for 
eligible professionals to report data to a 
registry as eligible professionals are not 
required to report data to registries to 
participate in the PQRI and more than 
likely would already be reporting data 
to the registry. Little, if any, additional 
data would need to be reported to the 
registry for purposes of participation in 
the 2009 PQRI. However, eligible 
professionals would need to authorize 
or instruct the registry to submit quality 
measures results and numerator and 
denominator data on quality measures 
to CMS on their behalf. We estimate that 
the time and effort associated with this 
would be approximately 5 minutes for 
each eligible professional that wishes to 
authorize or instruct the registry to 
submit quality measures results and 
numerator and denominator data on 
quality measures to CMS on their 
behalf. 
Similarly, registries are not required 
to participate in this voluntary 
initiative. Registries interested in 
submitting quality measures results and 
numerator and denominator data on 
quality measures to CMS on their 
participants’ behalf would need to 
complete a self-nomination process in 
order to be considered ‘‘qualified’’ to 
submit on behalf of eligible 
professionals. 
The burden associated with the 
registry-based submission requirements 
of this voluntary reporting initiative is 
the time and effort associated with the 
registry calculating quality measure 
results from the data submitted to the 
registry by its participants and 
submitting the quality measures results 
and numerator and denominator data on 
quality measures to CMS on behalf of 
their participants. The time needed for 
a registry to review the quality measures 
and other information, calculate the 
measures results, and submit the 
measures results and numerator and 
denominator data on the quality 
measures on their participants behalf is 
expected to vary along with the number 
of eligible professionals reporting data 
to the registry and the number of 
applicable measures. However, we 
believe that registries already perform 
many of these activities for their 
participants. The number of measures 
that the registry intends to report to 
CMS and how similar the registry’s 
measures are to CMS’ PQRI measures 
will determine the time burden to the 
registry. 
For EHR-based submission, the 
eligible professional must review the 
quality measures on which we will be 
accepting PQRI data extracted from 
EHRs, select the appropriate quality 
measures, extract the necessary clinical 
data from his or her EHR, and submit 
the necessary data to the CMS- 
designated clinical warehouse. Because 
this manner of reporting quality data to 
CMS is new to PQRI for 2009 and 
participation in this reporting initiative 
is voluntary, it is impossible to estimate 
with any degree of accuracy how many 
eligible professionals will opt to 
participate in the PQRI through the EHR 
mechanism in CY 2009. Similar to the 
burden associated with claims-based 
reporting of quality data, the time 
needed for an eligible professional to 
review the quality measures and other 
information, select measures applicable 
to his or her patients and the services he 
or she furnishes to them, is expected to 
vary along with the number of measures 
that are potentially applicable to a given 
professional’s practice. Once the EHR is 
programmed by the vendor to allow data

V. Response to Comments 
Because of the large number of public 
comments we normally receive on 
Federal Register documents, we are not 
able to acknowledge or respond to them 
individually. We will consider all 
comments we receive by the date and 
time specified in the DATES section of 
this preamble, and, when we proceed 
with a subsequent document, we will 
respond to the comments in the 
preamble to that document. 
VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
[If you choose to comment on issues 
in this section, please include the 
caption ‘‘IMPACT’’ at the beginning of 
your comments.] 
We have examined the impact of this 
rule as required by Executive Order 
12866 on regulatory planning and 
review (September 30, 1993, as further 
amended), the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (RFA) (September 19, 1980 Pub. L. 
96–354), section 1102(b) of the Social 
Security Act, section 202 of the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(March 22, 1995; Pub. L. 104–4), 
Executive Order 13132 on Federalism 
(August 4, 1999), and the Congressional 
Review Act (5 U.S.C. 804(2)). 
Executive Order 12866 (as amended 
by Executive Order 13258 and 13422), 
directs agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). A regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA) must be prepared for major rules 
with economically significant effects 
($100 million or more in any one year). 
As indicated in more detail below in 
this regulatory impact analysis, we 
estimate that the PFS provisions 
included in this proposed rule will 
redistribute more than $100 million in 
1 year. We estimate that this rulemaking 
is ‘‘economically significant’’ as 
measured by the $100 million threshold, 
and hence also a major rule under the 
Congressional Review Act. Accordingly, 
we have prepared a RIA that to the best 
of our ability presents the costs and 
benefits of the rulemaking. 
The RFA requires agencies to analyze 
options for regulatory relief of small 
businesses and other small entities, if a 
rule has a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. For 
purposes of the RFA, we estimate that 
most hospitals and most other providers 
are small entities as that term is used in 
the RFA (including small businesses, 
nonprofit organizations, and small 
governmental jurisdictions). Most 
hospitals and most other providers and 
suppliers are small entities, either by 
nonprofit status or by having revenues 
of $6.5 million to $31.5 million in any 
1 year (for further information, see the 
Small Business Administration’s 
regulation at 70 FR 72577, December 6, 
2005.) Individuals and States are not 
included in the definition of a small 
entity. The RFA requires that we 
analyze regulatory options for small 
businesses and other entities. We 
prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis 
unless we certify that a rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
The analysis must include a justification 
concerning the reason action is being 
taken, the kinds and number of small 
entities the rule affects, and an 
explanation of any meaningful options 
that achieve the objectives with less 
significant adverse economic impact on 
the small entities. 
For purposes of the RFA, physicians, 
NPPs, and suppliers including IDTFs 
are considered small businesses if they 
generate revenues of $6.5 million or 
less. Approximately 95 percent of 
physicians are considered to be small 
entities. There are about 980,000 
physicians, other practitioners, and 
medical suppliers that receive Medicare 
payment under the PFS. 
The CAP provides alternatives to 
physicians who do not wish to purchase 
drugs directly or collect coinsurance. 
The impact of the CAP provisions on an 
individual physician is dependent on 
whether the drugs they provide to 
Medicare beneficiaries are included in 
the list of CAP drugs and whether the 
physician chooses to obtain drugs 
administered to Medicare beneficiaries 
through the CAP. The proposed CAP 
provisions in this proposed rule will 
also have a potential impact on entities 
that are involved in the dispensing or 
distribution of drugs, plan to become 
approved CAP vendors, or are approved 
CAP vendors. 
For purposes of the RFA, 
approximately 80 percent of clinical 
diagnostic laboratories are considered 
small businesses according to the Small 
Business Administration’s size 
standards. These are posted on the 
following Web site: http://sba.gov/idc/ 
groups/public/documents/ 
sba_homepage/serv_sstd_tablepdf.pdf . 
In addition, most ESRD facilities are 
considered small entities for purposes of 
the RFA, either based on nonprofit 
status or by having revenues of $6.5 
million to $31.5 million or less in any 
year. We consider a substantial number 
of entities to be affected if the proposed 
rule is estimated to impact more than 5 
percent of the total number of small 
entities. Based on our analysis of the 
926 nonprofit ESRD facilities 
considered small entities in accordance 
with the above definitions, we estimate 
that the combined impact of the 
proposed changes to payment for renal 
dialysis services included in this 
proposed rule would have a 0.2 percent 
increase in overall payments relative to 
current overall payments. The majority 
of small entities would experience 
impacts of less than 3 percent of total 
revenues. We note that although the 
overall effect of the wage index changes 
is budget neutral, there are increases 
and decreases based on the location of 
individual facilities. The analysis and 
discussion provided in this section, as 
well as elsewhere in this proposed rule, 
complies with the RFA requirements. 
For the e-prescribing provisions, 
physician practices and independent 
pharmacies are considered small 
entities. 
Because we acknowledge that many of 
the affected entities are small entities, 
the analysis discussed throughout the 
preamble of this proposed rule 
constitutes our initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis for the remaining 
provisions. Therefore, we are soliciting 
comments on our estimates and analysis 
of the impact of this proposed rule on 
those small entities. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires us 
to prepare a regulatory impact analysis 
if a rule may have a significant impact 
on the operations of a substantial 
number of small rural hospitals. This 
analysis must conform to the provisions 
of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes 
of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define 
a small rural hospital as a hospital that 
is located outside a metropolitan 
statistical area and has fewer than 100 
beds. We have determined that this 
proposed rule would have minimal 
impact on small hospitals located in 
rural areas. Of the 196 hospital-based

ESRD facilities located in rural areas, 
only 40 are affiliated with hospitals 
with fewer than 100 beds. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
also requires that agencies assess 
anticipated costs and benefits before 
issuing any rule whose mandates 
require spending in any 1 year of $100 
million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation. In 2008, that 
threshold is approximately $130 
million. This proposed rule will not 
mandate any requirements for State, 
local, or tribal governments. Medicare 
beneficiaries are considered to be part of 
the private sector for this purpose. A 
discussion concerning the impact of this 
rule on beneficiaries is found later in 
this section. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule (and subsequent final 
rule) that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
The e-prescribing portions of this 
proposed rule present a potential 
Federalism implication. No State 
categorically bars e-prescribing, but the 
scope and substance of State laws varies 
widely among the States. In recent 
years, many States have more actively 
legislated in this area. Should a State 
law be contrary to the Part D e- 
prescribing standards, or should it 
restrict the ability to carry out the 
Medicare Part D e-prescribing program, 
the MMA provides for preemption of 
that State law at section 1860D–4(e)(5) 
of the Act. It provides: 
(5) Relation to State Laws. The standards 
promulgated under the subsection shall 
supersede any State law or regulation that— 
(A) Is contrary to the standards or restricts 
the ability to carry out this part; and 
(B) Pertains to the electronic transmission 
of medication history and of information on 
eligibility, benefits, and prescriptions with 
respect to covered part D drugs under this 
part. 
For the reasons given above, we have 
determined that States would not incur 
any direct costs as a result of this 
proposed rule. However, as mandated 
by section 1860D–4(e) of the Act, and 
under Executive Order 13132, we are 
required to minimize the extent of 
preemption, consistent with achieving 
the objectives of the Federal statute, and 
to meet certain other conditions. We 
believe that, taken as a whole, this 
proposed rule would meet these 
requirements. 
We have prepared the following 
analysis, which, together with the 
information provided in the rest of this 
preamble, meets all assessment 
requirements. The analysis explains the 
rationale for and purposes of this 
proposed rule; details the costs and 
benefits of the rule; analyzes 
alternatives; and presents the measures 
we propose to use to minimize the 
burden on small entities. As indicated 
elsewhere in this proposed rule, we 
propose a variety of changes to our 
regulations, payments, or payment 
policies to ensure that our payment 
systems reflect changes in medical 
practice and the relative value of 
services. We provide information for 
each of the policy changes in the 
relevant sections of this proposed rule. 
We are unaware of any relevant Federal 
rules that duplicate, overlap or conflict 
with this proposed rule. The relevant 
sections of this proposed rule contain a 
description of significant alternatives if 
applicable. 
A. RVU Impacts 
1. Resource-Based Work and PE RVUs 
Section 1848(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act 
requires that increases or decreases in 
RVUs may not cause the amount of 
expenditures for the year to differ by 
more than $20 million from what 
expenditures would have been in the 
absence of these changes. If this 
threshold is exceeded, we make 
adjustments to preserve budget 
neutrality (BN). In the CY 2007 PFS 
final rule with comment period, the $4 
billion impact of changes in work RVUs 
resulting from the 5-Year Review 
required that a BN adjustment be made. 
As stated in the CY 2007 PFS final 
rule with comment period, the work 
adjustor for 2008, was approximately 
0.8806. Since there are no additional 
work RVU changes associated with the 
5-Year Review of work RVUs, the work 
adjustor will remain at 0.8806. Table 27 
shows the specialty-level impact of the 
work and PE RVU changes. This rule 
proposes the PE RVUs for CY 2009 
which is the third year of a four-year 
transition to fully implemented resource 
based PE RVUs. There are no changes in 
work RVUs proposed in this rule. The 
process for changes in work RVUs is to 
publish these changes as interim final in 
the final rule with comment published 
later in the year. 
Our estimates of changes in Medicare 
revenues for PFS services compare 
payment rates for CY 2008 with 
proposed payment rates for CY 2009 
using CY 2007 Medicare utilization for 
all years. We are using CY 2007 
Medicare claims processed and paid 
through March 30, 2008, that we 
estimate are 98 percent complete. To the 
extent that there are year-to-year 
changes in the volume and mix of 
services provided by physicians, the 
actual impact on total Medicare 
revenues will be different than those 
shown in Table 27. The payment 
impacts reflect averages for each 
specialty based on Medicare utilization. 
The payment impact for an individual 
physician would be different from the 
average, based on the mix of services the 
physician provides. The average change 
in total revenues would be less than the 
impact displayed here because 
physicians furnish services to both 
Medicare and non-Medicare patients 
and specialties may receive substantial 
Medicare revenues for services that are 
not paid under the PFS. For instance, 
independent laboratories receive 
approximately 80 percent of their 
Medicare revenues from clinical 
laboratory services that are not paid 
under the PFS. 
Table 27 shows only the payment 
impact on PFS services. The following 
is an explanation of the information 
presented in Table 27. 
• Specialty: The physician specialty 
or type of practitioner/supplier. 
• Allowed Charges: Allowed charges 
are the Medicare Fee Schedule amounts 
for covered services and include 
coinsurance and deductibles (which are 
the financial responsibility of the 
beneficiary). These amounts have been 
summed across all services provided by 
physicians, practitioners, or suppliers 
within a specialty to arrive at the total 
allowed charges for the specialty. 
• Impact of PE RVU changes. The 
impact is shown for both 2009, which 
is the third year of the 4-year transition 
using the new methodology, and the 
fully implemented 2010 PE RVUs.

2. Adjustments for Payments for 
Imaging Services 
Section 5102 of the Deficit Reduction 
Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109–171) (DRA) 
exempts the estimated savings from the 
application of the OPPS-based payment 
limitation on the TC for PFS imaging 
services from the PFS BN requirement. 
We estimate that the combined impact 
of the current BN exemptions instituted 
by section 5102 of the DRA, the 
proposed addition of 10 services and the 
removal of 1 deleted service from the 
list of services subject to the MPPR for 
diagnostic imaging services, and the 
proposed payment revisions to OPPS 
payment amounts (which serve as a cap 
on the TCs under the PFS) would result 
in no measurable changes in the 
specialty specific impacts for 2009. In 
addition, while the MPPR was 
implemented administratively, section 
5102 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 
2005 subsequently provided for the 
exemption of reduced expenditures 
resulting from this policy from the 
statutory BN requirement. We would

additional 10 services proposed to be 
added and the 1 service proposed to be 
removed from the list of services subject

Table 28 shows the specialty-level 
impact of the proposed work and PE 
RVU changes, and our most recent 
estimate (¥5.4 percent) of the CY 2009 
Medicare PFS update. 
As indicated in Table 28, our 
estimates of changes in Medicare 
revenues for PFS services compare 
payment rates for CY 2008 with 
proposed payment rates for CY 2009 
using CY 2007 Medicare utilization 
crosswalked to 2008 services. To the 
extent that there are year-to-year 
changes in the volume and mix of 
services provided by physicians, the 
actual impact on total Medicare 
revenues will be different than those 
shown in Table 28. The payment 
impacts reflect averages for each 
specialty based on Medicare utilization. 
The payment impact for an individual 
physician would be different from the 
average, based on the mix of services the 
physician provides. 
Table 28 shows only the payment 
impact on PFS services. The following 
is an explanation of the information 
represented in Table 28. 
• Specialty: The physician specialty 
or type of practitioner/supplier. 
• Allowed Charges: Allowed charges 
are the Medicare Fee Schedule amounts 
for covered services and include 
copayments and deductibles (which are 
the financial responsibility of the 
beneficiary). These amounts have been 
summed across all services provided by 
physicians, practitioners, or suppliers 
with a specialty to arrive at the total 
allowed charges for the specialty. 
• Impact of the 2009 Work RVU 
(including the proposed addition of 10 
services and deletion of 1 service from 
the list of services subject to the 
multiple procedure payment reduction 
for diagnostic imaging services)and PE 
RVU proposed changes using the 
methodology finalized in the CY 2007 
PFS final rule with comment period and 
the revised data sources discussed in 
this proposed rule. 
• CY 2009 Update: The percentage 
decrease in allowed charges attributed 
to the estimated CY 2009 PFS 
conversion factor update (¥5.4 
percent). 
• Combined impact with CY 2009 
update: The CY 2009 percentage 
decrease in allowed charges attributed 
to the impact of the work and PE RVU 
changes and the CY 2009 update.

*PE changes are CY 2009 third year transition changes. For fully implemented CY 2010 PE changes see Table 27. 
**Under current law, the payment rates will decrease by ¥10.6 on July 1, 2008, in addition to the ¥5.4 CY 2009 update. 
***Components may not sum to total due to rounding. Impacts as of May 20, 2008. 
Table 29 shows the estimated impact 
on total payments for selected high-

1 CPT codes and descriptions are copyright 2008 American Medical Association. All Rights Reserved. Applicable FARS/DFARS apply. 
2 Based on CF of 34.0682 published in the CY 2008 PFS Final rule with comment period (72 FR 66222). Used for PFS payment for services 
beginning July 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008. 
3 Based upon proposed ¥5.4 percent reduction in Conversion Factor. 
B. Telehealth 
In section II.D. of this proposed rule, 
we are proposing to create HCPCS codes 
specific to the telehealth delivery of 
follow up inpatient consultations. The 
new HCPCS codes will be limited to the 
range of services included in the scope 
of deleted CPT codes previously 
approved for telehealth, with the 
descriptions modified to limit the use of 
such services for telehealth. Utilization 
of these codes would allow us to 
provide payment for follow-up inpatient 
telehealth consultations, as well as 
enable us to monitor whether the codes 
are used appropriately. 
The total annual Medicare payment 
amount for telehealth services 
(including the originating site facility 
fee) is approximately $2 million. 
Previous additions to the list of 
Medicare telehealth services have not 
resulted in a significant increase in 
Medicare program expenditures. While 
we believe that the addition of follow- 
up inpatient telehealth consultation 
services to the approved telehealth 
service list will enable more 
beneficiaries to access to these services, 
we do not anticipate that this proposed 
change will have a significant budgetary 
impact on the Medicare program. 
C. Payment for Covered Outpatient 
Drugs and Biologicals 
1. ASP Issues 
The proposed changes discussed in 
section II.F.1. of this proposed rule with 
respect to payment for covered 
outpatient drugs and biologicals, are 
estimated to have no impact on 
Medicare expenditures. 
2. CAP Issues 
This proposed rule contains proposals 
and seeks comment on certain aspects of 
the CAP, specifically the annual CAP 
payment amount update mechanism, 
the definition of a CAP physician, 
easing the restriction on physician 
transport of CAP drugs between practice 
locations, and the dispute resolution 
process. Several of these minor 
refinements may improve compliance, 
promote program flexibility, improve 
the quality and potentially the number 
of services for participating CAP 
physicians, and increase available 
choices for participating CAP 
physicians. We anticipate that these 
changes associated with the CAP will 
not result in significant additional cost 
savings or increases relative to the ASP 
payment system. 
D. Application of the HPSA Bonus 
Payment 
As discussed in section II.G. of this 
proposed rule, there are no program cost 
savings or increased expenditures 
associated with this change; however, 
we expect that the regulation will 
increase the number of physicians who 
receive the bonus automatically, while 
decreasing the number of physicians 
required to use modifier in order to 
receive the payment. It will also provide 
assurance to physicians and eligible 
recipients, for example health care 
facilities that bill under the CAH II 
method, in qualified areas that they will

F. Provisions Related to Payment for 
Renal Dialysis Services Furnished by 
End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) 
Facilities 
The ESRD-related provisions in this 
proposed rule are discussed in section 
II.H. of this proposed rule. To 
understand the impact of the proposed 
changes affecting payments to different 
categories of ESRD facilities, it is 
necessary to compare estimated 
payments under the current year (CY 
2008 payments) to estimated payments 
under the revisions to the composite 
rate payment system (CY 2009 
payments) as discussed in section II.H. 
of this proposed rule. To estimate the 
impact among various classes of ESRD 
facilities, it is imperative that the 
estimates of current payments and 
proposed payments contain similar 
inputs. Therefore, we simulated 
payments only for those ESRD facilities 
that we are able to calculate both 
current 2008 payments and proposed 
2009 payments. 
ESRD providers were grouped into the 
categories based on characteristics 
provided in the Online Survey and 
Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) 
file and the most recent cost report data 
from the Healthcare Cost Report 
Information System (HCRIS). We also 
used the December 2007 update of CY 
2007 National Claims History file as a 
basis for Medicare dialysis treatments 
and separately billable drugs and 
biologicals. While the December 2007 
update of the 2007 claims is not 
complete, we wanted to use the most 
recent data available, and plan to use an 
updated version of the 2007 claims file 
for the final rule. Due to data 
limitations, we are unable to estimate 
current and proposed payments for 80 
of the 4866 ESRD facilities that bill for 
ESRD dialysis treatments. 
Table 30 shows the impact of this 
year’s proposed changes to CY 2009 
payments to hospital-based and 
independent ESRD facilities. The first 
column of Table 30 identifies the type 
of ESRD provider, the second column 
indicates the number of ESRD facilities 
for each type, and the third column 
indicates the number of dialysis 
treatments. 
The fourth column shows the effect of 
the proposed change to the wage index 
floor as it affects the composite rate 
payments to ESRD facilities for CY 
2009. The fourth column compares 
aggregate ESRD wage adjusted 
composite rate payments in the fourth 
year of the transition (CY 2009) using 
the CY 2009 wage index with a 0.75 
floor compared to aggregate ESRD wage 
adjusted composite rate payments in the 
fourth year of the transition (CY 2009) 
using the CY 2009 wage index with a 
0.70 floor. Note that the fourth column 
only includes the effect of the proposed 
change to the wage index floor and does 
not include the effects of other wage 
index changes, such as, moving from the 
third to fourth year of the transition and 
updated wage index values from CY 
2008 to CY 2009. 
The fifth column shows the effect of 
all proposed changes to the ESRD wage 
index for CY 2009 as it affects the 
composite rate payments to ESRD 
facilities. It is inclusive of the changes 
in the fourth column. The fifth column 
compares aggregate ESRD wage adjusted 
composite rate payments in the fourth 
year of the transition (CY 2009) to 
aggregate ESRD wage adjusted 
composite rate payments in the third 
year of the transition (CY 2008). In the 
fourth year of the transition (CY 2009), 
ESRD facilities receive 100 percent of 
the CBSA wage adjusted composite rate 
and 0 percent of the MSA wage adjusted 
composite rate. In the third year of the 
transition, ESRD facilities receive 75 
percent of the CBSA wage adjusted 
composite rate and 25 percent of the 
MSA wage adjusted composite rate. The 
overall effect to all ESRD providers in 
aggregate is zero because the proposed 
CY 2009 ESRD wage index has been 
multiplied by a BN adjustment factor to 
comply with the statutory requirement 
that any wage index revisions be done 
in a manner that results in the same 
aggregate amount of expenditures as 
would have been made without any 
changes in the wage index. 
The sixth column shows the overall 
effect of the proposed changes in 
composite rate payments to ESRD 
providers. The overall effect is 
measured as the difference between the 
proposed CY 2009 payment with all 
changes as proposed in this rule and 
current CY 2008 payment. This payment 
amount is computed by multiplying the 
wage adjusted composite rate with the 
drug add-on for each provider times the 
number of dialysis treatments from the 
CY 2007 claims. The CY 2009 proposed 
payment is the transition year 4 wage- 
adjusted composite rate for each 
provider (with the 15.5 percent drug 
add-on) times dialysis treatments from 
CY 2007 claims. The CY 2008 current 
payment is the transition year 3 wage- 
adjusted composite rate for each 
provider (with the current 15.5 percent 
drug add-on) times dialysis treatments 
from CY 2007 claims. 
The overall impact to ESRD providers 
in aggregate is 0.0 percent. This zero 
update corresponds to the proposed 0.0 
percent update to the drug add-on. The 
variation shown in column 6 is due to 
variation in changes in the wage index 
(column 5). All provider types receive 
the same 0.0 percent increase to the 
drug add-on.

puted using the CY2009 wage index with a 0.75 floor are compared to composite rate payments using the CY2009 wage index with a 0.70 floor. 
2 This column shows the overall effect of wage index changes on ESRD providers. Composite rate payments computed using the current wage 
index are compared to composite rate payments using the CY2009 wage index changes. 
3 This column shows the percent change between CY2009 and CY2008 composite rate payments to ESRD facilities. The CY2009 payments 
include the CY2009 wage adjusted composite rate, and the 15.5 percent drug add-on times treatments. The CY2008 payments to ESRD facilities 
includes the CY2008 wage adjusted composite rate and the 15.5 percent drug add-on times treatments. 
G. IDTF Issues 
We believe that our proposals 
regarding IDTFs as discussed in Section 
II.I. of this proposed rule would have 
minimal budgetary impact. However, 
we believe that these changes are 
necessary to ensure that only IDTFs 
enrolled in the Medicare program are 
billing for the services provided and 
that the services are provided by 
properly qualified individuals. 
Additionally, the provisions in this rule 
would require physicians, NPPs, and 
physician or NPP groups to enroll as an 
IDTF when they are performing 
diagnostic testing procedures. This 
requirement would help ensure that 
properly qualified individuals are 
performing these diagnostic testing 
procedures. Also, we believe that the 
proposed IDTF provisions contained in 
this rule will help ensure that 
beneficiaries receive quality care 
regardless of the setting in which they 
are provided. We are unable to 
determine the extent that IDTFS and 
physicians, NPPs, and physician or NPP 
groups currently providing diagnostic 
testing procedures will be unable to 
meet these requirements and therefore 
have their billing privileges revoked or 
be denied enrollment into the Medicare 
program. However, we do not believe 
that beneficiary access to these services 
will be affected. 
H. Physician and Nonphysician 
Practitioner Enrollment Issues 
We believe that our proposals 
regarding physicians, NPPs, and 
physician and nonphysician groups as 
discussed in section II.J. of this 
proposed rule would have minimal 
budgetary impact. 
As a result of currently not having 
quantifiable data, we cannot effectively 
derive an estimate of the monetary 
impacts of these provisions. 
Accordingly, we are seeking public 
comment so that the public may provide 
any data available that provides a 
calculable impact or any alternative to 
the proposed provisions. 
I. Proposed Amendment to the 
Exemption for Computer-Generated 
Facsimile Transmissions From the 
NCPDP SCRIPT Standard for 
Transmitting Prescription and Certain 
Prescription-Related Information for 
Part D-Covered Drugs Prescribed to Part 
D Eligible Individuals 
The amendment to the exemption for 
computer-generated facsimiles from the 
NCPDP SCRIPT Standard under the 
Medicare Part D e-prescribing 
provisions is discussed in section II.K. 
of this rule. E-prescribing Part D covered 
drugs to Part D eligible individuals is 
voluntary for providers and dispensers. 
The MMA only requires that if 
prescribers and dispensers choose to 
e-prescribe, that they use the standards 
adopted by the Secretary for those 
specific e-prescribing transactions. The 
proposed amendment to the exemption 
for computer-generated faxing from the 
NCPDP SCRIPT standard only affects 
pharmacies that already conduct 
e-prescribing using products that 
generate facsimiles. 
This proposed amendment of the 
exemption for computer-generated 
facsimiles to include prescription refill 
requests sent from dispensers to 
providers who do not possess the 
capability to conduct electronic refill 
request transactions using the NCPDP 
SCRIPT standard will not affect non- 
NCPDP SCRIPT enabled prescribers. 
Prescribers that currently e-prescribe 
using NCPDP SCRIPT would continue 
to receive refill requests electronically. 
Prescribers that currently e-prescribe 
with computer-generated faxes using a 
system that can utilize the NCPDP 
SCRIPT standard will simply turn that 
function on, and receive refill request 
transactions using the NCPDP SCRIPT 
standard in place of the computer- 
generated facsimiles that they used to 
receive. Prescribers that do not have the 
capacity to use NCPDP SCRIPT standard 
would continue to receive computer- 
generated facsimiles. Moreover, the 
proposed amendment would not impose 
costs on dispensers, as they would be 
permitted to continue using computer- 
generated facsimiles with partners that 
cannot conduct electronic refill request 
transactions using the NCPDP SCRIPT 
standard. The proposed amendment 
will have direct benefits for dispensers. 
One national drug store chain estimated 
that its stores generate 150,000 non-EDI 
prescription refill requests each day. If 
the computer-generated facsimile 
exemption were not modified as 
proposed here these dispensers would 
have to revert to paper/phone calls in 
instances in which a provider is not able 
to accept electronic refill requests

2 CVS/Caremark Discussion Points on E-Fax 
Ruling Exceptions, January 3, 2007. 
3 December 22, 2007 correspondence from 
Walgreen’s to CMS re: CMS–1385–FC, Final Rule 
with Comment Period: Amendment of the E- 
Prescribing Exemption for Computer-Generated 
Facsimile Transmissions. 
4 http://www.statehealthfacts.org. 
5 CMS, November 16, 2007 Proposed Rule, 72 FR 
64913. 
utilizing the NCPDP SCRIPT standard. 
One chain pharmacy has relayed that 
moving forward with the scheduled 
elimination of the computer-generated 
faxing exception to the NCPDP SCRIPT 
standard in all instances other than 
transmission failures and similar 
communication problems of temporary 
or transient nature would result in 
approximately 105,000 initial paper 
facsimiles and 45,000 initial phone 
calls/oral scripts per day. They also 
consider a 2 percent facsimile failure 
rate that translates into phone calls, or 
approximately 2,100 additional phone 
calls per day. Ten percent of all phone 
calls require a second call back, or 4,710 
call backs per day. Therefore, without 
further modification of computer- 
generated facsimiles exception, as of 
January 1, 2009 this national drug store 
chain would have to make a total of 
51,810 additional phone calls for 
prescription refill requests per day. 
They estimate the cost of reverting to 
paper facsimiles, including purchasing 
fax machines, labor, paper, printing, 
hardware and service costs at over $12.5 
million a year. They also estimate the 
cost per year of phone calls, including 
an average of 4 minutes per call, labor 
and telecommunication costs, at more 
than $78 million per year, for a total 
cost for faxes and phone calls of $88.8 
million per year.2 
Another national drug store chain 
offered a similar analysis. They 
estimated that a prescription refill 
request undertaken by telephone takes 
1.43 minutes longer to complete than 
one initiated by computer-generated 
facsimile. Without further modification 
of the computer-generated facsimile 
exception, as of January 1, 2009 this 
national drug store chain would have to 
replace the more than 123 million 
computer-generated facsimile refill 
requests that are made each year with 
phone calls or paper faxes. They 
estimate that this would result in 9.2 
lost hours of staff time per store per 
week, resulting in $88 million in 
additional costs, based on a blended 
payroll rate of pharmacists and staff. 
Extrapolating this cost across the entire 
pharmacy industry based on this 
commenter’s market share, they 
estimated an impending pharmacy 
industry loss of at least $520 million 
unless the computer-generated facsimile 
exception is further modified.3 
According to industry reports in 2006 
approximately 3.309 billion 
prescriptions 4 were filled by retail 
dispensers, and according to CMS data, 
in 2006, approximately 825,000,000 Part 
D claims (prescription drug events) were 
finalized and accepted for payment,5 or 
approximately 25 percent of the total 
prescriptions filled that year. Thus, 
$130 million of the $520 million total 
loss estimated above would be 
attributable to Medicare Part D claims. 
We invite comments on these savings 
and loss assumptions estimates and 
assumptions. 
We also assume that expanding the 
computer-generated facsimile exception 
to allow for computer-generated faxing 
in instances in which the provider is 
incapable of receiving electronic refill 
request transactions using the NCPDP 
SCRIPT standard would result in 
improved patient satisfaction through 
timely prescription refill request 
authorizations from prescribers, and 
maintenance of existing workflows at 
both the prescriber and dispenser ends. 
J. CORF Issues 
The revisions to the CORF regulations 
discussed in section II.L. of this 
proposed rule update the regulations for 
consistency with the PFS payment rules 
and make additional changes to the 
conditions of participation to reflect 
industry standards. These revisions will 
help to clarify payment and operational 
requirements for CORF services and are 
expected to have minimal impact on 
Medicare expenditures. 
K. Therapy Issues 
The revisions to the therapy 
regulations discussed in section II.M. of 
this proposed rule make technical 
corrections and update the regulations 
and are expected to have minimal 
impact on Medicare expenditures. 
L. Physician Self-Referral Provisions 
1. Incentive Payment and Shared 
Savings Programs 
Our proposal in section II.N. of this 
proposed rule would provide an 
exception to the physician self-referral 
statute to permit incentive payments 
between physicians and entities 
furnishing designated health services 
(DHS), provided that certain conditions 
are satisfied. We are not proposing to 
implement new incentive payment and 
shared savings programs, but merely are 
proposing an exception in § 411.357(x) 
that would allow for remuneration 
provided by a hospital to a physician or 
to a qualified physician organization 
under an incentive payment or shared 
savings program that satisfies certain 
conditions. We believe that this 
exception would remove a barrier to 
participation in certain incentive 
payment and shared savings programs 
that may exist currently. We recognize 
the potential for an indirect, 
unquantifiable increase in the number 
of incentive payment and shared 
savings programs that, as a result of this 
exception, will be permitted to function 
as originally intended. However, 
because the purpose of incentive 
payment and shared savings programs is 
to increase quality while decreasing 
cost, we do not believe that our proposal 
would have a budgetary impact. 
2. Anti-Markup Provisions 
We anticipate that our proposal in 
section II.N. of this proposed rule 
concerning the anti-markup provisions 
in § 414.50 would result in savings to 
the program by reducing overutilization 
and anti-competitive business 
arrangements. We cannot gauge with 
any certainty the extent of these savings 
to the Medicare program. 
M. Physician Quality Reporting 
Initiative 
As discussed section II.O. of this 
proposed rule, the proposed 2009 PQRI 
measures satisfy the requirement of 
section 1848(k)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act that 
the Secretary publish in the Federal 
Register by August 15, 2008 a proposed 
set of measures that the Secretary 
determines would be appropriate for 
eligible professionals to use to submit 
data to the Secretary in 2009. As 
discussed in section II.O. of this 
proposed rule, we are also offering 
options in 2009 for reporting some of 
the 2009 PQRI measures via submission 
of data to a clinical registry, options for 
reporting some of the 2009 PQRI 
measures via EHR-based submission, 
and options for reporting on measures 
groups rather than individual measures. 
Although there may be some cost 
incurred for maintaining the measures 
and their associated code sets, and for 
expanding an existing clinical data 
warehouse to accommodate registry- 
based data submission, we do not 
anticipate a significant cost impact on 
the Medicare program. 
N. Educational Requirements for Nurse 
Practitioners and Clinical Nurse 
Specialists 
We anticipate that there are no 
program cost savings or increased 
expenditures associated with the 
proposed changes discussed in section 
II.Q. of this proposed rule. However, we

expect that the technical correction to 
the NP qualifications will make the 
regulations comport with the agency’s 
intent to require a master’s degree in 
nursing as the minimum educational 
level for new practitioners 
independently treating beneficiaries and 
directly billing the Medicare program. 
Also, the proposed changes to the NP 
and CNS educational requirement to 
include the DNP doctoral degree will 
help to eliminate any concern or 
confusion for contractors and the 
nursing industry about whether APNs 
with doctoral degrees in nursing (but 
without a master’s degree in nursing) 
meet our program qualifications. 
O. Portable X-Ray Personnel 
Qualifications 
We anticipate that there are no 
program cost savings or increased 
expenditures associated with the 
proposed changes discussed in section 
II.R. of this proposed rule; however, we 
expect that the revisions to the 
regulations will have a positive impact 
on patient care. 
P. Prohibition Concerning Providers of 
Sleep Tests 
The proposal contained in section 
II.T.2 of this proposed rule will reduce 
Medicare Trust Fund vulnerability to 
fraud and abuse and protect Medicare 
Beneficiaries from the burden of 
unnecessary sleep testing and 
unnecessary exposure to a medical 
device. This prohibition will have no 
effect on most providers as most 
providers are not DMEPOS suppliers 
who would be supplying CPAP devices. 
Only providers or other entities that 
perform both sleep testing and supply 
CPAP machines to beneficiaries they 
have tested will be impacted. 
Q. Beneficiary Signature Requirements 
for Nonemergency Ambulance Services 
We believe that our proposal in 
section II.T.3. of this proposed rule for 
allowing the ambulance provider or 
supplier to sign the claim on behalf of 
the beneficiary with respect to 
nonemergency transport services, 
provided that certain conditions are 
satisfied, would have no budgetary 
impact. 
R. Revision to the ‘‘Appeals of CMS or 
CMS Contractor Determinations When a 
Provider or Supplier Fails to Meet the 
Requirements for Medicare Billing 
Privileges’’ Final Rule 
We expect that the proposal in section 
II.T.5. of this proposed rule will have an 
impact on an unknown number of 
persons and entities; however, we 
believe that this provision will impact 
only a small number of providers and 
suppliers whose billing privileges are 
revoked due to felony convictions, 
license suspensions or revocation, or 
because the provider or supplier is no 
longer operating at a practice location 
provided to Medicare. We also believe 
that while this provision changes the 
effective date of revocation for certain 
providers and supplier that are no 
longer in compliance with Medicare 
enrollment requirements, this provision 
does not expand or change our 
revocation authority. 
As a result of not having quantifiable 
data for the providers and suppliers that 
meet the proposed criteria for 
immediate revocation, we cannot 
effectively derive an estimate of the 
monetary impacts of this provision. 
Accordingly, we are seeking public 
comment so that the public may provide 
any data available that provides a 
calculable impact or any alternative to 
the proposed provision. 
S. Alternatives Considered 
This proposed rule contains a range of 
policies, including some provisions 
related to specific MMA provisions. The 
preamble provides descriptions of the 
statutory provisions that are addressed, 
identifies those policies when discretion 
has been exercised, presents rationale 
for our decisions and, where relevant, 
alternatives that were considered. 
T. Impact on Beneficiaries 
There are a number of changes made 
in this proposed rule that would have 
an effect on beneficiaries. In general, we 
believe these changes, including the 
refinements of the PQRI with its focus 
on measuring, submitting, and 
analyzing quality data, the 
modifications to personnel 
qualifications and the application of 
certain IDTF standards to physician and 
NPPs office practices will have a 
positive impact and improve the quality 
and value of care provided to Medicare 
beneficiaries. 
We do not believe that beneficiaries 
will experience drug access issues as a 
result of the proposed changes with 
respect to Part B drugs and CAP and 
discontinuation of payment for 
preadministration services associated 
with IVIG. 
As explained in more detail 
subsequently in this section, the 
regulatory provisions may affect 
beneficiary liability in some cases. Most 
changes in aggregate beneficiary liability 
from a particular provision would be a 
function of the coinsurance (20 percent 
if applicable for the particular provision 
after the beneficiary has met the 
deductible) and the effect of the 
aggregate cost (savings) of the provision 
on the standard calculation of the 
Medicare Part B premium rate (generally 
25 percent of the provision’s cost or 
savings). In 2009, total cost sharing 
(coinsurance and deductible) per Part B 
enrollee associated with physician fee 
schedule services is estimated to be 
$558. In addition, the portion of the 
2009 standard monthly Part B premium 
attributable to PFS services is estimated 
to be $32.50. 
To illustrate this point, as shown in 
Table 26, the 2008 national payment 
amount in the nonfacility setting for 
CPT code 99203 (Office/outpatient visit, 
new), is $81.42 which means that 
currently (July 1 through December 31) 
a beneficiary is responsible for 20 
percent of this amount, or 16.28. Based 
on this proposed rule, the 2009 national 
payment amount in the nonfacility 
setting for CPT code 99203, as shown in 
Table 29, is $77.03 which means that, in 
2009, the beneficiary coinsurance for 
this service would be $15.41. 
Proposed policies discussed in this 
rule that do affect overall spending, 
such as the proposed additions to the 
list of codes that are subject to the 
multiple procedure payment reduction 
for diagnostic imaging, would similarly 
impact beneficiaries’ coinsurance. 
U. Accounting Statement 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/ 
a004/a-4.pdf), in Table 31, we have 
prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with this 
proposed rule. This estimate includes 
the incurred benefit impact associated 
with the estimated CY 2009 PFS update, 
shown in this proposed rule, based on 
the 2008 Trustees Report baseline. All 
estimated impacts are classified as 
transfers.

38605 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 130 / Monday, July 7, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
(1) The remuneration is provided as 
part of a documented incentive payment 
or shared savings program to achieve— 
(i) The improvement of quality of 
hospital patient care services through 
changes in physician clinical or 
administrative practices; or 
(ii) Actual cost savings for the 
hospital resulting from the reduction of 
waste or changes in physician clinical 
or administrative practices, without an 
adverse effect on or diminution in the 
quality of hospital patient care services. 
(2) The incentive payment or shared 
savings program identifies patient care 
quality measures or cost saving 
measures (for purposes of this 
paragraph, collectively, ‘‘performance 
measures’’) or both that— 
(i) Use an objective methodology, are 
verifiable, are supported by credible 
medical evidence, and are individually 
tracked; 
(ii) Are reasonably related to the 
hospital’s or comparable hospitals’ 
practices and patient population; 
(iii) With respect to patient care 
quality measures, are listed in CMS’ 
Specification Manual for National 
Hospital Quality Measures; and 
(iv) Are monitored throughout the 
term of the arrangement to protect 
against inappropriate reductions or 
limitations in patient care services. 
(3) The incentive payment or shared 
savings program establishes— 
(i) Baseline levels for the performance 
measures using the hospital’s historical 
and clinical data; and 
(ii) Target levels for the performance 
measures that are developed by 
comparing historical data for the 
hospital’s practices and patient 
population to national or regional data 
for comparable hospitals’ practices and 
patient populations; and 
(iii) Thresholds above or below which 
no payments will accrue to physicians. 
(4) At least five physicians participate 
in each performance measure (the 
‘‘participating physician pool’’). 
Physicians participating in the incentive 
payment or shared savings program 
(‘‘participating physicians’’) must be on 
the medical staff of the hospital at the 
commencement of the program, and 
may not be selected in a manner that 
takes into account the volume or value 
of referrals or other business generated 
between the parties. A hospital may 
elect to make an incentive payment or 
shared savings program available to 
physicians in a particular department or 
specialty, provided that the hospital 
offers the opportunity to participate in 
the incentive payment or shared savings 
program to all physicians in the 
department or specialty on the same 
terms and conditions. 
(5) The incentive payment or shared 
savings program requires independent 
medical review of the program’s impact 
on the quality of patient care services 
provided at the hospital and corrective 
action if the independent medical 
review indicates a diminution in the 
quality of hospital patient care services. 
The independent medical review must 
be completed prior to the 
commencement of the incentive 
payment or shared savings program 
(with respect to the program’s potential 
impact on the quality of patient care 
services provided at the hospital) and at 
least annually thereafter. For purposes 
of this paragraph, ‘‘independent medical 
review,’’ means written review by an 
individual or organization that is— 
(i) Not affiliated with the hospital; 
(ii) Not affiliated with any 
participating physician or any physician 
organization to which any participating 
physician belongs; and 
(iii) At the time of the review, not 
participating in any incentive payment 
or shared savings program at the 
hospital. 
(6) Under the incentive payment or 
shared savings program— 
(i) Physicians must have access to the 
same selection of items, supplies or 
devices as was available at the hospital 
prior to the commencement of the 
program, and must not be restricted in 
their ability to make medically 
appropriate decisions for their patients, 
including, but not limited to, decisions 
about tests, treatments, procedures, 
services, supplies or discharge; 
(ii) The hospital may not make a 
payment to a participating physician or 
a qualified physician organization for 
the use of an item, supply or device if 
the physician or qualified physician 
organization has an ownership or 
investment interest in, or a 
compensation arrangement with, the 
manufacturer, distributor or group 
purchasing organization that arranges 
for the purchase of the item, supply or 
device; and 
(iii) The hospital may not limit the 
availability of new technology that— 
(A) Is linked through objective 
evidence to improved outcomes and is 
clinically appropriate for a particular 
patient; and 
(B) Meets the same Federal regulatory 
standards as technology available under 
the incentive payment or shared savings 
program (for example, approval by the 
Food and Drug Administration and 
Medicare or Medicaid coverage 
decisions). 
(7) The hospital provides effective 
prior written notice to patients affected 
by the incentive payment or shared 
savings program that— 
(i) Identifies the physicians 
participating in the program; 
(ii) Discloses that participating 
physicians receive payments for 
meeting targets for performance 
measures; and 
(iii) Describes the performance 
measures in a manner reasonably 
designed to inform patients about the 
program. 
(8) The arrangement is set out in 
writing, is signed by the parties, and 
specifies the remuneration (or a formula 
for the remuneration) in detail sufficient 
to be independently verified, including 
a comprehensive description of the 
incentive payment or shared savings 
program in which the physician is 
participating, the applicable baseline 
measures, and the targets for 
performance measures to be achieved by 
the participating physician. To satisfy 
this requirement, each specific 
performance measure and the resulting 
payment (or a formula for the resulting 
payment) to the participating physician 
or qualified physician organization must 
be clearly and separately identified. 
(9) The performance measures 
provided for under the arrangement do 
not involve the counseling or promotion 
of a business arrangement or other 
activity that violates any Federal or 
State law and, in the aggregate, are 
reasonable and necessary for the 
legitimate business purposes of the 
arrangement. 
(10) The term of the arrangement is 
for no less than 1 year and no more than 
3 years. 
(11) Payments must take into account 
previous payments made for 
performance measures already achieved 
to ensure that the participating 
physician or qualified physician 
organization does not receive payment 
related to patient care quality 
improvements or cost savings that were 
achieved during a prior period of the 
arrangement. No payment may be made 
for the achievement of cost savings that 
results in a diminution in hospital 
patient care quality with respect to that 
performance measure. 
(12) Payments are limited in duration 
and amount. For purposes of calculating 
the actual payments to the physician, 
cost savings are measured by comparing 
the hospital’s actual acquisition costs 
for the items and supplies or costs of 
providing the specified services that are 
subject to the shared savings program to 
the hospital’s baseline costs for the same 
items, supplies or services during the 1- 
year period immediately preceding the 
commencement of the program. 
(13) The remuneration to be paid over 
the term of the arrangement (or the 
formula for the remuneration) is—

(i) Set in advance, does not vary 
during the term of the arrangement, and 
is not determined in a manner that takes 
into account the volume or value of 
referrals or other business generated 
between the parties; 
(ii) Not based in whole or in part on 
a reduction in the length of stay for a 
particular patient or in the aggregate for 
the hospital; 
(iii) Distributed to the physicians in 
each participating physician pool or in 
each qualified physician organization if 
the qualified physician organization 
consists of at least five participating 
physicians on a per capita basis with 
respect to each performance measure; 
and 
(iv) Paid directly to participating 
physicians or qualified physician 
organizations. 
(14) The remuneration paid to a 
participating physician or qualified 
physician organization may not include 
any amount that takes into account the 
provision of a greater volume of Federal 
health care patient procedures or 
services than the volume provided by 
the participating physician or qualified 
physician organization during the 
period of the same length immediately 
preceding the commencement of the 
program as that covered by the payment. 
(15) The hospital maintains accurate 
and contemporaneous documentation of 
the incentive payment or shared savings 
program and makes such documentation 
available to the Secretary upon request, 
including, but not limited to, the 
following: 
(i) The written agreement between the 
parties; 
(ii) The basis for the selection of the 
performance measures; 
(iii) The selection and qualifications 
of the individual or organization 
designated as the independent medical 
reviewer; 
(iv) The written findings of the 
independent medical reviewer; 
(v) Corrective actions taken by the 
hospital based on the written findings of 
the independent medical reviewer (or 
any other review indicating that 
corrective action was needed); 
(vi) The amount and calculation of 
payments made under the incentive 
payment or shared savings program, 
including the hospital’s projected and 
actual acquisition costs where relevant; 
(vii) The re-basing of performance 
measures; and 
(viii) The written notification 
provided to hospital patients. 
(16) The arrangement does not violate 
the anti-kickback statute (section 
1128B(b) of the Social Security Act) or 
any Federal or State law or regulation 
governing billing or claims submission.

site other than the office of the billing 
physician or other supplier. 
(a) General rules. Except as provided 
for in paragraph (b) of this section, for 
services covered under section 
1861(s)(3) of the Act— 
(1) * * * 
(i) The performing supplier’s net 
charge to the billing physician or other 
supplier’s actual charge. For purposes of 
this paragraph (a)(1) only, with respect 
to the TC, the performing supplier is the 
physician who supervised the TC, and 
with respect to the PC, the performing 
supplier is the physician who 
performed the PC. 
* * * * * 
(2) * * * 
(ii) An ‘‘outside supplier’’ does not 
include a physician who is an employee 
or independent contractor of the billing 
physician or other supplier and who 
furnishes the test or interpretation to the 
billing physician or other supplier 
under a reassignment that meets the 
requirements of § 424.80 of this 
subchapter; 
(iii) The TC of a diagnostic test is not 
subject to paragraph (a) if the TC is both 
conducted and supervised within the 
office of the billing physician or other 
supplier and the supervising physician 
is an employee or independent 
contractor of the billing physician or

ordering physician or other ordering 
supplier regularly furnishes patient 
care, and includes space where the 
billing physician or other supplier 
furnishes diagnostic testing, if the space 
is located in the same building (as 
defined in § 411.351) in which the 
ordering physician or other ordering 
supplier regularly furnishes patient 
care. With respect to a billing physician 
or other supplier that is a physician 
organization (as defined in § 411.351 of 
this chapter), the ‘‘office of the billing 
physician or other supplier’’ is space in 
which the ordering physician provides 
substantially the full range of patient 
care services that the ordering physician 
provides generally. 
(b) Exception. Except with respect to 
the purchase of a TC from an outside 
supplier, the requirements of paragraph 
(a) of this section do not apply to 
diagnostic tests ordered by a physician 
in a physician organization that does 
not have any owners who have the right

Note: These addenda will not appear in the 
Code of Federal Regulations. 
Addendum A: Explanation and Use of 
Addenda B 
The addenda on the following pages 
provide various data pertaining to the 
Medicare fee schedule for physicians’ 
services furnished in 2009. Addendum B 
contains the RVUs for work, non-facility PE, 
facility PE, and malpractice expense, and 
other information for all services included in 
the PFS. 
In previous years, we have listed many 
services in Addendum B that are not paid 
under the PFS. To avoid publishing as many 
pages of codes for these services, we are not 
including clinical laboratory codes or the 
alpha-numeric codes (Healthcare Common 
Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes not 
included in CPT) not paid under the PFS in 
Addendum B. 
Addendum B—2009 Relative Value Units 
and Related Information Used in Determining 
Medicare Payments for 2009 
This addendum contains the following 
information for each CPT code and alpha- 
numeric HCPCS code, except for: Alpha- 
numeric codes beginning with B (enteral and 
parenteral therapy), E (durable medical 
equipment), K (temporary codes for 
nonphysicians’ services or items), or L 
(orthotics); and codes for anesthesiology. 
Please also note the following: 
• An ‘‘NA’’ in the ‘‘Non-facility PE RVUs’’ 
column of Addendum B means that CMS has 
not developed a PE RVU in the non-facility 
setting for the service because it is typically 
performed in the hospital (for example, an 
open heart surgery is generally performed in 
the hospital setting and not a physician’s 
office). If there is an ‘‘NA’’ in the non-facility 
PE RVU column, and the contractor 
determines that this service can be performed 
in the non-facility setting, the service will be 
paid at the facility PE RVU rate. 
• Services that have an ‘‘NA’’ in the 
‘‘Facility PE RVUs’’ column of Addendum B 
are typically not paid using the PFS when 
provided in a facility setting. These services 
(which include ‘‘incident to’’ services and 
the technical portion of diagnostic tests) are 
generally paid under either the outpatient 
hospital prospective payment system or 
bundled into the hospital inpatient 
prospective payment system payment. 
1. CPT/HCPCS code. This is the CPT or 
alpha-numeric HCPCS number for the 
service. Alpha-numeric HCPCS codes are 
included at the end of this addendum. 
2. Modifier. A modifier is shown if there 
is a technical component (modifier TC) and 
a professional component (PC) (modifier–26) 
for the service. If there is a PC and a TC for 
the service, Addendum B contains three 
entries for the code. A code for: The global 
values (both professional and technical); 
modifier–26 (PC); and, modifier TC. The 
global service is not designated by a modifier, 
and physicians must bill using the code 
without a modifier if the physician furnishes 
both the PC and the TC of the service. 
Modifier–53 is shown for a discontinued 
procedure, for example a colonoscopy that is 
not completed. There will be RVUs for a code 
with this modifier. 
3. Status indicator. This indicator shows 
whether the CPT/HCPCS code is in the PFS 
and whether it is separately payable if the 
service is covered. 
A = Active code. These codes are 
separately payable under the PFS if covered. 
There will be RVUs for codes with this 
status. The presence of an ‘‘A’’ indicator does 
not mean that Medicare has made a national 
coverage determination regarding the service. 
Carriers remain responsible for coverage 
decisions in the absence of a national 
Medicare policy. 
B = Bundled code. Payments for covered 
services are always bundled into payment for 
other services not specified. If RVUs are 
shown, they are not used for Medicare 
payment. If these services are covered, 
payment for them is subsumed by the 
payment for the services to which they are 
incident (an example is a telephone call from 
a hospital nurse regarding care of a patient). 
C = Carriers price the code. Carriers will 
establish RVUs and payment amounts for 
these services, generally on an individual 
case basis following review of 
documentation, such as an operative report. 
D* = Deleted/discontinued code. 
E = Excluded from the PFS by regulation. 
These codes are for items and services that 
CMS chose to exclude from the fee schedule 
payment by regulation. No RVUs are shown, 
and no payment may be made under the PFS 
for these codes. Payment for them, when 
covered, continues under reasonable charge 
procedures. 
F = Deleted/discontinued codes. (Code not 
subject to a 90-day grace period.) These codes 
are deleted effective with the beginning of 
the year and are never subject to a grace 
period. This indicator is no longer effective 
beginning with the 2005 fee schedule as of 
January 1, 2005. 
G = Code not valid for Medicare purposes. 
Medicare uses another code for reporting of, 
and payment for, these services. (Codes 
subject to a 90-day grace period.) This 
indicator is no longer effective with the 2005 
PFS as of January 1, 2005. 
H* = Deleted modifier. For 2000 and later 
years, either the TC or PC shown for the code 
has been deleted and the deleted component 
is shown in the database with the H status 
indicator. 
I = Not valid for Medicare purposes. 
Medicare uses another code for the reporting 
of, and the payment for these services. (Codes 
not subject to a 90-day grace period.) 
L = Local codes. Carriers will apply this 
status to all local codes in effect on January 
1, 1998 or subsequently approved by central 
office for use. Carriers will complete the 
RVUs and payment amounts for these codes. 
M = Measurement codes, used for reporting 
purposes only. There are no RVUs and no 
payment amounts for these codes. Medicare 
uses them to aid with performance 
measurement. No separate payment is made. 
These codes should be billed with a zero 
(($0.00) charge and are denied) on the 
MPFSDB. 
N = Non-covered service. These codes are 
noncovered services. Medicare payment may 
not be made for these codes. If RVUs are 
shown, they are not used for Medicare 
payment. 
R = Restricted coverage. Special coverage 
instructions apply. If the service is covered 
and no RVUs are shown, it is carrier-priced. 
T = There are RVUs for these services, but 
they are only paid if there are no other 
services payable under the PFS billed on the 
same date by the same provider. If any other 
services payable under the PFS are billed on 
the same date by the same provider, these 
services are bundled into the service(s) for 
which payment is made. 
X = Statutory exclusion. These codes 
represent an item or service that is not within 
the statutory definition of ‘‘physicians’ 
services’’ for PFS payment purposes. No

RVUs are shown for these codes, and no 
payment may be made under the PFS. 
(Examples are ambulance services and 
clinical diagnostic laboratory services.) 
4. Description of code. This is an 
abbreviated version of the narrative 
description of the code. 
5. Physician work RVUs. These are the 
RVUs for the physician work for this service 
in 2009. Note: The separate BN adjustor is 
not reflected in these physician work RVUs. 
6. Fully implemented non-facility practice 
expense RVUs. These are the fully 
implemented resource-based PE RVUs for 
non-facility settings. 
7. Transitional Non-facility practice 
expense RVUs. These are the 2009 resource- 
based PE RVUs for non-facility settings. 
8. Fully implemented facility practice 
expense RVUs. These are the fully 
implemented resource-based PE RVUs for 
facility settings. 
9. Transitional facility practice expense 
RVUs. These are the 2009 resource-based PE 
RVUs for facility settings. 
10. Malpractice expense RVUs. These are 
the RVUs for the malpractice expense for the 
service for 2009. 
11. Global period. This indicator shows the 
number of days in the global period for the 
code (0, 10, or 90 days). An explanation of 
the alpha codes follows: 
MMM = Code describes a service furnished 
in uncomplicated maternity cases including 
antepartum care, delivery, and postpartum 
care. The usual global surgical concept does 
not apply. See the 1999 Physicians’ Current 
Procedural Terminology for specific 
definitions. 
XXX = The global concept does not apply. 
YYY = The global period is to be set by the 
carrier (for example, unlisted surgery codes). 
ZZZ = Code related to another service that 
is always included in the global period of the 
other service. (Note: Physician work and PE 
are associated with intra service time and in 
some instances in the post service time. 
*Codes with these indicators had a 90-day 
grace period before January 1, 2005.
