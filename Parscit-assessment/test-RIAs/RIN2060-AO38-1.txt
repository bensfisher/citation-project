§ 80.501 What fuel is subject to the provisions of this subpart? 
 162
(a) Included fuel and additives.  The provisions of this subpart apply to the following fuels 
and additives except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section: 
(1) Motor vehicle diesel fuel. 
(2) Nonroad, locomotive, or marine diesel fuel. 
(3) Diesel fuel additives. 
(4) Heating oil. 
(5) ECA marine fuel. 
(6) Other distillate fuels. 
(7) Motor oil that is used as or intended for use as fuel in diesel motor vehicles or 
nonroad diesel engines or is blended with diesel fuel for use in diesel motor 
vehicles or nonroad diesel engines, including locomotive and marine diesel 
engines, at any downstream location. 
(b) Excluded fuel.  The provisions of this subpart do not apply to distillate fuel that is 
designated for export outside the United States in accordance with §80.598, identified for 
export by a transfer document as required under §80.590, and that is exported. 
 
§ 80.502 What definitions apply for purposes of this subpart? 
The definitions of §80.2 and the following additional definitions apply to this subpart I: 
(a) Entity means any refiner, importer, distributor, retailer or wholesale-purchaser consumer 
of any distillate fuel. 
(b) Facility means any place, or series of places, where an entity produces, imports, or 
maintains custody of any distillate fuel from the time it is received to the time custody is 
transferred to another entity, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of 
this section: 
(1) Where an entity maintains custody of a batch of diesel fuel from one place in the 
distribution system to another place (e.g., from a pipeline to a terminal), all owned 
by the same entity, both places combined are considered to be one single 
aggregated facility, except where an entity chooses to treat components of such an 
aggregated facility as separate facilities. The choice made to treat these places as 
separate facilities may not be changed by the entity during any applicable 
compliance period. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, where 
compliance requirements depend upon facility-type, the entire facility must 
comply with the requirements that apply to its components as follows: 
(i) If an aggregated facility includes a refinery, the entire facility must 
comply with the requirements applicable to refineries. 
(ii) If an aggregated facility includes a truck loading terminal but not a 
refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable 
to truck loading terminals. 
(iii) Situations where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal. 
(A) Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, 
diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this 
subpart I produced by such refinery and distributed over the truck 
terminal rack must be included in refinery batches that may be 
based on shipments to a truck terminal rack tank or on the total 
volumes delivered to tanker trucks for a period not to exceed 1 
calendar month per batch. 
 163
(B) Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, 
diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this 
subpart I that were imported or produced by another refinery, and 
that are distributed through the refinery or truck terminal rack, 
must be treated as previously designated fuel for which the 
aggregated facility is responsible for all applicable balance and 
downgrade requirements under §§80.527, 80.598, 80.599 and 
related recordkeeping and reporting requirements like any other 
distributor downstream from the refiner or importer. 
(2) A refinery or import facility may not be aggregated with facilities that receive fuel 
from other refineries or import facilities, either directly or indirectly. For example, 
a refinery may not be aggregated with a terminal that receives any fuel from a 
common carrier pipeline. However, a refinery may be aggregated with a pipeline 
and terminal that are owned by the same entity and which receive no fuel from 
any source other than the refinery. Likewise, a refinery may not be aggregated 
with a mobile facility that is also carrying another entity's fuel; it may however be 
aggregated with a mobile facility that does not receive fuel from any source other 
than the refinery. If a refinery or import facility is aggregated with other facilities, 
then the aggregated facility is treated as a refinery or import facility. 
(3) Retail outlets or wholesale purchaser consumers may not be aggregated with any 
other facility. 
(4) Mobile components and mobile facilities.  
(i) Where an entity maintains custody of diesel fuel in one or more mobile 
components (e.g., rail, barge, shipping, or trucking operations), the mobile 
components may be aggregated as a single facility. Mobile components 
may also be aggregated with a facility from which they receive fuel or a 
facility to which they deliver fuel. However, mobile components may not 
be aggregated with both a facility from which they receive fuel and a 
facility to which they deliver fuel. 
(ii) When an entity maintains title to, but not custody of, diesel fuel in one or 
more mobile components, the entity may treat the mobile component(s) as 
a facility under this paragraph (b), but only for the fuel to which the entity 
has title. In the event that title changes while a mobile component is in 
transport (but the fuel physically remains in the same mobile facility), the 
original entity that had title to the fuel continues to be responsible for the 
designate and track requirements until custody of the fuel is transferred 
from the mobile facility. 
(5) An individual refinery or contiguous pipeline may not be subdivided into more 
than one facility. An individual terminal may not be subdivided into more than 
one facility unless approved by the Administrator. 
(c) Truck loading terminal means any facility that dyes NRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine 
fuel, pays taxes on motor vehicle diesel fuel per IRS code (26 CFR part 48), or adds a 
fuel marker pursuant to §80.510 to heating oil and delivers diesel fuel or heating oil into 
trucks for delivery to retail or ultimate consumer locations. 
(d) Batch means a quantity of diesel fuel or distillate which is homogeneous with regard to 
those properties that are specified for MVNRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel under 
 164
this subpart I of this part, has the same designation under this subpart I (if applicable), 
and whose custody is transferred from one facility to another facility. 
(1) In the case of aggregated facilities consisting of a refinery and a truck loading 
terminal, a batch may be defined by one of the following methods: 
(i) The sum of the deliveries from the truck loading terminal rack to trucks 
for periods not to exceed 1 month; 
(ii) Each individual truck or truck compartment; or 
(iii) For refineries with “certification tanks” where testing is performed and 
“rack tanks” that feed the truck loading terminal rack, each transfer from 
the certification tank to the rack tank. If this method of determining a 
batch is selected, it must be the sole method used and must be performed 
such that no double-counting or undercounting of volumes occurs. 
(2) [Reserved] 
(e) Downstream location means any point in the diesel fuel distribution system that is 
downstream of refineries and import facilities, for example, diesel fuel at facilities of 
distributors, carriers, retailers, kerosene blenders, and wholesale purchaser-consumers. 
(f) Definition of PADD. For the purposes of this subpart only, the following definitions of

§ 80.581 What are the batch testing and sample retention requirements for motor 
vehicle diesel fuel, NRLM diesel fuel, and ECA marine fuel? 
(a) Beginning on June 1, 2006 or earlier pursuant to §80.531 for motor vehicle diesel fuel, 
beginning June 1, 2010 or earlier pursuant to §80.535 for NRLM diesel fuel, and 
beginning June 1, 2014 for ECA marine fuel, each refiner and importer shall collect a 
representative sample from each batch of motor vehicle or NRLM diesel fuel produced or 
imported and subject to the 15 ppm sulfur content standard, or ECA marine fuel subject 
to the 1,000 ppm sulfur content standard. Batch, for the purposes of this section, means 
batch as defined under §80.2 but without the reference to transfer of custody from one 
facility to another facility. 
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the refiner or importer shall test each 
sample collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to determine its sulfur content 
for compliance with the requirements of this subpart prior to the diesel fuel leaving the 
refinery or import facility, using an appropriate sampling and testing method as specified 
in §80.580. 
(c)(1) Any refiner who produces motor vehicle, NRLM diesel fuel, or ECA marine fuel using 
computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, including the use of an on-line analyzer 
test method that is approved under the provisions of §80.580, and who, subsequent to the 
production of the diesel fuel batch tests a composited sample of the batch under the 
provisions of §80.580 for purposes of designation and reporting, is exempt from the 
requirement of paragraph (b) of this section to obtain the test result required under this 
section prior to the diesel fuel leaving the refinery, provided that the refiner obtains 
approval from EPA. The requirement of this paragraph (c)(1) that the in-line blending 
equipment must include an on-line analyzer test method that is approved under the 
provisions of §80.580 is effective beginning June 1, 2006. 
(2) To obtain an exemption from paragraph (b) of this section, the refiner must 
submit to EPA all the information required under §80.65(f)(4)(i)(A). A letter 
signed by the president, chief operating or chief executive officer of the company, 
or his/her designee, stating that the information contained in the submission is 
true to the best of his/her belief must accompany any submission under this 
paragraph (c)(2). 
(3) Refiners who seek an exemption under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must 
comply with any request by EPA for additional information or any other 
requirements that EPA includes as part of the exemption. 
(4) Within 60 days of EPA's receipt of a submission under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, EPA will notify the refiner if the exemption is not approved or of any 
deficiencies in the refiner's submission, or if any additional information is 
required or other requirements are included in the exemption pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In the absence of such notification from EPA, the 
effective date of an exemption under this paragraph (c) is 60 days from EPA's 
receipt of the refiner's submission. 
 178
(5) EPA reserves the right to modify the requirements of an exemption under this 
paragraph (c), in whole or in part, at any time, if EPA determines that the refiner's 
operation does not effectively or adequately control, monitor or document the 
sulfur content of the refinery's diesel fuel production, or if EPA determines that 
any other circumstances exist which merit modification of the requirements of an 
exemption, such as advancements in the state of the art for in-line blending 
measurement which allow for additional control or more accurate monitoring or 
documentation of sulfur content. If EPA finds that a refiner provided false or 
inaccurate information in any submission required for an exemption under this 
section, upon notification from EPA, the refiner's exemption will be void ab 
initio. 
(d) All test results under this section shall be retained for five years and must be provided to 
EPA upon request. 
(e) Samples collected under this section must be retained for at least 30 days and provided to 
EPA upon request.

0.72 ppm, computed from the results of a minimum of 20 repeat tests made over 
20 days on samples taken from a single homogeneous commercially available 
diesel fuel with a sulfur content in the range of 5–15 ppm. The 20 results must be 
a series of tests with a sequential record of the analyses and no omissions. A 
laboratory facility may exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion 
is for a valid reason under good laboratory practices and it maintains records 
regarding the sample and test results and the reason for excluding them. 
(2) For motor vehicle diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard of 
§80.520(c), and for NRLM diesel fuel subject to the 500 ppm sulfur standard of

of a minimum of 20 repeat tests made over 20 days on samples taken from a 
single homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel with a sulfur content in 
the range of 200–500 ppm. The 20 results must be a series of tests with a 
sequential record of the analyses and no omissions. A laboratory facility may 
exclude a given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason 
 179
under good laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and 
test results and the reason for excluding them. 
(3) For ECA marine fuel subject to the 1,000 ppm sulfur standard of §80.510(k), of a 
standard deviation less than 18.07 ppm, computed from the results of a minimum 
of 20 repeat tests made over 20 days on samples taken from a single 
homogeneous commercially available diesel fuel with a sulfur content in the 
range of 700–1,000 ppm.  The 20 results must be a series of tests with a sequential 
record of the analyses and no omissions.  A laboratory facility may exclude a 
given sample or test result only if the exclusion is for a valid reason under good 
laboratory practices and it maintains records regarding the sample and test results 
and the reason for excluding them.

on a commercially available gravimetric sulfur standard in the range of 
100–200 ppm sulfur shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by 
more than 7.26 ppm sulfur; 
(ii) The arithmetic average of a continuous series of at least 10 tests performed 
on a commercially available gravimetric sulfur standard in the range of 
400–500 ppm sulfur shall not differ from the ARV of that standard by 
more than 7.26 ppm sulfur; and 
(iii) In applying the tests of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section,

§ 80.585 What is the process for approval of a test method for determining the sulfur 
content of diesel or ECA marine fuel? 
(a) Approval of test methods approved by voluntary consensus-based standards bodies.  For 
such a method to be approved, the following information must be submitted to the 
Administrator by each test facility for each test method that it wishes to have approved: 
Any test method approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body, such as the 
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) or International Standards 
Organization (ISO), shall be approved as a test method for determining the sulfur content 
of diesel fuel if it meets the applicable accuracy and precision criteria under §80.584. The 
approval of a test method is limited to the single test facility that performed the testing for 
accuracy and precision. The individual facility must submit the accuracy and precision 
results for each method, including information on the date and time of each test 
measurement used to demonstrate precision, following procedures established by the 
Administrator. 
(b) Approval of test methods not approved by a voluntary consensus-based standards body.  
For such a method to be approved, the following information must be submitted to the 
Administrator by each test facility for each test method that it wishes to have approved: 
(1) Full test method documentation, including a description of the technology and/or 
instrumentation that makes the method functional. 
(2) Information demonstrating that the test method meets the applicable accuracy and 
precision criteria of §80.584, including information on the date and time of each 
test measurement used to demonstrate precision. 
(3) If requested by the Administrator, test results from use of the method to analyze 
samples of commercially available fuel provided by EPA. 
(4) Any additional information requested by the Administrator and necessary to 
render a decision as to approval of the test method. 
(c) Sample retention.  Samples used for precision and accuracy determination must be 
retained for 90 days. 
(d) EPA approval. 
(1) Within 90 days of receipt of all materials required to be submitted under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Administrator shall determine whether the 
test method is approved under this section. 
(2) If the Administrator denies approval of the test method, within 90 days of receipt 
of all materials required to be submitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, 
the Administrator will notify the applicant of the reasons for not approving the 
method. If the Administrator does not notify the applicant within 90 days of 
 181
receipt of the application, that the test method is not approved, then the test 
method shall be deemed approved. 
(3) If the Administrator finds that an individual test facility has provided false or 
inaccurate information under this section, upon notice from the Administrator the 
approval shall be void ab initio. 
(4) The approval of any test method under paragraph (b) of this section shall be valid 
for five years from the date of approval by the Administrator and shall not be 
extended. If the method is later approved by a voluntary consensus-based 
standards body, the approval shall remain valid as long as the conditions of 
paragraph (a) of this section are met. 
(e) Quality assurance procedures for sulfur measurement instrumentation.  A test shall not be 
considered a test using an approved test method unless the following quality control 
procedures are performed separately for each instrument used to make measurements: 
(1) Follow all mandatory provisions of ASTM D 6299–02 and construct control 
charts from the mandatory quality control testing prescribed in paragraph 7.1 of 
the reference method, following guidelines under A 1.5.1 for individual 
observation charts and A 1.5.2 for moving range charts. The Director of the 
Federal Register approved the incorporation by reference of ASTM D 6299–02, 
Standard Practice for Applying Statistical Quality Assurance Techniques to 
Evaluate Analytical Measurement System Performance, as prescribed in 5 U.S.C.

(2) [Reserved] 
(b) Volume balance for motor vehicle diesel fuel. 
(1) A facility's motor vehicle diesel fuel volume balance is calculated as follows: 
MVB = MVI −MVO − MVINVCHG 
Where: 
MVB= the volume balance for motor vehicle diesel fuel for the compliance period. 
MVI= the total volume of all batches of fuel designated as motor vehicle diesel fuel 
received for the compliance period.  Any motor vehicle diesel fuel produced by or 
imported into the facility shall also be included in this volume. 
MVO= the total volume of all batches of fuel designated as motor vehicle diesel fuel 
delivered for the compliance period. 
MVINVCHG= the total volume of 15 ppm sulfur and 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel 
fuel in inventory at the end of the compliance period minus the total volume of 15 
ppm sulfur and 500 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel in inventory at the 
beginning of the compliance period, including accounting for any corrections in 
inventory due to volume swell or shrinkage, difference in measurement 
calibration between receiving and delivering meters, and similar matters, where 
corrections that increase inventory are defined as positive. 
 
(2) Calculate the motor vehicle diesel fuel received, as follows: 
 200
MVI = MV15I + MV500I 
Where: 
MV15I= the total volume of all the batches of fuel designated as 15 ppm sulfur motor 
vehicle diesel fuel received for the compliance period.  Any motor vehicle diesel 
fuel produced by or imported into the facility shall also be included in this 
volume.  Any untaxed and undyed California diesel fuel received by a terminal 
pursuant to §80.617 (b)(1) shall be included in this volume. 
MV500I= the total volume of all batches of fuel designated as 500 ppm sulfur motor 
vehicle diesel fuel received for the compliance period.  Any motor vehicle diesel 
fuel produced by or imported into the facility shall also be included in this 
volume. 
(3) Calculate the motor vehicle diesel fuel delivered, as follows: 
MVO = MV15O + MV500O 
Where: 
MV15O= the total volume of all batches of fuel designated as 15 ppm sulfur motor 
vehicle diesel fuel and delivered during the compliance period. 
MV500O= the total volume of all batches of fuel designated as 500 ppm sulfur motor 
vehicle diesel fuel and delivered during the compliance period. 
 
(4) The neutral or positive volume balance required for purposes of compliance with 
§80.598(b)(9)(vi) and (b)(9)(vii)(A) means that the net balance of motor vehicle 
diesel fuel in inventory as of the end of the last day of the compliance period 
(MVNBE) must be greater than or equal to zero.  MVNBE is defined by the 
following equation: 
MVNBE = MV15BINV + MV500BINV + ΣMVB 
Where: 
MV15BINV= the total volume of fuel designated as 15 ppm sulfur motor vehicle diesel

diesel fuel additive subject to the requirements of §80.521(a), will not be deemed 
in violation if the person demonstrates that— 
(i) Product transfer document(s) account for the additive in the fuel found to 
be in violation, which comply with the requirements under §80.591(a), 
and indicate that the additive was in compliance with the applicable 
requirements while it was under the party's control; and 
(ii) For the additive's manufacturer or importer, test results which accurately 
establish that, when it left the party's control, the additive in the diesel fuel 
determined to be in violation did not have a sulfur content greater than or 
equal to 15 ppm. 
(A) Analysis of the additive sulfur content pursuant to this paragraph 
(a)(2) may be conducted at the time the batch was manufactured or 
imported, or on a sample of that batch which the manufacturer or 
importer retains for such purpose for a minimum of two years from 
the date the batch was manufactured or imported. 
 227
(B) After two years from the date the additive batch was manufactured 
or imported, the additive manufacturer or importer is no longer 
required to retain samples for the purpose of complying with the 
testing requirements of this paragraph (a)(2).

regard to a diesel fuel additive subject to the requirements of §80.521(b), will not 
be deemed in violation if the person demonstrates that— 
(i) The violation was not caused by the party or the party's employee or 
agent; 
(ii) Product transfer document(s) which comply with the additive information 
requirements under §80.591(b), account for the additive in the fuel found 
to be in violation, and indicate that the additive was in compliance with 
the applicable requirements while it was under the party's control; and 
(iii) For the additive's manufacturer or importer, test results which accurately 
establish that, when it left the party's control, the additive in the diesel fuel 
determined to be in violation was in conformity with the information on 
the additive product transfer document pursuant to the requirements of 
§80.591(b). The testing procedures applicable under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, also apply under this paragraph (a)(3). 
(b) Branded refiner defenses.  In the case of a violation found at a facility operating under the 
corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner or importer, or a refiner's or importer's 
marketing subsidiary, the refiner or importer must show, in addition to the defense 
elements required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that the violation was caused by: 
(1) An act in violation of law (other than the Clean Air Act or this Part 80), or an act 
of sabotage or vandalism; 
(2) The action of any refiner, importer, retailer, distributor, reseller, oxygenate 
blender, carrier, retailer or wholesale purchaser-consumer in violation of a 
contractual agreement between the branded refiner or importer and the person 
designed to prevent such action, and despite periodic sampling and testing by the 
branded refiner or importer to ensure compliance with such contractual 
obligation; or 
(3) The action of any carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the 
refiner or importer, but engaged for transportation of diesel fuel, despite 
specifications or inspections of procedures and equipment which are reasonably 
calculated to prevent such action. 
(c) Causation demonstration.  Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for any person to show 
that a violation was not caused by that person, or under paragraph (b) of this section to 
show that a violation was caused by any of the specified actions, the person must 
demonstrate by reasonably specific showing, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that 
the violation was caused or must have been caused by another person and that the person 
asserting the defense did not contribute to that other person's causation. 
(d) Quality assurance and testing program.  To demonstrate an acceptable quality assurance 
program under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, a person must present evidence of the 
following: 
 228
(1) A periodic sampling and testing program to ensure the diesel fuel or additive the 
person sold, dispensed, supplied, stored, or transported, meets the applicable 
standards and requirements, including the requirements relating to the presence of 
marker solvent yellow 124. 
(2) For those parties who, at a downstream location, blend diesel fuel additives 
subject to the requirements of §80.521(b) into fuel trucks at a truck loading rack, 
the periodic sampling and testing program required under this paragraph (d) must 
ensure, by taking into account the greater risk of noncompliance created through 
use of a high sulfur additive, that the diesel fuel into which the additive was 
blended meets the applicable standards subsequent to the blending. 
(3) On each occasion when diesel fuel or additive is found not in compliance with the 
applicable standard: 
(i) The person immediately ceases selling, offering for sale, dispensing, 
supplying, offering for supply, storing or transporting the non-complying 
product. 
(ii) The person promptly remedies the violation and the factors that caused the 
violation (for example, by removing the non-complying product from the 
distribution system until the applicable standard is achieved and taking 
steps to prevent future violations of a similar nature from occurring). 
(4) For any carrier who transports diesel fuel or additive in a tank truck, the quality 
assurance program required under this paragraph (d) need not include its own 
periodic sampling and testing of the diesel fuel or additive in the tank truck, but in 
lieu of such tank truck sampling and testing, the carrier shall demonstrate 
evidence of an oversight program for monitoring compliance with the 
requirements of this subpart relating to the transport or storage of such product by 
tank truck, such as appropriate guidance to drivers regarding compliance with the 
applicable sulfur standard, product segregation and product transfer document 
requirements, and the periodic review of records received in the ordinary course 
of business concerning diesel fuel or additive quality and delivery.

§1033.30 Submission of information. 
(a) This part includes various requirements to record data or other information.  Refer to 
§1033.925 and 40 CFR 1068.25 regarding recordkeeping requirements.  If recordkeeping 
requirements are not specified, store these records in any format and on any media and keep 
them readily available for one year after you send an associated application for certification, or 
one year after you generate the data if they do not support an application for certification.  You 
must promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them.  We may review 
them at any time. 
(b) The regulations in §1033.255 and 40 CFR 1068.101 describe your obligation to report 
truthful and complete information and the consequences of failing to meet this obligation.  This 
includes information not related to certification.   
(c) Send all reports and requests for approval to the Designated Compliance Officer (see 
§1033.901). 
(d) Any written information we require you to send to or receive from another company is 
deemed to be a required record under this section.  Such records are also deemed to be 
submissions to EPA.  We may require you to send us these records whether or not you are a 
certificate holder.

would increase a locomotive’s emissions of any regulated pollutant.  This includes components 
listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to 
control emissions.  The emission-related warranty covers the components you sell even if 
another company produces the component.  Your emission-related warranty does not cover 
components whose failure would not increase a locomotive’s emissions of any regulated 
pollutant.  For remanufactured locomotives, your emission-related warranty does not cover used 
parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture.For remanufactured locomotives, your 
emission-related warranty is required to cover only those parts that you supply or those parts for 
which you specify allowable part manufacturers.  It does not need to cover used parts that are not 
replaced during the remanufacture.

(4) Estimate costs as described in this paragraph (a)(4). 
(i) The cost limits described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are specified in terms of 
2007 dollars.  Adjust these values for future years according to the following equation: 
Actual Limit = (2007 Limit) Η [ (0.6000)Η(Commodity Index) + (0.4000)Η(Earnings Index) 
Where: 
2007 Limit = The value specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section ($250,000 or $125,000). 
Commodity Index = The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index for Industrial 
Commodities Less Fuel (Series WPU03T15M05) for the month prior to the date you 
submit your application divided by 173.1.  
Earnings Index = The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Estimated Average Hourly Earnings of 
Production Workers for Durable Manufacturing (Series CES3100000008) for the month 
prior to the date you submit your application divided by 18.26. 
 
(ii) Calculate all costs in current dollars (for the month prior to the date you submit your 
application).  Calculate fuel costs based on a fuel price adjusted by the Association of 
American Railroads’ monthly railroad fuel price index (P), which is available at 
https://www.aar.org/PubCommon/Documents/AboutTheIndustry/Index_MonthlyFuelPric
es.pdforg/~/media/AAR/RailCostIndexes/Index_MonthlyFuelPrices.ashx.  (Use the value 
for the column in which P equals 539.8 for November 2007.)  Calculate a new fuel price

a  Applicable standards are calculated from n (maximum in-use engine speed, in RPM), 
rounded to one decimal place.  
b  Tier 1 NOx standards apply as specified in 40 CFR part 94 for engines originally 
manufactured in model years 2004 through 2010.  They are shown here only for 
reference. 
 
(3) The HC standard for Tier 2 and later engines is 2.0 g/kW-hr.  This standard applies as 
 253
follows: 
(i) Alcohol-fueled engines must comply with HC standards based on THCE emissions. 
(ii) Natural gas-fueled engines must comply with HC standards based on NMHC 
emissions. 
(iii) Diesel-fueled and all other engines not described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this 
section must comply with HC standards based on THC emissions. 
(4) The CO standard for Tier 2 and later engines is 5.0 g/kW-hr. 
(b) Averaging, banking, and trading.  Category 3 engines are not eligible for participation in the 
averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program as described in subpart H of this part. 
(c) Mode caps.  Measured NOx emissions may not exceed the cap specified in this paragraph (c) 
for any applicable duty-cycle test modes with power greater than 10 percent maximum engine 
power.  Calculate the mode cap by multiplying the applicable NOx standard by 1.5 and rounding 
to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr.  Note that mode caps do not apply for pollutants other than NOx and 
do not apply for any modes of operation outside of the applicable duty-cycles in §1042.505.  
Category 3 engines are not subject to not-to-exceed standards. 
(d) Useful life. Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards of this section over their 
full useful life, expressed as a period in years or hours of engine operation, whichever comes 
first. 
(1) The minimum useful life value is 3 years or 10,000 hours of operation. 
(2) Specify a longer useful life in hours for an engine family under either of two conditions: 
(i) If you design, advertise, or market your engine to operate longer than the minimum 
useful life (your recommended hours until rebuild indicates a longer design life). 
(ii) If your basic mechanical warranty is longer than the minimum useful life.  
(e) Applicability for testing.  The duty-cycle emission standards in this section apply to all 
testing performed according to the procedures in §1042.505, including certification, production-
line, and in-use testing.  See paragraph (g) of this section for standards that apply for certain 
other test procedures.  
(f) Domestic engines.  Engines installed on vessels excluded from 40 CFR part 1043 because 
they operate only domestically may not be certified for use with residual fuels. 
(g) At-sea standards.  Measured NOx emissions may not exceed the standard specified in this 
paragraph (g) for test of engines installed on vessels where the duty-cycle test modes must be 
approximated.  Calculate the at-sea standard by multiplying the applicable NOx standard by 1.1 
and rounding to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr. 
 
64.  Section 1042.110 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) and adding paragraph 
(d) to read as follows: 
§1042.110  Recording reductant use and other diagnostic functions. 
(a) * * * 
(2) The onboard computer log must record in nonvolatile computer memory all incidents of 
engine operation with inadequate reductant injection or reductant quality.  Use good 
engineering judgment to ensure that the operator can readily access the information to submit 
the report required by §1042.660.  For example, you may meet this requirement by 
documenting the incident in a text file that can be downloaded or printed by the operator.  
* * * * * 
(d) For Category 3 engines equipped with on-off controls (as allowed by §1042.115(g)), you 
must also equip your engine to continuously monitor NOx concentrations in the exhaust.  Use 
 254
good engineering judgment to alert operators if measured NOx concentrations indicate 
malfunctioning emission controls.  Record any such operation in nonvolatile computer memory.  
You are not required to monitor NOx concentrations during operation for which the emission 
controls may be disabled under §1042.115(g).  For the purpose of this paragraph (d), 
“malfunctioning emission controls” means any condition in which the measured NOx 
concentration exceeds the value expected when the engine is in compliance with the at-sea 
standard of §1042.104(g).  Determine these expected values during production-line testing of the 
engine, using linear interpolation between test points.  You may also use additional intermediate 
test points measured during the production-line test.  
 
65.  Section 1042.115 is amended by revising paragraph (d)(2) introductory text and 
adding paragraphs (f)(4) and (g) to read as follows: 
§1042.115  Other requirements. 
* * * * * 
(d) * * * 
(2) Category 2 and Category 3 engines that have adjustable parameters must meet all the 
requirements of this part for any adjustment in the specified adjustable range.  You must 
specify in your application for certification the adjustable range of each adjustable parameter 
on a new engine to–  
* * * * * 
(f)  * * * 
(4) The engine is a Category 3 engine and the AECD conforms to the requirements of 
paragraph (g) of this section. 
(g) On-off controls for Category 3 engines.  Manufacturers may equip Category 3 engines with 
features that disable Tier 3 emission controls subject to the following provisions: 
(1) Features that disable Tier 3 emission controls are considered to be AECDs whether or not 
they meet the definition of an AECD.  For example, manually operated on-off features are 
AECDs under this paragraph (g).  The features must be identified in your application for 
certification as AECDs. 
(2)  If IMO has not established an ECA for US waters, you must demonstrate that the AECD 
will not disable emission controls while operating in areas where emissions could reasonably 
be expected to adversely affect U.S. air quality.  If ECAs have been established for U.S. 
waters , then you must demonstrate that the AECD will not disable emission control while 
operating in waters within the outer boundaries of the ECAs.  (Note: See the regulations in 
40 CFR part 1043 for requirements related to operation in other ECAs.)  Compliance with 
this paragraph will generally require that the AECD operation be based on Global 
Positioning System (GPS) inputs.  We may consider any relevant information to determine 
whether your AECD conforms to this paragraph (g). 
(3) The onboard computer log must record in nonvolatile computer memory all incidents of 
engine operation with the Tier 3 emission controls disabled. 
(4) The engine must comply fully with the Tier 2 standards when the Tier 3 emission controls 
are disabled. 
 
 
66.  Section 1042.120 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) to read as 
follows: 
 255
§1042.120  Emission-related warranty requirements. 
(b) * * * 
(2) [Reserved]For Category 3 engines, your emission-related warranty must be valid 
throughout the engine’s full useful life as specified in §1042.104(d). 
* * * * * 
(c) Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure 
would increase an engine’s emissions of any regulated pollutant, including thosecomponents 
listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and thosecomponents from any other system you 
develop to control emissions.  The emission-related warranty for freshly manufactured marine 
engines covers these components even if another company produces the component.  Your 
emission-related warranty does not cover components whose failure would not increase an 
engine’s emissions of any regulated pollutant. For remanufactured engines, your emission-
related warranty does not cover used parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture.For 
remanufactured engines, your emission-related warranty is required to cover only those parts that 
you supply or those parts for which you specify allowable part manufacturers.  It does not need 
to cover used parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture. 
* * * * * 
 
67.  Section 1042.125 is amended by revising the heading, introductory text, and 
paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (d) to read as follows: 
§1042.125  Maintenance instructions for Category 1 and Category 2 engines. 
Give the ultimate purchaser of each new engine written instructions for properly maintaining and 
using the engine, including the emission control system, as described in this section.  The 
maintenance instructions also apply to service accumulation on your emission-data engines as 
described in §1042.245 and in 40 CFR part 1065.  ThisThe restrictions specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section appliesrelated to allowable maintenance apply only to Category 1 
and Category 2 engines.  Manufacturers may specify any maintenance for Category 3 engines. 
(a) * * * 
(1) * * * 
(iii) You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in your maintenance 
instructions for the customer. 
* * * * * 
(d) Noncritical emission-related maintenance.  Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d), 
you may schedule any amount of emission-related inspection or maintenance that is not covered 
by paragraph (a) of this section (that is, maintenance that is neither explicitly identified as critical 
emission-related maintenance, nor that we approve as critical emission-related maintenance).  
Noncritical emission-related maintenance generally includes maintenance on the components we 
specify in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I that is not covered in paragraph (a) of this section.  You 
must state in the owners manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related 
warranty valid.  If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify 
those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim.  Do not take these inspection or 
maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines. 
* * * * * 
 
68.  Section 1042.135 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(5), (c)(8), (c)(9), and 
(c)(11) and adding paragraph (c)(12)  to read as follows: 
 256
§1042.135  Labeling. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
 
(5) State the date of manufacture [DAY (optional), MONTH, and YEAR].  H; however, you 
may omit this from the label if you stamp or, engrave, or otherwise permanently identify it 
elsewhere on the engine, in which case you must also describe in your application for 
certification where you will identify the date on the engine. 
* * * * * 
(8) State the useful life for your engine family if the applicable useful life is based on the 
provisions of §1042.101(e)(2) or (3), or §1042.104(d)(2). 
(9)  Identify the emission control system.  Use terms and abbreviations consistent with SAE 
J1930 (incorporated by referenceas described in §1042.910)40 CFR 1068.45.  You may omit 
this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners 
manual instead. 
* * * * * 
(11) For ana Category 1 or Category 2 engine that can be modified to operate on residual 
fuel, but has not been certified to meet the standards on such a fuel, include the statement: 
"THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED FOR OPERATION ONLY WITH DIESEL FUEL. 
MODIFYING THE ENGINE TO OPERATE ON RESIDUAL OR INTERMEDIATE FUEL 
MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES.". 
(12) For an engine equipped with on-off emissions controls as allowed by §1042.115, include 
the statement: "THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED WITH ON-OFF EMISSION CONTROLS.  
OPERATION CONTRARY TO THE CERTIFICATE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF 
FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES.". 
* * * * * 
 
69.  Section 1042.140 is amended by revising the heading and introductory text and 
adding paragraph (g) to read as follows: 
§1042.140  Maximum engine power, displacement, and power density, and maximum in-
use engine speed. 
This section describes how to determine the maximum engine power, displacement, and power 
density of an engine for the purposes of this part.  Note that maximum engine power may differ 
from the definition of “maximum test power” in §1042.901.  This section also specifies how to 
determine maximum in-use engine speed for Category 3 engines. 
* * * * * 
(g) Calculate a maximum test speed for the nominal power curve as specified in 40 CFR 
1065.610.  This is the maximum in-use engine speed used for calculating the NOx standard in 
§1042.104 for Category 3 engines.  Alternatively, you may use a lower value if engine speed will 
be limited in actual use to that lower value. 
 
70.  Section 1042.145 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and the heading of 
paragraph (c) introductory text and adding paragraph (h) to read as follows: 
§1042.145  Interim provisions. 
(a) General.  The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part for 
Category 1 and Category 2 engines.  This section describes when these interim provisions expire.  
 257
Only the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section apply for Category 3 engines. 
* * * * * 
(c) Part 1065 test procedures for Category 1 and Category 2 engines. *
 
*
 
* 
* * * * * 
(h) The following interim provisions apply for Category 3 engines: 
(1) Applicability of Tier 3 standards to Category 3 engines operating in Alaska, Hawaii, and 
U.S. Pacific territories.    
(i) Category 3 engines are not required to comply with the Tier 3 NOx standard when 
operating in areas of Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands.  Category 3 engines are also not required to comply with the Tier 3 NOx 
standards when operating in the waters of the smallest Hawaiian islands or in the waters 
of Alaska west of Kodiak.  For the purpose of this paragraph (h)(1), “the smallest 
Hawaiian islands” includes all Hawaiian islands other than Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Kauai, 
Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Niihau, and Oahu.  Engines must comply fully with the 
appropriate Tier 2 NOx standard and all other applicable requirements when operating in 
the areas identified in this paragraph (h)(1). 
(ii) The provisions of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section do not apply for areas included in 
an ECA.  The Tier 3 standards apply in full for any area included in an ECA. 
(2)  Part 1065 test procedures. You must generally use the test procedures specified in 
subpart F of this part for Category 3 engines, including the applicable test procedures in 40 
CFR part 1065.  You may use a combination of the test procedures specified in this part and 
the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 94 before January 1, 2016 without request.  
After this date, you must use test procedures only as specified in subpart F of this part.  
 
Subpart C—[Amended] 
 
71.  Section 1042.201 is amended by revising paragraph (h) to read as follows: 
§1042.201  General requirements for obtaining a certificate of conformity. 
* * * * * 
(h) For engines that become new as a result of substantial modifications or forafter being placed 
into service, such as engines installed on imported vessels that become subject to the 
requirements of this part, we may specify alternate certification provisions consistent with the 
intent of this part.  See the definition of “new marine engine” in §1042.901. 
 
 
72.  Section 1042.205 is amended by adding paragraph (b)(12) and revising 
paragraphs (i), (o), and (s)(5) to read as follows: 
§1042.205  Application requirements. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(12) Include any other information required by this part with respect to AECDs.  For 
example, see §1042.115 for requirements related to on-off technologies. 
 258
* * * * * 
(i) Include the maintenance and warranty instructions you will give to the ultimate purchaser of 
each new engine (see §§1042.120 and 1042.125).  Describe your plan for meeting warranty 
obligations under §§1042§1042.120. 
* * * * * 
(o) Present emission data for HC, NOx, PM, and CO on an emission-data engine to show your 
engines meet emission standards as specified in §1042§§1042.101 or 1042.104.  Note that you 
must submit PM data for all engines, whether or not a PM standard applies.  Show emission 
figures before and after applying adjustment factors for regeneration and deterioration factors for 
each pollutant and for each engine.  If we specify more than one grade of any fuel type (for 
example, high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuel), you need to submit test data only for one grade, 
unless the regulations of this part specify otherwise for your engine.  Include emission results for 
each mode for Category 3 engines or for other engines if you do discrete-mode testing under 
§1042.505.  Note that §§1042.235 and 1042.245 allows you to submit an application in certain 
cases without new emission data. 
* * * * * 
(s) * * * 
(5) For Category 2 and Category 3 engines, propose a range of adjustment for each adjustable 
parameter, as described in §1042.115(d).  Include information showing why the limits, stops, 
or other means of inhibiting adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters 
on in-use engines to settings outside your proposed adjustable ranges.  
* * * * * 
 
73.  Section 1042.220 is revised to read as follows: 
§1042.220  Amending maintenance instructions. 
You may amend your emission-related maintenance instructions after you submit your 
application for certification, as long as the amended instructions remain consistent with the 
provisions of §1042.125.  You must send the Designated Compliance Officer a written request to 
amend your application for certification for an engine family if you want to change the emission-
related maintenance instructions in a way that could affect emissions.  In your request, describe 
the proposed changes to the maintenance instructions.  We will approve your request if we 
determine that the amended instructions are consistent with maintenance you performed on 
emission-data engines such that your durability demonstration would remain valid.  If operators 
follow the original maintenance instructions rather than the newly specified maintenance, this 
does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. 
(a) If you are decreasing , replacing  or eliminating or any specified maintenance, you may 
distribute the new maintenance instructions to your customers 30 days after we receive your 
request, unless we disapprove your request.  This would generally include replacing one 
maintenance step with another.  We may approve a shorter time or waive this requirement. 
(b) If your requested change would not decrease the specified maintenance, you may distribute 
the new maintenance instructions anytime after you send your request.  For example, this 
paragraph (b) would cover adding instructions to increase the frequency of a maintenance 
stepfilter changes for engines in severe-duty applications. 
(c) You do not need tonot request approval if you are making only minor corrections (such as 
correcting typographical mistakes), clarifying your maintenance instructions, or changing 
instructions for maintenance unrelated to emission control.  We may ask you to send us copies of 
 259
maintenance instructions revised under this paragraph (c). 
 
74.  Section 1042.225 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2), (e), and (f) to read as 
follows: 
§1042.225  Amending applications for certification. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended engine family 
complies with all applicable requirements.  You may do this by showing that the original 
emission-data engine is still appropriate with respect tofor showing compliance ofthat the 
amended family complies with all applicable requirements. 
* * * * * 
(e) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, you may start producing 
the new or modified engine configuration anytime after you send us your amended application 
and before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section.  However, if we determine 
that the affected engines do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease 
production of the engines and may require you to recall the engines at no expense to the owner.  
Choosing to produce engines under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all 
engines that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and 
to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner.  If you do not provide information 
required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days after we request it, you must stop 
producing the new or modified engines. 
(f) You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in certain cases after the start of production.  
The changed FEL may not apply to engines you have already introduced into U.S. commerce, 
except as described in this paragraph (f).  If we approve a changed FEL after the start of 
production, you must include the new FEL on the emission control information label for all 
engines produced after the change.  You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in the 
following cases: 
(1) You may ask to raise your FEL for your emission family at any time.  In your request, 
you must show that you will still be able to meet the emission standards as specified in 
subparts B and H of this part.  If you amend your application by submitting new test data to 
include a newly added or modified engine or fuel-system component, as described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production 
volumes to calculate your production-weighted average FELemission credits for the model 
year, as described in subpart H of this part.  If you amend your application without 
submitting new test dataIn all other circumstances, you must use the higher FEL for the 
entire family to calculate your production-weighted average FELemission credits under 
subpart H of this part. 
(2) You may ask to lower the FEL for your emission family only if you have test data from 
production engines showing that emissions are below the proposed lower FEL.  The lower 
FEL applies only to engines you produce after we approve the new FEL.  Use the appropriate 
FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate your production-weighted average 
FELemission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part. 
 
75.  Section 1042.230 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (d), (f) introductory text, 
and (g) to read as follows: 
 260
§1042.230  Engine families. 
(a) For purposes of certification, divide your product line into families of engines that are 
expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout the useful life as described in this 
section.  You may not group Category 1 and Category 2 enginesengines in different engine 
categories in the same family.  Your engine family is limited to a single model year. 
* * * * * 
(d) [Reserved]For Category 3 engines, group engines into engine families based on the criteria 
specified in Section 4.3 of the Annex VI Technical Code (incorporated by reference in 
§1042.910), except as allowed in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. 
* * * * * 
(f) You may group engines that are not identical with respect to the things listed in paragraph (b), 
(c), or (cd) of this section in the same engine family, as follows: 
* * * * * 
(g) If you combine engines that are subject to different emission standards into a single engine 
family under paragraph (f) of this section, you must certify the engine family to the more 
stringent set of standards for that model year.  For Category 3 engine families that include a 
range of maximum in-use engine speeds, use the highest value of maximum in-use engine speed 
to establish the applicable NOx emission standard. 
 
76.  Section 1042.235 is amended by revising the introductory text and paragraphs (a), 
(b), (c), and (d) introductory text to read as follows: 
§1042.235  Emission testing required for a certificate of conformity. 
This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the 
emission standards in §1042.101(a) or 1042.104.  See §1042.205(p) regarding emission testing 
related to the NTE standards.  See §§1042.240 and 1042.245 and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, 
regarding service accumulation before emission testing.  See §1042.655 for special testing 
provisions available for Category 3 engines subject to Tier 3 standards. 
(a) Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing.  For engines at or above 
560 kW, you may use a development engine that is equivalent in design to the engine being 
certified.  For Category 3 engines, you may use a single-cylinder version of the engine.  Using 
good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration most likely to exceed an applicable 
emission standard over the useful life, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the 
range of installation options available to vessel manufacturers. 
(b) Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in subpart F of 
this part.  
(c) We may measure emissions from any of your testemission-data engines or other engines from 
the engine family, as follows: 
(1) We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility.  If we do this, you 
must deliver the test engine to a test facility we designate.  The test engine you provide must 
include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other 
emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block.  If we do the 
testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the 
instruments, personnel, and equipment we need. 
(2) If we measure emissions from one of your test engines, the results of that testing become 
the official emission results for the engine.  Unless we later invalidate these data, we may 
decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable 
 261
requirements. 
(3) Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point 
within the specified adjustable ranges (see §1042.115(d)). 
(4) Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production 
tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter.  For example, this would 
apply where we determine that an engine parameter is not an adjustable parameter (as 
defined in §1042.901) but that it is subject to production variability. 
(d) You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model year instead of doing 
new tests, but only if all the following are true: 
* * * * * 
 
77.  Section 1042.240 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) introductory 
text and adding paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
§1042.240  Demonstrating compliance with exhaust emission standards. 
(a) For purposes of certification, your engine family is considered in compliance with the 
emission standards in §1042.101(a) or §1042.104 if all emission-data engines representing that 
family have test results showing deteriorated emission levels at or below these standards.  This 
includes all test points over the course of the durability demonstration.  Note that your FELs are 
considered to be the applicable emission standards with which you must comply if you 
participate in the ABT program in subpart H of this part. 
(b) Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that 
family has test results showing a deteriorated emission level for any pollutant that is above an 
applicable emission standard for any pollutant.  This includes all test points over the course of 
the durability demonstration. 
(c) To compare emission levels from the emission-data engine with the applicable emission 
standards for Category 1 and Category 2 engines, apply deterioration factors to the measured 
emission levels for each pollutant.  Section 1042.245 specifies how to test your Category 1 or 
Category 2 engine to develop deterioration factors that represent the deterioration expected in 
emissions over your engines’ full useful life.  See paragraph (e) of this section for determining 
deterioration factors for Category 3 engines.  Your deterioration factors must take into account 
any available data from in-use testing with similar engines.  Small-volume engine manufacturers 
and post-manufacture marinizers may use assigned deterioration factors that we establish.  Apply 
deterioration factors as follows: 
* * * * * 
(e) For Category 3 engines, determine a deterioration factor based on an engineering analysis.  
The engineering analysis must describe how the measured emission levels from the emission-
data engine show that engines comply with applicable emission standards throughout the useful 
life.  Include this analysis in your application for certification and add a statement that all data, 
analyses, evaluations, and other information you used are available for our review upon request. 
 
78.  Section 1042.245 is amended by revising the introductory text and paragraph (a) 
to read as follows: 
§1042.245  Deterioration factors. 
For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, eEstablish deterioration factors, as described in 
§1042.240,  to determine whether your engines will meet emission standards for each pollutant 
throughout the useful life.  This section describes how to determine deterioration factors for 
 262
Category 1 and Category 2 engines, either with an engineering analysis, with pre-existing test 
data, or with new emission measurements.  This section does not apply for Category 3 engines. 
(a) You may ask us to approve deterioration factors for an engine family with established 
technology based on engineering analysis instead of testing.  Engines certified to a NOx+HC 
standard or FEL greater than the Tier 3 NOx+HC standard are considered to rely on established 
technology for control of gaseous emission controlemissions, except that this does not include 
any engines that use exhaust-gas recirculation or aftertreatment.  In most cases, technologies 
used to meet the Tier 1 and Tier 2 emission standards would be considered to bequalify as 
established technology.  We must approve your plan to establish a deterioration factor under this 
paragraph (a) before you submit your application for certification. 
* * * * * 
 
79.  Section 1042.250 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c) and removing 
paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
§1042.250  Recordkeeping and reporting. 
(a) If you produce engines under any provisions of this part that are related to production 
volumes, sendSend the Designated Compliance Officer information related to a report within 30 
days after the end of the model year describing the total number of engines you produced in each 
engine family.  For example, if you use special provisions intended for small-volume engine 
manufacturers, report your U.S.-directed production volumes to show that you do not exceed the 
applicable limitsas described in §1042.345. In addition, within 45 days after the end of the model 
year, you must send us a report describing information about engines you produced during the 
model year as follows: 
(1) State the total production volume for each engine family that is not subject to reporting 
under §1042.345. 
(2) State the total production volume for any engine family for which you produce engines 
after completing the reports required in §1042.345. 
* * * * * 
(c) Keep data from routine emission tests (such as test cell temperatures and relative humidity 
readings) for one year after we issue the associated certificate of conformity.  Keep all other 
information specified in paragraph (a) of this section for eight years after we issue your 
certificate. 
* * * * * 
(e) [Reserved] 
 
80.  Section 1042.255 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 
§1042.255  EPA decisions.

(b) We may deny your application for certification if we determine that your engine family fails 
to comply with emission standards or other requirements of this part or the Clean Air Act.  We 
will base Oour decision may be based on a review of allall available information available to us.  
If we deny your application, we will explain why in writing.

81.  Section 1042.301 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(2), (c), (e), and (f) to 
read as follows: 
§1042.301  General provisions. 
(a) * * * 
(2) We may exempt Category 1 engine families with a projected U.S.-directed production 
volume below 100 engines from routine testing under this subpart.  Request this exemption 
in your application for certification and include your basis for projecting a production 
volume below 100 units.  We will approve your request if we agree that you have made 
good-faith estimates of your production volumes.  Your exemption is approved when we 
grant your certificate. You must promptly notify us if your actual production exceeds 100 
units during the model year.  If you exceed the production limit or if there is evidence of a 
nonconformity, we may require you to test production-line engines under this subpart, or 
under 40 CFR part 1068, subpart DE, even if we have approved an exemption under this 
paragraph (a)(2). 
* * * * * 
(c) Other requirements apply to engines that you produce.  Other regulatory provisions authorize 
us to suspend, revoke, or void your certificate of conformity, or order recalls for engine families, 
without regard to whether they have passed these production-line testing requirements.  The 
requirements of this subpart do not affect our ability to do selective enforcement audits, as 
described in 40 CFR part 1068.  Individual engines in families that pass these  production-line 
testing requirements must also conform to all applicable regulations of this part and 40 CFR part 
1068. 
* * * * * 
(e) If you certify ana Category 1 or Category 2 engine family with carryover emission data, as 
described in §1042.235(d), and these equivalent engine families consistently pass the production-
line testing requirements over the preceding two-year period, you may ask for a reduced testing 
rate for further production-line testing for that family.  The minimum testing rate is one engine 
per engine family.  If we reduce your testing rate, we may limit our approval to any number of 
model years.  In determining whether to approve your request, we may consider the number of 
engines that have failed the emission tests. 
(f) We may ask you to make a reasonable number of production-line engines available for a 
reasonable time so we can test or inspect them for compliance with the requirements of this part.  
See 40 CFR 1068.27.For Category 3 engines, you are not required to deliver engines to us, but 
we may inspect and test your engines at any facility at which they are assembled or installed in 
vessels. 
 
82.  A new §1042.302 is added to subpart D to read as follows: 
§1042.302  Applicability of this subpart for Category 3 engines. 
If you produce Category 3 engines that are subject to the requirements of this part, you must test 
them as described in this subpart, except as specified in this section. 
(a) You must test each engine at the sea trial of the vessel in which it is installed or within the 
first 300 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. Since you must test each engine, the 
provisions of §§1042.310 and 1042.315(b) do not apply for Category 3 engines.  If we determine 
that an engine failure under this subpart is caused by defective components or design 
deficiencies, we may revoke or suspend your certificate for the engine family as described in 
§1042.340.  If we determine that an engine failure under this subpart is caused only by incorrect 
 264
assembly, we may suspend your certificate for the engine family as described in §1042.325.   
(b) You are only required to measure NOx emissions.  You do not need to measure HC, CO or 
PM emissions under this subpart.   
(c) If you are unable to operate the engine at the test points for the specified duty cycle, you may 
approximate these points consistent with the specifications of section 6 of Appendix 8 to the 
NOx Technical Code and show compliance with the at-sea standard of §104(g). 
(d) You may measure NOx emissions at additional test points for the purposes of the continuous 
NOx monitoring requirements of §1042.110(d).  If you do, you must report these values along 
with your other test results. 
(e) You may ask to measure emissions according to the Direct Measurement and Monitoring 
method specified in section 6.4 of the NOx Technical Code. 
 
83.  Section 1042.305 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (d) introductory text, 
(d)(2), (e)(2), and (g) to read as follows: 
§1042.305  Preparing and testing production-line engines. 
* * * * * 
(a) Test procedures.  Test your production-line engines using the applicable testing procedures in 
subpart F of this part to show you meet the duty-cycle emission standards in subpart B of this 
part.  TFor Category 1 and Category 2 engines, the not-to-exceed standards apply for this testing 
of Category 1 and Category 2 engines, but you need not do additional testing to show that 
production-line engines meet the not-to-exceed standards.  The mode cap standards apply for the 
testing of Category 3 engines. 
* * * * * 
(d) Setting adjustable parameters.  Before any test, we may require you to adjust any adjustable 
parameter on a Category 1 engine to any setting within its physically adjustable range.  We may 
adjust or require you to adjust any adjustable parameter on a Category 2 or Category 3 engine to 
any setting within its specified adjustable range. 
* * * * * 
(2)  We may specify adjustments within the physically adjustable range or the specified 
adjustable range by considering their effect on emission levels, as well as.  We may also 
consider how likely it is that someone will make such an adjustment with in-use engines. 
(e)  * * * 
(2) For Category 2 or Category 3 engines, you may ask us to approve a Green Engine Factor 
for each regulated pollutant for each engine family.  Use the Green Engine Factor to adjust 
measured emission levels to establish a stabilized low-hour emission level.  
* * * * * 
(g) Retesting after invalid tests.  You may retest an engine if you determine an emission test is 
invalid under subpart F of this part.  Explain in your written report reasons for invalidating any 
test and the emission results from all tests.  If you retest an engine, you may ask us to 
substitutewe determine that you improperly invalidated a test, we may require you to ask for our 
approval for future testing before substituting results of the new tests for the originalinvalid ones.  
You must ask us within ten days of testing.  We will generally answer within ten days after we 
receive your information. 
 
84.  Section 1042.310 is amended by revising the heading to read as follows: 
§1042.310  Engine selection for Category 1 and Category 2 engines.

85.  Section 1042.315 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as 
follows: 
§1042.315  Determining compliance. 
* * * * * 
(a) Calculate your test results as follows:   
(1) Initial and final test results.  Calculate and round the test results for each engine.  If you 
do several tests on an engine, calculate the initial results for each test, then add all the test 
results, then add them together and divide by the number of tests.  Round this final calculated 
value for the final test results on that engine.  Include the Green Engine Factor to determine 
low-hour emission results, if applicable. 
(2) Final deteriorated test results.  Apply the deterioration factor for the engine family to the 
final test results (see §1042.240(c)). 
(3) Round deteriorated test results.  Round the results to the number of decimal places in the 
emission standard expressed to one more decimal place than the applicable emission. 
(b) IFor Category 1 and Category 2 engines, if a production-line engine fails to meet emission 
standards and you test two additional engines as described in §1042.310, calculate the average 
emission level for each pollutant for the three engines.  If the calculated average emission level 
for any pollutant exceeds the applicable emission standard, the engine family fails the 
production-line testing requirements of this subpart.  Tell us within ten working days if this 
happens.  You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the FEL of the 
engine family as described in §1042.225(f). 
 
86.  Section 1042.320 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(2) to read as follows: 
§1042.320  What happens if one of my production-line engines fails to meet emission 
standards? 
(a) * * * 
(2)  Include in your written report a description of the test results and describe the remedy for 
each engine (see in the written report required under §1042.345). 
* * * * * 
 
87.  Section 1042.325 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
§1042.325  What happens if an engine family fails the production-line testing 
requirements? 
* * * * * 
(e) You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the FEL of the entire 
engine family before or after we suspend your certificate as described in §105142.225(f).  We 
will approve your request if the failure is not caused by a defect and it is clear that you used good 
engineering judgment in establishing the original FEL. 
 
88.  Section 1042.345 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(6) and (b) to read as 
follows: 
§1042.345  Reporting. 
(a)  * * * 
(6)  Provide the test number; the date, time and duration of testing; test procedure; all initial 
 266
test results before and after rounding; final test results; and final deteriorated test results for 
all tests.  Provide the emission results for all measured pollutants.  Include information for 
both valid and invalid tests and the reason for any invalidation. 
* * * * *. 
(b)  We may ask you to add information to your written report so we can determine whether your 
new engines conform with the requirements of this subpart.  We may also ask you to send less 
information. 
* * * * * 
89.  Section 1042.350 is amended by revising paragraphs (b), (e), and (f) to read as 
follows: 
§1042.350  Recordkeeping. 
* * * * * 
(b) Keep paper or electronic records of your production-line testing for eight years after you 
complete all the testing required for an engine family in a model year.  You may use any 
appropriate storage formats or media.  
* * * * * 
(e) If we ask, you must give us a more detailed description of projected or actual production 
figures for an engine family.  We may ask you to divide your production figures by maximum 
engine power, displacement, fuel type, or assembly plant (if you produce engines at more than 
one plant).   
(f) Keep a listrecords of the engine identification numbers for all theeach engines you produce 
under each certificate of conformity.  You may identify these numbers as a range.  Give us this 
listthese records within 30 days if we ask for itthem. 
* * * * * 
 
Subpart F—[Amended] 
 
90.  Section 1042.501 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (c) and adding 
paragraph (g) to read as follows: 
§1042.501  How do I run a valid emission test? 
(a) Use the equipment and procedures for compression-ignition engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to 
determine whether Category 1 and Category 2 engines meet the duty-cycle emission standards in 
§1042.101(a) or 1042.104.  Measure the emissions of all regulated pollutants as specified in 40 
CFR part 1065.  Use the applicable duty cycles specified in §1042.505. 
* * * * * 
(c) Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, for all the testing we 
require in this part, except as specified in this section and §1042.515. 
(1) For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is 
representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use. 
(2) For diesel-fueled engines, use the appropriate diesel fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065, 
subpart H, for emission testing.  Unless we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel 
for Category 1 and Category 2 engines is the ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel.  If we allow you to 
use a test fuel with higher sulfur levels, identify the test fuel in your application for 
certification and ensure that the emission control information label is consistent with your 
selection of the test fuel (see §1042.135(c)(11)).  Unless we specify otherwise, the 
appropriate diesel test fuel for Category 3 engines is the high-sulfur diesel fuel.  For Category 
 267
2 and Category 3 engines, you may ask to use commercially available diesel fuel similar but 
not necessarily identical to the applicable fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H; we 
will approve your request if you show us that it does not affect your ability to demonstrate 
compliance with the applicable emission standards.   
(3) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines that are expected to use a type of fuel (or mixed 
fuel) other than diesel fuel (such as natural gas, methanol, or residual fuel), use a 
commercially available fuel of that type for emission testing.  If ana given engine is designed 
to operate on different fuels, we may (at our discretion) require testing on each fuel.  Propose 
test fuel specifications that take into account the engine design and the properties of 
commercially available fuels.  Describe these test fuel specifications in the application for 
certification. 
(4) [Reserved] 
* * * * * 
(g) For Category 3 engines, you may submit test data for NOx, HC, and CO emissions that were 
collected as specified in the Annex VI Technical Code instead of test data collected as specified 
in 40 CFR part 1065.  We may require you to include a brief engineering analysis showing how 
these data demonstrate that your engines would meet the applicable emission standards if you 
had used the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065. 
 
 
91.  Section 1042.505 is amended by revising paragraph (b) introductory text to read 
as follows: 
§1042.505  Testing engines using discrete-mode or ramped-modal duty cycles. 
* * * * * 
(b) Measure emissions by testing the engine on a dynamometer with one of the following duty 
cycles (as specified) to determine whether it meets the emission standards in §1042.101(a) or 
1042.104: 
* * * * * 
 
92.  Section 1042.525 is amended by adding paragraph (g) to read as follows: 
§1042.525  How do I adjust emission levels to account for infrequently regenerating 
aftertreatment devices? 
* * * * * 
(g) Category 3 engines.  We may specify an alternate methodology to account for regeneration 
events from Category 3 engines.  If we do not, the provisions of this section apply as specified. 
 
Subpart G—[Amended] 
 
93.  Section 1042.601 is amended by revising paragraph (b) and adding paragraph (g) 
to read as follows: 
§1042.601  General compliance provisions for marine engines and vessels. 
* * * * * 
(b) Subpart I of this part describes how the prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply for 
certain remanufactured engines.  The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.105 do not allow the 
installation of a new remanufactured engine in a vessel that is defined as a new vessel unless the 
remanufactured engine is subject to the same standards as the standards applicable to freshly 
 268
manufactured engines of the required model year.   
* * * * * 
(g) The selective enforcement audit provisions of 40 CFR part 1068 do not apply for Category 3 
engines. 
 
 
94.  Section 1042.605 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§1042.605  Dressing engines already certified to other standards for nonroad or heavy-duty 
highway engines for marine use. 
(a) General provisions.  If you are an engine manufacturer (including someone who marinizes a 
land-based engine), this section allows you to introduce new marine engines into U.S. commerce 
if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 
40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 89, 92, 1033, or 1039 for the appropriate model year.  If 
you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 
CFR part 86, 89, 92, 1033, or 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity 
under this part 1042 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the 
requirements of this part 1042.  This section does not apply for Category 3 engines. 
* * * * * 
 
95.  Section 1042.610 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: 
§1042.610  Certifying auxiliary marine engines to land-based standards. 
This section applies to auxiliary marine engines that are identical to certified land-based engines.  
See §1042.605 for provisions that apply to propulsion marine engines or auxiliary marine 
engines that are modified for marine applications.  This section does not apply for Category 3 
engines. 
* * * * * 
 
96.  Section 1042.615 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: 
§1042.615  Replacement engine exemption. 
For Category 1 and Category 2 replacement engines, apply the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.240 
as described in this section.  New Category 3 engines are not eligible for the replacement-engine 
exemption. 
* * * * * 
 
97.  Section 1042.620 is revised to read as follows: 
§1042.620  Engines used solely for competition. 
The provisions of this section apply for new engines and vessels built on or after January 1, 2009 
(a) We may grant you an exemption from the standards and requirements of this part for a new 
engine on the grounds that it is to be used solely for competition.  The requirements of this part, 
other than those in this section, do not apply to engines that we exempt for use solely for 
competition.  The prohibitions in §1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to engines exempted under this 
section. 
(b) We will exempt engines that we determine will be used solely for competition.  The basis of 
our determination is described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.  Exemptions granted 
under this section are good for only one model year and you must request renewal for each 
subsequent model year.  We will not approve your renewal request if we determine the engine 
 269
will not be used solely for competition.   
(c) Engines meeting all the following criteria are considered to be used solely for competition: 
(1) Neither the engine nor any vessels containing the engine may be displayed for sale in any 
public dealership or otherwise offered for sale to the general public.  Note that this does not 
preclude display of these engines as long as they are not available for sale to the general 
public. 
(2) Sale of the vessel in which the engine is installed must be limited to professional racing 
teams, professional racers, or other qualified racers.  Keep records documenting this, such as 
a letter requesting an exempted engine.For replacement engines, the sale of the engine itself 
must be limited to professional racing teams, professional racers, other qualified racers, or to 
the original vessel manufacturer.   
(3) The engine and the vessel in which it is installed must have performance characteristics 
that are substantially superior to noncompetitive models. 
(4) The engines are intended for use only as specified in paragraph (e) of this section. 
(d) You may ask us to approve an exemption for engines not meeting the applicable criteria 
listed in paragraph (c) of this section as long as you have clear and convincing evidence that the 
engines will be used solely for competition.   
(e) Engines will not beare considered to be used solely for competition if they are ever used for 
any recreational or other noncompetitive purpose.  This means that their use must beonly if  their 
use is limited to competition events sanctioned by the U.S. Coast Guard or another public 
organization with authorizing permits for participating competitors.  Operation forof such 
engines may include only racing events or, trials to qualify for racing events, and practice 
associated with racing events.  Authorized attempts to set speed records (and the associated 
official trials) are also considered racing events.  Any useEngines will not be considered to be 
used solely for competition if they are ever used for any recreational or other noncompetitive 
purpose.  Use of exempt engines in any recreational events, such as poker runs and lobsterboat 
races, is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(4).  
(f) You must permanently label engines exempted under this section to clearly indicate that they 
are to be used only for competition.  Failure to properly label an engine will void the exemption 
for that engine. 
(g) If we request it, you must provide us any information we need to determine whether the 
engines or vessels are used solely for competition.  This would include documentation regarding 
the number of engines and the ultimate purchaser of each engine as well as any documentation 
showing a vessel manufacturer’s request for an exempted engine.  Keep these records for five 
years. 
 
98.  Section 1042.625 is amended by adding introductory text to read as follows: 
§1042.625  Special provisions for engines used in emergency applications. 
This section describes an exemption that is available for certain Category 1 and Category 2 
engines.  This exemption is not available for Category 3 engines.

99.  Section 1042.630 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: 
§1042.630  Personal-use exemption. 
This section applies to individuals who manufacture vessels for personal use with used engines.  
If you and your vessel meet all the conditions of this section, the vessel and its engine are 
 270
considered to be exempt from the standards and requirements of this part that apply to new 
engines and new vessels.  The prohibitions in §1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to engines exempted 
under this section.  For example, you may install an engine that was not certified as a marine 
engine. 
* * * * * 
 
 
100.  Section 1042.635 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§1042.635  National security exemption. 
* * * * * 
(a) An engine is exempt without a request if it will be used or owned by an agency of the federal 
government responsible for national defense, where the vessel in which it is installed has armor, 
permanently attached weaponry, specialized electronic warfare systems, unique stealth 
performance requirements, and/or unique combat maneuverability requirements.  This applies to 
both remanufactured and freshly manufactured marine engines.  Gas turbine engines are also 
exempt without a request if they will be owned by an agency of the federal government 
responsible for national defense. 
* * * * * 
 
101.  Section 1042.650 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows: 
§1042.650  Migratory vessels. 
The provisions of this section address concerns for vessel owners related to extended use of 
vessels with Tier 4 engines outside the United States where ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel is not 
available.  The provisions of this section apply for Category 1 and Category 2 engines, including 
auxiliary engines installed on vessels with Category 3 propulsion engines.  These provisions do 
not apply for any Category 3 engines. 
* * * * * 
 
102.  A new §1042.655 is added to subpart G to read as follows: 
§1042.655  Special certification provisions for catalyst-equipped Category 3 engines. 
This section describes an optional approach for demonstrating for certification that catalyst-
equipped engines comply with applicable emission standards. 
(a) Eligibility.  You may use the provisions of this section without our prior approval to 
demonstrate that catalyst-equipped Category 3 engines meet the Tier 3 standards .  In unusual 
circumstances, we may also allow you to use this approach to demonstrate that catalyst-equipped 
Category 2 engines meet the Tier 4 standards.  We will generally approve this for Category 2 
engines only if the engines are too large to be practically tested in a laboratory with a fully 
assembled catalyst system.  If we approve this approach for a Category 2 engine, interpret 
references to Tier 3 in this section to mean Tier 4, and interpret references to Tier 2 in this 
section to mean Tier 3. 
(b) Required testing.  The emission-data engine must be tested as specified in Subpart F to verify 
that the engine-out emissions comply with the Tier 2 standards.  The catalyst material must be 
tested under conditions that accurately represent actual engine conditions for the test points.  
This catalyst testing may be performed on a benchscale. 
(c) Engineering analysis.  Include with your application a detailed engineering analysis 
describing how the test data collected for the engine and catalyst material demonstrate that all 
 271
engines in the family will meet all applicable emission standards.  We may require that you 
submit this analysis separately from your application, or that you obtain preliminary approval 
under §1042.210. 
(d) Verification.  You must verify your design by testing a complete production engine with 
installed catalysts in the final assembled configuration.  Unless we specify otherwise, do this by 
complying with production-line testing requirements of subpart D of this part. 
(e) Other requirements.  All other requirements of this part, including the non-testing 
requirements for certification, apply for these engines.  
 
103.  Section 1042.660 is revised to read as follows: 
§1042.660  Requirements for vessel manufacturers, owners, and operators. 
(a) The provisions of 40 CFR part 94, subpart K, apply to manufacturers, owners, and operators 
of marine vessels that contain Category 3 engines subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 94, 
subpart A. 
(b) For vessels equipped with emission controls requiring the use of specific fuels, lubricants, or 
other fluids, owners and operators must comply with the manufacturer/remanufacturer’s 
specifications for such fluids when operating the vessels.  Failure to comply with the 
requirements of this paragraph is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1).  For marine vessels 
containing Category 3 engines that are excluded from the requirements of 40 CFR part 1043 
because they operate only domestically, it is also a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) to 
operate the vessel using residual fuel.  Note that 40 CFR part 80 also includes provisions that 
restrict the use of certain fuels by certain marine engines. 
(cb) For vessels equipped with SCR systems requiring the use of urea or other reductants, owners 
and operators must report to us within 30 days any operation of such vessels without the 
appropriate reductant.  Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph is a violation of 
40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2). 
(c) The provisions of this paragraph (c) apply for marine vessels containing Category 3 engines.    
(1)All maintenance, repair, adjustment, and alteration of Category 3 engines subject to the 
provisions of this part performed by any owner, operator or other maintenance provider must 
be perform using good engineering judgment, in such a manner that the engine continues 
(after the maintenance, repair, adjustment or alteration) to meet the emission standards it was 
certified as meeting prior to the need for service.  This includes but is not limited to 
complying with the maintenance instructions described in §1042.125. Adjustments are 
limited to the range specified by the engine manufacturer in the approved application for 
certification.  
(2) It is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) to operate the vessel with the engine adjusted 
outside of the specified adjustable range.  Each two hour period of such operation constitutes 
a separate offense. A violation lasting less than two hours constitutes a single offense.  
(3) The owner and operator of the engine must maintain on board the vessel records of all 
maintenance, repair, and adjustment that could reasonably affect the emission performance of 
any engine subject to the provision of this part. Owners and operators must also maintain, on 
board the vessel, records regarding certification, parameter adjustment, and fuels used. For 
engines that are automatically adjusted electronically, all adjustments must be logged 
automatically. Owners and operators must make these records available to EPA upon request. 
These records must include the following: 
(i) The Technical File, Record Book of Engine Parameters, and bunker delivery notes 
 272
that are required by the Annex VI Technical Code (incorporated by reference in 
§1042.910).  This file must be transferred to subsequent purchasers in the event of a sale 
of the engine or vessel. 
(ii) Specific descriptions of engine maintenance, repair, adjustment, and alteration 
(including rebuilding). The descriptions must include at least the date, time, and nature of 
the maintenance, repair, adjustment, or alteration and the position of the vessel when the 
maintenance, repair, adjustment, or alteration was made. 
(iii) Emission-related maintenance instructions provided by the manufacturer.  These 
instructions must be transferred to subsequent purchasers in the event of a sale of the 
engine or vessel. 
(d) For each marine vessel containing a Category 3 engine, the owner must annually review the 
vessel's records and submit to EPA a signed statement certifying compliance during the 
preceding year with the requirements of this part that are applicable to owners and operators of 
such vessels. Alternately, if review of the vessel's records indicates that there has been one or 
more violations of the requirements of this part, the owner must submit to EPA a signed 
statement specifying the noncompliance, including the nature of the noncompliance, the time of 
the noncompliance, and any efforts made to remedy the noncompliance. The statement of 
compliance (or noncompliance) required by this paragraph must be signed by the executive with 
responsibility for marine activities of the owner. If the vessel is operated by a different business 
entity than the vessel owner, the reporting requirements of this paragraph (e) apply to both the 
owner and the operator. Compliance with these review and certification requirements by either 
the vessel owner or the vessel operator with respect to a compliance statement will be considered

§1043.1  Overview. 
The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) requires engine manufacturers, owners and operators of vessels, 
and other persons to comply with Annex VI of the MARPOL Protocol.  This part implements portions of APPS as it 
relates to Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of Annex VI.  These regulations clarify the application of some Annex VI 
provisions; provide procedures and criteria for the issuance of EIAPP certificates; and specify requirements 
applicable to ships that are not registered by Parties to Annex VI.  Additional regulations may also apply with 
respect to the MARPOL Protocol, such as those issued by the U.S. Coast Guard in 33 CFR part 151. 
(a) The general requirements for non-public U.S.-flagged and other Party vessels are specified in Annex VI, as 
implemented by 33 U.S.C. 1901-1915.  These requirements apply to engine manufacturers, owners and operators of 
vessels, and other persons.   
(b) The provisions of this part specify how Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of Annex VI, as implemented by 33 U.S.C. 
1901-1915 will be applied to public vessels and U.S.-flagged vessels that operate only domestically. This Part also 
describes where the requirements of Regulation 13.5.1 of Annex VI and Regulation 14.4 of Annex VI will apply. 
(c)  The provisions of this part implements section 1902(e) of APPS by specifying that non-public vessels flagged 
by a country that is not a party to Annex VI are subject to the substantive requirements of Regulations 13, 14 and 18 
of Annex VI as implemented by APPS. 
(d)  This part 1043 does not limit the requirements specified in Annex VI, as implemented by 33 U.S.C. 1901-1915, 
except as specified in §1043.10(a)(2).  Note that the reproduction of Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of Annex VI in 
Appendix I to this part 1043 does not affect any new provisions that may apply in the event that a future amendment 
 282
to Regulations 13, 14 or 18 of Annex VI enters into force for the United States. 
 
(e) The provisions of this part specify how to obtain EIAPP certificates and certificates for Approved Methods.

U.S.-flagged vessel means a vessel of U.S. registry or a vessel operated under the authority of the United 
States. 
We means EPA. 
 
§1043.30 General requirements. 
(a) Manufacturers, owners and operators of vessels subject to this part must comply with Regulations 13, 14, and 18 
of Annex VI and related provisions of this part.  It is the responsibility of such manufacturers, owners and operators 
to ensure that all employees and other agents operating on their behalf comply with these requirements.  
Manufacturers of engines subject to this part must comply with all applicable requirements of Regulation 13 of 
Annex VI and related provisions of this part prior to the engine being installed in the vessel.  Note that 33 U.S.C. 
1907 also prohibits anyone from violating any provisions of the MARPOL Protocol, whether or not they are a 
manufacturer, owner or operator. 
(b) Engines with power output of more than 130 kW that are listed in this paragraph (b) must be covered by a valid 
EIAPP certificate unless the engine is excluded under paragraph (c) of this section.  An EIAPP certificate is valid for 
a given engine only if it certifies compliance with the Tier of standards applicable to that engine and the vessel into 
which it is being installed.  Note that none of the requirements of this paragraph (b) are limited to new engines. 
(1) Engines meeting any of the following criteria must be covered by a valid EIAPP certificate: 
(i)  Engines installed (or intended to be installed) on vessels that were constructed on or after 
January 1, 2000.  This includes engines that met the definition of “new marine engine” in 40 CFR 
1042.901 at any time on or after January 1, 2000, unless such engines are installed on vessels that 
were constructed before January 1, 2000. 
(ii)  Engines that undergo a major conversion on or after January 1, 2000, unless the engine have 
been exempt from this requirement under paragraph (e) of this section.  See section 2.1 of 
Appendix I to this part for a definition of major conversion. 
(2) For such engines intended to be installed on U.S.-flagged vessels, the engine may not be introduced into 
U.S. commerce before it is covered by a valid EIAPP certificate, unless it has been exempted by EPA under 
40 CFR part 1042 or part 1068.  Uninstalled engines covered by a valid exemption under 40 CFR part 1042 
or part 1068 may be introduced into U.S. commerce without a valid EIAPP certificate; however, this 
allowance does affect whether the engine must ultimately be covered by an EIAPP certificate.  For 
example, engines allowed to be temporarily distributed in an uncertified configuration under 40 CFR 
1068.260 would not be required to be covered by an EIAPP certificate while it is covered by the temporary 
exemption under 40 CFR 1068.260; however, it would be required to be covered by an EIAPP certificate 
before being placed into service.  All uninstalled marine engines within the United States are presumed to 
be intended to be installed on a U.S.-flagged vessel, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the 
contrary.   
(3) For engines installed on Party vessels, the engine may not operate in the U.S. navigable waters or the 
U.S. exclusive economic zone, or other waters designated by the Administrator under 1902(a)(5) before it 
is covered by a valid EIAPP certificate.  Engines installed on non-Party vessels are not required to have 
EIAPP certificates, provided the operator can demonstrate that the engines conform to the requirements of 
Regulation 13 of Annex VI.  Evidence of conformity may be issued by either the government of a country 
that is party to Annex VI or a recognized classification society.  For the purposes of this paragraph, 
“recognized classification society” means a classification society that is a participating member of the 
International Association of Classification Societies (IACS). 
 (c)  The following engines are excluded from the requirement to have an EIAPP certificate (or equivalent 
demonstration of compliance in the case of non-Party vessels) or otherwise meet the requirements of Regulation 13 
of Annex VI. 
 284
(1) Spark-ignition engines. 
(2) Non-reciprocating engines. 
(3) Engines that do not use liquid fuel. 
(4) Engines intended to be used solely for emergencies.  This includes engines that power equipment such 
as pumps that are intended to be used solely for emergencies and engines installed in lifeboats intended to 
be used solely for emergencies.  It does not include engines to be used for both emergency and non-
emergency purposes. 
(d) The requirements specified in Annex VI (reproduced in Appendix I to this part) apply for vessels subject to this 
part for operation in U.S. navigable waters or the U.S. EEZ.  Vessels operating in waters deemed to be included in 
an ECA under this part (see §1043.20) must comply with the requirements of Annex VI for operation in an ECA.  
This means that the requirements of Regulations 13.5 and 14.4 of Annex VI apply both in waters designated by IMO 
as an ECA and in all shoreward U.S. waters.  
(e) A replacement engine may be exempted from Regulation 13 of annex VI by EPA if it is identical to the engine 
being replaced and that engine was not subject to Regulation 13 of Annex VI.  Send requests for such exemptions to 
the Designated Certification Officer. 
(f) Compliance with the provisions of this part 1043 does not affect your responsibilities under 40 CFR part 1042 for 
engines subject to that part 1042. 
 
§1043.40 EIAPP certificates 
(a) Engine manufacturers seeking EIAPP certificates for new engines to be used in U.S.-flagged vessels must apply 
to EPA for an EIAPP certificate in compliance with the requirements of this section (which references 40 CFR part 
1042) and the applicable requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI.    Note that only the Administrator or the EPA 
official designated by the Administrator may issue EIAPP certificates on behalf of the United States Government. 
(b) Persons other than engine manufacturers may apply for and obtain EIAPP certificates for new engines to be used 
in U.S.-flagged vessels by complying with the requirements of this section (which references 40 CFR part 1042) and 
the applicable requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI.  
(c) In appropriate circumstances, EPA may issue an EIAPP certificate under this section for non-new engines or 
engines for vessels that will not initially be flagged in the U.S. 
(d) The process for obtaining an EIAPP certificate is described in §1043.41.  That section references regulations in 
40 CFR part 1042, which apply under the Clean Air Act.  References in that part to certificates of conformity are 
deemed to mean EIAPP certificates.  References in that part to the Clean Air Act as the applicable statute are 
deemed to mean 33 U.S.C. 1901-1915. 
(e) For engines that undergo a major conversion or for engines installed on imported vessels that become subject to 
the requirements of this part, we may specify alternate certification provisions consistent with the intent of this part. 
 
§1043.41 EIAPP certification process 
This section describes the process for obtaining the EIAPP certificate required by §1043.40. 
(a) You must send the Designated Certification Officer (see definition in §1043.20) a separate application for an 
Engine International Air Pollution Prevention (EIAPP) certificate for each engine family.  An EIAPP certificate is 
valid starting with the indicated effective date and is valid for any production until such time as the design of the 
engine family changes or more stringent emission standards become applicable, whichever comes first.  You may 
obtain preliminary approval of portions of the application consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1042.210. 
(b) The application must contain all the information required by this part.  It must not include false or incomplete 
statements or information (see 40 CFR 1042.255).  Include the information specified in 40 CFR 1042.205 except as 
follows: 
(i) You must include the dates on which the test engines were built and the locations where the test engines 
were built. 
(ii) Include a copy of documentation required by Annex VI related to maintenance and in-use compliance 
(such as the Technical File and onboard NOx verification procedures as specified by the NOx Technical 
Code). 
(iii) You are not required to provide information required by 40 CFR 1042.205 about useful life, emission 
labels, deterioration factors, PM emissions, not-to-exceed standards. 
(iv)You must include a copy of your warranty instructions, but are not required to describe how you will 
meet warranty obligations.  
(c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in this section as long as you maintain all the 
information required by paragraph (b) of this section. 
 285
(d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related to your application (see 40 CFR 1068.5). 
(e) An authorized representative of your company must approve and sign the application. 
(f) See 40 CFR 1042.255 for provisions describing how we will process your application.  
(g) Your application, including the Technical File and onboard NOx verification procedures, is subject to 
amendment as described in 40 CFR 1042.225.  
(h) This paragraph (h) describes the emission testing you must perform. 
(1) Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing.  For engines at or above 560 kW, you may 
use a development engine that is equivalent in design to the engine being certified.  For Category 3 engines, you 
may use a single-cylinder version of the engine.  Using good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration 
most likely to exceed an applicable emission standard, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the range of 
installation options available to vessel manufacturers. 
(2) Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in the NOx Technical Code or 
subpart F of part 1042.  We may require that your test be witnessed by an EPA official. 
(3) We may measure emissions from any of your test engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows: 
(i) We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility.  You must deliver the test engine to any test 
facility we designate.  The test engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, 
electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block.  
If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, 
personnel, and equipment we need.  
(ii) If we measure emissions from one of your test engines, the results of that testing become the official emission 
results for the engine.  Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining 
if your engine family meets applicable requirements. 
(iii) Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the specified 
adjustable ranges (see 40 CFR 1042.115(d)). 
(iv) Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do 
not consider an adjustable parameter. 
(4) We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested 
under paragraph (b) of this section. 
(5) If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not 
produce results that are equivalent to the procedures otherwise required by this part, we may reject data you 
generated using the alternate procedure. 
(i) Collect emission data using measurements to one more decimal place than the applicable standard.  Then round 
the value to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.  Compare the rounded emission levels to 
the emission standard for each emission-data engine.    
(j) Your engine family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in Regulation 13 of Annex VI if all 
emission-data engines representing that family have test results showing emission levels at or below these standards.  
Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results 
showing an emission level above an applicable emission standard for any pollutant.  
(k) If we determine your application is complete and shows that the engines meet all the requirements of this part, 
we will issue an EIAPP certificate for your engines.  We may make the approval subject to additional conditions. 
 
§1043.50 Approval of methods to meet Tier 1 retrofit NOx standards. 
Regulation 13 of Annex VI provides for certification of Approved Methods, which are retrofit procedures that 
enable Pre-Tier 1 engines to meet the Tier 1 NOx standard of regulation 13 of Annex VI.  Any person may request 
approval of such a method by submitting an application for certification of an Approve Method to the Designated 
Certification Officer.  If we determine that your application conforms to the requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex 
VI, we will issue a certificate and notify IMO that your Approved Method has been certified. 
 
§1043.60 Operating requirements for engines and vessels subject to this part. 
(a) All of the operating requirements and restrictions of Regulations 13, 14, and 18 of Annex VI apply for vessels 
subject to this part. 
(b) Nothing in this part limits the operating requirements and restrictions applicable for engines and vessels subject 
to 40 CFR part 1042 or the requirements and restrictions applicable for fuels subject to 40 CFR part 80. 
(c) Operators of non-Party vessels must comply with the same operating requirements and restrictions as apply to 
other vessels under this part.  This means they must comply with operating requirements and restrictions equivalent 
to those of Annex VI related to Regulations 13, 14, and 18. 
 286
(d) This paragraph (d) applies for vessels that are excluded from Regulation 13 of Annex VI under §1043.10(a) 
because they operate only domestically.  Where the operators of such vessels comply fully with the fuel 
requirements of 40 CFR part 80, they are deemed to be in full compliance with the fuel use requirements and 
prohibitions of Regulations 14 and 18 of Annex VI. 
 
§1043.70  General recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 
(a) Owners and operators of vessels subject to this part must keep all records required by Regulations 13, 14, and 18 
of Annex VI.  We may inspect these records as allowed by those Regulations and 33 U.S.C. 1901-1915.  As part of 
our inspection, we may require that the owner submit copies of these records to us. 
(b) Nothing in this part limits recordkeeping and reporting the Secretary may require, nor does it preclude the 
Secretary from providing copies of any records to EPA. 
(c) Nothing in this part limits the recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable with respect to engines and 
vessels subject to 40 CFR part 1042 or with respect to fuels subject to 40 CFR part 80. 
(d) This paragraph (d) applies for vessels that are excluded from Regulation 13 of Annex VI under §1043.10(a) 
because they operate only domestically.  Where the operators of such vessels comply fully with the fuel 
requirements of 40 CFR part 80, they are deemed to be in full compliance with the fuel recordkeeping requirements 
and prohibitions of Annex VI. 
 
§1043.80  Recordkeeping and reporting requirements for fuel suppliers. 
If you supply any fuel for an engine on any vessel identified in paragraph (a) of this section, you must comply with 
the requirements of Regulation 18 of Annex VI to provide bunker delivery notes to the vessel operators and to keep 
copies for your records. 
(a) The requirements of this section apply for fuel delivered to any of the following vessels: 
(1) Vessels of 400 gross tonnage and above. 
(2) Platforms and drilling rigs. 
(b) Except as allowed by paragraph (d) of this section, the bunker delivery note must contain the following: 
(1) The name and IMO number of receiving vessel. 
(2) Port (or other description of the location, if the delivery does not take place at a port). 
(3) Date the fuel is delivered to the vessel (or date on which the delivery begins where the delivery begins 
on one day and ends on a later day). 
(4) Name, address, and telephone number of fuel supplier. 
(5) Fuel type and designation under 40 CFR part 80. 
(6) Quantity in metric tons. 
(7) Density at 15°C, in kg/m3. 
(8) Sulfur content in weight percent. 
(9) A signed statement by an authorized representative of fuel supplier certifying that the fuel supplied 
conforms to Regulations 14 and 18 of Annex VI consistent with it designation, intended use, and the date 
on which it is to be used.  For example, with respect to conformity to Regulation 14 of Annex VI, a fuel 
designated and intended for use in an ECA any time between July 1, 2010 and January 1 2015 may not 
have a sulfur content above 1.00 weight percent. 
(c) Measure density and sulfur content according to the specifications of Annex VI, or other methods we approve as 
equivalent.  Where the density and/or sulfur content of the delivered fuel cannot be measured, we may allow the use 
of alternate methods to specify the density and/or sulfur content of the fuel.  For example, where fuel is supplied 
from multiple tanks on a supply vessel, we may allow the density and sulfur content of the fuel to be calculated as a 
weighted average of the measured densities and sulfur contents of the fuel that is supplied from each tank.

this regulation and an appropriate notation of the engine certification on the ship‘s International Air Pollution 
Prevention Certificate.  
7.2 Subparagraph 7.1 shall apply no later than the first renewal survey that occurs 12 months or more after deposit 
of the notification in subparagraph 7.1.  If a shipowner of a ship on which an Approved Method is to be installed can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administration that the Approved Method was not commercially available 
despite best efforts to obtain it, then that Approved Method shall be installed on the ship no later than the next 
annual survey of that ship which falls after the Approved Method is commercially available.  
7.3 With regard to a ship with a marine diesel engine with a power output of more than 5,000 kW and a per cylinder 
displacement at or above 90 litres installed on a ship constructed on or after 1 January 1990 but prior to 1 January 
2000, the International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate shall, for a marine diesel engine to which paragraph 7.1 
of this regulation applies, indicate that either an Approved Method has been applied pursuant to paragraph 7.1.1 of 
this regulation or the engine has been certified pursuant to paragraph 7.1.2 of this regulation or that an Approved 
Method does not yet exist or is not yet commercially available as described in subparagraph 7.2 of this regulation.  
 289
7.4 Subject to regulation 3 of this Annex, the operation of a marine diesel engine described in subparagraph 7.1 is 
prohibited, except when the emission of nitrogen oxides (calculated as the total weighted emission of NO2) from the 
engine is within the following limits, where n = rated engine speed (crankshaft revolutions per minute):  
7.4.1  17.0 g/kWh when n is less than 130 rpm;  
7.4.2  45 n(-0.2) g/kWh when n is 130 or more but less than 2000 rpm; and  
7.4.3  9.8 g/kWh when n is 2,000 rpm or more.  
7.5 Certification of an Approved Method shall be in accordance with chapter 7 of the revised NOx Technical Code 
2008 and shall include verification:  
7.5.1 by the designer of the base marine diesel engine to which the Approved Method applies that the calculated 
effect of the Approved Method will not decrease engine rating by more than 1.0%, increase fuel consumption by 
more than 2.0% as measured according to the appropriate test cycle set forth in the revised NOx Technical Code 
2008, or adversely affect engine durability or reliability, and 
7.5.2 that the cost of the Approved Method is not excessive, which is determined by a comparison of the amount of 
NOx reduced by the Approved Method to achieve the standard set forth in subparagraph 7.4 of this paragraph and 
the cost of purchasing and installing such Approved Method.  
 
Certification  
8 The revised NOx Technical Code 2008 shall be applied in the certification, testing, and measurement procedures 
for the standards set forth in this regulation.  
9 The procedures for determining NOx emissions set out in the revised NOx Technical Code 2008 are intended to be 
representative of the normal operation of the engine.  Defeat devices and irrational emission control strategies 
undermine this intention and shall not be allowed. This regulation shall not prevent the use of auxiliary control 
devices that are used to protect the engine and/or its ancillary equipment against operating conditions that could 
result in damage or failure or that are used to facilitate the starting of the engine.  
 
Review  
10 Beginning in 2012 and completed no later than 2013, the Organization shall review the status of the technological 
developments to implement the standards set forth in paragraph 5.1.1 of this regulation and shall, if proven 
necessary, adjust the time periods set forth in that subparagraph.

insofar as they relate to paragraph 4 of this regulation.  
 
Review Provision  
8 A review of the standard set forth in subparagraph 1.3 of this regulation shall be completed by 2018 to determine 
the availability of fuel oil to comply with the fuel oil standard set forth in that paragraph and shall take into account 
the following elements:  
8.1  the global market supply and demand for fuel oil to comply with  paragraph 1.3 of this regulation that exist 
at the time that the review is conducted;  
8.2  an analysis of the trends in fuel oil markets; and  
8.3  any other relevant issue.  
9 The Organization shall establish a group of experts, comprising of representatives with the appropriate expertise in 
the fuel oil market and appropriate maritime, environmental, scientific, and legal expertise, to conduct the review 
referred to in paragraph 8 of this regulation. The group of experts shall develop the appropriate information to 
inform the decision to be taken by the Parties.  
 
 
10 The Parties, based on the information developed by the group of experts, may decide whether it is possible for 
ships to comply with the date in paragraph 1.3 of this regulation.  If a decision is taken that it is not possible for 
ships to comply, then the standard in that subparagraph shall become effective on 1 January 2025.  
  
 291
Regulation 18 Fuel Oil Availability and Quality  
 
Fuel Oil Availability  
1 Each Party shall take all reasonable steps to promote the availability of fuel oils which comply with this Annex 
and inform the Organization of the availability of compliant fuel oils in its ports and terminals.   
2.1 If a ship is found by a Party not to be in compliance with the standards for compliant fuel oils set forth in this 
Annex, the competent authority of the Party is entitled to require the ship to:  
2.1.1  present a record of the actions taken to attempt to achieve compliance; and  
2.1.2  provide evidence that it attempted to purchase compliant fuel oil in accordance with its voyage plan and, if 
it was not made available where planned, that attempts were made to locate alternative sources for such fuel oil and 
that despite best efforts to obtain compliant fuel oil, no such fuel oil was made available for purchase.  
2.2 The ship should not be required to deviate from its intended voyage or to delay unduly the voyage in order to 
achieve compliance.  
2.3 If a ship provides the information set forth in subparagraph 2.1 of this paragraph, a Party shall take into account 
all relevant circumstances and the evidence presented to determine the appropriate action to take, including not 
taking control measures.  
2.4 A ship shall notify its Administration and the competent authority of the relevant port of destination when it 
cannot purchase compliant fuel oil.  
2.5 A Party shall notify the Organization when a ship has presented evidence of the non-availability of compliant 
fuel oil.  
 
Fuel Oil Quality  
3 Fuel oil for combustion purposes delivered to and used onboard ships to which this Annex applies shall meet the 
following requirements:  
3.1 except as provided in subparagraph 3.2:  
3.1.1  the fuel oil shall be blends of hydrocarbons derived from petroleum refining. This shall not preclude the 
incorporation of small amounts of additives intended to improve some aspects of performance;  
3.1.2 the fuel oil shall be free from inorganic acid; and  
3.1.3 the fuel oil shall not include any added substance or chemical waste which: .1.3.1 jeopardizes the safety of 
ships or adversely affects the performance  
of the machinery, or  
3.1.3.2 is harmful to personnel, or  
3.1.3.3 contributes overall to additional air pollution.  
3.2 fuel oil for combustion purposes derived by methods other than petroleum refining shall not: 3.2.1 exceed the 
applicable sulphur content set forth in regulation 14 of this Annex;  
3.2.2 cause an engine to exceed the applicable NOx emission limit set forth in paragraphs 3, 4, 5.1.1 and 7.4 of 
regulation 13;  
3.2.3 contain inorganic acid; or  
3.2.4.1 jeopardize the safety of ships or adversely affect the performance of the machinery, or 
3.2.4.2 be harmful to personnel, or  
3.2.4.3 contribute overall to additional air pollution.  
4 This regulation does not apply to coal in its solid form or nuclear fuels.  
5 For each ship subject to regulations 5 and 6 of this Annex, details of fuel oil for combustion purposes delivered to 
and used onboard shall be recorded by means of a bunker delivery note which shall contain at least the information 
specified in appendix V to this Annex.  
6 The bunker delivery note shall be kept onboard the ship in such a place as to be readily available for inspection at 
all reasonable times.  It shall be retained for a period of three years after the fuel oil has been delivered on board.  
7.1 The competent authority of a Party may inspect the bunker delivery notes onboard any ship to which this Annex 
applies while the ship is in its port or offshore terminal, may make a copy of each delivery note, and may require the 
master or person in charge of the ship to certify that each copy is a true copy of such bunker delivery note.  The 
competent authority may also verify the contents of each note through consultations with the port where the note 
was issued.  
7.2 The inspection of the bunker delivery notes and the taking of certified copies by the competent authority under 
this paragraph shall be performed as expeditiously as possible without causing the ship to be unduly delayed.  
8.1 The bunker delivery note shall be accompanied by a representative sample of the fuel oil delivered taking into 
account guidelines developed by the Organization.10 The sample is to be sealed and signed by the supplier‘s 
 292
representative and the master or officer in charge of the bunker operation on completion of bunkering operations and 
retained under the ship‘s control until the fuel oil is substantially consumed, but in any case for a period of not less 
than 12 months from the time of delivery.  
8.2 If an Administration requires the representative sample to be analysed, it shall be done in accordance with the 
verification procedure set forth in appendix VI to determine whether the fuel oil meets the requirements of this 
Annex.  
9 Parties undertake to ensure that appropriate authorities designated by them:  
9.1 maintain a register of local suppliers of fuel oil;  
9.2 require local suppliers to provide the bunker delivery note and sample as required by this regulation, certified by 
the fuel oil supplier that the fuel oil meets the requirements of regulations 14 and 18 of this Annex;  
9.3 require local suppliers to retain a copy of the bunker delivery note for at least three years for inspection and 
verification by the port State as necessary;  
9.4 take action as appropriate against fuel oil suppliers that have been found to deliver fuel oil that does not comply 
with that stated on the bunker delivery note;  
9.5 inform the Administration of any ship receiving fuel oil found to be non-compliant with the requirements of 
regulation 14 or 18 of this Annex; and  
9.6 inform the Organization for transmission to Parties and Member States of the Organization of all cases where 
fuel oil suppliers have failed to meet the requirements specified in regulations 14 or 18 of this Annex.  
10 In connection with port State inspections carried out by Parties, the Parties further undertake to:  
10.1 inform the Party or non-Party under whose jurisdiction a bunker delivery note was issued of cases of delivery 
of noncompliant fuel oil, giving all relevant information; and  
10.2 ensure that remedial action as appropriate is taken to bring noncompliant fuel oil discovered into compliance.  
11 For every ship of 400 gross tonnage and above on scheduled services with frequent and regular port calls, an 
Administration may decide after application and consultation with affected States that compliance with paragraph 6 
of this regulation may be documented in an alternative manner which gives similar certainty of compliance with 
regulations 14 and 18 of this Annex.

Part 1045— Control of Emissions from Spark-ignition Propulsion Marine Engines and 
Vessels 
 
119.  The authority citation for part 1045 continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. 
 
Subpart B—[Amended] 
 
120.  Section 1045.103 is amended by revising paragraph (b) introductory text to read 
as follows: 
§1045.103 What exhaust emission standards must my outboard and personal watercraft 
engines meet? 
* * * * * 
(b) Averaging, banking, and trading.  You may generate or use emission credits under the 
averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program described in subpart H of this part for 
demonstrating compliance with HC+NOx emission standards.  For CO emissions, you may 
generate or use emission credits for averaging as described in subpart H of this part, but such 
credits may not for bankingbe banked or tradingtraded.  To generate or use emission credits, you 
must specify a family emission limit for each pollutant you include in the ABT program for each 
engine family.  These family emission limits serve as the emission standards for the engine 
family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards specified in this section.  An 
engine family meets emission standards even if its family emission limit is higher than the 
standard, as long as you show that the whole averaging set of applicable engine families meets 
the emission standards using emission credits and the engines within the family meet the family 
emission limit.  The following FEL caps apply: 
* * * * * 
 
121.  Section 1045.140 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§1045.140  What is my engine’s maximum engine power? 
(a) An engine configuration’s maximum engine power is the maximum brake power point on the 
nominal power curve for the engine configuration, as defined in this section.  Round the power 
value to the nearest whole kilowatt for engines above 30 kW and to the nearest 0.1 kilowatt for 
engines at or below 30 kW. 
* * * * * 
 
122.  Section 1045.145 is amended by adding paragraph (o) to read as follows: 
§1045.145  Are there interim provisions that apply only for a limited time? 
* * * * * 
(o) Banking early credits for jet boat engines. Banked emission credits that were originally 
generated from outboard and personal watercraft engines under 40 CFR part 91 may be used to 
certify jet boat engines under the provisions §1045.660. 
 
Subpart F—[Amended] 
 
123.  Section 1045.515 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(5) introductory text to 
 294
read as follows: 
§1045.515  What are the test procedures related to not-to-exceed standards? 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
(5) For two-stroke engines not equipped with a catalyst, the NTE zone described in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section is divided into subzones for testing to determine compliance 
with the applicable NTE standards.  Measure emissions to get an NTE result by collecting 
emissions at five points as described in this paragraph (c)(5).  Calculate a weighted test result 
for these emission measurements using the weighting factors from Appendix III of this part 
for the corresponding modal result (similar to discrete-mode testing for certification).  Test 
engines over the following modes corresponding to the certification duty cycle: 
* * * * * 
 
Subpart H—[Amended] 
 
124.  Section 1045.701 is amended by revising paragraphs (d), (g), (j)(4) and (j)(5) to 
read as follows: 
§1045.701  General provisions. 
* * * * * 
(d) Sterndrive/inboard engines certified under §1045.660 for jet boats may use HC+NOx and CO 
exhaust credits generated from outboard and personal watercraft engines, as long as the credit-
using engine is the same model as an engine model from an outboard or personal watercraft 
family.  TheseSuch emission credits that you generate under this part 1045 may be used for 
averaging, but not for banking or trading.  The FEL caps for such jet boat families are the 
HC+NOx and CO standard for outboard and personal watercraft engines.  U.S.-directed sales 
from jet boat engines using the provisions of this paragraph (d) may not be greater than the U.S.-
directed sales of the same engine model for outboard or personal watercraft engines. 
* * * * * 
(g) Emission credits may be used for averaging in the model year they are generated (or banked 
for averaging) and in future model years (banking), except that CO emission credits for outboard 
and personal watercraft engines may not be banked or traded.  
* * * * * 
(j) * * * 
(4) Engines or vessels not subject to the requirements of this part, such as those excluded 
under §1054.5§1045.5. 
(5) Any other engines or vessels where we indicate elsewhere in this part 10541045 that they 
are not to be included in the calculations of this subpart. 
 
125.  Section 1045.705 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§1045.705  How do I generate and calculate exhaust emission credits? 
* * * * * 
(a) For each participating family, calculate positive or negative emission credits relative to the 
otherwise applicable emission standard.  Calculate positive emission credits for a family that has 
an FEL below the standard.  Calculate negative emission credits for a family that has an FEL 
above the standard.  Sum your positive and negative credits for the model year before rounding.  
Round the sum of emission credits to the nearest kilogram (kg) using consistent units throughout 
 295
the following equation: 
 
 Emission credits (kg) = (STD - FEL) Η (Volume) Η (Power) Η (UL) Η (LF) Η(10-3) 
 
Where:  
STD = the emission standard, in g/kW-hr. 
FEL = the family emission limit for the family, in g/kW-hr. 
Volume = the number of engines eligible to participate in the averaging, banking, and trading 
program within the given family during the model year, as described in §1045.701(j). 
Power = maximum engine power for the family, in kilowatts (see §1045.140). 
UL = The useful life for the given family. 
LF = load factor.  Use 0.207.  We may specify a different load factor if we approve the use of 
special test procedures for an engine family under 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(2), consistent with 
good engineering judgment. 
* * * * * 
 
Subpart I—[Amended] 
 
126.  Section 1045.801 is amended by revising paragraphs (2) and (5)(iii) of the 
definition of “Model year” to read as follows: 
§1045.801  What definitions apply to this part? 
 Model year * * * 
(2) For an engine that is converted to a propulsion marine engine after being certified and placed 
into service as a motor vehicle engine, a nonroad engine that is not a propulsion marine engine, 
or a stationary engine, model year means the model calendar year in which the engine was 
originally produced.  For an engine that is converted to a nonroad propulsion marine engine after 
being placed into service as a motor vehicle engine, a nonroad engine that is not a propulsion 
marine engine, or a stationary engine without having been certified, model year means the 
calendar year in which the engine becomes a new nonroad propulsion marine engine.  (See 
definition of “new propulsion marine engine,” paragraph (2).) 
* * * * * 
(5) * * * 
(iii) For imported engines described in paragraph (5)(iii) of the definition of “new nonroad 
propulsion marine nonroad engine,” model year means the calendar year in which the engine 
is assembled in its imported configuration, unless specified otherwise in this part or in 40 
CFR part 1068.

Subpart B—[Amended] 
 
128.  Section 1048.120 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 
§1048.120  What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me? 
* * * * * 
(b) Warranty period.  Your emission-related warranty for evaporative emission controls must be 
valid for at least two years.  Your emission-related warranty for exhaust emission controls must 
be valid for at least 50 percent of the engine’s useful life in hours of operation or at least three 
years, whichever comes first.  In the case of a high-cost warranted part, the warranty must be 
valid for at least 70 percent of the engine’s useful life in hours of operation or at least five years, 
whichever comes first.  You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we 
require.  The emission-related warranty for the engine may not be shorter than any published 
warranty you offer without charge for the engine.  Similarly, the emission-related warranty for 
any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that 
component.  If an engine has no hour meter, we base the warranty periods in this paragraph (b) 
only on the engine’s age (in years).  The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into 
service.

Subpart C—[Amended] 
 
129.  Section 1048.245 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
§1048.245  How do I demonstrate that my engine family complies with evaporative 
emission standards? 
* * * * * 
(e) You may demonstrate that your engine family complies with the evaporative emission 
standards by demonstrating that you use the following control technologies: 
(1) For certification to the standards specified in §1048.105(a)(1) (c), with the following 
technologies: 
(i)  Use a tethered or self-closing gas cap on a fuel tank that stays sealed up to a positive 
pressure of 24.5 kPa (3.5 psig); however, they may contain air inlets that open when there 
is a vacuum pressure inside the tank.  Nonmetal fuel tanks must also use one of the 
qualifying designs for controlling permeation emissions specified in 40 CFR 1060.240. 
(ii) [Reserved] 
(2) For certification to the standards specified in §1048.105(a)(3) (d), demonstrating that you 
use design features to prevent fuel boiling under all normal operation.  If you install engines 
in equipment, you may do this using fuel temperature data measured during normal 
operation.  Otherwise, you may do this by including appropriate information in your 
emission-related installation instructions. 
(3)  We may establish additional options for design-based certification where we find that 
 297
new test data demonstrate that a technology will ensure compliance with the emission 
standards in this section 
 
Subpart F—[Amended] 
 
130.  Section 1048.505 is amended by revising the section heading and paragraph

Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. 
 
Subpart A—[Amended] 
 
132.  Section 1051.20 is amended by adding paragraph (g) to read as follows: 
§1051.20  May I certify a recreational engine instead of the vehicle? 
* * * * * 
(g) Apply the provisions of 40 CFR part 1068 for engines certified under this section as if they 
were subject to engine-based standards.  For example, you may rely on the provisions of 40 CFR 
1068.261 to have vehicle manufacturers install catalysts that you describe in your application for 
certification. 
 
 
Subpart B—[Amended]

Subpart I—[Amended] 
 
134.  Section 1051.801 is amended by revising the definition for “Off-road utility 
vehicle” and revising paragraph (2) of the definition for “All-terrain vehicle” to read as 
follows: 
§1051.801  What definitions apply to this part? 
* * * * * 
 All-terrain vehicle* * * 
(2)  Other all-terrain vehicles have three or more wheels and one or more seats, are designed for 
operation over rough terrain, are intended primarily for transportation, and have a maximum 
vehicle speed ofhigher than 25 miles per hour or higher.  Golf carts generally do not meet these 
criteria since they are generally not designed  for operation over rough terrain.   
* * * * * 
 Offroad utility vehicle means a nonroad vehicle that has four or more wheels, seating for 
two or more persons, is designed for operation over rough terrain, and has either a rear payload 
capacity of 350 pounds or more or seating for six or more passengers. Vehicles intended 
primarily for recreational purposes that are not capable of transporting six passengers (such as 
dune buggies) are not offroad utility vehicles. (Note:§1051.1(a) specifies that some offroad 
 299
utility vehicles are required to meet the requirements that apply for all-terrain vehicles.)  Unless 
there is significant information to the contrary, we consider vehicles to be intended primarily for 
recreational purposes if they are marketed for recreational use, have a rear payload capacity no 
greater than 1,000 pounds, and meet at least five of the following criteria: 
(1) Front and rear suspension travel is greater than 18 cm. 
(2) The vehicle has no tilt bed. 
(3) The vehicle has no mechanical power take-off (PTO) and no permanently installed hydraulic 
system for operating utility-oriented accessory devices. 
(4) The engine has in-use operating speeds at or above 4,000 rpm. 
(5) Maximum vehicle speed is greater than 35 miles per hour. 
(6) The speed at which the engine produces peak power is above 4,5000 rpm and the engine is 
equivalent to engines in ATVs that you have certified.  For the purpose of this paragraph (6), the 
engine is considered equivalent if it could be included in the same emission family based on the 
characteristics specified in §1051.230(b). 
(7) Gross Vehicle Weight Rating is no greater than 3,750 pounds.  This is the maximum design 
loaded weight of the vehicle as defined in 40 CFR 86.1803-01, including passengers and cargo.

135.  The authority citation for part 1054 continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. 
 
 
Subpart A—[Amended] 
 
136.  Section 1054.1 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(4) to read as follows: 
§1054.1  Does this part apply for my engines and equipment? 
(a) * * * 
(4) This part 1054 applies for other spark-ignition engines as follows: 
 (i) The provisions of §§1054.620 and 1054.801 apply for new engines used solely 
for competition beginning January 1, 2010. 
 (ii) The provisions of §§1054.660 and 1054.801 apply for new engines used in 
emergency rescue equipment beginning January 1, 2010. 
* * * * * 
 
Subpart C—[Amended] 
 
137.  Section 1054.205 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 
§1054.205  What must I include in my application? 
* * * * * 
(b) Explain how the emission control systems operate.  Describe the evaporative emission 
controls and show how your design will prevent running loss emissions, if applicable.  Also 
describe in detail all system components for controlling exhaust emissions, including all 
auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) and all fuel-system components you will install on 
any production or test engine.  Identify the part number of each component you describe (or the 
alphanumeric designation for catalysts described in §1054.610, if applicable).  For this paragraph 
(b), treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or activate differently from each other.  
Include sufficient detail to allow us to evaluate whether the AECDs are consistent with the defeat 
device prohibition of §1054.115.  For example, if your engines will routinely experience in-use 
operation that differs from the specified duty cycle for certification, describe how the fuel-
metering system responds to varying speeds and loads not represented by the duty cycle.  If you 
test an emission-data engine by disabling the governor for full-load operation such that the 
engine operates at an air-fuel ratio significantly different than under full-load operation with an 
installed governor, explain why these differences are necessary or appropriate.  For conventional 
carbureted engines without electronic fuel controls, it is sufficient to state that there is no 
significant difference in air-fuel ratios.  
* * * * * 
 
Subpart G—[Amended] 
 
138.  Section 1054.601 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows: 
§1054.601  What compliance provisions apply to these engines? 
 301
* * * * * 
(c) The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.215 apply for cases in which the manufacturer takes 
possession of engines for purposes of recovering components as described in this paragraph (c).  
Note that this paragraph (c) does not apply for certified engines that still have the emission 
control information label since such engines do not need an exemption.  
(1) You must label the engine as specified in 40 CFR 1068.215(c)(3), except that the label 
may be removable as specified in 40 CFR 1068.45(b).  
(2) You may not resell the engine.  For components other than the engine block, you may 
generate revenue from the sale of the components that you recover, or from the sale of new 
engines containing these components.  You may also use components other than the engine 
block for engine rebuilds as otherwise allowed under the regulations.  You may use the 
engine block from an engine that is exempted under this paragraph (c) only to make a new 
engine, and then only where such an engine has a separate identity from the original engine. 
(3) Once the engine has reached its final destination, you may stop collecting records 
describing the engine’s final disposition and how you use the engine. This does not affect the 
requirement to maintain the records you have already collected under 40 CFR 1068.215.  
This also does not affect the requirement to maintain records for new engines. 
 
139.  Section 1054.690 is amended by revising paragraphs (d) and (j) to read as 
follows: 
§1054.690  What bond requirements apply for certified engines? 
* * * * * 
(d) The minimum value of the bond is $500,000.  A higher bond value may apply based on the 
per-engine bond values shown in Table 1 to this section and on the U.S.-directed production 
volume from each displacement grouping for the calendar calendarmodel year.  For example, if 
you have projected U.S.-directed production volumes of 10,000 engines with 180 cc 
displacement and 10,000 engines with 400 cc displacement in 2013, the appropriate bond 
amount is $750,000.  Adjust the value of the bond as follows: 
(1) If your estimated or actual U.S.-directed production volume in any later calendar year 
increases beyond the level appropriate for your current bond payment, you must post 
additional bond to reflect the increased volume within 90 days after you change your 
estimate or determine the actual production volume.  You may not decrease your bond.   
(2) If you sell engines without aftertreatment components under the provisions of §1054.610, 
you must increase the per-engine bond values for the current year by 20 percent.  Round 
calculated values to the nearest dollar. 
 
Table 1 to §1054.690—Per-engine bond values 
For engines with displacement  
falling in the following ranges... 
The per-engine bond value 
is... 
 Disp.  <  225 cc $25 
225 <  Disp. < 740 cc $50 
740  <  Disp. < 1,000 cc $100 
Disp.  > 1,000 cc $200 
* * * * * 
 302
(j) The following provisions apply if you import engines for resale when those engines have been 
certified by someone else (or equipment containing such engines): 
(1) You and the certificate holder are each responsible for compliance with the requirements 
of this part and the Clean Air Act.  For example, we may require you to comply with the 
warranty requirements in the standard-setting part§1054.120. 
(2) You do not need to post bond if you or the certificate holder complies with the bond 
requirements of this section.  You also do not need to post bond if the certificate holder 
complies with the asset requirements of this section and the repair-network provisions of 
§1054.120(f)(4). 
 
Subpart H—[Amended] 
 
140.  Section 1054.730 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(4) to read as follows: 
§1054.730  What ABT reports must I send to EPA? 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(4) The projected and actual production volumes for the model year with a point of first retail 
sale in the United States, as described in §1054.701(i).  For fuel tanks, state the production 
volume in terms of surface area and production volume for each fuel tank configuration and 
state the total surface area for the emission family.  If you changed an FEL during the model 
year, identify the actual production volume associated with each FEL. 
* * * * * 
 
Subpart I—[Amended] 
 
141.  Section 1054.801 is amended by revising the definitions for “Oxides of nitrogen” 
and “Total hydrocarbon equivalent” and adding a definition for “Point of first retail sale” 
in alphabetical order to read as follows: 
* * * * * 
 Oxides of nitrogen has the meaning given in 40 CFR part 1065.1001 
* * * * * 
 Point of first retail sale means the location at which the initial retail sale occurs.  This 
generally means an equipment dealership, but may also include an engine seller or distributor in 
cases where loose engines are sold to the general public for uses such as replacement engines.  
* * * * * 
 Total hydrocarbon equivalent has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1065.1001.  This 
generally means the sum of the carbon mass contributions of non-oxygenated hydrocarbons, 
alcohols and aldehydes, or other organic compounds that are measured separately as contained in 
a gas sample, expressed as exhaust hydrocarbon from petroleum-fueled engines.  The hydrogen-
to-carbon mass ratio of the equivalent hydrocarbon is 1.85:1.

Stationary Equipment 
 
142.  The authority citation for part 1060 continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. 
 
Subpart B—[Amended] 
 
143.  Section 1060.103 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
§1060.103 What permeation emission control requirements apply for fuel tanks? 
* * * * * 
(e) Fuel caps may be certified separately relative to the permeation emission standard in 
paragraph (b) of this section using the test procedures specified in §1060.521.  Fuel caps certified 
alone do not need to meet the emission standard.  Rather, fuel caps would be certified with a 
Family Emission Limit, which is used for demonstrating that fuel tanks meet the emission 
standard as described in §1060.520(b)(5).  For the purposes of this paragraph (e), gaskets or O-
rings that are produced as part of an assembly with the fuel cap are considered part of the fuel 
cap. 
* * * * * 
 
144.  Section 1060.135 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(5) to read as follows: 
§1060.135  How must I label and identify the engines and equipment I produce? 
* * * * * 
(a)* * * 
(5) Readily visible in the final installation.  It may be under a hinged door or other readily 
opened cover.  It may not be hidden by any cover attached with screws or any similar 
designs.  Labels on marine vessels (except personal watercraft) must be visible from the 
helm. 
* * * * * 
 
 
145.  Section 1060.137 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) to read as 
follows: 
§1060.137  How must I label and identify the fuel-system components I produce? 
* * * * * 
(a) * * * 
(4) Fuel caps, as described in this paragraph (a)(4).  Fuel caps must be labeled if they are 
separately certified under §1060.103 or if the diurnal control system requires that the fuel 
tank hold pressure.  Fuel caps must also be labeled if they are attached directly to mounted 
directly on the fuel tank, unless the fuel tank is certified based on a worst-case fuel cap. 
(5) Replaceable pressure-relief assemblies.  This does not apply if the component is integral 
to the fuel tank or fuel cap.  If the assembly is too small to be properly labeled, you may omit 
the label, provided that you identify the part numbers in your maintenance and installation 
instructions. 
* * * * * 
 
 304
Subpart F—[Amended] 
 
 
146.  Section 1060.515 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: 
§1060.515  How do I test EPA Nonroad Fuel Lines and EPA Cold-Weather Fuel Lines for 
permeation emissions? 
* * * * * 
(c) Measure fuel line permeation emissions using the equipment and procedures for weight-loss 
testing specified in SAE J30 or SAE J1527 (incorporated by reference in §1060.810).  Start the 
measurement procedure within 8 hours after draining and refilling the fuel line.  Perform the 
emission test over a sampling period of 14 days.  Determine your final emission result based on 
the highest measured valued over the 14-day period. 
* * * * * 
 
147.  Section 1060.520 is amended as follows: 
a. By adding paragraph (a)(4). 
b. By removing and reserving paragraph (b)(3). 
c. By revising paragraphs (b)(5)(ii)(B), (d)(8), and (d)(10). 
§1060.520  How do I test fuel tanks for permeation emissions? 
* * * * * 
(a) * * * 
(4) Perform durability cycles on fuel caps intended for use with handheld equipment by 
putting the fuel cap on and taking it off 300 times.  Tighten the fuel cap each time in a way 
that represents the typical in-use experience. 
(b) * * * 
(3) [Reserved] 
* * * * * 
(5) * * * 
(ii) * * * 
(B) You may seal the fuel inlet with a nonpermeable covering if you separately 
measure the permeation account for permeation emissions from the fuel cap.  This 
may involve a separate measurement of permeation emissions from a worst-case fuel 
cap as described in §1060.521.  This may also involve specifying a worst-case Family 
Emission Limit based on separately certified fuel caps as described in §1060.103(e). 
* * * * * 
(d) * * * 
(8) Measure weight loss daily by retaring the balance using the reference tank and weighing 
the sealed test tank.  Calculate the cumulative weight loss in g/m2/daygramsfor each 
measurement.  [If result is at or below 0.1, stop testing after ten days.  If the result is above 
0.1, calculate...]  Calculate the coefficient of determination, r2, based on a linear plot of 
cumulative weight loss vs. test days as described in 40 CFR 1065.602(k).  Continue testing 
for ten full days or, if r2 is below 0.95,  continue testing until r2 is at or above 0.95.  If r2 is 
not at or above 0.95 within 20 days of testing, discontinue the test and precondition the fuel 
tank further until it has stabilized emission levels, then repeat the testing.  The daily 
measurements must be at approximately the same time each day.  You may omit up to two 
daily measurements in any seven-day period. 
 305
* * * * * 
(10) Determine your final emission result based on the cumulative weight loss measured on 
the final day of testing.  Round yourthis result to the same number of decimal places as the 
emission standard. 
* * * * * 
 
Subpart G—[Amended] 
 
148.  Section 1060.601 is amended by adding paragraph (h) to read as follows: 
§1060.601 How do the prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101 apply with respect to the 
requirements of this part? 
* * * * * 
(h) If equipment manufacturers hold certificates of conformity for their equipment but they use 
only fuel-system components that have been certified by other companies, they may satisfy their 
defect-reporting obligations by tracking the information described in 40 CFR 1068.501(b)(1) 
related to possible defects, reporting this information to the appropriate component 
manufacturers, and keeping these records for eight years.  Such equipment manufacturers will 
not be considered in violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(6) for failing to perform investigations, 
make calculations, or submit reports to EPA as specified in 40 CFR 1068.501.  See §1060.5(a).  
 
Subpart I—[Amended] 
 
149.  Section 1060.801 is amended by revising the definitions for “Detachable fuel 
line” and “Sealed” and adding definitions for “Installed marine fuel line” and “Portable 
marine fuel line” to read as follows: 
§1060.801  What definitions apply to this part? 
* * * * * 
 Detachable fuel line means a fuel line or fuel line assembly intended to be used with a 
portable nonroad fuel tank and which is connected by special fittings to the fuel tank and/or 
engine for easy disassembly.  Fuel lines that require a wrench or other tools to disconnect are not 
considered detachable fuel lines.  Fuel lines that are labeled or marketed as USCG Type B1 fuel 
line as specified in 33 CFR 183.540 are not considered detachable fuel lines if they are sold to 
the ultimate purchaser without quick-connect fittings or similar hardware. 
* * * * * 
 Installed marine fuel line means a fuel line designed for delivering fuel to a Marine SI 
engine, excluding portable marine fuel line. 
* * * * * 
 Portable marine fuel line means a detachable fuel line that is used or intended to be used 
to supply fuel to a marine engine during operation.  This also includes any fuel line labeled or 
marketed at USCG Type B1 fuel line as specified in 33 CFR 183.540, whether or not it includes 
detachable connecting hardware; this is often called universal fuel line. 
* * * * * 
 Sealed means lacking openings to the atmosphere that would allow a measurable amount 
of liquid or vapor to leak out under normal operating pressures or other pressures specified in 
this part.  For example, you may generally establish a maximum value for operating pressures 
based on the highest pressure you would observe from an installed fuel tank during continuous 
 306
equipment operation on a sunny day with ambient temperatures of 35°C. A fuel system may be 
considered to have no measurable leak if it does not release bubbles when held underwater at the 
identified pressure for 60 seconds.  This determination presumes the use of good engineering 
judgment; for example, it would not be appropriate to test the fuel tank such that small leaks 
would avoid detection by collecting in a cavity created by holding the tank with a certain 
orientation.  Sealed fuel systems may have openings for emission controls or for fuel lines 
needed to route fuel to the engine.

PART 1065—ENGINE-TESTING PROCEDURES 
 
150.  The authority citation for part 1065 continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. 
 
Subpart A-- [Revised] 
 
151.  Section 1065.1 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: 
§1065.1 Applicability. 
* * * * * 
(d) Paragraph (a) of this section identifies the parts of the CFR that define emission standards 
and other requirements for particular types of engines.  In this part, we refer to each of these 
other parts generically as the ''standard-setting part.''  For example, 40 CFR part 1051 is always 
the standard-setting part for snowmobiles.  Note that while 40 CFR part 86 is the standard-setting 
part for heavy-duty highway engines, this refers specifically to 40 CFR part 86, subpart A, and to 
certain portions of 40 CFR part 86, subpart N, as described in 40 CFR 86.1301. 
* * * * * 
 
152.  Section 1065.2 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: 
§1065.2 Submitting information to EPA under this part. 
(a) You are responsible for statements and information in your applications for certification, 
requests for approved procedures, selective enforcement audits, laboratory audits, production-
line test reports, field test reports, or any other statements you make to us related to this part 
1065.  If you provide statements or information to someone for submission to EPA, you are 
responsible for these statements and information as if you had submitted them to EPA yourself.  
(b) In the standard-setting part and in 40 CFR 1068.101, we describe your obligation to report 
truthful and complete information and the consequences of failing to meet this obligation.  See 
also 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 42 U.S.C. 7413(c)(2).  This obligation applies whether you submit this 
information directly to EPA or through someone else. 
* * * * * 
 
153.  Section 1065.10 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(7) to read as 
follows: 
§1065.10 Other procedures. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
 307
(2) You may request to use special procedures if your engine cannot be tested using the specified 
procedures.  For example, this may apply if your engine cannot operate on the specified duty 
cycle.  In this case, tell us in writing why you cannot satisfactorily test your engine using this 
part's procedures and ask to use a different approach.  We will approve your request if we 
determine that it would produce emission measurements that represent in-use operation and we 
determine that it can be used to show compliance with the requirements of the standard-setting 
part.  Where we approve special procedures that differ substantially from the specified 
procedures, we may preclude you from participating in averaging, banking, and trading with the 
affected engine families. 
* * * * * 
(7) You may request to use alternate procedures that are equivalent to the allowed procedures, or 
procedures that are more accurate or more precise than the allowed procedures.  The following 
provisions apply to requests for alternate procedures: 
(i) Applications. Follow the instructions in §1065.12. 
(ii) Submission. Submit requests in writing to the Designated Compliance Officer. 
(iii) Notification. We may approve your request by telling you directly, or we may issue 
guidance announcing our approval of a specific alternate procedure, which would make 
additional requests for approval unnecessary. 
* * * * * 
 
154.  Section 1065.15 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: 
§1065.15 Overview of procedures for laboratory and field testing. 
* * * * * 
(c) We generally set brake-specific emission standards over test intervals and/or duty cycles, as 
follows: 
(1) Engine operation.  Testing may involve measuring emissions and work in a laboratory-type 
environment or in the field, as described in paragraph (f) of this section.  For most laboratory 
testing, the engine is operated over one or more duty cycles specified in the standard-setting part.  
However, laboratory testing may also include non-duty cycle testing (such as simulation of field 
testing in a laboratory).  For field testing, the engine is operated under normal in-use operation.  
The standard-setting part specifies how test intervals are defined for field testing.  Refer to the 
definitions of “duty cycle” and “test interval” in §1065.1001.  Note that a single duty cycle may 
have multiple test intervals and require weighting of results from multiple test intervals to 
calculate a composite brake-specific emissions value to compare to the standard.    
(2) Constituent determination.  Determine the total mass of each constituent over a test interval 
by selecting from the following methods: 
(i) Continuous sampling.  In continuous sampling, measure the constituent’s concentration 
continuously from raw or dilute exhaust.  Multiply this concentration by the continuous (raw or 
dilute) flow rate at the emission sampling location to determine the constituent’s flow rate.  Sum 
the constituent’s flow rate continuously over the test interval.  This sum is the total mass of the 
emitted constituent. 
(ii) Batch sampling.  In batch sampling, continuously extract and store a sample of raw or dilute 
exhaust for later measurement.  Extract a sample proportional to the raw or dilute exhaust flow 
rate.  You may extract and store a proportional sample of exhaust in an appropriate container, 
such as a bag, and then measure HC, CO, and NOx concentrations in the container after the test 
interval.  You may deposit PM from proportionally extracted exhaust onto an appropriate 
 308
substrate, such as a filter.  In this case, divide the PM by the amount of filtered exhaust to 
calculate the PM concentration.  Multiply batch sampled concentrations by the total (raw or 
dilute) flow from which it was extracted during the test interval.  This product is the total mass of 
the emitted constituent. 
(iii) Combined sampling. You may use continuous and batch sampling simultaneously during a 
test interval, as follows: 
(A) You may use continuous sampling for some constituents and batch sampling for others. 
(B) You may use continuous and batch sampling for a single constituent, with one being a 
redundant measurement.  See §1065.201 for more information on redundant measurements. 
(3) Work determination.  Determine work over a test interval by one of the following methods: 
(i) Speed and torque.  Synchronously multiply speed and brake torque to calculate instantaneous 
values for engine brake power.  Sum engine brake power over a test interval to determine total 
work. 
(ii) Fuel consumed and brake-specific fuel consumption.  Directly measure fuel consumed or 
calculate it with chemical balances of the fuel, intake air, and exhaust.  To calculate fuel 
consumed by a chemical balance, you must also measure either intake-air flow rate or exhaust 
flow rate.  Divide the fuel consumed during a test interval by the brake-specific fuel consumption 
to determine work over the test interval.  For laboratory testing, calculate the brake-specific fuel 
consumption using fuel consumed and speed and torque over a test interval.  For field testing, 
refer to the standard-setting part and §1065.915 for selecting an appropriate value for brake-
specific fuel consumption.

Subpart B--- [Revised] 
 
155.  Section 1065.125 is amended by revising paragraphs (c) and (e) to read as 
follows: 
§1065.125 Engine intake air.  
* * * * * 
(c) Maintain the temperature of intake air upstream of all engine components within the range of 
allowable ambient temperatures (or other range specified by the standard-setting part), consistent 
with the provisions of §1065.10(c)(1). 
* * * * * 
(e) This paragraph (e) includes provisions for simulating charge-air cooling in the laboratory.  
This approach is described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.  Limits on using this approach are 
described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section. 
(1) Use a charge-air cooling system with a total intake-air capacity that represents production 
engines’ in-use installation.  Design any laboratory charge-air cooling system to minimize 
accumulation of condensate.  Drain any accumulated condensate and completely close all drains 
before starting a duty cycle.  Keep the drains closed during the emission test.  Maintain coolant 
conditions as follows: 
(i) Maintain a coolant temperature of at least 20 °C at the inlet to the charge-air cooler 
throughout testing.  We recommend maintaining a coolant temperature of 25 ± 5ºC at the inlet of 
the charge-air cooler. 
(ii) At the engine conditions specified by the manufacturer, set the coolant flow rate to achieve 
an air temperature within ±5 °C of the value specified by the manufacturer after the charge-air 
cooler’s outlet.  Measure the air-outlet temperature at the location specified by the manufacturer.  
Use this coolant flow rate set point throughout testing. If the engine manufacturer does not 
specify engine conditions or the corresponding charge-air cooler air outlet temperature, set the 
coolant flow rate at maximum engine power to achieve a charge-air cooler air outlet temperature 
that represents in-use operation. 
(iii) If the engine manufacturer specifies pressure-drop limits across the charge-air cooling 
system, ensure that the pressure drop across the charge-air cooling system at engine conditions 
specified by the manufacturer is within the manufacturer’s specified limit(s).  Measure the 
pressure drop at the manufacturer’s specified locations. 
(2) Using a constant flow rate as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may result in 
unrepresentative overcooling of the intake air.  The provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) apply 
instead of  the provisions of §1065.10(c)(1) for this simulation.  Our allowance to cool intake air 
as specified in this paragraph (e) does not affect your liability for field testing or for laboratory 
testing that is done in a way that better represents in-use operation.  Where we determine that this 
allowance adversely affects your ability to demonstrate that your engines would comply with 
emission standards under in-use conditions, we may require you to use more sophisticated 
setpoints and controls of charge-air pressure drop, coolant temperature, and flow rate to achieve 
more representative results.(3) This approach does not apply for field testing.  You may not 
correct measured emission levels from field testing to account for any differences caused by the 
simulated cooling in the laboratory. 
 
156.  Section 1065.140 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(6), (e) introductory text, 
and (e)(4) to read as follows: 
 310
§1065.140 Dilution for gaseous and PM constituents. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
(6) Aqueous condensation.  To ensure that you measure a flow that corresponds to a measured 
concentration, you may either prevent aqueous condensation throughout the dilution tunnel or 
you may allow aqueous condensation to occur and then measure humidity at the flow meter inlet.  
You may heat or insulate the dilution tunnel walls, as well as the bulk stream tubing downstream 
of the tunnel to prevent aqueous condensation.  Calculations in §1065.645 and §1065.650 
account for either method of addressing humidity in the diluted exhaust. Note that preventing 
aqueous condensation involves more than keeping pure water in a vapor phase (see §1065.1001). 
* * * * * 
(e) Dilution air temperature, dilution ratio, residence time, and temperature control of PM 
samples.  Dilute PM samples at least once upstream of transfer lines.  You may dilute PM 
samples upstream of a transfer line using full-flow dilution, or partial-flow dilution immediately 
downstream of a PM probe.  In the case of partial-flow dilution, you may have up to 26 cm of 
insulated length between the end of the probe and the dilution stage, but we recommend that the 
length be as short as practical.  The intent of these specifications is to minimize heat transfer to 
or from the emission sample before the final stage of dilution, other than the heat you may need 
to add to prevent aqueous condensation.  This is accomplished by initially cooling the sample 
through dilution.  Configure dilution systems as follows: 
* * * * * 
(4) Control sample temperature to a (47 ±5) °C tolerance, as measured anywhere within 20 cm 
upstream or downstream of the PM storage media (such as a filter).  Measure this temperature 
with a bare-wire junction thermocouple with wires that are (0.500 ±0.025) mm diameter, or with 
another suitable instrument that has equivalent performance. 
 
157.  Section 1065.145 is revised to read as follows: 
§1065.145 Gaseous and PM probes, transfer lines, and sampling system components. 
(a) Continuous and batch sampling.  Determine the total mass of each constituent with 
continuous or batch sampling, as described in §1065.15(c)(2).  Both types of sampling systems 
have probes, transfer lines, and other sampling system components that are described in this 
section. 
(b) Options for engines with multiple exhaust stacks.  Measure emissions from a test engine as 
described in this paragraph (b) if it has multiple exhaust stacks.  You may choose to use different 
measurement procedures for different pollutants under this paragraph (b) for a given test.  For 
purposes of this part 1065, the test engine includes all the devices related to converting the 
chemical energy in the fuel to the engine’s mechanical output energy.  This may or may not 
involve vehicle- or equipment-based devices.  For example, all of an engine’s cylinders are 
considered to be part of the test engine even if the exhaust is divided into separate exhaust stacks.  
As another example, all the cylinders of a diesel-electric locomotive are considered to be part of 
the test engine even if they transmit power through separate output shafts, such as might occur 
with multiple engine-generator sets working in tandem.  Use one of the following procedures to 
measure emissions with multiple exhaust stacks: 
(1) Route the exhaust flow from the multiple stacks into a single flow as described in 
§1065.130(c)(6).  Sample and measure emissions after the exhaust streams are mixed.  Calculate 
the emissions as a single sample from the entire engine.  We recommend this as the preferred 
 311
option, since it requires only a single measurement and calculation of the exhaust molar flow for 
the entire engine. 
(2) Sample and measure emissions from each stack and calculate emissions separately for each 
stack.  Add the mass (or mass rate) emissions from each stack to calculate the emissions from the 
entire engine.  Testing under this paragraph (b)(2) requires measuring or calculating the exhaust 
molar flow for each stack separately.  If the exhaust molar flow in each stack cannot be 
calculated from combustion air flow(s), fuel flow(s), and measured gaseous emissions, and it is 
impractical to measure the exhaust molar flows directly, you may alternatively proportion the 
engine’s calculated total exhaust molar flow rate (where the flow is calculated using combustion 
air mass flow(s), fuel mass flow(s), and emissions concentrations) based on exhaust molar flow 
measurements in each stack using a less accurate, non-traceable method.  For example, you may 
use a total pressure probe and static pressure measurement in each stack.  
(3) Sample and measure emissions from one stack and repeat the duty cycle as needed to collect 
emissions from each stack separately.  Calculate the emissions from each stack and add the 
separate measurements to calculate the mass (or mass rate) emissions from the entire engine.  
Testing under this paragraph (b)(3) requires measuring or calculating the exhaust molar flow for 
each stack separately.  You may alternatively proportion the engine’s calculated total exhaust 
molar flow rate based on calculation and measurement limitations as described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.  Use the average of the engine’s total power or work values from the 
multiple test runs to calculate brake-specific emissions.  Divide the total mass (or mass rate) of 
each emission by the average power (or work).  You may alternatively use the engine power or 
work associated with the corresponding stack during each test run if these values can be 
determined for each stack separately.  
(4) Sample and measure emissions from each stack separately and calculate emissions for the 
entire engine based on the stack with the highest concentration.  Testing under this paragraph 
(b)(4) requires only a single exhaust flow measurement or calculation for the entire engine.  You 
may determine which stack has the highest concentration by performing multiple test runs, 
reviewing the results of earlier tests, or using good engineering judgment.  Note that the highest 
concentration of different pollutants may occur in different stacks.  Note also that the stack with 
the highest concentration of a pollutant during a test interval for field testing may be a different 
stack than the one you identified based on average concentrations over a duty cycle.   
(5) Sample emissions from each stack separately and combine the wet sample streams from each 
stack proportionally to the exhaust molar flows in each stack.  Measure the emission 
concentrations and calculate the emissions for the entire engine based on these weighted 
concentrations.  Testing under this paragraph (b)(5) requires measuring or calculating the 
exhaust molar flow for each stack separately during the test run to proportion the sample streams 
from each stack.  If it is impractical to measure the exhaust molar flows directly, you may 
alternatively proportion the wet sample streams based on less accurate, non-traceable flow 
methods.  For example, you may use a total pressure probe and static pressure measurement in 
each stack.  The following restrictions apply for testing under this paragraph (b)(5):   
(i) You must use an accurate, traceable measurement or calculation of the engine’s total exhaust 
molar flow rate for calculating the mass of emissions from the entire engine.   
(ii) You may dry the single, combined, proportional sample stream; you may not dry the sample 
streams from each stack separately. 
(iii) You must measure and proportion the sample flows from each stack with active flow 
controls.  For PM sampling, you must measure and proportion the diluted sample flows from 
 312
each stack with active flow controls that use only smooth walls with no sudden change in cross-
sectional area.  For example, you may control the dilute exhaust PM sample flows using 
electrically conductive vinyl tubing and a control device that pinches the tube over a long enough 
transition length so no flow separation occurs.   
(iv) For PM sampling, the transfer lines from each stack must be joined so the angle of the 
joining flows is 12.5 º or less.  Note that the exhaust manifold must meet the same specifications 
as the transfer line according to paragraph (d) of this section. 
(6) Sample emissions from each stack separately and combine the wet sample streams from each 
stack equally.  Measure the emission concentrations and calculate the emissions for the entire 
engine based on these measured concentrations.  Testing under this paragraph (b)(6) assumes 
that the raw-exhaust and sample flows are the same for each stack.  The following restrictions 
apply for testing under this paragraph (b)(6):   
(i) You must measure and demonstrate that the sample flow from each stack is within 5% of the 
value from the stack with the highest sample flow.  You may alternatively ensure that the stacks 
have equal flow rates without measuring sample flows by designing a passive sampling system 
that meets the following requirements: 
(A) The probes and transfer line branches must be symmetrical, have equal lengths and 
diameters, have the same number of bends, and have no filters. 
(B) If probes are designed such that they are sensitive to stack velocity, the stack velocity must 
be similar at each probe.  For example, a static pressure probe used for gaseous sampling is not 
sensitive to stack velocity. 
(C) The stack static pressure must be the same at each probe.  You can meet this requirement by 
placing probes at the end of stacks that are vented to atmosphere. 
(D) For PM sampling, the transfer lines from each stack must be joined so the angle of the 
joining flows is 12.5 º or less.  Note that the exhaust manifold must meet the same specifications 
as the transfer line according to paragraph (d) of this section. 
(ii) You may use the procedure in this paragraph (b)(6) only if you perform an analysis showing 
that the resulting error due to imbalanced stack flows and concentrations is either at or below 2 
%.  You may alternatively show that the resulting error does not impact your ability to 
demonstrate compliance with applicable standards.  For example, you may use less accurate, 
non-traceable measurements of emission concentrations and molar flow in each stack and 
demonstrate that the imbalances in flows and concentrations cause 2% or less error. 
(iii) For a two-stack engine, you may use the procedure in this paragraph (b)(6) only if you can 
show that the stack with the higher flow has the lower average concentration for each pollutant 
over the duty cycle. 
(iv) You must use an accurate, traceable measurement or calculation of the engine’s total exhaust 
molar flow rate for calculating the mass of emissions from the entire engine.   
(v) You may dry the single, equally combined, sample stream; you may not dry the sample 
streams from each stack separately. 
(vi) You may determine your exhaust flow rates with a chemical balance of exhaust gas 
concentrations and either intake air flow or fuel flow.(c) Gaseous and PM sample probes.  A 
probe is the first fitting in a sampling system.  It protrudes into a raw or diluted exhaust stream to 
extract a sample, such that its inside and outside surfaces are in contact with the exhaust.  A 
sample is transported out of a probe into a transfer line, as described in paragraph (d) of this 
section.  The following provisions apply to sample probes:  
 313
(1) Probe design and construction.  Use sample probes with inside surfaces of 300 series stainless 
steel or, for raw exhaust sampling, use any nonreactive material capable of withstanding raw 
exhaust temperatures.  Locate sample probes where constituents are mixed to their mean sample 
concentration.  Take into account the mixing of any crankcase emissions that may be routed into 
the raw exhaust.  Locate each probe to minimize interference with the flow to other probes.  We 
recommend that all probes remain free from influences of boundary layers, wakes, and eddies—
especially near the outlet of a raw-exhaust tailpipe where unintended dilution might occur.  Make 
sure that purging or back-flushing of a probe does not influence another probe during testing.  
You may use a single probe to extract a sample of more than one constituent as long as the probe 
meets all the specifications for each constituent. 
(2) Gaseous sample probes.  Use either single-port or multi-port probes for sampling gaseous 
emissions.  You may orient these probes in any direction relative to the raw or diluted exhaust 
flow.  For some probes, you must control sample temperatures, as follows: 
(i) For probes that extract NOx from diluted exhaust, control the probe’s wall temperature to 
prevent aqueous condensation.  
(ii) For probes that extract hydrocarbons for THC or NMHC analysis from the diluted exhaust of 
compression-ignition engines, 2-stroke spark-ignition engines, or 4-stroke spark-ignition engines 
below 19 kW, we recommend heating the probe to minimize hydrocarbon contamination 
consistent with good engineering judgment.  If you routinely fail the contamination check in the 
1065.520 pretest check, we recommend heating the probe section to approximately 190 °C to 
minimize contamination. 
(3)  PM sample probes.  Use PM probes with a single opening at the end.  Orient PM probes to 
face directly upstream.  If you shield a PM probe’s opening with a PM pre-classifier such as a 
hat, you may not use the preclassifier we specify in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.  We 
recommend sizing the inside diameter of PM probes to approximate isokinetic sampling at the 
expected mean flow rate. 
(d) Transfer lines.  You may use transfer lines to transport an extracted sample from a probe to 
an analyzer, storage medium, or dilution system, noting certain restrictions for PM sampling in 
§1065.140(e).  Minimize the length of all transfer lines by locating analyzers, storage media, and 
dilution systems as close to probes as practical.  We recommend that you minimize the number 
of bends in transfer lines and that you maximize the radius of any unavoidable bend.  Avoid 
using 90 °elbows, tees, and cross-fittings in transfer lines.  Where such connections and fittings 
are necessary, take steps, using good engineering judgment, to ensure that you meet the 
temperature tolerances in this paragraph (d).  This may involve measuring temperature at various 
locations within transfer lines and fittings.  You may use a single transfer line to transport a 
sample of more than one constituent, as long as the transfer line meets all the specifications for 
each constituent.  The following construction and temperature tolerances apply to transfer lines: 
(1) Gaseous samples.  Use transfer lines with inside surfaces of 300 series stainless steel, PTFE, 
VitonTM, or any other material that you demonstrate has better properties for emission sampling.  
For raw exhaust sampling, use a non-reactive material capable of withstanding raw exhaust 
temperatures. You may use in-line filters if they do not react with exhaust constituents and if the 
filter and its housing meet the same temperature requirements as the transfer lines, as follows: 
(i) For NOx transfer lines upstream of either an NO2-to-NO converter that meets the 
specifications of §1065.378 or a chiller that meets the specifications of §1065.376, maintain a 
sample temperature that prevents aqueous condensation. 
 314
(ii) For THC transfer lines for testing compression-ignition engines, 2-stroke spark-ignition 
engines, or 4-stroke spark-ignition engines below 19 kW, maintain a wall temperature tolerance 
throughout the entire line of (191 ±11) °C.  If you sample from raw exhaust, you may connect an 
unheated, insulated transfer line directly to a probe.  Design the length and insulation of the 
transfer line to cool the highest expected raw exhaust temperature to no lower than 191 °C, as 
measured at the transfer line’s outlet.  For dilute sampling, you may use a transition zone 
between the probe and transfer line of up to 92 cm to allow your wall temperature to transition to 
(191 ±11) °C. 
(2) PM samples.  We recommend heated transfer lines or a heated enclosure to minimize 
temperature differences between transfer lines and exhaust constituents.  Use transfer lines that 
are inert with respect to PM and are electrically conductive on the inside surfaces.  We 
recommend using PM transfer lines made of 300 series stainless steel.  Electrically ground the 
inside surface of PM transfer lines. 
(e) Optional sample-conditioning components for gaseous sampling.  You may use the following 
sample-conditioning components to prepare gaseous samples for analysis, as long as you do not 
install or use them in a way that adversely affects your ability to show that your engines comply 
with all applicable gaseous emission standards. 
(1) NO2-to-NO converter.  You may use an NO2-to-NO converter that meets the efficiency-
performance check specified in §1065.378 at any point upstream of a NOx analyzer, sample bag, 
or other storage medium. 
(2) Sample dryer.  You may use either type of sample dryer described in this paragraph (e)(2) to 
decrease the effects of water on gaseous emission measurements. You may not use a chemical 
dryer, or use dryers upstream of PM sample filters. 
(i) Osmotic-membrane.  You may use an osmotic-membrane dryer upstream of any gaseous 
analyzer or storage medium, as long as it meets the temperature specifications in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section.  Because osmotic-membrane dryers may deteriorate after prolonged 
exposure to certain exhaust constituents, consult with the membrane manufacturer regarding 
your application before incorporating an osmotic-membrane dryer.  Monitor the dewpoint, Tdew, 
and absolute pressure, ptotal, downstream of an osmotic-membrane dryer.  You may use 
continuously recorded values of Tdew and ptotal in the amount of water calculations specified in 
§1065.645.  If you do not continuously record these values, you may use their peak values 
observed during a test or their alarm setpoints as constant values in the calculations specified in 
§1065.645.  You may also use a nominal ptotal, which you may estimate as the dryer’s lowest 
absolute pressure expected during testing. 
(ii) Thermal chiller.  You may use a thermal chiller upstream of some gas analyzers and storage 
media.  You may not use a thermal chiller upstream of a THC measurement system for 
compression-ignition engines, 2-stroke spark-ignition engines, or 4-stroke spark-ignition engines 
below 19 kW.  If you use a thermal chiller upstream of an NO2-to-NO converter or in a sampling 
system without an NO2-to-NO converter, the chiller must meet the NO2 loss-performance check 
specified in §1065.376.  Monitor the dewpoint, Tdew, and absolute pressure, ptotal, downstream of 
a thermal chiller.  You may use continuously recorded values of Tdew and ptotal in the emission 
calculations specified in §1065.650.  If you do not continuously record these values, you may use 
the maximum temperature and minimum pressure values observed during a test or the high alarm 
temperature setpoint and the low alarm pressure setpoint as constant values in the amount of 
water calculations specified in §1065.645.  You may also use a nominal ptotal, which you may 
estimate as the dryer’s lowest absolute pressure expected during testing.  If it is valid to assume 
 315
the degree of saturation in the thermal chiller, you may calculate Tdew based on the known chiller 
performance and continuous monitoring of chiller temperature, Tchiller.  If you do not 
continuously record values of Tchiller, you may use its peak value observed during a test, or its 
alarm setpoint, as a constant value to determine a constant amount of water according to 
§1065.645.  If it is valid to assume that Tchiller is equal to Tdew, you may use Tchiller in lieu of Tdew 
according to §1065.645.  If it is valid to assume a constant temperature offset between Tchiller and 
Tdew, due to a known and fixed amount of sample reheat between the chiller outlet and the 
temperature measurement location, you may factor in this assumed temperature offset value into 
emission calculations.  If we ask for it, you must show by engineering analysis or by data the 
validity of any assumptions allowed by this paragraph (e)(2)(ii).  
(3) Sample pumps.  You may use sample pumps upstream of an analyzer or storage medium for 
any gas.  Use sample pumps with inside surfaces of 300 series stainless steel, PTFE, or any other 
material that you demonstrate has better properties for emission sampling.  For some sample 
pumps, you must control temperatures, as follows: 
(i) If you use a NOx sample pump upstream of either an NO2-to-NO converter that meets 
§1065.378 or a chiller that meets §1065.376, it must be heated to prevent aqueous condensation. 
(ii) For testing compression-ignition engines, 2-stroke spark-ignition engines, or 4-stroke spark-
ignition engines below 19 kW,  if you use a THC sample pump upstream of a THC analyzer or 
storage medium, its inner surfaces must be heated to a tolerance of (191 ±11) °C. 
(4) Ammonia Scrubber.  You may use ammonia scrubbers for any or all gaseous sampling 
systems to prevent interference with NH3, poisoning of the NO2-to-NO converter, and deposits in 
the sampling system or analyzers.  Follow the ammonia scrubber manufacturer’s 
recommendations or use good engineering judgment in applying ammonia scrubbers. 
(f) Optional sample-conditioning components for PM sampling.  You may use the following 
sample-conditioning components to prepare PM samples for analysis, as long as you do not 
install or use them in a way that adversely affects your ability to show that your engines comply 
with the applicable PM emission standards.  You may condition PM samples to minimize 
positive and negative biases to PM results, as follows: 
(1) PM preclassifier.  You may use a PM preclassifier to remove large-diameter particles.  The 
PM preclassifier may be either an inertial impactor or a cyclonic separator.  It must be 
constructed of 300 series stainless steel.  The preclassifier must be rated to remove at least 50 % 
of PM at an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm and no more than 1 % of PM at an aerodynamic 
diameter of 1 μm over the range of flow rates for which you use it.  Follow the preclassifier 
manufacturer’s instructions for any periodic servicing that may be necessary to prevent a buildup 
of PM.  Install the preclassifier in the dilution system downstream of the last dilution stage.  
Configure the preclassifier outlet with a means of bypassing any PM sample media so the 
preclassifier flow may be stabilized before starting a test.  Locate PM sample media within 75 
cm downstream of the preclassifier’s exit.  You may not use this preclassifier if you use a PM 
probe that already has a preclassifier.  For example, if you use a hat-shaped preclassifier that is 
located immediately upstream of the probe in such a way that it forces the sample flow to change 
direction before entering the probe, you may not use any other preclassifier in your PM sampling 
system. 
(2) Other components.  You may request to use other PM conditioning components upstream of 
a PM preclassifier, such as components that condition humidity or remove gaseous-phase 
hydrocarbons from the diluted exhaust stream.  You may use such components only if we 
approve them under §1065.10.

160.  Section 1065.307 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(6), (d), and (e)(3)(ii) and 
Table 1 to read as follows: 
§1065.307 Linearity verification. 
* * * * * 
(c) * * * 
(6) For all measured quantities, use instrument manufacturer recommendations and good 
engineering judgment to select reference values, yrefi, that cover a range of values that you expect 
would prevent extrapolation beyond these values during emission testing.  We recommend 
selecting a zero reference signal as one of the reference values of the linearity verification.  For 
stand-alone pressure, temperature, and dewpoint linearity verifications, we recommend at least 
three reference values.  For all other linearity verifications select at least ten reference values. 
* * * * * 
(d) Reference signals.  This paragraph (d) describes recommended methods for generating 
reference values for the linearity-verification protocol in paragraph (c) of this section.  Use 
reference values that simulate actual values, or introduce an actual value and measure it with a 
reference-measurement system.  In the latter case, the reference value is the value reported by the 
reference-measurement system.  Reference values and reference-measurement systems must be 
NIST-traceable.  We recommend using calibration reference quantities that are NIST-traceable 
within 0.5 % uncertainty, if not specified otherwise in other sections of this part 1065.  Use the 
following recommended methods to generate reference values or use good engineering judgment 
to select a different reference: 
(1) Speed.  Run the engine or dynamometer at a series of steady-state speeds and use a strobe, a 
photo tachometer, or a laser tachometer to record reference speeds. 
 319
(2) Torque.  Use a series of calibration weights and a calibration lever arm to simulate engine 
torque.  You may instead use the engine or dynamometer itself to generate a nominal torque that 
is measured by a reference load cell or proving ring in series with the torque-measurement 
system.  In this case use the reference load cell measurement as the reference value.  Refer to 
§1065.310 for a torque-calibration procedure similar to the linearity verification in this section. 
(3) Electrical power.  Use a controlled source of current and a watt-hour standard reference 
meter.  Complete calibration systems that contain a current source and a reference watt-hour 
meter are commonly used in the electrical power distribution industry and are therefore 
commercially available. 
* * * * * 
(e) * * * 
(3) * * * 
(ii) For linearity verification of torque on the engine’s primary output shaft, Tmax refers to the 
manufacturer’s specified engine torque peak value of the lowest torque engine to be tested.

161.  Section 1065.309 is amended by revising paragraph (d)(2) to read as follows: 
§1065.309 Continuous gas analyzer system-response and updating-recording verification—
for gas analyzers continuously compensated for other gas species. 
* * * * * 
(d) * * * 
(2) Equipment setup.  We recommend using minimal lengths of gas transfer lines between all 
connections and fast-acting three-way valves (2 inlets, 1 outlet) to control the flow of zero and 
blended span gases to the sample system’s probe inlet or a tee near the outlet of the probe.  
Normally the gas flow rate is higher than the probe sample flow rate and the excess is 
overflowed out the inlet of the probe.  If the gas flow rate is lower than the probe flow rate, the 
gas concentrations must be adjusted to account for the dilution from ambient air drawn into the 
probe.  Select span gases for the species being continuously combined, other than H2O.  Select 
concentrations of compensating species that will yield concentrations of these species at the 
analyzer inlet that covers the range of concentrations expected during testing.  You may use 
binary or multi-gas span gases.  You may use a gas blending or mixing device to blend span 
gases.  A gas blending or mixing device is recommended when blending span gases diluted in N2 
with span gases diluted in air.  You may use a multi-gas span gas, such as NO-CO-CO2-C3H8-
CH4, to verify multiple analyzers at the same time. In designing your experimental setup, avoid 
pressure pulsations due to stopping the flow through the gas blending device.  If H2O correction 
is applicable, then span gases must be humidified before entering the analyzer; however, you 
may not humidify NO2 span gas by passing it through a sealed humidification vessel that 
contains water.  You must humidify NO2 span gas with another moist gas stream.  We 
recommend humidifying your NO-CO-CO2-C3H8-CH4, balance N2 blended gas by flowing the 
gas mixture through a sealed vessel that humidifies the gas by bubbling it through distilled water 
and then mixing the gas with dry NO2 gas, balance purified synthetic air.  If your system does 
not use a sample dryer to remove water from the sample gas, you must humidify your span gas to 
the highest sample H2O content that you estimate during emission sampling.  If your system uses 
a sample dryer during testing, it must pass the sample dryer verification check in §1065.342, and 
you must humidify your span gas to an H2O content greater than or equal to the level determined 
in §1065.145(e)(2).  If you are humidifying span gases without NO2, use good engineering 
judgment to ensure that the wall temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the 
humidifying system to the probe are above the dewpoint required for the target H2O content.  If 
you are humidifying span gases with NO2, use good engineering judgment to ensure that there is 
no condensation in the transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the point where humidified gas is 
mixed with NO2 span gas to the probe.  We recommend that you design your setup so that the 
wall temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the humidifying system to the 
probe are at least 5 ºC above the local sample gas dewpoint.  Operate the measurement and 
sample handling system as you do for emission testing.  Make no modifications to the sample 
handling system to reduce the risk of condensation.  Flow humidified gas through the sampling 
system before this check to allow stabilization of the measurement system’s sampling handling 
system to occur, as it would for an emission test.

(a) Scope and frequency.  If you use a sample dryer as allowed in §1065.145(e)(2) to remove 
water from the sample gas, verify the performance upon installation, after major maintenance, 
for thermal chiller.  For osmotic membrane dryers, verify the performance upon installation, after 
major maintenance, and within 35 days of testing. 
* * * * * 
(c) System requirements.  The sample dryer must meet the specifications as determined in 
§1065.145(e)(2) for dewpoint, Tdew, and absolute pressure, ptotal, downstream of the osmotic-
membrane dryer or thermal chiller. 
(d) * * * 
(4) Maintain the sample lines, fittings, and valves from the location where the humidified gas 
water content is measured to the inlet of the sampling system at a temperature at least 5 ºC above 
the local humidified gas dewpoint.  For dryers used in NOx sample systems, verify the sample 
system components used in this verification prevent aqueous condensation as required in 
§1065.145(d)(1)(i).  We recommend that the sample system components be maintained at least 5 
ºC above the local humidified gas dewpoint to prevent aqueous condensation. 
* * * * * 
(7) The sample dryer meets the verification if the dewpoint at the sample dryer pressure as 
measured in paragraph (d)(6) of this section is less than the dewpoint corresponding to the 
sample dryer specifications as determined in §1065.145(e)(2) plus 2 °C or if the mole fraction of 
water as measured in (d)(6) is less than the corresponding sample dryer specifications plus 0.002 
mol/mol.

164.  Section 1065.350 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: 
§1065.350 H2O interference verification for CO2 NDIR analyzers. 
* * * * * 
(d) Procedure.  Perform the interference verification as follows: 
(1) Start, operate, zero, and span the CO2 NDIR analyzer as you would before an emission test.  
If the sample is passed through a dryer during emission testing, you may run this verification test 
with the dryer if it meets the requirements of §1065.342.  Operate the dryer at the same 
conditions as you will for an emission test.  You may also run this verification test without the 
sample dryer. 
(2) Create a humidified test gas by bubbling zero gas that meets the specifications in §1065.750 
through distilled water in a sealed vessel.  If the sample is not passed through a dryer during 
emission testing, control the vessel temperature to generate an H2O level at least as high as the 
maximum expected during emission testing.  If the sample is passed through a dryer during 
emission testing, control the vessel temperature to generate an H2O level at least as high as the 
level determined in §1065.145(e)(2) for that dryer. 
 323
(3) Introduce the humidified test gas into the sample system.  You may introduce it downstream 
of any sample dryer, if one is used during testing. 
(4) If the sample is not passed through a dryer during this verification test, measure the water 
mole fraction, xH2O, of the humidified test gas, as close as possible to the inlet of the analyzer.  
For example, measure dewpoint, Tdew, and absolute pressure, ptotal, to calculate xH2O.  Verify that 
the water content meets the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  If the sample is 
passed through a dryer during this verification test, you must verify that the water content of the 
humidified test gas downstream of the vessel meets the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section based on either direct measurement of the water content (e.g., dewpoint and pressure) or 
an estimate based on the vessel pressure and temperature.  Use good engineering judgment to 
estimate the water content.  For example, you may use previous direct measurements of water 
content to verify the vessel’s level of saturation. 
(5) If a sample dryer is not used in this verification test, use good engineering judgment to 
prevent condensation in the transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the point where xH2O is 
measured to the analyzer.  We recommend that you design your system so the wall temperatures 
in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the point where xH2O is measured to the analyzer 
are at least 5 ºC above the local sample gas dewpoint. 
* * * * * 
 
165.  Section 1065.355 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: 
§1065.355 H2O and CO2 interference verification for CO NDIR analyzers. 
* * * * * 
(d) Procedure.  Perform the interference verification as follows: 
(1) Start, operate, zero, and span the CO NDIR analyzer as you would before an emission test.  If 
the sample is passed through a dryer during emission testing, you may run this verification test 
with the dryer if it meets the requirements of §1065.342.  Operate the dryer at the same 
conditions as you will for an emission test.  You may also run this verification test without the 
sample dryer. 
(2) Create a humidified CO2 test gas by bubbling a CO2 span gas that meets the specifications in 
§1065.750 through distilled water in a sealed vessel.  If the sample is not passed through a dryer 
during emission testing, control the vessel temperature to generate an H2O level at least as high 
as the maximum expected during emission testing.  If the sample is passed through a dryer 
during emisison testing, control the vessel temperature to generate an H2O level at least as high 
as the level determined in §1065.145(e)(2) for that dryer.  Use a CO2 span gas concentration at 
least as high as the maximum expected during testing. 
(3) Introduce the humidified CO2 test gas into the sample system.  You may introduce it 
downstream of any sample dryer, if one is used during testing.  
(4) If the sample is not passed through a dryer during this verification test, measure the water 
mole fraction, xH2O, of the humidified CO2 test gas as close as possible to the inlet of the 
analyzer.  For example, measure dewpoint, Tdew, and absolute pressure, ptotal, to calculate xH2O.  
Verify that the water content meets the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.  If the 
sample is passed through a dryer during this verification test, you must verify that the water 
content of the humidified test gas downstream of the vessel meets the requirement in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section based on either direct measurement of the water content (e.g., dewpoint and 
pressure) or an estimate based on the vessel pressure and temperature.  Use good engineering 
 324
judgment to estimate the water content.  For example, you may use previous direct 
measurements of water content to verify the vessel’s level of saturation. 
(5) If a sample dryer is not used in this verification test, use good engineering judgment to 
prevent condensation in the transfer lines, fittings, or valves from the point where xH2O is 
measured to the analyzer.  We recommend that you design your system so that the wall 
temperatures in the transfer lines, fittings, and valves from the point where xH2O is measured to 
the analyzer are at least 5 ºC above the local sample gas dewpoint.

166.  Section 1065.370 is amended by revising paragraph (e)(5) to read as follows: 
§1065.370 CLD CO2 and H2O quench verification. 
* * * * * 
(e) * * * 
(5) Humidify the NO span gas by bubbling it through distilled water in a sealed vessel.  If the 
humidified NO span gas sample does not pass through a sample dryer for this verification test, 
control the vessel temperature to generate an H2O level approximately equal to the maximum 
mole fraction of H2O expected during emission testing.  If the humidified NO span gas sample 
does not pass through a sample dryer, the quench verification calculations in §1065.675 scale the 
measured H2O quench to the highest mole fraction of H2O expected during emission testing.  If 
the humidified NO span gas sample passes through a dryer for this verification test, control the 
vessel temperature to generate an H2O level at least as high as the level determined in 
§1065.145(e)(2).  For this case, the quench verification calculations in §1065.675 do not scale 
the measured H2O quench.

167.  Section 1065.501 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) to

§1065.501 Overview. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(2) * * * 
(i) Discrete-mode cycles. Before emission sampling, stabilize an engine at the first discrete 
mode.  Sample emissions and other parameters for that mode in the same manner as a transient 
cycle, with the exception that reference speed and torque values are constant.  Record mean 
values for that mode, and then stabilize the engine at the next mode.  Continue to sample each 
mode discretely as separate test intervals and calculate weighted emission results according to 
the standard-setting part. 
(ii) Ramped-modal cycles.  Perform ramped-modal cycles similar to the way you would perform 
transient cycles, except that ramped-modal cycles involve mostly steady-state engine operation.  
Generate a ramped-modal duty cycle as a sequence of second-by-second (1 Hz) reference speed 
and torque points.  Run the ramped-modal duty cycle in the same manner as a transient cycle and 
use the 1 Hz reference speed and torque values to validate the cycle, even for cycles with % 
power.  Proportionally sample emissions and other parameters during the cycle and use the 
calculations in subpart G of this part to calculate emissions.  
* * * * * 
 
168.  Section 1065.510 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(5) to read as follows: 
§1065.510 Engine mapping. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(5) Perform one of the following: 
(i) For any engine subject only to steady-state duty cycles (i.e., discrete-mode or ramped-modal), 
you may perform an engine map by using discrete speeds.  Select at least 20 evenly spaced 
setpoints between warm idle speed and the endpoint. At each setpoint, stabilize speed and allow 
torque to stabilize. Record the mean speed and torque at each setpoint.  We recommend that you 
stabilize an engine for at least 15 seconds at each setpoint and record the mean feedback speed 
and torque of the last (4 to 6) seconds.  Use linear interpolation to determine intermediate speeds 
and torques.  Use this series of speeds and torques to generate the power map as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section. 
(ii) For any variable-speed engine, you may perform an engine map by using a continuous sweep 
of speed by continuing to record the mean feedback speed and torque at 1 Hz or more frequently 
and increasing speed at a constant rate such that it takes (4 to 6) min to sweep from 95 % of 
warm idle speed to the endpoint.  Stop recording after you complete the sweep.  From the series 
of mean speed and maximum torque values, use linear interpolation to determine intermediate 
values.  Use this series of speeds and torques to generate the power map as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section. 
(iii) Determine the endpoint of the map using one of the following methods: 
(A) You may use as your endpoint the highest speed above maximum power at which (50±5) % 
of maximum power occurs. 
 326
(B) You may use as your endpoint any speed higher than that specified in paragraph 
(b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section.  If you determine your endpoint for a continuous sweep according 
to this paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B), you may base your compliance with the (4 to 6) min specification 
in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section on the time it takes you to reach the speed specified in 
paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section. 
(C) If the speed specified in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section is unsafe (e.g, for ungoverned 
engines), use good engineering judgment to map up to the maximum safe speed.  If the engine is 
equipped with a governor that prevents the engine from operating at the speeds specified in 
paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, you may use the highest achievable speed as the 
endpoint.  Note that under §1065.10(c)(1) we may allow you to disregard portions of the map 
when selecting maximum test speed if the specified procedure would result in a duty cycle that 
does not represent in-use operation.

172.  A new §1065.546 is added to subpart F to read as follows: 
§1065.546 Validation of minimum dilution ratio for PM batch sampling. 
Use continuous flows and/or tracer gas concentrations for transient and ramped modal cycles to 
validate the minimum dilution ratios for PM batch sampling as specified in §1065.140(e)(2) over 
the test interval.  You may use mode-average values instead of continuous measurements for 
discrete mode steady-state duty cycles.  Determine the minimum primary and minimum overall 
 327
dilution ratios using one of the following methods (you may use a different method for each 
stage of dilution): 
(a) Determine minimum dilution ratio based on molar flow data.  This involves determination of 
at least two of the following three quantities: raw exhaust flow (or previously diluted flow), 
dilution air flow, and dilute exhaust flow. You may determine the raw exhaust flow rate based on 
the measured intake air molar flow rate and the chemical balance terms in §1065.655.  You may 
alternatively estimate the molar raw exhaust flow rate based on intake air, fuel rate 
measurements, and fuel properties, consistent with good engineering judgment. 
(b) Determine minimum dilution ratio based on tracer gas (e.g., CO2) concentrations in the raw 
(or previously diluted) and dilute exhaust corrected for any removed water. 
(c) Use good engineering judgment to develop your own method of determining dilution ratios. 
 
173.  Section 1065.550 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 
§1065.550 Gas analyzer range validation, drift validation, and drift correction. 
* * * * * 
(b) Drift validation and drift correction.  Calculate two sets of brake-specific emission results for 
each test interval.  Calculate one set using the data before drift correction and calculate the other 
set after correcting all the data for drift according to §1065.672.  Use the two sets of brake-
specific emission results to validate the duty cycle for drift as follows: 
(1) The duty cycle is validated for drift if you satisfy one of the following criteria: 
(i) For each test interval of the duty cycle and for each regulated pollutant, the difference 
between the uncorrected and the corrected brake-specific emission values over the test interval is 
within ±4 % of the uncorrected value or applicable emission standard, whichever is greater. 
(ii) For the entire duty cycle and for each regulated pollutant, the difference between the 
uncorrected and corrected composite brake-specific emission values over the entire duty cycle is 
within ±4 % of the uncorrected value or the applicable emission standard, whichever is greater.  
Note that for purposes of drift validation using composite brake-specific emission values over 
the entire duty cycle, leave unaltered any negative emission results over a given test interval (i.e., 
do not set them to zero).  A third calculation of composite brake-specific emission values is 
required for final reporting.  This calculation uses drift-corrected mass (or mass rate) values from 
each test interval and sets any negative mass (or mass rate) values to zero before calculating the 
composite brake-specific emission values over the entire duty cycle. 
(2) For standards consisting of multiple emission mass measurements (such as NMHC+NOx or 
separate NO and NO2 measurements to comply with a NOx standard), the duty cycle shall be 
validated for drift if you satisfy one of the following: 
(i) For each test interval of the duty cycle and for each individual mass, the difference between 
the uncorrected and the corrected brake-specific emission values over the test interval is within 
±4 % of the uncorrected value; or 
(ii) For the entire duty cycle the difference between the combined (e.g. NMHC + NOx) 
uncorrected and combined (e.g. NMHC + NOx) corrected composite brake-specific emissions 
values over the entire duty cycle is within ±4 % of the uncorrected value or the applicable 
emissions standard, whichever is greater.(3) If the test is not validated for drift, you may consider 
the test results for the duty cycle to be valid only if, using good engineering judgment, the 
observed drift does not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable 
emission standards.  For example, if the drift-corrected value is less than the standard by at least 
 328
two times the absolute difference between the uncorrected and corrected values, you may 
consider the data to be valid for demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard.

179.  Section 1065.650 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b), (c) introductory text, 
(d) introductory text, (d)(7), (e)(2), (f)(4), and (g) and adding paragraph (h) to read as 
follows: 
§1065.650 Emission calculations. 
(a) General.  Calculate brake-specific emissions over each applicable duty cycle or test interval.  
For test intervals with zero work (or power), calculate the emission mass (or mass rate), but not 
brake-specific emissions.  For duty cycles with multiple test intervals, refer to the standard-
setting part for calculations you need to determine a composite result, such as a calculation that 
weights and sums the results of individual test intervals in a duty cycle.  If the standard-setting 
part does not include those calculations, use the equations in paragraph (g) of this section.  This 
section is written based on rectangular integration, where each indexed value (i.e., “i”) represents 
(or approximates) the mean value of the parameter for its respective time interval, delta-t.  You 
may also integrate continuous signals using trapezoidal integration consistent with good 
engineering judgment. 
(b) Brake-specific emissions over a test interval.  We specify three alternative ways to calculate 
brake-specific emissions over a test interval, as follows: 
(1) For any testing, you may calculate the total mass of emissions, as described in paragraph (c) 
of this section, and divide it by the total work generated over the test interval, as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, using the following equation: 
me
W
=  
Eq. 1065.650-1 
Example: 
mNOx = 64.975 g 
W = 25.783 kW.hr 
eNOx = 64.975/25.783 
eNOx = 2.520 g/(kW.hr) 
(2)  For discrete-mode steady-state testing, you may calculate the brake-specific emissions over a 
test interval using the ratio of emission mass rate to power, as described in paragraph (e) of this 
section, using the following equation: 
me
P
= & 
Eq. 1065.650-2 
(3) For field testing, you may calculate the ratio of total mass to total work, where these 
individual values are determined as described in paragraph (f) of this section.  You may also use 
this approach for laboratory testing, consistent with good engineering judgment.  Good 
 334
engineering judgment dictates that this method not be used if there are any work flow paths 
described in §1065.210 that cross the system boundary, other than the primary output shaft 
(crankshaft).  This is a special case in which you use a signal linearly proportional to raw exhaust 
molar flow rate to determine a value proportional to total emissions. You then use the same 
linearly proportional signal to determine total work using a chemical balance of fuel, intake air, 
and exhaust as described in §1065.655, plus information about your engine’s brake-specific fuel 
consumption.  Under this method, flow meters need not meet accuracy specifications, but they 
must meet the applicable linearity and repeatability specifications in subpart D or subpart J of 
this part.  The result is a brake-specific emission value calculated as follows: 
me
W
= %% 
Eq. 1065.650-3 
Example: 
= 805.5 g 
= 52.102 kW.hr 
eCO = 805.5/52.102 
eCO = 2.520 g/(kW.hr) 
(c) Total mass of emissions over a test interval. To calculate the total mass of an emission, 
multiply a concentration by its respective flow.  For all systems, make preliminary calculations 
as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then use  the method in paragraphs (c)(2) through 
(4) of this section that is appropriate for your system.  Calculate the total mass of emissions as 
follows: 
* * * * * 
(d) Total work over a test interval.  To calculate the total work from the engine over a test 
interval, add the total work from all the work paths described in §1065.210 that cross the system 
boundary including electrical energy/work, mechanical shaft work, and fluid pumping work.  For 
all work paths, except the engine’s primary output shaft (crankshaft), the total work for the path 
over the test interval is the integration of the net work flow rate (power) out of the system 
boundary.  When energy/work flows into the system boundary, this work flow rate signal 
becomes negative; in this case, include these negative work rate values in the integration to 
calculate total work from that work path.  Some work paths may result in a negative total work.  
Include negative total work values from any work path in the calculated total work from the 
engine rather than setting the values to zero.  The rest of this paragraph (d) describes how to 
calculate total work from the engine’s primary output shaft over a test interval.  Before 
integrating power on the engine’s primary output shaft, adjust the speed and torque data for the 
time alignment used in §1065.514(c).  Any advance or delay used on the feedback signals for 
cycle validation must also be used for calculating work.  Account for work of accessories 
according to §1065.110.  Exclude any work during cranking and starting.  Exclude work during 
actual motoring operation (negative feedback torques), unless the engine was connected to one or 
more energy storage devices.  Examples of such energy storage devices include hybrid 
powertrain batteries and hydraulic accumulators, like the ones illustrated in Figure 1 of 
§1065.210.  Exclude any work during reference zero-load idle periods (0% speed or idle speed 
with 0 N.m reference torque).  Note, that there must be two consecutive reference zero load idle 
points to establish a period where this applies.  Include work during idle points with simulated 
minimum torque such as Curb Idle Transmissions Torque (CITT) for automatic transmissions in 
“drive”.  The work calculation method described in paragraphs (b)(1) though (7) of this section 
meets these requirements using rectangular integration.  You may use other logic that gives

equivalent results.  For example, you may use a trapezoidal integration method as described in 
paragraph (b)(8) of this section.

(2) To calculate an engine’s mean steady-state total power, P , add the mean steady-state power 
from all the work paths described in §1065.210 that cross the system boundary including 
electrical power, mechanical shaft power, and fluid pumping power.  For all work paths, except 
the engine’s primary output shaft (crankshaft), the mean steady-state power over the test interval 
is the integration of the net work flow rate (power) out of the system boundary divided by the 
period of the test interval.  When power flows into the system boundary, the power/work flow 
rate signal becomes negative; in this case, include these negative power/work rate values in the 
integration to calculate the mean power from that work path.  Some work paths may result in a 
negative mean power.  Include negative mean power values from any work path in the mean 
total power from the engine rather than setting these values to zero.  The rest of this paragraph 
(e)(2) describes how to calculate the mean power from the engine’s primary output shaft.  
 336
Calculate  using Equation 1065.650-13, noting that P , nf  and T  refer to mean power, mean 
rotational shaft frequency, and mean torque from the primary output shaft.  Account for the 
power of simulated accessories according to §1065.110 (reducing the mean primary output shaft 
power or torque by the accessory power or torque).  Set the power to zero during actual motoring 
operation (negative feedback torques), unless the engine was connected to one or more energy 
storage devices.  Examples of such energy storage devices include hybrid powertrain batteries 
and hydraulic accumulators, like the ones illustrated in Figure 1 of §1065.210.  Set the power to 
zero for modes with a zero reference load (0 N⋅m reference torque or 0 kW reference power).  
Include power during idle modes with simulated minimum torque or power.

(g) Brake-specific emissions over a duty cycle with multiple test intervals.  The standard-setting 
part may specify a duty cycle with multiple test intervals, such as with discrete-mode steady-
state testing.  Unless we specify otherwise, calculate composite brake-specific emissions over the 
duty cycle as described in this paragraph (g).  If a measured mass (or mass rate) is negative, set it 
to zero for calculating composite brake-specific emissions, but leave it unchanged for drift 
validation.  In the case of calculating composite brake-specific emissions relative to a combined 
emission standard (such as a NOx + NMHC standard), change any negative mass (or mass rate) 
values to zero for a particular pollutant before combining the values for the different pollutants.

(c)(4), (c)(5), and (d) to read as follows: 
§1065.655 Chemical balances of fuel, intake air, and exhaust. 
* * * * *  
(c) Chemical balance procedure.  The calculations for a chemical balance involve a system of 
equations that require iteration.  We recommend using a computer to solve this system of 
equations.  You must guess the initial values of up to three quantities: the amount of water in the 
measured flow, xH2Oexh, fraction of dilution air in diluted exhaust, xdil/exh, and the amount of 
products on a C1 basis per dry mole of dry measured flow, xCcombdry.  You may use time-weighted 
mean values of combustion air humidity and dilution air humidity in the chemical balance; as 
long as your combustion air and dilution air humidities remain within tolerances of ±0.0025 
mol/mol of their respective mean values over the test interval.  For each emission concentration, 
x,  and amount of water, xH2Oexh, you must determine their completely dry concentrations, xdry 
and xH2Oexhdry. You must also use your fuel’s atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio, α, oxygen-to-
carbon ratio, β, sulfur-to-carbon ratio, γ, and nitrogen-to-carbon ratio, δ.   You may measure α, 
 339
β, γ, and δ or you may use default values for a given fuel as described in §1065.655(d).  Use the 
following steps to complete a chemical balance: 
* * * * * 
(3) Use the following symbols and subscripts in the equations for this paragraph (c): 
xdil/exh = amount of dilution gas or excess air per mole of exhaust. 
xH2Oexh = amount of water in exhaust per mole of exhaust. 
xCcombdry = amount of carbon from fuel in the exhaust per mole of dry exhaust. 
xH2dry = amount of H2 in exhaust per amount of dry exhaust. 
KH2Ogas = water-gas reaction equilibrium coefficient.  You may use 3.5 or calculate your own value using good engineering 
judgment. 
xH2Oexhdry = amount of water in exhaust per dry mole of dry exhaust. 
xprod/intdry = amount of dry stoichiometric products per dry mole of intake air. 
xdil/exhdry = amount of dilution gas and/or excess air per mole of dry exhaust. 
xint/exhdry = amount of intake air required to produce actual combustion products per mole of dry (raw or diluted) exhaust. 
xraw/exhdry = amount of undiluted exhaust, without excess air, per mole of dry (raw or diluted) exhaust. 
xO2int = amount of intake air O2 per mole of intake air. 
xCO2intdry = amount of intake air CO2 per mole of dry intake air. You may use xCO2intdry = 375 µmol/mol, but we recommend 
measuring the actual concentration in the intake air. 
xH2Ointdry = amount of intake air H2O per mole of dry intake air. 
xCO2int = amount of intake air CO2 per mole of intake air. 
xCO2dil = amount of dilution gas CO2 per mole of dilution gas. 
xCO2dildry = amount of dilution gas CO2 per mole of dry dilution gas. If you use air as diluent, you may use xCO2dildry = 375 
µmol/mol, but we recommend measuring the actual concentration in the intake air. 
xH2Odildry = amount of dilution gas H2O per mole of dry dilution gas. 
xH2Odil = amount of dilution gas H2O per mole of dilution gas. 
x[emission]meas = amount of measured emission in the sample at the respective gas analyzer. 
x[emission]dry = amount of emission per dry mole of dry sample. 
xH2O[emission]meas = amount of water in sample at emission-detection location.  Measure or estimate these values according to 
§1065.145(e)(2). 
xH2Oint = amount of water in the intake air, based on a humidity measurement of intake air. α = atomic hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the mixture of fuel(s) being combusted, weighted by molar consumption. 
β = atomic oxygen-to-carbon ratio of the mixture of fuel(s) being combusted, weighted by molar consumption. 
γ = atomic sulfur-to-carbon ratio of the mixture of fuel(s) being combusted, weighted by molar consumption. 
δ = atomic nitrogen-to-carbon ratio of the mixture of fuel(s) being combusted, weighted by molar consumption.

181.  Section 1065.670 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) and adding 
paragraph (c) to read as follows: 
§1065.670 NOx intake-air humidity and temperature corrections. 
* * * * * 
(a) For compression-ignition engines, correct for intake-air humidity using the following 
equation: 
xNOxcor = xNOxuncor . (9.953 . xH2O + 0.832) 
Eq. 1065.670-1 
Example: 
xNOxuncor = 700.5 µmol/mol 
xH2O = 0.022 mol/mol 
xNOxcor = 700.5 . (9.953 . 0.022 + 0.832) 
xNOxcor = 736.2 µmol/mol 
(b) For spark-ignition engines, correct for intake-air humidity using the following equation: 
xNOxcor = xNOxuncor . (18.840 . xH2O + 0.68094) 
Eq. 1065.670-2 
Example: 
xNOxuncor = 154.7 µmol/mol 
xH2O = 0.022 mol/mol 
xNOxcor = 154.7 . (18.840 . 0.022 + 0.68094)

follows: 
§1065.690 Buoyancy correction for PM sample media.

(c) Air density.  Because a PM balance environment must be tightly controlled to an ambient 
temperature of (22 +1) °C and humidity has an insignificant effect on buoyancy correction, air 
density is primarily a function of atmospheric pressure.  We therefore specify a buoyancy 
correction that is only a function of atmospheric pressure.  Using good engineering judgment, 
you may develop and use your own buoyancy correction that includes the effects of temperature 
and dewpoint on density in addition to the effect of atmospheric pressure.

Subpart K— [Revised] 
 
185.  Section 1065.1001 is amended by revising the definitions for “Duty cycle” and 
“Percent” to read as follows: 
§1065.1001 Definitions. 
* * * * * 
 Duty cycle means one of the following: 
(1) A series of speed and torque values (or power values) that an engine must follow during a 
laboratory test.  Duty cycles are specified in the standard-setting part.  A single duty cycle may 
consist of one or more test intervals.  A series of speed and torque values meeting the definition 
of this paragraph (1) may also be considered a test cycle.  For example, a duty cycle may be a 
ramped-modal cycle, which has one test interval; a cold-start plus hot-start transient cycle, which 
has two test intervals; or a discrete-mode cycle, which has one test interval for each mode. 
(2) A set of weighting factors and the corresponding speed and torque values, where the 
weighting factors are used to combine the results of multiple test intervals into a composite 
result.* * * * * 
 Percent (%) means a representation of exactly 0.01 (with infinite precision).  Significant 
digits for the product of % and another value, or the expression of any other value as a 
percentage, are defined as follows: 
(1) Where we specify some percentage of a total value, the calculated value has the same number 
of significant digits as the total value.  The specified percentage by which the total value is 
multiplied has infinite precision.  Note that not all displayed or recorded digits are significant.  
For example, 2 % of a span value where the span value is 101.3302 is 2.026604.  However, 
where the span value has limited precision such that only one digit to the right of the decimal is 
significant (i.e., the actual value is 101.3), 2 % of the span value is 2.026. 
(2) In other cases, determine the number of significant digits using the same method as you 
would use for determining the number of significant digits of any calculated value.  For example, 
a calculated value of 0.321, where all three digits are significant, is equivalent to 32.1 %.

Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. 
 
Subpart A—[Amended] 
 
189.  Section 1068.25 is amended by adding paragraph (c) to read as follows: 
§1068.25  What information must I give to EPA? 
* * * * * 
(c) You are responsible for statements and information in your applications for certification or 
any other requests or reports.  If you provide statements or information to someone for 
submission to EPA, you are responsible for these statements and information as if you had 
submitted them to EPA yourself.  For example, knowingly submitting false information to 
someone else for inclusion in an application for certification would be deemed to be a 
submission of false information to the U.S. government in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001. 
 
190.  Section 1068.30 is amended by revising the introductory text for the definition of 
“Engine”, revising the definition of “Ultimate purchaser”, and adding a definition of “Gas 
turbine engine in alphabetical order to read as follows: 
§1068.30  What definitions apply to this part? 
* * * * * 
 Engine means an engine block with an installed crankshaft, or a gas turbine engine. The 
term engine does not include engine blocks without an installed crankshaft, nor does it include 
any assembly of reciprocating engine components that does not include the engine block. (Note: 
For purposes of this definition, any component that is the primary means of converting an 
engine's energy into usable work is considered a crankshaft, whether or not it is known 
commercially as a crankshaft.) This includes complete and partially complete engines as follows: 
* * * * * 
 Gas turbine engine means anything commercially known as a gas turbine engine or any 
collection of assembled engine components that is substantially similar to engines commercially 
known as  gas turbine engines.  For example, a jet engine is a gas turbine engine.  Gas turbine 
engines may be complete or partially complete.  Turbines that rely on external combustion such 
as steam engines are not gas turbine engines. 
* * * * * 
 Ultimate purchaser means the first person who in good faith purchases a new 
nonroadengine or new piece of equipment for purposes other than resale. 
* * * * * 
 
191.  Section 1068.31 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: 
§1068.31  What provisions apply to nonroad or stationary engines that change their status? 
* * * * * 
(d) Changing the status of a nonroad engine to be a new stationary engine as described in 
 350
paragraph (e) of this section is a violation of §1068.101(a)(1) unless the engine complies with all 
the requirements of this chapter for new stationary engines of the same type (for example, a 
compression-ignition engine rated at 40 kW) and model year.  For a new stationary engine that is 
required to be certified under 40 CFR part 60, the engine must have been certified to be 
compliant with all the requirements that apply to new stationary engines of the same type and 
model year, and must be in its certified configuration.  Note that the definitions of “model year” 
in the standard-setting part generally identifies the engine’s original date of manufacture as the 
basis for determining which standards apply if it becomes a stationary engine after it is no longer 
new.  For example, see 40 CFR 60.4219 and 60.4248. 
* * * * * 
 
192.  Section 1068.45 is amended by revising paragraph (c) introductory text to read as 
follows: 
§1068.45  General  labeling provisions. 
* * * * * 
(c) Labels on packaging. This part or the standard-setting part may in certain cases allow you to 
label the packaging if you ship engines/equipment packaged together instead of applying a 
removable label to engines/equipment individually.  Unless we specify otherwise, where we 
require engine/equipment labels that may be removable, you may instead label the packaging if 
the engines/equipment are packaged together as described in this paragraph (c). For example, 
this may involve packaging engines together by attaching them to a rack, binding them together 
on a pallet, or enclosing them in a box.  The provisions of this paragraph (c) also apply for 
engines/equipment boxed individually where you do not apply labels directly to the 
engines/equipment.  The following provisions apply if you label the packaging instead of 
labeling engines/equipment individually: 
* * * * * 
 
193.  Section 1068.101 is revised to read as follows: 
§1068.101  What general actions does this regulation prohibit? 
This section specifies actions that are prohibited and the maximum civil penalties that we can 
assess for each violation in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7522 and 7524.  The maximum penalty 
values listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are shown for calendar yearapply as of 
January 12, 20049.  As described in paragraph (e)(h) of this section, these maximum penalty 
limits for later yearsare different for earlier violations and they may be adjusted as are set forth in 
40 CFR part 19.  
(a) The following prohibitions and requirements apply to manufacturers of new engines, 
manufacturers of equipment containing these engines, and manufacturers of new equipment, 
except as described in subparts C and D of this part: 
(1)  Introduction into commerce. You may not sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver into 
commerce in the United States or import into the United States any new engine/equipment 
after emission standards take effect for the engine/equipment, unless it is covered by a valid 
certificate of conformity for its model year and has the required label or tag. You also may 
not take any of the actions listed in the previous sentence with respect to any equipment 
containing an engine subject to this part’s provisions unless the engine is covered by a valid 
certificate of conformity for its model year and has the required engine label or tag.  We may 
assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 for each engine or piece of equipment in violation. 
 351
(i) For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), a valid certificate of conformity is one that 
applies for the same model year as the model year of the equipment (except as allowed by 
§1068.105(a)), covers the appropriate category of engines/equipment (such as locomotive 
or Marine SI), and conforms to all requirements specified for equipment in the standard-
setting part.  Engines/equipment are considered not covered by a certificate unless they 
are in a configuration described in the application for certification. 
(ii) The requirements of this paragraph (a)(1) also cover new engines you produce to 
replace an older engine in a piece of equipment, unless the engine qualifies for the 
replacement-engine exemption in §1068.240.  
(iii) For engines used in equipment subject to equipment-based standards, you may not 
sell, offer for sale, or introduce or deliver into commerce in the United States or import 
into the United States any new engine unless it is covered by a valid certificate of 
conformity for its model year and has the required label or tag.  See the standard-setting 
part for more information about how this prohibition applies. 
(2) Reporting and recordkeeping. This chapter requires you to record certain types of 
information to show that you meet our standards.  You must comply with these requirements 
to make and maintain required records (including those described in §1068.501).  You may 
not deny us access to your records or the ability to copy your records if we have the authority 
to see or copy them.  Also, you must give us complete and accurate reports and information 
without delay as required under this chapter.  Failure to comply with the requirements of this 
paragraph is prohibited.  We may assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 for each day you are 
in violation.  In addition, knowingly submitting false information is a violation of 18 U.S.C. 
1001, which may involve criminal penalties and up to five years imprisonment. 
(3) Testing and access to facilities. You may not keep us from entering your facility to test 
engines/equipment or inspect if we are authorized to do so.  Also, you must perform the tests 
we require (or have the tests done for you).  Failure to perform this testing is prohibited. We 
may assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 for each day you are in violation. 
(b) The following prohibitions apply to everyone with respect to the engines and equipment to 
which this part applies: 
(1) Tampering. You may not remove or render inoperative any device or element of design 
installed on or in engines/equipment in compliance with the regulations prior to its sale and 
delivery to the ultimate purchaser.  You also may not knowingly remove or render 
inoperative any such device or element of design after such sale and delivery to the ultimate 
purchaser.  This includes, for example, operating an engine without a supply of appropriate 
quality urea if the emissions control system relies on urea to reduce NOx emissions or the use 
of incorrect fuel or engine oil that renders the emissions control system inoperative.  Section 
1068.120 describes how this applies to rebuilding engines.  See the standard-setting part, 
which may include additional provisions regarding actions prohibited by this requirement.  
For a manufacturer or dealer, we may assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 for each engine or 
piece of equipment in violation.  For anyone else, we may assess a civil penalty up to 
$23,750 for each day an engine or piece of equipment is operated in violation.  This 
prohibition does not apply in any of the following situations: 
(i) You need to repair the engine/equipment and you restore it to proper functioning when 
the repair is complete. 
(ii) You need to modify the engine/equipment to respond to a temporary emergency and 
you restore it to proper functioning as soon as possible. 
 352
(iii) You modify new engines/equipment that another manufacturer has already certified 
to meet emission standards and recertify them under your own family.  In this case you 
must tell the original manufacturer not to include the modified engines/equipment in the 
original family.   
(2) Defeat devices. You may not knowingly manufacture, sell, offer to sell, or install, any 
part that bypasses, impairs, defeats, or disables the control of emissions of any regulated 
pollutant, except as explicitly allowed by the standard-setting part.  We may assess a civil 
penalty up to $23,750 for each part in violation. 
(3) Stationary engines. For an engine that is excluded from any requirements of this chapter 
because it is a stationary engine, you may not move it or install it in any mobile equipment 
except as allowed by the provisions of this chapter.  You may not circumvent or attempt to 
circumvent the residence-time requirements of paragraph (2)(iii) of the nonroad engine 
definition in §1068.30.  Anyone violating this paragraph (b)(3) is deemed to be a 
manufacturer in violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  We may assess a civil penalty 
up to $327,500 for each day you are in violation. 
(4) Competition engines/equipment. For uncertified engines/equipment that are excluded or 
exempted from any requirements of this chapter because they are to be used solely for 
competition, you may not use any of them in a manner that is inconsistent with use solely for 
competition.  Anyone violating this paragraph (b)(4) is deemed to be a manufacturer in 
violation of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  We may assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 
for each day you are in violation.  
(5) Importation. You may not import an uncertified engine or piece of equipment if it is 
defined to be new in the standard-setting part with a model year for which emission standards 
applied.  Anyone violating this paragraph (b)(5) is deemed to be a manufacturer in violation 
of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  We may assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 for each 
day you are in violation.  Note the following: 
(i) The definition of new is broad for imported engines/equipment; uncertified engines 
and equipment (including used engines and equipment) are generally considered to be 
new when imported. 
(ii) Used engines/equipment that were originally manufactured before applicable EPA 
standards were in effect are generally not subject to emission standards.  
(6) Warranty, recall, and maintenance instructions. You must meet your obligation to honor 
your emission-related warranty under §1068.115, including any commitments you identify in 
your application for certification.  You must also fulfill all applicable requirements under 
subpart F of this part related to emission-related defects and recalls.  You must also provide 
emission-related installation and maintenance instructions as described in the standard-
setting part.  Failure to meet these obligations is prohibited. Also, except as specifically 
provided by regulation, you are prohibited from directly or indirectly communicating to the 
ultimate purchaser or a later purchaser that the emission-related warranty is valid only if the 
owner has service performed at authorized facilities or only if the owner uses authorized 
parts, components, or systems.  We may assess a civil penalty up to $327,500 for each engine 
or piece of equipment in violation. 
(7) Labeling. (i) You may not remove or alter an emission control information label or other 
required permanent label except as specified in this paragraph (b)(7) or otherwise allowed 
by this chapter.  Removing or altering an emission control information label is a violation 
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.  However, it is not a violation to remove a label in the 
 353
following circumstances: 
(A) The engine is destroyed, is permanently disassembled, or otherwise loses its 
identity such that the original title to the engine is no longer valid.  
(B) The regulations specifically direct you to remove the label.  For example, see 
§1068.235. 
(C) The part on which the label is mounted needs to be replaced.  In this case, you 
must have a replacement part with a duplicate of the original label installed by the 
certifying manufacturer or an authorized agent, except that the replacement label may 
omit the date of manufacture if applicable.  We generally require labels to be 
permanently attached to parts that will not normally be replaced, but this provision 
allows for replacements in unusual circumstances, such as damage in a collision or 
other accident. 
(D) The original label is incorrect, provided that it is replaced with the correct label 
from the certifying manufacturer or an authorized agent.  This allowance to replace 
incorrect labels does not affect whether the application of an incorrect original label is 
a violation. 
(ii) Removing or altering a temporary or removable label contrary to the provisions of 
this paragraph (b)(7)(ii) is a violation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
(A) For labels identifying temporary exemptions, you may not remove or alter the 
label while the engine/equipment is in an exempt status.  The exemption is 
automatically revoked for each engine/equipment for which the label has been 
removed. 
(B) For temporary or removable consumer information labels, only the ultimate 
purchaser may remove the label. 
(iii) You may not apply a false emission control information label.  You also may not 
manufacture, sell, or offer to sell false labels. The application, manufacture, sale, or offer 
for sale of false labels is a violation of this section (such as paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(2) of 
this section).  Note that applying an otherwise valid emission control information label to 
the wrong engine is considered to be applying a false label. 
(c) If you cause someone to commit a prohibited act in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you 
are in violation of that prohibition. 
(d) Exemptions from these prohibitions are described in subparts C and D of this part and in the 
standard-setting part. 
(e) The standard-setting parts describe more requirements and prohibitions that apply to 
manufacturers (including importers) and others under this chapter. 
(f) The specification of prohibitions and penalties in this part does not limit the prohibitions and 
penalties described in the Clean Air Act.  Additionally, a single act may trigger multiple 
violations under this section and the Act.  We may pursue all available administrative, civil, or 
criminal remedies for those violations even if the regulation references only a single prohibited 
act in this section. 
(g) [Reserved] 
(h)  The maximum penalty values listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are shown for 
calendar yearapply as of January 12, 20049.  Maximum penalty values for earlier violations are 
published in 40 CFR part 19.  Maximum penalty limits for later years may be adjusted after 
January 12, 2009 based on the Consumer Price Index.  The specific regulatory provisions for 
changing the maximum penalties, published in 40 CFR part 19, reference the applicable U.S.

194.  Section 1068.103 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§1068.103 What are the provisions related to the duration and applicability of certificates 
of conformity? 
(a) Engines/equipment covered by a certificate of conformity are limited to those that are 
produced during the period specified in the certificate and conform to the specifications 
described in the certificate and the associated application for certification.  For the purposes of 
this paragraph (a), specifications includes any conditions or limitations identified by the 
manufacturer or EPA, but does not include any information provided in the application that is not 
relevant to a demonstration of compliance with applicable regulations.  For example, if the 
application for certification specifies certain engine models or production 
 355
facilitiesconfigurations, the certificate does not cover any modelsconfigurations that are not 
specified. and it does not cover engines/equipment produced at production facilities that are not 
specified. However, your certificate would not be conditioned upon your actual U.S.-directed 
production volumes matching the volumes you projected in your application. 
* * * * * 
 
195.  Section 1068.105 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows: 
§1068.105  What other provisions apply to me specifically if I manufacture equipment 
needing certified engines? 
* * * * * 
(a) Transitioning to new engine-based standards. If new engine-based emission standards apply 
in a given model year, your equipment in that calendar year must have engines that are certified 
to the new standards, except that you may continue to use up your normal inventory of earlier 
engines that were built before the date of the new or changed standards.  (Note: this paragraph 
(a) does not apply in the case of new remanufacturing standards.)  For example, if your normal 
inventory practice is to keep on hand a one-month supply of engines based on your upcoming 
production schedules, and a new tier of standards starts to apply for the 2015 model year, you 
may order engines consistent with your normal inventory requirements late in the engine 
manufacturer’s 2014 model year and install those engines in your equipment, regardless of the 
date of installation.  Also, if your model year starts before the end of the calendar year preceding 
new standards, you may use engines from the previous model year for those units you produce 
before January 1 of the year that new standards apply.  If emission standards for the engine do 
not change in a given model year, you may continue to install engines from the previous model 
year without restriction (or any earlier model year for which the same standards apply).  You 
may not circumvent the provisions of §1068.101(a)(1) by stockpiling engines that were built 
before new or changed standards take effect.  Note that this allowance does not apply for 
equipment subject to equipment-based standards.  See 40 CFR 1060.601 for similar provisions 
that apply for equipment subject to evaporative emission standards.  
* * * * * 
 
196.  Section 1068.120 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: 
§1068.120  What requirements must I follow to rebuild engines? 
* * * * * 
(e)  If the rebuilt engine remains installed or is reinstalled in the same piece of equipment, you 
must rebuild it to the original configuration or another, except as allowed by this paragraph (e).  
You may rebuild it to a different certified configuration of the same or later model year.  You 
may also rebuild it to a certified configuration from an earlier model year as long as the earlier 
configuration is as clean or cleaner than the original configuration.  For purposes of this 
paragraph (e), “as clean or cleaner” means one of the following: 
(1) For engines not certified with a Family Emission Limit for calculating credits for a 
particular pollutant, this means that the same emission standard applied for both model years.  
This includes supplemental standards such as Not-to-Exceed standards. 
(2) For engines certified with a Family Emission Limit for a particular pollutant, this means 
that the configuration to which the engine is being rebuilt has a Family Emission Limit for 
that pollutant that is at or below the standard that applied to the engine originally, and is at or 
below the original Family Emission Limit.

(b) Administrative penalties.  Instead of bringing a civil action, we may assess administrative 
penalties if the total is less than $270,000 $295,000 against you individually.  This maximum 
penalty may be greater if the Administrator and the Attorney General jointly determine that a 
greater administrative penalty assessment is appropriate, or if the limit is adjusted under 40 CFR 
part 19.  No court may review this determination.  Before we assess an administrative penalty, 
you may ask for a hearing (subject to 40 CFR part 22).  The Administrator may compromise or 
remit, with or without conditions, any administrative penalty that may be imposed under this 
section.

Subpart C—[Amended] 
 
198.  Section 1068.215 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as 
follows: 
§1068.215  What are the provisions for exempting manufacturer-owned 
engines/equipment? 
(a)  You are eligible for the exemption for manufacturer-owned engines/equipment only if you 
are a certificate holder.  Any engine for which you meet all applicable requirements under this 
section is exempt without request. 
(b)  Engines/equipment may be exempt without a request if they are nonconforming 
engines/equipment under your ownership, possession, and control and you do not operate them 
for purposes other than to develop products, assess production methods, or promote your 
engines/equipment in the marketplace, or other purposes we approve.  You may not loan, lease, 
sell, or use the engine/equipment to generate revenue, either by itself or for an engine installed in 
a piece of equipment, except as allowed by §1068.201(i).  Note that this paragraph (b) does not 
prevent the sale or shipment of a partially complete engine to a secondary engine manufacturer 
that will meet the requirements of this paragraph (b).  See §1068.262 for provisions related to 
shipping partially complete engines to secondary engine manufacturers.   
* * * * * 
 
199.  Section 1068.240 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(6), (c) introductory text, 
(d), (e), and (g)(2) to read as follows: 
§1068.240  What are the provisions for exempting new replacement engines? 
* * * * * 
(b)* * * 
(6)You add a permanent label, consistent with §1068.45, with your corporate name and 
trademark and the following additional information: 
(i)  Add the following statement if the engine being replaced was not subject to any 
emission standards under this chapter: 
THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH U.S. EPA NONROADEMISSION 
 357
REQUIREMENTS.  SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY 
PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO REPLACE AN NONROADENGINE BUILT 
BEFORE JANUARY 1, [Insert appropriate year reflecting when the earliest tier of 
standards began to apply to engines of that size and type] MAY BE A VIOLATION 
OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY. 
(ii) Add the following statement if the engine being replaced was subject to emission 
standards: 
THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA NONROADEMISSION 
REQUIREMENTS FOR [Identify the appropriate emission standards (by model year, 
tier, or emission levels) for the replaced engine] ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 1068.240.  
SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN TO 
REPLACE A [Identify the appropriate emission standards for the replaced engine, by 
model year(s), tier(s), or emission levels)] ENGINE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF 
FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY. 
(c) Previous-tier replacement engines without tracking. You may produce a limited number of 
new replacement engines that are not from a currently certified engine family under the 
provisions of this paragraph (c).  If you produce new engines under this paragraph (c) to replace 
engines subject to emission standards, the new replacement engine must be in a configuration 
identical in all material respects to the old engine and meet the requirements of §1068.265.  This 
would apply, for example, for engine configurations that were certified in an earlier model year 
but are no longer covered by a certificate of conformity.  You must comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for any number of replacement engines you produce 
in excess of what we allow under this paragraph (c).  The following provisions apply to engines 
exempted under this paragraph (c): 
* * * * * 
(d) Current-tierPartially complete engines.  The following requirements apply if you ship a 
partially complete replacement engines for engine-based standards. You may introduce into U.S. 
commerce short blocks or otherengine under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section: 
(1) Include installation instructions specifying how to complete the engine assembly such 
that the resulting engine conforms to the applicable certificate of conformity or the 
specifications of §1068.265.  Where a partially complete engines from a currently certified 
engine family as replacement components for in-use equipment powered by engines you 
originally produced.  Youengine can be built into multiple different configurations, you must 
be able to identify all the engine models and model years for which the partially complete 
engine may properly be used for replacement purposes.  Your installation instructions must 
make clear how the final assembler can determine which configurations are appropriate for 
the engine they receive.  
(2) You must label the engine as follows: 
(1i) If you have a reasonable basis to believe that the fully assembled engine will include 
the original emission control information label, you may add a removable label to the 
engine with your corporate name and trademark and the statement: “This replacement 
engine is exempt under 40 CFR 1068.240(db) [or 40 CFR 1068.240(c) if appropriate].”  
This would generally apply if all the engine models that are compatible with the 
replacement engine were covered by a certificate of conformity and they were labeled in 
a position on the engine or equipment that is not included as part of the partially complete 
engine being shipped for replacement purposes.  Removable labels must meet the 
 358
requirements specified in §1068.45. 
(2ii) If you do not qualify for using a removable label in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
you must add a permanent label in a readily visible location, though it may be obscured 
after installation in a piece of equipment.  Include on the permanent label your corporate 
name and trademark, the engine’s part number (or other identifying information), and the 
statement: “This replacement engine is exempt under 40 CFR 1068.240(db) [or 40 CFR 
1068.240(c) if appropriate].”  If there is not enough space for this statement, you may 
alternatively add: “REPLACEMENT” or “SERVICE ENGINE”.   For purposes of this 
paragraph (d)(2), engine part numbers permanently stamped or engraved on the engine 
are considered to be included on the label. 
(e) Current-tierPartially complete current-tier replacement engines for. The provisions of 
paragraph (d) of this section apply for partially complete engines you produce from a current line 
of certified engines or vehicles, except that the appropriate regulatory cite on the label is 40 CFR 
1068.240(e).  This applies for engine-based and equipment-based standards. In the case of 
equipment subject to as follows: 
(1) Where engine-based standards apply, you may introduce into U.S. commerce short blocks 
or other partially complete engines from a currently certified engine family as replacement 
components for in-use equipment powered by engines you originally produced.  You must be 
able to identify all the engine models and model years for which the partially complete 
engine may properly be used for replacement purposes.   
(2) Where equipment-based standards apply, you may introduce into U.S. commerce engines 
that are identical to engines covered by a current certificate of conformity by demonstrating 
compliance with currently applicable standards where the engines will be installed as 
replacement engines.  These engines might be fully assembled, but we would consider them 
to be partially complete engines because they are not yet installed in the equipment.  You 
must be able to identify all the engine and equipment models and model years for which such 
an engine may properly be used for replacement purposes.  Add a permanent or removable 
label to these engines as described in paragraph (d) of this section, except that the appropriate 
regulatory cite is 40 CFR 1068.240(e). 
* * * * * 
(g) * * * 
(2) Anyone installing or completing assembly of an exempted new replacement engine is 
deemed to be a manufacturer of a new engine with respect to the prohibitions of 
§1068.101(a)(1).  This applies to all engines exempted under this section.
