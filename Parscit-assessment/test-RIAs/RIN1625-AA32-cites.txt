One contributing factor to this scenario is that NIS have a higher survivability rate on hulls than in ballast tanks. Past analyses of ballast water and hull fouling indicate that the rate of shipping invasions due to ballast water could be as high as 63 percent (Mills, et al. 1993) and as low as 10 percent. The relative impact of ballast water and hull fouling vectors has not been fully understood (Ruiz 2002). In a recent analysis of historical invertebrate invasions, Fofonoff, et al. (2003) classified nonnative species (invertebrates, algae and fish) associated with shipping to assess the likelihood of invasion by the subvectors based on traits such as life history, etc. Table 5.5 summarized the results of the Fofonoff et al.

Based on the cumulative impacts of invasions, we have calculated a mid-range estimate of annual costs for all harmful ballast water-introduced invasions over the 10 year period of 2012 to 2021 at $2.016 billion at a 7 percent discount (Table ES-7).

In one study, an estimate of $5.7 billion is given for annual fish related costs (Pimentel 2005). This study defines cost in terms of losses to commercial and sports fishing in the Great Lakes and other U.S. inland waters. Two invasive species in particular are nearly always cited on this subject – the Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and the Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The Ruffe came from Europe via ballast water in the 1980’s and the Sea lamprey migrated naturally. Both species prey on other fish and compete for habitat. In two studies on these species, losses were quantified in terms of future angler days lost due to decreases in fishing population (Leigh 1998 and Lupi et al 2003).</context>

In addition, the distribution of costs by category differ from invasive specie to specie. A few studies have provided specie-specific information of costs or damages by category. For example, O’Neill 1997 surveyed infrastructure owners on their expenditures on zebra-mussel related activities. Only about 1.1 percent of the zebra mussel expenditures were related to recreation or tourism. The majority of the expenditures were related to water treatment plants and electric power generation facilities. Pimentel 2005 estimated that about 16 percent of economic impacts (damages and control costs) from mussels in the New York State Canal and Hudson River system were related to tourism or recreation. On the other hand, Pimentel 2005 estimates that 50 percent of the impacts from invasive fish species in this region are related to tourism or recreational activities such as sport fishing. Based on this limited information, some portion of the estimated benefits from preventing future invasions may represent transfers, but the amount will vary widely depending on the nature of the specie and extent of the invasi</context>

Fofonoff et al. 2003 also evaluated temporal changes in the shipping vectors and found that ballast water invasions appear to be growing at a faster rate over the past 30 years in comparison to hull fouling invasions, although there is considerable uncertainty due to the relatively large number of invasions that could not be definitively classified. Fraction of Invasions That Cause Harm Further, not all invasions will cause harm. According to Windle 1997: “On average, 15 percent of foreign species trigger severe economic or financial damage and about 40 percent cause some harm.” For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that 15 percent of the invasions will cause economic damage, a figure that is also in line with the findings of the OTA 1993 assessment. We note that we may be underestimating the number of harmful species by not including all or some fraction of the 40 percent of species that may cause some harm.

Longer retention times introduce the risk of voyage delays that can incur additional costs of tens of thousands of dollars per day based upon lost opportunity or demurrage fees. Approaches that occur at uptake, such as filtration or hydroclonic separation, may be appropriate for some NIS size ranges. These approaches would also be appropriate as a method to achieve near-zero discharge of NIS (Alternative 5). Filtration could be an effective approach (CSLC 2005), but recent trials (Wright and Mackey 2006) indicate that filtration is not necessarily completely effective. Early testing of hydroclonic separation, which eliminates particles (sediment or biota), shows some promise. Eliminating BWD achieves maximum reduction in introduction of NIS. Effectively zero discharge (Alternative 5) might be achieved by a combination of operational practices that virtually eliminate discharge and the use of treatment systems capable of BWD-4 or similar standards to be used in the case of emergency. These emergency uses could be regulated and would not require high capacity systems. For a further discussion o</context>

For example, human pathogen microorganisms are common in coastal waters and have been found in the ballast water of vessels (Ruiz et al. 2000b). During the 1997 and 1998 shipping seasons, samples were taken from the ballast tanks of 28 transoceanic vessels (Knight et al. 1999; Reynolds et al. 1999; Zo et al. 1999). The sampling revealed the presence of a host of microorganisms, many of which are human pathogens, including fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, clostridium, salmonella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, cryptosporidium, giardia, and enteroviruses. The presence of these organisms demonstrated the survival of human pathogens during transoceanic transport of ballast water. It has been shown that certain microbial organisms can survive and become successfully established following BWD, thereby becoming vectors for human exposure. The global increase in HAB via BWD poses an increased risk to human healt</context>

Thus, an invasion that occurs in the first year of our analysis (2012) will incur costs/damages in each of the next 10 years (through 2021). Based on the cumulative impacts of invasions, we have calculated a mid-range estimate of annual costs for all harmful ballast water-introduced invasions over the 10 year period of 2012 to 2021 at $2.016 billion at a 7 percent discount (Table ES-7).

In one study, an estimate of $5.7 billion is given for annual fish related costs (Pimentel 2005). This study defines cost in terms of losses to commercial and sports fishing in the Great Lakes and other U.S. inland waters. Two invasive species in particular are nearly always cited on this subject – the Ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) and the Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The Ruffe came from Europe via ballast water in the 1980’s and the Sea lamprey migrated naturally. Both species prey on other fish and compete for habitat. In two studies on these species, losses were quantified in terms of future angler days lost due to decreases in fishing population (Leigh 1998 and Lupi et al 2003).</context>

Thus, an invasion that occurs in the first year of our analysis (2012) will incur costs/damages in each of the next 10 years (through 2021). Based on the cumulative impacts of invasions, we have calculated a mid-range estimate of annual costs for all harmful BW-introduced invasions over the 10 year period of 2012 to 2021 at</context>
<context position="222582" citStr="Pimentel 2005" startWordPosition="33582" endWordPosition="33583">f costs per species simply do not provide sufficient detail to divide costs into the categories. In addition, the distribution of costs by category differ from invasive specie to specie. A few studies have provided specie-specific information of costs or damages by category. For example, O’Neill 1997 surveyed infrastructure owners on their expenditures on zebra-mussel related activities. Only about 1.1 percent of the zebra mussel expenditures were related to recreation or tourism. The majority of the expenditures were related to water treatment plants and electric power generation facilities. Pimentel 2005 estimated that about 16 percent of economic impacts (damages and control costs) from mussels in the New York State Canal and Hudson River system were related to tourism or recreation. On the other hand, Pimentel 2005 estimates that 50 percent of the impacts from invasive fish species in this region are related to tourism or recreational activities such as sport fishing. Based on this limited information, some portion of the estimated benefits from preventing future invasions may represent transfers, but the amount will vary widely depending on the nature of the specie and extent of the invasi</context>
