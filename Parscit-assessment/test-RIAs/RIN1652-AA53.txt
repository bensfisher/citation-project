 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
 
ECONOMIC IMPACTS 
Changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses.  First, 
Executive Order 12866 directs each Federal agency to propose or adopt a regulation only if the 
agency makes a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its 
costs.  Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic 
impact of regulatory changes on small entities.  Third, the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. § 
2531-2533) prohibits agencies from setting standards that create unnecessary obstacles to the 
foreign commerce of the United States.  In developing U.S. standards, this Trade Act requires 
agencies to consider international standards and where appropriate, as the basis of U.S. 
standards.  Fourth, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) requires 
agencies to prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits and other effects of proposed or 
final rules that include a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditure by State, local or 
tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more annually 
(adjusted for inflation). 
With respect to these analyses, TSA provides the following conclusions and summary 
information: 
(1) TSA has determined that this is an economically significant rule within the definition 
of Executive Order (EO) 12866, as estimated annual costs or benefits exceed $100 
million in any year.   
(2) As a normal practice, we provide the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) to 
the public but withhold the final conclusion as required by the RFA until after we 
7 
 receive public comments and publish the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(FRFA).  The IRFA reflects substantial gaps in data where TSA was unable to 
identify either impacted entities or revenues for those that are businesses.  TSA has 
provided the analysis based upon available data and requests public comment on all 
aspects of the analysis.  As a result, TSA makes no preliminary finding as to whether 
there is or is not a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. 
(3) The Trade Agreement Act of 1979 prohibits Federal agencies from establishing any 
standards or engaging in related activities that create unnecessary obstacles to the 
foreign commerce of the United States.  Legitimate domestic objectives, such as 
safety, are not considered unnecessary obstacles.  The statute also requires 
consideration of international standards and, where appropriate, that they be the basis 
for U.S. standards.  TSA has assessed the potential effect of this notice of proposed 
rulemaking and has determined this rule would not have an adverse impact on 
international trade. 
(4) The regulatory evaluation provides the required written analysis of Unfunded 
Mandates.  The proposed rule is likely to result in the expenditure by the private 
sector of over $100 million or in any one year (adjusted for inflation), and therefore 
meets the threshold of an Unfunded Mandate as defined by the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act (UMRA).

 Summary of the Proposed Rule 
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) proposes to amend current aviation 
transportation security regulations to enhance the security of general aviation by expanding the 
scope of current requirements and by adding new requirements for certain large aircraft operators 
and airports.  The main objectives of the proposed rule are to merge the Partial, Private Charter, 
and Twelve-Five Standard Security Programs into a Large Aircraft Standard Security Program 
(LASP); to apply this LASP to general aviation operators using aircraft with a maximum 
certificated takeoff weight (MTOW) over 12,500 pounds (“large aircraft”); and, to enhance the 
security of these operations.  The LASP would have a core component based largely on the 
current Twelve-Five Security Program which would apply to all operators using large aircraft, 
and two additional components which would incorporate requirements specific to the Private 
Charter and Twelve-Five All-Cargo Security Programs. 
A key component of the proposed rule is the application of matching of passenger 
information against the No Fly and Selectee portions of the consolidated terrorist watch list 
maintained by the Federal government (“watch list”).  In order to enable this matching and 
reduce the number of individuals who have access to the sensitive information on the watch list, 
the rule proposes a process whereby third parties may apply to TSA to become approved watch 
list service providers.  Aircraft operators would be required to submit passenger information to 
these service providers for comparison to the watch list.  If the watch list service provider were 
to subsequently determine that a passenger was a match to the No Fly portion of the list, the 
proposed rule would require the aircraft operator to prohibit that passenger from boarding the 
aircraft. 
10 
 In order to assure compliance with the LASP, the rule proposes a process whereby third 
parties may apply to TSA to become approved auditors of large aircraft security programs.  
Aircraft operators would be required to contract with these TSA-approved auditors in order to 
demonstrate their compliance with the requirements of the LASP and TSA regulations.  Auditors 
would review aircraft operators’ compliance with their security programs and TSA regulations 
and provide the results of their audit to the aircraft operator and to TSA.  Third parties may be 
both auditors and watch list service providers.  TSA would conduct inspections of aircraft 
operators based on a combination of audit findings and random sampling. 
Finally, the proposed rule would require a partial airport security program for airports 
designated by the Secretary of Transportation as “reliever airports” and non-federalized airports 
regularly serving scheduled or public charter operations in large aircraft.  A non-federalized 
airport is an airport that is not subject to TSA passenger screening requirements and therefore 
does not have TSA or contract personnel on site for the purpose of passenger screening. 
Benefits  
The proposed rule would yield benefits in the areas of security and quality governance.  
The security and governance benefits are four-fold.  First, the rule would enhance security by 
expanding the mandatory use of security measures to certain operators of large aircraft that are 
not currently required to have a security plan.  These measures would deter malicious individuals 
from perpetrating acts that might compromise transportation or national security by using large 
aircraft for these purposes.  Second, it would harmonize, as appropriate, security measures used 
by a single operator in its various operations and between different operators.  Third, the new 
periodic audits of security programs would augment TSA’s efforts to ensure that large aircraft 
operators are in compliance with their security programs.  Finally, it would consolidate the 
11 
 regulatory framework for large aircraft operators that currently operate under a variety of 
security programs, thus simplifying the regulations and allowing for better governance.  When 
taken together, the security-related benefits would act as part of the larger benefits yielded by the 
Transportation Security Administration’s layered security approach. 
At this time, TSA cannot quantify these benefits; however, TSA has included a rough 
“break-even” analysis which indicates the tradeoffs between program cost and program benefits 
(in the form of impact on baseline risk of a significant aviation-related terror attack) that would 
be required for the Large Aircraft Security Program to be a cost beneficial undertaking. 
Costs  
The following summarizes the estimated costs of this rulemaking by general category of 
who pays.  A summary table provides an overview of the cost items and a brief description of 
cost elements.  Both in this summary and the economic evaluation, descriptive language is used 
to try and relate the consequences of the regulation.  Although the regulatory evaluation attempts 
to mirror the terms and wording of the regulation, no attempt is made to precisely replicate the 
regulatory language and readers are cautioned that the actual regulatory text, not the text 
of the evaluation, is binding.  Throughout the evaluation rounding in displayed values may 
result in minor differences in displayed totals.  
Aircraft operators, airport operators, and the Transportation Security Administration 
would incur costs to comply with the requirements of the proposed Large Aircraft Security 
Program rule.  TSA estimated the total 10-year present value cost of the program would be $1.4 
billion, discounted at 7%.  Aircraft operator costs comprise 85% of all estimated expenses.  This 
is due to the large number of newly regulated aircraft operators and the anticipated time security 
coordinators would spend on their duties.   
12 
 TSA estimated that there are 9,835 aircraft operators that would be subject to this rule, 
and of these TSA estimated that 9,061 general aviation aircraft operators use aircraft with a 
maximum takeoff weight exceeding 12,500 pounds that are not required to operate under any 
existing TSA security programs and would thus  be subject to the proposed rule.  The remaining 
774 aircraft operators are currently subject to one or more existing TSA rule, and an important 
purpose and advantage of the current rule is to unify the coverage of a set of diverse rules.   The 
presentation of costs in this regulatory evaluation is organized to reflect the fact that some 
operators are currently subject to TSA security program requirements under existing rules 
(“existing operators”) and others will be newly covered by this rule (“new operators”).  .  Costs 
to these newly regulated aircraft operators represent 84% of total estimated costs, with security 
coordinator duties and training making up 90% of those new aircraft operator costs.  Security 
coordinator duties and training for these operators are estimated to cost $1.0 billion over 10 
years, discounted at 7%.  The following figure provides the total 10-year costs as well as 
annualized costs at the 0%, 7%, and 3% discount rates for the principal populations affected by 
the proposed rule. 
Figure 2: Total and Annualized Costs by Affected Entity (Millions of $) 
 10-Year Total Costs  Annualized Costs  
Affected Entity 0% 3% 7% 0% 3% 7% 
New Aircraft Operators $1,655.8 $1,402.3 $1,143.5 $165.6 $164.4 $162.8
Existing Aircraft Operators $19.6 $16.7 $13.6 $2.0 $2.0 $1.9
Airport Operators $7.5 $6.5 $5.5 $0.8 $0.8 $0.8
TSA $194.4 $165.9 $136.6 $19.4 $19.4 $19.5
Passengers (Opportunity) $91.9 $78.2 $64.1 $9.2 $9.2 $9.1
Total, Primary $1,969.3 $1,669.5 $1,363.4 $196.9 $195.7 $194.1
Total, High $2,720.7 $2,305.9 $1,882.3 $272.1 $270.3 $268.0
Total, Low $1,239.1 $1,051.2 $859.2 $123.9 $123.2 $122.3
 
Given several areas of uncertainty in the cost estimates, TSA estimates of the total cost of 
the rule range from $859 million to $1.9 billion, discounted at 7%.  In addition to the estimated 
13 
 compliance cost, TSA was unable to model some requirements, such as aircraft operator 
expenses to collect and submit passenger information for watch list matching.  TSA is requesting 
detailed comments to enable quantification of this impact for new and existing operators.  The 
figure below displays the cost segments of the proposed rule grouped into four major cost 
categories as well as the percentage of the total costs they comprise for each of the four major 
affected populations: newly regulated aircraft operators, currently regulated aircraft operators, 
airports, and TSA.

TSA estimated covered aircraft operators would expend $1.1 billion over 10 years to 
comply with the proposed Large Aircraft Security Program, discounted at 7%.  All covered 
aircraft operators would incur costs to develop and submit security programs and profiles.  
Newly regulated aircraft operators would be required to designate security coordinators who 
would perform a variety of security-related duties and complete annual security training.  These 
aircraft operators also would be required to ensure that their flight crewmembers successfully 
undergo security threat assessments (STA) conducted by TSA.  All aircraft operators would need 
to control access to any weapons and check property in the cabin for possible stowaways.  
15 
 Further, aircraft operators would be required to submit names of passengers aboard their flights 
to TSA-approved service providers for purposes of matching names against terrorist watch lists.  
Finally aircraft operators would contract with TSA-approved auditors to undergo biennial 
reviews demonstrating compliance with their security programs. 
This rule would also require a partial airport security program for non-federalized airports 
regularly serving large aircraft in scheduled or public charter operations and airports designated 
by the Secretary of Transportation as “Reliever Airports.”  TSA has determined these airports 
frequently serve as a base for aircraft operators covered by the Large Aircraft Security Program.  
Covered airports would be required to develop and submit security programs to TSA and comply 
with program requirements.  This would entail designation of airport security coordinators and 
completion of attendant training.  TSA estimated airport operators would expend $5.5 million 
over 10 years, discounted at 7%. 
In order to implement and oversee this new security program regime, TSA would expend 
monies to conduct outreach to covered aircraft and airport operators and process security 
programs and profiles, enforce compliance with the proposed requirements, and enroll auditors 
and watch list service providers.  TSA estimated its 10-year costs to implement the proposed 
regulation would range from $133.5 million to $139.8 million, discounted at 7%, with a primary 
estimate of $136.6 million. 
Finally, entities wishing to participate as auditors or watch list service providers would 
incur voluntary costs to apply to TSA for authorization to provide those services.  These service 
entities would likely pass their enrollment expenses to subscribing aircraft operators; thus, in the 
regulatory evaluation TSA assesses the costs directly to the affected aircraft operators.  To avoid 
double-counting, the analysis does not provide a separate estimate of auditor and watch list 
16 
 service provider enrollment costs.  However, TSA has included a description of the enrollment 
process and anticipated unit costs within the discussion of TSA’s costs to process auditor and 
watch list service provider applications.

 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 
 
 
On September 11, 2001, several terrorist attacks were made against the United States that 
resulted in catastrophic human casualties and property damage.  As part of its response to those 
attacks, Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act1 (ATSA), thereby 
establishing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and charging it with the 
responsibility of securing all of the nation’s transportation modes and related infrastructures.  
Under ATSA, TSA’s responsibilities include assessing threats to transportation, developing 
policies, strategies, and plans for dealing with threats to transportation security, and developing, 
implementing, and enforcing security-related regulations and requirements. 
To date, the government’s focus with regard to aviation security generally has been on air 
carriers and commercial aircraft operators, which hold out to the public to offer transportation for 
compensation or hire.  As vulnerabilities and risks for air carriers and commercial operators have 
been reduced or mitigated, terrorists may perceive that general aviation (GA) aircraft are more 
vulnerable and may view them as attractive targets.  If hijacked and used as a missile, these 
aircraft would be capable of inflicting significant damage.  With few exceptions, TSA generally 
does not currently require security programs for general aviation aircraft operators. 
As a result, TSA is proposing to require security programs for all operators, both 
commercial and private, using aircraft having a maximum certificated takeoff weight greater 
than 12,500 pounds (“large aircraft”).  To accomplish this, TSA is proposing to revise part 1544 
of Title 49 in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which governs all TSA domestic aircraft 
operator security programs, by combining certain existing aircraft operator security programs 
                                                 
1  Aviation Transportation Security Act of 2001, Pub. L. no. 107-71, 115 Stat 597 (2001). 
18 
 into a standard Large Aircraft Security Program and expanding the applicability to all operations 
in large aircraft, regardless of the nature of the operation. 
Based on its expertise in aviation security, TSA has determined that aircraft operator 
security programs are more effective when paired with corresponding security programs for the 
airports that serve those aircraft.  Accordingly, TSA has determined that airports identified by the 
Secretary of Transportation as “reliever airports” frequently serve large aircraft operators and is 
thus proposing that these airports have a partial airport security program.  TSA is also proposing 
to require the partial airport security program for non-federalized airports that regularly serve 
scheduled or public charter operations in large aircraft.  The ensuing paragraphs provide a brief 
summary of TSA’s existing security programs and a summary of the proposed rule. 
Regulatory History 
Under its regulatory mandate, and in accordance with ATSA requirements to ensure the 
adequacy of security screening of certain airport, air carrier, and aircraft employees, as well as 
air passengers, cargo, property, and baggage, TSA issued the following aircraft and airport 
operator security program regulations:

! Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (FACAOSSP)3

49 CFR part 1542 (Airport Operators) 
 
! Airport Security Program (ASP)9 
! Supporting Airport Security Program10 
! Partial Airport Security Program11 
 
One commonality among all of these security programs, both aircraft and airport 
operator, is their applicability to operations for compensation or hire using “large aircraft,” those 
having a maximum certificated takeoff weight (MTOW) greater than 12,500 pounds.  Beyond 
this similarity, these programs can be generally divided into two main categories: security 
programs for operators providing scheduled service (AOSSP, FACAOSSP) and security 
programs for operators providing a mix of scheduled and private or on-demand service (PCSSP, 
PPSSSP, TFSSP, TFSSP-AC).  Because TSA views aviation security as a unit, airport operator 
security programs are linked to the types of aircraft operations they serve.  Thus, airports 
regularly serving AOSSP operators are required to have an ASP, airports regularly serving 
PCSSP operators must have a supporting airport security program, and airports regularly serving 
PPSSP operators must have a partial airport security program.  The following paragraphs provide 
a brief summary of these security programs and the types of operators to which they apply. 
Aircraft Operator Security Programs 
The AOSSP is the standard security program for full program operators.  A full program 
operation (as defined in 49 CFR part 1544.101) is: a scheduled passenger or public charter 
passenger operation with an aircraft having a passenger seating configuration of 61 or more 
seats; or a scheduled passenger or public charter passenger operation with an aircraft having a

20 
 passenger seating configuration of 60 or fewer seats when passengers are enplaned from or 
deplaned into a sterile area.  Most aircraft operators meeting these criteria are large commercial 
airlines offering regularly scheduled passenger service between fixed locations. 
The FACAOSSP applies to aircraft operators using aircraft with a MTOW of more than 
45,500 kg (100,309.3 pounds) that are carrying cargo and authorized persons (but no 
passengers).  Aircraft operators subject to the FACAOSSP are similar to AOSSP operators in 
that they advertise to the public regularly scheduled service between fixed locations; however, 
these operators carry cargo instead of passengers.  Companies such as DHL, FedEx, and UPS 
would be examples of FACAOSSP aircraft operators. 
The PCSSP, first issued in June of 2002, and amended on December 31, 2002, applies to 
privately chartered aircraft (aircraft hired by, and for, one specific group of people) having a 
MTOW greater than 45,500 kg (100,309.3 pounds); or a passenger seating configuration of 61 or 
more seats; or, that enplane from or deplane into a sterile area.  To be considered a private 
charter, the charterer must have engaged the total passenger capacity of the aircraft, invited all of 
the passengers, borne all of the costs of the charter, and must not have advertised to the public in 
any way to solicit passengers. 
Additionally, the PCSSP applies to chartered flights where the total passenger capacity of 
the aircraft is used for the purpose of government civilian or military air travel conducted under 
contract with the government of the U.S. or the government of a foreign country; however, the 
rule exempts government charters from the screening requirement, unless they enplane from or 
deplane into a sterile area.  TSA estimated that approximately 77 operators, utilizing 385 aircraft, 
were conducting operations solely or primarily under the PCSSP at the time of writing. 
21 
 The PPSSP, issued on February 22, 2002, applies to scheduled passenger or public 
charter passenger operations using aircraft with seating configurations of 31 or more, but 60 or 
fewer seats that do not enplane from or deplane into a sterile area; and to scheduled passenger or 
public charter passenger operations using aircraft with seating configurations of 60 or fewer seats 
engaged in operations to, from, or outside the United States that do not enplane from or deplane 
into a sterile area.  
The TFSSP, issued on February 22, 2002, applies to operations using aircraft with a 
maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 12,500 pounds or more; in scheduled or charter service; 
carrying passengers or cargo or both; and not presently required to have either a full or partial 
security program.  Many of these operators offer on-demand passenger service and are frequently 
referred to as “air taxis.”  TFSSP operators may also transport cargo or use their aircraft for 
private operations.  Some may even offer limited scheduled service between smaller airports 
which are not required to have a TSA security program. 
The requirements of the PPSSP are identical to those of the TFSSP, with the exception 
that the PPSSP requires operators to participate in airport operator-sponsored exercises of airport 
contingency plans.  TSA estimated that approximately 649 operators, utilizing 4,543 large 
aircraft, were conducting operations either solely or primarily under the TFSSP or PPSSP at the 
time of writing. (Within the text of the regulatory evaluation, Twelve-Five and Partial Program 
operators may be referred to collectively as TFSSP operators due to the extremely small number 
of Partial Program operators, the similarities between the two groups, and the fact that they 
would be merged under the proposed regulation). 
TSA requires operators meeting the applicability criteria for the TFSSP but conducting 
all-cargo operations to meet the requirements of the TFSSP-AC, which has additional procedures 
22 
 for the acceptance and screening of cargo and screening of authorized persons.  At the time of 
writing, TSA estimated that approximately 48 operators, utilizing 960 aircraft, were conducting 
operations either solely or primarily under the TFSSP-AC.  
Finally, Limited Programs are those security programs other than the security programs 
identified above that TSA may approve after receiving a request by an aircraft operator holding a 
certificate under 14 CFR part 119.  Limited Program operators must adopt and carry out a 
security program that meets the applicable requirements of 1544.103(c), selected provisions of 
subparts C,D, and E of §1544.103, and the provisions of §1544.305.  TSA has authorized very 
few Limited security programs. 
Of all these aircraft operator security programs, the TFSSP forms the “base” security 
program in that it embodies the minimum requirements from 49 CFR part 1544 that TSA has 
determined an aircraft operator needs to meet in order to have an acceptable level of security.  
The other programs progressively build upon those requirements, with the AOSSP and the 
FACAOSSP being the most robust security programs. 
Airport Operator Security Programs 
The ASP, transferred from the FAA to TSA in 2002, is implemented by each airport 
operator regularly serving operations of an AOSSP aircraft operator or a foreign air carrier 
described in §1546.101(a).  Each regulated airport must establish and implement a security 
program that includes a description of secured areas, each activity or entity on or adjacent to a 
secured area that affects security, measures used to perform the access control functions required 
under §1542.201(b)(1), and procedures to control movement within the secured area, including 
identification media required under § 1542.201(b)(3). 
23 
 The supporting airport security program applies to airports regularly serving operations 
of those aircraft operators or foreign air carriers described in §1544.101(a)(2) or (f), or 
§1546.101(b) or (c).  This means the supporting airport security program applies to airports 
primarily serving private charter operators and scheduled passenger or public charter passenger 
operations with an aircraft having a passenger seating configuration of 60 or fewer seats, when 
passengers are enplaned from or deplaned into a sterile area.  The supporting airport security 
program directs airport operators to designate and train airport security coordinators, establish 
procedures for public advisories and incident management, provide law enforcement personnel 
to support the security program, and develop an airport contingency plan. 
The partial airport security program applies to airports regularly serving operations of 
those aircraft operators or foreign air carriers described in 49 CFR §1544.101(b) or 
§1546.101(d), which corresponds to aircraft operators operating under a PPSSP.  The partial 
airport security program is identical to the supporting airport security program, with the 
exception that TSA does not require an airport contingency plan for airports under the partial 
airport security program.  
Summary of the Proposed Regulation 
As identified in the Regulatory History section above, the applicability of each of these 
security programs presently is linked to a combination of factors, including the size, seating 
configuration, and type of operation in which an aircraft is engaged.  Regardless of the specific 
nature of the operation, however, whether scheduled commercial service or private charter, 
nearly all aircraft operators currently regulated by TSA under 49 CFR part 1544 engage in 
“common carriage.”12  Common carriage means any operation for compensation or hire where 
                                                 
12 TSA does require a TFSSP or PCSSP for certain aircraft conducting operations under the FAA’s 14 CFR part 125.  
While part 125 operators engage in noncommon carriage, their operations exhibit traits of common carriage. 
24 
 the operator holds itself out as willing to furnish transportation to any member of the public 
seeking the services offered.  TSA does not currently regulate operators engaged in 
“noncommon, or private, carriage.”  Noncommon carriage does not involve offering or holding 
out by the operator through advertising or any other means.  Noncommon carriage includes the 
following:  
! Carriage of operator’s own employees or property 
! Carriage of participating members of a club 
! Carriage of persons and property which is only incidental to the operator’s 
primary business 
! Carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire under a contractual 
business arrangement that did not result from the operator’s holding out or 
offering.  In this situation, the customer seeks out an operator to perform the 
desired service and enters into an exclusive mutual agreement; the operator does 
not seek out the customer.  
 
This leads to a situation where an operator regulated by TSA may operate the same large 
aircraft both with and without a security program, depending on whether the aircraft is being 
used for common or noncommon carriage.  For example, a large jet would be required to operate 
under a TSA security program while flying from a GA facility in Dallas to a GA facility in San 
Diego because it was operating as a charter for a college sports team.  That same jet, however, 
could then immediately pick up its corporate owners and fly to a GA facility in Chicago.  This 
second flight would be exempt from the requirement to have a security program because the 
aircraft was no longer conducting service for compensation or hire. 
TSA has thus determined that while there is greater risk associated with certain types of 
operations in large aircraft, such as scheduled commercial service, all large aircraft should be 
required to operate under a security program at all times.  Consequently, TSA is proposing a new 
rule, the “Large Aircraft Security Program” or LASP, that would both combine the standard 
security programs governing large aircraft in scheduled, on-demand, or private charter operations 
25 
 (PCSSP, PPSSP, TFSSP, TFSSP-AC) and expand the coverage to include almost all 
noncommon carriage operations in large aircraft, which would include both corporate and private 
operations. 
TSA has determined the proposed regulation would primarily affect two new categories 
of operators.  The first and largest group would be operators using aircraft exclusively for 
personal or business purposes.  They are currently regulated by the FAA under 14 CFR part 91 
and are referred to throughout this analysis simply as “Part 91 operators.”  Contrary to operators 
currently holding TSA security programs, these operators do not hire their aircraft out to others.  
TSA had considerable difficulty determining how many operators currently conduct operations 
under Part 91, as no centralized data source currently exists.  Based on communication with 
industry associations, TSA subject matter experts estimated approximately 9,000 Part 91 
operators would be subject to the proposed requirements of the Large Aircraft Security Program.  
 
The second group is comprised of aircraft operators that use large aircraft able to carry 
6,000 pounds or more of payload capacity and 20 or more passenger seats to provide transport 
services for a limited number of clients.  These operators provide their services in accordance 
with long-term contracts negotiated directly with clients, typically no more than 3 or 4, and are 
regulated by the FAA under 14 CFR part 125.  TSA refers to these aircraft operators throughout 
the analysis as “Part 125 operators.”  Because Part 125 operators provide services to other 
companies, their operations appear to be similar to those of aircraft operators currently required 
to hold TSA security programs, and in some cases Part 125 operators have implemented TSA 
security programs due to the nature of their operations.  By definition, however, Part 125 
operators provide noncommon carriage.  As is the case for Part 91 operators, very little 
comprehensive information exists on the number of Part 125 operators.  Industry experts 
26 
 estimated there are approximately 100 aircraft operators regularly conducting operations under 
Part 125.  TSA has estimated that 39 of these Part 125 operators currently have a TSA security 
program, while 61 would be newly regulated under the proposed rule.  TSA welcomes comments 
on both its Part 91 and Part 125 population estimates. 
By extending security program requirements to previously unregulated segments of GA, 
the proposed LASP would help mitigate the risk that “large aircraft” could be commandeered by 
terrorists for use as weapons.  To achieve this risk reduction, TSA analyzed the existing security 
programs to determine which security measures have been effective and would be appropriate 
for inclusion in the proposed LASP. 
TSA has proposed that the basic LASP be modeled on the TFSSP, with separate 
components containing additional requirements for aircraft operators that meet the criteria for 
PCSSP operators or TFSSP-AC operators.  Based on its review, TSA has also determined 
additional requirements are necessary in order to reduce the number of aircraft operators having 
access to the watch list and to enable the Agency to effectively oversee the substantial increase in 
the number of security programs resulting from the inclusion of GA operators. 
Thus, the proposed rule would require, among other things, that all large aircraft 
operators match passenger names against the watch list through a TSA-approved watch list 
service provider; contract with TSA-approved auditors to demonstrate compliance with their 
security programs and TSA regulations; designate Aircraft Operator, Ground, and In-Flight 
Security Coordinators and train Ground and In-Flight Security Coordinators; complete security 
threat assessments on flight crewmembers; ensure that weapons and explosives are inaccessible 
to passengers; ensure that law enforcement personnel are available to respond to incidents as 
27 
 28 
needed; and, allow law enforcement officers (LEOs) to carry their weapons onboard an aircraft 
(provided applicable regulatory requirements are followed). 
Since aircraft operators currently operating under TSA security programs already comply 
with some of these requirements, Figure 4 presents each of the proposed requirements and 
indicates for each type of covered aircraft operator whether the requirement is currently required 
and would continue, is a new requirement, or is not applicable.

 Besides modifying and consolidating large GA aircraft security requirements, the 
proposed rule would require the following airports to establish and implement the standards and 
procedures of the partial airport security program: 
! Each airport regularly serving large aircraft covered by the LASP engaged in scheduled 
or public charter operations. 
! Each reliever airport that the Secretary of Transportation designates to relieve congestion 
at a commercial service airport, as defined in 49 U.S.C. 47102. 
 
Many airports that serve scheduled passenger aircraft operations have either an ASP or 
supporting airport security program.  The proposed rule would require airports that do not 
already operate under one of these programs to adopt the partial airport security program if they 
regularly serve large aircraft engaged in scheduled or public charter operations.  TSA has 
identified approximately 42 airports we believe would be affected by this proposal. 
Reliever airports, described in the second bullet, would be newly regulated by TSA under 
the proposed rule.  These are general aviation airports identified by the Secretary of 
Transportation as being capable of relieving traffic at commercial service airports.13  As a result, 
these airports are frequently located near metropolitan areas and are capable of handling large 
aircraft operations.  Based on FAA data, TSA determined there are a total of 276 reliever 
airports, of which 3 already hold a TSA security program.   
Together, the Cost of Compliance section below identifies costs for 315 airports to 
comply with the proposed rule.

 PUBLIC COMMENTS RELATED TO ECONOMIC ISSUES 
 
 
 
TSA is here responding to economic comments received in response to the May 2002 
Twelve-Five and Private Charter interim final rules.  These responses were included in the 
regulatory evaluations accompanying the December 2002 interim final rules.  Those regulatory 
evaluations were not released to the public, however, because the documents contained sensitive 
security information (SSI).  TSA has determined the comments and responses do not contain SSI 
and has reproduced them in this document for public release.  The responses to these comments 
would also be applicable to operators affected by the proposed LASP. 
Three commenters addressed affordability of compliance with the Twelve-Five final rule.  
One commenter that has a two-person flight department said that it could not afford to hire 
additional staff.  Another asked that the pilot-in-command (PIC) be allowed to serve as the GSC 
as well as the ISC.  A third commenter said that compliance with the Twelve-Five final rule 
would cost $34,000.  
The TSA response in the Twelve-Five final rule was that the rule does not require 
affected operators to hire new employees to meet the requirement to have an AOSC, GSC, or 
ISC.  The same person may serve in two or all three of these roles; however, that person may not 
serve in more than two of those roles for any given flight. 
Three commenters addressed the restrictions of carriage of weapons onboard aircraft 
affected by the Twelve-Five rule.  Two asked for a definition of an “appropriate container” for 
carriage of weapons and to clarify whether bodyguards for VIP passengers would be allowed to 
carry weapons while in flight.  Another asked if the practice of separating weapons from 
passengers in flight would be an acceptable means of compliance. 
32 
 The TSA response under the Twelve-Five final rule was that the security program states 
that a “locked baggage storage area that is inaccessible to passengers during flight may be 
considered an appropriate container.”  A weapon that is separated from the passenger, stored in 
an appropriate container, and remains inaccessible to passengers during the flight is in 
compliance.  Alternately, if the aircraft does not have an inaccessible cargo hold where the 
weapon may be placed, the use of a trigger guard would also be considered in compliance as 
long as the key remained under the direct control of the In-flight Security Coordinator for the 
duration of the flight. In these instances, the weapon is considered inaccessible to the persons on 
board. 
33 
 BENEFITS  
 
 
 
The proposed rule would yield two main security benefits.  First, it would expand the 
mandatory use of security measures to certain operators of large aircraft that are not currently 
required to have security programs.  These measures would deter malicious individuals from 
perpetrating acts that might compromise transportation or national security by using large aircraft 
for these purposes.  Second, it would standardize, as appropriate, security measures used by a 
single operator in its various operations and between different operators.  These benefits are 
derived from standardization of watch list matching, expanding mandatory security operations to 
all large aircraft operators, and, finally, by requiring all covered large aircraft operators to 
maintain security programs.  
The proposed rulemaking also yields two other benefits.  The proposed rule would bring 
all security programs for large aircraft not covered by an AOSSP under one general regulatory 
framework.  This can provide for better governance of and for stakeholders.  The rule would also 
ensure comprehensive oversight of security programs where it may not exist today.  This would 
ensure that operators’ security programs are not unintentionally deficient. 
Finally, TSA has included a rough “break-even” analysis which indicates the tradeoffs 
between program cost and program benefits (in the form of impact on baseline risk of a 
significant aviation-related terror attack) that would be required for the Large Aircraft Security 
Program to be a cost beneficial undertaking. 
34 
 Watch List Matching 
The proposed rule would increase aviation security through two changes in the area of 
watch list matching.  The rule would expand passenger matching against watch lists and would 
reduce the number of non-governmental entities that have direct access to the Federal watch lists. 
The proposed rule would expand watch list matching of passengers to large aircraft not 
already covered by a TFSSP, PPSSP or PCSSP.  Individuals on the terrorist watch list pose a 
threat to security when flying on large aircraft.  Weaponization of large aircraft poses a security 
risk, which can be mitigated in part by preventing individuals known to pose a security risk from 
flying on large aircraft.  The expanded watch list matching would help to ensure that individuals 
who are known to pose a security risk do not fly on large aircraft. 
The proposed rule would also reduce the number of non-governmental entities that have 
direct access to Federal watch lists.  Currently, 774 aircraft operators with a Twelve-Five or 
Private Charter Program check passenger information against the No Fly List, which is sensitive 
security information.14  The current method of matching against the No Fly List requires that 
each of these operators have direct access to the No Fly List.  The proposed rule would require 
all operators covered under the LASP rule to use TSA-approved watch list service provider.  At 
this time, TSA is projecting a range of approximately 10 to 30 approved providers, substantially 
less than 774.  This consolidation benefits security in two ways.  First, reducing the distribution 
of the list also reduces the opportunity for the list to be compromised.  Second, consolidation of 
watch list matching operations would also assist in greater standardization of matching methods.  
Consolidated operations would facilitate the discovery of best practices and may assist in the 
discovery of inconsistencies in the matching process.  Together, these two changes in watch list 
matching methods would enhance security. 
                                                 
14 Sensitive security information (SSI) is controlled under 49 CFR parts 15 and 1520.  
35 
 Expanding Security Operations  
The proposed rule would continue to govern the security operations of current TFSSP, 
PCSSP, and PPSSP operators but it would expand those requirements to all flights by those 
operators, regardless of purpose, and the rest of the large GA aircraft industry as well.  
Expanding security requirements to all large GA aircraft operations would reduce vulnerabilities 
in those segments of the industry that are currently unregulated but nevertheless may have just as 
much potential risk as the currently regulated parts of the industry.  Finally, the rule would 
require all covered aircraft operators to engage in activities that would enhance aviation security 
and / or safety. 
  Under the proposed rule, large aircraft operators would be required to: 
! Transmit passenger information to watch list service provider for watch list 
matching; 
! check property in the cabin for possible stowaways; 
! ensure that non-LEO passengers do not have access to weapons onboard the 
aircraft; 
! fly with FAMs onboard as directed by TSA; 
! secure the aircraft and related facilities; 
! run STAs on flight crew;  
! provide security training for security coordinators and crew;  
! comply with security directives and information circulars; 
! Adopt/implement security program;  
! Be subject to independent third-party audits of compliance with their security 
programs; and, 
! Appoint security coordinators. 
 
 
Performing the above security operations would help reduce the probability and impacts 
of aviation security incidents involving large aircraft. 
Expanding Security Programs  
The expansion of security programs would require most large aircraft operators to: 
! appoint security coordinators; 
! establish training programs for individual security-related duties; 
36 
 ! establish programs to permit passengers to provide volunteer emergency 
services; 
! develop and implement contingency plans in response to threats; and, 
! participate in airport contingency plans. 
 
Aircraft operators’ inclusion of each of the above in their security programs would 
enhance their ability to respond to potential and actual security incidents involving large aircraft 
in the future. 
Consolidation of Regulatory Regimen  
The proposed rule would combine several similar regulatory programs into a 
consolidated regulatory framework.  Generally, consolidated regulatory regimens are preferable 
to disparate regulations, each of which may have pieces affecting any given sub-sector of an 
industry.  Meanwhile, the new regulatory framework would continue to foster customization of 
security programs based upon the type of operation as before and thus avoids a “one-size fits all” 
scheme.  These concepts foster better governance.  This single-face approach to regulation of 
similar populations would enhance government responsiveness to all stakeholders. 
Security Program Oversight 
The proposed regulation would require audits of operators’ compliance with their 
security programs for large aircraft operators.  This would help the government identify 
operators that are not in compliance with their security programs.  While large aircraft operators 
would be required to maintain security programs, due to TSA resource constraints, those 
programs might not be subject to periodic review as frequent as that proposed under the audit 
requirement.  The proposed audit requirement would help to ensure that all security programs 
meet the requirements of the regulation.  
37 
 Break-even Analysis 
A break-even analysis for a rulemaking such as the Large Aircraft Security Program is 
aimed at framing the relationships between the effects of the rulemaking (in increasing domestic 
security and reducing the risk of terror attack), the cost of implementing the rule, and the 
baseline risks of domestic terror attacks which would be improved by the rulemaking.  Ideally, 
the quantification and monetization of the beneficial security effects of this regulation would 
involve two steps.  First, TSA would estimate the reduction in the probability of a successful 
terrorist attack resulting from implementation of the regulation and the consequences of the 
avoided event (collectively, the risk associated with a potential terrorist attack).  Then TSA 
would identify individuals’ willingness to pay for this incremental risk reduction and multiply it 
by the population experiencing the benefit.  Both of these steps, however, rely on key data that 
are not available for this rule. 
In light of these limitations, TSA conducted a “break-even” analysis to determine what 
reduction of overall risk of a terror attack and resulting reduction in the expected losses for the 
nation due to a terror attack would be necessary in order for the expected benefits of the rule to 
exceed the costs.  Because the types of attacks that would be prevented by this regulation vary 
widely in their intensity and effects, depending both on the intent of those undertaking the attack 
and their effectiveness in completing it, TSA considered four example attack scenarios and the 
monetized losses associated with each.  Similar break-even analyses have been undertaken in 
support of other DHS rules, and TSA has coordinated the current analysis with these earlier ones, 
with the aim of maintaining consistency in DHS analyses and results.  In the case of the LASP 
proposed rule, some of the types of terror attacks that might be undertaken using aircraft 
operated by those covered under the proposed rule are similar to those that were considered by 
38 
 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and this similarity has informed the current analysis 
and examples.  For one scenario, however, TSA has relied on DHS research into the effects of 
successful delivery of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) by an aircraft of the type affected 
by the proposed rule.  The conclusions of this DHS research are consistent with results from 
existing academic and think tank research into similar issues.   
In order to compare the losses associated with each scenario to the cost of the proposed 
rule, TSA converted casualties into a monetary total.  TSA used the Value of a Statistical Life 
(VSL) of $5.8 million that is used by the Department of Transportation (DOT), and which was 
recently revised to reflect current academic and other research into this quantity.15  The VSL 
represents the sum of individuals’ willingness to pay to avoid an incremental risk of death; it is 
based on studies of the value individuals place on small changes in risk, and therefore does not 
place a value on an actual individual life.  Similarly, based on the same DOT guidance, TSA 
valued moderate injuries at 1.55 percent of the VSL and severe injuries at 18.75 percent of the 
VSL.  TSA emphasizes that the VSL is a statistical value placed on the sum of small changes in 
risk for regulatory comparison, and does not suggest that the actual value of a particular 
individual’s life can be stated in dollar terms. 
The following paragraphs present a description of the three scenarios considered by TSA 
with corresponding estimates of their monetary consequences.  These scenarios make up a wide 
range of possible consequences, which reflects the varied opportunities for attack and targeting 
that may exist for those intent on doing the nation harm.  In order to compare direct costs to 
direct benefits, TSA only presents the direct economic losses estimated to ensue from the attack

 scenarios and has omitted economic “ripple effects” and economic transfers from its 
calculations. 
Scenario 1 contemplates a situation where a large aircraft is used as a missile to attack an 
unpopulated or lightly populated area, resulting in minimal loss of life, moderate injuries and 
destruction of the aircraft.  Of the scenarios considered, this is the most restrained in its level of 
envisioned harm.  It is assumed that a loss of 3 lives occurs, along with 10 moderate injuries and 
the complete hull loss of the aircraft.  Using the DOT VSL of $5.8 million, the monetary 
estimate associated with the loss of life is $17.4 million.  Again using DOT guidance, moderate 
injuries to those affected are valued at 1.55% of the VSL, or $89,900.  To estimate the value of 
the lost aircraft, TSA used $9.3 million, which is the 2008 average market value of a General 
Aviation jet aircraft weighing between 12,500 and 65,000 pounds.16  Taken together, the 
monetary consequence of this scenario totals $32 million, or $0.032 billion.   
Scenario 2 also contemplates a situation where a large aircraft is used as a missile to 
attack a populated area, resulting in significantly greater loss of life and injuries, and destruction 
of the aircraft.  It is assumed that a loss of 250 lives occurs, along with 250 severe injuries and 
the complete hull loss of the aircraft.  Using the DOT VSL of $5.8 million, the monetary 
estimate associated with the loss of life is $1.45 billion.  Again using DOT guidance, severe 
injuries to those affected are valued at between 1.55% and 18.75% of the VSL, or between 
$90,000 and $1.1 million.  This range implies a value of the lost injuries in this scenario of 
between $67.5 million and $816 million.  Because we used the lower value of the injury 
valuation range in the first scenario, however, we will use only the upper value of the injury

and the 2003 estimate of $7.2 million was brought to the 2008 value of $9.3 million using the FAA recommended 
method described in the document in Section 9.6 (page 9-9), which relies on the BLS producer price index series for 
civil aircraft, available in the producer price index values for commodities at http://stats.bls.gov/ppi/home.htm .

 valuation range to monetize this scenario.   To estimate the value of the lost aircraft, TSA used 
$9.3 million, which is the 2008 average market value of a General Aviation jet aircraft weighing 
between 12,500 and 65,000 pounds.  Taken together, the monetary consequence of this scenario 
totals $1.73 billion.  The level of damage in this type of scenario is consistent with the scenarios 
considered for the CBP APIS Final Rule analysis, although the current analysis also includes a 
component of severe injuries.17  
Scenario 3 contemplates a situation where a large aircraft is used as a missile to carry out 
a direct attack on a building in a densely populated urban area.  Because of these locational 
details, a successful attack would result in much more severe consequences, including 
significantly increased loss of life and widespread real property damage, compared to Scenario 1.  
For valuation purposes for this scenario, TSA assumes 3,000 fatalities, valued at $17.4 billion 
using the DOT VSL of $5.8 million.  To maintain consistency with existing DHS analyses, in 
particular the APIS analysis,18 TSA assumes property losses totaling $21.8 billion; this total is 
motivated by comparison to the City of New York Comptroller’s estimate of direct losses to the 
city due to the September 11 attacks.19  However, TSA also assumes that 9,000 severe injuries 
would also result from such an attack.  These severe injuries, valued at 18.75% of the VSL based 
on the DOT guidance, have a monetary valuation of $9.79 billion.  Finally, based on the FAA 
estimate of aircraft value, losses in Scenario 3 include $9.3 million due to complete hull loss of 
the aircraft used in the attack.  The scenario elements aggregate to a total consequence of $49.0 
billion.

 Finally, Scenario 4 contemplates a catastrophic situation in which a large aircraft is used 
to deliver a nuclear or biohazard device to an urban center.  The costs associated with a scenario 
such as this have been examined by DHS in detail for a nuclear device.20  This research 
concludes that the consequences of such an event would be immense, with a wide range of 
uncertainty.  For the present analysis, TSA is using a value of $1 trillion for the direct 
consequences of an attack of this severity.  This value falls in the midrange of the values 
developed in the DHS research, and is consistent with results obtained from a review of 
academic and think tank research into the consequences of nuclear and bioterror attacks on urban 
areas.  The value of $1 trillion results from loss of life in an attacked urban area in the hundreds 
of thousands and enormous loss of property and other productive assets.   
Figure 5 reports the impacts and monetary consequences identified for each of these 
scenarios.  TSA compared the extent of monetary consequence from a successful attack with the 
cost of the proposed LASP.  The annual risk reductions required for the proposed rule to break 
even under each of the three scenarios are presented in Figure 6.  In this analysis the comparison 
is made between the estimated scenario consequence and the annualized LASP  cost of $194.1 
million (based on a 7% discount rate); the “required risk reduction” for breakeven is simply the 
ratio between this annualized program cost and the scenario consequence total.  As shown, 
depending on the attack scenario, underlying baseline risk of terror attack would have to be 
reduced less than 1 percent (Scenarios 3 and 4) to 11.2 percent (Scenario 2) in order for the rule 
to break even.  Preventing the impact envisioned in Scenario 1 is not sufficient to offset the 
LASP program costs even if the risk of a Scenario 1 outcome in a given year were a certainty 
(baseline likelihood of a Scenario 1 event equal to 100%) and the risk was eliminated entirely 
(100 percent risk reduction

While the “required risk reduction” due to LASP can be quantified, its units are the 
absolute risk reduction required.  A further consideration is therefore whether the underlying risk 
of an attack is large enough that such an absolute risk reduction is possible or plausible.  The 
relationship of required risk reduction to underlying baseline risk of attack (which is the risk that 
would be reduced by an effective LASP program) can be more clearly illustrated graphically 
using a breakeven frontier.  This is especially so because while the amount by which baseline 
risk must be reduced by LASP if LASP is to be cost-beneficial can be directly calculated as a 
ratio of program costs to attack consequences, the underlying baseline risk of an attack in any 
given year is not only highly uncertain, but also variable over time.  At any given time, it can be 
calculated with greater accuracy only through reliance on highly security-sensitive information.  
Such a break-even frontier graphic is depicted in Figure 6

. 
In this figure, breakeven curves are shown for three of the attack consequence scenarios.  
(The Minimal scenario is not depicted in the figure, because the monetary impact of that scenario 
is exceeded by the annualized cost of the LASP program, meaning that the minimal scenario is 
not sufficient when considered alone to make the program cost beneficial if the program 
eliminated all risk of one such attack.)  Moving from the northeast corner of the figure in a 
southwesterly direction, the curves depict the Moderate consequence scenario (Scenario 2), the 
Major consequence scenario (Scenario 3) and the Catastrophic consequence scenario (Scenario 
4).  Along the horizontal axis is measured the baseline annual probability or likelihood of a terror 
44 
 attack involving an aircraft.  In the figure, these values run from 0 percent – no chance of such an 
attack – to 20 percent.  The baseline risk could have been extended out to 100 percent (meaning 
that an annual attack is a certainty), but this would add little information to that already depicted.  
It is useful to relate program impact to a range of levels for baseline risk (0 to 20 percent, in this 
figure), because baseline risk may vary over time, as geopolitical and other factors change, and 
different decision-makers may have individual views on just what value is taken by the baseline 
risk.  Along the vertical axis is the proportionate reduction in baseline risk due to LASP.  These 
values range from 0 percent to 100 percent.  A completely ineffective program would not reduce 
baseline risk at all (taking a 0 percent value on this axis) and a completely effective program, 
relative to baseline risk, would take a 100 percent value on this axis.  If, for example, the 
baseline risk of an event is judged to be 10 percent, and the proportionate risk reduction provided 
by the program were 50 percent, then the risk of an event AFTER the program has been 
deployed would be 5 percent (50 percent of 10 percent).  Whether such an outcome is cost 
beneficial depends, of course, on the program’s annualized cost and the impact or consequence 
of the attack to be deterred or prevented. 
For a given breakeven frontier, points along the curve are exactly breakeven with respect 
to the scenario defining the frontier, in the sense that the program provides a risk reduction that 
reduces the expected loss due to a successful attack by exactly the cost of the program itself.  
Points to the northeast of the frontier are cost-beneficial for that scenario in that they indicate that 
the program provides more than enough annual risk reduction (and reduction in expected loss to 
terror attack) to cover their annualized costs.  Points to the southwest of a frontier are not cost-
beneficial with respect to the scenario, since they indicate that the program does not provide 
enough risk reduction – expressed in the figure as proportionate reduction baseline risk – to 
45 
 justify the program costs.  The break-even frontier presentation is useful as a depiction of the 
relationship between baseline likelihood of an attack and the extent to which a program reduces 
that baseline risk because it is precisely that  baseline risk that is uncertain or a matter of 
disagreement for decision-makers.  If baseline risk were precisely known, the trade-off 
comparisons for a range of break-even risk levels provided by the break-even frontier would be 
extraneous. 
As indicated in the figure, for Moderate Attack Consequences, if the underlying baseline 
risk is 11.2 percent or less, the program cannot be not cost beneficial, since on its own it must 
reduce baseline risk by 11.2 percent to be cost beneficial.  At the other extreme, for the 
Catastrophic Attack Consequence scenario (and, to a lesser degree, the Major Attack 
Consequence scenario), the program is cost beneficial for most values of baseline risk, since the 
impact of such an attack is so sizeable relative to the annualized program cost.

 COST OF COMPLIANCE 
 
 
 
Aircraft operators, airport operators, and the Transportation Security Administration 
would incur costs to comply with the requirements of the proposed Large Aircraft Security 
Program rule.  TSA estimated the total 10-year cost of the program at $1.4 billion, discounted at 
7%.  Using the annualized cost of $194.1 million (at a 7% discount rate), and a range of the 
average number of flights annually (Figure 7), based on two distinct approaches to annual 
activity counts which are described below, the annualized total rule cost per flight ranges 
between $17 and $71 per flight.

* Calculation based on annual IFR flight activity identified in DOT ETMS database and FAA forecast 
growth rates for GA flight activity.  
** Calculation based on annual flight estimates provided by TSA and industry subject matter experts 
for each of the covered LASP aircraft operator populations.  
Aircraft operator costs comprise nearly all of the estimated expense.  This is due to the 
large number of newly regulated aircraft operators and the anticipated time security coordinators 
would spend on their duties.  Given several areas of uncertainty in the cost estimates, the total 
cost of the rule was estimated to range from $859 million to $1.9 billion, discounted at 7%; with 
47 
 the primary estimate at $1.4 billion.  TSA estimated costs for aircraft operators to utilize WLSP 
and third party auditing firms as the cost to provide watch list matching services plus overhead 
and profit and the opportunity costs incurred by passengers newly required to provide personal 
identity information before traveling.  TSA requests detailed comments to enable more precise 
quantification of this impact, both for new and existing operators. 
Figure 8 shows the total estimated cost of the rule by affected population in constant 
2006 dollars; total costs are shown discounted at 3% and 7%.  The following figures display 
totals by cost category for each of these affected populations, and the ensuing sections discuss 
the processes and associated costs underlying these total estimates for each of the affected 
populations.

As shown in Figure 9, TSA estimated covered aircraft operators would expend $1.1 
billion over 10 years to comply with the proposed Large Aircraft Security Program, discounted 
at 7%.  All covered aircraft operators would incur costs to develop and submit security programs 
and profiles and ensure that their flight crews successfully undergo STAs conducted by TSA.

 Newly regulated aircraft operators would be required to designate security coordinators who 
would perform a variety of security-related duties and complete annual security training.  All 
aircraft operators would need to control access to any weapons and screen any accessible 
property in the cabin.  Aircraft operators would be required to expend time for requesting and 
recording  personal information from their prospective passengers.  Further, aircraft operators 
would be required to submit names of all persons aboard their flights to TSA-approved service 
providers for purposes of matching names against terrorist watch lists.  In addition, aircraft 
operators would contract a WLSP to provide watch list matching for passengers.  Finally aircraft 
operators would contract with TSA-approved auditors to undergo biennial reviews demonstrating 
compliance with their security programs.  As the security coordinator duties are the most 
significant cost of this rulemaking, TSA specifically requests comment on the impacts associated 
with this requirement.

 Entities wishing to participate as auditors or watch list service providers would incur 
costs to apply to TSA for authorization to provide those services.  Firms providing auditing and 
watch list services would likely pass their enrollment expenses to subscribing aircraft operators; 
thus, in this analysis TSA assesses the costs directly to the affected aircraft operators.   
Since TSA views security programs as a package, this rule would also require a partial 
airport security program for airports regularly serving scheduled and public charter operations in 
large aircraft as well as airports designated by the FAA as “reliever airports.”  Covered airports 
would be required to develop and submit security programs to TSA and comply with program 
requirements.  This would entail designation of airport security coordinators and completion of 
the attendant training.  TSA estimated airport operators would expend $5.5 million over 10 
years, discounted at 7%.  Figure 10 shows the estimated 10-year costs of compliance for airport 
operators in constant 2006 dollars, as well as total costs discounted at 3% and 7%.

In order to implement and oversee this new security program regime, TSA would expend 
monies to conduct outreach to covered aircraft and airport operators and process security 
programs and profiles, to enforce compliance with the proposed requirements, and to enroll 
50 
 auditors and watch list service providers.  TSA estimated its 10-year costs to implement the 
proposed regulation would range from $133.5 million to $139.8 million, discounted at 7%, with 
a primary estimate of $134.6 million.  Figure 11 shows the estimated 10-year costs by category

Entities wishing to participate as auditors or watch list service providers would incur 
costs to apply to TSA for authorization to provide those services.  Firms providing auditing and 
watch list services would likely pass their enrollment expenses to subscribing aircraft operators; 
thus, in this analysis TSA assesses the costs directly to the affected aircraft operators.   
 
 Finally, passengers on aircraft operations newly covered by the proposed regulation 
would be required to provide personal information to flight departments or other flight office 
personnel for matching against watch lists.  This process will be slightly time consuming and 
will therefore impose an opportunity cost on passengers, which is a cost of the proposed rule.  
Based on the estimated number of passengers in this industry, 30 seconds to provide their 
information, and a value of time (based on DOT and FAA guidance) of $45.00/hour for business 
51 
 travel, $31.50/hour for personal travel and a composite or “all purposes” value of $37.20/hour, 
TSA estimates these 10-year opportunity costs to total $64 million, discounted at 7%.  Figure 12 
shows the estimated 10-year opportunity costs for these passengers.

AIRCRAFT OPERATOR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE 
Aircraft operators would incur a variety of costs to comply with the proposed 
requirements of the LASP.  All covered aircraft operators would incur costs to develop or modify 
security programs and submit profile information to TSA, contract with TSA-approved auditors, 
and submit passenger information to TSA-approved watch list service providers.  Newly 
regulated aircraft operators would incur additional expenses associated with designating security 
52 
 coordinators and ensuring they meet specified training requirements, subjecting flight crews to 
STAs, and controlling access to weapons.  
Security Programs and Profiles 
Covered aircraft operators would be required to submit a profile containing several pieces 
of information and to develop and submit a security program for approval by TSA.  Examples of 
the information aircraft operators would submit include the name of the business and any other 
names under which it does business; the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the owners and 
officers; and, the designated Aircraft Operator Security Coordinator’s (AOSC) contact 
information.  TSA determined this information would be necessary in order to identify all the 
owners and operators of regulated large aircraft, particularly since less information is available 
about these operators through other government sources than is the case for commercial 
operators required by TSA to maintain security programs.  Figure 13 presents the estimated 10-
year costs for covered aircraft operators to develop and submit security programs and profiles.

Covered aircraft operators would fill out a form provided by TSA containing basic profile 
information and return that profile form to TSA.  After reviewing the profile, TSA would make 
53 
 available to the aircraft operator a template Large Aircraft Standard Security Program which the 
operator would have the option to either accept without modification or use as the basis of 
developing its own security program.  TSA assumed that nearly all covered operators would 
choose to adopt the template security program.  TSA estimated it would take newly regulated 
aircraft operators between 8 and 16 hours to review the template security program, assemble the 
requisite profile information, and send the requisite documents to TSA for review.  TSA assumed 
an average of 12 hours for its primary estimate. 
Operators currently regulated under any of the security programs the LASP would 
subsume would likewise be able to accept the template program without modification or request 
an amendment to their existing security programs.  Given the fact that these operators would 
already be familiar with the core subject matter of the security program and would only need to 
become familiar with the new requirements, TSA estimated it would take these operators 
between 2 and 6 hours to review the template security program and submit information to TSA. 
TSA would divide the newly regulated population among 5 geographic regions and 
would not require aircraft operators to submit security program and profile information until 
their geographic region had been officially implemented.  TSA would devote an anticipated four 
months for implementation activities per region, resulting in 60% of the newly regulated 
operators being implemented in the first year.  The remaining 40% would be covered in the 
beginning of the second year, followed by a sixth phase incorporating all of the operators already 
regulated by TSA.  Based on information from FAA’s 2006 Aerospace Forecast, TSA assumed 
this population would grow by 1.4% in subsequent years, resulting in new security program and 
profile submissions. 
54 
 To calculate costs for covered aircraft operators to review and submit security program 
and profile information, TSA multiplied the estimated hourly range by the number of affected 
operators per implementation period and an hourly wage of $62.43.  This wage, a weighted 
average of the fully loaded hourly wages in the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) 
2006 annual salary survey for Aviation Department Managers I (do not fly), Aviation 
Department Mangers II (do some flying), and Chief Pilots, reflects TSA’s estimate of the cost of 
compensation for AOSCs.  TSA chose these occupations based on previous interviews with 
NBAA in 2002 and input from TSA subject matter experts.  Figure 14 presents the estimated 10-
year costs in constant 2006 dollars for newly covered aircraft operators to develop and submit 
security programs and profile information to TSA.

This rule would label large aircraft security programs as sensitive security information 
(SSI).  TSA regulations governing the use of SSI would require aircraft operators to restrict 
disclosure of, and access to, their security programs to those with a need-to-know and to destroy 
them when they are no longer needed.  Neither the use of a safe or a crosscut shredder is 
required; rather, a locked drawer or cabinet is an acceptable means of complying with the 
requirement to secure SSI, and a normal paper shredder or manual destruction are acceptable 
means of destroying SSI documents. 
TSA requires that SSI be clearly identified with a protective marking at the top and a 
distribution limitation statement at the bottom of each page.  As noted in the regulatory 
evaluation accompanying the rule establishing TSA’s SSI requirements,21 these protective 
markings may be applied to electronic documents with just a few keystrokes.  It is TSA’s 
expectation that most, if not all, aircraft operator security programs will be created and 
maintained electronically.  If this is not the case, the SSI regulatory evaluation notes that rubber 
stamps or printable labels are inexpensive and widely available. 
                                                 
21 69 FR 28066 (May 18, 2004). 
56 
 Given these considerations, TSA determined that equipment costs associated with 
treating aircraft operator security programs as SSI would be insubstantial.  Compliance with SSI 
provisions would likely be the responsibility of the aircraft operator security coordinator (AOSC) 
and are included in the costs associated with the AOSC’s duties discussed below. 
Security Coordinator Duties and Training 
Newly regulated large aircraft operators would be required to designate Aircraft Operator 
Security Coordinators (AOSC), Ground Security Coordinators (GSC), and In-Flight Security 
Coordinators (ISC) and ensure they are properly trained.  Each security coordinator position 
would have unique responsibilities; however, aircraft operator employees could be trained to 
serve as one or all three of these positions.  For example, the pilot-in-command would be 
required to serve as the ISC, but this individual could also serve as another of the security 
coordinators for any given flight.  The AOSC serves as TSA’s primary contact and is responsible 
for ensuring that the other security coordinators are properly trained.  The following discussion 
details the costs associated with security coordinator duties and training; Figure 16 presents the 
estimated 10-year costs.

 The principal AOSC or an alternate, if applicable, must be available for contact by TSA 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week to ensure the Agency is able to quickly disseminate any 
intelligence of a threat to a specific aircraft operator or industry segment.  The AOSC bears the 
further responsibility for maintaining any and all records necessary to demonstrate to an auditor 
or TSA inspector the aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program.  In addition to 
these AOSC duties, security coordinators are responsible for the enforcement of policies and 
procedures relative to the security of the aircraft, including the vetting of crew (where required) 
and passengers which must be carried out in accordance with the operator’s security program.  
Many of the aircraft operator requirements discussed in the following cost sections fall under the 
responsibility of the security coordinators.   
The most significant costs associated with the proposed rule are those caused by the 
fulfillment of the security coordinator duties, since these monitoring and verification activities 
would take place before every flight subject to the new regulation.  TSA subject matter experts 
have estimated that the time security coordinators of newly regulated aircraft operators would 
spend on their duties would likely average out to approximately 18 minutes per flight.  This 
estimate is based on 6 minutes for a security coordinator to verify all passenger information had 
been provided to the aircraft operator’s watch list service provider and, if necessary, to collect 
and submit information for any new passengers.  Security coordinators would require an 
estimated additional 12 minutes to inspect passengers and accessible property prior to boarding 
of the aircraft.  TSA determined security coordinators of aircraft operators already having a TSA 
security program would not see an incremental increase in the time required to perform their 
duties. 
58 
 Since these 18 minutes and the costs associated with them would be incurred for every 
flight by operators affected by the new rule, the estimate of annual flight operations is central to 
the cost estimates.  As noted above, information and data about the flight operations covered 
under the new rule can be sketchy, so TSA has used two approaches for estimating these annual 
flights.  The two methods lead to different results, so these approaches will be used to define the 
low and high estimates for the costs associated with the fulfillment of aircraft operator security 
coordinator duties.  The primary estimate will be the average of the two results. 
The first approach relies on data regarding actual flight operations by these operators.  
The underlying raw data for this effort is the DOT's Enhanced Traffic Management System 
database (ETMS), which collects records of all in flight interactions between the Instrument 
Flight Rules radar system providing surveillance in controlled airspace, from which individual 
flights can be identified by tail number in the database.  FAA has used this database along with 
data on operator fleets and aircraft ownership to identify and categorize annual flight activity 
across an extensive vector of parameters.22   
With this FAA database, it is possible to identify nearly all flights by general aviation 
operators (using FAR Part 91) as well as fractional operators (which operate under FAR Part 91 
SubPart K),  by aircraft type, aircraft size and engine type.  Charter operators flying as non-
scheduled Part 135 flights were also categorized.  All flights in aircraft 12,501 pounds or greater 
in FY2007 by these users were identified, creating a FY2007 flight count for operators subject to 
the new regulation. 
To develop estimates for future annual flight activity, the FAA forecasts for growth rates 
for GA activity by jet (6% a year), turboprop (0.6% a year) and piston (-0.2% a year) were 
                                                 
22 For a fuller discussion of the database and the flight identification methods used, see the information on database 
development under “Background” at http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/reauthorization/ 
59 
 applied to the FY2007 flight totals (by engine type).23  In 2007 there were two million such 
flights, and, using the mix of engine types making those flights and the associated growth rates, 
TSA estimates there will be 2.1 million such flights in 2008, with continued growth. 
Since these duties could be performed by any of the security coordinators, TSA used a 
wage of $53.59, which is a weighted average of wages from the NBAA Salary Survey reported 
for occupations that could likely serve as security coordinators.24  To estimate the annual costs of 
aircraft operator security coordinator duties using this flight count approach, the cost was 
calculated by multiplying 18 minutes by the annual flight totals and the annual wage rate of 
$53.59.  Annual cost estimates for the fulfillment of aircraft operator security coordinator duties 
are reported as part of Figure 17 below. 
For the second approach, TSA subject matter experts estimated operators that would be 
newly regulated by the proposed rule operate an average of 1.5 to 3.7 flights per day.  
Multiplying the number of flights per day by 365 days per year by the midpoint of this range – 
2.6 flights per day -- and the estimated security coordinator time per flight yields an annual total 
of 284 hours per operator for security coordinator duties.  Since these duties could be performed 
by any of the security coordinators, TSA used a wage of $53.59, which is a weighted average of 
wages from the NBAA Salary Survey reported for occupations that could likely serve as security 
coordinators.25

 For its primary estimate of this major cost component, TSA adopted the average from 
these two alternative approaches.  Figure 17 presents the estimated 10-year costs to newly 
regulated aircraft operators for security coordinator duties.

Newly regulated aircraft operators would also need to ensure that security coordinators 
undergo appropriate security training in order to carry out the required functions.  The AOSC 
would ensure GSCs and ISCs receive training.  Training would cover topics such as procedures 
to notify authorities when dealing with suspect items, unauthorized access to the aircraft, threat 
notification and response, implementation of security directives and other security related topics.  
Security coordinators would be required to complete both an initial training course and annual 
recurring training.  Based on the experience of operators currently conducting security 
coordinator training using TSA training module on TSA’s WebBoard, TSA estimated initial 
training courses would average 2 hours each for the GSC and ISC modules.  Recurring training 
would also be comprised of two discrete modules and would average 1 hour each. 
Recognizing that some aircraft operators have very small flight departments, TSA 
currently permits aircraft operator designated security coordinators to be cross-trained to perform 
61 
 the duties of any of the three security coordinators.  A person may not serve as more than two of 
these security coordinators for a given flight, however.  Thus, based on its experience with 
currently regulated operators, TSA anticipated that all security coordinators of newly regulated 
aircraft operators would be trained to serve as both the ISC and GSC.  Accordingly, all trained 
security coordinators would complete 4 hours of initial training (2 modules at 2 hours each) and 
2 hours of annual recurring training (2 modules at 1 hour each). 
The number of ISCs and GSCs aircraft operators would designate would vary based on 
the size of their flight departments.  Some aircraft operators may only have two security 
coordinators: the AOSC and someone trained to serve as both the ISC and GSC.  Larger flight 
departments, however, may have several security coordinators.  Based on its review of the 
industry, TSA determined that most affected flight departments would be small.  Consequently, 
for the purposes of its estimates, TSA assumed for its low, primary, and high scenarios that 
aircraft operators would train 1, 2, or 3 individuals, respectively, to serve as ISCs and GSCs.  
TSA multiplied this range by the number of new operators to arrive at the number of initial ISCs 
and GSCs requiring training.  TSA then applied a growth factor of 1.4% to account for new 
operators entering the industry and a turnover rate of 15% to reflect movement of employees into 
and within the industry. 
Figure 18 presents the estimated 10-year costs for initial ISC and GSC training.

AOSCs would incur costs to provide the training to GSCs and ISCs.  TSA assumed 
AOSCs would take advantage of group training sessions whenever possible.  Thus, during the 
implementation phase, TSA assumed AOSCs would train initial security coordinators as a group.  
Subsequent to this first training (Years 1 and 2), AOSCs would have to provide initial training to 
newly hired GSCs or ISCs individually.  TSA projected turnover to begin in Year 1, while 
growth does not begin until Year 2.  Figure 19 presents the estimated 10-year costs for AOSCs to 
provide initial ISC and GSC training.

As would be the case for initial training, AOSCs would have to provide recurring training 
to ISCs and GSCs.  To make efficient use of their resources, TSA assumed aircraft operators 
would have their AOSCs provide recurrent training to their ISCs and GSCs in a group.  Thus, 
regardless of whether an aircraft operator had 1 or 3 GSCs and ISCs, the AOSC would only 
expend 2 hours of time to provide training.  Figure 21 below presents the estimated 10-year costs 
for AOSCs to provide recurring training.

 Security Threat Assessments for Flight Crews 
Subpart G of part 1544 would require newly regulated aircraft operators to ensure that 
their flight crews are subject to criminal history records checks (CHRC) and checks against 
government terrorism watch lists and related databases.  TSA refers to these checks collectively 
as a security threat assessment (STA).  Existing operators are currently subject to the CHRC 
requirement under §1544.230.  The proposed rule would remove the requirement that currently 
regulated operators comply with §1544.230 and would instead require all large aircraft operators 
to conduct STAs on their flight crews under new part 1544, subpart G. 
In addition to this change, TSA is proposing to limit the validity of an STA to 5 years in 
order to align the valid life of the STA with the duration the FBI has set for the validity of the 
component CHRC.  TSA is also proposing to recover a fee of $74 to process each STA.   
As a result, both new and existing operators would incur costs to comply with the 
proposed requirements.  Figure 22 presents the total estimated 10-year cost of compliance for 
covered aircraft operators.

 As stated above, TSA is proposing to collect a fee of $74 to conduct a full STA for each 
flight crewmember of newly regulated aircraft operators.  An explanation of how TSA derived 
this fee can be found in the rule preamble.  In addition to the fee, applicants would experience 
opportunity costs to complete the STA application process, which requires each flight 
crewmember to submit fingerprints, along with information such as name, mailing and 
residential addresses, date and place of birth, Social Security Number (voluntary), immigration 
status, and other information necessary for TSA to determine whether an applicant has 
committed a disqualifying crime or may be linked to terrorism.  Law enforcement officers would 
also experience opportunity costs to provide fingerprinting services.  TSA has determined in 
previous analyses that the STA application and fingerprinting processes take about 30 minutes of 
applicant time and 10 minutes of law enforcement time.  Using an average wage rate of $51.40 
for aircraft operator flight crews,26 30 minutes represents an opportunity cost of $25.70 per STA.  
Similarly, 10 minutes of law enforcement time at an average wage rate of $26.1827 results in an 
opportunity cost of $4.36 per STA.  Combined, the total STA unit cost, inclusive of opportunity 
costs, would be $104.06. 
Since TSA did not have estimates of the number of flight crewmembers that would be 
affected by this requirement, TSA subject matter experts estimated that, on average, Part 91 
operators have 2 crewmembers per aircraft and 1.8 aircraft per operator, which, when applied to 
the 9,000 estimated Part 91 operators, yielded a total of 32,400 crewmembers that would need to 
complete a STA.  Similarly, TSA subject matter experts estimated Part 125 operators also have 
                                                 
26 The flight crew wage reported here is a weighted average of the following occupations from the 2006 NBAA 
Salary Survey: Aviation Department Manager II (does some flying), Chief Pilot, Senior Captain, and Copilot. 
27 Using BLS online database hourly wages , the 33-xxxx SOCs were used to estimate a weighted average hourly 
wage which was then adjusted for benefits by dividing by 0.682 which represents 31.8% of total compensation as 
benefits from the employer costs data  on the DOL website.  This fully-loaded 2005 wage was then inflated to 2006 
using the Employer Compensation Index.  (“May 2005 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates, 
Employment and wage estimates by occupation at the national level are divided into twenty-two tables, one for each 
SOC major group. National OES estimates by SOC major groups.”) 
66 
 an average of 2 crewmembers per aircraft but utilize 4 aircraft per operator.  When applied to the 
estimated 61 Part 125 operators, this yielded a total of an additional 488 crewmembers requiring 
STAs during the initial implementation phase. 
Once this starting population had been estimated, adjustments had to be made to reflect 
the anticipated implementation schedule and factors such as growth and turnover within the 
industry.  TSA anticipated it would implement 60% of the population (19,733 crewmembers) in 
the first year, and the remaining 40% (13,155) in the second.  As TSA implemented these 
identified operators, however, new operators would be entering the industry, and new employees 
would be hired.  To account for growth, TSA adopted the FAA’s forecast number of 1.4%.  TSA 
subject matter experts estimated annual employee turnover would average 15%.  Based on these 
inputs and accounting for renewal of STAs after 5 years, TSA estimated a number of STAs that 
would be processed over the first 10 years of the program.  Figure 23 presents these estimates 
and the associated 10-year costs for newly regulated aircraft operators to conduct STAs on flight 
crewmembers.

Existing aircraft operators currently conduct CHRCs on their flight crewmembers by 
submitting their information and fingerprints through the National Air Transportation 
67 
 Association (NATA) or the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE).  Aircraft 
operators choose one of these two entities and pay a fee of approximately $30 to $35.  This fee is 
paid directly to NATA and AAAE, and breaks down into two principal components: $12 for 
AAAE or NATA to process the applicant’s registration and submit the application to the 
government, and the FBI fee to process the fingerprints and conduct the CHRC.  Once 
completed, there is no TSA renewal requirement.  
TSA does not retain any money from the existing fee paid by operators currently 
regulated under the security programs that would be subsumed by the LASP.  In order to 
accommodate the substantial increase in population and the addition of the check against 
government watch lists and related databases, TSA is proposing to set up a new STA enrollment 
process and recover its costs through the proposed fee.  TSA would require currently regulated 
aircraft operators to submit STA rather than CHRC applications for their flight crews and to pay 
the new fee once the proposed rule became effective.  
TSA is also proposing to limit the validity of an STA to 5 years.  Flight crewmembers of 
currently regulated aircraft operators would thus be required to submit a new STA application 
upon publication of a final rule if their most recent CHRC had been completed 5 or more years 
prior to the compliance date of the final rule.  Flight crewmembers having CHRCs completed 
within 5 years prior to the compliance date in a final rule would be required to submit a STA 
application once 5 years had passed since the issuance of their current CHRC. 
TSA thus distinguished between flight crewmembers joining the industry due to growth 
and turnover and those obtaining STAs due to the 5-year renewal requirement in order to 
estimate compliance costs for existing aircraft operators.  Since employees joining the industry 
due to growth and turnover would already be subject to a CHRC under existing regulations, 
68 
 assessing the full proposed fee would overestimate the impact of the regulation.  To arrive at an 
adjusted fee, TSA subtracted from the proposed fee the estimated range of fees aircraft operators 
currently pay for CHRCs, as these costs are included in TSA’s proposed fee.  This yielded an 
adjusted fee of $39 to $44 ($74 less the $30 to $35 currently paid by aircraft operators).  TSA 
next omitted the opportunity costs estimated for the newly regulated population, because the 
information used for checks against government terrorism databases is a subset of the 
information already collected for CHRCs.  These opportunity costs were previously accounted 
for in the Twelve-Five and Private Charter rulemakings.  Thus, TSA estimated existing aircraft 
operators would incur an incremental unit cost of between $39 and $44 to conduct STAs on 
newly hired flight crewmembers, adopting the average of $41.50 as its primary estimate.  Figure 
24 presents the estimated 10-year costs.

TSA applied the unit STA of $104.06 used above for newly regulated operators to 
estimate the cost for existing operators to comply with the 5-year expiration of existing CHRCs 
and subsequent STAs.  TSA calculated the number of renewals based on input from TSA subject 
matter experts and data from AAAE.  Aircraft operators began conducting CHRCs on flight 
crews under the Twelve-Five and Private Charter programs beginning in 2003; thus, there would 
69 
 be a surge of STA applications for existing operator flight crews in the first years of the LASP, 
and a smaller spike in the 6th year as those STAs expired.  TSA based its projections on the 
assumption of 15% employee turnover and 1.4% industry growth used elsewhere in this 
evaluation.  Figure 25 presents the estimated 10-year costs for existing aircraft operators to 
comply with the requirement to renew flight crewmembers’ STAs after 5 years.

Control Access to Weapons 
Section 1544.202 currently applies to operations under the Full and Twelve-Five all-
cargo programs (TFSSP-AC, FACAOSSP).  Although the TFSSP-AC would be subsumed by 
the LASP, this section would continue to apply to the same population.  Presently, these 
operators are required to “apply the security measures in its security program for persons who 
board the aircraft for transportation, and for their property, to prevent or deter the carriage of any 
unauthorized persons, and any unauthorized weapons, explosives, incendiaries, and other 
destructive devices, items, or substances.”28  The proposed rule modifies Section 1544.202 by 
inserting between “unauthorized weapons” the words “or accessible.”  TSA has determined this 
requirement would have an insignificant impact, because few passengers are carried aboard such 
flights and operators are already required to screen them.  Further, operators would have a 
                                                 
28 49 CFR 1544.202. 
70 
 variety of means of rendering weapons inaccessible to passengers.  For example, operators may 
place weapons in the cargo hold, if available, or in a locked box the key of which is retained by 
the ISC for the duration of the flight.  TSA estimates these boxes cost about $100 and can be 
moved between aircraft as needed.  Alternatively, trigger locks may be used as long as the key is 
retained by the ISC for the duration of the flight. 
Persons and Property onboard a Large Aircraft 
The proposed rule adds a new Section 1544.206, which would require aircraft operators 
to prevent or deter the carriage of unauthorized persons and property on board a large aircraft.  
Property, for this section, is defined as any container, cargo, or company material that may be 
used to hide a stowaway or unauthorized materials such as explosives, incendiaries or other 
destructive substances or items.  If the property is stowed in a cargo hold that would not allow 
access to the cabin, then that property would be exempted from inspection.  TSA is unable to 
divulge further details about this inspection process because they would be part of the aircraft 
operator’s security program and are therefore SSI.  As noted in the discussion of Section 
1544.202, aircraft operators using aircraft without a cargo hold may render transported weapons 
inaccessible by placing them in a locked container under the ISC’s control. 
While this section would apply to all operations in large aircraft, the requirements of this 
section would be superseded by those in Sections 1544.202 and 1544.205 for all-cargo 
operations conducted under proposed 1544.103(d) (the FACAOSSP) or 1544.103(f)(2) 
(presently, the TFSSP-AC).  In the case of operations for compensation or hire in an aircraft 
having a MTOW exceeding 100,309.3 pounds or having 61 or more passenger seats conducted 
under proposed 1544.103(f)(1) (presently, the PCSSP), the requirements in this section would be 
superseded by Section 1544.201.  Thus, this section would primarily affect operations of Part 91 
71 
 operators or those of Part 125 operators carrying company materials in which no waybill is 
tendered. 
Given these considerations, TSA subject matter experts have determined that in most 
cases affected operators already comply with the anticipated inspection requirements during the 
normal course of the pre-flight check.  Costs associated with this responsibility are thus captured 
in the security coordinator duties above. 
TSA is requesting comments, however, on how it should define “unauthorized weapons.”  
For example, since this section is anticipated to apply principally to private aircraft operators, in 
the NPRM TSA asks for comments on whether “unauthorized weapons” should be limited to 
guns and firearms in cases where the aircraft is not being used for compensation or hire, or 
should apply more broadly to all of the items on TSA’s prohibited items list (available at 
www.tsa.gov).  TSA also requests comments on whether different requirements should apply 
based on the size of the aircraft, such as aircraft over 100,309 pounds (45,500 kg).  Final 
determinations about these definitions may increase or decrease the cost of this requirement on 
covered aircraft operators. 
Acquiring Personal Information from Passengers 
 Aircraft operators currently gather information about future passengers, and specific data 
elements that may not currently be collected will be necessary for Watch List Matching purposes 
under the proposed rule.  Acquiring this additional data will impose opportunity costs on 
potential passengers who much provide this data and on the aircraft operators who must 
compensate their employees for the time spent collecting this data from passengers. 
  TSA has estimated the total time incurred by passengers on the aircraft subject to this 
regulation in the section of this regulatory evaluation devoted to passenger opportunity costs.  In 
that section it is estimated that the collection of additional passenger information requires 30 
seconds of additional time.  To estimate the cost to aircraft operators of this time expenditure, 
TSA used an hourly compensation rate of $15.00.  This rate of compensation is equal to the 
72 
 mean compensation rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Office and Administrative 
Support Staff.29  These aircraft operator costs are reported in Figure 26 and total $35.6 million 
(undiscounted) over the 10 year period in the primary estimate.

 Watch List Matching 
The proposed regulation would require each aircraft operator to request and obtain certain 
passenger information from every passenger on each flight operated by the aircraft operator and 
transmit the information to an entity approved by TSA to conduct watch list matching (watch list 
service provider).  Any changes to the passenger information prior to boarding would be required 
to be resent to the watch list service provider. 
TSA anticipates most, if not all, watch list service providers would offer a continuous 
vetting service to their subscribers.  Aircraft operators choosing to use this option would submit 
to their watch list service provider a “master passenger list” of all of their regular passengers 
containing specified information about each one and designating those persons for continuous 
vetting.  The watch list service provider would then continuously match those names against the 
watch list and would bear the responsibility for notifying the aircraft operator of any potential 
matches.  The aircraft operator would then only submit new passenger information if either the 
specified information changed for a previously identified passenger or if the aircraft operator 
needed to transport a passenger not previously identified to the service provider. 
The proposed rule specifies that the aircraft operator must obtain the full name of the 
passenger as it appears on a valid government-issued form of identification.  Additionally, the 
aircraft operator must request and send, if available, the passenger’s date of birth, gender, and 
redress number.  The redress number is a unique identifying number provided to individuals who 
have submitted an approved redress complaint to the Department of Homeland Security’s 
Traveler Redress Inquiry Program.30  The aircraft operator must also send passport information 
(passport number, country of issuance, expiration date, gender, place of birth and full name of 
                                                 
30 TSA chose these data elements based on its experience comparing information with the watch list and to facilitate 
an anticipated future transition to TSA’s pending Secure Flight system.  Secure Flight is an advanced computer 
system designed to conduct automated watch list comparisons.   
74 
 the passenger) if the operator has that information in its possession.  If an aircraft operator does 
not already have this information, however, it would not be required to request that information 
from passengers specifically for purposes of watch list matching.  In order for an aircraft 
operator to designate a passenger for continuous vetting, the aircraft operator must acquire all of 
the requested passenger information, with the exception of the redress number, and have the 
passenger sign a form consenting to the submission of his or her information for continuous 
matching. 
TSA is seeking comments on whether to require covered aircraft operators to provide a 
privacy notice to individuals prior to collecting their information for watch list matching 
purposes.  TSA requests comments on how a privacy notice could be provided in light of factors 
such as feasibility, cost, and the overall effectiveness of providing such notice. 
Upon submission of the passenger information by the aircraft operator to the watch list 
service provider, the provider would inform the aircraft operator of the results of the watch list 
matching.  The operator would not be permitted to allow a passenger aboard an aircraft until the 
operator received a watch list result from the service provider.  If the passenger were cleared to 
board the aircraft, the operator could then permit the passenger to board.  If the passenger is 
identified as a Selectee, the large aircraft operator may permit the passenger to board the aircraft.  
However, the aircraft operator would be required to comply with the procedures described in its 
security program pertaining to passengers identified as Selectees, including screening of the 
passenger and accessible property, if applicable and if warranted by security.  If the watch list 
service provider were to instruct the operator that a passenger should be denied boarding, 
however, the operator could not permit the passenger to board, unless explicitly authorized by 
TSA.  In this instance, the watch list service provider might instruct the operator to contact TSA 
75 
 for further resolution or information regarding the passenger.  The watch list service provider 
may also instruct the aircraft operator to contact TSA if the passenger data provided were 
insufficient for the service provider to distinguish a passenger from an individual on the watch 
list.  The operator would then contact TSA pursuant to the procedures set forth in its security 
program. 
If the operator were to send updated passenger information to the watch list service 
provider for a passenger for whom the provider had already transmitted a watch list result, the 
operator could not permit the passenger to board until the operator received updated instructions 
from the provider.  Any previous instruction regarding the passenger would be void and the 
operator would be required to comply with any updated instruction from the provider. 
Based on discussions with TSA subject matter experts, as well as discussion with several 
firms currently providing support services for general aviation aircraft operators, TSA has 
developed a common “profile” for these firms.   
Services:  Typically, firms providing flight support services to domestic general aviation 
aircraft operations offer both services directly related to aviation such as, flight plans, fuel stops, 
scheduling, data hosting and back-up, provision of alternate routings to avoid delays, fixed-base 
operations, aviation data logistics, and weather services, as well as travel-related services.  
Additionally, several firms also support currently regulated general aviation aircraft operators by 
providing the vetting of passengers against the TSA watch lists; in most cases this vetting is done 
on a continuous basis using highly automated processes.  These firms also provide flight support 
services to international general aviation aircraft operations and typically offer these services in 
addition to landing clearances, visa requests, and CBP APIS filings.  In many cases the operators 
76 
 and passengers of those operators utilize general aviation for both domestic and international 
travel.   
Customer Focus:  In all cases, these firms see themselves as an extension of the aircraft 
operators’ flight department and endeavor to be seen as a full-service provider.  In fact, in some 
cases, these firms are the de facto flight departments for a number of operators.  Firms often 
meet specifically articulated customer requirements such as, providing strong privacy protection 
and data safeguards, as well as holding proprietary information confidential.  An example of the 
former is the personal information of senior corporate executives, while an example of the latter 
are corporate travel plans which, if made public, could, in combination with other publicly 
available information, affect market psychology and the value of securities.  Corporate security 
departments are especially concerned with the level of information protection provided by these 
firms. 
Fee Structure:  These firms tend to bundle services together in a tiered fashion that 
allows operators to contract for a full package, choose among a few packages with different 
service offerings, or a single service.  In the majority of instances fees are not dependent upon 
the number of passengers; firms tend to price their offerings either on per flight fee or monthly 
fee per aircraft basis.  Often aircraft size enters the calculus. 
Customer Characteristics:  Among the aircraft supported by these firms are those 
manufactured by Gulfstream, Cessna Aircraft Company, Bombardier, Challenger, Airbus (A-
319, A-320, A-340), and Boeing (737, 767).  When in general aviation service, large aircraft 
generally require two crewmembers and carry an average of four to six passengers, while smaller 
aircraft generally often have only one crewmember and from two and four passengers.  The 
77 
 operators supported by these firms are those that are described under current regulations as 14 
CFR Part 91 and Part 125, which include fractional owners, business firms, and private owners. 
Business Processes:  These firms are typically well-invested in information technology; 
the aggressive application of these technologies is built into business processes.  Maintaining 
technical sophistication appears to be an overarching business strategy.  Most firms can expand 
processing from 25% to 50%; a few firms have identified the capability to increase capacity 
higher than this level, however, these are firms that are currently vetting passengers in support of 
operators required to do so under current regulations.  The firms TSA interviewed see IT costs 
and labor costs as flat and costs for licensing as variable in the relevant range.  Several have 
indicated that this development and implementation could be completed from one to four 
months; a few have indicated that development and implementation could take one to two weeks 
as with expansion, these are the same firms currently performing passenger vetting.  Many of 
these firms are publicly traded and have processes in place as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley 
compliance that are commensurate with their reliance on IT as a fundamental business process. 
In light of these characteristics, TSA believes that there are sufficient capabilities in the 
private sector to fully support the watch list matching envisioned by this rule.  The following 
discussion identified individual components in the cost for these firms to support watch list 
matching.  Ramp-up and operating costs:  As discussed above, the TSA review of input from 
subject matter experts and firms currently providing similar services suggests that these firms are 
technologically sophisticated with more emphasis on capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive 
processes.  While the firms TSA interviewed believed increased transaction volume could be 
easily accommodated with little or no cost, TSA has developed a set of costs to stand as a proxy 
for ramp-up and operating costs. 
78 
 To provide an overall system estimate for these costs, TSA set the number of firms 
participating as Watch List Service Providers at a low of 10 firms, a midpoint of 20 firms, and a 
high of 30 firms.  This yields estimated total 10-year undiscounted costs of $45.6 million for the 
primary estimate. 
FISMA-related costs:  TSA subject matter estimates have indicated that firms providing 
watch list matching services would not be subject to FISMA compliance given that they are not 
operating a system for TSA.  Rather, these firms would be maintaining their own systems that 
utilize the TSA-provided watch lists and performing that service for the aircraft operators.  This 
is not unlike current business relationships that enable the regulated general aviation operators to 
perform watch list matching.  Many operators contract with third parties for this watch list 
matching.  The operator and the service provider enter into a non-disclosure agreement whereby 
operators allow the service providers to access the watch lists on their behalf.  Firms match the 
operator’s flight manifest using software and copies of the lists resident on their internal systems 
and return passenger status to the operator.  Additionally, TSA subject matter experts see the 
process in place to assure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley as adequate to the task of evaluating 
information systems. 
For the purposes of this analysis, TSA has elected to include costs for FISMA 
compliance to maintain visibility of this issue.  TSA estimates that the 10-year undiscounted 
costs to one Watch List Service Provider are $80,000.  There would be associated TSA audit 
costs of $150,000 per Watch List Service Provider, which are reported in Figure 49 below.  
Based on research and conclusions reached by subject matter experts, TSA set the 
number of firms participating as Watch List Service Providers at a low estimate of 10 firms, a of 
primary estimate of 20 firms, and a high estimate of 30 firms.  This yields estimated total 10-year 
79 
 undiscounted FISMA and audit costs of $4.6 million for the Primary estimate, which includes the 
service provider FISMA costs reported in and the TSA audit costs reported in Figure 49. 
As discussed above, the characteristics of the customer-supplier chain suggests that the 
importance of confidentiality and privacy is critical feature of the business process; TSA believes 
that many of the processes (and benchmarks) established by FISMA and Sarbanes-Oxley are 
already in place for the firms that are the most likely candidates to become third-party Watch 
List Service Providers. 
To estimate the cost incurred by aircraft operators TSA includes an overhead and a profit 
rate as part of the cost of audits.  An overhead rate of 12 percent is applied from OMB Circular 
A-76 (May 29, 2003) to cover the ongoing operating expenses that an auditor is expected to add.  
In addition, a profit rate of 10 percent is applied using guidance from the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation 15.404-4 (2005 Reissue).   
The costs for Watch List Service Providers described above are summarized in Figures 
26 and 27.  TSA has estimated the primary 10 year cost of providing watch list matching by this 
industry segment at $31.8 million discounted at 7% and a total of $45.6 million undiscounted.  
For these firms, the key undiscounted cost categories included are ramp-up costs of $63,000 per 
firm, refresh costs of $124,000 per firm, annual operating costs of $127,000 and a one-time 
FISMA costs of $80,000.

The proposed watch list requirement serves the dual purpose of limiting and controlling 
the distribution of the watch list while providing a regulatory structure for a practice that has 
already developed in industry. 
With respect to the existing aircraft operators, aircraft operators presently subject to TSA 
security programs must compare passenger names to the No Fly and Selectee Lists  portion of 
the watch list prior to each covered flight.  While some operators perform this comparison 
81 
 manually, TSA subject matter experts have determined that a number of firms that currently 
provide flight planning and filing services have also adopted the role of the proposed watch list 
service providers.  To the extent that existing aircraft operators are presently utilizing these 
service providers, the proposed requirement may represent little change.  TSA subject matter 
experts were unable to quantify how these changes might affect currently regulated aircraft 
operators.  To enable TSA to quantify this impact, the Agency requests detailed comments from 
currently regulated aircraft operators on how the proposed changes to the watch list matching 
process would impact their operations. 
With respect to newly regulated aircraft operators, given that these operators tend to serve 
a specific set of passengers, and to the degree that they already have established relationships 
with flight planning firms that might become approved watch list service providers, the costs 
associated with bundling continuous vetting services together with other flight-related service 
offerings could be minimal.  TSA has included an estimate of 6 minutes per flight in the security 
coordinator duties above to account for the estimated time necessary for newly regulated 
operators to collect passenger information and review manifests to ensure information for all 
passengers has been provided to the service provider and a watch list result received permitting 
each person to board.  To enable TSA to quantify this impact, the Agency requests detailed 
comments from newly regulated aircraft operators on how the proposed changes to the watch list 
matching process would impact their operations. 
Aircraft operators that provide their own flight planning and filing and do not rely on a 
third-party for flight-related services, however, may face a different cost structure than operators 
already subscribing to such services, potentially disadvantaging smaller operators.  TSA did not 
have information on either the number of covered operators that currently do not utilize a flight-
82 
 planning service.  TSA requests detailed comments from industry, supported by data, to enable 
the Agency to quantify the impact of this proposal.   
TSA also requests comments on how TSA’s proposal to require covered aircraft 
operators to use watch list service providers may affect the prevailing industry structure and 
prices. 
 
TSA is also aware that certain flights that would be covered by the proposed LASP are 
also covered by US Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) regulations requiring submission of 
passenger information to its Advance Passenger Information System (APIS).  This system also 
compares passenger information to government watch lists for specific categories of flights to 
and from the U.S.  Presently, CBP only compares to the watch lists passenger manifests for 
commercial flights to or from the U.S. 32  CBP has published its own NPRM extending its APIS 
regulations to private aircraft flying to or from the U.S. 33  Should CBP’s proposed rule become 
final, all private aircraft flying to or from the U.S., regardless of size, would be required to 
submit their passenger manifests to DHS for comparison to the watch lists. 
To avoid process redundancies, DHS would require operators and pilots of private large 
aircraft that would be subject to both TSA’s proposed rule and CBP’s proposed private aircraft 
regulations to submit their passenger manifest to CBP only and not to their watch list service 
providers.  TSA would deem U.S. operators of private large aircraft to be in compliance with the 
requirements to submit passenger information for watch list matching purposes under this 
proposed rule for international flights if the pilot submits passenger information required under 
                                                 
32 19 CFR 122.1(d) defines “commercial aircraft” as any aircraft transporting passengers and/or cargo for some 
payment or other consideration, including money or services rendered. 
33 19 CFR 122.1(h) also defines a private aircraft as any aircraft leaving the United States carrying neither 
passengers nor cargo in order to lade passengers and/or cargo in a foreign area for commercial purposes; or 
returning to the United States carrying neither passengers nor cargo in ballast after leaving with passengers and/or 
cargo for commercial purposes. 
83 
 the proposed eAPIS regulations.  TSA requests comments on the number of operators and flights 
that would be subject to both the LASP and APIS watch list matching requirements. 
Audits of Aircraft Operators 
Under the proposed rule, each aircraft operator must contract with an auditor approved by 
TSA to conduct an audit of the aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program. 
Each aircraft operator must undergo an initial audit to be conducted within 60 days of the 
approval of the aircraft operator’s security program.  Thereafter, each aircraft operator must 
undergo a subsequent audit within 24 months of the aircraft operator’s last audit.  Figure 28 
presents the estimated 10-year costs for all aircraft operators to complete audits; these costs are 
discussed further and divided between currently and newly regulated aircraft operators below.

Auditors would be provided access to all records, equipment, and facilities necessary for 
the auditor to conduct an audit of the aircraft operator’s security program.  The audit report 
would include information about the audit process and the auditor’s findings and conclusions of 
the audit.  Both the aircraft operator and TSA would receive a copy of the audit report from the 
auditor, and the aircraft operator may submit written comments on the report to TSA within 30 
84 
 days of receiving its copy.  The audit report would be an important tool in TSA’s compliance 
program by enabling TSA to evaluate a large aircraft operator’s compliance with TSA 
regulations and its security program and to ascertain if additional TSA action would be required. 
Based on similar audits undertaken relative to other federal aviation programs, TSA 
estimates these cost for these audits to be approximately $1,850 per audit, on average.  Currently, 
audits are performed to review, safety, operations and maintenance.  TSA anticipates that many 
of these firms will offer the “security” audit as part of their offerings to their current customers 
and, perhaps, where feasible, bundle the security audit with already scheduled audits. 
Based on interviews with 3 International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-
BAO) auditors, TSA subject matter experts estimated costs for audits could range from $1,200 to 
$2,500.  The low estimate assumes the security audit would be performed as part of a required 
FAA safety audit, requiring 8 hours of auditor time at $150 per hour.  These are standard rates 
for ISBAO safety checks that currently apply.  The 8 hours includes both the time to review the 
necessary documents and to write up the audit report.  The high estimate assumes the same 
auditor time and wage rate, but adds on $1,300 to account for auditor travel expenses to make a 
special visit to the aircraft operator.   
To estimate the cost incurred by aircraft operators TSA includes an overhead and a profit 
rate to the cost of audits.  An overhead rate of 12 percent is applied from OMB Circular A-76 
(May 29, 2003) to cover the ongoing operating expenses that an auditor is expected to add.  In 
addition, a profit rate of 10 percent is applied using guidance from the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation 15.404-4 (2005 Reissue).  Applying both of these factors to the estimated audit cost 
of $1,850 increases the cost to aircraft operators to $2,257 per audit.   
85 
 TSA assumed 50% of newly regulated aircraft operators would have to undergo audits in 
the first year and the remaining operators would pay for audits in the second year.  Audit costs 
would then recur for each population every 2 years.  Figure 29 presents the estimated 10-year 
cost to newly regulated aircraft operators for TSA audits.

Operators currently operating under a TSA security program would not be implemented 
until the second year.  As above, the proposed rule would require these operators to complete an 
audit within 60 days of submitting their security program to TSA and then again every 24 
months.  Figure 30 presents the estimated 10-year costs for currently regulated aircraft operators 
to undergo audits.  Operators in the odd-numbered years are a product of the assumed 1.4% 
growth within the industry.

As already stated, these costs are based on an assumption that TSA-approved auditors 
would charge prices comparable to those currently charged by FAA safety inspectors.  TSA 
requests comments on this assumption, however, including comments on how this requirement 
may affect the prevailing industry structure and prices. 
Other Requirements of 49 CFR Part 1544 
TSA has determined that the sections identified below would have a de minimis impact 
on covered aircraft operators.  These sections correspond to those identified in Figure 4 as “new 
requirements” and not discussed separately in the aircraft operator costs of compliance.  The 
following paragraphs provide a brief description of each requirement and the basis for TSA’s 
determination.  TSA welcomes comments, supported by data, on its assumptions and findings. 
Law Enforcement Personnel 
This section forms part of the basic TFSSP; it would thus be a new requirement only for 
newly regulated operators.  To meet the requirements of this section, newly regulated aircraft 
operators would need to establish and maintain procedures for contacting local law enforcement 
in order to respond to an incident.  TSA’s regulations governing airports, 49 CFR part 1542, 
require airports to establish agreements with local law enforcement to respond to such incidents.  
87 
 Thus, when flying into an airport with a TSA security program, the aircraft operator need only 
coordinate with the airport security coordinator (ASC) and TSA to meet this requirement.  When 
flying into an airport not having a TSA security program, the aircraft operator may meet this 
requirement by knowing how to contact local law enforcement.  TSA thus determined this 
section would have a minimal impact on aircraft operators and that the estimated security 
coordinator duties likely capture any incremental burden. 
Carriage of Accessible Weapons 
This section forms part of the basic TFSSP; it would thus be a new requirement only for 
newly regulated operators.  This requirement sets forth procedures an aircraft operator must 
follow in circumstances where a law enforcement officer (LEO) has a need to travel armed 
aboard an aircraft.  Aside from ensuring security coordinators are familiar with the stated 
procedures, the requirements of this section should not have an impact on covered aircraft 
operators.  TSA has elsewhere estimated costs associated with security coordinator training. 
Transportation of Federal Air Marshals 
This section forms part of the basic TFSSP; it would thus be a new requirement only for 
newly regulated operators.  This section specifies that a covered aircraft operator must transport 
Federal Air Marshals upon receiving prior notification from TSA.  The Agency does not 
anticipate this requirement would be invoked in the instance of newly regulated aircraft operators 
except in exigent circumstances.  TSA thus was unable to predict the frequency with which 
aircraft operators might be affected by this requirement but anticipated that any impact would be 
minimal. 
88 
 Security of Aircraft and Facilities 
This would be a new requirement for all large aircraft operators, with the exception of 
those currently operating under the PCSSP.  This section would require covered aircraft 
operators to use the facilities, procedures, and equipment described in their security programs to 
prevent unauthorized access to areas and aircraft controlled by the aircraft operator.  If access to 
the aircraft were not controlled, the aircraft operator would be required to conduct a full security 
inspection of the aircraft before placing it into passenger operations.  TSA subject matter experts 
stated this requirement aligns with common industry practice and should not represent a cost 
impact to aircraft operators. 
Volunteer Emergency Services 
This section would be a new requirement for all large aircraft operators covered by the 
proposed rule.  The NPRM would also formally add this requirement to the AOSSP and 
FACAOSSP, though TSA has already implemented the substance of this requirement in the 
AOSSP.  TSA is proposing this requirement in response to Congressional legislation directing 
the Agency to establish a program limiting liability for qualified LEOs, firefighters, and 
emergency medical technicians (EMT) who provide their services in an emergency situation.  As 
proposed, aircraft operators would be required to establish a program whereby LEOs, 
firefighters, and EMTs may present their credentials to the aircraft operator prior to boarding an 
aircraft and consent to be called upon in case of an emergency.  By presenting their credentials 
and volunteering their services, these three classes of emergency response personnel would be 
exempted from liability for any damages brought in a Federal or State court arising from their 
emergency service efforts, except in cases of negligence or willful misconduct.  TSA determined 
that since the requirements of this proposed section are largely procedural, they would likely not 
89 
 have any substantive impact on an aircraft operator beyond the already estimated time to develop 
security programs and train aircraft operator security coordinators. 
Contingency Plan 
This section forms part of the basic TFSSP; it would thus be a new requirement only for 
newly regulated operators.  Operators would be required to adopt a contingency plan as a part of 
their security programs and put it into effect when directed by TSA.  TSA views adoption of a 
contingency plan as a procedural requirement with minimal cost and determined that any cost 
associated with formulating and implementing the plan should be included in the estimated cost 
to develop security programs. 
Bomb or Air Piracy Threats 
This section forms part of the basic TFSSP; it would thus be a new requirement only for 
newly regulated operators.  This section sets forth specific procedures with which an aircraft 
operator must comply upon receipt of a specific and credible threat to the security of a flight, an 
aircraft, or a ground facility.  In cases of a threat to a flight, the aircraft operator must 
immediately notify the GSC, ISC, and appropriate airport operator.  The ISC must in turn notify 
all flight crewmembers.  This notification requirement could be accomplished through air traffic 
control and would not require installation of any special equipment aboard the aircraft. 
In cases of threats against an aircraft, the aircraft operator must deplane any passengers 
and conduct a security inspection of the aircraft.  If a credible threat is made against a ground 
facility at an airport, the aircraft operator must immediately notify the airport operator as well as 
all other aircraft operators at the threatened facility.  The aircraft operator must then conduct a 
security inspection. 
90 
 Because the number of threats which would cause this provision to come into force is 
unpredictable, TSA was not able to estimate a cost for this requirement.  We specifically request 
comment, including data, on this possible impact. 
Security Directives and Information Circulars 
This section forms part of the basic TFSSP; it would thus be a new requirement only for 
newly regulated operators.  TSA issues Information Circulars to aircraft operators when it 
receives information of a threat.  These notifications provide aircraft operators with relevant 
security information but do not require operator action.  If, however, TSA determines 
information about a threat requires an immediate operational response, the Agency issues a 
Security Directive.   
Upon receipt of a Security Directive, newly regulated aircraft operators would be 
required to verbally acknowledge to TSA their receipt of the direction.  The section would then 
require aircraft operators to either implement the procedures contained in the Security Directive 
within the specified timeframe or propose alternate security measures. 
Because both the types of actions that operators would be required to take when TSA 
notified them of a security threat and the frequency with which such threats would occur are 
unpredictable, TSA was not able to estimate a cost for this requirement.  We specifically request 
comment, including data, on this possible impact. 
AIRPORT OPERATOR COSTS OF COMPLIANCE 
Security Programs and Profiles 
The proposed rule would require certain categories of airports to develop a partial airport 
security program and submit a profile.  This requirement would apply to airports that do not 
presently have a security program and which regularly serve scheduled or public charter 
91 
 operations in large aircraft.  TSA estimated 42 airports would fall into this category.  The 
requirement would also apply to GA airports designated by the Secretary of Transportation as 
reliever airports.  TSA estimated this requirement would affect approximately 273 airports.  In 
sum, an estimated 315 airports would be affected. 
As would be the case for covered aircraft operators, TSA would make available a 
template partial airport security program which operators would have the option to either accept 
without modification or use as the basis of developing their own security program.  
Requirements of the partial airport security program include: designation of an airport security 
coordinator and provision of training, establishment of procedures for public advisories and 
incident management, and coordination with law enforcement personnel to support the security 
program. 
TSA assumed that nearly all covered operators would choose to adopt the template 
security program.  Once an airport operator had reviewed and implemented the security program 
requirements, it would submit to TSA a form acknowledging its compliance with the stated 
requirements.  This form would also include space for the required profile information.  TSA 
estimated it would take these newly regulated airport operators between 8 and 16 hours to review 
and implement the template security program and assemble the requisite profile information.  
TSA adopted an average of 12 hours as its primary estimate.   
TSA is also considering requiring airport operators to undertake a risk-based self-
assessment of their security programs.  TSA would provide the risk-assessment tool and requests 
comments on whether airport operators should be required to use this tool in developing their 
security programs.  For the purpose of this analysis, TSA assumed that, if provided, use of the 
92 
 self-assessment tool would be voluntary rather than mandatory and did not factor its use into the 
time required to develop the security program. 
TSA therefore multiplied the hour estimates above by the number of airport operators and 
a middle management wage rate of $31.24 per hour.  TSA assumed an annual turnover rate of 
1% resulting from changes in airport characteristics that would subject new airports to these 
requirements.  Figure 31 presents the total 10-year costs to airport operators to review security 
programs and submit profiles.

Airport operators would also be required to protect their security programs as SSI.  As 
discussed above under the aircraft operator security program costs, TSA did not anticipate this 
requirement would result in substantive incremental costs to regulated entities. 
Security Coordinator Duties and Training 
TSA regulations require airport security coordinators (ASC) to be available to TSA on a 
24-hour basis, 7 days a week.  In order to meet this requirement, it is typical for airports to 
designate between 1 and 3 ASCs.  These security coordinators are responsible for coordinating 
with TSA and ensuring the airport remains in compliance with the airport security program and 
any TSA Security Directives.  The ASC must also establish incident management procedures, 
93 
 including coordination with local law enforcement, and immediately initiate a response to any 
identified security threat or breach.  Additionally, Section 1542.3(c) stipulates that all ASCs must 
complete subject matter training in accordance with the airport operator’s security program.  
Figure 32 presents the estimated 10-year costs to airport operators for security coordinator duties 
and training.

TSA estimated airport security coordinators would spend an average of between 0.5 and 
1 hour per week on their duties, adopting 0.75 hours per week as its primary estimate.  To 
calculate costs associated with security coordinator duties, TSA multiplied the anticipated 
number of airports by the estimated annual hours and the ASC average hourly cost of 
compensation.  Although TSA assumed it would receive a number of new airport security 
programs each year amounting to 1% of the total number of airports, this would overestimate the 
number of airports with active security programs because some airports would no longer meet 
the criteria requiring them to have security programs.  To compensate for this fluctuation, TSA 
assumed the number of airports with active security programs, and thus ASCs on duty, would 
94 
 grow by 0.5% annually.  Figure 33 shows the estimated 10-year costs to airport operators for 
security coordinator duties.

TSA training requirements for airport security coordinators differ from those for aircraft 
operator security coordinators.  ASC training is only offered twice per year by the American 
Association of Airport Executives (AAAE).  This 8-hour training course is taught by 
professional trainers and requires payment of a $350 registration fee.  Since this training is 
offered at a single location, TSA estimated ASCs would need to expend an additional $450 to 
cover travel and other incidental expenses.  TSA assumed the need to travel to and from the 
training would effectively add an additional 8 hours to the training. 
Figure 34 presents the estimated costs to airport operators for ASC training time.  The 8 
hours of class time are added to the 8 hours of assumed travel time for a total of 16 hours of 
compensated ASC time.  As stated above, TSA estimated airports would need to train between 1 
and 3 ASCs in order to meet the requirements that an ASC be available 24-hours per day.  
Without more detailed information, TSA adopted the average of 2 for its primary estimate.  To 
calculate costs for ASCs needing training after the initial implementation, TSA used a growth 
rate of 1%, as noted above, to account for new airports adopting a partial airport security 
95 
 program.  TSA subject matter experts estimated that the turnover rate for ASCs is approximately 
30%.

TSA recognizes that in some cases these airports are owned and maintained by small 
municipalities, and funds for ASCs to attend training must be provided from the city budget.  
This may be a burden on some jurisdictions.  TSA is thus requesting comments on whether 
ASCs of airports operating under a partial airport security program should be required to undergo 
96 
 the same training as ASCs of airports operating under a Supporting or full Airport Security 
Program, as assumed in TSA’s calculations above, or if a shorter or otherwise modified training 
program would be appropriate. 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COSTS 
In addition to the costs to covered aircraft and airport operators, TSA would incur costs to 
reach out to covered operators during the implementation stage, to process security programs and 
profiles submitted by aircraft and airport operators, and to then conduct inspections to ensure that 
covered operators comply with their security programs.  Additionally, TSA would incur costs to 
process applications from individuals and firms requesting approval to become third party 
auditors or watch list service providers and then to oversee the approved applicants.  Each of 
these components is discussed in greater detail below.  TSA costs to process security programs 
and profiles and to enforce compliance are segmented according to whether they pertain to 
aircraft or airport operators. 
Processing of Security Programs and Profiles 
TSA would incur costs to process and review aircraft and airport operator security 
programs and profiles.  TSA is proposing to phase in operators in 6 phases spanning 24 months.  
While these costs are not significant, TSA provides a brief description of these in this section in 
the interest of transparency.  The total for this cost segment amounts to approximately $834,000 
over a ten year period; discounted at 3% and 7% this amounts to approximately $789,000 and 
$737,000, respectively.

Aircraft Operators 
TSA would address the processing of the security programs submitted by large aircraft 
operators using a phased approach.  In phases one through five, large aircraft operators which 
would be newly covered by security regulations would be processed.  The phases would be based 
on dividing the population geographically.  Phase six would be comprised of all aircraft 
operators that were covered under previous security regulations. 
A net growth rate of 1.4% was used for the large aircraft operator population, as 
published by the FAA, to develop costs beyond the initial phase-in period.

High $20,639 $330,221 $660,443 $1,011,303 
 
The low and high estimates are based on assuming differing estimates of the large aircraft 
operator population applied to the primary estimate of $809,000.  The low estimate is based on 
75% of the population underlying the primary estimate and amounts to approximately $607,000 
while the high estimate is based on 125% of the population underlying the primary estimate and 
amounts to approximately $1 million. 
For analytical purposes, the estimated total cost for the processing of security programs 
submitted by the operators of large aircraft has been divided into three cost components; these 
are:  initial contact, profile input, and review.  Each of these is discussed more fully below.   
Initial Contact Process.  Beyond the standard notification provided through the Federal 
Register, TSA intends to provide notification to the community of large aircraft operators 
through federally maintained web boards, as well as web boards maintained by industry 
associations.  This notification will request all large aircraft operators to provide TSA with 
operator specific information.  The cost for this component has been estimated at approximately 
$17,000 dollars and does not include the costs associated with the Federal Register. 
99 
 Profile Input Process.  The cost for this component is estimated at $264,000 dollars and 
covers the cost of reviewing and entering the information provided by the operator.  Following 
the review of these data TSA will notify operators of the dates within which they are to file their 
security program. 
Program Review Process.  The cost for this component is estimated at $528,000 dollars 
and covers the cost of reviewing and approving the security program submitted by each aircraft 
operator and entering the information provided by the large aircraft operators. 
Combining these processes yields a need for an estimated 17,000 hours over 10 years.

Airport Operators 
TSA would phase in airport operators in a manner similar to aircraft operators, with the 
exception that there would be only five implementation phases, as there are no existing airport 
operators that would be required to resubmit security programs under the proposed rule.  Figure 
39  presents the estimated 10-year costs for TSA to process airport operator security programs 
100 
 and profiles.  TSA assumed a net growth rate of 1% to estimate costs beyond the initial phase-in 
period.

The low and high estimates are based on assuming different rates for the airport operator 
growth rate.  The low estimate is based on 75% of the growth rate underlying the primary 
estimate, while the high estimate is based on 125% of the growth rate underlying the primary 
estimate.  As can be seen, these assumptions did not substantially affect the estimated costs. 
The description in the preceding section of TSA costs to contact aircraft operators and 
process security programs and profiles also would apply to airports.  Accordingly, Figure 40 
presents the estimated work hours and costs for each of these cost segments.

Compliance and Enforcement 
TSA would conduct inspections of operators covered by the proposed rule to ensure 
compliance with their applicable security program.  While TSA would use its own inspectors to 
examine airport operators, the Agency has determined that inspecting covered aircraft operators 
would exceed the Agency’s resources, given the large number and geographic dispersion of these 
operators.  As a result, TSA is proposing that aircraft operators contract with TSA-approved 
auditors on a biennial basis.  Based on these audit reports and random sampling, TSA would then 
send inspectors to conduct follow-up inspections.  The total for this cost segment would amount 
to approximately $190.0 million over a 10-year period.  Discounted at 3% and 7% this total 
would amount to approximately $162.1 million and $133.5 million, respectively.

Aircraft Operators 
As stated above, due to the large size and geographical locations of the aircraft operator 
population that would be subject to this proposed rule, TSA is proposing the use of TSA-
approved third-party auditors.  These TSA-approved third-party auditors would support existing 
TSA resources, in order to ensure compliance with TSA regulations and the aircraft operator’s 
security program.  Auditors would conduct audits of TSA regulated parties and submit their 
findings in the manner and form prescribed by TSA.  Auditors’ reports would assist TSA 
inspectors in the conduct of compliance inspections as necessary.  TSA would use the third-party 
auditors’ reports as one tool in establishing inspection and enforcement priorities.  TSA would 
require the auditors to have significant experience in regulatory and/or inspection processes.  
Figure 42 presents the estimated 10-year costs for TSA to manage the auditing process and 
conduct inspections of large aircraft operators.

High $2,480.3 $6,875.4 $5,638.1 $730.9 $3,144.9 $18,869.6
 
The associated low and high estimates were based on differing levels of the sampling rate 
used during the audit sampling process (discussed below).  The low estimate is based on 
employing 75% of the sampling rate underlying the primary estimate and amounts to 
approximately $13.4 million.  The high estimate is based on employing 125% of the sampling 
rate underlying the primary estimate and amounts to approximately $18.9 million. 
For analytical purposes, the estimated total cost for the third-party auditing of large 
aircraft operators has been divided into five cost components; these are:  audit review, audit 
sampling, inspection, return review, and program management.  Each of these is discussed more 
fully below.   
Audit Review.  As each third-party audit is received TSA analysts will review the 
submission for completeness and audit findings.  This review will essentially establish three 
groups those audits returned for deficiencies, those audits identified as complete and without 
findings, and those audits identified as completed and with findings.  For the purposes of this 
analysis, TSA assumes that no audits will be returned as deficient (i.e., 0% rework).  The 10-year 
cost for this component is estimated at $2.5 million. 
104 
 Audit Sampling.  Those audits identified as complete and without findings will be subject 
to 10% detection sample.  These randomly selected audits will be subject to a full inspection by 
TSA personnel.  These post-audit inspections provide TSA with an evaluation of the system’s 
performance while also identify auditors that may require additional training or remediation.  
The 10-year cost for this component is estimated at $4.6 million.   
Inspection.  Third-party auditors will have no authority to take enforcement action; all 
audits reports would be evaluated by TSA, and TSA inspectors would take any appropriate 
follow-up action.  Current TSA inspection experience indicates that approximately 10.8% of 
inspections lead to at least one finding that merits a second inspection to determine if the finding 
has been remedied.  This proportion was used to develop the cost for this cost component.  The 
10-year cost for this component is estimated at $5.6 million. 
Return Review.  Current TSA inspection experience indicates that the proportion of TSA 
inspections that require a third visitation is 1.4% of all inspections.  These inspections require a 
third inspection to determine if the finding was found unaddressed during the second inspection 
has been remedied; this proportion was used to develop the cost for this cost component.  The 
10-year cost for this component is estimated at $731,000. 
Program Management.  This cost component was set at 20% of program costs and 
amounted to $2.7 million over the 10-year period.

Airport Operators 
TSA would use its own inspectors to evaluate whether airport operators were complying 
with their security programs.  TSA inspectors would visit each airport required to have a security 
program under the LASP and conduct follow-up inspections, as necessary.  In addition to the 
duty time for inspectors to travel to airport locations and to conduct inspection activities, TSA 
would incur costs to pay for inspector travel expenses and provide administrative support.  
Figure 44 presents the total estimated 10-year costs for TSA to evaluate airport operator 
compliance.

For analytical purposes, the estimated total cost for inspection of airport operators has 
been divided into two cost components:  inspection and program management.  Each of these is 
discussed more fully below. 
Inspection.  Based on the number of airports that would be covered by the proposed rule 
and current TSA airport inspection schedules, TSA anticipated it would need to add 154 
individuals to its inspection staff in order to satisfactorily inspect each of the 315 airports that 
would be added under the proposed rule.  This would include new inspectors, supervisors, and 
headquarters support personnel.  TSA estimated it would require approximately $15.9 million 
annually for wages and benefits to maintain these new inspectors.  At the time of writing, a 
detailed inspection program had not yet been specified.  TSA will continue to evaluate these 
estimates as it determines its final inspection program, however, and will publish any revisions 
and relevant detail in the regulatory evaluation accompanying a final rule. 
Program Management.  TSA would be responsible for costs in addition to inspector time, 
including travel expenses such as meals and lodging and provision of administrative supplies and 
support.  TSA assumed this would amount to $1.4 million annually. 
107 
 Database Modifications.  To keep records of airport profiles, inspection reports, and any 
violations and enforcement actions, TSA would need to make modifications to its existing 
compliance database.  TSA has estimated that these modifications would require an investment 
of $450,000 in the first year of the program.  
Auditor Enrollment 
In this cost segment TSA will identify its costs associated with enrolling an individual as 
an authorized third-party auditor, as well as those costs associated with reviewing and 
confirming that individual’s status as she or he undertakes the biennial recertification process.  
This section does not include the cost of undertaking the security threat assessment required of 
all auditors. 
While these costs are not significant, TSA provides a brief description of these in this 
section in the interest of transparency.  The total for this costs segment amount to approximately 
$491,000 over a 10-year period; discounted at 3% and 7% this amounts to approximately 
$428,000 and $363,000 respectively.

High $24,541 $21,813 $35,505 $81,860 $415,000 $496,860
 
108 
 The low and high estimates are based on assuming differing estimates of the net auditor 
turn over rate.  In the case of the primary estimate, the net auditor turn over rate was assumed to 
be 5%.  The low estimate is based on 75% of the population underlying the primary estimate and 
amounts to approximately $484,000 while the high estimate is based on 125% of the population 
underlying the primary estimate and amounts to approximately $496,000. 
For analytical purposes, the estimated total cost for the auditor enrollment has been 
divided into four cost components; these are:  enrollment, initial training, recurring reapproval, 
and training course development and maintenance.  Each of these is discussed more fully below. 
Enrollment.  In this process interested individuals notify the TSA of their intention to 
request to become a TSA authorized third party auditor.  This requires the completion of the 
application and the subsequent TSA verification of the information provided therein.  The 10-
year cost for this component is estimated at $22,000. 
Initial Training.  All TSA authorized third party auditors must participate in an on-line, 
self-paced training.  While the training will be available through TSA-provide web access, the 
certifying examination must take place in a proctored environment.  TSA will establish a 
schedule for and the location of proctored examinations.  For the purposes of this analysis, TSA 
assumed that there would be a least one proctored examination at each of the 122 major hub 
airports.  The 10-year cost for this component is estimated at $20,000. 
Recurring Reapproval.  Reapproval is required biennially to remain a TSA-approved 
third party auditor.  Reapproval requires the individual to update her or his application and 
participate in refresher training.  Like the initial training, refresher training will be available 
through TSA-provide web access, the certifying examination; however, the requirement for a 
proctored examination is removed and replaced with an on line examination.  TSA analysts will 
109 
 review and verify the information provided during re-application and review the results of the 
online examination.  Additionally, TSA will review the performance of the auditor by evaluating 
the number of no-finding audits that were subsequently determined to be deficient as a result of 
the audit sampling process described in the Providing Compliance section of this analysis.  The 
10-year cost for this component is estimated at $34,000. 
 Course Development and Maintenance.  TSA projects initial cost development at 
$100,000 with the annual cost of maintenance at $35,000.  The 10-year cost for this component 
is estimated at $415,000. 
These costs are exclusive of the security threat assessment costs of $74 per individual.  
Under the proposed rule, auditors would be required to undergo a successful security threat 
assessment that would include a check against government terrorism watch lists and related 
databases as well as a criminal history records check.  The cost for this security threat assessment 
is described in the rule preamble.

 Watch List Service Provider Enrollment 
Currently, approximately 774 aircraft operators that are required to have a Twelve-Five 
or Private Charter Standard Security Program under 49 CFR 1544.101, which includes checking 
passenger information against the No Fly List.  They perform the check by obtaining the No Fly 
List from TSA and comparing their passengers’ information against the list.  Under this NPRM, 
the number of aircraft operators that would be required to conduct the watch list matching, which 
includes both the No Fly and Selectee lists, would increase to approximately 9,061 operators.  
Providing direct access to the watch list to this greatly expanded population may compromise the 
security of the list, which contains sensitive security information.  To limit the number of entities 
that have access to the watch list, TSA proposes to require large aircraft operators to submit 
passenger information to a TSA-approved watch list service provider.  This process would also 
increase efficiency and consistency in the watch list match process among large aircraft 
operators.   
While these costs are not significant, TSA provides a brief description of these in this 
section in the interest of transparency.  The total for this costs segment amount to approximately 
$23,000 over a 10-year period; discounted at 3% and 7% this amounts to approximately $22,000 
and $21,000, respectively.

The low and high estimates are based on assuming differing estimates of the net watch 
list service provider employee turn over rate.  In the case of the primary estimate, the net watch 
list service provider employee turnover rate was assumed to be 5%.  The low estimate is based 
on 75% of the population underlying the primary estimate while the high estimate is based on 
125% of the population underlying the primary estimate; there is negligible difference between 
the two estimates. 
For analytical purposes, the estimated total cost for the auditor enrollment has been 
divided into two cost components, these are:  firm enrollment and employee enrollment.  Each of 
these is discussed more fully below.   
Firm Enrollment.  In this process interested firms notify the TSA of their intention to 
request to become a TSA authorized watch list service provider.  This requires the completion of 
the application and the subsequent TSA review.  The application would include the applicant’s 
full name, business address, business phone and business email address.  The application must 
also include a statement and other supporting documentation providing evidence of the 
applicants’ abilities and satisfaction of the required qualifications.  Additionally, the applicant 
would need to demonstrate the ability to receive passenger information from large aircraft 
112 
 operators and conduct automated watch list matching and continuous vetting of individuals and 
transmit the watch list matching results to the large aircraft operator.   
The system that the applicant would use to perform the necessary transmissions and 
matching must meet standards to be set forth by TSA and drawn from the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology’s Special Publication #800-53.  TSA would choose standards in 
accordance with its determination that the security categorizations for the Confidentiality, 
Integrity, and Availability aspects of the systems would be “high,” as described in Federal 
Information Processing Standards Publication 199.  Watch list service providers would be 
required to contract with an independent public accounting firm and undergo an audit within 6 
months of commencing operations and annually thereafter to ensure their systems met the 
specified standards. 
The final qualification would be to have the applicant successfully undergo a suitability 
assessment by TSA, including a determination by TSA that the applicant and its covered 
employees do not pose a threat to transportation or national security.  These costs are exclusive 
of the security threat assessment costs of $74.  Under the proposed rule, employees of watch list 
service providers would be required to undergo a successful security threat assessment that 
includes a check against government terrorism watch lists and related databases.  The cost for 
this security threat assessment is described in the rule preamble. 
Upon receipt of the application, TSA will review the application and may conduct a site 
visit of the applicant’s place of business to determine whether the applicant satisfies the 
necessary qualifications.  The 10-year cost for this component is estimated at approximately 
$17,000. 
113 
 Employee Enrollment.  In this process, covered employees of firms applying to become 
TSA-approved watch list service providers notify the TSA.  This requires the completion of the 
application and the subsequent TSA review.  These costs are exclusive of the security threat 
assessment costs.  As stated above, these employees would be required to undergo a check 
against government terrorism databases, the cost of which is described in the rule preamble.  The 
10-year cost for this component is estimated at $6,000.

Finally, TSA would incur costs associated with periodic auditing of the firms that provide 
Watch List Matching services.  Estimates for these costs are reported in Figure 49 on a per firm 
basis.  The Primary cost estimate assumes 20 firms providing watch list matching services, with 
the Low and High estimates based on an assumption of 10 and 30 firms respectively.

PASSENGER OPPORTUNITY COST 
Passenger opportunity costs derive from two distinct events.  The first arises from the 
requirement for passengers to provide personal information to the aircraft operator preliminary to 
the watch list matching process.  The second results form those instances when the aircraft 
operator receives a No-fly message from the watch list service provider and the flight is delayed 
while the aircraft operator attempts to resolve the No-fly status.   
Delays due to passenger information submission.  The proposed regulation would 
require each aircraft operator to request and obtain certain passenger information from every 
passenger on each flight operated by the aircraft operator and transmit the information to an 
entity approved by TSA to conduct watch list matching (watch list service provider).  Any 
changes to the passenger information prior to boarding would be required to be resent to the 
watch list service provider. 
As stated above, TSA anticipates most, if not all, watch list service providers would offer 
a continuous vetting service to their subscribers through the use of a “master passenger list” 
designating those persons for continuous vetting.  Changes to this list would be required if the 
information for a previously identified passenger changed or in the case of a new passenger not 
previously identified to the service provider. 
The proposed rule specifies that the aircraft operator must obtain the full name of the 
115 
 passenger as it appears on a valid government-issued form of identification.  Additionally, the 
aircraft operator must request and send the passenger’s date of birth, gender, and redress number 
if available.  In addition, passport information (passport number, country of issuance, expiration 
date, gender, place of birth and full name of the passenger) must also be sent if in the possession 
of the operator; however, the proposed rule does not require an aircraft operator to request that 
information from passengers.  Designation of a passenger for continuous vetting requires that all 
of the requested passenger information, with the exception of the redress number be provided.  
Additionally, the passenger would be required to consent, in writing, to the submission of his or 
her information for continuous matching. 
As indicated above, TSA is seeking comments on whether to require covered aircraft 
operators to provide a privacy notice to individuals prior to collecting their information for watch 
list matching purposes. 
To estimate these opportunity costs arising from the proposed rule, TSA estimated the 
annual volume of passenger traffic on flights subject to the proposed rule.  Relatively little 
publicly available data exists on these passenger flows, and TSA welcomes comment from the 
public on the assumptions and methods used to estimate these flows.  For the proposed rule, 
passengers might be carried by operators characterized as non-scheduled Charter operators, 
business, corporate or fractional General Aviation operators, or personal use General Aviation 
operators.34
                                                 
34 In the FAA’s periodic survey of General Aviation Activity and Avionics, which provides statistical reporting on a 
survey of General Aviation (GA) aircraft owners and operators, a number of use categories for GA aircraft are 
defined and which survey respondents can use to characterize their own activity.  Among them are personal use, 
which is flying for personal reasons and explicitly excludes business transportation, corporate activity, which 
involves business transportation using a paid flight crew, and business activity, which is business transportation 
without a paid flight crew.  Corporate transportation includes Part 91, Subpart K fractional activity, but fractional 
operations can be separately identified in the ETMS database of IFR system activity.   The most recent (2006) FAA 
GA Survey can be found at http://www.faa.gov/data_statistics/aviation_data_statistics/general_aviation/CY2006/  
116 
 TSA assumed that passenger operations by aircraft operators subject to the proposed rule 
would be conducted under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), and would thus appear among the 
controlled flight operations in the DOT’s Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) 
database, which includes flight records for all flights under direct radar control.  ETMS flight 
records from FY2007 have been used by FAA to support a highly detailed database of annual 
flight activity by specific types of airspace uses.  This database was used to identify flight 
characteristics for over 14,000,000 IFR flights in FY 2007.  Among the user groups are 
Fractional operations, operating under 14 CFR Part 91, Subpart K, non-scheduled Part 135 
passenger operations, and General Aviation users used for corporate, business and personal 
operations.  Further analysis of this data, based on aircraft tail numbers in the ETMS flight 
records, allows these flights to be parsed by aircraft size and engine type. 
Aircraft type, engine type, weight and manufacturer-specified seat counts are part of the 
FAA database used for this analysis, which allowed flights in the user groups of interest to be 
limited to those in aircraft with MTOW of 12,501 pounds or more.  Figure 50 reports FY07 
ETMS flights by these user groups, by engine type (except for Fractional users, since virtually all 
Fractional flights are by jet aircraft).  For each user type, the average seat count per aircraft is 
also shown, based on an average weighted by annual flight counts.

As noted above, the seat counts used to develop the group averages reported in Figure 50 
are taken from manufacturer specifications.  Survey data collected by the National Business 
Aviation Association (NBAA) suggests that corporate and business users transport an average of 
4 passengers per flight.35  In this analysis, TSA used an average load factor of 50 percent for 
flights by aircraft operators subject to the proposed regulation, but TSA requests information and 
comment on this issue from the user community and other interested parties. 
For passengers on these flights, opportunity costs will be incurred when it is required that 
time be spent providing personal information to flight operators.  In many cases, passengers will 
be repeat fliers, and will only need to provide personal information to aircraft operators in 
response to an initial request.  For future flights, operators will rely on continuous vetting, in 
which passenger information will be continuously matched against watch lists.  In other cases, 
such as charter passengers, personal data will need to be collected for virtually each voyage.  In 
the estimates for opportunity time costs reported below, TSA has taken account of these different 
information management circumstances, but requests further information and comment on this 
issue from the user community and interested parties. 
Thus, for this analysis, TSA assumes that for charter users, each charter passenger must 
respond to a request for personal information from the aircraft operator prior to each trip in every

 year of the analysis since every passenger is new passenger.  However, for the other user types, 
TSA assumes that the percentage of passengers require respond to request for information will 
change over time an since many of these passengers will be repeat passengers.  For Fractional 
users, it is assumed that in the first year of the proposed rule, 75% of passenger trips would be 
taken by a passenger unknown to the operator and, therefore,  require a request for personal 
information.  For the remaining 25% of passenger trips in the first year, it is assumed that the 
passenger has become known to the operator and has already provided personal information, 
which has been retained in a passenger profile.  In subsequent years for fractional operations, 
these percentages are estimated to be 50% and 50%, taking account of the fact that the 
population of those owning fractional shares will change and evolve from year to year.  
Similarly, for private, business and corporate users, it is assumed that in the first year of the 
proposed rule, 75% of passenger trips would be taken by a passenger unknown to the operator 
and, therefore, require a request for personal information.  For the remaining 25% of passenger 
trips in the first year, it is assumed that the passenger has traveled previously in the year and has 
already provided personal information, which has been retained in a passenger profile.  In 
subsequent years, these percentages are estimated to be 25% first time passengers (or established 
passengers who must update a personal profile) and 75% established passengers who have a 
personal information profile available with the operator.  It should be reiterated that these 
percentages represent assumptions which appear to TSA to be reasonable ones, but TSA requests 
further information on this topic from users and interested parties. 
It should be noted that for flights arriving from or departing to international locations, the 
aircraft operators would already be required to provide passenger information to Customs and 
Border Patrol for entry into the electronic Advanced Passenger Information System (eAPIS). 
119 
 It is assumed that passengers who must provide personal information in response to a 
request from the aircraft operator use 30 seconds on average on this requirement.  Passenger trips 
involving those with a personal information profile already available to aircraft operators are 
assumed to entail no opportunity cost for passengers in the form of time required to respond to a 
personal information request. 
Travel undertaken using the types of operators who would be covered under the proposed 
rule may be for either business or personal purposes, and DOT guidance on the value of 
passenger time reports different values for these purposes.  In year 2000 dollars, the value of 
time for business passengers is set at $45, while the value of time for personal travel is set at 
$31.50.  A composite or “all purposes” value is set at $37.20.36  In this analysis, the value of 
time for personal travel purpose is used for personal aircraft users and their passengers.  The 
value of time for business travel purposes is used for passengers of business and corporate 
aircraft users.  The composite value is used for those traveling with fractional or charter 
operators.  Using this valuation approach, the 12.5 million passengers using the regulated 
operators in the first year would devote 86,911 hours to the provision of personal information for 
security purposes, at a total opportunity cost of $3.5 million.  These hours are the sum of 
passenger opportunity hours by aircraft type across all aircraft types for one year and are 
developed according to the following: 
Pax opportunity hours for year one, for aircraft type1= ! {[((total flights) x (50% x pax load factor)) x first time pax%] x hours/pax} 
Based on this calculation total pax opportunity hours for the first year are: 
pax opportunity hours for the first year = pax opportunity hours in the first year for fractional aircraft all engines + … + pax 
opportunity hours for the first year for personal aircraft all engines.

 Note that calculating these values requires that the FAA forecasting factors be applied to derive 
the total flights for a given aircraft type in a given year.  These calculations use as an input the 
data for the user classes presented in Figure 49. 
TSA assumes that passenger traffic using the operators subject to the proposed rule 
would grow at the same rate that GA activity grows.  According to FAA forecasts, this activity 
growth will vary by aircraft engine type fleets.  GA piston traffic will decline by 0.2% per year 
over the next decade, while turboprop traffic will increase by 0.6% per year and GA jet traffic, 
the fastest growing sector, will grow by 6% per year over the next decade.37  Applying these 
growth forecasts to the FY07 activity data results in the prospective opportunity cost data 
presented in Figure 51.  Over the 10 years analyzed for the proposed rule, passengers using 
services provided by the regulated parties would incur $20.0 million in opportunity costs 
discounted at 7% as a consequence of providing personal information in response to security 
requirements.

Delays due to no-fly messages.  The operator would not be permitted to allow a 
passenger aboard an aircraft until the operator received a watch list result from the service 
provider.  If the passenger were cleared to board the aircraft, the operator could then permit the 
passenger to board.  If the passenger is identified as a Selectee, the large aircraft operator may 
permit the passenger to board the aircraft according to the procedures described in its security 
program.   
In those instances when the watch list service provider instructs the operator to deny 
boarding, the operator could not permit the passenger to board.  In these cases the operator would 
contact TSA, pursuant to the procedures set forth in its security program, for resolution; this may 
include providing additional information. 
With respect to selectees, the proposed regulation provides a mechanism to board these 
passengers without delay.  Given that no delay is associated with the selectee status, TSA did not 
estimate an associated passenger opportunity cost. 
With respect to those passengers for whom the operator has received a “no fly” 
instruction, a potential for delay exists inasmuch as the operator is required to interact with TSA 
in attempt to resolve the condition.  However, the decision to pursue the “no fly” to resolution 
that concludes with boarding the passenger depends on the type of service an operator is 
providing. 
TSA estimated the passenger opportunity cost associated with the delay caused by this 
additional interaction between the operator’s security coordinator and the passenger to be a ten 
year total of $10,946 discounted at seven percent.  These costs not only represent the cost to the 
122 
 individual required to interact with the security coordinator but also the crew and passengers of 
the delayed flight.

High $13,682.5 $11,671.5 $9,610.0 
 
 These costs were developed based on the following methodology.  There are three 
possible outcomes to a “no fly” instruction: 1) the aircraft flies but the passenger is not boarded 
and substitutes another mode; 2) the aircraft flies but the passenger is not boarded and terminates 
travel; or 3) the entire flight does not continue.  However, the degree to which an aircraft 
operator will pursue resolution differs by type of operation. 
 For illustration, examples are provided:  Operators of large charter aircraft booked as part 
of travel packages will pursue resolution to a degree but ultimately, if necessary, refuse boarding 
to the passenger; most likely that passenger will terminate travel, and the flight continues without 
the “no fly” passenger.  Operators of other GA aircraft will pursue resolution to a greater degree 
(which will depend upon the type of operation) but ultimately, if necessary, refuse boarding to 
the passenger.  In the instance of a flight with only one passenger, or of a passenger who is the 
primary reason for the flight, resulting in a “no fly” response, the entire flight would likely not 
continue. 
123 
  For the purposes of continuing the analysis TSA has set the length of time for operator-
TSA interaction to resolve a no-fly status as a range from 10 to 30 minutes.  Placing time values 
against terms like “to a degree”, “to a greater degree” and, “to a significant degree” while 
informed, still contains some uncertainty.  TSA requests comments on this range of values. 
 The larger issue is how often the no-fly event occurs.  For the purposes of continuing the 
analysis TSA has established frequency estimates for each of the examples described above so 
that:  Operators of large charter aircraft booked as part of travel packages will experience one no-
fly event every quarter.  Operators of passenger charter aircraft will experience one no-fly event 
every six months.  Operators of fractional aircraft will experience one no-fly event every year.  
Operators of private aircraft will experience one no-fly event every two years.  To be sure, 
placing a distribution of values for these events while informed, will still be rather arbitrary.  
TSA requests comments on this range of values.  The following table presents the relationships 
discussed in the narrative.

$10,946 over ten years, undiscounted.

 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
 
 
 
TSA considered four substantive alternatives to the proposed regulation.  First, TSA 
considered using the current method of watch list matching employed by aircraft operators under 
the TFSSP and PCSSP rules.  Second, TSA considered using TSA inspectors to conduct audits 
instead of TSA approved third party auditors.  Third, TSA considered leveraging the Secure 
Flight program currently under development, which would use a web-based application for 
transmission of passenger information to the Secure Flight vetting engine.  Fourth, TSA 
evaluated the incremental impact of raising the aircraft weight threshold from 12,500 pounds 
MTOW to 16,500 pounds MTOW and the incremental impact of lowering the aircraft weight 
threshold to 10,500 pounds MTOW.  This section describes those alternatives relative to the 
proposed regulation.  TSA invites comments on these or other substantive alternatives to the 
proposed rule.  
Watch List Matching 
TSA considered requiring all large-aircraft operators to conduct watch list matching as 
currently done under the Twelve-Five and Private Charter Programs.  These aircraft operators 
currently run their passengers against the No Fly and Selectee List, which they retrieve from 
TSA.  The proposed rule would require aircraft operators to send passenger information to a 
TSA-approved watch list service provider.  The alternative to the proposed rule is to extend the 
current method of watch list matching under the Twelve-Five and Private Charter Rules to large 
aircraft operators that are not currently required to have a security program.  Operationally, this 
would require that a total of approximately 9,835 aircraft operators have direct access to the No 
Fly List and Selectee list from TSA. 
126 
 TSA has rejected this alternative based on security and cost grounds.  First, expanding 
direct access to the watch list from 750 aircraft operators today to 9,835 under this alternative 
increases the opportunity for the list to be compromised and would contradict other TSA 
initiatives to limit distribution of the watch lists in accordance with direction outlined in 
Homeland Security Presidential Directive-16 and National Security Presidential Directive-47.  
Additionally, the current TSA system does not provide TSA the ability to actually verify that the 
watch list vetting is properly conducted.  In order to limit the number of entities that have access 
to the watch list, TSA proposes to require large aircraft operators to submit passenger 
information to a TSA-approved watch list service provider.  The proposal would reduce the 
number of entities with direct access to the watch list, and improve consistency and accuracy of 
watch list matching by ensuring compliance with watch list matching standards thus improving 
security. 
As a secondary reason for rejecting this alternative, TSA has identified no cost advantage 
that aircraft operators would enjoy by maintaining the ability to vet their own passengers.  Many 
aircraft operators discharge their current responsibilities to vet passengers by contracting with 
third party service providers, and we would expect this practice to be widely adopted even in the 
absence of this requirement for third party watch-list matching. 
TSA Inspectors 
TSA considered using TSA inspectors instead of approved third-party auditors to 
complete the audits proposed in the rule.  Under such a scenario, TSA would need to hire new 
employees to complete the inspections.  Each operator would complete a TSA inspection every 
other year.  TSA would conduct all of the inspections.  The cost analysis assumes that 10.8% of 
initial inspections would have issues that could be resolved with a second inspection and 1.4% 
127 
 would require a third inspection.  Each inspection would require 17.8 hours to complete, 
exclusive of travel time.  TSA’s hourly cost for inspectors would be $56.18 per hour.  On 
average, inspections would cost $998, not including the cost for travel.  Completing a total of 
58,700 inspections over ten years would cost an estimated $58.6 million.  However, these costs 
do not include the cost of hiring, training, and managing the TSA inspectors.  See Figure 55 for 
annual detail.

Adding the cost for operators to complete third-party audits and for TSA to complete 
reviews of those audits, the policy in the proposed rule would cost $130.4 million over 10 years.  
Over the 10-year period, implementing the proposed rule would cost $71.9 million more than the 
alternative.

Evaluating a Different Design 
The foregoing analysis evaluated alternatives based on changes to particular elements of 
the processes underlying the proposed rule; what follows is an evaluation of an alternative that 
posits a different process for vetting the passengers of general aviation aircraft operators.  
Specifically, TSA assumes that the automated watchlist matching role filled by the watch list 
service providers would be met by the Secure Flight program.  In the proposed rule, watch list 
service provider costs account for $45.6 million or 2.8 percent of aircraft operator costs.  In 
terms of total regulatory costs, watch list service provider costs amount to 2.4 percent; the 
remaining 97.6 percent of the regulatory costs of the proposed rule derives from procedures that 
would be unchanged by the introduction of Secure Flight into the watch list service provider role.  
Among these are the costs associated with the security program, training costs, and auditor costs 
for aircraft operators and airport operators, as well as the government costs associated with these 
processes. 
In the Secure Flight program currently under development, TSA has indicated the use of 
a web-based application for some transmissions of passenger information to the Secure Flight 
129 
 vetting engine.  Following that reasoning, this alternative is based on a browser interface of web 
services submission mechanism and proceeds on the expectation that the Secure Flight web 
application will be deployed as the mechanism by which general aviation aircraft operators will 
transmit passenger information for vetting against the watch lists.  This analysis reflects the early 
stage of development and cannot, given this early stage, include costs that may be identified as 
TSA proceeds with system development.  
While the design and development of the Secure Flight web-based application is in its 
early stages, TSA subject matter experts have provided two approaches to extending an already 
established web-based application to the general aircraft population.  These two approaches, in 
turn, yield two estimates of the incremental costs. 
They key difference between these approaches is the assumption made relative to the 
implementation of LASP.  In the first approach the implementation of LASP does not precede 
the extension of Secure Flight to the general aviation population while in the second; Secure 
Flight follows the implementation of LASP.  Central to this difference is recognition that 
preparing aircraft operators to transmit passenger information to a vetting agent and receive 
passenger information from a vetting agent requires a number of tasks to be performed.  Among 
these are, operational instruction (file format, processes and procedures) and testing (beta and 
operational), as well as customer service and support during the initial implementation period.  
Furthermore, these tasks, and the associated costs, will be incurred whether performed by the 
private sector (in the form of WLSPs) or the government sector (in the form of Secure Flight). 
The first approach, option-one, would be developed and implemented with the absence of 
an implemented LASP and would amount to $23.2 million undiscounted over ten years.  This 
approach posits that without an implemented LASP, Secure Flight would be required to establish 
130 
 a relationship with each of the aircraft operators.  TSA would work with aircraft operators to 
develop the formatting and transmission procedures for not only for the upload of passenger 
information but also the download of passenger vetting results.  These out-reach or ramp-up 
activities will be borne by the Secure Flight process.  The costs associated with these activities 
are identified in the table below as “airline interface coordinators” and are estimated to amount 
to amount to $3.0 million.

Under this option, the costs associated the watch list service providers as proposed in the 
rule would be removed and in their place these incremental Secure Flight costs would be 
131 
 substituted.  Previously, in the Cost of Compliance section, above, TSA estimated the ten-year, 
undiscounted costs of providing watch list matching costs at $45.6 million; these would be 
replaced by the $23.2 million identified in the table above.  TSA has not estimated the cost for 
operators to connect to the Secure Flight web-based application. 
The second approach, option-two, would be developed and implemented with the ability 
to leverage activities associated with a fully implemented LASP and would amount to $11.0 
million undiscounted over ten years.  This approach posits that an implemented LASP would 
establish a relationship with each of the aircraft operators during the initial deployment of the 
watch list service provider process.  During this period both TSA and the watch list service 
providers would work with aircraft operators to develop the formatting and transmission 
procedures for not only for the upload of passenger information but also the download of 
passenger vetting results.  As a result, Secure Flight would assume a relatively mature process.  
The costs associated with out-reach or ramp-up activities would have been borne by LASP and 
not Secure flight, therefore, they are not contained in the table below.

Under this option, the costs associated with the watch list service providers as proposed 
in the rule would be remain and at some point in time the vetting process would be taken over by 
132 
 Secure Flight.  Assuming the Secure Flight cut-over took place at the end of year five 
approximately $24.2 million of the $45.6 million undiscounted WLSP costs (those in years six 
through ten) would be removed and replaced by the undiscounted Secure Flight costs (those in 
years one through 5) of $5.9 million bringing the ten-year undiscounted total of the “mixed” 
approach to $27.3.

TSA has not estimated the cost for operators to connect to the Secure Flight web-based 
application; however, given the sophistication of the firms currently filling this role, the impact 
may not be large.  TSA is seeking comments specifically on this point. 
The forgoing analysis contains several critical assumptions; two among these are key:  
First, the thorough study required to clearly identify and evaluate the costs of developing a 
system to support the extension of Secure Flight to the general aviation, including a web-based 
interface, has not yet been undertaken and as a result there is a significant amount of uncertainty 
in these estimates.  Second, with respect to WLSP costs, the analysis assumes these costs are 
uniformly distributed over time and ignores the impact of the learning curve on the behavior of 
costs. 
Benefits:  The option of extending the Secure Flight program to general aviation may 
result in security benefits, by lowering the number of non-government entities having access to 
133 
 the watch-list, and by ensuring a more uniform approach to the screening of general aviation 
passengers.  Although the costs of this option differ very little from the proposed rule, TSA 
believes these security benefits may eventually be worth pursuing in the future.   
Comparison of the First Three Alternatives: 
TSA opted for the proposed plan as the more efficient and effective way of applying its 
limited compliance and enforcement resources towards the objective of increasing security.  The 
use of third-parties would allow TSA to meet its security mission into four important ways.   
First, third-party auditors would increase effective TSA oversight by reviewing each 
aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program six months after TSA approves its 
security program and every two years thereafter.   
Second, given the number of large aircraft operators (approximately 10,000), the third-
party auditor program would allow TSA to ramp up more quickly thereby obtaining the 
assessment of all large aircraft operators more quickly relative to a program that relied solely on 
TSA inspectors, given the associated hiring and training associated with new hires.   
Third, the third-party auditor program would allow TSA to focus more of its compliance 
and enforcement resources on aircraft operators that are experiencing problems with 
implementing and complying with their security programs.   
Fourth, the watch list matching service providers would provide the needed security and 
do so in a timely fashion.  Given the security concerns, TSA believes a reliable mechanism for 
watch list matching for large aircraft must be operational without undue delay.  While the Secure 
Flight Program would also provide a reliable mechanism, its development is likely to be several 
years away and it is likely that it would not be available to address this important security need 
when TSA would be ready to implement the LASP.   
134 
 This proposal is consistent with current practices in the aviation industry, which 
frequently rely on the Federal Aviation Administration’s designee program.  This type of 
program has been successfully implemented in other related aviation requirements. 
Additionally, the GA industry is very familiar with the third party auditor concept as it 
relates to safety inspections.  Many GA operators undergo third party audits each year to comply 
with customer requirements.  The proposal should be easily integrated into most GA operator’s 
existing audit schedules. 
Evaluating Different Aircraft Weight Thresholds 
As a final alternative, TSA explored whether the requirements should apply to a different low 
weight threshold.  The determination of weight must take into account a number of factors such 
as the effect on international harmonization, existing policies and programs, and the economic 
effect on the GA community.  Discussed below are three alternatives to the threshold weight 
issue. 
Alternative 1: Lower threshold weight to 10,500 pounds MTOW.  This solution will 
reduce the associated risk and number of unknown aircraft operators by incorporating an 
additional 3,000-5,000 aircraft into a mandatory security program.  This alternative would also 
include a portion of currently unregulated types of aircraft, including large turboprops and 
smaller jet aircraft.  However, in order to successfully implement this threshold weight, 
significant modifications to existing security programs that use the current weight threshold 
would likely be required.   Furthermore, this change would require additional international 
coordination, since TSA would be moving away from the globally accepted International Civil 
Aviation Organization standards. 
135 
 TSA estimates the cost impact of option one, in terms of undiscounted annualized dollars 
would add $23.7 million to the undiscounted annualized cost of the rule as proposed.  The costs 
for option one were developed as follows:  TSA assumed that the entire population of additional 
aircraft operators would be newly regulated.  The cost was established for this group based on 
the new operator costs discussed above, in terms of annualized, undiscounted 10-year costs and 
dividing by the average new operators over the 10-year period.  Assuming ceteris paribus, this 
cost was applied to the number of new operators based on flights to provide an estimate of the 
incremental costs to extend the rule to this group. 
Altrnative 2: Raise threshold weight to 16,000 pounds MTOW.  This option would 
reduce the number of regulated aircraft and parties by approximately 9,000 aircraft which would 
ultimately decrease the inspection requirements on TSA resources.  However, excluding these 
aircraft would greatly increase the potential risk and could result in higher damage potential.  
TSA believes that this increased risk and damage potential of aircraft between greater than 
12,500 pounds MTOW and 16,000 pounds MTOW are not justified by the reduction in cost.  
Furthermore, moving away from the common greater than 12,500 pounds MTOW threshold will 
yield the same concerns discussed in alternative one. 
TSA estimates the cost impact of option two, in terms of undiscounted annualized dollars 
would subtract $26.4 million from the undiscounted annualized cost of the rule as proposed.  The 
costs for option two were developed as follows:  TSA assumed that the population of aircraft 
operators could be described by the mix of new and existing operators as in the population 
underlying the rule as proposed.  The cost for newly regulated operators was established based 
on the new operator costs discussed above, in terms of annualized, undiscounted 10-year costs 
and dividing by the average new operators over the 10-year period.  The cost for already 
136 
 regulated operators was established based on the existing operator costs discussed above, in 
terms of annualized, undiscounted 10-year costs and dividing by the average existing operators 
over the 10-year period.  Assuming ceteris paribus, these costs were applied to the number of 
new operators and existing operators respectively based on flights.  These values were summed 
to provide an estimate of the incremental costs of limiting the rule to this group. 
 The costs for this analysis were based on those developed for new and existing aircraft 
operators in the Cost of Compliance section, above; they appear in the table below.

and Compliance ($190.05 million), as well as Passenger Opportunity Costs ($28.829 million) 
were distributed based on the distribution of new and old aircraft operators to yield total costs of 
$1.306 million.  These are the costs associated with aircraft with a MTOW greater than 12,500 
pounds.

threshold to 16,000 pounds MTOW, as well as the increase in operators as a result of lowering 
137

grouping.

Based on the above discussion and analysis, TSA technical experts recommend that the 
threshold of 12,501 pounds MTOW be retained as the recognized security threshold weight 
standard for current and future GA security programs and policies.  Selecting a lower threshold 
weight would improve security because more aircraft would be subject to the LASP but would 
also increase the burden to industry to the point where the burden may not be fully supported by 
increased security.  Selecting a higher threshold weight would lower the burden on the industry 
because a lower number of aircraft would be subject to the LASP.  However, with this higher 
threshold weight, the proposed LASP would not cover many aircraft that can cause significant 
damage if used as a missile or to deliver a biological, chemical, or nuclear weapon.  TSA 
believes that mitigating the potential security risk and damage potential of large aircraft 16,000 
pounds MTOW or under outweighs the cost difference.  Consequently, TSA believes that the 
weight threshold of greater than 12,500 pounds MTOW is the appropriate balance of risk and 
burden. 
 
138 
 INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ASSESSMENT 
 
 
 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) establishes “as a principle of regulatory 
issuance that agencies shall endeavor, consistent with the objective of the rule and of applicable 
statutes, to fit regulatory and informational requirements to the scale of the business, 
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.”  To achieve that principle, 
the RFA requires agencies to solicit and consider flexible regulatory proposals and to explain the 
rationale for their actions.  The RFA covers a wide range of small entities, including small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. 
When issuing a rulemaking, agencies must perform a review to determine whether a 
proposed or final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.  If the determination is that it will, the agency must prepare a regulatory flexibility 
analysis as described in the RFA.  However, if an agency determines that a proposed or final rule 
is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, 
section 605(b) of the RFA provides that the head of the agency may so certify and a regulatory 
flexibility analysis is not required.  The certification must include a statement providing the 
factual basis for this determination, and the reasoning should be clear. 
As part of implementing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), TSA conducted 
this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA).  The IRFA describes the reasons for and 
objectives of the proposed rule; includes a description and estimate of the number of small 
entities that would be impacted by the proposed rule; estimates the cost of complying with 
requirements for small entities; addresses significant alternatives to the rulemaking considered 
by TSA; and, identifies duplicative, overlapping, and conflicting rules.   
139 
 REASON FOR THE PROPOSED RULE 
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) (Pub. L. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597, 
Nov. 19, 2001) granted TSA broad statutory authority to take measures to increase the security 
of civil aviation in the United States.  Since the passage of ATSA, TSA has used its authority to 
implement an array of aviation security programs, focusing mainly on the commercial aviation 
segment of the industry.   
TSA is aware that as vulnerabilities within the air carrier and commercial operator 
segment of the aviation industry are reduced, general aviation (GA) operations may become 
more attractive targets.  With thousands of operators flying over one hundred thousand aircraft, 
firms operating in the GA market – including some smaller airports – are largely unregulated 
with respect to security.  Many GA aircraft, however, are of the same size and weight of the 
commercial operators that TSA regulates, meaning that they potentially and effectively could be 
used to commit a terrorist act. 
Consequently, this portion of the aviation industry may be vulnerable to exploitation by 
terrorists.  Except for limited security requirements for certain classes of GA aircraft, TSA does 
not currently require security programs for many GA aircraft operators.  This presents a security 
risk. 
The proposed rule would mitigate this risk by requiring GA aircraft operators and certain 
airports to enact an assortment of security measures. 
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RULE 
The objective of the proposed rule is to strengthen the security of civil aviation. 
 
140 
 DESCRIPTION AND ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF SMALL ENTITIES 
The proposed rule would impact certain firms flying aircraft with a maximum take-off 
weight greater than 12,500 pounds in the civil aviation market.  It would also impact certain 
publicly- and privately-owned airports.  This section of the IRFA attempts to describe and 
identify all small entities within the aforementioned industries, including those operating under 
existing security regulations and those that are currently not regulated. 
Currently Regulated Aircraft Operators 
The proposed rule would affect aircraft operators currently offering services under 
existing security regulations.  Aircraft operators utilizing TSA-required security programs, 
including the Twelve-Five Standard Security Program (TFSSP), the All Cargo Twelve-Five 
Standard Security Program (TFSSP-AC), the Partial Program Standard Security Program 
(PPSSP), and the Private Charter Standard Security Program (PCSSP) would be covered by the 
proposed rule. 
Aircraft operators offering services under the TFSSP and the TFSSP-AC utilize aircraft 
with a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of more than 12,500 pounds; offer scheduled or 
charter service; carry passengers or cargo or both; and do not operate under a private charter or 
partial security program. 
The PPSSP is used by scheduled passenger or public charter passenger operations using 
aircraft with seating configurations of 31 or more, but 60 or fewer seats that do not enplane from 
or deplane into a sterile area, and by scheduled passenger or public charter passenger operations 
using aircraft with seating configurations of 60 or fewer seats engaged in operations to, from, or 
outside the United States that do not enplane from or deplane into a sterile area.  
141 
 The requirements of the PPSSP are identical to those of the TFSSP, with the exception 
that the PPSSP requires operators to participate in airport operator-sponsored exercises of airport 
contingency plans.  TSA estimated that approximately 649 operators, utilizing 4,540 large 
aircraft, were conducting operations either solely or primarily under the TFSSP or PPSSP at the 
time of writing.  (Within the text of this IRFA, Twelve-Five and Partial Program operators may 
be referred to collectively as TFSSP operators due to the extremely small number of Partial 
Program operators, the similarities between the two groups, and the fact that they would be 
merged under the proposed regulation). 
Conversely, aircraft operators using privately chartered aircraft (aircraft hired by, and for, 
one specific group of people) having a MTOW greater than 45,500 kg (100,309.3 pounds); or a 
passenger seating configuration of 61 or more seats; or, that enplane from or deplane into a 
sterile area, operate under the PCSSP.  To be considered a private charter, the charterer must 
have engaged the total passenger capacity of the aircraft, invited all of the passengers, borne all 
of the costs of the charter, and must not have advertised to the public, in any way, to solicit 
passengers. 
In conducting research for the Regulatory Evaluation, TSA generated estimates of the 
number of operators offering services under each security program described above.  The 
estimates are shown in the figure below. 
Figure 64: LASP Aircraft Operators Currently Operating Under a TSA Security Program 
Existing Security Program or Operating Certificate Number of Aircraft Operators
Twelve-Five Standard Security Program 649 
All Cargo Twelve-Five Standard Security Program 48 
Private Charter Standard Security Program 77 
Total 774 
 
To determine if the firms identified in the figure above qualify as small entities as defined 
by the RFA and the Small Business Administration (SBA), TSA first attempted to classify each 
142 
 firm using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes maintained by the 
U.S. Census Bureau.  After analyzing the various operators’ characteristics and the NAICS 
codes, TSA determined that the aircraft operators described above would broadly fall into the 
nonscheduled air transportation market.  Firms in NAICS code 481211, Nonscheduled Chartered 
Passenger Air Transportation, and 481212, Nonscheduled Charter Freight Air Transportation, are 
classified as large or small based on employee measures.  Firms in these markets with less than 
1,500 employees are considered small by the SBA. 
Unfortunately, TSA could not obtain current, detailed employee data for the respective 
firms, making it difficult to discern whether the firms are small or large according to standards 
set by the SBA.  In light of the lack of current employee data on these firms, TSA turned to U.S. 
Census Bureau information to gauge the number of currently regulated entities affected by the 
proposed rule that may be considered small.   
NAICS 481211 – Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation 
As stated above, the SBA defines any firm in the Nonscheduled Chartered 
Passenger Air Transportation industry with less than 1,500 employees as small.  Using 
2002 data maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau, TSA determined that there are 1,400 
firms in the industry, and at least 1,178 of these firms are small entities.  The average 
annual revenue for firms in this industry in 2002 was approximately $3.9 million.  The 
data that TSA accessed from the Census Bureau to make this determination did not have 
enough detail for the Agency to draw a conclusion on the remaining 222 firms.  See the 
figure below.

these firms are small entities.  The average annual revenue for firms in this industry in 2002 was 
approximately $5.0 million.  The data that TSA accessed from the Census Bureau to make this

Firms operating aircraft under the TFSSP and the PCSSP likely fall into NAICS code 
481211, Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation, described above.  As previously 
stated, TSA estimated that there are 649 and 77 TFSSP and PCSSP operators, respectively, that 
would be affected by the NPRM.  In all likelihood, these operators represent a subset of the firms 
TSA identified using the Census data.  So while TSA identified 1,178 small entities (and 222 
potentially small entities) in the overall Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air Transportation 
market, it is not likely that all of those firms would be impacted by the proposed rule. 
Firms operating under the TFSSP-AC most likely are classified by the Census Bureau by 
NAICS code 481212, Nonscheduled Chartered Freight Air Transportation.  As stated above, 
TSA estimated that the proposed rule would only affect 48 of these operators.  It is likely that the 
48 operators represent a subset of the firms TSA identified in the Census data described above. 
By adding the estimated number of TFSSP, PCSSP, and TFSSP-AC operators together, 
TSA was able to conclude that the proposed rule would affect a total of 774 currently regulated 
145 
 operators.  In 2003, pursuant to another rulemaking, TSA estimated that of 767 TFSSP, TFSSP-
AC, and PCSSP operators, all but 15 were small entities.  Typically, these types of operators are 
independently owned and operated, and rarely employ more than 1,500 employees, making them 
small entities according to the SBA.  Given that TSA has not received any new data on these 
operators since 2003, and given the lack of detail in the Census Bureau data, the Agency 
assumed for the purposes of this analysis that all but 15 of the 774 operators that would be 
affected by this NPRM are small entities.  The Agency seeks comment on this preliminary 
conclusion. 
Newly Regulated Aircraft Operators 
The proposed rule would also cover any aircraft operator using an aircraft having a 
MTOW greater than 12,500 pounds.  Such operators primarily conduct operations under 14 CFR 
part 91 and 14 CFR part 125.  Currently, these types of operators are generally not covered by 
existing security regulations. 
Part 91 operations, commonly referred to as GA operations, can be undertaken for a wide 
range of purposes, but a basic distinction is drawn between flight activity used to provide 
“common carriage” and other flight activity.  Common carriage means any operation for 
compensation or hire where the operator holds itself out as willing to furnish transportation to 
any member of the public seeking the services offered.  The operator openly offers a service for a 
fee (by advertising or any other means) to members of the public. 
In contrast, private or non-common carriage does not involve offering or holding out by 
the operator through advertising or any other means.  Non-common carriage includes the 
following:  
! Carriage of operator’s own employees or property 
! Carriage of participating members of a club 
146 
 ! Carriage of persons and property which is only incidental to the operator’s 
primary business 
! Carriage of persons or property for compensation or hire under a contractual 
business arrangement that did not result from the operator’s holding out or 
offering. In this situation, the customer seeks out an operator to perform the 
desired service and enters into an exclusive mutual agreement; the operator does 
not seek out the customer. 
 
Under the proposed rule, both common carriage and non-common carriage large aircraft 
operators would be required to establish and implement the security requirements of the LASP.  
Those firms operating under common carriage have been discussed in the currently regulated 
section of this IRFA; the following discussion treats non-common carrier operations. 
14 CFR part 125 applies to some large aircraft operations that may provide private 
carriage (but not common carriage).  Part 125 governs the operation of large aircraft that are able 
to carry 6,000 pounds or more of payload capacity and 20 or more passenger seats.  
In conducting research for the Regulatory Evaluation, TSA subject matter experts 
determined that the proposed rule would affect 9,000 aircraft operators regulated by 14 CFR part 
91 and 61 aircraft operators regulated by 14 CFR part 125.  Due to the unique conditions under 
which these firms conduct operations, TSA could not identify the respective NAICS codes for 
these operators.  Consequently, the Agency could not determine the small entity size standards 
for these businesses.  Without this information, TSA could not reliably estimate the number of 
small entities operating aircraft in these operating categories.  Moreover, TSA could not find 
reliable revenue and employee data for these firms, further complicating the effort. 
Given the constraints discussed above, TSA could only conclude that the proposed rule 
would affect between 0 and 9,000 small entities currently regulated by 14 CFR part 91, and 
between 0 and 61 small entities currently regulated by 14 CFR part 125.  The Agency seeks 
147 
 comment on information that would allow it to refine its estimate of small entities as defined by 
the RFA.  
Airport Operators 
Airports that would be affected by the proposed rule include airports regularly serving 
scheduled or public charter operations in large aircraft and “reliever airports,” as designated by 
the Secretary of Transportation.  TSA determined approximately 42 airports regularly serving 
scheduled or public charter operations and 273 reliever airports would be subject to the proposed 
rule, a total of 315 airports. 
The 42 affected airports TSA has identified that regularly serve scheduled or public 
charter operations and do not already have a TSA security program are all owned by public 
entities.  Because the airports are publicly-owned, the Census Bureau classifies them using 
NAICS Code 926120, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs. 
Reliever airports are airports designated by the FAA to relieve congestion at commercial 
service airports and to provide improved general aviation access to members of the local 
community.38  The 273 reliever airports that would be impacted by the rule are owned by public 
entities – such as State and local governments – and private, for-profit concerns.  The publicly- 
and privately-owned airports, due to their different ownership characteristics, are classified by 
different NAICS codes by the U.S. Census Bureau.  Privately-owned airports are classified by 
NAICS code 48811, Airport Operations, while publicly-owned airports are classified by NAICS 
code 926120, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs.

 NAICS 48811 – Airport Operations 
Private firms operating reliever airports fall into NAICS code 48811, Airport Operations.  
The SBA defines firms in this industry with less than $6.5 million in annual revenues as small.  
To discern the number of small firms likely to be impacted by the proposed rule, TSA first 
obtained data on the total number affected reliever airports from FAA.  From the FAA 
information, which identified 273 total reliever airports that would be subject to the rule, TSA 
was able to identify 46 privately-held reliever airports. 
Unfortunately, TSA could not find any revenue information on the 46 privately-owned 
reliever airports, making it impossible to determine if they are classified as small entities.  
However, given that the average annual revenues in the industry were $3.8 million in 2002, well 
below the $6.5 million threshold set by SBA, it is likely that some of the affected firms are small 
entities.  Due to the lack of available revenue data, TSA assumed for the purposes of this 
analysis that there are between 0 and 46 small entities in this industry that would be impacted by 
the rule.  The Agency seeks comment on this assumption. 
NAICS 926120 – Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs 
As previously stated, publicly-owned reliever airports likely fall into NAICS code 
926120, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs.  Because firms in this 
industry are not privately held, for-profit companies, the SBA does not use revenue or 
employment measures to determine if they are small entities. 
Instead, the SBA uses the population of the government jurisdiction that owns the firm to 
determine if it is a small governmental jurisdiction.  Specifically, section 601(5) of the RFA 
149 
 defines small governmental jurisdictions as governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, 
villages, school districts, or special districts with a population of less than 50,000.39
To determine if the proposed rule would have an impact on any small governmental 
jurisdictions, TSA again accessed the FAA airport data.  Of the 315 affected airports, TSA 
discerned that 269 are owned by governments.  After researching the population of all the 
affected governments using U.S. Census Bureau population data, TSA concluded that between 
68 and 74 small governmental jurisdictions would be impacted by the proposed rule.  See the 
figure below.

Summary of Number of Small Entities 
Using the data discussed above, TSA concluded that the NPRM would impact between 
827 and 9,955 small entities.  The ambiguous nature of the revenue and employee data for the 
firms in some of the affected industries, coupled with the lack of information on operators

estimate.  See the figure below.

The data used to determine the number of impacted small entities in this analysis exhibit 
some critical shortcomings.  First, TSA did not have access to any comprehensive employment 
data for some of the affected aircraft operators in the nonscheduled air transportation industry. 
Second, the Agency was unable to access comprehensive revenue or employment data for 
the aircraft operators offering services under 14 CFR part 91 and 14 CFR part 125.  Additionally, 
TSA could not identify the appropriate NAICS codes for these operators, making it impossible to 
identify the size standard that would be necessary to determine if the firms are large or small. 
Third, TSA could not obtain revenue data for firms operating privately-owned reliever 
airports, making it impossible to generate an accurate estimate of the number of small entities in 
that industry. 
151 
 Finally, the Agency was unable to find reliable information on some of the governmental 
jurisdictions operating covered airports.  This prevented the Agency from making a more 
accurate estimate of the number of small governmental jurisdictions that would be subject to the 
proposed rule. 
Due to the reasons described above, TSA may have under- or overestimated the number 
of affected small entities.  The Agency seeks comment on this possibility. 
DESCRIPTION AND ESTIMATE OF COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS 
The proposed rule would require firms operating certain classes of aircraft and airports to 
undertake a number of measures aimed at increasing civil aviation security.  This section of the 
analysis provides a brief description of each requirement, followed by an estimate of the unit cost 
per operator to comply with each requirement.  This part of the analysis also attempts to make an 
initial determination whether the proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.  
Given the operational and regulatory differences between the various firms that would be 
affected by the proposed rule, compliance requirements and their attendant costs are described 
separately for currently regulated aircraft operators, newly regulated aircraft operators, and 
airport operators.  Furthermore, costs are estimated as ranges rather than absolute values in order 
to reflect the uncertainty surrounding different estimates. 
Currently Regulated Aircraft Operators 
Security Programs and Profiles 
Currently regulated aircraft operators affected by the proposed rule would be required to 
submit a profile containing several pieces of information and to develop and submit a security 
program.  TSA would make available to all covered aircraft operators a template Large Aircraft 
152 
 Standard Security Program that operators would have the option to either accept without 
modification or use as the basis of developing their own security program.  In estimating costs 
for this requirement, TSA assumed that nearly all covered operators would choose to adopt the 
template security program.  These requirements would impose costs on currently regulated 
aircraft operators, which are shown in the figure below.  For a more robust discussion on how 
TSA estimated these costs, see the section on security programs and profiles located above in the 
Regulatory Evaluation.

Compensation Low Primary High Low Primary High
a b c d (a x b) (a x c) (a x d) 
$62.43 2 4 6 $125 $250 $375 
 
Security Coordinator Duties 
Currently regulated aircraft operators have existing security coordinators and would not 
incur new costs as a result of this requirement. 
Security Threat Assessments for Flight Crews 
Aircraft operators offering services under existing security regulations must utilize flight 
crew personnel that have undergone a criminal history records check (CHRC).  The proposed 
rule would require LASP aircraft operators to begin ensuring that their flight crewmembers 
undergo security threat assessments (STA) and would limit the validity of a STA to 5 years.  As 
proposed, the STA would consist of a CHRC and a check against government terrorism watch 
lists and related databases.  Existing aircraft operators currently pay an estimated $30 to $35 for 
CHRCs; however, the collection system used by these operators does not include the terrorism 
check component of the proposed STA.  As a result, TSA intends to establish a new system to 
153 
 enable it to process STA applications from covered aircraft operators.  TSA is thus proposing a 
fee of $74 to recover its costs associated with this new system and the processing of STAs. 
Flight crewmembers of currently regulated aircraft operators would be required to submit 
a new STA application upon publication of a final rule if their most recent CHRC had been 
completed 5 or more years prior to the compliance date of the final rule.  Flight crewmembers 
having CHRCs completed within 5 years prior to the compliance date in a final rule would be 
required to submit a STA application once 5 years had passed since their CHRC.  Since TSA 
instituted the existing operator security programs in early 2003, several existing operators may 
need to conduct a STA on their flight crewmembers in the first year of the LASP.   
Because this represents a new requirement, TSA used the full proposed fee, plus 
opportunity costs, in order to estimate a unit cost to existing operator small entities.  As noted 
above, the proposed fee is $74.  TSA estimated opportunity costs would consist of 0.5 hours of 
flight crewmember time to provide the information required for the STA application and to have 
fingerprints taken.  Using an average wage rate of $51.40 for aircraft operator flight crews,40 30 
minutes represents an opportunity cost of $25.70 per STA, for a total STA unit cost of $99.70.  
TSA estimated existing operators each employ an average of 18 flight crewmembers based on 
data provided by TSA subject matter experts and the American Association of Airport 
Executives (AAAE), the entity that processes existing operator CHRCs.  Based on an assumed 
turnover rate of 15%, however, TSA estimated that on average an existing operator would have 
only about 8 crewmembers whose CHRCs would be expired under the proposed rule.  Thus, the 
maximum per-operator cost for STAs would be approximately $800. 
                                                 
40 The flight crew wage reported here is a weighted average of the following occupations from the 2006 NBAA 
Salary Survey: Aviation Department Manager II (does some flying), Chief Pilot, Senior Captain, and Copilot.

Control of Access to Weapons 
Aircraft operators utilizing the TFSSP-AC would be required to control access to 
weapons.  Presently, these operators are required to “apply the security measures in its security 
program for persons who board the aircraft for transportation, and for their property, to prevent 
or deter the carriage of any unauthorized persons, and any unauthorized weapons, explosives, 
incendiaries, and other destructive devices, items, or substances.”41  The proposed rule modifies 
current law by inserting between “unauthorized weapons” the words “or accessible.”  TSA has 
determined this requirement would have a de minimis impact, because few passengers are carried 
aboard such flights and operators are already required to screen them.  Further, operators would 
have a variety of means of rendering weapons inaccessible to passengers. 
Check of Accessible Property 
The proposed rule would require an aircraft operator to inspect, pursuant to the terms and 
method in its security program, any property brought on board that would be accessible to the 
cabin.  Property, for this section, is defined as any container, cargo, or company material that 
may be used to hide a stowaway or explosives, incendiaries or other destructive devices. 
TSA has determined that in most cases affected operators already comply with the 
anticipated inspection requirements during the normal course of the pre-flight check.  Costs 
associated with this responsibility are captured in the security coordinator duties above.  Because 
                                                 
41 49 CFR 1544.202. 
155 
 currently regulated aircraft operators are not expected to incur any marginal costs for security 
coordinators, this requirement also would not add any additional costs for these operators.  
Watch List Matching 
The proposed regulation would require each aircraft operator to request and obtain certain 
passenger information from every passenger on each flight operated by the aircraft operator, and 
transmit the information to an entity approved by TSA to conduct watch list matching (known as 
a watch list service provider).  Any changes to the passenger information prior to boarding would 
be required to be resent to the watch list service provider. 
TSA has estimated the compliance costs for this requirement as the 10-year undiscounted 
cost of WLSP averaged over the forecast number of flights.  This average cost per flight 
multiplied by the average flights per operator produces and estimated annual cost per operator 
for WLSP.  TSA estimates the cost for compliance would range from $245 to $736 per operator 
with a primary cost estimate of $491 per operator.  To the extent that small entities may make 
fewer flights per year than large entities, the actual impact to small entities may be lower.  
However, TSA believes these costs provide a conservative estimate of the impact to small 
operators.  For more discussion on the costs of this requirement, see the section on watch list 
matching above, located in the Regulatory Evaluation.

156 
 Audits of Aircraft Operators 
Under the proposed rule, each aircraft operator must contract with an auditor approved by 
TSA to conduct an audit of the aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program.   
Based on similar audits undertaken relative to other federal aviation programs, TSA 
estimated the cost for these audits to be approximately $2,257 per audit, on average.  Currently, 
audits are performed to review safety, operations, and maintenance.  TSA anticipates that many 
of these firms will offer the “security” audit as part of their offerings to their current customers 
and, perhaps, where feasible, bundle the security audit with already scheduled audits. 
Based on interviews with 3 International Standard for Business Aircraft Operations (IS-
BAO) auditors, TSA estimated costs for audits could range from $1,464 to $3,050.  As stated 
above, TSA adopted the average of $2,257 as its primary estimate.  For more discussion on these 
costs, see the section in the Regulatory Evaluation that describes this requirement. 
Total Cost per Currently Regulated Aircraft Operator 
The following figure is a summary of the requirements and compliance costs of the 
proposed rule for currently regulated aircraft operators.  As described above, TSA estimated that 
between 759 and 774 currently regulated small entities would be impacted by the proposed rule.

Watch List Matching $245 $491 $736 
Audits $1,464 $2,257 $3,050 
Total $2,634 $3,797 $4,960 
  
Given the uncertainty in this analysis, it was difficult for TSA to conclusively determine 
if the proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
157 
 currently regulated aircraft operators.  Although neither the RFA nor the SBA define the term 
“significant economic impact,” TSA attempted to compare compliance costs to average firm 
revenues to determine if the rule would have a considerable economic impact on covered small 
entities.  Unfortunately, this proved difficult due to the lack of revenue data on covered firms. 
As previously stated, currently regulated aircraft operators are likely categorized by the 
Census Bureau using NAICS codes 481211, Nonscheduled Chartered Passenger Air 
Transportation, and 481212, Nonscheduled Chartered Freight Air Transportation.  In 2002, 
according to the Economic Census, firms in these industries earned annual revenues of 
approximately $3.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively.  For a firm with average annual 
revenues in either of these industries, a compliance cost of approximately $2,634 to $4,960 
would not likely constitute a significant economic impact, given that the cost would equal less 
than 1% of annual revenues.   
For the proposed rule to have a significant economic impact on a currently regulated 
aircraft operator, the aircraft operator would likely have to earn annual revenues of 
approximately $367,000 or less.  In this scenario, the highest estimated compliance costs 
associated with the proposed rule would represent approximately 1% of the firm’s annual 
revenue.  
While conducting research for this analysis, TSA was unable to acquire comprehensive 
revenue data on currently regulated aircraft operators, and therefore could not make a conclusive 
determination on whether these firms would experience a significant economic impact under the 
proposed rule.  However, in light of the average annual revenues of firms in the respective 
industries in 2002, TSA does not believe the proposed rule would represent a significant 
158 
 economic impact on a substantial number of currently regulated aircraft operators.  The Agency 
requests comment on this preliminary determination.    
Newly Regulated Aircraft Operators 
Security Programs and Profiles 
As described above, covered aircraft operators would be required to submit a profile to 
TSA and to develop and submit a security program.  TSA estimated it would take newly 
regulated aircraft operators between 8 and 16 hours to review the template security program, 
assemble the requisite profile information, and submit the requisite documents to TSA for 
review.  TSA assumed an average of 12 hours for its primary estimate.  To calculate costs for 
newly regulated aircraft operators to review security programs and submit the required profile 
information, TSA again multiplied the estimated hourly range by the hourly wage of $62.43.   
Figure 73: Unit Cost: Security Programs/Profiles, Newly Regulated Aircraft Operators 
Hours Total Unit Cost Hourly 
Compensation Low Primary High Low Primary High
a b c d (a x b) (a x c) (a x d) 
$62.43 8 12 16 $500 $750 $1,000 
 
Security Coordinator Duties 
Newly regulated large aircraft operators would be required to designate Aircraft Operator 
Security Coordinators (AOSC), Ground Security Coordinators (GSC), and In-Flight Security 
Coordinators (ISC) and ensure they are properly trained.  Each security coordinator position 
would have unique responsibilities; however, aircraft operator employees could be trained to 
serve as one or all three of these positions. 
The principal AOSC or an alternate, if applicable, must be available for contact by TSA 
24 hours a day, seven days a week to ensure the Agency is able to quickly disseminate any 
intelligence of a threat to a specific aircraft operator or industry segment.  The AOSC bears the 
159 
 further responsibility for maintaining any and all records necessary to demonstrate to an auditor 
or TSA inspector the aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program.  In addition to 
these AOSC duties, security coordinators are responsible for the enforcement of policies and 
procedures relative to the security of the aircraft, including the vetting of crew (where required) 
and passengers which must be carried out in accordance with the operator’s security program.  
Many of the aircraft operator requirements discussed in the following cost sections fall under the 
responsibility of the security coordinators.   
TSA estimated the amount of time security coordinators of newly regulated aircraft 
operators would spend on their duties.  For a detailed discussion of these estimates, see the 
section on security coordinator duties in the Regulatory Evaluation.  The figure below displays 
the annual cost per operator of having an AOSC. 
Figure 74: Unit Cost: Security Coordinator Duties, Newly Regulated Aircraft Operators 
Hours Total Unit Cost Hourly 
Compensation Low Primary High Low Primary High
a b c d (a x b) (a x c) (a x d) 
$53.59 164 284 404 $8,780 $15,210 $21,650 
 
Newly regulated aircraft operators would also need to ensure that security coordinators 
underwent appropriate security training in order to carry out their required functions.  The AOSC 
would thus coordinate with TSA to provide training to GSCs and ISCs.  Training would cover 
topics such as procedures to notify authorities when dealing with suspect items, unauthorized 
access to the aircraft, threat notification and response, implementation of security directives, and 
other security related topics.  Security coordinators would be required to complete both an initial 
training course and annual recurring training.  TSA again provided a range of estimates of the 
amount of time newly regulated operators would spend conducting new and recurring training.   
160 
 For the purposes of estimating costs for this IRFA, TSA assumed that an operator would 
need to conduct an initial and recurring training of GSCs and ISCs in one year.  Although this is 
unlikely, the Agency feels that this is a conservative assumption that accounts for the maximum 
potential cost of this requirement.

Unit Cost Requirement 
Low Primary High
New Training $460 $680 $890
Recurring Training $230 $340 $440
Total  $690 $1,020 $1,330
 
Security Threat Assessments for Flight Crews 
The proposed rule would also require newly regulated aircraft operators to ensure that 
their flight crewmembers undergo security threat assessments (STA).  The STA process would 
require each flight crewmember to submit fingerprints, along with information such as name, 
date and place of birth, Social Security Number (voluntary), and other information necessary for 
TSA to determine whether an applicant has committed a disqualifying crime or poses a threat to 
transportation or national security.  For a comprehensive discussion of how TSA derived the 
total cost of this provision, see the section of the Regulatory Evaluation that describes this 
requirement. 
For the purposes of estimating costs for this IRFA, TSA estimated the cost of flight crews 
obtaining STAs on a per operator basis.  Based on input from TSA subject matter experts, TSA 
assumed 1.5 flight crewmembers per aircraft, and 1.8 aircraft per Part 91 operator and 4 aircraft 
per part 125 operator.  The figure below displays the average cost that each newly regulated 
operator would incur as a result of this NPRM.

Control of Access to Weapons 
As described in the more comprehensive Regulatory Evaluation and in the section on 
currently regulated aircraft operators of this IRFA, this requirement is anticipated to have a de 
minimis impact on covered operators. 
Check of Accessible Property 
As previously stated, TSA determined that in most cases affected operators already 
comply with the anticipated inspection requirements during the normal course of the pre-flight 
check.  Costs associated with this responsibility are captured in the security coordinator duties 
above. 
Watch List Matching 
The estimated cost for WLSP compliance is the same for the newly covered and existing 
operators.  TSA utilizes the same methodology as above to estimate the total unit compliance 
cost for newly regulated aircraft operators.  TSA estimates the cost for compliance would range 
from $245 to $736 with a primary cost of $491 per operator. 
Audits of Aircraft Operators 
Under the proposed rule, each aircraft operator must contract with an auditor approved by 
TSA to conduct an audit of the aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program.  The 
cost of this requirement for newly regulated aircraft operators would be identical to the cost for 
currently regulated operators.  TSA estimated that the unit cost of an audit would range from 
$1,464 to $3,050, with $2,257 being the Agency’s primary estimate for the cost of this 
requirement. 
162 
 Total Cost per Newly Regulated Aircraft Operator 
The following figure is a summary of the requirements and compliance costs of the 
proposed rule for newly regulated aircraft operators.  The Agency estimated that the cost of 
complying with the proposed rule would range from $12,259 to $28,356 for newly regulated 
aircraft operators.  As described above, TSA estimated that between 0 and 9,061 small entities in 
this operator category would be impacted by the proposed rule.

TSA again encountered analytical difficulties when attempting to determine if the 
proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of newly 
regulated aircraft operators.  As previously stated, TSA was unable to acquire annual revenue 
data for these operators.  This lack of information prevented TSA from making a conclusive 
determination of the rule’s impact on small entities in this operator category. 
For the proposed rule to have a significant economic impact on a newly regulated aircraft 
operator, the aircraft operator would likely have to earn annual revenues of $2.7 million or less.  
If a firm with this level of annual revenues incurred compliance costs of $28,356 (the high 
estimate in the figure above), it would represent 1% of annual revenue.  Given the uncertainty in 
its estimates, TSA requests comment on whether the proposed rule would have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of newly regulated aircraft operators.  
163 
 Airport Operators 
Security Programs and Profiles 
The proposed rule would require certain privately-owned airports to develop security 
programs and submit security profiles to TSA.  TSA would make available a template partial 
airport security program that operators would have the option to either accept without 
modification or use as the basis of developing their own security program. 
To calculate the unit cost for airports to comply with this requirement, TSA assumed that 
nearly all covered airport operators would choose to adopt the template security program, 
thereby minimizing the cost of implementing this requirement.  Second, TSA estimated it would 
take these newly regulated private airport operators between 8 and 16 hours to review and 
implement the template security program and assemble the requisite profile information.  TSA 
adopted an average of 12 hours as its primary estimate.  Finally, TSA multiplied each hour 
estimate by a middle management wage rate of $31.24 per hour to generate a unit cost between 
$250 and $500, with a primary estimate of $375.  The requirement to adopt and submit security 
programs and profiles is not recurring; therefore, airport operators would only incur this cost 
once over the ten-year period of analysis.  This estimate does not include completion of a risk-
based self-assessment tool that may complement the security program.  TSA has requested 
comments on whether such a tool should be mandatory but has not set it forth as a requirement in 
the proposed rule.

 Airport Security Coordinators 
The proposed rule would also require airport operators to maintain airport security 
coordinators (ASC).  For a more in-depth discussion of this requirement, see the airport security 
coordinator section of the Regulatory Evaluation. 
TSA estimated airport security coordinators would spend an average of between 0.5 and 
1 hour per week on their duties, adopting 0.75 hours per week as its primary estimate.  To 
calculate the cost on an annual basis, TSA translated the weekly hour estimates into annual 
estimates of 26, 39, and 52 hours, respectively.  Finally, to calculate the unit cost associated with 
this requirement, TSA multiplied the anticipated number annual hours by the ASC average 
hourly cost of compensation.  See the figure below.

Airport security coordinators would need to undergo training to comply with the 
proposed rule.  TSA training requirements for airport security coordinators differ from those for 
aircraft operator security coordinators.  ASC training is only offered twice per year by the 
American Association of Airport Executives.  This 8-hour training course is taught by 
professional trainers and requires payment of a $350 registration fee.  Since this training is 
offered at a single location, TSA estimated ASCs would need to expend an additional $450 to 
cover travel and other incidental expenses.  TSA assumed the need to travel to and from the 
training would effectively add an additional 8 hours to the training. 
To estimate the cost of this requirement, the 8 hours of class time are added to the 8 hours 
of assumed travel time for a total of 16 hours of compensated ASC time.  TSA estimated airports 
165 
 would need to train between 1 and 3 ASCs in order to meet the requirements that an ASC be 
available 24-hours per day.  Without more detailed information, TSA adopted the average for its 
primary estimate.  See the figure below for a summary of the costs of complying with this 
requirement.  TSA has requested comments on whether it should adopt a self-paced training 
program for these airports that would reduce the impact of this requirement.  For the purposes of 
the RFA, however, TSA estimated costs for this requirement as it is proposed in the NPRM.

Total Cost per Airport Operator 
Using the estimates described above, TSA concluded that the proposed rule would 
impose a compliance cost of between approximately $2,360 and $4,420 per airport operator.  
The range of compliance costs reflects the uncertainty surrounding many of the variables used to 
generate the estimates.  See the figure below.

After making the estimates described above, TSA has initially concluded that the 
proposed rule would not impose a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
privately-owned airport operators.  In 2002, the latest year for which data are available, firms in 
this industry earned on average approximately $3.8 million in annual revenue according to the 
166 
 U.S. Census Bureau.  The cost of complying with the proposed rule, as calculated above, would 
therefore represent less than 1% of revenue for a firm with average industry revenues.  
Alternatively, if an airport operator incurred the highest estimated compliance cost described 
above ($4,420), it would need annual revenues of less than $442,000 for the proposed rule to 
impose costs of 1% of firm revenue.  Consequently, TSA has initially determined that the rule 
would not impose a significant economic impact on these types of firms.  The Agency seeks 
comment on this preliminary conclusion. 
As stated above, the proposed rule would also affect publicly-owned airports.  These 
airport operators would have to follow the same requirements as privately-held airport operators: 
adopt security programs, submit security profiles to TSA, and designate and maintain airport 
security coordinators. 
Because the requirements for these airports are the same as for the privately-owned 
airports, TSA estimated the unit compliance costs using the same methodology.  As stated above, 
the Agency calculated that the proposed rule would impose a cost of between $2,360 and $4,420 
per airport operator.  Although these airports are publicly-owned, TSA was unable to locate 
revenue information for them.  The Agency was thus unable to compare compliance costs to 
revenue in order to make a judgment on whether the costs represent a significant economic 
impact to these firms. 
TSA therefore requests comment on whether the proposed rule would have a significant 
economic impact on the 68 to 74 publicly-owned small airport operators that TSA identified in 
its research.  Specifically, TSA requests any information that would allow it to compare 
estimated compliance costs to revenues typically earned by these types of airport operators. 
167 
 SIGNIFICANT ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
TSA considered four substantive alternatives to the proposed regulation that would have 
reduced compliance costs for small businesses.  First, TSA considered using the current method 
of watch list matching employed by aircraft operators under the TFSSP and PCSSP rules.  
Second, TSA considered using TSA inspectors to conduct audits instead of TSA approved third 
party auditors.  Third, TSA considered leveraging the Secure Flight program currently under 
development, which would use a web-based application for transmission of passenger 
information to the Secure Flight vetting engine.  Fourth, TSA evaluated the incremental impact 
of raising the aircraft weight threshold from 12,500 pounds MTOW to 16,500 pounds MTOW 
and the incremental impact of lowering the aircraft weight threshold to 10,500 pounds MTOW.  
This section describes those alternatives relative to the proposed regulation.  TSA invites 
comments on these or other substantive alternatives to the proposed rule.   
Watch List Matching 
TSA considered requiring all large-aircraft operators to conduct watch list matching as 
currently done under the Twelve-Five and Private Charter Rules.  These aircraft operators 
currently run their passengers against the No Fly List, which they retrieve from TSA.  The 
proposed rule would require aircraft operators to send passenger information to a TSA-approved 
watch list service provider.  The alternative to the proposed rule is to extend the current method 
of watch list matching under the Twelve-Five and Private Charter Rules to large aircraft 
operators that are not currently required to have a security program.  Operationally, this would 
require that a total of approximately 9,835 aircraft operators have direct access to the No Fly List 
from TSA. 
168 
 TSA has rejected this alternative based on security grounds.  Expanding direct access to 
the No Fly List from 750 aircraft operators today to 9,835 under this alternative increases the 
opportunity for the list to be compromised and would contradict other TSA initiatives to limit 
distribution of the watch lists.  In order to limit the number of entities that have access to the No 
Fly List, TSA proposes to require large aircraft operators to submit passenger information to a 
TSA-approved watch list service provider.  The proposal would reduce the number of entities 
with direct access to the No Fly List, thus improving security. 
TSA Inspectors 
TSA considered using TSA inspectors instead of approved third-party auditors to 
complete the audits proposed in the rule.  Under such a scenario, TSA would need to hire several 
new employees to complete the inspections.  Each operator would complete a TSA inspection 
every other year.  Because TSA would conduct all of the inspections, aircraft operators would no 
longer pay a biennial fee for audits.  This would reduce the primary unit cost estimate for newly 
regulated small aircraft operators from $20,308 to $18.051.  Assuming a “significant impact” is 
1% of an operator’s revenues, this would reduce the number of affected small entities to those 
having annual revenues less than $2.5 million.  Unfortunately, TSA was unable to estimate how 
many operators would be affected by this change and, as noted in the alternatives analysis in the 
Regulatory Evaluation, the Agency requests comments that would enable it to quantify these 
impacts. 
Relative to these alternatives, TSA opted for the proposed plan as the most efficient way 
of applying its limited compliance and enforcement resources towards the objective of increasing 
security.  TSA does not have a sufficient number of inspectors to conduct the requisite number of 
inspections on the large number of operators that would be subject to the proposed rule. 
169 
 Evaluating a Different Design 
The foregoing analysis evaluated alternatives based on changes to particular elements of 
the processes underlying the proposed rule; what follows is an evaluation of an alternative that 
posits a different process for vetting the passengers of general aviation aircraft operators.  
Specifically, TSA assumes that the role filled by the watch list service providers would be met 
by the Secure Flight program.  In the proposed rule, watch list service provider costs account for 
$45.6 million or 2.8 percent of aircraft operator costs.  In terms of total regulatory costs, watch 
list service provider costs amount to 2.4 percent; the remaining 97.6 percent of the regulatory 
costs of the proposed rule derives from procedures that would be unchanged by the introduction 
of Secure Flight into the watch list service provider role.  Among these are the costs associated 
with the security program, training costs, and auditor costs for aircraft operators and airport 
operators, as well as the government costs associated with these processes. 
In the Secure Flight program currently under development, TSA has indicated the use of 
a web-based application for some transmissions of passenger information to the Secure Flight 
vetting engine.  Following that reasoning, this alternative is based on a browser interface of web 
services submission mechanism and proceeds on the expectation that the Secure Flight web 
application will be deployed as the mechanism by which general aviation aircraft operators will 
transmit passenger information for vetting against the watch lists.  This analysis reflects the early 
stage of development and cannot, given this early stage, include costs that may be identified as 
TSA proceeds with system development.  
While the design and development of the Secure Flight web-based application is in its 
early stages, TSA subject matter experts have provided two approaches to extending an already 
170 
 established web-based application to the general aircraft population.  These two approaches, in 
turn, yield two estimates of the incremental costs. 
They key difference between these approaches is the assumption made relative to the 
implementation of LASP.  In the first approach the implementation of LASP does not precede 
the extension of Secure Flight to the general aviation population while in the second, Secure 
Flight follows the implementation of LASP.  Central to this difference is recognition that 
preparing aircraft operators to transmit passenger information to vetting agent and receive 
passenger information from a vetting agent requires a number of tasks to be performed.  Among 
these are, operational instruction (file format, processes and procedures) and testing (beta and 
operational), as well as customer service and support during the initial implementation period.  
Furthermore, these tasks, and the associated costs, will be incurred whether performed by the 
private sector (in the form of WLSPs) or the government sector (in the form of Secure Flight). 
The first approach, option-one, would be developed and implemented with the absence of 
an implemented LASP and would amount to $23.2 million undiscounted over ten years.  This 
approach posits that without an implemented LASP, Secure Flight would be required to establish 
a relationship with each of the aircraft operators.  TSA would work with aircraft operators to 
develop the formatting and transmission procedures for not only for the upload of passenger 
information but also the download of passenger vetting results.  These out-reach or ramp-up 
activities will be borne by the Secure Flight process.  The costs associated with these activities 
are identified in the table below as “airline interface coordinators” and are estimated to amount 
to amount to $3.0 million.

Under this option, the costs associated the watch list service providers as proposed in the 
rule would be removed and in their place these incremental Secure Flight costs would be 
substituted.  Previously, in the Cost of Compliance section, above, TSA estimated the ten-year, 
undiscounted costs of providing watch list matching costs at $45.6 million; these would be 
replaced by the $23.2 million identified in the table above.  TSA has not estimated the cost for 
operators to connect to the Secure Flight web-based application. 
The second approach, option-two, would be developed and implemented with the ability 
to leverage activities associated with a fully implemented LASP and would amount to $11.0 
million undiscounted over ten years.  This approach posits that an implemented LASP would 
establish a relationship with each of the aircraft operators during the initial deployment of the 
watch list service provider process.  During this period both TSA and the watch list service 
providers would work with aircraft operators to develop the formatting and transmission 
procedures for not only for the upload of passenger information but also the download of 
passenger vetting results.  As a result, Secure Flight would assume a relatively mature process.  
The costs associated with out-reach or ramp-up activities would have been borne by LASP and 
not Secure flight, therefore, they are not contained in the table below.

Under this option, the costs associated with the watch list service providers as proposed 
in the rule would be remain and at some point in time the vetting process would be taken over by 
Secure Flight.  Assuming the Secure Flight cut-over took place at the end of year five 
approximately $24.2 million of the $45.6 million undiscounted WLSP costs (those in years six 
through ten) would be removed and replaced by the undiscounted Secure Flight costs (those in 
years one through 5) of $5.9 million bringing the ten-year undiscounted total of the “mixed” 
approach to $27.3.

173 
 TSA has not estimated the cost for operators to connect to the Secure Flight web-based 
application; however, given the sophistication of the firms currently filling this role, the impact 
may not be large.  TSA is seeking comments specifically on this point. 
The forgoing analysis contains several critical assumptions; two among these are key:  
First, the thorough study required to clearly identify and evaluate the costs of developing a 
system to support the extension of Secure Flight to the general aviation, including a web-based 
interface, has not yet been undertaken and as a result there is a significant amount of uncertainty 
in these estimates.  Second, with respect to WLSP costs, the analysis assumes these costs are 
uniformly distributed over time and ignores the impact of the learning curve on the behavior of 
costs. 
Comparison of the First Three Alternatives: 
TSA opted for the proposed plan as the more efficient and effective way of applying its 
limited compliance and enforcement resources towards the objective of increasing security.  The 
use of third-parties would allow TSA to meet its security mission into four important ways.   
First, third-party auditors would increase effective TSA oversight by reviewing each 
aircraft operator’s compliance with its security program six months after TSA approves its 
security program and every two years thereafter.   
Second, given the number of large aircraft operators (approximately 10,000), the third-
party auditor program would allow TSA to ramp up more quickly thereby obtaining the 
assessment of all large aircraft operators more quickly relative to a program that relied solely on 
TSA inspectors, given the associated hiring and training associated with new hires.   
174 
 Third, the third-party auditor program would allow TSA to focus more of its compliance 
and enforcement resources on aircraft operators that are experiencing problems with 
implementing and complying with their security programs.   
Fourth, the watch list matching service providers would provide the needed security of 
watch list matching for passengers on large aircraft and would do so in a timely fashion.  Given 
the security concerns, TSA believes a reliable mechanism for watch list matching for large 
aircraft must be operational without undue delay.  While the Secure Flight Program would also 
provide a reliable mechanism, its development is likely to be several years away and it is likely 
that it would not be available to address this important security need when TSA would be ready 
to implement the LASP.   
Additionally, the GA industry is very familiar with the third party auditor concept as it 
relates to safety inspections.  Many GA operators undergo third party audits each year to comply 
with customer requirements.  The proposal should be easily integrated into most GA operator’s 
existing audit schedules. 
 
Evaluating Different Aircraft Weight Thresholds 
The determination of weight must take into account a number of factors such as the effect 
on international harmonization, existing policies and programs, and the economic effect on the 
GA community.  Discussed below are two alternatives to the threshold weight issue. 
Alternative  1: Lower threshold weight to 10,500 pounds MTOW.  This solution will 
reduce the associated risk and number of unknown aircraft operators by incorporating an 
additional 3,000-5,000 aircraft into a mandatory security program.  This alternative would also 
include a portion of currently unregulated types of aircraft, including large turboprops and 
175 
 smaller jet aircraft.  However, in order to successfully implement this threshold weight, 
significant modifications to existing security programs and new rulemaking may be required, 
which would result in delayed program/rule timelines.  These additional aircraft require TSA 
oversight and place an additional strain on existing TSA resources.  Furthermore, this change 
would require additional international coordination, since TSA would be moving away from the 
globally accepted International Civil Aviation Organization standards. 
TSA estimates the cost impact of option one, in terms of undiscounted annualized dollars 
would add $23.7 million to the undiscounted annualized cost of the rule as proposed.  The costs 
for option one were developed as follows:  TSA assumed that the entire population of additional 
aircraft operators would be newly regulated.  The cost was established for this group based on 
the new operator costs discussed above, in terms of annualized, undiscounted 10-year costs and 
dividing by the average new operators over the 10-year period.  Assuming ceteris paribus, this 
cost was applied to the number of new operators based on flights to provide an estimate of the 
incremental costs to extend the rule to this group. 
Alternative 2: Raise threshold weight to 16,000 pounds MTOW.  This option would 
reduce the number of regulated aircraft and parties by approximately 9,000 aircraft which would 
ultimately decrease the inspection requirements on TSA resources.  However, excluding these 
aircraft would increase the potential risk and could result in higher damage potential.  TSA 
believes that this increased risk and damage potential of aircraft between greater than 12,500 
pounds MTOW and 16,000 pounds MTOW are not justified by the reduction in cost.  
Furthermore, moving away from the common greater than 12,500 pounds MTOW threshold will 
yield the same concerns discussed in alternative one. 
176 
 TSA estimates the cost impact of option two, in terms of undiscounted annualized dollars 
would subtract $26.4 million from the undiscounted annualized cost of the rule as proposed.  The 
costs for option two were developed as follows:  TSA assumed that the population of aircraft 
operators could be described by the mix of new and existing operators as in the population 
underlying the rule as proposed.  The cost for newly regulated operators was established based 
on the new operator costs discussed above, in terms of annualized, undiscounted 10-year costs 
and dividing by the average new operators over the 10-year period.  The cost for already 
regulated operators was established based on the existing operator costs discussed above, in 
terms of annualized, undiscounted 10-year costs and dividing by the average existing operators 
over the 10-year period.  Assuming ceteris paribus, these costs were applied to the number of 
new operators and existing operators respectively based on flights.  These values were summed 
to provide an estimate of the incremental costs of limiting the rule to this group. 
 The costs for this analysis were based on those developed for new and existing aircraft 
operators in the Cost of Compliance section, above; they appear in the table below.

Based on the above discussion and analysis by TSNM-GA technical experts, the program 
office recommends that the threshold of greater 12,500 pounds MTOW be maintained as the 
recognized security threshold weight standard for current and future GA security programs and 
policies.  Selecting a lower threshold weight would improve security because more aircraft 
would be subject to the LASP but would also increase the burden to industry to the point where 
the burden may not be fully supported by increased security.  Selecting a higher threshold weight 
would lower the burden on the industry because a lower number of aircraft would be subject to 
the LASP.  However, with this higher threshold weight, the proposed LASP would not cover 
many aircraft that can cause significant damage if used as a missile or to deliver a biological, 
chemical, or nuclear weapon.  TSA believes that mitigating the potential security risk and 
178 
 damage potential of large aircraft 16,000 pounds MTOW or under outweighs the cost difference.  
Consequently, TSA believes that the weight threshold of greater than 12,500 pounds MTOW is 
the appropriate balance of risk and burden. 
179 
 IDENTIFICATION OF DUPLICATION, OVERLAP, AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER 
FEDERAL RULES 
TSA has identified an overlap between the proposed Large Aircraft Security Program and 
US Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) regulations governing its Advance Passenger 
Information System (APIS).  CBP requires certain aircraft flying to or from the United States to 
submit passenger manifests to APIS for comparison to the watch lists.  CBP’s watch list 
comparison would thus duplicate TSA’s proposed requirement that large aircraft operators 
submit passenger information to watch list service providers for comparison to the watch lists. 
In recognition of this overlap, TSA would exempt from its watch list requirement flights 
covered by its NPRM that also are subject to CBP’s APIS regulations. 
PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION 
Based on this preliminary analysis, TSA has made no determination whether the 
proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities under section 605(b) of the RFA.  TSA requests comment on all aspects of this analysis.  
TSA will make a final determination in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the Final 
Rule.

 INTERNATIONAL TRADE IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
 
 
The Trade Agreement Act of 1979 prohibits Federal agencies from establishing any 
standards or engaging in related activities that create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign 
commerce of the United States.  Legitimate domestic objectives, such as safety, are not 
considered unnecessary obstacles.  The statute also requires consideration of international 
standards and, where appropriate, that they be the basis for U.S. standards.  TSA has assessed the 
potential effect of this notice of proposed rulemaking and has determined this rule would not 
have an adverse impact on international trade. 
 
181 
 UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (the Act) is intended, among other things, 
to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal 
governments.  Title II of the Act requires each Federal agency to prepare a written statement 
assessing the effects of any Federal mandate in a proposed or final agency rule that may result in 
an expenditure of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year by State, 
local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, such a mandate is 
deemed to be a ``significant regulatory action.''  This notice of proposed rulemaking does not 
exceed this threshold for State, local, and tribal governments; however, proposed security 
measures for city- or county-owned airports may nevertheless impose a burden on some small 
municipalities.  The impact on the overall economy does exceed the threshold, resulting in an 
unfunded mandate on the private sector.  This regulatory evaluation documents costs and 
alternatives.  TSA will publish a final analysis, including its response to public comments, when 
it publishes a final rule.

  APPENDIX A: UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
All economic analysis is subject to uncertainty.  This appendix identifies 
important sources of uncertainty in the economic analysis of the Large Aircraft Security 
Program and illustrates their influence on the estimated costs. 
There are four aspects from which uncertainty derives: uncertainty regarding 
inputs, uncertainty regarding outcomes, uncertainty regarding data, and uncertainty 
regarding assumptions used to simplify complex interactions.  This particular analysis 
considers each of these uncertainty factors.  The appendix first provides a discussion of 
the elements of uncertainty simulated in this analysis, followed by an overview of the 
effect of this uncertainty on the 10-year primary undiscounted cost estimate.  Following 
the aggregated effects of uncertainty on total program costs is a discussion of the effects 
of modeled uncertainty on several individual cost elements developed in the regulatory 
analysis.  
EFFECTS OF UNCERTAINTY ON TOTAL ANALYSIS 
Various sources of uncertainty may affect the reliability of the primary estimate in 
the cost analysis section.  Many of these sources of uncertainty can be modeled using 
Monte Carlo simulation.42  The effects of some sources of uncertainty cannot be 
quantified, although those inputs can be examined qualitatively.  The following 
                                                 
42 Monte Carlo simulation allows an analyst to evaluate the effect of multiple and combined uncertainties in 
an analysis.  The analyst begins by identifying key variables about which there is uncertainty regarding 
their precise values.  Subject matter expertise is solicited to identify the parameters and, where possible, the 
type of statistical distribution that would best represent the possible values each variable could take.  Once 
this has been completed, a software package randomly selects values for each identified source of 
uncertainty from the chosen distributions, calculates the associated cost estimates for program elements and 
the total program, and records the outcome.  This process is repeated thousands of times, and with these 
repeated trials a distribution for cost outcomes is derived.  When complete, it enables the analyst to 
evaluate how the individual uncertainties of the identified variables affect the outcome of the analysis. 
183 
 discussion provides insight about the effects of uncertainty on the overall primary 10-year 
cost estimate. 
Sensitivity Analysis 
The proposed regulation would impose new requirements on aircraft operators 
that conduct flights using aircraft having a maximum certificated takeoff weight 
(MTOW) greater than 12,500 pounds.  Some of the affected aircraft operators are already 
covered by at least one of the current security plan requirements while others, especially 
private operators conducting operations under FAA’s 14 CFR parts 91 and 125, have not 
been subject to comparable security regulations. 
TSA subject matter experts were unable to provide enough information about the 
newly covered operators to enable the use of Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the 
effects of this uncertainty.  Nevertheless, because these population numbers drive a 
significant portion of both the estimated aircraft operator and TSA costs, TSA instead has 
conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the final estimate to changes in the population 
estimates over the ten year period of analysis.  The estimated population for Part 91 and 
125 operators used in the regulatory evaluation begins at 9,000 and 61, respectively, and 
this population is assumed to grow at an annual rate of 1.4%.    
Since an important driver of costs is the number of operators (the lion’s share of 
which are Part 91 GA operators), TSA examined the impact on costs of variation in this 
annual growth rate for the number of Part 91 operators.  While TSA does not have 
established data on this range of variation, the distribution can be given a distribution that 
ranges from 1% per year to 1.8% per year, with a mean value of 1.4% per year.  A 
184 
 truncated normal distribution for this value was used, with a standard deviation of 0.001 
and upper and lower bounds of 1.8% and 1% respectively. 
Since most of the aircraft operations affected by the proposed rule involve jet 
aircraft, the number of annual Part 91 operations will be affected by the underlying 
growth rate for General Aviation jet aircraft operations.  The FAA Aerospace Forecast43 
anticipates that such activity will grow at a 5.8% annual rate, and for this uncertainty 
analysis this variable is given a symmetrical triangle distribution, with central value of 
6% annual growth and extreme values of 4% and 8%. 
The most significant source of uncertainty in the cost estimates is the actual 
number of annual operations conducted by aircraft subject to the proposed rule.  The 
major reason for this is that the duties of the aircraft operator’s security coordinator are 
centered around checking on the passengers of each regulated flight, a task which is 
assumed to require 18 minutes per flight for the security coordinator.  The costs of these 
security coordinator duties make up the lion’s share of the total costs associated with the 
proposed rule.  For this reason, variation in the annual number of regulated flights 
contributes directly and significantly to variation in the total cost of the rule. 
Subject matter experts and other industry data were relied upon to develop the 
annual flight count assumptions driving the primary cost analysis, and to broaden the 
available information on this issue, an FAA database of actual flight operations in the 
nation’s controlled airspace was used to develop a profile of annual flight activity by 
operators of aircraft (of all engine types) flying under FAR Part 91 or Part 135.  In doing 
this, it was assumed that the flight services offered by operators subject to the proposed

185 
 rule would be conducted under Instrument Flight Rules, and would therefore be 
monitored in controlled airspace.  All such flights in the national airspace system are 
identified in the FAA’s Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) database.  As 
part of this analysis, TSA used tail number identifications for ETMS flight records to 
aggregate GA and charter flights in aircraft of 12,500 lb. or greater MTOW during fiscal 
year 2007.  These flights were conducted in aircraft with jet engines, turboprop engines 
and piston engines, and to estimate future activity levels, TSA used the FAA’s projected 
activity growth rates for each of these engine types (-0.2%, 1.5% and 6% for piston, 
turboprop and jet aircraft respectively) to grow future flight counts by affected aircraft. 
In contrast, for the primary cost calculations of the cost analysis, estimates for 
annual counts of covered operators and the annual number of flights conducted by each 
operator were combined to estimate annual flight counts.  While based on data and 
assumptions collected from industry subject matter experts, these activity forecasts 
contrast sharply with those derived from the ETMS flight record data for FY2007.  
Figure 87 reports these two flight count forecasts.

186 
 To capture the uncertainty about the actual level of flight activity that would drive 
primary costs for the proposed rule, a random variable for annual flights was created in 
two steps: 
1. A random variable X was created, using a uniform distribution between 0 
and 1.  This means that any value between 0 and 1 is equally likely to 
occur during the Monte Carlo simulation process. 
2. The random variable for annual flights in each forecast year was 
constructed as Annual Flights = [X * (ETMS Flights)] + [(1 – X) * 
(Operator Count Forecast Flights)] 
This construction creates a flight count value for each year that is uniformly distributed 
between the lower value represented in the ETMS-based forecast and the higher value 
represented in the Operator Count-based forecast, depending on the value taken by the 
random variable X.   
 This approach differs from the customary approach in uncertainty analyses of 
choosing a distribution that is centered on the primary deterministic estimate, but in this 
case the Operator Count-based forecast can legitimately be regarded as an upper bound 
for an important driving factor for the overall primary cost estimate.  In this setting, the 
principal interest is in the effect of plausible smaller values for annual flight counts on the 
primary estimate for overall program costs and for other important primary cost 
subcomponents. 
These three input distributions used to initiate the LASP primary cost uncertainty 
analysis are shown below.

Monte Carlo Simulation 
Using these specified distributions for uncertainty in important input variables, 
TSA ran a Monte Carlo simulation.44  The simulation was based on the primary estimate 
of the core cost analysis and therefore uses all of the primary estimate assumptions except 
those explicitly treated as sources of uncertainty for the simulation, which are described 
above  The mean 10-year undiscounted total cost estimate is $1.41 billion.  The interior 
90% interval for these primary total costs ranges between $0.94 billion and $1.87 billion

 – a spread of around $0.93 billion.  Figure 89 shows the full distribution of total 
undiscounted 10-year cost estimates.  Readers should note that this simulation does not 
account for uncertainty regarding the size of the initial population of covered aircraft 
operators, nor does it account for any uncertainty in unit costs for duties assigned to 
operators, airports and TSA.  It does illustrate the sensitivity in total program costs to a 
reasonable degree of variability in the volume and annual growth of activity by the 
dominant share of the covered operator population.

The Monte Carlo simulation also provides information on the correlation between 
the distribution for total undiscounted program costs and the three input distributions 
discussed above.  This “tornado” chart is shown as Figure 90.  As shown in the figure, the 
correlation between total program costs and the modeled variability in the volume and 
growth of Part 91 flight activity is quite strong, at 0.954.   The correlation between 
program total costs and variability in the other two modeled variables is much more 
189 
 modest.  Total program costs, undiscounted over the 10 year period, have a negligible 
correlation of -0.002 with the assumed variability in the annual growth rate for General 
Aviation Jet operations.  Similarly, total program costs, undiscounted over the 10 year 
period, have essentially no correlation, at -0.011, with the modeled variability in the 
annual growth rate for the number of operators who would be covered by the proposed 
rule.

UNCERTAINTY IN INDIVIDUAL COST ELEMENTS 
TSA also simulated the variability in three major cost elements (which contribute 
to the total program costs discussed above).  In the remainder of this appendix, the 
resulting distributions for each cost element are described in turn.  
The most significant cost component for the LASP program is the cost of security 
coordinator duties for covered operators.  These costs are directly affected by the number 
of annual flight operations, which vary with the program elements used as inputs in the 
190 
 uncertainty analysis.  After the simulation, the mean undiscounted 10 year cost for these 
duties was $0.93 billion, with an interior 90% interval ranging from $0.49 billion to $1.36 
billion.

TSA costs for compliance enforcement were also simulated, taking a mean value 
of $190.1 million in 10 year undiscounted costs.  The 90% interval around this mean 
value ranged from $189.9 million to $190.2 million, indicating relatively little variability 
in these costs due to variability in the input parameters chosen to drive the simulation.  
These compliance enforcement costs are the most significant TSA costs within the LASP 
program implementation.

Finally, the variability in passenger opportunity costs due to time spent providing 
personal information for watch list matching was simulated.  As shown in   , under the 
simulation this cost element took a mean value of $60.4 million, within a 90% range 
defined by $32.0 million and $88.7 million.  This cost subcategory distribution is also 
driven largely by the number of annual flights by operators covered by the proposed rule.
