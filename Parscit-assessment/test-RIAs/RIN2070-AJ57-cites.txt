Fueling the future demand for childcare services is the expected increase in the amount of children below 5 between 2004 and 2014. Adding to this growing demand will be an increased female labor force participation rate, forcing families to find alternate care options for their children. Furthermore, many states will be implementing their own care programs for 3- and 4- year old children in the coming years. The government also plans to increase subsidies for lowincome families attending day care programs (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005). While trends point to increased demand for childcare labor, it is difficult to assess whether this will be accompanied by an increase in the number of facilities, and to what extent these new facilities will be located in pre-1978 buildings. 2.2.1.2 Informal Daycare Informal daycare is provided by unlicensed providers, including relatives, friends, and others.

It is possible in some geographic areas for a small number of firms or a single firm to establish a market niche, but overall the market for renovation services appears to be quite competitive on the supply side. The relatively low barriers to entry in the renovation industry enhance the competition taking place within it. Much of the work covered by this rule does not require particularly unusual or high levels of skills. Renovation work has traditionally attracted recent immigrants because a lack of English is not important (Farzad 2005). While any training required as part of this rule will increase the skill level, the cost of the training is expected to be relatively low. There are also a large number of consumers in the industry. As such, no single consumer of renovation services is expected to exhibit influence over the price of these services. There are three sources of substitutes for renovation services. First, consumers can substitute from one contractor to another. Second, consumers can substitute away from professional renovation and into DIY work. This is less likely to occur for COFs than for residential RRP work</context>

The U.S. Census defines improvements as “additions, alterations (renovations, remodeling, etc.) and major replacements.” While not being able to collect data on the number or extent of the individual projects, the Census was able to make some estimations in the non-residential domain, concluding that “about 23 percent of all buildings had some improvement work, while about 71 percent had some expenditures for repair” (U.S. Census Bureau 1999). The collected data, however, were not specific enough to capture improvement expenditures on COFs. Thus, Table 2-22 presents improvement expenditures as the percentage of the total value of non-residential educational building construction put in place in each of the three years for which improvement expenditure data were available.

An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it derives the greatest share of its revenues. These activities may or may not make up the majority of work (i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related (or unrelated) lines of work.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

These activities may or may not make up the majority of work (i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related (or unrelated) lines of work. The analysis identified 8 NAICS codes that are likely to include the vast majority of construction-related establishments that will be affected by the rule.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 60 percent of the net value of construction work and 60 percent of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it derives the greatest share of its revenues. These activities may or may not make up the majority of work (i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related (or unrelated) lines of work.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry. It is likely that only a small portion of these establishments are involved in lead based paint-related training.

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit. 2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year or less.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m The distribution of the number of establishments for all eight NAICS codes is greatly skewed toward smaller establishments. In four out of eight industry sectors, over 99.5 percent of establishments have revenues below $10 million. For the remaining sectors, establishments with revenues greater than $10 million make up less than 5 percent of establishments in any sector (with the exception of the Commercial Building Construction industry where 12% of establishments earn more than $10 million in revenues3).

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry.

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit. 2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year or less.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m The distribution of the number of establishments for all eight NAICS codes is greatly skewed toward smaller establishments. In four out of eight industry sectors, over 99.5 percent of establishments have revenues below $10 million. For the remaining sectors, establishments with revenues greater than $10 million make up less than 5 percent of establishments in any sector (with the exception of the Commercial Building Construction industry where 12% of establishments earn more than $10 million in revenues3).

Establishments with revenues of less than $10 million account for between 30 and 92 percent of the net value of construction work and between 24 and 91 percent of the total value of business done in each sector. It is worth mentioning that if the Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump to 55 percent. Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 60 percent of the net value of construction work and 60 percent of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments.

In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). This figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus qualified for small business status. 2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade school industry.

The small business definition for the ten specialty contractor industries is $14 million per year (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). The SBA size standards apply to firms rather than establishments; at the time the analysis was performed, revenue data in the 2002 Economic Census was only available at the establishment level. Since a firm may consist of one establishment, a few establishments or even a very large number of establishments, by using establishment rather than firm data, this analysis overestimates the number of small businesses in the affected industry. The remainder of this section examines the number of establishments, number of employees, net value of construction work and value of business done2 distribut</context>

As such, the number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of daycare centers renting space, or 17,705. 2.3.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in NAICS 531120 must have revenues of less than $7 million, while firms in NAICS 531312 must have revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). Average revenues in these NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-20). 13 Firms involved in the leasing and/or management of residential buildings are already covered under the residential lead RRP rule.

Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group of interest. The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time during the year are included. Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a). Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment employment numbers by NAICS code. The average employment numbers are small for all affected sectors. Overall, Commercial Building Construction contractors have the largest number of employees per establishment (19.2 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

For both residential and nonresidential building projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs (while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and engineering work, etc). Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations, additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule. Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in place for private preschools (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).14 Both real GDP and the value of state and local construction of elementary school buildings substantially increased over the previous </context>

Expenditures on improvement made up between 35 and 58 percent of the total value of construction put in place in either private or state and local nonresidential buildings in the three selected years, with the data moderately variable.

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit. 2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year or less.

Source: U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m The distribution of the number of establishments for all eight NAICS codes is greatly skewed toward smaller establishments. In four out of eight industry sectors, over 99.5 percent of establishments have revenues below $10 million. For the remaining sectors, establishments with revenues greater than $10 million make up less than 5 percent of establishments in any sector (with the exception of the Commercial Building Construction industry where 12% of establishments earn more than $10 million in revenues3). Thus, about 98 percent of all establishments in the affected industries have revenues </context>

Establishments with revenues of less than $10 million account for between 30 and 92 percent of the net value of construction work and between 24 and 91 percent of the total value of business done in each sector. It is worth mentioning that if the Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump to 55 percent. Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 60 percent of the net value of construction work and 60 percent of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments.

This industry covers child day care centers (including those located in the provider’s home), pre-school centers, nursery schools and pre-kindergarten centers (except as part of elementary schools). In 2002, Census reported that this industry included over 55,000 firms that employed nearly 752,000 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005d).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule Chapter 2 2-12 While Census covers both family and center-based childcare under NAICS 624410, there is reason to believe that Census undercounts the number of employer firms in this industry.

Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group of interest. The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time during the year are included. Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a). Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment employment numbers by NAICS code. The average employment numbers are small for all affected sectors. Overall, Commercial Building Construction contractors have the largest number of employees per establishment (19.2 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

For both residential and nonresidential building projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs (while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and engineering work, etc). Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations, additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule. Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in place for private preschools (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).14 Both real GDP and the value of state and local construction of elementary school buildings substantially increased over the previous </context>

While the Census tracks this breakdown between renovation and new building construction for residential construction, it does not for non-residential construction.

Expenditures on improvement made up between 35 and 58 percent of the total value of construction put in place in either private or state and local nonresidential buildings in the three selected years, with the data moderately variable.

Although 3,223 non-residential property manager and lessor firms are regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule, only a fraction of these firms will perform renovation in public and commercial building COFs requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in a given year. It is estimated that an average of 448 non-residential contractors will be affected by the proposed rule in an average year. 9 In contrast, the analysis of target housing contractors assumes that both employer and non-employer (i.e., selfemployed) contractors will work on COFs in target housing. Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule Table 6-33: Estimated Number of First-Year Non-Residential Contractor Events of certified firms and regulated events given that the number of certified firms is expected to decrease proportionally to the size of the regulated housing stock. These estimates are presented in Table 6-36.

Table 6-37 presents the resulting annualized total and average costs of the Clearance Rule to small non-residential construction establishments.

Figure 2-2 indicates that while there have been some fluctuations in the underlying components of the overall market, when considered over the entire time frame, the number of licensed COFs has been relatively stable. While there wasn’t significant growth in childcare over the 1995-2004 timeframe, a study forecasts growth in the demand for childcare labor.

Section 2.5 discusses the overall market organization for the renovation industry. Section 2.6 describes the residential property owner and manager industry. Section 2.7 discusses training providers. Section 2.8 provides an overview of the structures that would be affected by the revisions to the LRRP rule. 2.1 Contractors that Supply Renovation Services Data from the U.S. Economic Census were used to identify the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry groups that may provide renovation, repair and painting work (U.S. Census Bureau 2004a). An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it derives the greatest share of its revenues.

Nationally, real contract and gross rents barely increased last year.” The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 9.8 percent in 2003. The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e). None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.” The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 2.7 Training Providers Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.

The curriculums offered by these schools are highly structured and specialized and lead to job-specific certification” and these establishments are believed to currently provide training for lead abatement professionals (U.S. Census Bureau 2004p). According to the 2002 Economic Census, there are a total of 3,323 establishments in the U.S. certified as Other Technical and Trade Schools (see Table 2-26). On average, each establishment employs 15.3 people. A striking characteristic is that about 19% of these establishments are exempt from the Federal Income Tax (FIT).

As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors. The Painting and Wall Covering contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction ratio of 39 percent. The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c). It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to covering the cost of materials and profit. 2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year or less.

Because daycare centers are only one of many types of establishments renting non-residential space, and because the rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to 1978, the analysis also assumes that each property manager or lessor firm owns only one regulated building. As such, the number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of daycare centers renting space, or 17,705. 2.3.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that</context>

These 15,753 centers are assumed to be included in the estimated 40,190 elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens. Thus, there are a total of 50,947 pre-1978 daycare centers located outside of elementary schools. According to NCES data on public and private schools, however, an additional 824 pre-1978 schools without kindergartens have a pre-kindergarten program, which brings the total number of buildings accounted for as daycare centers to 51,771 (EPA 2008). 2.8.2.1 Public Schools The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that during the 2004-2005 academic year, there were more than 93,000 public schools in the United States. Of these 93,295 public schools, 52,129 had either a pre-kindergarten (PK) or kindergarten (K) program. The Common Core of Data Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey data was used to calculate the number of private schools with PK or K programs. Using this data, a school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) prekindergarten enrollment was greater than zero students, or b) the schoo</context>

The small business definition for the ten specialty contractor industries is $14 million per year (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008). The SBA size standards apply to firms rather than establishments; at the time the analysis was performed, revenue data in the 2002 Economic Census was only available at the establishment level. Since a firm may consist of one establishment, a few establishments or even a very large number of establishments, by using establishment rather than firm data, this analysis overestimates the number of small businesses in the affected industry. The remainder of this section examines the number of establishments, number of employees, net value of construction work and value of business done2 distribut</context>
