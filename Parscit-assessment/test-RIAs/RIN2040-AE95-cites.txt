For the social cost analysis, government administrative costs reflect the opportunity cost of expending taxpayer dollars to administer this regulation in lieu of other public projects. 11.2 Key Findings for Regulatory Options The following sections present EPA’s estimates of the components of, and total values for, social costs of the regulatory options. 11.2.1 Costs of Regulatory Compliance Table 11-1 presents annualized compliance costs for each of the regulatory options. At a 3 percent discount rate, EPA estimates annualized costs of compliance of $380.1 million under Option 1, $4,461.3 million under Option 2, and $4,630.7 million under Option 3; at a 7 percent discount rate, these costs are $454.6 million, $4,697.6 million, and $4,861.1 million, respectively. These costs include: the direct costs of compliance, the cost of installation downtime as described above, and the administrative costs incurred by complying facilities.</rawString>

<rawString>Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 12: Social Costs and Benefits March 28, 2011 12-1 12 Social Costs and Benefits of the Proposed Rule This chapter compares total monetized benefits and social costs for the three options considered for the proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities rule. Benefits and costs are compared on two bases: (1) for each of the options analyzed and (2) incrementally across options. For more information on the analysis of social costs and benefits, see Chapter 11: Social Costs in this document and the Environmental and Economic Benefits Assessment (EEBA) report. This chapter also satisfies the requirements of Executive Order 12866: Regulatory Planning and Review. Table 12-1 summarizes compliance requirements for the proposed options based on the performance standard each facility would need to meet and its baseline technologies in-place. The cooling tower installation values listed in Table 12-1 are the minimum number of cooling tower installations anticipated by EPA under the direct requirements of regulatory Options 2 and 3. Additional cooling tower installations may occur under Options 1 and 2 as the result of case by case determinations of the permitting authority. Additional cooling tower installations may occur under all options as the result of units increasing their generating capacity and becoming subject to the cooling tower requirement under the new units provisions of the regulatory options. The cost of these potential cooling tower installations for new units has not been accounted for in the social cost and benefits analysis.

The estimated import penetration ratio for the entire U.S. manufacturing sector (NAICS 31-33) is 27 percent. Considering that the United States is an open economy, EPA believes it is reasonable to assume that in industries with import penetration ratios close to or above 27- percent domestic firms most likely face stiff competition from foreign firms.

Thus, for all but one industry (Chemicals and Allied Products), the export dependence ratio is below the average for the U.S. manufacturing sector.

Notably, the Chemicals and Allied Products industry has a low HHI, which suggests that the four six-digit NAICS categories that were classified as having concentrated markets in reality make up a very small segment of the Chemicals and Allied Products industry.

Municipally-owned Electric Generators account for approximately $3.8 million of this cost, and State-owned Electric Generators account for the remaining $5.7 million.

Small and large governments incur costs of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million per facility, respectively.225 Small government-owned facilities are also expected to incur lower costs per facility than the 16 small privately owned facilities, for which compliance costs are estimated to be $6.0 million in the aggregate, or about $0.4 million per facility. Moreover, the largest annualized cost to any individual facility owned by a small government is about $0.2 million, significantly lower than the maximum facility costs of around $1.0 million for large government-owned facilities and $2.5 million for small privately-owned facilities. a.

Source: Economic Census, 2007; U.S. ITC, 2007; U.S. EPA Analysis, 2010 The estimated export dependence ratios for the six industries in 2007 range from 5 percent to 20 percent. The estimated export dependence ratio for the entire U.S. manufacturing sector for the same year is 17 percent. Thus, for all but one industry (Chemicals and Allied Products), the export dependence ratio is below the average for the U.S. manufacturing sector. This finding implies that none of these industries are characterized by strong competitive pressures from foreign firms/markets, and thus market power and CPT potential are not diminished by export dependence.

To the extent that facilities would be able to pass on some of the compliance costs to customers through price increases, the analysis may overstate the potential impact on complying facilities. 4A.1 The Choice of Firm-Specific Versus Sector-Specific CPT Coefficients One method of examining the ability of a firm to pass-through compliance-related cost increases associated with the Proposed Existing Facilities Regulation is to review the firm’s historical performance in passing on previous cost increases to consumers. For example, Ashenfelter et al. (1998) estimate the cost pass-through rate facing an individual firm, and distinguish that rate from the rate at which a firm passes through cost changes common to all firms in an industry, by regressing the price a firm charges on both its costs and the costs of another firm in the industry. The firm-specific CPT rate would relate a change in the prices charged by a specific firm to a change in its production costs, assuming no changes in the production cost for rival producers of that product. However, estimating firm specific CPT rates is extremely complex. For example, in order to estimate firm-</context>

Not surprisingly, previous studies have found that the CPT rate for changes to an individual firm’s cost differs from the rate at which a firm would pass through cost changes that are common to all, or a substantial fraction of, firms in an industry (Ashenfelter et al., 1998). It can be reasonably expected that the higher the share of firms incurring the cost increase, or more appropriately the higher the share of total output produced by such firms, the greater the ability of those firms to pass on a greater portion of those costs to the consumer. In cases where an industry-wide cost shock occurs, an industry-wide CPT rate would be an appropriate and practical way of assessing the potential of all firms in that industry to pass through that cost increase to consumers (EPA, 2003). An industry-wide CPT rate provides an estimate of the change in each facility’s outp</context>

This imbalance stems from a fall in U.S. demand for refined products by more than 3 million b/d from February 2008 to June 2009, at the same time that a minimum of 2 million b/d per year of new refining capacity worldwide is expected between 2009 and 2014 (S&amp;P, 2010c; U.S. DOE, 2009a). However, world oil demand is expected to return to growth of 1.5 percent per year as the world economy recovers in 2010 and 2011, and these conditions should allow the net profit margins for petroleum refineries to return to strong levels within the next five years (Auers, 2009). 7 Crude oils processed by U.S. refineries have become heavier and more contaminated with materials such as sulfur. This trend reflects reduced U.S. dependence on the more expensive high gravity (“light”) and low sulfur (“sweet”) crude oils produced in the Middle East, and greater reliance on crude oil from Latin America (especially Mexico and Venezuela), which is relatively heavy and contains higher sulfur (“sour”) (U.S. DOE, 1999a). 8 Demand for lighter products such as gasoline and diesel fuel has increased, and demand for heavier products has decreased. 9 Reductions in costs resulted from</context>

These products range from commodity materials used in other industries to finished consumer products such as soaps and detergents. The industry accounts for over $630 billion of total manufacturing value added (Bassi and Yudken, 2009). The Chemical and Allied Products industry as a whole is highly energy-intensive. This is especially the case for basic chemicals as well as certain specialty chemical segments (e.g., industrial gases). The industry relies upon energy inputs not only for fuel and power for its operations, but also as raw materials in the manufacturing of many of its products. For example, oil and natural gas are raw materials (termed “feedstocks”) for the manufacture of organic chemicals. However, various technology developments throughout the years have allowed the industry to become less energy intensive; t</context>

Section 2H.7 provides a glossary of key terms used throughout the chapter. 2H.2 Industry Overview This section provides a brief overview of the industry, including descriptions of major industry sectors, types of generating facilities, and the entities that own generating facilities. 2H.2.1 Industry Sectors The electricity business is made up of three major functional service components or sectors: generation, transmission, and distribution. These terms are defined as follows (Beamon, 1998; Joskow, 1997; U.S. DOE, 2000):  The generation sector includes the facilities that produce, or “generate,” electricity. Electric power is usually produced by a mechanically driven rotary generator. Generator drivers, also called prime movers, include gas or diesel internal combustion machines, as well as streams of moving fluid such as wind, water from a hydroelectric dam, or steam from a boiler. Most boilers are heated by direct combustion of fossil or biomass-derived fuels or waste heat from the exhaust of a gas turbine or diesel engine, but heat from nuclear, solar, and geothermal source</context>

As in all competitive markets, prices reflect the interaction of supply and demand for electricity. During most time periods, the price of electricity in a given competitive wholesale electricity market (e.g., an integrated dispatch region) is set by the generating unit with the highest energy production cost that is dispatched to meet spot market electricity demand – i.e., the unit with the highest production cost determines the “marginal cost” of production and therefore the short-run energy price (Beamon, 1998). New Industry Participants As discussed above, PURPA and EPACT set business terms by which nonutility generators – QFs and EWGs, respectively – could enter the wholesale power market. Under PURPA, utilities are required to buy power that is produced by QFs (usually cogeneration or renewable energy) in their service area at a price equal to the avoided production cost of a buying utility. EPACT did not require utilities to purchase power from EWGs. Instead, EPACT gave FERC the authority to order utilities to provide access to their transmission systems on a case-bycase basis.

In 2003, the integrated steel industry had poor operating results, as high raw material costs outweighed increased sales and higher volumes. As a result, most domestic steel producers instituted a raw material surcharge to offset sharply rising costs for raw materials such as scrap, iron ore and coke. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6 percent, and China surpassed Japan, Russia, and the United States to become the number one steel producer (British Geological Survey, 2005). During this period the two different methods for producing steel – integrated (ore-based) and electric arc furnace (scrap-based) – began converging in response to the changing cost balance of raw materials, scrap and energy (AISI, 2001a). The combination of rising GDP, a smaller decline in nonresidential construction, a recovery in auto sales, and rebuilding of distributor inventory is expected to lead to an increase in the volume of steel shipped in 2010 (S&amp;P, 2010e). Value of shipments and value added are two common measures of manufacturing output.13 Change in these values over time provi</context>

Table 2B-3 shows varying trends in the four segments since 1990, but sharp declines in production in all segments except Pharmaceuticals during 2000 through 2001. These declines were caused by the marked slowdown in the U.S. economy, which affected demand in major chemical-using segments such as steel, apparel, textiles, forest products, and the technology sectors (Chemical Marketing Reporter, 2001). Between 1990 and 2009, the Basic Chemicals and Pesticides and Fertilizers segments experienced an overall production decline of 1.5 and 16.3 percent, respectively. While production in the Basic Chemicals segment changed little between 2000 and 2009, production in the Pesticides and Fertilizers segment dropped 10 percent. Between 1990 and 2009, production in the Resins and Synthetics and Pharmaceuticals segments increased 6.5 and 101.4 percent, respectively.

Figure 2B-2 shows PPI for the profiled Chemicals and Allied Products Industry segments for 1987 through 2009. All profiled segments except Pharmaceuticals saw some volatility during that time in response to changing economic conditions, energy prices, and changes in operating processes. For instance, the price jump for the Resins and Synthetics and Basic Chemicals segments in 2000 is the result of an increase in the price of natural gas – feedstock for 70 percent of U.S. ethylene production (Chemical Marketing Reporter, 2001). Price increases for Resins and Synthetics also reflected a shift by U.S. producers away from production of commodity resins to specialty and higher value-added products (McGraw-Hill, 2000). Overall, during 1987 through 2008, selling prices increased for all four profiled chemicals industry segments, especially during the last decade. As the result of the recent recession, prices for all profiled segments except Pharmaceuticals declined significantly in 2009 but are expected to recover in 2010 (S&amp;P, 2010a).

Paper and Allied Products industry manufacturers have exhibited more resilient prices compared to other industries during the current economic downturn (Cody, 2009). Overall, prices for pulp, paper, and paperboard products are expected to increase slightly in 2010 due to gradually improving economic activity and employment levels (S&amp;P, 2010b).

For instance, in 1999, newsprint demand was at its peak but with the advent and growing popularity of the internet, domestic newsprint demand has fallen 57 percent in ten years (Timonen, 2010). However, paper as a means for transmitting and storing information is far from being obsolete. Global paper consumption increased dramatically in the decade prior to the economic recession, and will continue to rise especially in developing countries (Environmental Paper Network, 2007). However, the newsprint industry is most at risk from competition from substitutes. 2A.1.4 Output The Paper and Allied Products industry has experienced continued globalization and cyclical patterns in production and earnings over the last two decades. Capital investments in the 1980s resulted in significant overcapacity. U.S. producers experienced record sales in 1995. In 1996, lower domestic and foreign demand, coupled with declining prices, caused the industry’s total shipments to decline by 2.2 percent. Three consecutive years of increasing demand and slowly increasing prices led to bette</context>

In the later part of the decade, U.S. total Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard export growth outpaced imports, and this trend continued in 2008. However, with a stronger U.S. dollar in 2009, export growth could begin to slow down (McNutt, 2009). The biggest growth in paper consumption is predicted to take place in Asia (excluding Japan). This growth, driven largely by India and China’s rapidly increasing populations and developing markets, is expected to rise dramatically in the next decade (Environmental Paper Network, 2007). In particular, China’s overall paper demand is projected to grow from approximately 60 million tons in 2005 to 143 million in 2021 (RISI 2007). The five largest importers of U.S. paper and paperboard articles from 2004 through 2009 were Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom (U.S. DOC 2009).

The Beverage Manufacturing segment recorded acquisitions and mergers during the last decade, although not nearly as many as the Food Manufacturing segment. Product differentiation is a key strategy for larger firms to increase brand awareness and market share (Yahoo, 2005a). As sales in the United States slowed, firms in the non-alcoholic beverage industry saw their largest gains from non-U.S. markets. In fact, in 2008 alone, PepsiCo had three international deals (Value Line, 2004).

Moreover, the recent downturn in the housing market has been particularly disruptive for this industry. Stagnant new home sales have left saw mills unable to sell lumber products, forcing many to shut down operations. As a result, these closings have caused the price of inputs such as wood chips and kraft pulp to increase. The combination of rising input prices and a sharp decline in demand has led manufacturers to sell their products at a loss thereby reducing the total value of shipments for this industry in recent years (Great American Group, 2009). 5 Terms highlighted in bold and italic font are further explained in the glossary.

However, both net profit margins and return on capital improved gradually from 2004 to early 2007. Since 2007, though, the industry’s financial performance has declined significantly owing to the current recession. Despite many significant obstacles, experts expect that demand for Paper and Allied Products will reach 21.8 million tons in 2011, and that high value-added products will lead growth in this segment as companies search for profit-earning ways to differentiate their product (Great American Group, 2009). During the entire decade, total shareholder returns for the Paper and Allied Products industry, indexed to year 2001, performed at a higher level than the S&amp;P 500 index. However, at the start of the recession in 2008, total shareholder returns began falling quickly back to S&amp;P 500 levels.

Indeed, spending for production, packaging and process control equipment is the most robust automation capital area (see Section 2F.3.5, below). The more advanced technology production equipment requires a more skilled labor force; therefore, the key to future productivity gains are said to lie in better skills training of line operators and supervisors. At the same time, more advanced technology equipment has resulted in more automated production process and has reduced the number of employees needed per dollar of production (Higgins, 2005). Figure 2F-3 presents employment for the two profiled segments between 1987 and 2007. As shown in Figure 2F-3, between 1987 and 2007, employment exhibited different behavior in the two profiled segments.

During the economic slowdown of 2001, however, producers appeared more willing to cut output to prevent sharp reductions in prices (Ince, 1999; S&amp;P, 2001c). As shown in Figure 2A-2, the Paper and Allied Products industry suffered from low prices throughout the early 1990s. The depressed prices resulted from the paper boom of the late 1980s. Prices recovered in the mid 1990s before declining again in the latter part of that decade. Entering the 2000s decade, prices in the Paper and Allied Products industry reversed course and rose, before experiencing declines in 2001 and 2002, as prices for most paper grades dropped between 5 and 15 percent (Value Line, 2003).

The Pulp Mills segment has the highest concentration of the three profiled segments, with a CR4 of 61 percent and a HHI of 1,175 in 2002. Recent mergers and acquisitions have led to an increase in concentration in the Paper Mills and Paperboard Mills segments. In the late 1990s, the top five U.S. firms controlled 38 percent of production capacity, with higher concentrations in individual product lines due to targeted consolidation and specialization (Ince, 1999). The Paper Mills and Paperboard Mills segments also account for most of the production of their primary products. The Pulp Mills segment accounts for a lower percentage of all pulp shipments, with pulp also commonly produced by integrated Paper and Paperboard Mills. As described previously, this period of consolidation in the Paper and Allied Products industry continued throughout the second half of the decade. Containerboard producers have in particular gone through a period of extensive restructuring resulting in a higher concentration of top producers (McNutt, 2009). When more current indu</context>

By 2007, value of shipments significantly grew, prices were at record highs, and labor productivity increased, with the Pharmaceuticals industry segment performing especially well. Beginning in 2008, the Chemicals and Allied Products industry faced a substantial drop in demand due to the economic recession. This economic downturn forced firms in the Chemicals and Allied Products industry to realign their research and development capabilities, marking a shift in companies’ long-term strategies and prompting them to identify growth opportunities in areas such as energy, food and water (Jagger, 2009). With firms using this downturn as an opportunity for growth and innovation, the Chemicals and Allied Products industry should be able to withstand additional regulatory compliance costs without a material financial impact. 2B.3 Domestic Production The U.S. Chemical and Allied Products industry includes a large number of companies that, in total, produce more than 70,000 different chemical products. These products range from commodity materials used in other industries to finished consumer products such as soaps and detergents.

Electric power is usually produced by a mechanically driven rotary generator. Generator drivers, also called prime movers, include gas or diesel internal combustion machines, as well as streams of moving fluid such as wind, water from a hydroelectric dam, or steam from a boiler. Most boilers are heated by direct combustion of fossil or biomass-derived fuels or waste heat from the exhaust of a gas turbine or diesel engine, but heat from nuclear, solar, and geothermal sources is also used</context>

Financial performance in 2004 through 2007 showed significant improvement and steady growth. However, during the current economic recession, the Paper and Allied Products industry’s revenues and overall market value once again decreased significantly, but less so than the overall S&amp;P 500 trend (McNutt, 2009). Throughout this decade, the Paper and Allied Products industry continued to face increased foreign competition, global and domestic overcapacity, and difficulty adapting to changing business conditions (McNutt, Cenatempo &amp; Kinstrey, 2004). At the same time, with the expected recovery in U.S. economic conditions, the Paper and Allied Products industry appears poised to achieve stronger financial performance from this point out. In 2009, the Paper and Allied products sub-industry equity price index increased 134.4 percent, compared to a 24.3 percent increase for the S&amp;P 1500 (S&amp;P, 2010b). Dome</context>

In addition to production downtime, many older, less efficient, single mill operations were permanently closed. In 2001, pulp production decreased 7.3 percent to 53 million tons, while paper and paperboard production decreased 5.5 percent to 81 million tons (Paun et al. 2004). During the rest of the decade, however, the overall production for the U.S. Paper and Allied Products industry remained relatively flat until the recession of 2008-2009, when production of all grades began to decline. 4 Only tissue production remained strong during the recessionary period (McNutt, 2009).

Prices started to level off near the end of 2002, and proceeded to rise during 2003 through 2007. In 2008, Paper and Allied Products industry prices reached near historical peak levels. Overall, following the recession, prices remained comparable to the strong 2008 averages. Prices for many grades of paper trended higher for most of 2008 due in part to capacity closures. Market pulp prices have fallen sharply and quickly in the last year (McNutt, 2009). Paperboard prices have also decreased while prices for paper have flattened out.

There has been extensive restructuring and consolidation in the Paper segment during the second half of 2000s decade, especially for containerboard producers – resulting in a higher concentration of top producers. Boxboard and newsprint manufacturers have also experienced a significant number of closures. Newsprint is perceived to be the weakest subsector of the Paper and Allied Products industry, and may face additional consolidation in the future (McNutt, 2009). Whereas it seems that other Paper and Allied Products industry product categories have merely suffered from volatility in the U.S. and global economy, newsprint and graphic papers have demonstrated long-term decline in demand and susceptibility to closures due to increasing competition from electronic products. Overall, 41 Paper and Paperboard machine lines and 18 mills closed permanently in 2008 (AF&amp;PA, 2009).

The table shows that labor productivity in the Pulp Mills segment has been relatively volatile, posting several doubledigit gains and losses between 1987 and 2007. These changes were primarily driven by fluctuations in value added and production levels. Overall, productivity in Pulp Mills increased by 12.6 percent during this period, while increasing by 65.4 and 51.4 percent in the Paper Mills and Paperboard Mills, respectively. The effect of the current recession on productivity has been mixed, historically speaking (McNutt, 2009). The outlook for worker and capital productivity coming out of the recession is therefore uncertain, but no dramatic movements upwards or downwards have been observed thus far.

However, North American producers have improved production asset quality in the latter half of the 2000s through incremental investment and closure of uncompetitive lines. The median age of paper machine lines decreased by 23 percent between 1999 and 2007. During the same time period, the average maximum speed of paper machine lines increased by 33 percent, the Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 2A: Paper Industry Profile March 28, 2011 2A-15 average width by 35 percent, and the average capacity by 20 percent (McNutt, 2009). It has been suggested that some industries, such as containerboard producers, have been successful enough at matching supply to demand that investment in new capital will be an attractive option for 2010 (Waghorne, 2010). The Department of Commerce estimates that environmental spending accounted for about 14 percent of all capital outlays made by the U.S. Paper and Allied Products industry since the 1980s, and the Cluster Rule promulgated in 1998 is expected to have encouraged increased environmental expenditures (S&amp;P, 2001c).

Boxboard and containerboard producers currently have experienced increasing excess capacity, but still below 2001 to 2003 levels. The market pulp and printing and writing papers sectors have also experienced relatively high levels of excess capacity/low capacity utilization, but this is expected to be remedied by recovery from the economic recession. For the struggling newsprint industry, capacity rationalization has been able to keep supply and demand in balance, but further cutbacks are expected (McNutt, 2009). Overall, total paper and paperboard capacity is slated to expand by 0.3 percent in both 2010 and 2011, with uncoated mechanical paper, tissue paper, linerboard, corrugating medium, and market pulp being forecast as the most successful product grades (AF&amp;PA, 2009).

The Paper Mills and Paperboard Mills segments also account for most of the production of their primary products. The Pulp Mills segment accounts for a lower percentage of all pulp shipments, with pulp also commonly produced by integrated Paper and Paperboard Mills. As described previously, this period of consolidation in the Paper and Allied Products industry continued throughout the second half of the decade. Containerboard producers have in particular gone through a period of extensive restructuring resulting in a higher concentration of top producers (McNutt, 2009). When more current industry concentration data become available in late 2010/early 2011, the industry is likely to show higher concentration levels than indicated by the 2002 data. 3 Note that the measured concentration ratio and the HHF are very sensitive to how the industry is defined. An industry with a high concentration in domestic production may nonetheless be subject to significant competitive pressures if it competes with foreign producers or if it competes with products produced by other industries (e.g., plastics vs. aluminum in beverage containers). Concentration ratios based on sh</context>

In addition, as noted above, the HHI of the Paper Mills and Paperboard Mills segments is 721 and 749 respectively, suggesting firms in these segments have small market shares, which would curtail their ability to pass through any increase in production costs. In the later part of the decade, U.S. total Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard export growth outpaced imports, and this trend continued in 2008. However, with a stronger U.S. dollar in 2009, export growth could begin to slow down (McNutt, 2009). The biggest growth in paper consumption is predicted to take place in Asia (excluding Japan). This growth, driven largely by India and China’s rapidly increasing populations and developing markets, is expected to rise dramatically in the next decade (Environmental Paper Network, 2007). In particular, China’s overall paper demand is projected to grow from approximately 60 million tons in 2005 to 143 million in 2021 (RISI 2007). The five largest importers of U.S. paper and paperboard articles from 2004 through 2009 were Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom (U.S. DOC 2009). Econ</context>

The Paper and Allied Products industry is a major energy user, second only to the chemicals and metals industries. However, 56 percent of total energy used in 1998-99 was self-generated electricity (McGraw-Hill, 2000). The use of renewable resources (biomass, black liquor, hydroelectric, etc.) for energy production has increased steadily over the past several decades, rising from 40 percent of total industry energy consumption in 1972 to 56 percent in 2000. Renewable resource-based energy was estimated to account for about 60 percent of consumption in 2004 (Paper Age, 2004a). Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 2A: Paper Industry Profile March 28, 2011 2A-5 With the slowing of the U.S. economy in 2000, and the onset of recession in 2001, the resulting drop in demand and prices put pressure on companies in the industry to eliminate excess capacity. Through aggressive consolidation and streamlining of their operations, facilities sought to lower expenses through elimination of older and less cost efficient operations. In 2002, paper companies eliminated three million tons of capacity, with similar reductions expecte</context>

Capacity for the U.S. Paper and Paperboard segment declined annually from 2001 to 2003, in contrast to annual increases in capacity for the previous two decades. Capacity declined 1.9 percent in 2001, 1.3 percent in 2002, and 0.4 percent in 2003, and remained largely unchanged from 2004 to 2006 due to increased foreign competition, mature domestic markets, and competition from other media (Paper Age, 2004b). Overcapacity has been a problem within the industry. As the world economy began to slow in the early 2000s, demand in the United States and abroad waned, forcing producers to limit production to prevent oversupply and keep pricing levels from dropping further (S&amp;P, 2004b). In addition to production downtime, many older, less efficient, single mill operations were permanently closed. In 2001, pulp production decreased 7.3 percent to 53 million tons, while paper and paperboard production decreased 5.5 percent to 81 million tons (Paun et al. 2004). During the rest of the decade, however, the </context>

The numbers of facilities and firms in the Paperboard Mills industry segment also declined by 9.3 and 14.7 percent, respectively. Overcapacity in the 1990s limited the construction of new facilities. In 1998 and 1999, alone, 0.6 and 2.5 million tons of paper and paperboard capacity were removed from the capacity base. Over the same period, more than one million tons of pulp capacity was removed (Pponline, 1999). In 2001 and 2002, 8.2 million tons of capacity closed, mostly in containerboard, market pulp, and print and writing papers (Paper Age, 2004c). The number of Pulp Mill facilities and firms has not demonstrated the same level of decline as Paper and Paperboard manufacturers. In particular, in 2004 the number of facilities grew by 13.2 percent and the number of firms by 14.8 percent, suggesting that the Pulp Mills segment could be entering a period of long-term growth. There has been extensive restructuring and consolidation in the Paper segment during the second half of 2000s decade, especially for containerboard producers – resulting in a higher concentration of top producers.

Most products were characterized by weak demand, reduced production and price reductions in 2001, due to continuing reductions in domestic demand (Paperloop Inc., 2001).

To remain competitive, firms in the Food and Kindred Products industry have been able to promptly respond to changing economic, business, and regulatory environment by offering a greater variety of products while consistently and cost-effectively producing high quality products (Rockwell Automation, 2008). Extremely high prices for many food commodities brought a cash windfall in much of 2006-2008 for the industry. However, more recently, the global financial crisis has created new challenges as consumers move to cheaper food options and increasingly cook at home (Plunkett Research, 2010). The industry has exhibited substantially less fluctuation in capacity utilization and financial performance than more cyclical industries, such as the other five Primary Manufacturing Industries. Although foreign competition increased, the industry also experiences significantly less international competition than firms in the other Primary Manufacturing Industries, as indicated by the industry’s lower reliance on export sales and the lower extent of import penetration in domestic markets. On the whole, the Food and Kindred Products industry has maintained a steadily increasing level of capi</context>

In 2009, U.S. total food sales exceeded $1.5 trillion (Plunkett Research, 2010), and the Food Manufacturing segment alone accounts for over 10 percent of all manufacturing shipments (U.S. DOC, 2008). The industry is considered mature, however, and firms are constantly seeking new avenues for increased sales in domestic and foreign markets. With total food industry shipments growing more slowly than GDP, U.S. producers have actively sought growth opportunities in overseas markets. Although exports still make up a small share of domestic shipments, changes in global food consumption could lead to increased demand and trade for processed food products going forward.

The Paper and Allied Products industry consolidated through mergers and acquisitions and has closed older mills during the last two decades as a way to improve profits in a mature industry. About six percent of North American containerboard capacity was shut down (most were on a permanent basis) in late 1998 and early 1999. Companies were reluctant to invest in any major new capacity, which might result in excess capacity (S&amp;P, 2001c). In 1999, new capacity additions in the Paper and Allied Products industry were at their lowest level of the past ten years (Pponline.com, 2000); this caution in adding to capacity has continued through the 2000 to 2010 decade. Another problem for the industry is the increasing capacity being brought online in foreign countries, which could result in higher U.S. import levels and increased competition for U.S. products in export markets (S&amp;P, 2004a). U.S. mills have responded to this increased foreign competition by cutting capacity and retiring obsolete equipment and, with help from private equity investors, have succeeded in constraining supply and improving average product Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing</context>

By 2008, the price of petroleum products was over double the price seen in 2000, the previous peak year during the 1987 to 2002 time period. During the second half of 2008, petroleum industry prices began to decline as the result of economic recession and continued to do so though the middle of 2009. Oil prices fell during 2008 due to a broad-based financial deleveraging occurring across all markets and investment asset classes. The drop in oil prices nearly exactly corresponded to price movements in the collapsing stock market (Protec Fuel Management, 2008). Although world oil prices declined sharply in 2008, they have generally risen throughout 2009. Prices are forecast to rebound as the world economy recovers and global demand grows more rapidly than liquid supplies from producers outside of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In 2035, the average real price of crude oil is expected to be $133 per barrel ($2008) (U.S. DOE, 2009a).

However, with a stronger U.S. dollar in 2009, export growth could begin to slow down (McNutt, 2009). The biggest growth in paper consumption is predicted to take place in Asia (excluding Japan). This growth, driven largely by India and China’s rapidly increasing populations and developing markets, is expected to rise dramatically in the next decade (Environmental Paper Network, 2007). In particular, China’s overall paper demand is projected to grow from approximately 60 million tons in 2005 to 143 million in 2021 (RISI 2007). The five largest importers of U.S. paper and paperboard articles from 2004 through 2009 were Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom (U.S. DOC 2009).

Although these industry segments showed decline in total output, the last quarter of 2009 saw relative production increases from the previous months, and signaled the potential beginning of recovery from the economic downturn. As the economy continues to improve, demand should pick up, with better financial performance expected in the next few years, as long as the industry continues careful management of production levels and control of inventories. In addition, the weakened dollar should help to improve performance in export markets in the short run (Schwartz, 2009). These improving conditions should better position firms to manage any increase in production costs resulting from regulatory compliance. Figure 2A-1 shows the trend in value of shipments and value added for the three profiled segments.5 Value of shipments and value added, two common measures of manufacturing output, provide insight into an industry’s overall economic health and outlook.

Prices and industry profits, which are sensitive to capacity utilization, have therefore become increasingly sensitive to trends in global markets. The U.S. Paper and Allied Products industry has a worldwide reputation as a high quality, high volume, and lowcost producer. The industry benefits from many key operating advantages, including a large domestic market; the world’s highest per capita consumption; a modern manufacturing infrastructure; adequate raw material, water, and energy resources; a highly skilled labor force; and an efficient transportation and distribution network (Stanley, 2000). Over the last two decades, U.S. producers have faced growing competition from new facilities constructed overseas, however (McGraw-Hill, 2000). The 2009 AF&amp;PA Annual Survey of Paper, Paperboard, and Pulp Capacity reports that the average annual rate of contraction from 2001 to 2007 hovered around 1 percent, largely as a result of foreign competition and more recently, the domestic economic recession. However, in 2008, industry capacity declined by only 0.8 percent, and according to the survey, industry capacity is expected to expand by 0.3 percent in 2010 and 2011 (AF&amp;PA, 2009).

Many pulp producers, for example, were not very profitable during most of the 1990s as chronic oversupply, cyclical demand, rapidly fluctuating operating rates, sharp inventory swings, and uneven world demand plagued the global pulp market for more than a decade (Stanley, 2000). The ability of Paper and Allied Products industry manufacturers to withstand recession and react to changing global economic conditions will be critical in the coming years. Net Profit Margin is calculated as after-tax income before nonrecurring gains and losses as a percentage of sales or revenue, and measures profitability, as reflected in the conventional accounting concept of net income. Over time, the firms in an industry, and the industry collectively, must generate a sufficient positive profit margin if the industry is to remain economically viable and attract capital.

(Uutela, 2010). The connection between business activity and office paper demand is eroding as electronic substitution, such as online bill paying, email, internet publications, and electronic readers, become viable substitutes for several uses of paper (S&amp;P, 2010b). For instance, in 1999, newsprint demand was at its peak but with the advent and growing popularity of the internet, domestic newsprint demand has fallen 57 percent in ten years (Timonen, 2010). However, paper as a means for transmitting and storing information is far from being obsolete. Global paper consumption increased dramatically in the decade prior to the economic recession, and will continue to rise especially in developing countries (Environmental Paper Network, 2007). However, the newsprint industry is most at risk from competition from substitutes. 2A.1.4 Output The Paper and Allied Products industry has experienced continued globalization and cyclical patterns in production and earnings over the last two decades.

The number of petroleum refinery firms grew 40.7 percent from 2000 to 2006, while the number of facilities correspondingly grew by 18.1 percent. Since refinery operable distillation capacity is projected to increase by 8,000 barrels per calendar day from 2009 to 2010, either new facilities or increased efficiency can be expected in the next year for petroleum refineries (U.S. DOE, 2010). Most additional new capacity in the United States is expected to be concentrated on the Gulf Coast, with some in the Midwest (Turner, 2006).

The after-tax cash flow (ATCF) adjustment analysis, which EPA undertook to bring the estimates of cash flow forward from the time of the survey (1996-1998) to the time of the regulatory analysis (2008), accounts implicitly for additional regulatory costs incurred through the end of 2008. However, it does not capture the impact of new regulations that came into effect during this period and for which costs had not yet been incurred, or fully incurred, by the end of 2008.

In addition, production in China increased during this period, and although increased Chinese consumption helped reduce the surplus slightly, the country switched from being a net importer to a net exporter. The U.S. aluminum surplus was mitigated somewhat as demand in the automotive and housing markets remained relatively high through mid-2003. In addition, the California energy crisis in 2000 and 2001 reduced production from primary smelters located in the Pacific Northwest (Aluminum Association, 1999; USGS, 1999a; USGS, 1998d; USGS, 1994a; Value Line, 2001). However, as the U.S. economy began to recover in 2003, the aluminum industry saw higher demand levels, but also higher input prices, which contributed to a slight production decline during 2003 through 2006. In 2009, following the recession of 2008, sales and net profits in the aluminum industry were low; however, recovery in the global economy along with a mild rebound in several key markets will likely result in higher demand for aluminum in 2010 compared to the estimated drop of 9 percent in 2009.

In response to declining aluminum prices, the United States and five other primary aluminum producing nations signed an agreement in January 1994 to curtail global output, At the time of the agreement, there was an estimated global overcapacity of 1.5 to 2.0 million metric tons per year (S&amp;P, 2000). By the mid-1990s, production cutbacks, increased demand, and declining inventories led to a sharp rebound of prices. Prices declined again during the late 1990s, however, when the economic crises in Asian markets reduced the demand for aluminum (USGS, 2001e). During 2000, prices rebounded sharply despite the continuing trend of high Russian production and exports. However, economic recession caused prices to fall again through 2002 (S&amp;P, 2001-2004). Prices seen by both profiled segments increased significantly between 2003 and 2007. An increase in global demand, especially in emerging markets like China with cheap shipping and labor rates contributed to price increases during 2006 and 2007.

The number of domestic firms and plants they own declined sharply in 2002 and dropped again in 2004. The bulk of the idled capacity in the beginning of this decade resulted from curtailed production at a number of Pacific Northwest mills caused by the California energy crisis. Most of the smelters outside of this region continued to operate at or near their engineered capacities (S&amp;P 2001; USGS, 2001c; USGS, 2002a). However, by 2007, the amount of idled capacity Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 2E: Aluminum Industry Profile March 28, 2011 2E-9 decreased because new power contracts were obtained by producers, which led to a slight increase in production.

In 2009, aluminum recovered from purchased scrap was about three million tons, of which about 60 percent came from new (manufacturing) scrap and 40 percent from old scrap (discarded aluminum products). Aluminum recovered from old scrap was equivalent to about 35 percent of apparent consumption (USGS, 2010c). Reclamation of used aluminum beverage cans continues to be a major source of supply for the U.S. aluminum industry, generating large savings in production energy costs (USGS, 2009c). In contrast to the steel industry, aluminum minimills have had limited impact on the profitability of traditional integrated aluminum producers. Aluminum minimills are not able to produce can sheet of the same quality as that produced by integrated facilities. As a result, they are able to compete only in production of commodity sheet products for the building and distributor markets, which are considered mature markets.

However, beginning in 2003, both value of shipments and value added for Primary and Secondary Aluminum production segments experienced growth, which could be attributed to an overall increase in market demand for aluminum, both domestically and world-wide. The recent fluctuations seen in the Primary Aluminum production industry segment can be attributed to rising cost of inputs, particularly energy and alumina (USGS, 2009c). Value of shipments in the Secondary Aluminum production segment declined from late 1980s through 1993, and then recovered by mid-decade, before declining again in the late 1990s. As described above, the profiled Secondary Aluminum production segment is comprised of secondary smelting and alloying of aluminum and production of semi-finished aluminum products such as aluminum sheet, plate, and foil. Demand for secondary smelting and alloying of aluminum is primarily driven by demand from semi-finished aluminum products manufacturing firms.

The number of domestic firms and plants they own declined sharply in 2002 and dropped again in 2004.

During 2006 and 2007, imports for consumption increased to more than 60 percent to fill the supply deficit created by increased demand and decrease in domestic production. As domestic production began to increase in 2008, imports for consumption declined, and exports increased, and the United States became a net exporter of aluminum (USGS, 2009c). Between 1990 and 2007, imports in the Primary Aluminum production segment on average grew by more than 7 percent each year while exports and value of shipments declined by nearly 2 percent each year, thereby indicating a continuous growth in dependence of the U.S. economy on aluminum imports and a steady decline of U.S. competitiveness on the world aluminum market. In 2007, the import penetration ratio for the Primary Aluminum production segment was 60 percent, which is more than double the U.S. manufacturing industry average of 27 percent.

The number of facilities continued to rise through 2001, with the largest increase around 1999. This increase may have resulted in part from the advent of minimills, as discussed above. The import crisis during 1997-1998 ultimately led to bankruptcy for a number of U.S. producers, including LTV and Bethlehem Steel (S&amp;P, 2001b). Additionally, seven major bankruptcies occurred over 2002 and early 2003, including Bayou Steel Corp, Kentucky Electric Steel Inc, Slater Steel Inc, and Weirton Steel Corp (USGS, 2004b). Between 2000 and 2006, the number of facilities in the Steel Mills and Steel Products segments dropped by approximately 18 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Nonetheless, the Steel Mills segment saw an overall 43 percent increase in the number of facilities during 1990 to 2006 with average annual growth rate of 2.3 percent.

Import penetration rose to 19 percent in 1994, 1996, and 2000 and reached another peak of 27 percent in 2006, after hovering around 15 percent in the early 1990s. This increase in imports reflected excess steel capacity worldwide and the competitiveness of foreign steel producers, as described previously. Canada received the largest amount of U.S. exported steel in 2007, followed by Mexico. Brazil, China, the EU, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Ukraine were major sources of steel mill product imports (USGS, 2008f). The steel industry’s import penetration ratio in 2007 was 25 percent (compared to the 27 percent penetration for the entire U.S. manufacturing industry), implying that domestic steel producers face moderate competition from foreign firms in setting prices on the domestic market. The steel industry’s export dependence ratio in 2007 was 10 percent (compared to the 15 percent export dependence for the entire U.S. manufacturing industry), suggesting that this industry’s overall cost pass-through potential is not significantly affected by its foreign market sales. The combination of moderate im</context>

Higher demand for aluminum also lead to smelter restarts and substantial increases in primary aluminum production throughout 2007 and the first half of 2008. The recent recession, however, resulted in lower demand for aluminum, leading to significantly lower aluminum prices and consequent production cuts by aluminum smelters. By June 2009, 54 percent of domestic production smelting capacity was idle (USGS, 2008a). Decreased consumption of aluminum in developed economies as a result of the economic events of 2008 could keep U.S. aluminum production below the 2008 level for the next several years. Moreover, relatively high electricity rates in the United States compared to those in other nations diminishes the likelihood that domestic smelters will reopen in the near term (USGS, 2008a). 2E.3 Domestic Production The Primary stages of aluminum production involve mining bauxite ore and refining it into alumina, one of the feedstocks for aluminum metal. Direct electric current is used to split the alumina</context>

Most of the smelters outside of this region continued to operate at or near their engineered capacities (S&amp;P 2001; USGS, 2001c; USGS, 2002a). However, by 2007, the amount of idled capacity Economic and Benefits Analysis for Proposed 316(b) Existing Facilities Rule Chapter 2E: Aluminum Industry Profile March 28, 2011 2E-9 decreased because new power contracts were obtained by producers, which led to a slight increase in production. Domestic smelters operated at 69 percent of their capacity (USGS, 2008a). Because of the 2008 recession and the resulting decrease in demand for aluminum during the first half of 2009 smelter closures took place in Alcoa, TN; Massena, NY; and Ravenswood, WV, and by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009, domestic smelters were operating at only 49 percent of rated or engineered capacity (USGS, 2010c).

Lack of credit to aluminum companies as a result of the recession beginning in 2007/2008 is expected to cause delays in expansion projects in many parts of the world. Projects in places with lower power costs are still expected to move forward (USGS, 2008a).

Alcan acquired Algroup in 2000 and Pechiney in 2004. As the result of these acquisitions, three companies accounted for 41 percent of primary global aluminum output. In 2007, Rusal and Sual and Rio Tinto acquired Alcan, thereby increasing concentration in the aluminum industry. Industry analysts speculate that with a greater degree of concentration, capacity will be more closely managed during varying market conditions, which will likely reduce volatility of industry prices and profits (USGS, 2008a). 2E.4.1 Firm Size The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small firm for Primary Aluminum production (NAICS 331311 and 331312) as a firm with 1,000 or fewer employees and for Secondary Aluminum Production (NAICS 331314 and 331315) as a firm with 750 or fewer employees.

During the fourth quarter of 2008 and early 2009, a number of smelters closed and the price of aluminum continued to decline. Going forward, higher electricity prices in the United States relative to other nations could prevent domestic smelters from reopening in the near term. World demand for aluminum remained low throughout 2009 owing to declines in automobile manufacturing and construction. Overall, decreased consumption of aluminum as a result of the recent economic recession could keep aluminum production at low levels for the next several years (USGS, 2008a).

Consequently, increasing demand for aluminum products during the last decade through the recession of 2008 resulted in increased value of shipments (USGS, 2006a). As discussed in the next section, however, prices for the Primary and Secondary Aluminum segment products dropped in 2009 as the result of the 2008 recession.

Import penetration rose to 19 percent in 1994, 1996, and 2000 and reached another peak of 27 percent in 2006, after hovering around 15 percent in the early 1990s. This increase in imports reflected excess steel capacity worldwide and the competitiveness of foreign steel producers, as described previously. Canada received the largest amount of U.S. exported steel in 2007, followed by Mexico. Brazil, China, the EU, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Ukraine were major sources of steel mill product imports (USGS, 2008f). The steel industry’s import penetration ratio in 2007 was 25 percent (compared to the 27 percent penetration for the entire U.S. manufacturing industry), implying that domestic steel producers face moderate competition from foreign firms in setting prices on the domestic market. The steel industry’s export dependence ratio in 2007 was 10 percent (compared to the 15 percent export dependence for the entire U.S. manufacturing industry), suggesting that this industry’s overall cost pass-through potential is not significantly affected by its foreign market sales. The combination of moderate im</context>

The recent recession, however, resulted in lower demand for aluminum, leading to significantly lower aluminum prices and consequent production cuts by aluminum smelters.

Import penetration rose to 19 percent in 1994, 1996, and 2000 and reached another peak of 27 percent in 2006, after hovering around 15 percent in the early 1990s. This increase in imports reflected excess steel capacity worldwide and the competitiveness of foreign steel producers, as described previously. Canada received the largest amount of U.S. exported steel in 2007, followed by Mexico. Brazil, China, the EU, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, and Ukraine were major sources of steel mill product imports (USGS, 2008f). The steel industry’s import penetration ratio in 2007 was 25 percent (compared to the 27 percent penetration for the entire U.S. manufacturing industry), implying that domestic steel producers face moderate competition from foreign firms in setting prices on the domestic market. The steel industry’s export dependence ratio in 2007 was 10 percent (compared to the 15 percent export dependence for the entire U.S. manufacturing industry), suggesting that this industry’s overall cost pass-through potential is not significantly affected by its foreign market sales. The combination of moderate im</context>

Higher demand for aluminum also lead to smelter restarts and substantial increases in primary aluminum production throughout 2007 and the first half of 2008. The recent recession, however, resulted in lower demand for aluminum, leading to significantly lower aluminum prices and consequent production cuts by aluminum smelters. By June 2009, 54 percent of domestic production smelting capacity was idle (USGS, 2008a).

In addition, production in China increased during this period, and although increased Chinese consumption helped reduce the surplus slightly, the country switched from being a net importer to a net exporter. The U.S. aluminum surplus was mitigated somewhat as demand in the automotive and housing markets remained relatively high through mid-2003. In addition, the California energy crisis in 2000 and 2001 reduced production from primary smelters located in the Pacific Northwest (Aluminum Association, 1999; USGS, 1999a; USGS, 1998d; USGS, 1994a; Value Line, 2001). However, as the U.S. economy began to recover in 2003, the aluminum industry saw higher demand levels, but also higher input prices, which contributed to a slight production decline during 2003 through 2006. In 2009, following the recession of 2008, sales and net profits in the aluminum industry were low; however, recovery in the global economy along with a mild rebound in several key markets will likely result in higher demand for aluminum in 2010 compared to the estimated drop of 9 percent in 2009. In particular, industry analysts expect that U.S. construction spending will increase 1.7 pe</context>

Through aggressive consolidation and streamlining of their operations, facilities sought to lower expenses through elimination of older and less cost efficient operations. In 2002, paper companies eliminated three million tons of capacity, with similar reductions expected in 2003 (Value Line, 2003).

As shown in Figure 2A-2, the Paper and Allied Products industry suffered from low prices throughout the early 1990s. The depressed prices resulted from the paper boom of the late 1980s. Prices recovered in the mid 1990s before declining again in the latter part of that decade. Entering the 2000s decade, prices in the Paper and Allied Products industry reversed course and rose, before experiencing declines in 2001 and 2002, as prices for most paper grades dropped between 5 and 15 percent (Value Line, 2003). Faced with substantial declines in demand during those years, producers cut production, endured downtime, and closed less efficient facilities to prevent major price declines for paper products (S&amp;P, 2001c). Prices started to level off near the end of 2002, and proceeded to rise during 2003 through 2007. In 2008, Paper and Allied Products industry prices reached near historical peak levels. Overall, following the recession, prices remained comparable to the strong 2008 averages. Prices for many grades of paper trended higher for most of 2008 due in part to capacity closures.

The Beverage Manufacturing segment recorded acquisitions and mergers during the last decade, although not nearly as many as the Food Manufacturing segment. Product differentiation is a key strategy for larger firms to increase brand awareness and market share (Yahoo, 2005a). As sales in the United States slowed, firms in the non-alcoholic beverage industry saw their largest gains from non-U.S. markets. In fact, in 2008 alone, PepsiCo had three international deals (Value Line, 2004). In the alcoholic beverage sub-segment, Anheuser-Busch lost the rank of world’s largest brewer due to the merger of Inbrew and Brazil’s Ambev. The merger between Adolph Coors and Molson further consolidated the industry. Brewers began to look for acquisitions in China, which is seen as an untapped market. Constellation Brands purchased the Robert Mondavi Corporation, a leader in wine making, and began to work in a joint venture with the French vintner Domaines Barons de Rothschild.

Through the early 1990s, refiners faced declining prices due to the effects of the 1991 recession and weak demand before rebounding somewhat in the mid 1990s. Prices fell in 1998 as a massive oversupply of petroleum products coupled with decreased demand led to significant drops in petroleum prices. As the subsequent production cutbacks took hold and the glut of supply dwindled, prices recovered in 1999 and 2000, as shown in Figure 2C-2. The higher prices reflect low refinery product inventories and higher crude oil input prices (Value Line, 2010). Excess supply, the global recession, impacts from 9/11, and the relatively warm winter of 2001-2002 led to decreases in prices in subsequent years (U.S. DOE, 2004). During 2003 to 2008, however, prices rose dramatically. By 2008, the price of petroleum products was over double the price seen in 2000, the previous peak year during the 1987 to 2002 time period. During the second half of 2008, petroleum industry prices began to decline as the result of economic recession and continued to do so though the middle of 2009.

A well-defined market requires the inclusion of all competitors and the exclusion of all non-competitors. Defining the relevant market too narrowly overstates market power, while defining the market too broadly would underestimate it. The four-digit SIC category and six-digit NAICS, while not a perfect delineation, is most often used by industrial organization economists in their studies because, among publicly available data sources, these industries appear to correspond most closely to economic markets (Waldman &amp; Jensen, 1997). Therefore, in Table 4A-2 below, industry concentration data is presented for each of the six-digit NAICS codes that include at least one potentially regulated manufacturing facility for which DQ data are available. As shown in Table 4A-2, based on their HHI, 20 six-digit NAICS markets104 can be classified as unconcentrated, five can be classified as moderately concentrated, and only six can be classified as concentrated. Notably, four out of six six-digit NAICS categories listed as being concentrated belong to the Chemicals and Allied Products industry; the other two sectors are in Aluminum </context>

For example, even though the Petroleum Refining and Food and Kindred Products industries have extremely low export dependence, the low market concentration in these industries leads EPA to believe that market power held by individual firms is likely to be quite small. 4A.2.4 Long-Term Industry Growth An industry’s competitiveness and the ability of firms to engage in price competition are likely to differ between declining and growing industries. Most studies have found that recent growth in revenue is positively related to profitability (Waldman &amp; Jensen, 1997), which suggests a greater ability to recover costs fully. To examine trends in long-term growth for each of the six industry sectors considered in this analysis, EPA estimated the average annual growth rate in the constant dollar value of shipments between 1989 and 2007 for each industry using data available from the U.S. Bureau of Census.105 EPA expects firms in sectors with higher growth rates to be better positioned to pass through compliance costs rather than being forced to absorb such cost increases in order to retain market share and revenue.

Increased production quotas by OPEC, increased production from Iraq through the “oil-for-food” program, weak demand in Asia due to their financial crisis, and a warm winter in the U.S. all increased the supply of petroleum products (U.S. DOE, 1999c). Estimates of worldwide petroleum supply exceeding demand during 1998 range from 1.47 millions barrels per day to 2.4 million barrels per day (World Oil, 1999).

Domestic demand for paper and paperboard products is expected to increase as the economy rebounds as the result of large government stimulus packages, inventory rebuilding by end users, and competitiveness of paper in certain markets. Overall world paper and paperboard usage is expected to return to solid growth in 2010 to 2011, reaching 396 million tons in 2011, which is 3 million tons above the prerecession value. Much of this world demand growth will be fueled by strong economic development and a rising middle class in developing countries, lead by China (Young, 2009). This should position businesses that potentially within the scope of the Existing Facilities Rule to withstand additional regulatory compliance costs without having a significant financial impact. 2A.1.3 Domestic Production The Paper and Allied Products industry is one of the top ten U.S. manufacturing industries; the larger forest products industry, which includes the paper and allied products subsector, accounts for approximately 5 percent of the nation’s GDP (AF&amp;PA, 2009).
