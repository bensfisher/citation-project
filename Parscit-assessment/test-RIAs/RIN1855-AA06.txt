Purpose of Program: The Investing in 
Innovation Fund, established under 
section 14007 of the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), 
provides funding to support (1) LEAs, 
and (2) nonprofit organizations in 
partnership with (a) one or more LEAs 
or (b) a consortium of schools (as 
defined in this notice). The purpose of 
the program is to provide competitive 
grants to applicants with a record of 
improving student achievement, in 
order to expand the implementation of, 
and investment in, innovative practices 
that are demonstrated to have an impact 
on improving student achievement or 
student growth (as defined in this 
notice) for high-need students (as 
defined in this notice), as well as to 
promote school readiness, close 
achievement gaps, decrease dropout 
rates, increase high school graduation 
rates, and improve teacher and school 
leader effectiveness. 
These grants will (1) allow eligible 
entities to expand and develop their 
work so that their work can serve as 
models of best practices, (2) allow 
eligible entities to work in partnership 
with the private sector and the 
philanthropic community, and (3) 
identify and document best practices 
that can be shared and taken to scale 
based on demonstrated success. 
Program Authority: American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, 
Division A, Section 14007, Public Law 
No. 111–5. 
Background 
The Statutory Context 
On February 17, 2009, President 
Obama signed into law the ARRA (Pub. 
L. 111–5), historic legislation designed 
to stimulate the economy, support job 
creation, and invest in critical sectors, 
including education. The ARRA lays the 
foundation for education reform by 
supporting investments in innovative 
strategies that are most likely to lead to 
improved results for students, long-term 
gains in school and LEA capacity for 
success, and increased productivity and 
effectiveness. 
The ARRA provides $98.2 billion to 
the Department for direct expenditures 
on education. Within this amount, $650 
million was authorized and 
appropriated for the Investing in 
Innovation Fund (referred to as the 
‘‘Innovation Fund’’ in the ARRA), for a 
competitive grant program to enable 
LEAs and nonprofit organizations with 
a record of improving kindergarten- 
through-grade-12 (K–12) student 
achievement to: expand their work; 
identify, document, and share best 
practices; and take successful practices 
to scale. 
Education Reform Areas 
One of the overall goals of the ARRA 
is to improve student achievement 
through school improvement and 
reform. Within the context of the ARRA, 
the Investing in Innovation Fund 
focuses on four key assurances, or 
education reform areas, that will help 
achieve this goal: (1) Improvements in 
teacher effectiveness and ensuring that 
all schools have effective teachers, (2) 
gathering information to improve 
student learning, teacher performance, 
and college and career readiness 
through enhanced data systems, (3) 
progress toward college- and career- 
ready standards and rigorous 
assessments, and (4) improving 
achievement in low-performing schools 
through intensive support and effective 
interventions. 
Overview of the Investing in Innovation 
Fund 
The Department intends to use the 
Investing in Innovation Fund to support 
the overarching ARRA goal of 
improving student achievement by 
aligning four of the priorities proposed 
in this notice directly with the four 
ARRA reform areas. In this notice we 
propose four additional priorities that 
are aligned with other Department 
reform goals in the areas of early 
learning, college access, students with 
disabilities and limited English 
proficient students, and rural LEAs. 
Finally, we propose to require that all 
funded projects provide educational or 
other services to support high-need 
students. 
In this notice, the Department 
proposes to award three types of grants 
within the Investing in Innovation

Fund: ‘‘Scale-up’’ grants, ‘‘Validation’’ 
grants, and ‘‘Development’’ grants. We 
have defined each of these types of 
grants in the section that follows. 
Projects funded under each of the 
three types of grants would provide 
services to high-need students and 
would focus on priorities directly tied to 
the reform areas of the ARRA; 
applicants could also choose to meet the 
additional priority areas. Among the 
three grant types, there would be 
differences in terms of the evidence that 
an applicant would be required to 
submit in support of its proposed 
project; the expectations for scaling up 
successful projects during or after the 
grant period, either directly or through 
partners; and the funding that a 
successful applicant would receive. 
The intent of these requirements is to 
ensure that program funds are used to 
expand and take to scale the most 
promising practices, strategies, and 
programs. We are proposing definitions 
and criteria that would be used to 
evaluate the available evidence 
supporting a proposed project, in terms 
of the strength of the research, the 
significance of the effect, and the 
magnitude of the effect for each type of 
grant. As such, we are particularly 
interested in receiving comments on 
these proposed definitions and selection 
criteria, and whether, in evaluating the 
magnitude of the effect, we should 
specify a minimum effect size and, if so, 
what that effect size should be. We also 
are interested in your comments on how 
to ensure that projects that are 
innovative and comprehensive in scope 
or that may show a cumulative effect 
over time are properly considered, given 
the proposed definitions and selection 
criteria. We are cognizant of the need to 
balance our interest in innovation with 
the importance of research-based 
evidence, and welcome comments on 
how best to achieve the proper balance. 
We also are interested in receiving 
comments on the criteria we are 
proposing to evaluate the cost- 
effectiveness of a proposed practice, 
strategy, or program. We believe that an 
important aspect of evaluating 
applications under the Investing in 
Innovation Fund is assessing the extent 
to which a proposal is feasible and can 
be brought to scale in a cost-effective 
manner. So that we can judge the cost- 
effectiveness of a proposed project, we 
propose that applicants provide 
estimated start-up and operating costs 
per student (including indirect costs) for 
reaching the total number of students 
proposed to be served by the project, as 
well as for the applicant or others to 
reach 100,000, 250,000, and 500,000 
students for Development grants and 
Validation grants; and to reach 100,000, 
500,000, and 1,000,000 students for 
Scale-up grants. We are interested in 
your comments on whether there are 
other methods of determining cost- 
effectiveness that would be more 
informative or less burdensome. 
Following is an overview of the three 
types of grants we are proposing to 
award: 
1. Scale-up grants would provide 
funding to scale up practices, strategies, 
or programs for which there is strong 
evidence (as defined in this notice) that 
the proposed practice, strategy, or 
program will have a statistically 
significant effect on improving student 
achievement or student growth, closing 
achievement gaps, decreasing dropout 
rates, or increasing high school 
graduation rates, and that the effect of 
implementing the proposed practice, 
strategy, or program will be substantial 
and important. We also propose that an 
applicant for a Scale-up grant could 
demonstrate success through an 
intermediate variable directly correlated 
with these outcomes, such as teacher or 
school leader effectiveness or 
improvements in school climate. 
We further propose that an applicant 
for a Scale-up grant estimate the number 
of students to be reached by the 
proposed project and provide evidence 
of its capacity to reach the proposed 
number of students during the course of 
the grant. In addition, we propose that 
an applicant for a Scale-up grant 
provide evidence of its capacity (e.g., in 
terms of qualified personnel, financial 
resources, management capacity) to 
scale up to a State, regional, or national 
level (as defined in this notice), working 
directly or through partners either 
during or following the end of the grant 
period. We recognize that LEAs are not 
typically responsible for taking to scale 
their practices, strategies, or programs to 
other LEAs and States. Applicants can 
and should partner with others (e.g., 
service centers, State educational 
agencies, institutions of higher 
education) to disseminate and take to 
scale their effective practices, strategies, 
and programs. 
Successful applicants for Scale-up 
grants would receive larger levels of 
funding than successful applicants for 
Validation or Development grants. 
2. Validation grants would provide 
funding to support practices, strategies, 
or programs that show promise, but for 
which there is currently only moderate 
evidence (as defined in this notice) that 
the proposed practice, strategy, or 
program will have a statistically 
significant effect on improving student 
achievement or student growth, closing 
achievement gaps, decreasing dropout 
rates, or increasing high school 
graduation rates, and that with further 
study, the effect of implementing the 
proposed practice, strategy, or program 
may prove to be substantial and 
important. Thus, proposals for 
Validation grants would not need to 
have the same level of research evidence 
to support the proposed project that 
would be required for Scale-up grants. 
We also propose that applicants could 
demonstrate success through an 
intermediate variable directly correlated 
with these outcomes, such as teacher or 
school leader effectiveness or 
improvements in school climate. 
An applicant for a Validation grant 
would have to estimate the number of 
students to be reached by the proposed 
project and provide evidence of its 
capacity to reach the proposed number 
of students during the course of the 
grant. In addition, we propose that an 
applicant for a Validation grant provide 
evidence of its capacity (e.g., in terms of 
qualified personnel, financial resources, 
management capacity) to scale up to a 
State or regional level, working directly 
or through partners either during or 
following the end of the grant period. As 
noted earlier, we recognize that LEAs 
are not typically responsible for taking 
to scale their practices, strategies, or 
programs to other LEAs and States. 
Applicants can and should partner with 
others to disseminate and take to scale 
their effective practices, strategies, and 
programs. 
Successful applicants for Validation 
grants would receive more funding than 
successful applicants for Development 
grants. 
3. Development grants would provide 
funding to support new, high-potential, 
and relatively untested practices, 
strategies, or programs whose efficacy 
should be systematically studied. An 
applicant would have to provide 
evidence that the proposed practice, 
strategy, or program, or one similar to it, 
has been attempted previously, albeit on 
a limited scale or in a limited setting, 
and yielded promising results that 
suggest that more formal and systematic 
study is warranted. An applicant must 
provide a rationale for the proposed 
practice, strategy, or program that is 
based on research findings or reasonable 
hypotheses, including related research 
or theories in education and other 
sectors. Thus, proposals for 
Development grants would not need to 
provide the same level of evidence to 
support the proposed project that would 
be required for Validation or Scale-up 
grants. 
We also propose that an applicant for 
a Validation grant estimate the number 
of students to be served by the project,

and provide evidence of its ability to 
implement and appropriately evaluate 
the proposed project and, if positive 
results are obtained, its capacity (e.g., in 
terms of qualified personnel, financial 
resources, management capacity) to 
further develop and bring the project to 
a larger scale directly or through 
partners either during or following the 
end of the grant period. As noted earlier, 
we recognize that LEAs are not typically 
responsible for taking to scale their 
practices, strategies, or programs. 
Applicants can and should partner with 
others to disseminate and take to scale 
their effective practices, strategies, and 
programs. 
To summarize, in terms of the 
evidence required to support the 
proposed practice, strategy, or program, 
the major differences between Scale-up, 
Validation, and Development grants are 
(see Table 1): (1) The strength of the 
research; (2) the significance of the 
effect; and (3) the magnitude of the 
effect.

In addition, the three types of grants 
differ in terms of the expectations to

either directly or through partners, and 
the level of funding that would be 
available. (See Table 2). 
It is our intent to make one or more 
awards for each type of grant (Scale-up, 
Validation, Development), assuming 
that we receive applications for each 
type of grant that are of sufficient 
quality. We will announce specific 
funding ranges for each type of grant in

Proposed Priorities 
Types of Priorities 
The Secretary proposes eight 
priorities for the Investing in Innovation 
Fund. Proposed Priorities 1, 2, 3, and 4 
are proposed as absolute priorities and 
are aligned with the four reform areas 
under the ARRA; all applicants must 
apply under one of these four priorities. 
Proposed Priorities 5, 6, 7, and 8 are 
proposed as competitive preference 
priorities and are aligned with other key 
education reform goals of the 
Department. We may apply one or more 
of the competitive preference priorities 
to one or more of the three types of 
grants (Scale-up, Validation, 
Development grants). 
We may choose, in the notice of final 
priorities, requirements, definitions, and 
selection criteria, to change the 
designation of any of these priorities to 
absolute, competitive preference, or 
invitational priorities, or to include the 
substance of these priorities in the 
selection criteria. 
Under an absolute priority, as 
specified by 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), we 
would consider only applications that 
meet the priority. Under a competitive 
preference priority, we would give 
competitive preference to an application 
by (1) awarding additional points, 
depending on the extent to which the 
application meets the priority (34 CFR 
75.105(c)(2)(i)); or (2) selecting an 
application that meets the priority over 
an application of comparable merit that 
does not meet the priority (34 CFR 
75.105(c)(2)(ii)). With an invitational 
priority, we would signal our interest in 
receiving applications that meet the 
priority; however, consistent with 34 
CFR 75.105(c)(1), we would not give an 
application that meets an invitational 
priority preference over other 
applications. 
Proposed Absolute Priorities 
Proposed Absolute Priority 1— 
Innovations That Support Effective 
Teachers and School Leaders 
Background. Research indicates that 
teacher quality is a critical contributor 
to student learning.1 Yet we know that 
there is dramatic variation in teacher 
effectiveness across schools and LEAs, 
as well as inequity in the distribution of 
effective teachers between high- and 
low-poverty schools. We also know that 
it is difficult to predict teacher 
effectiveness based on the qualifications 
that teachers bring to the job.2 
Furthermore, studies show that school 
leadership is a major contributing factor 
to what students learn at school and that 
strong teachers are more likely to teach 
in schools with strong principals.3 
Absolute priority 1 is intended to 
support projects that promote practices, 
strategies, or programs to increase the 
number and percentage of effective 
teachers and school leaders, or help 
reduce the inequities in the distribution 
of effective teachers and school leaders.

4 See, e.g., The Data Quality Campaign at 
http://www.dataqualitycampaign.org/using-data- 
systems/roadmap-for-states. 
It is also designed to encourage the use 
of teacher and school leader evaluation 
systems that are tied to student growth. 
Statement of the Proposed Absolute 
Priority. Under proposed absolute 
priority 1, the Department would 
provide funding to support practices, 
strategies, or programs that increase the 
number or percentages of highly 
effective teachers and school leaders or 
reduce the number or percentages of 
ineffective teachers and school leaders, 
especially for high-need students, by 
identifying, recruiting, developing, 
placing, rewarding, and retaining highly 
effective teachers and school leaders (or 
removing ineffective teachers and 
school leaders). In such initiatives, 
teacher or school leader effectiveness 
should be determined by an evaluation 
system that is rigorous, transparent, and 
fair; performance should be 
differentiated using multiple rating 
categories of effectiveness; multiple 
measures of teachers’ effectiveness 
should be taken into account, with data 
on student growth as a significant factor; 
and the measures should be designed 
and developed with teacher 
involvement. 
Proposed Absolute Priority 2— 
Innovations That Improve the Use of 
Data 
Background. Section 14005(d)(3) of 
the ARRA requires States receiving State 
Fiscal Stabilization funds to establish a 
longitudinal data system that includes 
the elements described in section 
6401(e)(2) of the America COMPETES 
Act (20 U.S.C. 9871). Providing student 
achievement or student growth data to 
teachers and principals, including 
estimates of individual teacher impact 
on student achievement or student 
growth, is key to driving education 
reform in general and improvements in 
the classroom, in particular.4 This 
priority is designed to increase the 
availability and use of practices, 
strategies, and programs that provide 
teachers, principals, administrators, 
families, and other stakeholders with 
the data they need to inform and 
improve school and classroom 
instructional practices, decision- 
making, and overall effectiveness. 
Statement of the Proposed Absolute 
Priority. Under proposed absolute 
priority 2, the Department would 
provide funding to support strategies, 
practices, or programs that encourage 
and facilitate the evaluation, analysis, 
and use of student achievement or 
student growth data by educators, 
families, and other stakeholders in order 
to inform decision-making; improve 
student achievement or student growth, 
and teacher, school leader, school, or 
LEA performance and productivity; or 
enable data aggregation, analysis, and 
research. Where applicable, these data 
would be disaggregated using the 
student subgroups described in section 
1111(b)(3)(C)(xiii) of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act of 1965, as 
amended (ESEA) (economically 
disadvantaged students, students from 
major racial and ethnic groups, migrant 
students, students with limited English 
proficiency, students with disabilities, 
student gender). 
Proposed Absolute Priority 3— 
Innovations That Complement the 
Implementation of High Standards and 
High-Quality Assessments 
Background. A third key ARRA 
reform area is improving State academic 
content standards and student academic 
achievement standards so that they 
build toward college and career 
readiness, and implementing high- 
quality assessments aligned with those 
standards. In order to make the 
transition to such standards and 
assessments, States will need support 
in: Developing, acquiring, 
disseminating, and implementing high- 
quality curricular instructional 
materials and assessments; developing 
or acquiring and delivering high-quality 
professional development to support the 
transition to new standards, 
assessments, and instructional 
materials; and engaging in other 
strategies that align the standards and 
information from assessments with 
classroom practices that meet the needs 
of all students, including high-need 
students. 
Statement of the Proposed Absolute 
Priority. Under proposed absolute 
priority 3, the Department would 
provide funding for practices, strategies, 
or programs that support States’ efforts 
to transition to college- and career- 
readiness standards and assessments, 
including curricular and instructional 
practices, strategies, or programs in core 
academic subjects that are aligned with 
high academic content and achievement 
standards and with high-quality 
assessments based on those standards. 
Proposals may include practices, 
strategies, or programs that: (a) Increase 
the success of under-represented 
student populations in academically 
rigorous courses and programs (such as 
Advanced Placement or International 
Baccalaureate courses; dual enrollment 
programs; early college high schools; 
and science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics courses, especially 
those that incorporate rigorous and 
relevant project-, inquiry-, or design- 
based contextual learning 
opportunities); (b) increase the 
development and use of formative 
assessments or interim assessments, or 
other performance-based tools and 
metrics that are aligned with student 
content and academic achievement 
standards; or (c) translate the standards 
and information from assessments into 
classroom practices that meet the needs 
of all students, including high-need 
students. 
Proposed Absolute Priority 4— 
Innovations That Turn Around 
Persistently Low-Performing Schools 
Background. Although there are noted 
examples of successful school reform 
efforts, persistently low-performing 
schools (as defined in this notice) 
continue to plague this country’s system 
of public education and fail to 
adequately educate our Nation’s youth 
to succeed in a global economy. It is 
imperative that we as a Nation serve our 
most educationally needy schools in 
order to ensure that all students are 
prepared for the challenges of the global 
economy. 
Statement of the Proposed Absolute 
Priority. Under proposed absolute 
priority 4, the Department would 
provide funding to support strategies, 
practices, or programs that turn around 
persistently low-performing schools 
through either whole-school reform or 
targeted approaches to reform. 
Applicants addressing this priority must 
focus on either: 
(a) Whole-school reform, such as 
comprehensive interventions to assist, 
augment, or replace persistently low- 
performing schools; or 
(b) Targeted approaches to reform, 
including, but not limited to: (1) 
Providing more time for students to 
learn core academic content by 
expanding the school day, school week, 
or the school year, or by increasing 
instructional time for core academic 
subjects during the day and in the 
summer; (2) integrating student 
supports to address non-academic 
barriers to student achievement; or (3) 
creating multiple pathways for students 
to earn regular high school diplomas 
(e.g., transfer schools, awarding credit 
based on demonstrated evidence of 
student competency, offering dual- 
enrollment options). 
Proposed Competitive Preference 
Priorities 
As stated previously, we are 
proposing four competitive preference 
priorities that we may choose to apply 
to one or more of the three types of

Proposed Competitive Preference 
Priority 5—Innovations for Improving 
Early Learning Outcomes 
Background. Research demonstrates 
the importance of efforts to build early 
language and literacy skills, as well as 
skills with numbers and spatial 
thinking, as a means of eliminating the 
differences in student achievement or 
student growth that develop between 
children from low-income families and 
children from middle-income families 
during their school years.5 Investing in 
early learning programs to prevent the 
development of these gaps in skills can 
reduce the need for more costly and 
difficult interventions, including 
referrals to special education, later on in 
a child’s life.6 In addition, research 
indicates that investments in young 
children can yield dramatic economic 
benefits over the course of those 
children’s lives in the form of reduced 
incidence of crime and increased 
employment. This proposed competitive 
preference priority aligns with the 
Department’s efforts to increase the 
quality of existing early learning 
programs and expand access to high- 
quality early learning programs, 
particularly for children from low- 
income families. 
Statement of Proposed Competitive 
Preference Priority 5. We propose to 
give competitive preference to proposals 
that include practices, strategies, or 
programs to improve educational 
outcomes for high-need students who 
are young children (birth through 3rd 
grade) by enhancing the quality of early 
learning programs. Proposals must focus 
on (a) improving young children’s 
school readiness (including social, 
emotional, and cognitive) so that 
children are prepared for success in core 
academic subjects; (b) improving and 
aligning developmental milestones and 
standards with appropriate outcome 
measures; and (c) improving alignment, 
collaboration, and transitions between 
early learning programs that serve 
children from birth to age three, in 
preschools, and in kindergarten through 
third grade. 
Proposed Competitive Preference 
Priority 6—Innovations That Support 
College Access and Success 
Background. One way to help meet 
the President’s goal of restoring the 
United States to first in the world in the 
percentage of citizens holding college 
degrees is to increase the number of 
high school students with access to 
college who are prepared to succeed in 
an institution of higher education. 
Proposed competitive preference 
priority 6 would fund practices, 
strategies, and programs that prepare K– 
12 students for success in college. 
Statement of Proposed Competitive 
Preference Priority 6. We propose to 
give competitive preference to proposals 
for practices, strategies, or programs that 
enable K–12 students, particularly high 
school students, to successfully prepare 
for, enter, and graduate from a two- or 
four-year college. Proposals must 
include practices, strategies, or 
programs for K–12 students that address 
students’ preparedness and expectations 
related to college; help students 
understand issues of college 
affordability and the financial aid and 
college application processes; and 
provide support to students from peers 
and knowledgeable adults. 
Proposed Competitive Preference 
Priority 7—Innovations To Address the 
Unique Learning Needs of Students 
With Disabilities and Limited English 
Proficient Students 
Background. One of the primary goals 
of the ESEA, as well as the Individuals 
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 
is to improve the quality of education 
for all students, including students with 
disabilities and students who are 
limited English proficient. In particular, 
the ESEA requires each State and LEA 
to work toward narrowing achievement 
gaps and demonstrate high levels of 
progress for these two groups of 
students. However, as evidenced by 
results on State assessments under 
section 1111(b)(3) of the ESEA, schools 
often lack appropriate and effective 
strategies to enable a greater share of 
students with disabilities and limited 
English proficient students to meet high 
standards. 
Statement of Proposed Competitive 
Preference Priority 7. We propose to 
give competitive preference to proposals 
that include innovative strategies, 
practices, or programs to address the 
unique learning needs of students with 
disabilities, or the linguistic and 
academic needs of limited English 
proficient students. Proposals must 
focus on particular practices, strategies, 
or programs that are designed to 
improve academic outcomes and 
increase graduation rates for students 
with disabilities or limited English 
proficient students. 
Proposed Competitive Preference 
Priority 8—Innovations That Serve 
Schools in Rural LEAs 
Background. Solutions to educational 
challenges in rural areas frequently 
differ from what works in urban and 
suburban communities.7 This proposed 
competitive preference priority 
recognizes the need to bring education 
innovation and reform to all regions of 
the country, including rural LEAs. 
Statement of Proposed Competitive 
Preference Priority 8. We propose to 
give competitive preference to proposals 
that focus on the unique challenges of 
high-need students in schools within a 
rural LEA (as defined in this notice) and 
address the particular challenges faced 
by students in these schools. Proposals 
must include practices, strategies, or 
programs that improve student 
achievement or student growth, close 
achievement gaps, decrease dropout 
rates, increase high school graduation 
rates, or improve teacher and school 
leader effectiveness in one or more rural 
LEAs. 
Proposed Requirements 
Background 
The Investing in Innovation Fund 
would provide support to LEAs, and 
nonprofit organizations that partner 
with one or more LEAs or a consortium 
of schools that apply and successfully 
compete for a Scale-up, Validation, or 
Development grant. What follows are 
the statutory and proposed eligibility 
requirements for LEAs and nonprofit 
organizations. 
Proposed Requirements 
The Secretary proposes the following 
requirements for the Investing in 
Innovation Fund. We may apply these 
requirements in any year in which this 
program is in effect. 
Providing Innovations that Improve 
Achievement for High-Need Students: 
All applicants must implement 
practices, strategies, or programs for 
high-need students (as defined in this 
notice). 
Eligible applicants: Entities eligible to 
apply for Investing in Innovation Fund 
grants include: (a) an LEA or (b) a 
partnership between a nonprofit 
organization and (1) one or more LEAs 
or (2) a consortium of schools. 
Eligibility requirements: 8 To be 
eligible for an award, an eligible

technical changes to provisions of the authorizing 
legislation for this program. (See http://
thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&dbname=
cp111&sid=cp111LTV8y&refer=&r_n=hr220.111&
item=&sel=TOC_1120308&; and http://

=cp111&sid=cp111M6VRe&refer=&r_n=sr066.111&
item=&sel=TOC_904504&). These changes would 
modify the eligibility requirements currently set 
forth in section 14007(b)(2) and (c) by: (1) Making 
minor alterations to the sections concerning the 
basis for awards and the special eligibility rule, and 
(2) removing the reference to State measurable 
annual achievement objectives. In addition to these 
minor changes to the eligibility requirements, 
enactment of the proposed legislation would 
authorize eligible entities that include a partnership 
with a nonprofit organization, to make subgrants 
within the partnership. 
9 In this notice, we use many of the same 
definitions that were in the Race to the Top notice 
of proposed priorities, requirements, definitions, 
and selection criteria (see http://www.ed.gov/ 
legislation/FedRegister/proprule/2009-3/ 
072909d.html). The comment period for the Race to 
the Top program is now closed, and we are 
considering the comments on the definitions, as 
well as other sections of that notice. In the final 
notice for the Investing in Innovation Fund, we will 
align our definitions, as appropriate, with those 
included in the final notice for the Race to the Top 
program. 
applicant must meet several statutory 
requirements and one additional 
requirement. The requirements in 
paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) that 
follow are statutory; we are including 
them here for clarity. We are requesting 
comment on the proposed requirement 
in paragraph (5). 
To be eligible for an award, an 
applicant must: 
(1) Have significantly closed the 
achievement gaps between groups of 
students described in section 1111(b)(2) 
of the ESEA (economically 
disadvantaged students, students from 
major racial and ethnic groups, students 
with limited English proficiency, 
students with disabilities); 
(2) Have exceeded the State’s annual 
measurable objectives consistent with 
section 1111(b)(2) of the ESEA for two 
or more consecutive years or have 
demonstrated success in significantly 
increasing student achievement for all 
groups of students described in that 
section through another measure, such 
as measures described in section 
1111(c)(2) of the ESEA (i.e., the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress); 
(3) Have made significant 
improvements in other areas, such as 
graduation rates or increased 
recruitment and placement of high- 
quality teachers and school leaders, as 
demonstrated with other meaningful 
data; 
(4) Demonstrate that they have 
established partnerships with the 
private sector, which may include 
philanthropic organizations, and that 
the private sector will provide matching 
funds in order to help bring results to 
scale; and 
(5) In the case of a nonprofit 
organization, provide in its application 
the names of the LEAs with which it 
will partner, or the names of the schools 
in the consortium with which it will 
partner. If a nonprofit organization 
applicant intends to partner with 
additional LEAs or schools that are not 
named in its application, it must 
describe in its application the 
demographics and other characteristics 
of these LEAs and schools and the 
process it will use to select them as 
partners. An applicant must identify its 
specific partners before a grant award 
will be made. 
Note about LEA Eligibility: To be eligible 
for an award, an LEA applicant must be 
located within one of the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico. 
Note about Eligibility for an Entity that 
Includes a Nonprofit Organization: To be 
eligible for an award, the statute requires that 
an application submitted by a nonprofit 
organization, in partnership with one or more 
LEAs or a consortium of schools, be 
considered to have met the eligibility 
requirements in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) 
described earlier in this notice, if the 
nonprofit organization has a record of 
meeting those requirements. We are 
proposing that a nonprofit organization 
applicant be considered to have met these 
eligibility requirements through its record of 
work with an LEA. Therefore, an applicant 
that is a nonprofit organization would not 
necessarily need to select as a partner for its 
Investing in Innovation Fund grant an LEA 
or a consortium of schools that meets the 
eligibility requirements in paragraphs (1), (2), 
and (3) described earlier. Rather, the 
nonprofit organization would have to 
demonstrate that it has a record of meeting 
those requirements through the assistance it 
has provided to one or more LEAs in the 
past. 
Funding Categories: An applicant 
must state in its application whether it 
is applying for a Scale-up, Validation, or 
Development grant. An applicant may 
not submit an application for the same 
proposed project under more than one 
type of grant. An applicant will be 
considered for an award only for the 
type of grant for which it applies. 
Cost Sharing or Matching: To be 
eligible for an award, an applicant must 
demonstrate that it has established one 
or more partnerships with an entity or 
organization in the private sector, which 
may include philanthropic 
organizations, and that the entity or 
organization in the private sector will 
provide matching funds in order to help 
bring project results to scale. An 
applicant must obtain matching funds 
or in-kind donations equal to at least 20 
percent of its grant award. The Secretary 
may consider decreasing the 20 percent 
matching requirement in the most 
exceptional circumstances, on a case-by- 
case basis. An applicant that anticipates 
being unable to meet the 20 percent 
matching requirement must include in 
its application a request to the Secretary 
to reduce the matching level 
requirement, along with a statement of 
the basis for the request. 
Evaluation: An applicant receiving 
funds under this program must comply 
with the requirements of any evaluation 
of the program conducted by the 
Department. In addition, an applicant is 
required to conduct an independent 
evaluation (as defined in this notice) of 
its proposed project and must agree, 
along with its independent evaluator, to 
cooperate with any technical assistance 
provided by the Department or its 
contractor. The purpose of this technical 
assistance would be to ensure that the 
evaluations are of the highest quality 
and to encourage commonality in 
evaluation approaches across funded 
projects where it is feasible and useful 
to do so. Finally, an applicant receiving 
funds under this program must make 
broadly available through formal (e.g., 
peer-reviewed journals) or informal 
(e.g., newsletters) mechanisms, and in 
print or electronically, the results of any 
evaluations it conducts of its funded 
activities 
Participation in ‘‘Communities of 
Practice’’: Grantees will be required to 
participate in, organize, or facilitate, as 
appropriate, communities of practice for 
the Investing in Innovation Fund. A 
community of practice is a group of 
grantees that agrees to interact regularly 
to solve a persistent problem or improve 
practice in an area that is important to 
them. Establishment of communities of 
practice under the Investing in 
Innovation Fund will enable grantees to 
meet, discuss, and collaborate with each 
other regarding grantee projects. 
Proposed Definitions 
Background 
Several important terms associated 
with the Investing in Innovation Fund 
are not defined in the ARRA. 
Proposed Definitions 
The Secretary proposes the following 
definitions for the Investing in 
Innovation Fund.9 We may apply one or 
more of these definitions in any year in 
which this program is in effect. 
1. Definitions Related to Evidence 
Strong evidence means evidence from 
previous studies whose designs can 
support causal conclusions (i.e., studies

with high internal validity), and studies 
that in total include enough of the range 
of participants and settings to support 
scaling up to the State, regional, or 
national level (i.e., studies with high 
external validity). The following are 
examples of strong evidence: (1) More 
than one well-designed and well- 
implemented experimental study (as 
defined in this notice) or well-designed 
and well-implemented quasi- 
experimental study (as defined in this 
notice) that supports the effectiveness of 
the practice, strategy, or program; or (2) 
one large, well-designed and well- 
implemented randomized controlled, 
multisite trial that supports the 
effectiveness of the practice, strategy, or 
program. 
Moderate evidence means evidence 
from previous studies whose designs 
can support causal conclusions (i.e., 
studies with high internal validity) but 
have limited generalizability (i.e., 
moderate external validity), or studies 
with high external validity but moderate 
internal validity. The following would 
constitute moderate evidence: (1) At 
least one well-designed and well- 
implemented experimental or quasi- 
experimental study supporting the 
effectiveness of the practice strategy, or 
program, with small sample sizes or 
other conditions of implementation or 
analysis that limit generalizability; (2) at 
least one well-designed and well- 
implemented experimental or quasi- 
experimental study that does not 
demonstrate equivalence between the 
intervention and comparison groups at 
program entry but that has no other 
major flaws related to internal validity; 
or (3) correlational research with strong 
statistical controls for selection bias and 
for discerning the influence of internal 
factors. 
Experimental study means a study 
that employs random assignment of 
students, teachers, classrooms, or 
schools to participate in a project being 
evaluated (treatment group) or not to 
participate in the project (control 
group). The effect of the project is the 
difference in outcomes between the 
treatment and control groups. 
Quasi-experimental study means an 
evaluation design that attempts to 
approximate an experimental design 
and can support causal conclusions (i.e., 
minimizes threats to internal validity, 
such as selection bias, or allows them to 
be modeled). Well-designed quasi- 
experimental studies include carefully 
matched comparison group designs (as 
defined in this notice), interrupted time 
series designs (as defined in this notice), 
or regression discontinuity designs (as 
defined in this notice). 
Carefully matched comparison group 
design means a type of quasi- 
experimental study that attempts to 
approximate an experimental study. 
More specifically, it is a design in which 
project participants are matched with 
non-participants based on key 
characteristics that are thought to be 
related to the outcome. These 
characteristics include, but are not 
limited to: (1) Prior test scores and other 
measures of academic achievement 
(preferably, the same measures that the 
study will use to evaluate outcomes for 
the two groups); (2) demographic 
characteristics, such as age, disability, 
gender, English proficiency, ethnicity, 
poverty level, parents’ educational 
attainment, and single- or two-parent 
family background; (3) the time period 
in which the two groups are studied 
(e.g., the two groups are children 
entering kindergarten in the same year 
as opposed to sequential years); and (4) 
methods used to collect outcome data 
(e.g., the same test of reading skills 
administered in the same way to both 
groups). 
Interrupted time series design means 
a type of quasi-experimental study in 
which the outcome of interest is 
measured multiple times before and 
after the treatment for program 
participants only. If the program had an 
impact, the outcomes after treatment 
will have a different slope or level from 
those before treatment. That is, the 
series should show an ‘‘interruption’’ of 
the prior situation at the time when the 
program was implemented. Adding a 
nonequivalent control group time series, 
such as schools not participating in the 
program or schools participating in the 
program in a different geographic area, 
increases the reliability of the findings. 
Regression discontinuity design study 
means, in part, a quasi-experimental 
study design that closely approximates 
an experimental study. In a regression 
discontinuity design, participants are 
assigned to a treatment or control group 
based on a numerical rating or score of 
a variable unrelated to the treatment 
such as the rating of an application for 
funding. Another example would be 
assignment of eligible students, 
teachers, classrooms, or schools above a 
certain score (‘‘cut score’’) to the 
treatment group and assignment of those 
below the score to the control group. 
Independent evaluation means that 
the evaluation is designed and carried 
out independent of, but in coordination 
with, any employees of the entities who 
develop a practice, strategy, or program 
and are implementing it. This 
independence helps ensure the 
objectivity of an evaluation and 
prevents even the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. 
2. Other Definitions 
Consortium of schools means two or 
more public elementary or secondary 
schools acting collaboratively for the 
purpose of applying for and 
implementing an Investing in 
Innovation Fund grant jointly with an 
eligible nonprofit organization. 
Nonprofit organization means an 
entity that meets the definition of 
‘‘nonprofit’’ under 34 CFR 77.1(c), or an 
institution of higher education as 
defined by section 101(a) of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965, as amended. 
Formative assessment means an 
assessment that is embedded in 
instruction and is used by teachers to 
provide timely feedback on student 
understanding and to adjust ongoing 
teaching and learning effectively. 
Interim assessment means an 
assessment given at regular and 
specified intervals throughout the 
school year, and is designed to evaluate 
students’ knowledge and skills relative 
to a specific set of academic standards, 
the results of which can be aggregated 
(e.g., by course, grade level, school, or 
LEA) in order to inform teachers and 
administrators at the student, classroom, 
school, and LEA levels. 
Highly effective school leader means a 
principal or other school leader whose 
students, overall and for each subgroup 
as described in section 
1111(b)(3)(C)(xiii) of the ESEA (i.e., 
economically disadvantaged students, 
students from major racial and ethnic 
groups, migrant students, students with 
disabilities, students with limited 
English proficiency, student gender), 
demonstrate high rates (e.g., more than 
one grade level in an academic year) of 
student growth. Applicants may 
supplement this definition as they see 
fit so long as school leader effectiveness 
is judged, in significant measure, by 
student growth. 
Highly effective teacher means a 
teacher whose students achieve high 
rates (e.g., more than one grade level in 
an academic year) of student growth. 
Applicants may supplement this 
definition as they see fit so long as 
teacher effectiveness is judged, in 
significant measure, by student growth. 
High-need student means a student at 
risk of educational failure, or otherwise 
in need of special assistance and 
support, such as students who are living 
in poverty, who are far below grade 
level, who are over-age and under- 
credited, who have left school before 
receiving a regular high school diploma, 
who are at risk of not graduating with 
a regular high school diploma on time,

I schools and are eligible for, but do not 
receive, Title I funds. 
National level, as used in reference to 
a Scale-up grant, describes a project that 
is able to be effective in a wide variety 
of communities and student populations 
around the country, including rural and 
urban areas, as well as with different

students, students with disabilities, 
students with limited English 
proficiency, student gender). 
Rural LEA means an LEA that is 
eligible under the Small Rural School 
Achievement (SRSA) program or the 
Rural and Low-Income School (RLIS) 
program authorized under Title VI, Part 
B of the ESEA. Applicants may 
determine whether a particular LEA is 
eligible for these programs by referring 
to information on the following 
Department Web sites. For the SRSA:

Student growth means the change in 
student achievement data for an 
individual student between two or more 
points in time. Growth may be 
measured by a variety of approaches, 
but any approach used must be 
statistically rigorous and based on 
student achievement data, and may also 
include other measures of student 
learning in order to increase the 
construct validity and generalizability of

Proposed Selection Criteria 
Background 
The proposed selection criteria are 
intended to ensure that applicants— 
regardless of grant type—can 
demonstrate that they have the 
experience and capacity to expand or 
develop practices, strategies, or 
programs that will have a positive 
impact on improving student 
achievement or student growth, closing 
achievement gaps, decreasing dropout 
rates, or increasing high school 
graduation rates. 
Proposed Selection Criteria 
The Secretary proposes the following 
selection criteria for evaluating an 
application under the Investing in 
Innovation Fund. We may apply one or 
more of these criteria in any year in 
which this program is in effect. In the 
notice inviting applications or the 
application package, or both, we will 
announce the maximum possible points 
assigned to each criterion. 
1. Scale-Up Grants 
A. Need for the Project and Quality of 
the Project Design

project and quality of the design of the 
proposed project, the Secretary 
considers the following factors: 
(a) The extent to which the proposed 
project represents an exceptional 
approach to the priorities the applicant 
is seeking to meet (i.e., addresses a 
largely unmet need, particularly for 
high-need students, and is a practice, 
strategy, or program that has not already 
been widely adopted). 
(b) The extent to which the proposed 
project has a clear set of goals and an 
explicit strategy (i.e., logic model), with 
actions that are (i) aligned with the 
priorities the applicant is seeking to 
meet, and (ii) expected to result in 
achieving the goals, objectives, and 
outcomes of the proposed project. 
B. Strength of Research, Significance of 
Effect, and Magnitude of Effect 
(1) The Secretary considers the 
strength of the existing research 
evidence and the significance of effect 
in support of the proposed project, as 
well as the magnitude of the effect on 
improving student achievement or 
student growth, closing achievement 
gaps, decreasing dropout rates, or 
increasing high school graduation rates. 
Applicants may also demonstrate 
success through an intermediate 
variable that is directly correlated with 
improving these outcomes, such as 
teacher or school leader effectiveness, or 
improvements in school climate. 
(2) In determining the strength of the 
existing research evidence and the 
significance of effect to support the 
proposed project, as well as the 
magnitude of the effect, the Secretary 
considers the following factors: 
(a) The extent to which the applicant 
demonstrates that there is strong 
evidence that the proposed practice, 
strategy, or program will have a 
statistically significant effect on 
improving student achievement or 
student growth, closing achievement 
gaps, decreasing dropout rates, or 
increasing high school graduation rates, 
and that the effect will be substantial 
and important. 
(b) The importance and magnitude of 
the effect expected to be obtained by the 
proposed project, including the extent 
to which the project will substantially 
and measurably improve student 
achievement or student growth, close 
achievement gaps, decrease dropout 
rates, or increase high school graduation 
rates. The evidence in support of the 
importance and magnitude of the effect 
would be the research-based evidence 
provided by the applicant to support the 
proposed project. 
C. Experience of the Applicant 
(1) The Secretary considers the 
experience of the applicant in 
implementing the proposed project. 
(2) In determining the experience of 
the applicant, the Secretary considers

to which the methods of evaluation will 
include a well-designed quasi- 
experimental study. 
(b) The extent to which, for either an 
experimental study or quasi- 
experimental study, the study will be 
conducted of the practice, strategy, or 
program as implemented at scale. 
(c) The extent to which the methods 
of evaluation will provide high-quality 
implementation data and performance 
feedback, and permit periodic 
assessment of progress toward achieving 
intended outcomes. 
(d) The extent to which the evaluation 
will provide sufficient information 
about the key elements and approach of 
the project to facilitate replication or 
testing in other settings. 
(e) The extent to which the proposed 
project plan includes sufficient 
resources to effectively carry out the 
project evaluation.

3. Development Grants 
We anticipate using a two-tier process 
to review the applications for 
Development grants. This two-tier 
review would include a pre-application 
process to select applicants that would 
be invited to submit a full application. 
We anticipate that the pre-application 
process will require an applicant to 
submit a short summary of its proposed 
project and that we will use some or all 
of the selection criteria that follow to 
rate the proposed projects, but with a 
particular focus on the need for the 
project and quality of the project design 
and the strength of research, 
significance of effect, and magnitude of 
effect in support of the proposed 
project. Applicants that are rated highly 
in the pre-application phase would be 
invited to submit a full application, 
from which the awards for Development 
grants would be made.

strength of the existing research 
evidence to support the proposed 
project and the significance of effect in 
support of the proposed project, as well 
as the magnitude of the effect on 
improving student achievement or 
student growth, closing achievement 
gaps, decreasing dropout rates, or 
increasing high school graduation rates. 
Applicants may also demonstrate 
success through an intermediate 
variable that is directly correlated with 
improving these outcomes, such as 
teacher or school leader effectiveness, or 
improvements in school climate. 
(2) In determining the strength of the 
existing research evidence, the 
significance of effect to support the 
proposed project, and the magnitude of 
effect, the Secretary considers the 
following factors: 
(a) The extent to which the applicant 
demonstrates that there are research- 
based findings or reasonable hypotheses 
that support the proposed project, 
including related research in education 
and other sectors. 
(b) The extent to which the proposed 
project has been attempted previously, 
albeit on a limited scale or in a limited 
setting, with promising results that 
suggest that more formal and systematic 
study is warranted. 
(c) The extent to which the applicant 
demonstrates that, if funded, the 
proposed project likely will have a 
positive impact, as measured by the 
importance or magnitude of the effect, 
on improving student achievement or 
student growth, closing achievement 
gaps, decreasing dropout rates, or 
increasing high school graduation rates. 
C. Experience of the Applicant 
(1) The Secretary considers the 
experience of the applicant in 
implementing the proposed project or a 
similar project. 
(2) In determining the experience of 
the applicant, the Secretary considers 
the following factors: 
(a) The past performance of the 
applicant in implementing projects of 
the size and scope proposed by the 
applicant. 
(b) The extent to which an applicant 
provides information and data 
demonstrating that it has (or supported 
an LEA in taking actions that)— 
(i) Significantly closed the 
achievement gaps between groups of 
students described in section 1111(b)(2) 
of the ESEA; 
(ii) Exceeded the State’s annual 
measurable objectives consistent with 
section 1111(b)(2) of the ESEA for two 
or more consecutive years or has 
demonstrated success in significantly 
increasing student achievement for all 
groups of students described in that 
section through another measure, such 
as measures described in section 
1111(c)(2) of the ESEA (i.e., the National 
Assessment of Educational Progress); 
and 
(iii) Made significant improvements 
in other areas, such as graduation rates 
or increased recruitment and placement 
of high-quality teachers and school 
leaders, as demonstrated with other 
meaningful data. 
D. Quality of the Project Evaluation 
1. The Secretary considers the quality 
of the evaluation to be conducted of the 
proposed project. 
2. In determining the quality of the 
evaluation, the Secretary considers the 
following factors. 
(a) The extent to which the methods 
of evaluation are appropriate to the size 
and scope of the proposed project. 
(b) The extent to which the methods 
of evaluation will provide high-quality 
implementation data and performance 
feedback, and permit periodic 
assessment of progress toward achieving 
intended outcomes. 
(c) The extent to which the evaluation 
will provide sufficient information 
about the key elements and approach of 
the project to facilitate further 
development, replication, or testing in 
other settings. 
(d) The extent to which the proposed 
project plan includes sufficient 
resources to effectively carry out the 
project evaluation. 
Note: We encourage applicants to review 
the following technical assistance resources 
on evaluation: (1) What Works Clearinghouse 
Procedures and Standards Handbook: http:// 
ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/references/idocviewer/ 
doc.aspx?docid=19&tocid=1; and (2) IES/ 
NCEE Technical Methods papers: http:// 
ies.ed.gov/ncee/tech_methods/. 
E. Strategy and Capacity to Further 
Develop and Scale 
1. The Secretary considers the quality 
of the applicant’s strategy and capacity 
to further develop and scale the 
proposed project. 
2. In determining the quality of the 
strategy and capacity to further develop 
and scale the proposed project, the 
Secretary considers: 
(a) The number of students proposed 
to be reached by the proposed project 
and the applicant’s capacity to reach the 
proposed number of students during the 
course of the grant period. 
(b) The applicant’s capacity (e.g., in 
terms of qualified personnel, financial 
resources, management capacity) to 
further develop and scale the proposed 
practice, strategy, or program, or to work 
with others to ensure that the proposed 
practice, strategy, or program can be 
further developed and scaled, based on 
the findings of the proposed project. 
(c) The feasibility of the proposed 
project to be replicated successfully, if

positive results are obtained, in a variety 
of settings and with a variety of student 
populations. Evidence of this ability 
includes the availability of resources 
and expertise required for implementing 
the project with fidelity, and the 
proposed project’s evidence of relative 
ease of use or user satisfaction. 
(d) The applicant’s estimate of the 
cost of the proposed project, which 
includes the start-up and operating costs 
per student (including indirect costs) for 
reaching the total number of students 
proposed to be served by the project as 
well as for the applicant or others to 
reach 100,000, 250,000, and 500,000 
students. 
(e) The mechanisms the applicant will 
use to broadly disseminate information 
on its project to support further 
development or replication. 
F. Sustainability 
1. The Secretary considers the 
adequacy of resources to continue to 
develop or expand the proposed 
practice, strategy, or program after the 
grant period ends. 
2. In determining the adequacy of 
resources for the proposed project, the 
Secretary considers the following 
factors: 
(a) The extent to which the applicant 
demonstrates that it has the resources, 
as well as the support from stakeholders 
(e.g., State educational agencies, 
teachers’ unions) to operate the project 
beyond the length of the Development 
grant. 
(b) The potential and planning for the 
incorporation of project purposes, 
activities, or benefits into the ongoing 
work of the LEA, schools, or nonprofit 
organization at the end of the 
Development grant. 
G. Quality of the Management Plan and 
Personnel 
1. The Secretary considers the quality 
of the management plan and personnel 
for the proposed project. 
2. In determining the quality of the 
management plan and personnel for the 
proposed project, the Secretary 
considers: 
(a) The adequacy of the management 
plan to achieve the objectives of the 
proposed project on time and within 
budget, including clearly defined 
responsibilities, timelines, and 
milestones for accomplishing project 
tasks. 
(b) The qualifications, including 
relevant training and experience, of the 
project director and key project 
personnel, especially in managing 
projects of the size and scope of the 
proposed project. 
Final Priorities, Requirements, 
Definitions, and Selection Criteria: We 
will announce the final priorities, 
requirements, definitions, and selection 
criteria in a notice in the Federal 
Register. We will determine the final 
priorities, requirements, definitions, and 
selection criteria after considering 
responses to this notice and other 
information available to the Department. 
This notice does not preclude us from 
proposing additional priorities, 
requirements, definitions, or selection 
criteria, subject to meeting applicable 
rulemaking requirements. 
Note: This notice does not solicit 
applications. In any year in which we choose 
to use these priorities, requirements, and 
selection criteria, we invite applications 
through a notice in the Federal Register. 
Executive Order 12866: Under 
Executive Order 12866, the Secretary 
must determine whether this regulatory 
action is ‘‘significant’’ and, therefore, 
subject to the requirements of the 
Executive Order and subject to review 
by OMB. Section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866 defines a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ as an action likely to result in 
a rule that may (1) have an annual effect 
on the economy of $100 million or 
more, or adversely affect a sector of the 
economy, productivity, competition, 
jobs, the environment, public health or 
safety, or State, local, or tribal 
governments, or communities in a 
material way (also referred to as an 
‘‘economically significant’’ rule); 
(2) create serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impacts of 
entitlement grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in the Executive 
order. Pursuant to the Executive order, 
it has been determined that this 
regulatory action will have an annual 
effect on the economy of more than 
$100 million because the amount of 
government transfers provided through 
the Investing in Innovation Fund will 
exceed that amount. Therefore, this 
action is ‘‘economically significant’’ and 
subject to OMB review under section 
3(f)(1) of the Executive order. 
The potential costs associated with 
this proposed regulatory action are 
those resulting from statutory 
requirements and those we have 
determined as necessary for 
administering this program effectively 
and efficiently. 
In assessing the potential costs and 
benefits—both quantitative and 
qualitative—of this proposed regulatory 
action, we have determined that the 
benefits of the proposed priorities, 
requirements, definitions, and selection 
criteria justify the costs. 
We have determined, also, that this 
proposed regulatory action does not 
unduly interfere with State, local, and 
tribal governments in the exercise of 
their governmental functions. 
Need for Federal Regulatory Action 
These proposed priorities, 
requirements, definitions, and selection 
criteria are needed to implement the 
Investing in Innovation Fund. The 
Secretary does not believe that the 
statute, by itself, provides a sufficient 
level of detail to ensure that the program 
achieves the greatest national impact in 
promoting educational innovation. The 
authorizing language is very brief and 
provides only broad parameters 
governing the program. The proposals 
discussed in this notice would provide 
greater clarity on the types of activities 
the Department seeks to fund, and 
permit the Department to use selection 
criteria that are closely aligned with the 
Secretary’s priorities. 
In the absence of specific selection 
criteria for the Investing in Innovation 
Fund, the Department would use the 
general selection criteria in 34 CFR 
75.210 of the Education Department 
General Administrative Regulations in 
selecting grant recipients. The Secretary 
does not believe the use of those general 
criteria would be appropriate for the 
Investing in Innovation Fund grant 
competition, because they do not focus 
on the educational reform and 
innovation activities most likely to raise 
student achievement and eliminate 
persistent disparities in achievement 
across different populations of students. 
Regulatory Alternatives Considered 
The Department considered a variety 
of possible priorities, requirements, 
definitions, and selection criteria before 
deciding to propose those included in 
this notice. The proposed priorities, 
requirements, definitions, and selection 
criteria are those that the Secretary 
believes best capture the purposes of the 
program while clarifying what the 
Secretary expects the program to 
accomplish and ensuring that program 
activities are aligned with Departmental 
priorities. The proposals would also 
provide eligible applicants with 
flexibility in selecting activities to apply 
to carry out under the program. The 
Secretary believes that the proposals, 
thus, appropriately balance a limited 
degree of specificity with broad 
flexibility in implementation. We seek

public comment on whether we have 
achieved the optimal balance. 
Summary of Costs and Benefits 
The Secretary believes that the 
proposed priorities, requirements, 
definitions, and selection criteria would 
not impose significant costs on eligible 
LEAs, nonprofit organizations, or other 
entities that would receive assistance 
through the Investing in Innovation 
Fund. The Secretary also believes that 
the benefits of implementing the 
proposals contained in this notice 
outweigh any associated costs. 
The Secretary believes that the 
proposed priorities, requirements, 
definitions, and selection criteria would 
result in selection of high-quality 
applications to implement activities that 
are most likely to have a significant 
national impact on educational reform 
and improvement. Through the 
proposals discussed in this notice, the 
Secretary seeks to provide clarity as to 
the scope of activities he expects to 
support with program funds and the 
expected burden of work involved in 
preparing an application and 
implementing a project under the 
program. The pool of possible 
applicants is very large; during school 
year 2007–08, 9,729 LEAs across the 
country (about 65 percent of all LEAs) 
made adequate yearly progress. 
Although not every one of those LEAs 
would necessarily meet all the 
eligibility requirements, the number of 
LEAs that would meet them is likely to 
be in the thousands. Potential 
applicants, both LEAs and nonprofit 
organizations, would need to consider 
carefully the effort that will be required 
to prepare a strong application, their 
capacity to implement a project 
successfully, and their chances of 
submitting a successful application. 
The Secretary believes that the costs 
imposed on applicants by the proposed 
priorities, requirements, definitions, and 
selection criteria would be limited to 
paperwork burden related to preparing 
an application and that the benefits of 
implementing these proposals would 
outweigh any costs incurred by 
applicants. The costs of carrying out 
activities would be paid for with 
program funds and with matching funds 
provided by private-sector partners. 
Thus, the costs of implementation 
would not be a burden for any eligible 
applicants, including small entities. 
However, under the proposed selection 
criteria the Secretary would assess the 
extent to which an applicant would be 
able to sustain a project once Federal 
funding through the Investing in 
Innovation Fund is no longer available. 
Thus, eligible applicants should 
propose activities that they will be able 
to sustain without funding from the 
program and, thus, in essence, should 
include in their project plan the specific 
steps they will take for sustained 
implementation of the proposed project. 
The proposed priorities would 
provide flexibility on the topics and 
types of grant activities applicants could 
propose. The proposal for the three 
types of grants—Scale-up, Validation, 
and Development grants—would allow 
potential applicants to determine which 
type of grant they are best suited to 
apply for, based on their own priorities, 
resources, and capacity to implement 
grant activities. 
Accounting Statement 
As required by OMB Circular A–4 
(available at http:// 
www.Whitehouse.gov/omb/Circulars/

have prepared an accounting statement 
showing the classification of the 
expenditures associated with the 
provisions of this proposed regulatory 
action. This table provides our best 
estimate of the Federal payments to be 
made to LEAs and nonprofit 
organizations under this program as a 
result of this proposed regulatory action. 
Expenditures are classified as transfers

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
The requirements and selection 
criteria proposed in this notice will 
require the collection of information 
that is subject to review by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520). It is our plan to 
offer a comment period for the 
information collection at the time of the 
notice of final priorities, requirements, 
definitions, and selection criteria. At 
that time, the Department will submit 
the information collection to OMB for 
its review and provide the specific 
burden hours associated with each of 
the requirements and selection criteria 
for comment. However, because it is 
likely that the information collection 
will be reviewed under emergency OMB 
processing, the Department encourages 
the public to comment on the estimates 
we are providing for the burden hours 
associated with the requirements and 
selection criteria proposed in this 
notice. 
Estimates for Scale-up Grants: We 
estimate 100 applicants for Scale-up 
grants, and that each applicant would 
spend approximately 120 hours of staff 
time to address the application 
requirements and criteria, prepare the 
application, and obtain necessary 
clearances. The total number of hours 
for all Scale-up applicants is an 
estimated 12,000 hours (100 applicants 
times 120 hours equals 12,000 hours). 
Estimates for Validation Grants: We 
estimate 500 applicants for Validation 
grants, and that each applicant would 
spend approximately 120 hours of staff 
time to address the application 
requirements and criteria, prepare the 
application, and obtain necessary 
clearances. The total number of hours 
for all Validation applicants is an 
estimated 60,000 hours (500 applicants 
times 120 hours equals 60,000 hours). 
Estimates for Development Grants: 
We estimate 2000 pre-applications and 
100 full applications for Development 
grants. We estimate that pre-applicants 
will spend approximately 60 hours of 
staff time to address the pre-application 
requirements and criteria, prepare the 
pre-application, and obtain all necessary 
clearances for the pre-application. We 
estimate that full applicants will spend 
approximately 60 hours of staff time to 
address the full application 
requirements and criteria, prepare the 
full application, and obtain all 
necessary clearances for the full 
application. The total number of hours 
for all Development pre-applicants and 
full applicants is an estimated 126,000 
hours ((2000 pre-applicants times 60 
hours equals 120,000 hours) plus (100 
full applicants times 60 hours equals 
6,000 hours)). 
Total Estimates: Across the three 
grant types, we estimate the average 
total cost per hour of the LEA and 
nonprofit organization staff who carry 
out this work to be $25.00 an hour. The 
total estimated cost for all applicants 
would be $4,950,000 ($25.00 times 
198,000 (12,000 + 60,000 + 126,000) 
hours equals $4,950,000). 
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 
The Secretary certifies that this 
proposed regulatory action will not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
The small entities that this proposed 
regulatory action will affect are small 
LEAs or nonprofit organizations 
applying for and receiving funds under 
this program. The Secretary believes 
that the costs imposed on applicants by

original request. 
the proposed priorities, requirements, 
definitions, and selection criteria would 
be limited to paperwork burden related 
to preparing an application and that the 
benefits of implementing these 
proposals would outweigh any costs 
incurred by applicants. 
Participation in this program is 
voluntary. For this reason, the proposed 
priorities, requirements, definitions, and 
selection criteria would impose no 
burden on small entities in general. 
Eligible applicants would determine 
whether to apply for funds, and have 
the opportunity to weigh the 
requirements for preparing applications, 
and any associated costs, against the 
likelihood of receiving funding and the 
requirements for implementing projects 
under the program. Eligible applicants 
most likely would apply only if they 
determine that the likely benefits exceed 
the costs of preparing an application. 
The likely benefits include the potential 
receipt of a grant as well as other 
benefits that may accrue to an entity 
through its development of an 
application, such as the use of that 
application to spur educational reforms 
and improvements without additional 
Federal funding. 
The U.S. Small Business 
Administration Size Standards defines 
as ‘‘small entities’’ for-profit or 
nonprofit institutions with total annual 
revenue below $7,000,000 or, if they are 
institutions controlled by small 
governmental jurisdictions (that are 
comprised of cities, counties, towns, 
townships, villages, school districts, or 
special districts), with a population of 
less than 50,000. The Urban Institute’s 
National Center for Charitable Statistics 
reported that of 203,635 nonprofit 
organizations that had an educational 
mission and reported revenue to the IRS 
by July 2009, 200,342 (or about 98 
percent) had revenues of less than $5 
million. In addition, there are 12,484 
LEAs in the country that meet the 
definition of small entity. However, the 
Secretary believes that only a small 
number of these entities would be 
interested in applying for funds under 
this program, thus reducing the 
likelihood that the proposals contained 
in this notice would have a significant 
economic impact on small entities. 
In addition, the Secretary believes 
that the proposed priorities, 
requirements, definitions, and selection 
criteria discussed in this notice do not 
impose any additional burden on small 
entities applying for a grant than they 
would face in the absence of the 
proposed action. That is, the length of 
the applications those entities would 
submit in the absence of the regulatory 
action and the time needed to prepare 
an application would likely be the same. 
Further, the proposed action may help 
small entities determine whether they 
have the interest, need, or capacity to 
implement activities under the program 
and, thus, prevent small entities that do 
not have such an interest, need, and 
capacity from absorbing the burden of 
applying. 
This proposed regulatory action 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on small entities once they 
receive a grant because they would be 
able to meet the costs of compliance 
using the funds provided under this 
program and with any matching funds 
provided by private-sector partners. 
The Secretary invites comments from 
small nonprofit organizations and small 
LEAs as to whether they believe this 
proposed regulatory action would have 
a significant economic impact on them 
and, if so, requests evidence to support 
that belief.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
Notice of Intent To Prepare an 
Environmental Impact Statement for a 
Proposed Federal Loan Guarantee To 
Support Construction and Start-up of 
the Taylorville Energy Center in 
Taylorville, IL 
AGENCY: Department of Energy, Loan 
Guarantee Program. 
ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an 
environmental impact statement and 
conduct a public scoping meeting. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of 
Energy (DOE) announces its intent to 
prepare an environmental impact 
statement (EIS) pursuant to the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as 
amended (NEPA), the Council on 
Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA 
regulations, and the DOE NEPA 
implementing procedures to assess the 
potential environmental impacts for its 
proposed action of issuing a Federal 
loan guarantee to Christian County 
Generation, L.L.C. (CCG) (DOE/EIS– 
0430). CCG submitted an application to 
DOE under the Federal loan guarantee 
program pursuant to the Energy Policy 
Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) to support 
construction and start-up of the 
Taylorville Energy Center in Taylorville, 
Illinois (‘‘the Facility’’).1 
CCG is a limited liability company 
that is currently owned by Tenaska 
Taylorville, LLC, an affiliate of Tenaska, 
Inc., an Omaha, Nebraska-based power 
development company, and by MDL 
Holding Company, L.L.C. of Louisville, 
Kentucky. CCG proposes to develop the 
Facility on an 886-acre parcel of land. 
As proposed, the approximately 730 
megawatt (gross) electric generation 
Facility would utilize integrated 
gasification combined-cycle technology 
to produce electricity from Illinois 
bituminous coal. Synthesis gas 
processing would also allow the 
separation and capture of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) and the manufacture of 
pipeline-quality Substitute Natural Gas 
(‘‘SNG’’ or ‘‘methane’’). SNG would be 
used in a power block with two 
combustion turbines and one steam 
turbine. The Facility would be designed
