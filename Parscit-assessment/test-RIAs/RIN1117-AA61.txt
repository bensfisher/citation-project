 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), DEA is required to maintain a closed system of 
controls on controlled substances.  For Schedule II controlled substances, which have the 
highest potential for abuse and dependence of those drugs with an accepted medical use in 
treatment in the United States, the CSA mandates that, with very limited exceptions, a 
pharmacist may only dispense a Schedule II controlled substance if there is an original 
written prescription from a practitioner.  For Schedule III through IV controlled substances, 
the pharmacist may dispense if there is a written (original or fax) or oral prescription from a 
practitioner.  DEA is proposing to give practitioners the option of signing and transmitting 
controlled substance prescriptions electronically; pharmacies would maintain records of these 
prescriptions electronically.  The proposed rules for electronic prescriptions for controlled 
substances are an addition to, not a replacement of, the existing rules for controlled substance 
prescriptions.  Practitioners will continue to be able to issue controlled substance 
prescriptions on paper or, for Schedule III-V substances, fax or call in prescriptions. 
 
DEA is proposing to allow, but not require, electronic prescriptions for controlled substances 
if the systems used to create, transmit, and process controlled substance prescriptions meet 
certain requirements that DEA has identified as being necessary to prevent the misuse of the 
systems for diversion and to ensure that the records will be usable in legal actions if needed.  
DEA examined four options.  Under the Base Case, service providers would conduct in-
person identity proofing and verify the DEA registration and State licenses of each 
practitioner allowed to sign an electronic controlled substance prescription.  Before signing 
such a prescription, the practitioner would authenticate to the system using two-factor 
authentication that meets the standards of NIST Special Publication 800-63 Level 4.  The 
systems would also have to meet requirements for the information contained in a controlled 
substance prescription.  The electronic controlled substance prescription would have to be 
digitally signed by the service provider or first intermediary and archived.  Practitioners 
would have to review a monthly log of controlled substance prescriptions issued under the 
practitioner’s name.  Pharmacies would also have to digitally sign the controlled substance 
prescription on receipt and archive that record.  Pharmacy systems would have to maintain an 
internal audit trail.  All service providers would have to obtain a third-party audit annually 
that meets the requirements of a SysTrust, WebTrust, or SAS 70 audit for physical security 
and processing integrity. 
 
Option 1 differs from the Base Case only in that a DEA-registered hospital, a state licensing 
board, or a law enforcement agency would conduct the initial in-person identity proofing.  
The service provider would verify the DEA registration and State license and contact the 
applicant to verify that the practitioner had submitted the application.  Option 2 is a modified 
public key infrastructure approach.  The practitioner would obtain a digital certificate from a 
recognized Certification Authority and use that to digitally sign the controlled substances 
prescriptions.  The monthly log check would be eliminated, and the audit would address only 
processing integrity.  Option 3 would impose no requirements on the service providers.  
April 2008 i   
 Pharmacies would be required to phone the practitioner to verify each controlled substance 
prescription received. 
 
COSTS 
 
DEA estimates that the costs of the options range from $19 million for Option 2 to $1.3 
billion for Option 3, both annualized over 15 years at 7 percent discount rate.  The Base Case 
is estimated to cost $33 million annualized and Option 1 $38 million.  Table ES-1 presents 
the estimated annualized costs of all options. 
Table ES-1: Total Costs ($) 
 7.0 percent 3.0 percent 
Base Case $32,561,000 $33,392,000 
Option 1 $38,256,000 $39,221,000 
Option 2 $18,595,000 $18,928,000 
Option 3 $1,280,000,000 $1,404,000,000 
 
 
Most of the direct practitioner cost in the Base Case and Option 1 is driven by the 
requirement to check a computer-generated log of controlled substance prescriptions once a 
month.  The service provider costs over time are primarily the costs of the annual audit, 
which accounts for all but about $1.2 million a year of the annualized service provider costs 
in the first three options. 
 
BENEFITS 
 
The benefits of the rule that can be quantified – reductions in callbacks ($316 million) and 
reduced public wait time (up to $589 million) (at 7 percent) – far exceed the cost of the three 
of the four options considered.  DEA has not attempted to quantify any reduction in medical 
errors.  DEA expects that there will be reduced medication errors linked to more readable 
prescriptions, but decided that it did not have a reasonable basis for quantifying the benefits.  
Another benefit of electronic prescriptions for controlled substances that is ascribable to the 
proposed rule, but not easily quantified and monetized, would come from reductions in 
controlled substance prescription forgery and alteration. 
 
SMALL ENTITY IMPACTS 
 
The proposed rule will have an impact on a substantial number of small entities.  The 
economic impact on those directly regulated by this rule would not be significant under the 
first three options.  DEA estimates that the direct first-year costs to practitioners for in-person 
identity proofing, training, and log review will range from about $150 to $350, which 
represents less than 0.2 percent of the net income of the lowest paid physician.  DEA cannot 
accurately estimate the incremental cost to the systems that will be passed on to practitioners 
and pharmacies because that cost will depend on how many customers each service provider 
has and how they finance their costs, but these costs are unlikely to be higher than the first-
year costs and should decline over time as the industry consolidates and costs can be 
April 2008 ii   
 recovered from a larger practitioner base.  For pharmacies, the incremental cost that their 
service providers may pass on would be less than $100 in the first year and about $35 a year 
in the out years, which represents about 0.003 percent of the average independent 
pharmacy’s annual sales.  DEA, therefore, has determined that the proposed rule would not 
impose a significant economic impact on small entities directly regulated by DEA. 
 
Service providers are not directly regulated by DEA.  The proposed rule indirectly affects 
them because DEA would require that its registrants use only systems and service providers 
that meet its requirements.  DEA recognizes that the requirements may impose a significant 
impact on service providers, many of which are small entities, but the costs are not so great 
that a service provider would not be able to recover them from customers or that the 
incremental price increase would discourage customers from purchasing a system.  DEA 
expects that some service providers may drop out of the market if they cannot meet the 
security standards that an auditor would demand, but given other government requirements 
for security under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the public’s 
expectations for secure medical records, DEA believes that these service providers would not 
be able to meet the other standards and public expectations.  The market for healthcare 
information technology (IT) is evolving rapidly.  DEA anticipates that most of the current 
service providers will not be in this market by the time most practitioners have adopted 
electronic medical record (EMR) systems.  As the history of other IT applications has shown, 
over time, for reasons unrelated to DEA, a few systems will dominate the market; for the 
remaining service providers, DEA’s requirements will not be a burden.

 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1   BACKGROUND 
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)1, DEA is required to maintain a closed system 
of distribution for controlled substances.  DEA publishes the implementing regulations in 
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.2  These regulations are designed to ensure an 
adequate supply of controlled substances for legitimate medical and other purposes, and to 
deter the diversion of controlled substances to illegal purposes. 
 
Controlled substances include narcotics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and anabolic 
steroids that have a potential for abuse and psychological and physical dependence.  DEA 
divides controlled substances into Schedules I through V.  Schedule I substances have a high 
potential for abuse and no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and, 
therefore, may not be dispensed.  Schedule II through V substances have accepted medical 
uses and also have potential for abuse and dependence.  They may be dispensed; except for 
Schedule V substances, controlled substances cannot generally be dispensed except in 
response to a prescription. 
 
For Schedule II controlled substances, which have the highest potential for abuse and 
dependence of the medications with accepted medical uses in treatment in the United States, 
the CSA mandates that, except in emergency circumstances, a pharmacist may only dispense 
a Schedule II controlled substance if there is a written prescription from a practitioner.  For 
patients in long term care facilities or hospices, prescriptions for Schedule II substances may 
be written and manually signed and faxed with the fax serving as the original prescription.  
Most Schedule II prescriptions, however, are written with the original prescription presented 
to the pharmacy before dispensing.  Schedule II prescriptions may not be refilled; a new 
prescription must be issued.  For Schedule III and IV controlled substances, the pharmacist 
may dispense if there is a written or oral prescription from a practitioner; faxed prescriptions 
may serve as the original prescription, but must be written and signed prior to being faxed.  
Regulations implementing the prescription requirements are found in 21 CFR part 1306. 
 
Under the regulations, a prescription for a controlled substance may be issued only by an 
individual practitioner who is authorized to prescribe by the State in which he or she is 
licensed to practice and is registered with DEA, or exempted from registration.  To be valid, 
the prescription must be written for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual 
practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice.  Every controlled substance 
prescription must contain the name and address of the patient, the drug name, strength, 
dosage form and quantity, directions for use, and the name, address, and DEA registration 
number of the practitioner.  Every prescription that is written must be dated as of, and signed 
on, the day it is issued.

 A prescription may be filled only by a pharmacist acting in the usual course of professional 
practice who is employed in a registered pharmacy.  The prescribing practitioner is 
responsible in case the prescription does not conform in all essential respects to the law and 
regulations.  A corresponding liability rests upon the pharmacist who fills a prescription not 
prepared in the form prescribed by DEA regulations. 
 
With respect to records, the pharmacy must maintain a paper file of all prescriptions, 
consisting of the original prescriptions, or, where allowed, the facsimiles of the original 
written prescriptions, or written documentation of oral prescriptions.  The pharmacy must 
also maintain records of when the prescription was filled and by whom, for both original 
prescriptions and any partial fillings or refillings.  Practitioners are not required to maintain 
copies of prescriptions written or other records of prescriptions (unless issued for 
maintenance or detoxification treatment).  Consequently, although practitioners create the 
record, pharmacies maintain it.  This division between the person who creates the record and 
the person who retains it makes the integrity of the record particularly important. 
 
Diversion of controlled substances may occur in a number of ways.  With prescriptions, 
diversion may take place if a practitioner knowingly or otherwise writes a prescription for a 
person who does not have a legitimate need for it.  Prescriptions may also be altered (e.g., 
changing a “10” to “40” or “100”) or forged.  Prescription pads may be stolen to create 
forgeries or prescriptions may be used to create fake prescription forms.  Pharmacy records 
can be altered to hide illegal dispensing or theft by pharmacy employees.  Practitioners and 
pharmacists may illegally dispense substances. 
 
DEA’s recordkeeping requirements and its concern about its ability to determine the integrity 
of the prescription record are directed toward preventing diversion and having a legally 
defensible record to prove that diversion has occurred.  With paper prescriptions, the signed 
prescription provides a provable link to the prescribing practitioner.  Forgeries can usually be 
detected by handwriting experts.  As a result, a practitioner whose prescriptions are altered or 
forged can prove that he or she did not issue the suspect prescriptions, but a practitioner who 
issues invalid prescriptions cannot deny them and can be subject to administrative, civil, and 
criminal penalties.  Similarly, paper records held at pharmacies can be compared with 
pharmacy inventories to determine if all drugs dispensed were dispensed legally. 
1.2 ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTIONS 
 
Industry has asked DEA to develop regulations that will allow the creation and transmission 
of electronic prescriptions for controlled substances.  Many parties in the healthcare industry 
are encouraging the adoption of electronic prescriptions because such prescriptions have the 
potential to improve patient safety by reducing medical errors that arise from misread or 
misunderstood prescriptions.  From DEA’s perspective, electronic prescriptions have distinct 
advantages, if created in a way that reduces the possibility of forgery or alteration.  The 
reality of the speed of electronic communications, however, is that electronic prescriptions 
could also open a new avenue for rapid diversion, which could leave no trail that DEA could 
use to act against those diverting controlled substances.  A recent study conducted for the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) by the American Health Information 
April 2008 2  
 Management Association, “Report on the Use of Health Information Technology to Enhance 
and Expand Health Care Anti-Fraud Activities,” noted that “e-prescribing presents a new 
vulnerability because of the increased velocity of authenticated automated transactions.”3  
Electronic records are easy to create and relatively easy to alter without the alteration being 
detectable.  Without proper protections, a criminal could open an account, use a practitioner’s 
DEA number to generate a fake prescription, send it to multiple pharmacies over a wide area, 
have confederates pick up the drugs, and close the account within a few hours.  Because 
DEA registration numbers are publicly available, criminals could do this repeatedly without 
using any one DEA registration number more than once, making it unlikely that pharmacists 
would notice a pattern.  Without proper controls, electronic prescriptions could create the 
potential for organized, widespread, and undetected diversion of controlled substances. 
 
To the extent that electronic prescriptions for noncontrolled substances are being issued at 
present, they are signed electronically, with personal identification numbers (PINs) or using 
some combination of passwords and user IDs and transmitted over closed networks or the 
Internet through three to five intermediaries who may open the prescription files to reformat 
them and add information, such as routing and payer data.  Reformatting is often required if 
the pharmacy system is not compatible with the practitioner’s prescribing system.  The 
service providers authorize the practitioners to use the system.  Some systems allow 
practitioners to enroll online, without any assurance that the person is who he or she claims 
to be.  Some systems authorize anyone in the practice to use the system so that the system 
cannot link a specific practitioner to a prescription.  At the pharmacy, the prescription 
translates directly into the pharmacy computer system, and the records are maintained 
electronically. 
 
This existing electronic prescription system is not sufficient to protect the transactions as the 
CSA requires.  From DEA’s perspective, the existing system has several fundamental flaws. 
 
 The system relies on service providers to authenticate practitioners and control the 
integrity of the transaction without ensuring that the service providers check the 
identity of the practitioner, limit access for prescription signing, or use 
authentication protocols that allow only authorized practitioners to sign a 
prescription.  In addition, the service providers are not subject to security 
requirements for their own systems.  DEA would have to prove that the third party 
was not at fault before it could successfully take action against a registrant who 
had been a party to diversion.  For example, if a practitioner denied issuing 
prescriptions and claimed they had been forged, DEA would have to prove that 
the third party had not issued authorization to someone else to use the 
practitioner’s name and DEA registration number and that none of the third 
party’s employees or outside hackers had used the system to generate false 
prescriptions in the practitioner’s name.

the Use of Health Information Technology to Enhance and Expand Health Care Anti-Fraud Activities,” 
prepared for the Office of the National Coordinator, US Department of Health and Human Services, September 
30, 2005. 
April 2008 3  
  The system does not provide for record integrity.  Even a closed transmission 
network does not protect against insider actions.  Many computer crimes, such as 
identity thefts, are committed by insiders who have the knowledge to overcome 
internal protections.  Because the third parties routinely open prescriptions, the 
opportunity for insider alterations will be substantial.  The systems may also not 
protect against determined outside hackers. 
 The system provides limited protection of the record’s integrity once it reaches the 
pharmacy. 
Overall, the existing electronic prescribing systems provide no assurance of security against 
identity theft, insider attacks, or outsider attacks.  Although some existing systems might 
have voluntarily implemented effective security measures, they are not legally obligated to 
do so and – in the absence of binding regulatory requirements – there is no way to ensure that 
they or others who might enter the market will have effective measures in the future.  With 
prescriptions moving through multiple parties from creation to dispensing, a security failure 
at any link in the chain could undermine the entire system, often leaving no evidence of the 
problem. 
1.3   OPTIONS CONSIDERED  
 
DEA has analyzed four options to consider the impact of varying requirements to address its 
concerns and provide adequate security.  Under the Base Case, the following would be 
required: 
 
 The electronic prescription service provider would conduct in-person identity 
proofing.  At the service provider’s office, a clerk would check the registrant’s 
State license and DEA registration to ensure that they are active and in good 
standing and enter an electronic record of the check, and then file the original 
hard copy of the proofing document.  The service provider would keep a record of 
the identification checked, the person who checked it, and the date on which it 
was checked. 
 Authentication:  Access to the electronic prescribing system for the purposes of 
signing prescriptions for controlled substances would meet the standards for Level 
4 authentication in NIST SP 800-63.  That is, the system would require at least 
two-factor authentication to access the system; one factor would be on a hard 
token that meets the requirements for Level 4 authentication in NIST SP 800-63. 
 The security of the system would be audited annually using an independent third-
party audit that meets the requirements of a SysTrust or WebTrust audit for 
security and processing integrity. 
 The system would limit signing authority to those practitioners that have a legal 
right to sign prescriptions for controlled substances (i.e., the system would set 
varying levels of access to the system based on responsibilities). 
 The system would have an automatic lock out if the system is unused for more 
than 2 minutes. 
April 2008 4  
  The prescription would contain all of the required data (date of issuance; patient 
name and address; registrant full name, address, DEA registration number; drug 
name, dosage form, quantity prescribed, and directions for use; and any other 
information specific to certain controlled substances prescriptions mandated by 
law or DEA regulations).  Prior to signing the controlled substance prescription, 
The system would show the prescribing practitioner at least the patient name and 
address, drug name, dosage unit and strength, quantity, directions for use, and the 
DEA registration number of the prescriber whose identity is being used to sign the 
prescription. 
 Where more than one prescription has been prepared for signing, prior to 
authenticating to the system the practitioner would positively indicate which 
prescription(s) are to be signed. 
 The practitioner would authenticate himself to the system immediately before 
signing a prescription. 
 After authenticating to the system but prior to transmitting the prescription, the 
system would present the practitioner with a statement indicating that the 
practitioner understands that he is signing the prescription being transmitted.  If 
the practitioner does not so indicate, by performing the signature function, the 
prescription could not be transmitted. 
 The system would transmit the electronic prescription immediately upon 
signature.  The system would not transmit a controlled substance prescription 
unless it is signed by a practitioner authorized to sign such prescriptions. 
 The electronic data file would include an indication that the prescription was 
signed. 
 The system would not allow printing of prescriptions that have been transmitted; 
if a prescription is printed, it would not be transmitted.   
 The system would generate a monthly log of controlled substance prescriptions 
and transmit it to the practitioner for his review.  The practitioner would indicate 
that the log was reviewed. 
 The first recipient of the prescription would digitally sign the prescription and 
archive the digitally signed prescription as received. 
 The first pharmacy system that receives the prescription would digitally sign and 
archive a copy of the prescription as received.  Alternatively, the intermediary that 
transmits the prescription to the pharmacy could digitally sign the transmitted 
prescription and transmit both the record and the digitally signed copy for the 
pharmacy to archive. 
 The pharmacy system would check to determine whether the DEA registration of 
the prescribing practitioner is valid.  (Alternatively, any of the intermediary 
systems could conduct this check provided that the record indicates that the check 
has been conducted.  The CSA registration database could be cached for one week 
from the date of issuance by DEA of the most current database.) 
April 2008 5  
  The pharmacy system would be able to store the complete DEA number including 
extensions. 
 The pharmacy system would have an audit trail that identifies each person who 
annotates or alters the record.  The pharmacy system would conduct daily internal 
audits to identify any auditable events. 
 The system would have a backup system of records stored at a separate location. 
 The pharmacy system would have an independent third-party audit that meets the 
requirements of SysTrust or SAS 70 audits for security and processing integrity. 
 A prescription created electronically for a controlled substance would remain in 
its electronic form throughout the transmission process to the pharmacy; 
electronic prescriptions may not be converted to other transmission methods, e.g., 
facsimile, at any time during transmission. 
 
Many existing electronic prescription and pharmacy systems already meet some or all of 
these requirements. 
 
In Option 1, the mechanism for in-person identity proofing is changed along with some of the 
ancillary procedures.  The identity proofing would not be conducted by the service provider 
but by a DEA-registered hospital, State licensing board, or State or local law enforcement 
agency.  The analysis assumes that in the great preponderance of cases, the identity proofing 
would be conducted by the hospital.  Identity proofing of a registrant would be recorded in a 
hard document with signatures of the registrant and the agent who conducted the in-person 
identity proofing.  The original document would be mailed from a practitioner’s office to the 
service provider.  At the service provider’s office, a clerk would check the registrant’s State 
license and DEA registration to ensure that they are active and in good standing, and enter an 
electronic record of the check, as in the Base Case, and then file the original hard copy of the 
identity proofing document.  The service provider would phone the applicant to verify the 
submission of the application.   
 
There is no change in the two-factor authentication or other requirements from the Base 
Case. 
 
In Option 2, the authentication protocol is changed to require the registrant’s digital 
signature, which is created by use of a digital certificate issued by a federally recognized 
Certification Authority.  The original document recording in-person identity proofing would 
be stored at the Certification Authority’s office rather than at the service provider’s office; 
checking of the State license and DEA registration would be done at the service provider’s 
office.  The service provider would archive the digitally signed prescription, but would not be 
required to digitally sign the prescription on receipt.  The digital signature would not be 
transmitted to the pharmacy.  Because security now depends on the digital signature and 
digital certificate, and not on the service provider’s system, systems would not have to be 
audited for security—only process integrity, a less intensive and less costly audit.  The 
monthly log check would also be eliminated.  The other requirements are the same as the 
Base Case. 
April 2008 6  
  
Option 3 imposes no requirements for identity proofing, authentication, or system attributes.   
Instead, sole reliance for security is placed on a requirement for a callback from the 
pharmacy to the practitioner office for every electronic prescription for a controlled 
substance.

 CHAPTER 2: AFFECTED UNIVERSE 
 
 
 
The proposed rule potentially affects any person authorized under State law to prescribe 
controlled substances and registered with DEA as an individual practitioner or exempt from 
the requirement of registration.  It also directly affects registered pharmacies that process 
controlled substance prescriptions.  This chapter discusses estimates of the number of entities 
that would incur costs for compliance if they elect to issue or receive electronic prescriptions 
for controlled substances.  The rule would not require any registrant to issue or accept 
electronic prescriptions for controlled substances; paper and, where permitted, oral 
prescriptions are still allowed.

As of December 2007, DEA had 1.18 million registered individual practitioners.  Not all of 
these, however, are likely to prescribe controlled substances or do so often enough to justify 
any investment in an electronic prescription system.  For example, veterinarians, 
optometrists, animal shelters, ambulance services, etc. rarely if ever prescribe controlled 
substances.  Nurse practitioners and physicians assistants who work in hospitals or 
institutional settings may not prescribe controlled substances often.  Similarly, many 
physician specialties either do not prescribe any controlled substances (anesthesiologists, 
radiologists, pathologists) or do not often prescribe controlled substances as part of their 
usual practices (dermatologists, obstetricians/gynecologists, ophthalmologists).  In addition, 
many practitioners hold multiple DEA registrations because they practice in more than one 
State or dispense or administer controlled substances at multiple locations in a single State.  
Finally, some practitioners retain their registrations when they retire. 
 
To estimate the number of practitioners who may use electronic prescribing for controlled 
substances, DEA used its registration data plus a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) study of office-based physicians.4  The CDC study used data from the American 
Medical Association (AMA) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), which 
indicated that there were 489,829 physicians engaged in non-federal office-based care.5  The 
study found that a third of those were out-of-scope because they were hospital-based, 
federally employed, anesthesiologists, radiologists, pathologists (11.3 percent), retired or 
deceased (9.5 percent), non-office-based (4.7 percent), not practicing (4.4 percent) and 
otherwise ineligible (3.9 percent).  The study estimated that there were 311,200 office-based 
physicians in 2004.  DEA used this estimate as its baseline for physicians although the 
estimate includes a number of specialties that may rarely prescribe controlled substances.  
Adjusting the number for growth to 2007, DEA estimates that 312,135 physicians may now 
be writing controlled substances prescriptions.

2004,” Series 13, Number 164. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. January 2007. 
5 Practitioners were limited to office-based because hospital-based practitioners do not usually write 
prescriptions and neither hospital-based nor federally employed practitioners would be purchasing electronic 
prescription systems. 
April 2008 9  
  
The other three practitioner groups that are likely to prescribe controlled substances are 
dentists, nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants.  Because DEA had no basis for 
estimating the number of dentists that may hold multiple registrations or have retired, DEA 
used the number of currently registered dentists (170,969), recognizing that the estimate is 
probably slightly high.  For nurse practitioners and physicians assistants, DEA used its 
current registrant population (119,659) reduced by 25 percent to 89,744.  DEA reduced the 
number because many of these mid-level practitioners work in hospitals, where they are 
unlikely to write prescriptions.  For physicians assistants, only 63 percent work in office-
based practices according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics;6 DEA has no estimates 
of where nurse practitioners work because they are aggregated with all nurses in BLS data.  
Table 2-1 presents the estimate of total practitioners who could engage in electronic 
prescribing for controlled substances and the growth rate applied for estimating the number 
in each of the out-years. 
Table 2-1:  Practitioner Universe 
 
 Current number Future annual growth rate 
Physicians 312,135 0.1 percent 
Dentists 170,969 0.9 percent 
Mid-level practitioners 89,744 2.2 percent 
Total 572,848 0.7 percent 
 
Estimated growth rates are based on recent trends.  Regarding physicians, the trend since 
2000 indicates a very slight negative growth rate.  DEA does not believe this downward trend 
will continue; therefore, an annual growth rate for physicians of 0.1 percent has been 
estimated.  The growth rate for dentists is based on the annual growth rate of DEA 
registrations for dentists from 2003 to 2007.  The growth rate for mid-level practitioners is 
based on CDC data for increases in physicians assistants employment from 1999 to 2004.  
Nurse practitioners are a subset of nurses; employment of nurses grew 1.2 percent annually 
over that period.7  Using the 2.2 percent growth rate is, therefore, slightly conservative.  The 
rate for the total number of practitioners is the weighted average of the separate rates. 
 
Part of the cost of initial in-person identity proofing depends on the number of practitioners’ 
offices.  The 2002 Economic Census reports 321,423 offices of physicians and dentists 
(203,118 physicians’ offices and 118,302 dentists’ offices.)8  Consonant with DEA’s 
estimate of the number of physicians likely to write controlled substances prescriptions, the 
number of physicians’ offices is reduced by 25.0 percent and added to the dentists’ offices to 
obtain 270,664 offices in 2002 where practitioners were likely to write controlled substances 
prescriptions.  Using the 1997 and 2002 Economic Census,9 DEA obtained the weighted

 annual growth rate for these offices from 1997 to 2002—0.77 percent.  DEA used that rate to 
estimate the number of practitioners’ offices for this analysis in 2007—280,929 and to 
project the future growth of these offices. 
 
According to the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, there are about 57,000 retail 
pharmacies in the United States.10  Of these, about 40,000 stores are owned by chains.  Since 
there are about 200 pharmacy chains in the United States, there are about 17,200 retail-
pharmacy firms. 
2.2 SYSTEM PROVIDERS 
 
There is more than one kind of system provider, and confusion can arise if clear distinctions 
are not made among them.  It is necessary to establish a clear terminology before addressing 
the universe of system providers. 
 
A system provider is any firm that provides practitioners’ offices or pharmacies with the 
services and software required for transmitting or processing electronic prescriptions.  
System providers can be described in several ways.  Providers may install systems on 
practice computers and servers, or they may install software needed to link the practice to the 
service provider’s systems.  The latter are called application service providers (ASPs).  An 
ASP system is usually less expensive initially because the practice does not need to purchase 
servers to store records and because trouble-shooting occurs at the ASP level rather than at 
the practice.  Reprogramming can be done without needing to install patches or new software 
at the practice.  ASPs also have the advantage that they can be accessed from any location 
through the Internet.  Installed systems are more costly at least in the early years because 
they require more hardware and more on-site support.  ASPs, however, may carry higher 
annual maintenance fees. 
 
Systems may be further divided into two groups—those that provide only electronic 
prescription services (stand-alone systems) and those that provide electronic prescriptions as 
part of an electronic medical record system (EMRs).  These may be referred to as e-
prescription providers and EMR providers.  The latter group is by far the larger; DEA 
expects the e-prescription providers to disappear over time because most practices 
transitioning to electronic records want a system that can integrate all of its records rather 
than just handle one function.  Although most stand-alone e-prescription systems are ASPs, 
EMRs may be either ASPs or installed systems. 
 
Prescriptions at pharmacies are handled by a pharmacy management system.  These systems 
may be ASPs or installed systems.  The largest chains generally maintain a centralized 
system that links all of their stores, functioning in effect as an ASP for the chain. 
 
DEA estimated the number of electronic prescribing providers by combining the list of 
providers certified by SureScripts with the list of EMR system providers certified by the 
Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT) in December 
                                                 
10  www.nacds.org/user-assets/pdfs/facts_resources/2006/Retail_Outlets2006.pdf 
April 2008 11 
 2007.11, 12  The CCHIT list was used because any system certified under CCHIT must 
support electronic prescribing.  Overall, 119 firms were listed.  The number may be slightly 
high because some firms may be listed as both firms and software systems.  Of the 119, 103 
are EMR systems; the remainder are electronic prescription systems.  Of the EMR systems, 
86 are certified by CCHIT.  SureScripts certifies 66 systems, including all of the stand-alone 
systems.  The number of pharmacy system providers (20) is based on the number of these 
providers certified by SureScripts, which states that 95 percent of United States pharmacies 
are able to accept electronic prescriptions.  The number may be slightly high because a few 
of the certified systems may be transmission networks rather than pharmacy management 
systems.  Balancing that is the possibility that a few of the larger chain pharmacies may have 
their own systems, designed and maintained internally. 
 
Because the pharmacy systems are generally already in operation, DEA assumed that it is a 
mature market and the number of providing firms would remain at 20 throughout the 
implementation period.  A similar assumption cannot be made about the systems serving 
practitioners.  The market is evolving rapidly.  When DEA began considering electronic 
prescriptions for controlled substances, the majority of the firms were marketing e-
prescription services.  As the numbers above indicate, the great preponderance of firms is 
now selling EMR systems.  It is reasonable to assume that most, and perhaps all, of the 
electronic prescription systems will be sold to an EMR firm, incorporate EMR capability, or 
simply fail.  Similarly, it is likely that over the longer term, most of the EMR systems will 
not succeed in the competitive marketplace.  These systems are not only internally 
complicated, requiring considerable investment in ongoing technical support from the 
provider, but they also must be able to interoperate with systems used by testing laboratories, 
hospitals, insurance companies, pharmacies, clinics, and other medical practices.  In this 
situation, the tendency will be for a few systems to become dominant players and then 
replace the smaller systems because the dominant systems interoperate easily with other 
systems using the same basic platform.  As a recent study of the evolution of word 
processing systems found, of more than 400 such systems being sold in the mid-1980s, only 
a very few remained 10 years later.13
 
Because the ongoing cost of the rule is driven in part by the cost to providers, DEA needed to 
estimate the number of firms serving practitioners that would exist over time.  As discussed 
below under total costs, DEA projected that only 20 systems would remain in the market by 
the end of ten years.  DEA also estimated that in the first year, only 110 firms would comply 
with the rule.  This lower initial estimate (from the 119 firms certified) is based on the 
assumption that there are almost certainly too many firms competing for what is still a 
relatively small market; some will drop out rather than incur the effort and cost of becoming 
compliant with the rule. 
                                                 
11 SureScripts is a pharmacy industry organization that certifies electronic prescription and pharmacy systems 
that comply with the National Council for Prescription Drug Program SCRIPT standard; SureScripts 
certification indicates that the service provider’s systems will interoperate with other systems using the SCRIPT 
standard.  CCHIT establishes standards and certifies electronic medical record (EMR) systems.

A 2006 CDC study of EMR use found that only 12 percent of physicians reported having 
fully electronic EMR systems, which implies that the 103 EMR providers are vying for a 
market that has fewer than 40,000 practitioners.14  With the cost of building and maintaining 
a technically complex system, many existing firms are likely to run out of capital before they 
gain enough market share to be profitable, and the number of sellers in this market will 
continue to decline over time.

 CHAPTER 3: UNIT COSTS 
 
 
In estimating unit costs of the rule, the first step is to establish the baseline with which to 
determine the costs that are incremental with respect to the rule.  DEA presumes that no 
practitioner’s office will adopt electronic prescribing simply to write controlled substance 
prescriptions; controlled substances now constitute about 11.0 percent of the total number of 
prescriptions written annually in the United States.15  The costs to a practitioner’s office of 
complying with the rule, therefore, are only the system costs directly required by the 
electronic prescriptions for controlled substances rule and do not include any of the costs that 
the office would incur for setting up electronic prescription capability without controlled 
substances. 
3.1  REQUIREMENTS 
 
DEA is considering four variants on a rule to allow electronic prescription of controlled 
substances—the Base Case, and Options 1, 2, and 3.  The Base Case would impose the 
following requirements on an electronic prescription system: 
 
 In-person identity proofing imposes costs on practitioners and providers. 
 Two-factor authentication requires that each practitioner with authority to sign 
controlled substance prescriptions have a unique hard token to gain access to the 
system.  This imposes costs on some practitioners. 
 Monthly review of controlled substance prescription logs by practitioners imposes 
a cost on practitioners. 
 System requirements impose reprogramming costs on service providers. 
 Requirements for annual independent third-party audits impose costs on service 
providers. 
Effects of options: 
• Under Options 1 and 2 in-person identity proofing also imposes costs on DEA-
registered hospitals, State licensing boards, or law enforcement agencies; costs to 
practitioners rise because of the greater time required. 
• Option 2 does not require log reviews. 
• Option 2 requires that each registrant have a digital signature, generated by a digital 
certificate issued by a federally approved Certification Authority.  This imposes costs 
on practitioners’ offices. 
• Option 2 imposes lower costs for independent third-party audits. 
                                                 
15  The 11 percent is based on the percent of the top 200 brand name prescriptions filled (number of 
prescriptions, not value) and top 200 generic prescriptions that DEA identified as controlled substances. The 
analysis assumes that the remaining prescriptions (about one sixth of total prescriptions) will have the same 
proportion of controlled substance prescriptions as the top 400 do. 
April 2008 15 
 • Option 3 has none of the above requirements.  Instead, sole reliance for security is 
placed on a requirement for a callback from the pharmacy to the practitioner office 
for every electronic prescription for a controlled substance received.  This imposes 
costs on pharmacies and practitioners’ offices. 
3.2  COSTS 
3.2.1  IDENTITY PROOFING 
 
Base Case: 
 
Identity proofing under the Base Case requires a face-to-face meeting between each 
practitioner who will use the system and a representative from the service provider.  The 
meeting would take two minutes of the practitioner’s time (to show the provider a 
government-issued photographic identification) and the service provider’s time to look at the 
identification and make a record of the type of identification seen.  For each practitioner, an 
information clerk would spend another eight minutes at the service provider’s office 
verifying that the practitioner’s State license and DEA registration are active and in good 
standing, and entering the practitioner’s data into the service provider’s record of identity 
proofing.  In many cases, the service provider would meet practitioners while on a visit to the 
practitioner’s office that would have been made for other purposes (e.g., installation, training, 
trouble-shooting).  In some cases, however, the visit would be made for no other purpose 
than the identity proofing itself, particularly for some current electronic prescribing ASPs; in 
such a case, the service provider staff person’s travel time to and from the practitioner’s 
office would be a cost.  DEA assumes an average round trip of two hours.  Using a weighted 
average for practitioners’ wages (fully loaded) of $222.51, $83.80 for the service provider 
representative, and $33.89 for the service provider clerk, the cost of identity proofing is $7.42 
for practitioners, $2.79 for the service provider representative, and $4.52 for the service 
provider clerk.  Thus, the cost of identity proofing without travel is $14.73.  Two hours of 
travel adds $167.71, so the cost of identity proofing with travel is $182.34. 
 
Options 1 and 2: 
 
Identity proofing is conducted by a DEA-registered hospital, State licensing board, or State 
or local law enforcement agency—not by the service provider.  DEA assumes that the great 
preponderance of the identity proofing would be done at hospitals.  Since physicians 
routinely visit local hospitals, travel time to the hospital for a medical doctor is not included 
as a cost, but travel time for dentists and mid-level practitioners is regarded as incremental 
cost.  Average round trip to  a hospital is assumed as one hour.  The identity proofing session 
at the hospital would require ten minutes of a practitioner’s time and ten minutes for an agent 
of the hospital.  A hard document is generated and signed by both practitioner and hospital 
agent.  The document is mailed from the practitioner’s office to the service provider’s office.  
For Option 2, the document would be mailed to the Certification Authority.  Mailing requires 
two minutes of a secretary’s time plus postage.  As in the Base Case, a clerk at the service 
provider’s office takes eight minutes to ensure that the practitioner’s State license and DEA 
registration are active and in good standing, and enter the data into the record.  But, under 
April 2008 16 
 Options 1 and 2, the service provider’s clerk also calls the practitioner’s office to verify the 
application.  This requires three minutes for the service provider clerk and one minute for the 
practitioner.  Finally, the service provider clerk takes another two minutes to file the 
document. 
 
For each identity proofing, then, 11 minutes are needed for the practitioner, ten minutes for 
the hospital agent, 13 minutes for the service provider clerk, and two minutes for the 
practitioner secretary.  Full hourly cost for the hospital agent is $35.55, for the medical 
secretary, $30.33.  Additional costs are $0.41 for postage and annual storage cost (in a 
standard filing cabinet) at the service provider’s office of $0.0116.

Travel for service provider representative 2 hours $83.80 $167.61 
Total without travel   $14.73 
Total with travel   $182.34

MD (no travel)   $63.84

In Option 2, the hard copy of the identity proofing document is stored at the office of the 
Certification Authority rather than the service provider’s office, but that does not change the 
cost. 
3.2.2  TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION 
 
This requirement is the same for the Base Case and for Options 1 and 2.  Two-factor 
authentication requires that access to the system can be gained only using a combination of a

 hard token, which holds the practitioner’s private cryptographic key or one-time-password 
and a password.  A number of devices may serve this purpose: e.g., PDAs, Blackberries, 
thumb drives, smart cards, multi-factor one-time-password devices.  It is assumed that 
physicians and dentists will already have a PDA and be familiar with its use.  The same 
cannot be assumed for mid-level practitioners.  DEA assumes that tokens would have to be 
purchased for 75.0 percent of mid-level practitioners and those mid-level practitioners would 
require training in the use of the tokens.  For mid-level practitioners, the tokens would be 
thumb drives.  Time required for training is estimated to be ten minutes per mid-level 
practitioner.  Using the hourly wages (including fringes and overhead) for physician’s 
assistants of $76.94, the training cost is estimated to be $12.82.  A thumb drive costs $12.00; 
total unit cost for mid-level practitioners only: $24.82. 
 
DEA has not considered the cost of using two-factor authentication prior to signing because 
the actual authentication is no different, from the practitioner’s point of view, from entering a 
password as persons that use electronic prescription systems already do.  The protection in 
two-factor authentication is the storage of part of the authentication protocol on the hard 
token; the actual authentication does not add steps for the practitioner signing a prescription 
electronically although it may alter when the practitioner authenticates to the system. 
3.2.3 DIGITAL CERTIFICATES 
 
An approved Certification Authority would charge each practitioner an annual fee of $30.00 
for issuing a digital certificate for a digital signature.  The costs for digital certificates vary 
from less than $20 a year to $80 or more depending on the security features. 
3.2.4  MONTHLY REVIEW OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIPTION LOGS 
 
This is the same for the Base Case and Option 1.  There is no log review in Option 2.  Once a 
month, each practitioner would review the log of his controlled substance prescriptions for 
that month.  DEA is not proposing to require a comprehensive review or a cross-check with 
medical records.  Rather DEA is proposing that the practitioner check the log for obvious 
anomalies – prescriptions for patients he did not see, prescriptions for substances he 
generally does not prescribe, prescriptions for quantities that seem abnormal.  DEA estimates 
that a practitioner can review the log for obvious anomalies in an average of two minutes.  
Although some practitioners will need more time than that, there will be a significant number 
of practitioners who write few, or no, controlled substance prescriptions in any given month.  
The average cost is estimated to be $7.42 per month or $89.01 per year, using a weighted 
hourly wage for all practitioners. 
3.2.5  PROGRAMMING COSTS 
 
As shown in Table 3-1, a number of the proposed requirements would necessitate 
reprogramming by some or all of the existing service providers.  Any system currently able 
to transmit prescriptions electronically should be complying with the NCPDP SCRIPT 
standard, which includes fields for all of the basic prescription data elements that DEA 
requires.  If any existing program is not transmitting those elements (e.g., practitioner or 
April 2008 18 
 patient address), their programs should nonetheless already be capable of doing so with little 
effort because the fields already exist in the program.  Some of the additional requirements, 
such as the pop-up screen prior to signing, should require relatively minor programming.  
Similarly, any ASP that does not have an automatic time-out function can add it relatively 
easily.  Any system provider that conducts secure transactions over the Internet will already 
have a digital certificate and have done the programming needed to implement digital 
signing; they will need to program to sign these prescriptions, but the more complex 
programming for adding the digital signing functionality should already exist.  The more 
complicated programming may be adding access limitations where they do not currently exist 
and adding two-factor authentication with a cryptographic key.  Systems that do not support 
these functions may need more substantial reprogramming. 
 
Table 3-3 presents detail on the individual requirements that affect programming costs.  The 
items in italics are those that will require few, if any, entities to incur such costs. 
Table 3-3:  System Requirements 
 
Requirement Current practice 
Two-factor Level 4 
authentication 
EMRs certified by CCHIT must support 2-factor authentication.17  Most 
EMRs have this capability.  E-prescribing systems may need to 
reprogram to require cryptographic keys. 
Limit access to 
signing function 
EMRs certified by CCHIT must do this.  Many stand-alone systems also 
already do this.  Some systems may need to add this functionality. 
Automatic lockout 
after a period of 
inactivity 
EMRs certified by CCHIT must do this.  Most systems may have this 
function.  For ASPs, the programming is relatively simple. 
Prescription must 
contain all DEA data 
elements 
All systems should already have this capability.  All of the required 
elements are included in SCRIPT.  If any system does not include all of 
these elements, it would have to reprogram. 
Present the required 
data elements to the 
practitioner 
Most systems present the full prescription information on a single 
screen. 
Indicate that each 
prescription is ready 
to be signed 
Some existing systems already do this, requiring practitioners to check 
off each prescription they want to sign.  Others may need to reprogram 
to include this function. 
Authenticate to the 
system just before 
signing 
Unclear when current systems require authentication.  At least one 
requires entry of separate password to sign.  Most may need to 
reprogram to apply this function at signing. 
Transmit immediately 
upon signature 
May be common practice in existing systems because signing is the 
equivalent of transmitting.  Some systems may need to reprogram to add 
this function. 
Do not transmit if 
printed; do not print if 
transmitted 
May be a new function for most systems.  (This requirement does not 
prevent printing a copy of a medical record.)  Systems may need to 
reprogram.

At least one service provider is already doing so.  Service providers all 
have digital certificates and the capability to sign records digitally.  They 
will need to reprogram to include the function. 
Do not convert to fax if

May alter existing practice for some intermediaries.  HHS has proposed 
removing an exemption from the SCRIPT standard for faxes. 
No alteration of the

transmission except 
for formatting 
Industry says this does not happen so requirement should not impose a 
burden. 
First pharmacy (or last 
transmitter) digitally 
signs the prescription 
as received 
Intermediaries and at least some pharmacy system providers have digital 
certificates and the capability to sign records.  Any system that conducts 
secure transactions on the Internet will have digital signature capability.  
They may all have to reprogram to add the signing function. 
Check the validity of 
the prescriber’s DEA 
registration 
(Pharmacy) 
Many pharmacies already check the DEA registration database for 
registration information.  This will probably require some 
reprogramming to automate the check for each prescription. 
Store all of the DEA 
data in the pharmacy

Pharmacy systems already do this.  Some may have problems with 
extensions to DEA registration numbers.

(Pharmacy) 
Most systems have this capability. 
 
To estimate the cost of reprogramming, DEA divided the universe into systems that already 
implement many of the functions required and those that may not.  EMRs are assumed to 
support most of the functions that may require more extensive programming.  Stand-alone 
electronic prescription systems are assumed to need more programming to support two-factor 
Level 4 authentication and access limitations.  For pharmacies, those systems that operate as 
ASPs are assumed to require lower levels of programming because they will already have 
digital signature functionality; the rest of the systems are assumed to need to add digital 
signature functionality. 
 
Based on industry information presented to DEA when the Agency developed the Controlled 
Substances Ordering System, DEA estimated that adding digital signature functionality or the 
authentication/access limits would require about 2,000 hours of programming time to install 
and test.18  For systems that only need to add new screens or less complex instructions, DEA

http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ecomm/csos/csos_eia%2003112005.pdf. 
April 2008 20 
 estimated that they would need 500 hours of programming and testing.  DEA recognizes that 
these estimates are averages and that there will be considerable variability based on the 
functions that each system already has.  Some systems may already meet almost all or all of 
the requirements.  Others may require more extensive revision.  DEA notes that given the 
complexity of even electronic prescribing systems, which are usually designed to link to drug 
and formulary databases as well as in-house record systems (schedules/calendars, patient 
databases, billing, etc.), the elements DEA is requiring are relatively simple and do not alter 
any basic functions of the system.  For cost estimates, DEA assumes that systems with EMR 
capability and systems for providers to pharmacies will require 500 hours of reprogramming; 
systems for practitioners with capability only for electronic prescriptions will require 2,000 
hours. 
 
Given the hourly cost of a programmer of $73.24, 500 hours of reprogramming costs 
$36,619, and 2,000 hours costs $146,477.  Both levels of reprogramming would be needed 
under the Base Case and Option 1, according to capabilities of providers’ existing systems.  
Under Option 2, however, only 500-hour reprogramming would be required.  Because 
security would depend on the digital signature of a practitioner, complex authentication 
procedures would not be required for service providers’ systems. 
 
DEA also recognizes that the NCPDP SCRIPT standard itself will need revision to add an 
indication that the prescription has been signed.  The standard is being revised on a 
continuing basis; HHS testing of elements of the standard indicated that three of the six 
elements tested were not ready for implementation.  DEA, therefore, does not consider that 
the cost of what is a minor revision — designating one of the open fields to indicate that the 
prescription was signed — to impose any significant burden on the standard or on systems 
using the standard.  SureScripts and other intermediaries may also have to reprogram their 
systems to ensure that no controlled substance prescription file is converted into a fax if the 
electronic transmission fails.  These systems, however, are constantly adjusting to new 
service providers and existing service provider upgrades.  This change should not impose a 
burden on them.  DEA notes that transforming an electronic data file into a fax would create 
an illegal prescription because faxed prescriptions must be manually signed by the 
practitioner prior to transmission. 
3.2.6  AUDITING REQUIREMENTS 
 
For the Base Case and Option 1, all system providers that serve practitioners would be 
required to undergo an annual third-party security audit for system security, processing 
integrity, and compliance with the rule.  The audits would have to meet the standards of a 
SysTrust, WebTrust, or SAS 70 audit; these audit protocols are established and maintained 
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and are widely recognized and 
used in the commercial sector for IT systems.19  The same level of audit would be required 
for providers that serve pharmacies under the Base Case and both Options 1 and 2.  The level 
of audit for service providers to practitioners would drop under Option 2; reliance on the 
                                                 
19 For a description of these audits, see 
http://www.ffiec.gov/ffiecinfobase/booklets/audit/audit_06_3_party.html. 
April 2008 21 
 digital signature for security would lessen the need to audit for system security.  Only audits 
for processing integrity would be required for practitioner service providers under Option 2. 
 
The first audit for a service provider is generally more costly than subsequent audits because 
the auditors need to familiarize themselves with the system and document its elements.  
Subsequent audits, if conducted by the same audit firm, do not involve the same learning 
curve.  DEA estimates the following per-vendor costs for audits:  First-year audits: $125,000; 
subsequent audits: $100,000.  DEA notes that the costs of a SysTrust or SAS 70 audit range 
from $15,000 to $250,000 depending on the size of the company.  DEA used a conservative 
estimate of $125,000 for the initial audit although in many cases the cost for the DEA 
required audit elements would be less.  A full SysTrust or SAS 70 audit covers five areas; 
DEA is requiring that the audit address only two of those, physical security and processing 
integrity.  For Option 2 audits, addressing only processing integrity, DEA estimates annual 
audit cost of $25,000, including first-year audits.

Option 3 requires that a technician at the pharmacy call a practitioner’s office and speak to 
the prescribing practitioner for every electronic prescription of a controlled substance

technician, three minutes for a medical secretary who receives the call and retrieves the file, 
and one minute for the practitioner to look at the file and speak to the pharmacy technician.

 CHAPTER 4: TOTAL COSTS 
 
 
 
To proceed from unit costs to total costs, it is necessary to establish the frequency of 
occurrence of cost items and the distribution of those occurrences, and thus of costs, over 
time. 
4.1  NUMBERS OF PRACTITIONERS, OFFICES, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
The first step is selection of the time horizon for the analysis.  DEA has chosen 15 years for 
the period of the analysis.  DEA expects that full implementation of electronic prescriptions 
for controlled substances will require 15 years, i.e., at the end of the 15th year of the analysis, 
all practitioners’ offices will have controlled substance electronic prescribing capability in 
their IT systems. 
 
Fifteen years is essentially an estimate of the time required for implementation of electronic 
prescription and EMR systems.  As practitioners adopt EMR and electronic prescription 
systems, they will include electronic prescribing of controlled substances in the package, as 
the incremental cost of doing so for an office is very slight.  (Going forward, DEA expects 
few practices to buy electronic prescription systems without getting the entire package with 
EMR.)  Although the selection of the implementation period is somewhat arbitrary, DEA 
believes that 15 years is a reasonable estimate to reflect the balance between pressure from 
insurers, who want practitioners to implement EMR systems, and the reluctance of 
practitioners to invest in expensive systems that are time-consuming to implement and 
perhaps not yet fully tested.  The larger practices may well acquire EMR systems early on, 
but the practices with five or fewer physicians—which employ 74.5 percent of all 
practitioners—will take much longer to do so.20  It is reasonable to assume that for the 35.8 
percent of practitioners in solo practice, it could take at least 15 years before they adopt 
EMRs. 
 
To distribute costs over time, year by year, it is necessary to project the rate at which 
electronic prescribing systems will be implemented in practitioners’ offices.  Table 4-1 
shows the schedule at which DEA projects implementation over time.

Year 13 11.0 89.0 
Year 14 6.0 95.0 
Year 15 5.0 100.0 
 
The rate in Year 1 is somewhat higher than the rate in the next several years, because some 
percentage of offices has already adopted electronic prescription systems.  After dropping in 
Year 2, the rate rises gradually to a peak in Years 12 and 13 and then drops as full 
implementation approaches. 
 
Total costs for practitioners and some costs for providers will also be affected by the annual 
growth rates of the different classes of practitioners—0.1 percent for physicians, 0.9 percent 
for dentists, 2.2 percent for mid-level practitioners, and 0.7 percent for the weighted growth 
rate for all practitioners.  Table 4-2 shows the effect of the overall growth rate on number of 
practitioners and the combined effects of the implementation rate and the growth rate on the 
annual increment in the number of practitioners in offices with implemented e-prescription 
systems.

As noted in the chapter on unit costs, there are both start-up costs and ongoing costs driven 
by the number of practitioners.  Start-up costs incurred in each year will be based on the 
number of practitioners in offices implementing electronic prescriptions for controlled 
substances in that year plus new hires in offices that have already adopted controlled 
substances prescribing.  The combination of implementation and growth rates captures both 
the newly implementing offices and the new hires. 
 
Ongoing costs for practitioners will be based on the total number of practitioners in offices 
where electronic prescriptions for controlled substances has been implemented in a given 
year, i.e., the cumulative number of practitioners in offices that have adopted electronic 
prescribing of controlled substances. 
 
While most costs depend on number of practitioners, there are two exceptions for ASPs.  One 
has to do with office visits for in-person identity proofing (Base Case), the other with annual 
audits.  In some cases, as noted in Chapter 3, under the Base Case, ASP staff would have to 
visit practitioners’ offices for no purpose other than to conduct initial identity proofing.  In 
that case, an ASP staff person’s travel time to and from such offices is an incremental cost 
with respect to the rule, and the travel costs depend, in part, on the number of practitioners’ 
offices in which electronic prescriptions for controlled substances has been adopted.  Table 
4-3 shows DEA’s projection of the total number of practitioners’ offices and the year-by-year 
number of offices implementing electronic prescriptions for controlled substances.21  The 
EPCS implementation rate for offices is the same as the implementation rate for practitioners 
as shown in Table 4-1. 
 
                                                 
21 Growth rate is the weighted average of the growth rates of physicians’ and dentists’ offices based on the 
number of such offices in 1997 and 2002 as found in the 2002 Economic Census—0.77 percent for physicians’ 
offices, 0.71 percent for dentists’ offices, weighted average growth rate of 0.75 percent.

DEA believes that visits only for initial identity proofing would be made almost entirely by 
ASPs offering only electronic prescription systems, not EMRs.  A significant amount of 
work is required to set up and maintain an EMR system.  It is highly unlikely that, during the 
initial set-up of the system, EMR provider staff would be in a practitioner’s office with no 
task to perform other than identity proofing.  DEA expects that the electronic prescription 
system providers will disappear fairly quickly, either going out of business or expanding their 
services to include EMR.  As this happens, the percentage of initial visits made only for 
identity proofing will decline to zero by the end of Year 5.  This is shown in Table 4-4.

Regarding audit costs for system providers, total cost is a function of the number of 
providers.  DEA expects that there will be 110 firms offering services to practitioners’ offices 
in Year 1, and that this number will drop to 20 in Year 11 and stabilize at that level.  The 
number of providers serving pharmacies remains stable at 20 throughout the analysis period.  
Table 4-5 shows the projected number of providers to practitioners over the analysis period.

 4.2  START-UP COSTS AND ON-GOING COSTS 
 
Start-up costs are those incurred by an entity when it first implements electronic prescriptions 
for controlled substances and takes the steps needed to comply with the rule.  Under the 
assumptions of this analysis, all start-up costs will be incurred during the 15-year analysis 
period.  Ongoing costs are those incurred after initial implementation and which will 
continue indefinitely thereafter. 
 
Start-up costs for practitioners are the initial identity proofing and the purchase of hard 
tokens, and training in their use, for some of the mid-level practitioners.  The major ongoing 
cost is the monthly log review (absent in Option 2).  Under Option 2, the digital certificate is 
an ongoing cost for practitioners.  There is also some ongoing cost associated with turnover 
of personnel in practitioners’ offices.  When a practitioner moves to a new office, there is a 
high likelihood that the transfer will also be a move between providers; when that is the case, 
there must be a new identity proofing for that individual.  Transfers of mid-level practitioners 
are assumed to require new purchases of hard tokens. 
 
For providers, the start-up cost is the required reprogramming.  The major ongoing cost is the 
annual audit.  But providers also incur ongoing cost for identity proofing, both when a 
practitioner’s office adopts electronic prescriptions for controlled substances and in the case 
of identity proofing required when practitioners transfer between offices with different 
providers.  Most identity proofing costs are shifted from providers to hospitals in Options 1 
and 2.  Table 4-6 presents a summary of start-up and ongoing costs and the timing of each 
group of costs.

initial implementation in a practitioner office. 
These costs will accrue throughout 
the analysis period. 
 
All callbacks in Option 3 are ongoing costs. 
 
April 2008 30 
 Some further assumptions regarding these costs must be made to estimate total costs.  These 
are as follows: 
 
 For ongoing identity proofing visits due to personnel turnover, there is no 
incremental travel cost in the Base Case. 
 Percentage of personnel transfers between offices that are also transfers between 
service providers: 90.0 percent. 
 Annual turnover rate for physicians and dentists: 2.5 percent. 
 Annual turnover rate for mid-level practitioners: 5.0 percent. 
DEA assumes that ongoing identity proofing will not involve travel costs in the Base Case 
because provider staff may have to visit practices for other reasons, such as system upgrades, 
maintenance, and staff training.  Identity proofing can occur during those visits.  Identity 
proofing for transfers in Options 1 and 2 will still require travel to hospital for dentists and 
mid-level practitioners. 
4.3  TOTAL COSTS 
 
Table 4-7 shows the annualized costs over the analysis period for each of the four variants.  
The discounted present values over the analysis period are summed to yield present value of 
total cost for the period.  The present-value total is then annualized with a capital recovery 
factor to yield annualized total costs. 
Table 4-7: Total Costs ($) 
 
 7.0 percent 3.0 percent 
Base Case $32,561,452 $33,392,270 
Option 1 $38,256,015 $39,220,948 
Option 2 $18,594,831 $18,928,003 
Option 3 $1,280,040,536 $1,404,204,487 
 
 
Tables 4-8 and 4-9 show annualized costs of individual cost items for the Base Case and the 
three options with 7.0 and 3.0 percent interest rates.  For simplicity, start-up and ongoing 
costs have been combined for the same item, e.g., identity proofing includes both start-up and 
ongoing identity proofing.  Monthly log reviews are the largest single component of costs for 
the Base Case and Option 1.  It is the absence of log reviews in Option 2 that makes it the 
low-cost variant.  Annual audits for providers are large cost items.  All the other costs are 
relatively trivial compared to these items, except for the enormous cost of the call-backs in 
Option 3.

 CHAPTER 5: SMALL ENTITY ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601-612) (RFA), Federal agencies 
must evaluate the impact of rules on small entities and determine whether the rule will have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  This section discusses 
DEA’s analysis of the impact on small entities.  DEA emphasizes that the rule is voluntary.  
No businesses are required to comply with this rule unless they elect to issue or process 
controlled substance prescriptions as electronic data files; practitioners and pharmacies have 
the option to continue to use paper and, for Schedule III-V substances, oral prescriptions. 
5.1   CHARACTERISTICS OF SMALL ENTITIES 
 
As discussed in previous sections, the small entities directly affected by the proposed rule are 
practitioners and, to a limited extent, pharmacies.  The firms marketing services and software 
are not directly affected by the rule because they will recover their costs from practitioners.  
Nonetheless, DEA will discuss the impact on these firms.  Table 5-1 shows Small Business 
Administration’s standards for these firms.

Although some practitioners are part of large practices that may qualify as large businesses, 
so few practitioners fall into the large category that it is simpler to assume that they are all 
small entities.  It is also the case that the service providers generally charge on a per 
practitioner basis rather than a per practice basis so that the costs may be considered as 
applying to individual practitioners.  Mid-level practitioners are generally employed by a 
practice so their costs would be incurred by the practice, not the individual.  They are not, 
therefore, small businesses. 
 
April 2008 37 
 The lowest average net income for a physician in private practice listed in the Allied-
Physician Survey is $135,000.22  The American Dental Association states that the average 
net income of a dentist in private practice is $185,940 for a general practitioner.  The average 
gross billings for a dentist in general practice per dentist are $595,340.23  For pharmacies, the 
17,500 independent pharmacies are small entities; the other pharmacies belong to about 200 
chains that are mostly large firms.  There may be a few chains with fewer than 3 pharmacies, 
which could be small.  In 2006, National Association of Chain Drug Stores data indicate that 
the average independent pharmacy had prescription sales of $2.48 million a year; average 
total sales are about $2.675 million.24
 
As discussed in Chapter 2, DEA estimates that there are about 130 service providers (110 for 
electronic prescriptions, 20 for pharmacies) that will be indirectly affected by this rule.  A 
few of these are large entities or part of large companies (e.g., General Electric and 
McKesson).  DEA has no information on the revenues of most of these firms.  DEA notes 
that fully electronic EMRs cost between $20,000 and $50,000 per practitioner, with a usual 
monthly maintenance fee of $500 per practitioner.  A provider, therefore, would need fewer 
than 4,000 practitioners to qualify as a large business.  The providers of stand-alone 
electronic prescribing systems charge a tenth as much and are assumed to be small entities. 
5.2   SMALL ENTITY COSTS 
 
The costs to DEA registrants are relatively small.  As discussed in Chapter 4, the initial costs 
to the practitioner would range from about $62 to $266 for identity proofing, mostly for the 
time to have the identification checked.  The main ongoing costs for the proposed rule would 
be the monthly log review by practitioners (about $89 a year) plus any incremental cost of 
the software or service.  The initial and ongoing costs for the basic rule elements represent 
less than 0.2 percent of the annual income of the lowest paid practitioner.

April 2008 38 
 Determining the incremental cost of the system requirements per practitioner is difficult 
because it depends on the number of providers, the number of customers, the number of 
system requirements that a provider does not already meet, and how costs are recovered (in 
the year in which the money is spent or over time).  For example, an EMR system that had to 
reprogram to the full extent would have incremental system costs of $161,000 ($125,000 for 
the third-party audit and $37,000 for reprogramming).  If the service provider had 1,000 
practitioners enrolled in the first year, it would also incur about $5,660 for identity proofing.  
If the provider recovered the costs ($167,000) from its 1,000 customers, the incremental cost 
to those customers would be $167 or about $14 a month.  The costs in the out years would be 
lower because no further programming is needed and the audit cost is lower ($100,000).  If 
the provider added 1,000 practitioners a year over 15 years, the incremental cost per 
practitioner would fall as shown in Table 5-2.  The costs shown are conservative because the 
audits may cost considerably less depending on the complexity of the system; many EMRs 
may need little reprogramming.  Either or both of these factors in combination could reduce 
their costs considerably and, therefore, reduce the incremental costs to practitioners.

In the first year, the total cost to a physician for DEA’s requirements would be less than 
$300; dentists would have higher initial costs because of travel time.  After that, the cost will 
decline over time to about $100 to $150 a year including the incremental costs charged for 
the systems.  The lowest paid physician earns about $135,000 a year.  For none of the 
registrants will the cost represent a significant economic impact.   
For pharmacies, the only costs will be the incremental cost that their service provider charges 
to cover the costs of reprogramming and audits.  In the first year, if the providers recover the 
programming costs in a single year, the average incremental cost to a pharmacy would be 
$85.  After that, the incremental charge to recover the cost of the third-party audit would be 
$35 per pharmacy, assuming the cost is evenly distributed across all pharmacies.  The first 
year charge represents 0.003 percent of an independent pharmacy’s annual sales.  It also 
April 2008 39 
 represents a far lower cost than the pharmacy will pay SureScripts or another intermediary 
for processing the prescriptions.  Currently, SureScripts charges the pharmacy $0.215 per 
electronic prescription to process and reformat prescriptions to ensure that the pharmacy 
system will be able to capture the data electronically.  Based on National Association of 
Chain Drug Stores data on the average price of prescriptions ($68.26) and the average value 
of prescription sales, an independent pharmacy processes about 36,400 prescriptions a year 
and would have to pay SureScripts about $7,800.25
5.3 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
 
Although these costs do not represent a significant economic impact, as discussed above, 
DEA considered options.  The Base Case option would be less expensive initially, 
particularly for dentists and mid-level practitioners, because much less time would be needed 
for identity proofing.  Once the identity proofing has occurred, however, the costs would be 
the same for the Base Case and Option 1.  Option 2 would be less expensive for practitioners 
because the monthly log check would not be needed and the service provider costs would be 
lower because less stringent auditing requirements would be imposed, which would reduce 
the incremental costs recovered from the practitioner.   
 
DEA has not proposed the Base Case because of two concerns about identity proofing.  First, 
DEA is concerned that having a service provider employee conduct the in-person identity 
proofing would make it easier for insider collusion to occur.  Putting the in-person identity 
proofing in the hands of a DEA registrant or a public employee lessens that threat.  Second, 
others expressed a concern that service providers would not visit practitioners’ offices often, 
which could delay implementation and adoption, particularly for rural practices.  DEA is not 
proposing Option 2, the digital signature option, except for Federal healthcare systems 
because of the concerns expressed by industry with regard to the use of digital signatures and 
the problems they would create for intermediaries.  The third option, which would impose no 
costs on service providers, would be very expensive for pharmacies and practitioners.  If the 
average independent pharmacy processes 36,400 prescriptions, about 11 percent of those are 
likely to be for controlled substances.  Their annual cost for conducting callbacks on each of 
those would be about $5,200 in 2008; eliminating callbacks that already occur, the costs 
would be about $3,800 in 2008.  If the number of controlled substance prescriptions (359 
million original and newly authorized refills in 2008) were equally distributed among 
practitioners (about 573,000 in 2008), the average practitioner would incur costs of about 
$3,300 for callbacks under Option 3.  Eliminating the callbacks that already occur, the 
average practitioner would incur new costs of about $2,200 under Option 3.   
 
DEA has, therefore, determined that the proposed rule would not impose a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities directly subject to the rule.  Less 
expensive options are considered too burdensome by the service providers and 
intermediaries.  The option that would impose no burden on service providers would impose 
substantially higher costs on practitioners and pharmacies.

 5.4 OTHER ISSUES 
Another issue that DEA considered is whether the incremental costs might affect 
practitioners’ decisions about purchasing a system that provides electronic prescribing.  As 
discussed previously in this analysis, the market for these systems has shifted away from 
stand-alone systems to EMRs.  The cost of an EMR system for the functionalities that 
CCHIT requires ranges from $20,000 and $50,000 per practitioner with a usual annual 
maintenance charge of $6,000 per practitioner.  (There are some less expensive systems 
marketed as EMRs that have only some of the functions; some appear to provide billing, 
scheduling, and simple records, but none of the more complex functions such as electronic 
prescribing, database links, etc.)  Even in the first year, where the incremental cost of adding 
DEA’s requirements would be between $150 and $200, this additional charge is unlikely to 
affect the decision to invest in an EMR, where the first year cost would be, at the low end 
$26,000 ($20,000 plus the $6,000 maintenance fee).  The incremental costs would add less 
than 1 percent of the cost of the system; in the out-years, the incremental costs would 
similarly be a small fraction of the annual system maintenance cost.  For stand-alone 
electronic prescription systems, the initial incremental costs will be higher because they are 
expected to need more programming.  After the initial year, however, their incremental costs 
should be similar.  These costs will represent a greater percentage increase in their monthly 
charges, which average $50 per month, but this is unlikely to affect the initial decision 
because most of these systems are being provided free to practitioners by insurers that want 
to encourage electronic prescribing. 
 
DEA considers it unlikely that any provider would attempt to market a product or service that 
could not be used for controlled substance records and, therefore, no provider will be 
disadvantaged by complying because all providers will incur costs and recover them from 
customers.  The situation may be similar to certification of EMRs by CCHIT.  Some were 
concerned that the standards would create barriers, but most of the companies certified have 
been small.  The chairman of CCHIT, Mark Leavitt stated that the data on the revenues of 
firms that gained certification “laid to rest this concern that it was going to squeeze out small 
vendors.  It actually seems to have done the opposite.  It’s created a level playing field.”26   
 
DEA notes that the barriers to adoption of electronic prescribing cited in various government 
studies relate to the high cost of the systems, the disruption caused by implementing these 
systems, and the relatively early stage of system development and interoperability provided 
by the existing systems.  Despite the benefits of legible prescriptions, both in terms of patient 
safety and fewer callbacks from pharmacies, practitioners have resisted adoption of 
electronic prescriptions.  Insurance companies that have offered the systems for free have had 
difficulty finding practitioners willing to accept them because, while the service is free, the 
cost of additional hardware, training, and staff disruption is a barrier to adoption.  In 2005, 
Wellpoint offered physicians $42 million in hardware, software, and support.  "Of the 25,000 
physicians contacted, only 19,000 accepted these free gifts," Wellpoint then-CEO Leonard 
Schaeffer said.  "And of those 19,000, only 2,700 physicians chose e-prescribing PDAs.  The 
rest selected a paperwork reduction package. ... Free is not cheap enough," Schaeffer 
                                                 
26 California HealthCare Foundation, “Gauging the Progress of the National Health Information Technology 
Initiative: Perspectives from the Field.” January 2008. 
April 2008 41 
 concluded.27  The likelihood that the electronic prescribing systems will be part of EMR 
systems probably is also slowing adoption because practices do not want to invest in a stand-
alone system that will be redundant later. 
 
A study of physicians’ experiences with commercial electronic prescription systems that was 
funded by HHS and published in Health Affairs on April 3, 2007, examined the 
implementation of electronic prescribing.28  The study focused on larger medical practices 
(12 of the 21 practices had more than 50 doctors; none had fewer than 5), which meant that 
many of the practices had IT staff and support.  Many of the problems encountered involved 
not the basic function of writing a prescription, but other functions that are designed to 
improve patient safety (e.g., medication histories, clinical decision support) and formulary 
compliance.  Connectivity with pharmacies was also a problem.  Practice estimates of the 
number of prescriptions printed out for the patient ranged from 10 percent to close to 100 
percent.  Despite the theoretical level of pharmacy readiness for electronic prescriptions, 
“most practices using electronic fax or EDI [electronic data interchange] reported spending 
substantial time educating pharmacies about e-prescribing.”  Many practices noted that “at 
least some of the mail-order PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] routinely rejected 
prescriptions sent via electronic fax or EDI…” 
 
Implementing a system was reported to be very complicated.  One physician reported 
working with the IT department 4 hours a week for 6 months to iron out the “kinks” in the 
electronic prescribing module before the system could be tested.  Maintenance of the system 
continued to demand staff resources.  The study concluded: 
 
Much of the literature assessing barriers to electronic prescribing adoption and use 
has focused on cost, physician resistance, and changing practice workflow.  Our 
findings highlight the role of product limitations, external implementation challenges, 
and physicians’ preferences for how to use system features and are consistent with 
several other assessments of e-prescribing system functionality and provider 
pharmacy connectivity. 
 
Respondents’ implementation hurdles belie the view that electronic prescribing 
products are relatively simple “plug-and-play” applications.  It is hard to imagine that 
e-prescribing as it exists today can be the “killer app” that will drive further IT 
adoption.  All of the practices we examined, regardless of size, IT expertise, 
geographic location, or vendor, had invested many financial and human resources in 
implementing and maintaining e-prescribing. 
 
These findings are consistent with the CDC study cited above, which found that electronic 
prescribing was one of the less used functions in a fully or partially electronic EMR system.

 Creating an electronic prescription takes more time than writing a paper prescription and 
handing it to a patient.  The electronic prescription system shifts some responsibility from the 
pharmacy to the practitioners.  At present, it is the pharmacy that checks to see if a particular 
drug is covered by the patient’s insurance and that checks for drug interactions by examining 
other medications the patient is taking.  With electronic prescriptions, all of these checks may 
occur before the practitioner signs the prescription.  While this process may significantly 
reduce processing time at the pharmacy and ensure that more prescribed drugs are on the 
insurance companies’ formularies, it may substantially increase the time a practitioner must 
spend to create a prescription.  Rather than spending a few seconds writing a prescription 
while talking to the patient, the practitioner has to move through a series of drop-down 
menus to select the patient, drug, dosage unit, and directions, then determine whether the 
insurance company will cover it and at what level of co-pay.  Finally the practitioner will 
have to find the pharmacy from a drop-down menu.  Electronic prescriptions are likely to 
save practices staff time in reduced callbacks, but the practitioners may initially see mainly 
the additional time that needs to be spent creating the prescription and the office disruption 
that occurs when staff need to be trained on new systems.  (An earlier Rand study noted that 
although electronic prescriptions will eliminate errors caused by misread or misunderstood 
prescriptions, practitioners may not review the prescription to check that the right items from 
successive menus have been selected.  Electronic prescriptions may introduce new errors 
through system design flaws.  They may also reduce the likelihood that the pharmacy will 
check the prescription for errors.)29
 
Although the rule could impose a burden on the smallest service providers, the costs are not 
so great that a service provider would not be able to recover them from customers or that the 
incremental price increase would discourage customers from purchasing a system.  The 
programming that may be needed to implement a conforming system is not so onerous that a 
service provider would find it a significant burden; these firms are in the business of 
designing, programming, implementing, and upgrading software systems.  The cost of the 
annual third-party audit may be burdensome, but without the audit there is no assurance that 
the system is protected against identity theft and insider attacks, two of the most likely 
sources of diversion.  Some providers may drop out of the market if they cannot meet the 
security standards that an auditor would demand, but given other government requirements 
for security under HIPAA and the public’s expectations for secure medical records, these 
providers would not be able to meet other standards and public expectations.  The market for 
healthcare IT is evolving rapidly.  As discussed above, DEA anticipates that most of the 
current providers will not be in this market by the time most practitioners have adopted EMR 
systems.  Eventually, for reasons unrelated to DEA, a few systems will dominate the market; 
for these providers, DEA’s requirements will not be a burden.

 CHAPTER 6:  BENEFITS 
 
 
 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Electronic prescriptions are widely expected to reduce errors in medication dispensing 
because they will eliminate illegible written prescriptions and misunderstood oral 
prescriptions.  They are also expected to reduce the number of callbacks from pharmacy to 
practitioner to address legibility, formulary, and contraindication issues.  Electronic 
prescriptions may also reduce processing time at the pharmacy and wait time for patients.  
These benefits are likely to be mitigated to some extent.  As the Rand study suggested, 
practitioners may fail to review the prescription and notice errors that occur when the wrong 
item is selected from one or more drop-down menus; pharmacists may be less likely to 
question a legible electronic prescription.30  In addition, the formulary and contraindication 
checks are functions that practitioners sometimes disable because they do not work as they 
should or take too much time.31  Nonetheless, electronic prescriptions may provide benefits 
in avoided medication errors, reduced processing time, and reduced callbacks.  These 
benefits of electronic prescriptions are not directly attributable to this proposed rule except to 
the extent the rule facilitates implementation of electronic prescribing of controlled 
substances. 
6.2 QUANTIFIED BENEFITS 
 
DEA has quantified two types of benefits:  reduced number of callbacks to clarify 
prescriptions and the reduction in wait time for patients picking up prescriptions.  One of the 
greatest burdens in the paper system is the need for callbacks to clarify prescriptions.  
Clarifications and changes may be required for several reasons:  the prescription is not 
legible; required information is not included on the prescription; the prescribed dosage unit 
does not exist; the particular medication is not approved by the patient’s health insurance; 
and the drug prescribed is contraindicated because it reacts with other medications the patient 
is taking or because it negatively affects other conditions from which the patient suffers.  
Each callback involves the pharmacist and one or more staff at the practitioner’s office, often 
including the practitioner.  Electronic prescriptions will eliminate illegible prescriptions and 
should eliminate those with missing information or unavailable dosage units or forms.  
Whether the last two types of errors are eliminated will depend on the requirements of the 
software systems and the accuracy of the drug databases that they use.   
 
The public is also affected by the current system.  For the majority of controlled substance 
prescriptions, the patient (or someone acting for the patient) presents a paper prescription to 
the pharmacy and then waits for the pharmacy to fill it.  The time between the point when the

 prescription is handed to the pharmacist and the point when it is ready for pick-up is a cost to 
the public. 
 
To estimate the part of these benefits that may accrue to the proposed rule, DEA estimated 
the number of controlled substance prescriptions that may require callbacks.  Although there 
are widely varying estimates for callbacks, the best available data, based on the operation of 
the two largest mail order prescription pharmacies, support an estimate of 30 percent of 
original prescriptions.32  DrugTopics.com surveys of pharmacists in 199633 and 199934 
indicated that 80 percent or 95 percent of the prescription problems were of the type that 
electronic prescriptions could eliminate (illegible, missing information, or formulary).35  The 
analysis estimates that 90 percent of the callbacks could be eliminated with electronic 
prescriptions because data from current operations indicate that formulary issues have 
become a more prevalent cause of callbacks than was the case in the earlier surveys.36  
Overall, the analysis estimates that 27 percent of original prescriptions require callbacks.  
DEA assumes that electronic prescriptions would phase in at the same rate as practitioners 
(i.e., if 6 percent of practitioners had adopted electronic prescribing for controlled substances, 
then 6 percent of the controlled substance prescriptions would be electronic.)  Applying the 
cost of a callback as estimated for Option 3 ($6.58), Table 6-1 presents the annual data for 
the cost-savings from callbacks avoided over the 15 year implementation period.  Table 6-2 
presents the PV of the costs at 7 and 3 percent discount rates.

Assuming that electronic controlled substance prescriptions phased in over 15 years, as 
described above, the annualized time-saving for eliminating these callbacks would be $316 
million (at 7% discount) or $346 million (at 3% discount).   
 
Electronic prescriptions could also reduce the patient’s wait time at the pharmacy.  The 
number of original controlled substance prescriptions that could require public wait time is 
based on the estimated number of original prescriptions (approximately 328 million in 2008), 
reduced by 19 percent, to account for those prescriptions phoned to the pharmacy37 plus 
another 15 percent to remove those that are currently filled by mail order pharmacies or long-
term care facilities.38  Assuming the average wait time is 15 minutes for the 81 percent of 
original prescriptions that are presented on paper to retail pharmacies (not mail order or long-
                                                 
37 A 1999 Drugtopics.com survey indicated that 36% of all prescriptions were phoned in; because refills are 
usually authorized on the original prescription and do not require second calls, and slightly less than half of 
prescriptions are refills, the analysis uses 19% for phoned in prescriptions.

The annualized savings over 15 years would be $589 million (at 7% discount) or $646 
million (at 3% discount).   
 
The estimates for public wait time are upper bounds.  They assume that the practitioner will 
transmit the prescription and that the pharmacists will open the record and fill it before the 
patient arrives at the pharmacy.  It is probably more realistic to assume that only a fraction of 
these benefits will be gained particularly in the early years when pharmacies are still getting 
used to electronic prescriptions.  There may also be some offsetting costs to the pharmacy.  
The industry estimates that about 20 percent of prescriptions written are never presented to 
pharmacies.  If these are sent to pharmacies electronically and prepared before the patient 
arrives, the pharmacy will have spent time for which it will not be reimbursed if the patient 
does not pick up the prescription.  (It may be reasonable to expect the 20 percent to decline 
with electronic prescriptions, although probably not to zero.)   
 
Table 6-4 presents the annualized benefits at a 7 percent and 3 percent discount rate.

The benefits, both of which represent time savings, clearly exceed by a wide margin the costs 
of the Base Case and Options 1 and 2.  The costs of Option 3 at $1.3 to $1.4 billion a year 
exceed the benefits, which would not, of course, include callbacks eliminated. 
6.3 QUALITATIVE BENEFITS 
 
DEA is proposing additional security requirements for electronic controlled substance 
prescriptions to ensure that electronic prescriptions for controlled substances do not become 
an easy route for widespread and undetectable diversion of controlled substances.  Properly 
secure electronic prescribing systems have the potential to reduce prescription forgeries, 
which will protect practitioners from identity theft and misuse of their DEA registration 
numbers by practice staff and others.  Secure pharmacy systems may help identify diversion 
that occurs at pharmacies. 
 
DEA has not attempted to quantify or monetize the benefits of the proposed rule that relate to 
diversion because of a lack of data on the extent of diversion of controlled substances 
through forged or altered prescriptions and alteration of pharmacy records.  These benefits 
are, however, discussed qualitatively in this section.  The immediate cost of misuse of 
prescription controlled substances is also reviewed in terms of data on deaths and emergency 
room (ER) visits that result from nonmedical use of these drugs. 
6.3.1 REDUCTION IN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIPTION FORGERY 
 
Diversion of controlled substances through forgery, doctor shopping (where a patient visits 
more than one practitioner to receive prescriptions for the same controlled substance), and 
alteration of pharmacy records is a growing problem.  Controlled substances are diverted in a 
number of ways, some of which will not be affected by electronic prescriptions.  For 
example, diversion occurs when: 
 Controlled substances are stolen from practitioners and pharmacies.   
 Practitioners knowingly write non-legitimate prescriptions. 
 Practitioners write prescriptions for people who have lied about symptoms to 
obtain the drugs.  A commonly used term for these patients is “doctor shoppers,” 
people who routinely visit different doctors with the same ailment to obtain 
multiple prescriptions for controlled substances, usually pain relievers.  These 
prescriptions are then filled at various pharmacies and the drugs are abused or 
sold on the illicit market. 
Although DEA does not expect the proposed rule to eliminate these problems, it may act as a 
deterrent to practitioners who write non-legitimate prescriptions and to doctor shoppers 
April 2008 49 
 because it will be easier for States to monitor prescriptions when they are electronic through 
the use of State prescription monitoring programs.  Digitally signed prescription records will 
make it very difficult for a practitioner to claim that a prescription has been forged or altered.  
Some States are already using prescription monitoring programs to identify practitioners who 
prescribe unusual quantities of controlled substances and patients filling multiple 
prescriptions at different pharmacies. 
 
Electronic prescriptions for controlled substances will directly affect the following types of 
diversion: 
 Stealing prescription pads or printing them, and writing non-legitimate 
prescriptions. 
 Altering a legitimate prescription to obtain a higher dose or more dosage units 
(e.g., changing a “10” to a “40”). 
 Phoning in non-legitimate prescriptions late in the day when it is difficult for a 
pharmacy to complete a confirmation call to the practitioner’s office. 
 
These are examples of prescription forgery that contribute significantly to the overall 
problem of drug diversion.  DEA expects this rule to reduce significantly these types of 
forgeries because only practitioners with secure prescription-writing systems will be able to 
issue electronic prescriptions for controlled substances and because any alteration of the 
prescription at the pharmacy will be discernible from the audit log and a comparison of the 
digitally signed records.  DEA expects that over time, as electronic prescribing becomes the 
norm, practitioners issuing paper prescriptions for controlled substances may find that their 
prescriptions are examined more closely. 
6.3.2  COST OF DIVERSION AND ABUSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
 
A reduction in forged controlled substance prescriptions could result in a reduction in drug-
related deaths and medical care.  The 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and Health 
(NSDUH) found that 6.7 million people in the United States currently use prescription-type 
therapeutic drugs for nonmedical reasons.40  This nonmedical use of prescription drugs can 
lead to death and emergency room visits.  The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMHSA) runs the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), a public 
health surveillance system that monitors drug-related visits to hospital emergency 
departments and drug-related deaths investigated by medical examiners and coroners.  
SAMHSA reported that in 2003, in six States (Maine, Maryland, New Hampshire, New 
Mexico, Utah, and Vermont) there were 352 deaths from misuse of oxycodone and 
hydrocodone, both prescription controlled substances.41  The 32 metropolitan areas that are 
part of DAWN reported 3,530 deaths from misuse of oxycodone and hydrocodone and 1,381 
deaths that involved the misuse of benzodiazepines (Schedule IV controlled substances) in

 2003.42  These numbers do not include the 624 suicides that involved benzodiazepines or 
opiates other than heroin and methadone.)  The 32 metropolitan areas represent about 24 
percent of the United States population. 
 
In another report, SAMHSA stated that in 2004 there were 42,491 emergency room visits 
involving nonmedical use of hydrocodone, 36,559 visits for nonmedical use of oxycodone, 
and 144,000 visits for nonmedical use of benzodiazepines.43  By 2005, the number of 
emergency visits for nonmedical use of these drugs rose to 51,225 for hydrocodone, 42,810 
for oxycodone, and 172,388 for the benzodiazepines.  For all nonmedical use of prescription 
opiates except methadone, the number of visits was about 155,000.44  ER visits for all 
controlled substances except methadone represented 60 percent of the 598,542 ER visits 
involving nonmedical use of drugs.45   (With methadone, they represent 67 percent of these 
ER visits.)  About 33 percent of all ER visits for nonmedical use of drugs resulted in the 
person being admitted to the hospital; about 12 percent of ER visits resulted in the person 
being admitted to an intensive care unit. 
 
Using a value per life of $3 million, the costs of the 2003 deaths from misuse of prescription 
controlled substances in the six States is more than $1 billion.  The cost of the 2003 deaths 
from misuse of prescription controlled substances in the 32 metropolitan areas is more than 
$10 billion.  The cost of the 2005 emergency room visits is above $350 million (at $1,000 per 
visit), not including the cost of further in-patient care for those admitted.  These costs are 
some fraction of the total cost to the nation.  Nonetheless, they add to more than $11.35 
billion in one year.  DEA has no basis for estimating what percentage of these costs could be 
addressed by the proposed rule.  If, however, the proposed rule prevents even a small fraction 
of the deaths and emergency care the benefits will far exceed the costs.  DEA notes that, at 
7.0 percent, the total annualized cost of the rule is $38 million, 0.3 percent of $11.35 billion. 
 
These costs also do not represent all of the costs of drug abuse to society.  Drug abuse is 
associated with crime and lost productivity.  Crime imposes costs on the victims as well as 
on government.  DEA does not track information on controlled substance prescription drug 
diversion because enforcement is generally handled by State and local authorities.  The cost 
of enforcement is, however, considerable.  In 2007, DEA spent between $2,700 for a small 
case and $147,000 for a large diversion case just for the primary investigators; adjudication 
costs and support staff are additional.  It is reasonable to assume that State and local law 
enforcement agencies are spending similar sums per case.  Some cases involve multiple 
jurisdictions, all of which bear costs for collecting data and deposing witnesses.  The rule as 
proposed could reduce the number of cases and, therefore, reduce the costs to governments at 
all levels.  A reduction in forgeries would also benefit practitioners who would be less likely 
to be at risk of being accused of diverting controlled substances and of then having to prove 
that they were not responsible.

 6.4 CONCLUSION 
 
Electronic prescriptions for controlled substances would produce cost savings that may be 
well in excess of the costs of the rule for three of the four options considered.  If the rule 
reduces diversion, it may also produce benefits in terms of reduced numbers of deaths and 
medical costs that far exceed the cost of the rule.  The rule would also protect practitioners 
from misuse of their DEA registrations and reduce the costs to law enforcement.  In contrast, 
a less secure electronic prescription system could greatly increase diversion, the deaths and 
medical costs associated with drug misuse, and the number of diversion cases.  A less secure 
system would dramatically increase investigation costs because every provider and 
intermediary involved in a transaction would have to provide testimony to attempt to 
demonstrate that a prescription was not altered during transmission.  The costs of such 
testimony would fall on law enforcement, service providers, and intermediaries.  Finally, a 
less secure system would expose practitioners to the risk of identity theft, with the 
considerable costs associated with resolving those problems.

 CHAPTER 7:  CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
 
This chapter discusses the limitations of the analysis and presents the overall conclusions.   
7.1 UNCERTAINTIES 
 
Any economic analysis involves some level of uncertainty about elements of the analysis.  
This is particularly true for this analysis, which must estimate costs for implementation of a 
new technology and project voluntary adoption rates.  This section discusses the elements 
that have the greatest level of uncertainty associated with them. 
7.1.1 RATES OF ADOPTION 
 
In 2004, the President called for a majority of Americans to have interoperable electronic 
health records within 10 years.46  This analysis does not project adoption of electronic 
prescribing to be that rapid in part because recent studies indicate that little progress has been 
made in health IT adoption outside of very large medical practices and systems.  A recent 
report from the California HealthCare Foundation stated that “while larger physician groups 
are increasingly using health IT, those who practice alone or in small groups are no closer to 
using health IT now than they were three years ago.”  The report noted that even when 
practices install EMR systems, they do not necessarily use them.47
 
The barriers to adoption are the high cost of the systems, the disruption that implementation 
creates in a practice, and uncertainty about the systems themselves.48  As discussed in 
Chapter 2, the pattern with software systems is that a large number of firms enter a market, 
but the vast majority of them fail, leaving a very few dominant providers.49  The health IT 
market is still in the early phases of this process.  DEA has no basis for estimating when 
dominant players will emerge.  The 15-year implementation period projected may be too 
conservative or too optimistic. 
7.1.2 COSTS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
The time for reprogramming existing systems is estimated to be between 500 hours and 
2,000 hours.  DEA based the upper estimate on information provided by the industry for 
DEA’s rulemaking regarding electronic orders for controlled substances.  The actual cost to 
existing service providers is likely to vary widely.  Some providers may meet all or virtually 
all of the requirements and need little reprogramming.  Many of the requirements are

 standard practice for software (e.g., access controls, automatic time outs) and should need 
minimal adjustments.  Most electronic prescribing systems appear to present the data DEA 
would require on prescriptions.  Any software firm that uses the Internet for any transaction 
will have digital signature capability.  EMR systems must support two-factor authentication 
and control access to gain CCHIT certification.  Nonetheless, DEA expects that for some 
existing providers, the requirements may take more than the estimated time. 
 
Another uncertainty on provider costs relates to the third-party audit and security provisions 
that are needed to be judged acceptable under the SysTrust, WebTrust, or SAS 70 audit 
protocols.  DEA did not assign a cost to actions that might be needed to meet the security 
standards because it has no basis for determining what may be needed by what fraction of the 
providers.  To compensate for this, DEA used a high estimate for the cost of the audit itself.  
These audits range in cost from $15,000 to $250,000 depending on the complexity of the 
firm and the IT systems.  DEA is requiring that the audit focus on only 2 of the 5 elements 
usually covered by the audit, hence the upper bound might be estimated to be $100,000 for 
the initial audit and less than that for subsequent years even for a large firm.  Most of the 
firms marketing these systems are not large, so even lower costs might be appropriate.  To 
deal with the uncertainty of the potential costs of additional security steps, DEA used an 
estimate of $125,000 for the first year and $100,000 for later years.  DEA notes that many 
firms may decide to obtain a full audit, covering all elements, but the added costs would not 
accrue to this rule. 
 
A final uncertainty of system provider costs relates to the proposed requirement for a back-up 
system for pharmacy records that would have to be at a separate location.  Some pharmacy 
service providers already provide this, but it is possible that not all do.  Nonetheless, DEA 
considers that the requirement may be standard business practice simply because the loss of 
the business records could have serious consequences unrelated to any DEA concerns. 
7.2 COSTS AND BENEFITS 
 
The costs of three of the four options considered ($19 million to $38 million annualized over 
15 years at 7 percent) are far lower than the potential cost savings even if all of those savings 
are not realized.  For the Base Case, about two thirds of the costs are attributed to a single 
requirement – that the practitioner review a log of controlled substance prescriptions once a 
month.  The cost of this proposed requirement is so great because, although the time required 
is low, the cost of a practitioner’s time and the number of practitioners are high.  The cost of 
identity proofing in Options 1 and 2 is higher, because the cost of practitioner travel time.  In 
Option 2, the cost of digital certificates is high because it is an annual cost.  The costs to the 
service provider are mainly the costs of the annual third-party audit.  DEA assumes that the 
service providers will recover their costs from the practitioners or pharmacies. 
 
The cost savings that may occur could total $900 million a year although this is an upper 
bound estimate.  It is unlikely, especially in the early years, that all of public wait time 
savings will be gained.  Until pharmacies receive a substantial percentage of prescriptions 
electronically and learn to check the incoming prescription records, there may be a 
substantial lag between system receipt and pharmacist action.  There may also still be 
April 2008 54 
 callbacks although some of these could be sent electronically.  One uncertainty associated 
with callbacks is the frequency with which pharmacists will identify problems with electronic 
prescriptions.  Although the prescriptions will be legible, pharmacists may find keying errors 
(e.g., wrong drug, wrong dosage unit, wrong form, etc.) and need to contact the practitioner 
to clarify the prescriptions.  If practitioners have not checked formularies, either because they 
have turned off the function or because the particular formulary is not available to them, 
pharmacies will still need to do callbacks for formulary issues.  In addition, the ability of e-
prescribing systems to identify contraindication problems depends on the system having a 
complete record of a patient’s medications and medical problems.  Until EMR systems can 
interoperate with EMR systems at other practitioner offices to develop a complete medical 
history, the pharmacy will continue to be a principal means of identifying these issues.  
Needed contacts between a pharmacy and practitioner, whether electronic or telephone, will 
lower the cost savings for callbacks and for public wait time.    
 
The benefits of the security requirements would be a reduction in diversion of controlled 
substances that are obtained from forged, altered, or invalid prescriptions.  DEA has no basis 
for estimating the current level of diversion from these activities and, therefore, no basis for 
an estimate of a potential reduction.  The cost of misuse of prescription controlled 
substances, however, is extremely high.  Misuse of prescription controlled substances in 
2003 was involved in almost 5,000 deaths in metropolitan areas that cover 25 percent of the 
United States population.  The value of those deaths alone is above $10 billion.  These drugs 
were also involved in more than 350,000 emergency room visits in 2005, a number that was 
more than 20 percent higher than the 2004 number.  If the requirements of this rule reduce 
even 0.5 percent of these costs, the benefits will far outweigh the costs.  DEA notes that a 
system that did not have the security controls DEA is proposing could lead to an upsurge of 
deaths and illness because it would facilitate diversion rather than limit it and make it far 
more difficult for law enforcement agencies to bring cases against the criminals involved. 
7.3 SMALL ENTITY IMPACTS 
 
DEA determined that this rule would affect a substantial number of small entities because 
almost all practitioners and all independent pharmacies are small businesses.  The costs to 
these entities, however, are very low and would not impose a significant economic impact on 
them, being far below one percent of their annual revenues.  DEA also notes that the 
proposed rule is voluntary; no practitioner or pharmacy would be required to handle 
electronic prescriptions for controlled substances. 
 
The service providers are not directly regulated by DEA and would be expected to recover 
their costs from DEA registrants.  DEA nonetheless considered their costs.  Many of these 
firms are small entities and may find complying with the security requirements, particularly 
the audit, a burden.  The cost, however, is not so great that they will not be able to pass it on 
to customers.  DEA considers it unlikely that any provider would attempt to market a product 
or service that could not be used for controlled substance records and, therefore, no provider 
will be disadvantaged by complying because all providers will incur costs and recover them 
from customers.  The situation may be similar to certification of EMRs by CCHIT.  Some 
were concerned that the standards would create barriers, but most of the companies certified 
April 2008 55 
 have been small.  The chairman of CCHIT, Mark Leavitt stated that the data on the revenues 
of firms that gained certification “laid to rest this concern that it was going to squeeze out 
small vendors.  It actually seems to have done the opposite.  It’s created a level playing 
field.”50

Fringe Benefits and Overhead 
 
Fringe benefits for health workers (except hospitals): 38.0 percent of wages 
Fringe benefits for hospital staff: 44.0 percent of wages 
Fringe benefits for service provider staff: 38.0 percent of wages 
Fringe benefits for computer programmers and pharmacy staff: 40.0 percent of wages

Overhead for all offices in study: 49.0 percent

April 2008 59 
 The overhead is applied as a multiplier to wages plus fringes.  Therefore, the multiplier to 
convert hourly wages to fully loaded hourly cost is: 
Health workers (except hospitals) and provider staff—1.38 x 1.49 = 2.06 
Hospital staff—1.44 x 1.49 = 2.15 
Computer programmers and pharmacy staff—1.40 x 1.49 = 2.09. 
 
Thus, fully loaded hourly costs are: 
                               
Physicians 2.06 x 130.41 = $269.00 
Dentists 2.06 x 103.78 = $214.07 
Mid-level practitioners 2.06 x 37.30 = $76.94 
Medical secretaries 2.06 x 14.70 = $30.33 
Hospital HR staff 2.15 x 16.56 = $35.55 
Pharmacy technicians 2.09 x 12.60 = $26.23 
Service provider representatives 2.06 x 40.70 = $83.80 
Service provider clerks 2.06 x 16.46 = $33.89 
Computer programmers  2.09 x 35.19 = $73.24 
 
To obtain hourly cost for all practitioners and for all dentists and physicians together, average 
costs were weighted by each group’s percentage share of the total.  A separate wage rate was 
calculated for physicians and dentists because turnover rates for these practitioners are 
assumed to be different from turnover rates for mid-level practitioners and are, therefore, 
costed separately. 
 
 % all practitioners
 
% all MDs and dentists  
Physicians 54.0 65.0 
Dentists 30.0 35.0 
Mid-levels 16.0  
 
Weighted growth rate for practitioners’ offices was based on the relative population shares of 
physicians and dentists in the affected universe as shown above.
