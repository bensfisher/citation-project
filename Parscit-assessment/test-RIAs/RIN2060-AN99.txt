SECTION 1  
INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing amendments to the 
national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for mercury emissions from 
mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. On June 11, 2008, EPA proposed NESHAP amendments in 
response to a petition for reconsideration filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council 
(NRDC); this action supplements the June 11, 2008, proposal. The proposed rule would amend 
the NESHAP to prohibit emissions of mercury from the mercury cell process within 2 years from 
promulgation of the final rule and cease operation of mercury recovery units 3 years from 
promulgation of the final rule.  
In 2003, when the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) was promulgated, 
there were 12 mercury cell plants. EPA believes that by 2010 there will only be four plants still 
using the mercury cell process. The four plants using the mercury cell process are currently 
owned by three ultimate parent companies: 
 ASHTA Chemicals, Inc.: one plant (Ohio) 
 Olin Corporation: two plants (Georgia and Tennessee) 
 PPG Industries, Inc.: one plant (West Virginia) 
ASHTA Chemicals is a small company with approximately 100 employees. Olin 
Corporation operates 10 North American chlor-alkali plants; its other line of business is 
Winchester Ammunition. Currently, Olin employs over 3,600 people within both business 
segments. PPG’s commodity chemicals segment operates two chlor-alkali plants but operates 
over 100 coatings and glass manufacturing facilities and employees over 40,000 people 
company-wide. 
As part of the regulatory process of preparing these amendments, EPA is required to 
develop a regulatory impact analysis (RIA). This report documents the RIA methods and results.  
1.1 Executive Summary 
The key results of the RIA are as follows: 
Engineering Cost Analysis: For Option 1 (Non-mercury Technology Option), the 
engineering cost analysis estimates the total capital costs of conversion to be just 
under $300 million, which results in annual costs of $28 million per year annualized 
over 20 years. Individual plant-level annualized capital conversion cost estimates 
 1-2 
range from $3–15 million per year. All estimates are in 2007$. The annual cost to 
store mercury is approximately $250,000 per year. The individual plant-level annual 
energy savings due to conversion may range from $1 million to $14 million per year 
depending on the energy consumption reduction level assumed. The total annual cost 
of conversion for all four facilities, considering the associated savings, is around $13 
million per year. For Option 2 (Enhanced Work Practice Standards Option) the 
capital cost is $120 thousand and the annual costs are $25 thousand.  Because of the 
small magnitude of Option 2 compared to Option 1, the market analysis only 
addresses Option 1. 
 Plant Closure: EPA does not have sufficient data to predict whether individual 
companies would choose to convert or close directly affected plants. In some 
cases, if a plant were to close, the closure may affect other closely related 
manufacturing operations. For example, ASHTA uses potassium hydroxide made 
from the mercury cell process to make potassium carbonate. If the ASHTA plant 
were to choose not to convert and close the mercury cell process, it is unclear 
whether existing technology and economics would allow the company to consider 
an alternative source of potassium hydroxide to continue making potassium 
carbonate. The economics of making potassium carbonate could influence 
ASHTA’s decision on how to respond to this rulemaking. 
 Local Job Effects: Because EPA is unable to estimate plant closures, job losses 
associated with any closures are not estimated nor are any changes in employment 
associated with conversion. 
 Market Analysis: Of the three major chlor-alkali products, the market for 
potassium hydroxide is the most highly concentrated. As of 2005, there were only 
four producers of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in the United States and 
approximately 50% is produced using mercury cells. As a result, closure of one or 
more mercury cell plants could raise concerns about competitiveness and 
subsequent pricing behavior in the potassium hydroxide market. In highly 
concentrated markets, non-mercury cell producers could have more scope to 
influence market prices above competitive levels by altering production decisions. 
EPA’s review of publicly available sources also suggests that closures would have 
similar market concentration consequences for a downstream commodity: 
potassium carbonate. Competitive issues have also been raised in other regulatory 
contexts; the Federal Trade Commission set conditions on a proposed asset 
purchase that reduced the number of competitors in the potassium hydroxide and 
potassium carbonate markets.  
 Small Business Analysis: EPA performed an impact analysis that compares 
annual conversion costs to sales. For Option 1 (Non-mercury Technology 
Option),  EPA estimates that the one small entity’s cost-to-sales ratio (CSR) 
would range from 1 to 2%, which suggests a significant economic impact. The 
other three plants are owned by large ultimate parent companies with significant 
company-wide sales. As a result, the CSRs for the large ultimate parent 
companies are below 1%. In contrast, when plant-only sales are considered, the 
 1-3 
CSRs for plants owned by large ultimate parent companies range from 4 to 10%. 
EPA also considered industry profitability effects by comparing annual 
conversion costs to reported industry margins for a representative electrochemical 
unit (ECU). The analysis confirms the results of the sales tests; plant conversion 
costs will likely have an economically significant effect. In a typical year, 
conversion costs could reduce the margins by 10 to 20%. However, as explained 
in section 3, we do not consider this to be a significant impact on a substantial 
number of small businesses. For Option 2 (Enhanced Work Practice Standards 
Option) CSR for the only plant estimated to incur costs is less than 0.1 % and is 
not a significant economic impact. 
 Benefits Analysis: In the year of full implementation (2013), EPA estimates the 
monetized energy co- benefits of Option 1 are $22 million to $43 million and $21 
million to $40 million, at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively. All estimates 
are in 2007$ for the year 2013. Using alternate relationships between PM2.5 and 
premature mortality supplied by experts, higher and lower benefits estimates are 
plausible, but most of the expert-based estimates fall between these estimates. 
There are no emission reductions for Option 2.   
 Net Benefits: The net benefits for Option 1 are $9 million to $30 million and $8 
million to $27 million, at 3% and 7% discount rates, respectively (Table 1-1). The 
net benefits for Option 2 are $-25,000.  All estimates are in 2007$ for the year 
2013.

a All estimates are for the implementation year (2013), and are rounded to two significant figures.  
b The total monetized co-benefits reflect the human health co-benefits associated with reducing exposure to PM2.5. It 
is important to note that the monetized co-benefits include many but not all health effects associated with PM2.5 
exposure. It is important to note that the monetized benefits include many but not all health effects associated with 
PM2.5 exposure. Benefits are shown as a range from Pope et al. (2002) to Laden et al. (2006). These models 
assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in causing premature 
mortality because there is no clear scientific evidence that would support the development of differential effects 
estimates by particle type. CO2-related benefits were calculated using the social cost of carbon (SCC), which is 
discussed in Section 5. The net present value of reduced CO2 emissions is calculated differently than other 
benefits.  The same discount rate used to discount the value of damages from future emissions (SCC at 5, 3, 2.5 
percent) is used to calculate net present value of SCC for internal consistency.  This table shows monetized CO2 
co-benefits at discount rates of 3 and 7 percent that were calculated using the global average SCC estimate at a 
3% discount rate because the interagency workgroup on this topic deemed this marginal value to be the central 
value.  In Section 5, we also provide the monetized CO2 co-benefits using discount rates of 5 percent (average), 
2.5 percent (average), and 3 percent (95th percentile). 
c The annual compliances costs serve as a proxy for the annual social costs of this rule. The compliance cost of a 
regulation is generally a slight overestimate of social cost for competitive markets. The size of the overestimate is 
roughly one half the price change times the quantity change. The markets for chlorine and sodium hydroxide are 
expected to be competitive with the market share provided by the affected facilities quite small. However, the 
market share for potassium hydroxide is large and the market may not be competitive. In this case, social cost 
might be larger than compliance cost. Because insufficient data was available to estimate price and quantity 
changes the compliance cost was used as a rough estimate of the social cost. 
1.2 Organization of this Report 
The remainder of this report supports and details the methodology and the results of the 
RIA: 
 Section 2 presents a profile of the affected industry and focuses on plants affected 
by the proposed rule. Although extensive individual plant information would help 
 1-5 
assess the economic impacts of the rule, in most cases, detailed information is not 
publicly available. As a result, we frequently rely on parent company information 
provided in company annual reports (e.g., form 10-K), local press and industry 
trade publications, and company Web sites.  
 Section 3 describes the engineering cost analysis. 
 Section 4 describes the economic impact analysis and small business impact 
analysis. 
 Section 5 presents the benefits estimates.

SECTION 2  
INDUSTRY PROFILE  
There are four mercury cell chlor-alkali plants currently operating in the United States in 
2010 that have the combined capacities to produce approximately 500,000 tons of chlorine per 
year. These plants are Olin Corporation in Augusta, Georgia (Olin GA); Olin Corporation in 
Charleston, Tennessee (Olin TN); PPG Industries in New Martinsville, West Virginia (PPG); and 
ASHTA Chemicals in Ashtabula, Ohio (ASHTA).  
EPA has developed an industry profile to provide the reader a general understanding of 
the technical and economic aspects of the industry. We outline processes and costs of getting 
chlorine products to market; identify key uses, consumers, and market characteristics; and 
provide economic data for the plants and owning companies affected by the proposed rule. 
Although we prefer to have extensive individual plant information, in most cases this 
information is not publicly available. As a result, we frequently rely on parent company 
information provided in company annual reports (e.g., form 10-K), local press and industry trade 
publications, and company websites. 
2.1 Supply Side 
2.1.1 Chlorine Production Process 
Although chlorine can be generated as a by-product in a variety of chemical reactions, 
brine electrolysis accounts for 95% of total world chlorine production (World Chlorine Council, 
2002). Through a chemical reaction catalyzed by an electric current in a series of electrolytic 
cells, a salt-based solution containing either sodium or potassium chloride yields elemental 
chlorine gas, a caustic solution, and hydrogen gas in fixed proportions (“Special Focus on 
Chlorine,” 2007). The electrolysis occurs when electric current flows between the negatively 
charged cathodes and the anodes, which are the positive electrodes from which the chlorine is 
collected (World Chlorine Council, 2002). 
Three types of electrolytic cells can host this reaction: the diaphragm cell, the membrane 
cell, or the mercury cell. Although the three cell types share the basic chemical production 
formula, they are differentiated by the way in which the chlorine is kept separate from the co-
products generated in the cathode in the chemical process (“Special Focus on Chlorine,” 2007). 
The predominant manufacturing process in North America involves diaphragm cell technology, 
which is characterized by the asbestos-based diaphragm structure that keeps the cathodes 
separate from the anodes. The membrane cell is structurally similar, though it uses an ion-
 2-2 
exchange membrane to separate the anodes and chlorine gas from the caustic product. Mercury 
cell technology uses two distinct cells and functions through a sodium-mercury stream that forms 
an amalgam and serves as the cathode (“Special Focus on Chlorine,” 2007). 
Of the three electrolytic processes, the diaphragm and membrane processes are the most 
similar (Table 2-1). Both share the advantage of lower electricity consumption, but the unique 
ion-exchange structure enables membrane cells to produce a purer caustic product than the 
asbestos-based diaphragm. Another disadvantage of the diaphragm cell is the caustic limitations; 
although mercury and membrane cells can use sodium or potassium chloride for brine solution, 
diaphragm cells require sodium chloride. Mercury cells produce a high-quality caustic solution 
and chlorine gas, but emit harmful mercury pollutants into the environment. New plant 
construction has favored membrane cell construction because of low capital investment and 
operating costs relative to diaphragm and mercury processes (“Special Focus on Chlorine,” 
2007).

2.1.2 Product Types 
2.1.2.1 Chlorine 
Chlorine takes form in a greenish-yellow poisonous gas at STP. It has a pungent odor and 
is 2.48 times denser than air. When liquefied, it becomes a yellow mobile fluid with low 
electrical conductivity. As a solid, chlorine retains the yellow color in the form of rhombic 
crystals. Chlorine is soluble in cold water and in salt solutions, although the solubility decreases 
with salt strength and temperature. Chlorine is stored and transported as a liquefied gas (“Special 
Focus on Chlorine,” 2007). 
2.1.2.2 Caustic Products: Sodium Hydroxide and Potassium Hydroxide 
Sodium hydroxide, commonly referred to as caustic soda, is produced as a co-product 
with chlorine and usually sold in the form of a 50% solution. All three cell types can use sodium 
chloride brine in the electrolysis process to derive sodium hydroxide, but the variations between 
the cell structures require different degrees of evaporation and purification to reach the 50% 
concentration. Only mercury cells generate the 50% liquid caustic solution directly; diaphragm 
cells yield a solution of 12% that is processed through filters and evaporators to reach the 
acceptable grade, while membrane cells produce a 30% liquid that is evaporated to the 50% level 
(Occidental Chemical Corporation, 2008b). 
While most chlor-alkali production involves sodium chloride brine, potassium hydroxide 
or caustic potash is the caustic solution produced when potassium chloride is used as a feedstock 
in the brine electrolysis process (Sim, 2005). Membrane and mercury cell electrolysis can 
produce a caustic potash solution that is evaporated to 45% or 50% concentration for sale. The 
solution can also be concentrated to dry form and sold as flakes or crystals (Occidental Chemical 
Corporation, 2008a). 
2.1.3 Materials and Costs of Production 
Energy, salt brine, and raw materials represent the majority of the production costs in the 
chlor-alkali industry. The recent U.S. Census Bureau’s 2007 Economic Census provides 
industry-level expenditures on production inputs for North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) code 325181 (Alkalis and Chlorine Manufacturers). The cost of materials 
(including electricity and purchased fuels) was 62.7% of the total production costs and nearly 
half of the industry’s total value of shipments. Electricity and fuels made up over 31% of total 
production costs. Labor expenses account for around 12.5% of the total reported costs in the 
industry.  
 2-4 
Although the census data provide insight into the chlor-alkali industry cost structure on 
the aggregate level, there is variation between companies in the industry because of size, 
structure, and technology. Olin Corporation, (2008) operates a number of chlor-alkali facilities 
across the country and cites electricity and salt as the largest share of raw material expenditures, 
which represent 55% of total production costs for the company. Other principle materials include 
potassium chloride, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen (Olin Corporation, 2008).  
Although energy costs are important for all producers, each cell type requires a different 
combination of energy inputs. For example, membrane cell technology uses 25% less electricity 
than mercury cells but requires steam to concentrate the caustic product that mercury cells do not 
(“Special Focus on Chlorine,” 2007). Table 2-2 illustrates the approximate energy requirements 
of the different cell types as well as the average electricity prices for the states in which the 
relevant plants are located.

Individual facility capital costs are also contingent on the specific requirements of the 
electrolytic cells used in the production process. For example, the complex mercury cell has a 
higher current density than the diaphragm or membrane and demands a relatively higher capital 
investment. The variations in purification requirements impose the highest brine costs for 
membrane cell plants, whereas the relatively simple brine system accounts for only 3 to 4% of a 
diaphragm cell facility’s capital costs (“Special Focus on Chlorine,” 2007). A mid-sized mercury 
 2-5 
cell plant not only bears the additional costs of the mercury itself, but also spends 10 to 15% of 
the total capital investment on equipment to prevent the hazardous emissions and to remove the 
mercury from the finished products (“Special Focus on Chlorine,” 2007). 
2.1.4 Chlor-alkali Transportation 
A critical element in any production industry is the successful transfer of final products 
from the facility to the client. However, the hazardous nature of chemical products requires 
chlor-alkali companies to devote extra resources to developing a geographic network of facilities 
and shipping points that integrates both cost considerations and safety concerns. Industry experts 
are acutely aware of the risks associated with chemical production and strive to maintain security 
of their products, the safety of their employees and consumers, and the well-being of local 
communities.  
In addition to complying with carefully developed industry standards and stewardship 
practices, chlor-alkali facilities are also subject to federal regulations regarding the proper 
handling of dangerous chemicals. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) regulates the transportation of chlorine and 
its derivatives under the Hazardous Material Regulations (49 CFR 171-180) (U.S. Department of 
Transportation, 2009a and 2009b). The PHMSA and other federal regulatory agencies control the 
movement of hazardous materials by all applicable modes of transportation. Chlorine and its 
derivatives are shipped via rail, highway, water vessel, and pipeline. According to the American 
Chemistry Council, rail hosts the majority of bulk chlorine shipments in the United States (30,000 
tank car/yr) and is the safest mode of chlorine transportation (American Chemistry Council, 
2009). Although accidents are rare, a 2005 Norfolk Southern freight train collision in South 
Carolina that killed or injured over 200 people illustrates real risks that chlorine transportation 
poses to civilians and communities (Environmental News Service, 2005). Even though industry 
experts work in conjunction with transportation authorities to ensure that procedures and policies 
are carefully executed, the risk of an accident can never be completely eliminated.  
One way to mitigate the risk of an accident is to minimize the distance from the producer 
to the end-user, which effectively curtails the potential for unexpected events or hazardous leaks 
during transit. Cutting down on travel distance and time is not only cost-effective for producers, 
but it also prevents unnecessary exposure of civilian communities to the dangers associated with 
a collision. Familiarity with travel routes and transportation contractors may also aid chlorine 
producers in reducing the potential for unforeseen circumstances that could threaten the security 
of the cargo. 
 2-6 
In light of these issues, companies in the chlor-alkali industry have selected existing 
facility locations based on the financial, logistic, and safety concerns involved with shipping 
their products. Plants, warehouses, and distribution centers are deliberately constructed in 
specific locations to serve customers safely and efficiently. ASHTA’s production facility is 
located adjacent to the titanium dioxide plant to which it sells 100% of its chlorine (U.S. House 
of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Energy, 2009). The company also has 
warehouses, liquid distribution points, and sales headquarters placed strategically across the 
United States to cater to nationwide potassium hydroxide demand (ASHTA, 2009a). PPG 
pioneered 1,100-ton capacity barges as a safe mode of chlorine transport from the Natrium plant, 
which is ideally situated on the Ohio River easily accessible by the CSX rail line (PPG, 2009a). 
Olin Corporation’s Charleston plant produces potassium hydroxide and uses rail, barge and 
trucks to ship the product to customers and the terminal facility located in nearby Chattanooga 
(Olin Corporation, 2009c).  
2.2 The Demand Side 
A variety of applications use chlor-alkali products to make other goods. As a result, the 
demand for chlor-alkali products indirectly depends on conditions in downstream end-use 
markets. The organic chemicals industry uses chlorine to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and 
the construction industry subsequently uses PVC materials. The pulp and paper industry uses 
caustic soda during manufacturing processes that create paper and other products. Electronic 
products (e.g., televisions and computer monitors) requiring glass cathode ray tubes use 
potassium carbonate made from caustic potash. As a result of these links, growth or downturns in 
end-use markets ultimately influence the demand for chlor-alkali products. 
2.2.1 Who Uses Chlorine, Caustic Soda, and Caustic Potash? 
Plant-specific information regarding end-users and other within/between plant 
relationships is not generally available or is limited. According to company annual reports (Olin 
Corporation, 2009a), industry-wide data show that the organic chemical industry uses over 60% 
of chlorine (Figure 2-1). Vinyl chemical producers are industrial consumers (37%), and other 
organic chemical producers use an additional 28%. For caustic soda (Figure 2-2), organic 
chemicals, pulp and paper, and inorganic chemicals are significant end users; each industry 
accounts for more than 20% of caustic soda demand. For caustic potash (Figure 2-3), potassium 
carbonate (28%), other potassium chemicals (15%), and potassium phosphates (10%) are the 
most significant end uses (The Innovation Group [TIG], 2009). The remaining applications are 
diverse and all account for less than 10% of the market.

Olin Corporation (2008) also reports details regarding company-specific end uses and 
customers for their chlor-alkali products in the company’s annual reports (Table 2-3). This 
information applies to all 10 North American chlor-alkali plants and may not necessarily be 
representative of the end-users associated with the mercury cell plant. However, it is the best 
publicly available information EPA was able to identify. Olin sells a majority of its chlor-alkali 
products to third parties; in 2008, no single customer bought more than 8% of total sales (Olin 
Corporation, 2008). Chlorine is also sold to a relatively small number of industrial customers; In 
contrast, caustic soda is sold to a large number of users or distributors (Olin Corporation, 2008).  
Trade publications report that ASHTA supplies chlorine to a nearby titanium dioxide 
facility originally owned by Lyondell Chemicals (Sim, 1995); the plant is now owned by 
Cristal’s Millennium Inorganic Chemicals business and continues to produce titanium dioxide 
(Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, 2009). ASHTA reports that all of its chlorine is sold to “a 
company located adjacent to ASHTA’s facility” (U.S. House of Representatives Committee on 
Commerce and Energy, 2009). Some of ASHTA’s other alkali products are used within the

2.2.2 What Factors Influence Demand? 
The chlor-alkali industry is considered a procyclical industry where demand for product 
depends on trends in overall economic activity. For example, Olin Corporation (2008) notes: 
The business of most of our customers, particularly our vinyl, urethanes, and pulp 
and paper customers are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically 
experienced periodic downturns. These economic and industry downturns have 
been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity 
and, in some cases, lower average selling prices. Therefore, any significant 
downturn in our customers’ businesses or in global economic conditions could 
 2-10 
result in a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our 
results of operations or financial condition. (p. 8) 
Recent research has also suggested that environmental regulations affecting chlorine end-
use markets have reduced the demand for chlorine and help explain the exit of selected chlorine 
plants (Snyder, Miller, and Stavins, 2003). Chlorine plants that were co-located with pulp and 
paper mills and plants affected by the Montreal Protocol were more likely to shutdown (11 to 
15% higher than the average chlorine plant) (Snyder, Miller, and Stavins, 2003). 
In addition to overall demand conditions, selected chlor-alkali product markets are very 
sensitive to price changes of close substitute products. For example, when the price of caustic 
soda rises, soda ash can be substituted for caustic soda in certain uses (e.g., pulp and paper, water 
treatment, and certain chemical sectors) (U.S. Geological Survey [USGS], 2009). 
2.3 Market Characteristics 
A review and description of market characteristics (i.e., geography, product 
differentiation, entry barriers, and degree of concentration) can enhance our understanding of 
how chlor-alkali markets operate. These characteristics provide indicators of a firm’s ability to 
influence market prices by varying the quantity of product it sells. For example, in markets with 
large numbers of sellers and identical products, firms are unlikely to be able to influence market 
prices via their production decisions (i.e., they are “price takers”). However, in markets with few 
firms, significant barriers to entry (e.g., licenses, legal restrictions, or high fixed costs), or 
products that are similar but can be differentiated, a firm may have some degree of market power 
(i.e., set or significantly influence market prices). 
2.3.1 Geography 
Most chlorine is not sold on the market and is consumed internally by the manufacturer. 
However, marketed chlorine and potassium hydroxide compete in a North American market; 
imports are limited by transportation costs and customer requirements for service and product 
availability (Olin Corporation, 2008; U.S. Federal Trade Commission [FTC], 2005). In contrast, 
caustic soda producers sell their product in a worldwide market (Olin Corporation, 2008). 
2.3.2 Product Differentiation 
Product differentiation can occur both from differences in product attributes and quality 
and from brand name recognition of products. For a given end use, industrial consumers are 
likely to view chlor-alkali products produced by different firms as very good substitutes. As a 
result, the products are likely to be sold primarily on a price basis (Olin Corporation, 2008). In 
 2-11 
addition, a close substitute for caustic soda exists (soda ash) and limits the ability of caustic soda 
producers to significantly influence caustic soda prices by varying the quantities produced 
(USGS, 2009).  
2.3.3 Entry 
Short-term entry into the chlor-alkali market is difficult because new plants require 
significant capital expenditures and take time to build. For example, the FTC concluded that new 
entry in the potassium hydroxide market would not be “timely, likely, or sufficient” in response 
to significant price increases (FTC, 2005, p. 5). Historically, imports have only played a major 
competitive role in the caustic soda markets only.  
2.3.4 Concentration 
Of the three chlor-alkali products, the market for potassium hydroxide is the most highly 
concentrated. As of 2005, there were only four producers of potassium hydroxide in the United 
States (FTC, 2005b). Approximately 50% is produced using mercury cells; ASHTA Chemicals 
reports a market share of approximately 15% (U.S. House of Representatives Committee on 
Commerce and Energy, 2009). The FTC (2005a, b) has also assessed competitive effects of 
proposed company acquisitions in this sector in some detail. Given these characteristics and 
conclusions of the FTC study, significant changes in production levels at a single company using 
mercury cells are likely to influence market prices, particularly over short periods. 
2.4 Overview of Businesses Affected by the Rule 
The proposed rule affects four mercury cell plants operating in the United States. We 
provide basic economic statistics for each plant and the ultimate parent companies that own each 
plant. These data are subsequently used for the economic impact analysis described in Section 3.  
2.4.1 Mercury Cell Plants 
The four mercury cell plants are located in four different states: Georgia, Ohio, 
Tennessee, and West Virginia. Annual plant sales ranges were estimated using economic data 
from the 2002 Economic Census (Table 2-4) and employment data. Given the uncertainties with 
sales data, we report a low and high range estimate for each plant. Lower-bound sales were 
obtained by multiplying the average value of shipments per employee by the number of 
employees. The upper-bound sales represent the average establishment value of shipments for 
the appropriate establishment size. In cases where census data were not disclosed, we used the 
industry average. As shown, annual plant sales estimates range from $30 to $130 million 
(Table 2-5).

2.4.2 Ultimate Parent Companies 
EPA has reviewed industry information and publicly available sales and employment 
databases to identify the chain of ownership by accounting for subsidiaries, divisions, and joint 
ventures to appropriately group companies by size. Table 2-6 provides sales and employment 
data for three ultimate parent companies operating mercury plants. EPA classified each parent 
company as a small or large entity using Small Business Administration (SBA) general size 
standard definitions for NAICS codes. These size standards are presented either by number of 
employees or by annual receipt levels, depending on the NAICS code. The chlor-alkali 
companies are covered by NAICS code 325181 and are categorized as small if the total number 
of employees at the ultimate parent company is fewer than 500; otherwise, the ultimate parent 
company is classified as large. As shown in Table 2-6 ASHTA Inc. is considered a small 
business.

2.4.2.1 Company Profitability Measures 
Company profitability trends significantly influence the ability and desire to take on 
large-scale capital projects. Although data on profits for individual companies are limited, 
historical government statistics about industry groups and publicly traded companies provide 
accounting measures of profit in annual reports. In Figure 2-4, we present information from the 
U.S. Census Quarterly Manufacturing Reports about the Basic Chemicals, Resins, and Synthetics 
(NAICS 3251 and 3252) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000–2006). This is the finest level of detail 
reported by the Census and includes other chemical industries in addition to the chlor-alkali 
industry. As shown, there is substantial variation in the profitability rates for the industry; before-
tax profits as a percentage of net sales range from 1 to 10% during this period, with an average of 
5% and a standard deviation of 3%. 
 2-14

Corporations, 1st Quarter reports. http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/qfr-mm.html. Accessed July 2009. 
Census data also show that smaller companies (defined by Census as companies with less 
the $25 million in assets) have profit rates that are smaller than industry averages. For example, 
in a representative year during this period (2000), before-tax profits as a percentage of net sales 
for small companies were less than 1% compared to approximately 6% for the industry as a 
whole. 
To assess how representative the census data were for individual companies, EPA 
examined annual reports for Olin Corporation and PPG Industries and found before-tax profit 
rates were comparable with quarterly financial report (QFR) 2000 industry averages. Olin 
reported a rate of approximately 8% and PPG reported a rate of 11% (Olin Corporation, 2001; 
PPG, 2001). These values are based on income statements and include all operations in addition 
to the chlor-alkali segment. Olin reported similar profit rates for its chlor-alkali segment (~7%), 
but PPG did not report separate profitability information for their chemical commodity segment.

3.1 Capital Costs 
 
Initially, to determine capital costs of conversion to non-mercury technology, EPA 
collected capital cost data for mercury cell conversion projects that occurred between 1992 and 
2008 from the search of the resources listed above. In their September 15, 2009 memorandum, 
Oceana pointed out that several of the capital cost data points were not appropriate because 
either the costs were from unsubstantiated estimates or they were developed from conversions 
that were done so long ago that they did not apply to membrane cell technologies currently being 
used.  
Initially, Oceana identified seven capital cost data points for conversion to non-mercury 
technology that were derived from estimates rather than actual conversions. These were: 
 One 1997 estimate published by a HoltraChem facility where the conversion did 
not in actuality occur; 
 One 1988 estimate for a facility in the U.S. that could not be identified; 
 One 1992 estimate for a “model plant” representing a mid-range facility size, with 
no documentation included; and  
 Four European estimates for conversions to non-mercury technology, which did 
not include information on plant production capacities.  
In addition, Oceana stated that conversion project costs prior to 1995 are not applicable to 
current-day conversion costs. According to Oceana, newer membrane-cell technology uses

provided comments on EPA’s analyses of the costs and other impacts of converting mercury cell chlor-alkali 
plants to membrane cells on multiple occasions, along with providing substantial data and analyses to support 
their comments.

bipolar electrolyzers, which were not commercially available until around 1997. The conversions 
prior to 1995 would have used the older monopolar electrolyzers. Therefore, we agree with 
Oceana’s position that for this analysis it is not appropriate to include the data points derived 
from conversions that took place prior to 1995; thus these data points were not used in our 
current analysis. 
We developed capital cost factors for conversion to membrane cell technology in units of 
dollars per ton ($/ton) of chlorine (Cl2) production using data from conversions anywhere in the 
world that took place after 1995, excluding the cost data described above. These costs and cost 
factors are shown in Table 3-1. The cost factors ranged from $267 to $941/ton Cl2 produced and 
averaged $535/ton Cl2. In addition, Table 3-1 shows the average of the cost factors from only the 
most recent US conversions (since 2000), which is $596/ton Cl2. 
Since membrane cells are smaller than mercury cells, in some conversions the companies 
have elected to use the extra available space to install additional membrane cells, thus increasing 
the chlorine and caustic production capacity of the facility. Therefore, for some conversion 
projects included in Table 3-1, an increase in production capacity was also included. Oceana 
indicated in their comments that a conversion cost analysis should either exclude the costs 
attributed to expanding capacity or include the cost saving benefits derived from expanding 
capacity. We do not believe that it is appropriate to make an assumption about savings because 
any benefits derived from additional sales due to increased capacity assumes that product 
demand would simultaneously increase. We do not disagree that the additional incremental costs 
of the expanded capacity should be excluded. However, the available information does not 
provide a breakdown of the costs associated with conversion versus the costs associated with the 
increased capacity. Therefore, the capital costs for some conversions may include expansion 
costs. This could result in the capital costs based on these data being biased high. 
When providing comments on the June 2009 memorandum, ASHTA stated that 
differences in size, the new or expanded infrastructure required, and the end products desired 
(e.g., vapor or liquid chlorine, dilute or merchant concentration of caustic) all impact the actual 
cost of conversion. ASHTA suggested that, minimally, conversion cost estimates should take 
into account economies of scale. However, Oceana expressed concern with the use of an 
equation that relates increasing size to lower conversion costs to estimate the cost of conversion 
for the four remaining facilities, since extrapolation of the costs to very small or very large 
capacities produces illogical conclusions. But we do believe that there could be some economies 
of scale. An equation we developed using the limited data set of the recent U.S. conversions

showed a good correlation (correlation coefficient (R2),16 = 0.9981) of costs to facility 
size/capacity.17
Figure 3-1 presents these cost factors versus plant chlorine capacity for all the facilities. 
As shown in Figure 3-1, there is little correlation between cost factor and plant chlorine capacity 
(R2 = 0.0102) for all global conversions with documented data. Therefore, we agree with Oceana 
that it is most appropriate to use a single cost factor to estimate the capital costs of conversion. 
 However, when the entire data set (in Table 3-1) was plotted, a similar 
correlation was not observed.

In order to develop capital cost factors for the current four mercury cell facilities, the 
chlorine production capacities from the 1997 Directories of Chemical Producers18
Table 3-2. Estimated Capital Costs for Existing Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Facilities 
 were obtained 
and are shown in Table 3-2. The capital costs of converting to membrane cell technology for the 
four facilities in current operation were then estimated using these capacities. As shown in 
Table 3-2, capital costs were estimated using both the average capital cost factor for the entire 
data set ($535/ton Cl2) in Table 3-1, and then also using the average of only the four most recent 
U.S. conversions ($596/ton Cl2) since 2000.

Because of several known factors, including environmental regulations and process 
safety management, we do not believe the broad range of data represented by all the facilities 
shown in Table 3-1 to be as accurate as the recent conversions that have occurred since 2000 in 
the U.S. to use to estimate the potential capital costs of conversion for the four remaining U.S. 
facilities. We believe that the average cost factor from the four recent U.S. conversions results in 
the best estimate of the capital costs that would occur for all four mercury cell chlor-alkali plants 
to convert to membrane cells. The total estimated capital cost of conversion for all four facilities, 
therefore, is approximately $300 million, which is also shown in Table 3-2. 
3.2 Annual Costs 
The annual costs associated with the conversion of mercury cells to membrane cells 
include costs related to capital recovery, unused mercury storage costs, and energy costs due to 
the need for increased steam required to further concentrate caustic. However, some of these

additional annual costs will be offset by savings realized due to the elimination of mercury, e.g., 
mercury-related environmental compliance costs and the reduced energy needs for the membrane 
cell process. Each of these costs and savings are described below. 
3.2.1 Capital Recovery Cost 
Annualization of the capital costs involves establishing an annual “payment” sufficient to 
finance the investment over the expected lifetime of the equipment or loan period. This payment 
is typically referred to as the “capital recovery cost.” The three key inputs into the capital 
recovery costs are the capital costs, the interest rate, and the finance period. The estimates for 
capital costs were discussed above; the remainder of this discussion is focused on the interest 
rate and the finance period. 
As pointed out by Olin in their February 2, 2010, correspondence “access to capital and 
available interest rates are a function of many things, including the overall financial 
environment, the financial condition of the prospective borrower (including its debt load), and 
the amount and length of the loan.” In their June 25, 2009 correspondence, Olin also stated that 
“a 7 percent interest rate is simply not available to industry in this economy.” They suggested 
replacing the 7 percent rate with a 10 percent, or even a 14 percent rate. In their February 2010 
correspondence, Olin provided an example to support the use of an interest rate higher than 
7 percent. Olin reported that they sold $150 million in Senior Notes, and that these notes had an 
interest rate of 8.875 percent and a maturity date of August 2019. According to Olin, the 
effective interest rate was over 9 percent considering the costs and discount. 
The interest rate can result in significant differences in total annualized costs. For 
example, for a finance period of 15 years, the difference in capital recovery costs is 
approximately 20 percent higher for a 10 percent interest rate than for a 7 percent interest rate. 
This difference is even more profound for longer finance periods. 
EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards always provides an interest rate of 
7 percent for cost analysis. While we do not disagree with Olin’s information, we feel that it is 
important to maintain uniformity to allow decision-makers to consider consistent information 
across various regulatory decisions. Therefore, in this present analysis, an interest rate of 7 
percent was used in the development of the capital recovery cost. It should be noted that for a 
particular firm at a particular time, this interest rate of 7% might not be available because of 
either the firms financial health or temporary economic condition. In previous versions of this 
analysis, a finance period of 15 years was used. Oceana commented that this underestimates the 
useful life of the equipment and overestimates the annualized costs. Oceana suggested that a 30-
 3-8 
year finance period was more appropriate, and cited a previous analysis for the mercury cell 
industry where EPA used a 30-year period to estimate the capital recovery costs.19
To illustrate the importance of the choice of finance period, consider the fact that the 
capital recovery costs for a 30-year finance period at 7-percent interest rate would be 
approximately 30 percent lower than those for a 15 year finance period. Table 3-3 shows the 
annual capital recovery costs for both a 15-year and 30-year period, using the capital cost 
estimates based on the cost factor from the average of recent U.S. conversions shown in 
Table 3-2 of the previous section. While we recognize that a 15-year finance period may 
understate the lifetime of the membrane cell process equipment, we believe that the use of a 30-
year period will bias the annualized costs unreasonably low. Therefore, we chose to base our 
capital recovery cost estimates on a 20-year finance period which is higher than our previous 
estimate of 15 percent. This results in total annualized costs for the four U.S. facilities of 
approximately $30 million/yr, which we believe represent the best estimate of the capital 
recovery costs, as shown in Table 3-3. 
 However, it is 
important to note that the use of a 30-year finance period in the analysis cited by Oceana was for 
a stationary building and not an operating industrial process. Therefore, we do not agree that this 
example establishes a precedent that is pertinent to our analysis.

3.2.2 Annual Costs Associated with Storage of Unused Mercury  
According to the Chlorine Institute, there were 1,376 tons of mercury available at the five 
mercury cell plants operating in 2008.20
Table 3-4. Estimate of Annual Mercury Storage Costs 
 These plants operated a total of 264 mercury cells, 
which equates to 5.2 tons of mercury per cell (ton Hg/cell) on the average. To estimate the 
amount of mercury available at each of the four currently operating facilities, that would need to 
be stored if they converted to membrane cells, this average factor was multiplied by the number 
of cells in each of the facilities. As shown in Table 3-4, this results in an estimated total of 1,272 
tons of mercury to be stored, ranging from 125 tons at ASHTA to over 550 tons at Olin TN.

There were two sources of information identified that provided estimates of mercury 
storage costs. EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics and the EPA Office of Solid 
Waste and Emergency Response21 has estimated future mercury storage costs at a private facility 
would be between $0.081 and $0.186 per year per pound of mercury stored, with an average of 
$0.134 per year per pound. The Defense National Stockpile Center also has presented 
information indicating that the cost associated with the federal mercury storage is $0.0561/yr/lb

Table 3-4 shows the estimated storage costs using both the average factor from EPA 
($0.134/yr/lb) and the factor from the Department of Defense ($0.0561/yr/lb). While there is a 
considerable difference in these estimates, the sources of the information are reliable. Use of 
either factor could bias the annual cost estimates high or low. Therefore, we assumed that these 
two points represent the upper and lower bounds of the storage costs, and that the midpoint of the 
range of storage costs represents the best estimate of the mercury storage costs that would be 
incurred. These midpoint costs, which are also shown in Table 3-4, total just over $240,000 per 
year for all four plants. 
The Mercury Export Ban Act (MEBA), which became public law on October 14, 2008 
(Public Law No. 110-414), is intended to reduce the availability of elemental mercury in 
domestic and international markets. MEBA prohibits the export of elemental mercury as of 
January 1, 2013, and requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to designate and operate a 
facility (or facilities) for the purpose of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury 
generated in the United States. MEBA also prohibits the transfer of elemental mercury held by 
federal agencies as of the date of enactment in order to further control the flow of elemental 
mercury in the domestic market. MEBA covers elemental mercury but not mercury compounds.  
MEBA requires DOE to publish guidance establishing procedures and standards for the 
receipt, management and long-term storage of elemental mercury by October 1, 2009. DOE 
issued an Interim Guidance document to fulfill this requirement, which is available at 
http://mercurystorageeis.com/Elementalmercurystorage%20Interim%20Guidance%20(dated%20
2009-11-13).pdf (See also Notice of Availability, November 16, 2009, 74 FR 58952). DOE must 
designate a facility or facilities for long-term management and storage of elemental mercury by 
January 1, 2010 according to MEBA. DOE has issued a Draft Long-Term Management and 
Storage of Elemental Mercury Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which analyzes a number 
of candidate facilities. The draft Mercury Storage EIS is available at 
http://www.mercurystorageeis.com/ (See also Notice of Availability, January 29, 2010, 75 FR 
4801). DOE is due to release a draft environmental impact statement (dEIS) for evaluating 
potential storage sites by December 2010.  
MEBA requires that DOE to assess and collect fees for providing management and 
storage of elemental mercury. The amount of the fees will be made publicly available by October 
1, 2012. MEBA also requires a designated facility or facilities to be operational by January 1, 
2013; the facility will be subject to RCRA Subtitle C requirements, except for the storage 
prohibition contained in § 3004(j) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. MEBA requires the storage 
facility to accept custody, for the purpose of management and storage, of elemental mercury 
 3-11 
generated within the United States and delivered to the facility, and that persons who deliver 
elemental mercury to the storage facility are indemnified against any liability related to the 
release or threatened release of mercury after delivery to the facility. MEBA also requires EPA 
or an authorized state to issue a final decision on a RCRA permit application for a DOE facility 
by January 1, 2015.  
In addition, MEBA authorizes DOE to establish terms and conditions for the long-term 
management and storage of elemental mercury. DOE has indicated that elemental mercury to be 
stored at the DOE facility or facilities must be of a purity of 99.5 percent or greater by volume 
(see DOE Interim Guidance document and Draft Mercury Storage EIS). Therefore, elemental 
mercury of lower purity would need to be further refined before it could be stored at the DOE 
facility (or facilities), but export or federal agency transfer of such mercury is still prohibited. 
MEBA does not affect RCRA or RCRA regulations except that elemental mercury stored at the 
DOE facility, or elemental mercury that is destined for the DOE facility and accumulated for 90 
days or less is not subject to the RCRA storage prohibition, 3004(j) of the Solid Waste Disposal 
Act (42 U.S.C. 6924(j)). (See MEBA Sec. 5(g)(2)). 
The elemental mercury that chlor-alkali facilities store on-site remains a commercial 
chemical product and its storage is not barred by federal environmental statutes as long as it is 
not discarded. This is the case whether the facility continues to operate a mercury cell process, 
converts to a non-mercury process or shuts down the plant. State or local restrictions may apply, 
however. After the establishment and operation of the DOE facility, mercury being stored at 
chlor-alkali plants can continue to be stored as a product. However, if storage continues over a 
long period of time, or if the supply of commodity grade mercury exceeds domestic demand, 
EPA may assess on a case-by-case basis the legitimacy of a claim that elemental mercury storage 
does not constitute discard. For a full discussion, see 
http://www.epa.gov/boston/topics/cleanup/compendium/2002-Mercury-from-the-HoltraChem-
Manufacturing-Co.pdf The EPA encourages responsible stewardship of the elemental mercury 
designated to go to a DOE facility, which could involve arranging secure temporary storage, 
such as a RCRA-permitted facility with the capacity to store mercury on a short term basis, until 
the company can send it to DOE for long-term storage.  
3.2.3 Costs Savings Associated with the Elimination of Mercury-Related Environmental 
Compliance Costs 
There are some expected costs savings related to the conversion from a mercury-
containing process to the membrane cell process due to the elimination of compliance costs 
associated with the use of mercury. These savings can be categorized into three environmental 
 3-12 
elements: air, waste, and water. Air-related environmental compliance cost savings are realized 
when the facility no longer has to comply with mercury-related air regulations, as well as labor 
due to the elimination of mercury-related air monitoring, reporting, abatement measures, and 
occupational exposure monitoring. Waste-related environmental compliance cost savings are 
realized when a facility no longer incurs costs due to recycling, retorting, transporting, storing 
and/or disposing of mercury wastes. Water-related environmental compliance cost savings are 
realized when the facility no longer is required to operate mercury wastewater treatment 
programs.  
We used information from the literature23 (with costs converted from Euros to U.S. 
dollars using the average 2004 exchange rate24 of 1.2439) and cost information presented to the 
State of Ohio by ASHTA as a part of their consent order25
18
 to estimate the cost savings. 
Information related to annual compliance costs associated with reducing mercury air emissions 
from the hydrogen and end box vent streams, presented to the Ohio EPA by ASHTA under the 
consent order, indicated that ASHTA would spend approximately $228,000 annually on air 
compliance. This value was converted to a $/ton Cl2 value based on ASHTA’s capacity of 
47,421 ton Cl2/yr,  resulting in a cost factor of $4.81/ton Cl2 capacity. Since these costs would 
no longer be incurred after conversion, this factor represents a savings. In contrast, European 
information indicates that a savings of approximately $2.20/ton Cl2 in expenditures related to air 
compliance could be realized from the elimination of mercury.23  
In addition to the air-related compliance costs described above, ASHTA presented to the 
Ohio EPA that they would be spending approximately $256,500 annually on fugitive mercury 
emission-related activities (including the implementation of leak detection and repair standards). 
Upon conversion to membrane cells, this would represent a savings. These costs and savings are 
not relevant for the other three facilities because ASHTA is the only facility that did not install a 
cell room instrumental monitoring program and, therefore, is required to perform a leak program. 
ASHTA also presented information to the Ohio EPA related to costs for their water 
treatment system. According to ASHTA, they spend approximately $98,000 annually on their 
storm water recovery system. This converts to a cost/savings factor of $2.07/ton Cl2 capacity for

elimination of water-related compliance costs due to mercury use. The European information 
indicates that a cost savings of approximately $1.92/ton Cl2 could be realized by the eliminations 
of a mercury wastewater treatment system.23 
Waste-related environmental compliance cost savings are realized by facilities no longer 
being required to recycle, retort, transport, store and/or dispose of mercury-containing wastes. 
The only information available was the European data that indicated that facilities could expect a 
cost savings of $6,470/ton waste, at an average mercury waste production rate of 4.2x10-5 ton 
waste per ton Cl2.23 This results in a waste-related cost savings of $0.27/ton Cl2 capacity for 
elimination of waste-related compliance costs due to mercury use. 
Table 3-5 presents the cost savings factors for each environmental compliance element 
discussed above from both the information from ASHTA as well as the European literature. A 
total environmental compliance cost savings factor was obtained from the sum of all the 
individual elements in each data set. Since ASHTA did not provide data related to annual cost of 
handling mercury-related wastes, the value from the literature was used to obtain a total from all 
media. With this approach, a value of $7.15/ton Cl2 shown in Table 3-5, was developed from 
data mostly from ASHTA, and a value of $4.63/ton Cl2 was developed from the European 
literature.

Table 3-6 presents the estimated annual cost savings from the elimination of mercury-
related compliance costs for each of the four U.S. facilities using both total environmental 
compliance saving cost factors from Table 3-5. Since the cost data found in the literature were 
based on facilities in Europe and not from actual U.S. facilities, we believe that the annual cost 
savings from the elimination of mercury that is based mostly on the ASHTA cost factors 
represent the best estimate of the cost savings for the remaining U.S. facilities.

3.2.4 Energy Savings and Costs 
The membrane cell process requires less electricity than the mercury cell process. 
Therefore, there are reduced energy requirements with membrane cells as compared to mercury 
cells. Energy cost savings due to reduced electricity usage were estimated using information 
from literature and average State electricity prices.12 Although there could be variations in local 
electricity costs, according to the information in the literature, the electricity used by the 
membrane cell technology is approximately 2,500 kilowatt hours per ton chlorine produced 
(kWh/ton Cl2), which is about 700 kWh/ton Cl2 less than that used by the mercury cell process 
(3,230 kWh/ton Cl2).12 This equates to an approximately 22 percent reduction in electricity 
usage. The total chlorine production capacity of the four mercury cell plants is 500,000 tons per 
year. Using the 700 kWh/ton decrease in electricity usage, the total estimated electricity 
reduction after conversion of the four plants would be around 350 million kWh/year, or 350,000 
Megawatt hours/year. 
 3-15 
Oceana provided information that indicated that a 37.5 percent reduction was Applying a 
37.5 percent reduction to the mercury cell process electricity usage estimate of 3,230 kWhr/ton 
Cl2 would yield a reduction in energy usage of approximately 1,211 kWhr/ton Cl2. 
These energy cost savings from reduced electricity usage are slightly offset by an 
increase in energy required to concentrate the caustic co-product generated in the membrane cell 
process. Mercury cells produce caustic at the market concentration of 50 percent, and membrane 
cells produce caustic at a 33 percent concentration. Therefore, there is an increase in energy use 
(in the form of steam) due to the need to further concentrate the caustic produced with the 
membrane cell technology. 
The energy requirement (in the form of steam) to concentrate the caustic to 50 percent 
was estimated to be 601 kWh/ton Cl2 ($13.6/ton Cl2), as obtained from the average of estimates 
provided for three U.S. facilities. This cost was deducted from the energy savings described 
above to develop an estimate of overall energy cost savings with membrane cell technology due 
to reduced energy needs. The energy cost savings are shown in Table 3-7.  
Further evaluation of Oceana’s claim of a 37.5 percent energy cost reduction26
In their September 29, 2009, letter, Oceana stated that the steam cost was an overestimate 
of the required energy needs to concentrate the caustic. Oceana argued that even though 
additional energy is required to generate steam, the steam could be obtained without additional 
expense. According to Oceana, facilities could use byproduct hydrogen as fuel to generate the 
necessary steam. While it may be possible to assume that byproduct hydrogen could be used to 
generate the steam required to concentrate caustic from a membrane cell, we agree with 
industry’s claim that increases in the demand for and the value of high purity chemical hydrogen 
make this use of byproduct hydrogen economically impractical. Therefore, we have not made 
adjustments to the energy usage costs (in the form of steam) based on the use of byproduct 
hydrogen as fuel. 
 shows that 
although the estimate is for an actual facility, it is not clear whether steam costs are included. In 
addition, Oceana also indicated in their September 16, 2009, letter that a 25 percent reduction 
was commonplace. Therefore, we believe that the total energy cost savings based on the 
22 percent electricity usage reduction represents the best cost estimate.

3.2.5 Overall Annual Costs  
For each of the costs and savings elements discussed in the previous sections, there is 
credible information that would result in different estimated levels of costs/savings. For each 
element, this resulted in a high- and low-end estimate. These values are shown in Table 3-8. 
For each element, we chose the method of estimation that we believe is the best estimate 
of the cost or savings, as follows: 
 For capital recovery costs and mercury storage costs, we concluded that neither 
the high-end nor the low-end of the ranges represented the best estimate of the 
costs that would be incurred. Instead, we concluded that using a 20-year finance 
period provided the best estimate. (See Table 3-3 above.) 
 For the mercury storage costs, we determined that the midpoint of the range of 
data from two sources (list) was the best estimate. (See Table 3-4 above.)

 For the environmental compliance savings element, we chose the higher estimated 
savings, using the cost factors developed mostly from ASHTA data to provide the 
best estimate for these U.S. facilities. (See Table 3-6 above.) 
 For the energy savings, we believe that the lower savings level based on a 
22 percent electricity usage reduction provides the best estimate. (See Table 3-7 
above.)  
Table 3-9 shows the estimates for each facility for each individual cost element that 
incorporate the choices described above, and also shows the total annual costs calculated using 
these estimates for each facility for conversion to non-mercury technology. The values in 
Table 3-9 represent our best estimate of the annual costs that would be incurred due to the 
conversion of the four currently operating mercury cell facilities to membrane cells. These 
annual costs range from less than $1 million per year for ASHTA to almost $7 million per year 
for Olin TN, and a total estimate of $13 million for all four facilities. 
3.3 Uncertainty Analysis 
While we selected the values that we believe provide the best estimates of the costs that 
would be incurred and savings that would be realized in the conversion from mercury cells to 
membrane cells at these four facilities, there is some uncertainty associated with the estimates. 
While most of the information obtained and provided by commenters appears to be credible and 
representative of actual conversions that have occurred, there is a high amount of variability. 
This is most likely due to the fact that the conditions associated with the potential conversion of 
 3-18 
each mercury cell plant are different, resulting in potentially significant differences in the costs 
and savings.

In order to consider the uncertainties, we conducted a simple Monte Carlo simulation.28
                                                 
28 Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that is used to account for uncertainty in 
quantitative analyses and is often used in decision making and risk analysis. The simulation technique builds 
models of possible results by substituting a range of values –often a probability distribution—for any factor that 
has inherent uncertainty, and then recalculates the results numerous times, each time using a different set of 
random values from the probability functions. The results of Monte Carlo analyses are distributions of possible 
outcome values. 
 
For this simulation, we assumed a normal distribution for each variable. We set the peak of the 
distribution at our best estimate. For the elements where we believe one end of the range 
provides the best estimate (i.e., the environmental compliance savings and the energy savings), 
we truncated the distribution so that the peak of the distribution curve was at the best estimate. 
We ran the simulation with 100,000 calculations to create distributions of the individual plant 
annual costs over all annual costs. The results are shown in Table 3-10. As can be seen, the 
results of this analysis are very close to our best estimated costs. This shows that collectively, 
considering the ranges of each parameter/input to the annual costs, a mean value is obtained from 
the simulation that is only slightly lower (4 percent) than our estimate.

3.4 Summary of Results  
For Option 1 (Non-mercury Technology Option), this section provided estimated costs 
for the conversion of the four currently operating mercury cell chlor-alkali facilities to membrane 
cells. The EPA estimate of the total capital cost for this conversion is slightly under $300 
million, with the EPA estimate of total annual costs at approximately $13 million. Per facility 
estimated costs range from a low of $828,117 (ASHTA) to $6,653,173 (Olin TN). 
For Option 2 (Enhanced Work Practice Standards Option), only the ASHTA facility 
incurs costs.  These costs are estimated to be $120 thousand in capital costs and $25 thousand in 
total annualized costs.

SECTION 4  
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS (EIA) 
EPA prepares an EIA to provide information about a new environmental policy’s 
unfavorable effects (i.e., social costs) and how these costs are distributed among stakeholders 
(EPA, 2000). Although several tools are available to estimate the economic costs of direct 
performance standards, the proposed regulation is unique in that it bans emissions of mercury 
from the mercury cell process within 2 years from final promulgation and bans operation of 
mercury recovery units 3 years from final promulgation. EPA’s Guidelines note that this type of 
regulation can be more difficult to assess when compared with traditional direct performance 
standards because it is hard to predict how stakeholders will respond (EPA, 2000). Bans may 
lead to shutdowns that will involve adjustment costs for people working at the affected plants. 
Affected plants may also have strong links with other firms or downstream markets; as a result, 
secondary consequences of the regulation become more important to consider. 
4.1 Conversion Versus Plant Closure 
The facilities currently in operation that do not already have plans to convert or close 
would have to convert to one of the non-mercury technologies, such as membrane cells. As a 
result, the owners of a plant have to make an investment decision that compares the costs of 
conversion with future benefits of the conversion. Although there is historical evidence that 
owners have converted from mercury technologies in Europe and United States, other mercury 
plant owners have, to date, concluded the investment decision was currently not in their 
company’s interest given their assessment of future economic conditions (U.S. House of 
Representatives Committee on Commerce and Energy, 2009; PPG, 2009). The extremely 
concentrated markets (few suppliers) for some chlor-alkali products may provide manufacturers 
with an ability to pass on cost increases. ASHTA is one of only three producers of liquid potcarb 
and domestic entry is very difficult. 
Although EPA does not have quantitative data to evaluate investment decisions (e.g., 
using capital budgeting techniques), the economics literature has emphasized three 
characteristics that influence the owner’s best investment decision (Dixit and Pyndick, 2004): 
 Uncertainty: the future rewards of an investment are unknown 
 Irreversibility: the resources used to make the investment typically cannot be 
undone 
 4-2 
 Timing: owners who delay investment get more information that they value; as a 
result, there is an “opportunity cost” associated with making an investment 
decision now versus later 
Supply and demand conditions in the chlor-alkali product markets are highly variable; 
chlor-alkali product prices regularly spike and fall during short periods (see Figure 4-1). Olin 
Corporation reports that the average product price for chlorine-caustic soda co product 
(electrochemical unit or ECU) dropped from approximately $1,300 per short ton to just under 
$600 per short ton in the first 6 months of 2009 (Olin Corporation, 2009). Figure 4.1 (below) 
shows that the long term price trend for chlor alkali products shows that prices have more than 
doubled since 2004, even when considering the recent price decreases.  
 
Figure 4-1. Price Trends: Alkalis and Chlorine Manufacturing: 2000 to 2009

The sharp price changes highlight the risks associated with chlor-alkali capital 
investments. For example, OxyChem completed an announced $60 million investment at its 
membrane chlor-alkali plant in Taft, Louisiana, to produce KOH instead of caustic potash 
(Access Intelligence, LLC, 2008). Almost a year later, an announcement suggests the plant has 
idled because of unstable market conditions (Access Intelligence, LLC, 2009).

Given the current market conditions, the benefits of delaying investment and waiting for 
new information are likely large if plants can delay conversion decisions. However, if plants 
delay, they risk other manufacturers entering the market before them and losing profits and 
market share. If for example, there are industrial consumers of chlorine nearby, it is unlikely that 
chlorine manufacturers will not meet that demand. And it appears to be cost-effective to produce 
chlor alkali products close to large industrial consumers. Firms would like to require rates of 
return that exceed the cost of capital to make new capital investments now. As reported above, 
prices for large industrial consumers of these facilities’ products could be sufficient to justify the 
investment in conversion 
To our knowledge, the only existing economics literature that examines regulation-
induced plant closures in the chlor-alkali industry is a study by Snyder and colleagues (2003). 
Environmental regulations affecting chlorine end-use markets have reduced the demand for 
chlorine and help explain the exit of selected chlorine plants (Snyder, Miller, and Stavins, 2003). 
For example, chlorine plants that were co-located with pulp and paper mills and plants affected 
by the Montreal Protocol were more likely to shutdown (11 to 15% higher than the average 
chlorine plant) (Snyder, Miller, and Stavins, 2003). In our case, the demand for chlorine and 
other products is not changing with the regulation. In contrast, regulatory factors did not appear 
to influence the decision to adopt membrane technologies at existing plants. EPA does not have 
sufficient data to predict whether individual companies would choose to convert or close, 
historical responses suggest that plant closure may be an option considered by some of these 
facilities. Of the last four plants to stop using this process, two converted and two closed. 
4.2 Market Concentration and Pricing Behavior 
Of the three major chlor-alkali products discussed in Section 2, the market for potassium 
hydroxide is the most highly concentrated. As of 2005, there were only four producers of 
potassium hydroxide in the United States (FTC, 2005b). Approximately 50% is produced using 
mercury cells; ASHTA Chemicals, Inc. reports a market share of approximately 15% (U.S. 
House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Energy, 2009). Producers of potassium 
hydroxide may have more ability to pass on costs of conversion than producers of other chlor-
alkali products. Any closure of one or more mercury cell plants could raise concerns about 
competitiveness and subsequent firm pricing behavior in the KOH market; the remaining 
companies could have more scope to influence market prices by altering production levels. 
Given the small number of remaining KOH producers, removing an extra ton of KOH from the 
market may raise the market price and increase the profits on all the other KOH sold. If the price 
effect is large enough, the remaining companies may find it is more profitable to reduce 
 4-4 
production levels below the levels that they would be choose in a market with a large number of 
competitors.  
EPA’s review of publicly available sources also suggests that any closure would have 
similar market concentration consequences for a downstream commodity: potassium carbonate. 
ASHTA is one of only three producers of liquid potcarb and domestic entry is very difficult 
because it is very expensive; foreign entry (i.e., imports) has historically been limited (FTC, 
2009b). In the absence of other market condition changes if ASHTA’s were to close, it would 
likely reduce competition and lead to higher prices in the liquid potcarb market. Although EPA 
does not have data to quantify the effect of higher potassium carbonate prices, we recognize that 
end users of potassium carbonate (e.g., specialty glasses including television tubes and the 
ceramics industry [Armond Products Company, 2009; ERCO Worldwide, 2009]) and the 
consumers of these goods could indirectly be affected by a price increase.29
4.3 Impact on Employment 
 Industry sources 
already suggest that high energy costs and reduced domestic demand in the video glass industry 
has contributed potassium carbonate industry decline although there is some evidence that other 
“niche” end users are emerging (Hoffmann, 2004).  
EPA does not have enough information to estimate whether individual plants will convert 
or close and therefore no estimate of changes in employment are provided. In the following 
section we provide information on each plants’ job contributions relative to the size of local 
labor markets and current and historical conditions. In Table 4-1, we use the latest monthly 
statistics about county labor forces and show the relative contributions of each plant in the 
context of current labor market conditions. In Figure 4-2, we compare the historical 
unemployment rates in the United States with unemployment rates for the counties where 
mercury cells are located. As shown in Figure 4-3, annual unemployment rates for three counties 
(Ashtabula, Richmond, and Wetzel) diverge and become higher than the national average 
beginning in 2004. Recent data for the month of May 2009 also suggest the relative difference 
between Ashtabula County and the United States is higher than historical differences. 
                                                 
29 Companies using potassium products may also be concerned about other events that tend to increase the cost of 
potassium products (e.g., recent increases in the input costs of potash used to make potassium hydroxide). For 
example, Superior Plus (2008) notes that a current contract to purchase potash on favorable terms expired in 
2009, and production costs are likely to rise once potash is purchased at current (higher) market prices. Superior 
plus owns ERCO Worldwide, one of the four companies that compete in the U.S. potassium hydroxide market.

4.4 Transportation Issues Associated with Plant Closure 
If one or more mercury cell plants were to close, customers with existing arrangements 
with the plants will have to identify another outside supply source to maintain chemical 
production. For example, ASHTA’s production facility sells 100% of its chlorine to an adjacent 
titanium dioxide plant (U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Commerce and Energy, 
2009). Although other chlorine supply sources may be available, transportation will likely be 
more expensive because of increased shipping distances between the supply source and its 
destination. Depending on the mode of transportation selected, this may also indirectly increase 
the volume of existing shipments passing through certain urban areas.

certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities (SISNOSE). The first step in this assessment was to determine whether the rule 
will have SISNOSE. To make this determination, EPA used an impact analysis to indicate 
whether EPA can certify the rule as not having a SISNOSE. The elements of this analysis 
included 
 identifying affected small entities, 
 selecting and describing the measures and economic impact thresholds used in the 
analysis, and 
 completing the assessment and determining the SISNOSE certification category. 
4.5.1 Identify Affected Small Entities 
For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities, a small 
entity is defined as (1) a small business as defined by the Small Business Administration’s 
regulations at 13 CFR 121.201; according to these size standards, ultimate parent companies 
owning mercury cell chlor-alkali facilities are categorized as small if the total number of 
employees at the ultimate parent company is fewer than 500; otherwise, the ultimate parent 
company is classified as large. As discussed in the previous section, ASHTA, Inc. is the sole 
entity that meets these qualifications.  
4.5.2 Sales Test Analysis 
EPA assessed how the regulatory program may influence the profitability of ultimate 
parent companies by comparing annual conversion costs to total sales (i.e., a “sales” test). To do 
this, we divided an ultimate parent company’s total annualized compliance costs by its reported 
revenue: 
 
j
n
i
TR
TACC
CSR
∑
=  (4.1) 
where  
CSR = cost-to-sales ratio 
TACC = total annualized compliance costs 
TRj = total sales from all operations of ultimate parent company j or annual 
government revenue 
 4-8 
This method assumes the affected entity cannot shift pollution control costs to consumers 
(in the form of higher market prices). Instead, the owning entity experiences a one-for-one 
reduction in profits. For Option 1, EPA estimates that ASHTA’s CSR would range from 1 to 2%, 
which suggests a significant economic impact. For Option 2, EPA estimates that ASHTA’s CSR 
would be less than 0.1%. The other three plants are owned by large ultimate parent companies 
with significant company-wide sales. As a result, the CSRs for the large companies are below 
1%. However, when plant-only sales are considered, the CSRs for plants owned by large 
ultimate parent companies range from 4 to 9%. 
4.5.3 Profit Test Analysis 
Economic models assume that a chlor-alkali company acts in the best interest of its 
shareholders and tries to make the company’s profit (total revenue minus total costs) as large as 
possible. To measure of chlor-alkali profits, EPA used trade publication data for a representative 
ECU called the “cash margin” (CMAI, 2008). The measure approximates the average profit per 
metric ton of chlor-alkali product made. As shown in Figure 4-4, historical data suggest that cash 
margins can fluctuate over time. Assuming the market prices for chlor-alkali products do not 
change as a result of the proposed rule, the annual conversion costs ($/metric ton) associated 
with the proposed rule will reduce the average profit for chlor-alkali products. To assess the size 
of this effect, EPA compared the conversion costs with economic data for a typical year (using 
historical industry ECU margins and capacity utilization rates from 1991 to 2005).30
4.6 Conclusions 
 As shown, 
conversion costs could reduce the margins by 10 to 20% (Figure 4-5). EPA also considered data 
in weak and strong margin years; as shown, margin reductions range from 5 to 100% for these 
years. As a result, the analysis confirms the results associated with the sales test; plant 
conversion costs will likely have an economically significant effect. 
The EIA suggests Option 1 requirements are likely to have significant economic costs. 
Plants will either convert or close. Predicting whether, no plant, one plant, two plants, three 
plants, or all four plants will close or convert is not possible with the available data.  
                                                 
30 For a typical year, we used the observed average industry ECU cash margin (2008 dollars) and average industry 
utilization rate between 1991 and 2005. For weak and strong years, we considered cash margins and industry 
utilization rates one standard deviation (lower and higher) from the average.

Source: EPA estimates using data from CMAI (2008). 
Closure of one or more mercury cell process plants also raises concerns about 
competitiveness and subsequent pricing behavior in the potassium hydroxide and potassium 
carbonate markets. In highly concentrated markets with few producers, nonmercury cell 
producers may be able to influence market prices above competitive levels by altering 
production decisions. Similar competitive issues have also been raised in other regulatory 
contexts. 
The small business impact analysis shows that one of the four plants is owned by a small 
business. A sales test suggests this small company will be significantly affected (CSR would 
range from 1 to 2% for Option 1). EPA also considered profitability effects by comparing annual 
conversion costs to reported industry margins for a representative ECU. Even in optimistic 
scenarios where ECU margins are higher than historical averages, conversion costs could 
significantly reduce the margins.

SECTION 5  
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
5.1 Synopsis 
In this section, we provide analysis of the benefits associated with the proposed Mercury 
Chlor Alkali NESHAP. As there are no emission reductions or energy impacts associated with 
Option 2 (enhanced work practice standards), the benefits in this chapter correspond to Option 1 
(non-mercury technology option). The primary benefit of this regulation is the reduction of 
mercury emissions from these sources. Due to data, time, and resource limitations, we were 
unable to model mercury dispersion, deposition, methylation, bioaccumulation in fish tissue, and 
human consumption of mercury-contaminated fish that would be needed in order to estimate the 
human health benefits from reducing mercury emissions. In addition, this regulation would 
reduce electricity demand at these sources. Using benefit-per-ton estimates, we estimate the 
monetized human health co-benefits of reducing cases of morbidity and premature mortality 
among populations exposed to particulate matter (PM) associated with the decreased electricity 
usage. Using the social cost of carbon (SCC), we estimate the monetized benefits associated with 
reduced CO2 emissions. At a 3% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized co-benefits of the 
proposed NESHAP to be $22 million to $43 million in the implementation year (2013). At a 7% 
discount rate, we estimate the total monetized co-benefits of the proposed NESHAP to be $14 
million to $33 million in 2013. All estimates are in 2007$. These estimates reflect EPA’s most 
current interpretation of the scientific literature. Higher or lower estimates of PM2.5 co-benefits 
are possible using other assumptions; examples of this are provided in Figure 5-2 and Table 5-6. 
Data, resource, and methodological limitations prevented EPA from monetizing the co-benefits 
from several important benefit categories, including benefits from reducing ecosystem effects 
and visibility impairment. It is important to emphasize that these monetized co-benefits do not 
include the benefits associated with reducing mercury emissions. 
5.2 Mercury Benefits 
Mercury is a highly neurotoxic contaminant that enters the food web as a methylated 
compound, methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2008c). The contaminant is concentrated in higher 
trophic levels, including fish eaten by humans. Mercury is emitted to the air from various man-
made and natural sources. These emissions transport through the atmosphere and eventually 
deposit to land or water bodies. This deposition can occur locally, regionally, or globally, 
depending on the form of mercury emitted and other factors such as the weather. The form of 
mercury emitted from these sources is estimated to be about 98 percent elemental and two 
percent divalent mercury. Gaseous elemental mercury can be transported very long distances, 
 5-2 
even globally, to regions far from the emissions source (becoming part of the global “pool”) 
before deposition occurs. Inorganic ionic (divalent) mercury has a shorter atmospheric lifetime 
and can deposit to land or water bodies closer to the emissions source. Furthermore, elemental 
mercury in the atmosphere can undergo transformation into ionic mercury, providing a 
significant pathway for deposition of emitted elemental mercury. 
This source category emitted about 640 pounds of mercury in the air in 2008 in the U.S. 
Based on the EPA’s National Emission Inventory, about 103 tons of mercury were emitted from 
all anthropogenic sources in the U.S. in 2005. Moreover, the United Nations has estimated that 
about 2,100 tons of mercury were emitted worldwide by anthropogenic sources in 2005. We 
believe that total mercury emissions in the U.S. and globally in 2008 were about the same 
magnitude in 2005. Therefore, we estimate that in 2008, these sources emitted about 0.3% of the 
total anthropogenic mercury emissions in the U.S. and about 0.02% of the global emissions. 
Overall, this rule would directly reduce mercury emissions by about 640 pounds per year from 
current levels as well as an estimated 16 pounds per year indirectly through reduced electricity 
generation, and therefore, contribute to reductions in mercury exposures and health effects. Due 
to data, time, and resource limitations, we were unable to model mercury dispersion, deposition, 
methylation, bioaccumulation in fish tissue, and human consumption of mercury-contaminated 
fish that would be needed in order to estimate the human health benefits from reducing mercury 
emissions.  
Potential exposure routes to mercury emissions include both direct inhalation and 
consumption of fish containing methylmercury. In the U.S., the primary route of human 
exposure to mercury emissions from industrial sources is generally indirectly through the 
consumption of fish containing methylmercury. As described above, mercury that has been 
emitted to the air eventually settles into water bodies or onto land where it can either move 
directly or be leached into waterbodies. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it 
into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. 
Consumption of fish and shellfish are the main sources of methylmercury exposure to humans. 
Methylmercury builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than in others. The levels of 
methylmercury in fish and shellfish vary widely depending on what they eat, how long they live, 
and how high they are in the food chain. Most fish, including ocean species and local freshwater 
fish, contain some methylmercury. For example, in recent studies by EPA and the U.S. 
Geological Survey (USGS) of fish tissues, every fish sampled from 291 streams across the 
country contained some methylmercury (Scudder, 2009).  
 5-3 
The majority of fish consumed in the U.S. are ocean species. The methylmercury 
concentrations in ocean fish species are primarily influenced by the global mercury pool. 
However, the methylmercury found in local fish can be due, at least partly, to mercury emissions 
from local sources. Research shows that most people’s fish consumption does not cause a 
mercury-related health concern. However, certain people may be at higher risk because of their 
routinely high consumption of fish (e.g., tribal and other subsistence fishers and their families 
who rely heavily on fish for a substantial part of their diet). It has been demonstrated that high 
levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the 
developing nervous system, making the child less able to think and learn. Moreover, mercury 
exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people 
of all ages.  
Several studies suggest that the methylmercury content of fish may reduce these cardio-
protective effects of fish consumption. Some of these studies also suggest that methylmercury 
may cause adverse effects to the cardiovascular system. For example, the NRC (2000) review of 
the literature concerning methylmercury health effects took note of two epidemiological studies 
that found an association between dietary exposure to methylmercury and adverse cardiovascular 
effects.31 Moreover, in a study of 1,833 males in Finland aged 42 to 60 years, Solonen et al. 
(1995) observed a relationship between methylmercury exposure via fish consumption and acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attacks), coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and 
all-cause mortality.32 The NRC also noted a study of 917 seven year old children in the Faroe 
Islands, whose initial exposure to methylmercury was in utero although post natal exposures may 
have occurred as well. At seven years of age, these children exhibited an increase in blood 
pressure and a decrease in heart rate variability.33 Based on these and other studies, NRC 
concluded in 2000 that, while “the data base is not as extensive for cardiovascular effects as it is 
for other end points (i.e., neurologic effects) the cardiovascular system appears to be a target for 
methylmercury toxicity.”34

Since publication of the NRC report there have been some 30 published papers 
presenting the findings of studies that have examined the possible cardiovascular effects of 
methylmercury exposure. These studies include epidemiological, toxicological, and toxicokinetic 
investigations. Over a dozen review papers have also been published. If there is a causal 
relationship between methylmercury exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects, then reducing 
exposure to methylmercury would result in public health benefits from reduced cardiovascular 
effects. 
In early 2010, EPA sponsored a workshop in which a group of experts were asked to 
assess the plausibility of a causal relationship between methylmercury exposure and 
cardiovascular health effects and to advise EPA on methodologies for estimating population 
level cardiovascular health impacts of reduced methylmercury exposure. The report from that 
workshop is in preparation. 
5.3 Energy Savings Co-benefits 
Because the membrane cell process requires less energy than the mercury cell process, 
this rule is anticipated to reduce electricity generated for these facilities by over 375 million 
kilowatt hours. Assuming a 22% reduction in electricity demand, the emission reductions 
associated with reduced electricity generation are estimated to be 68 tpy of PM2.5, 0.008 tpy (16 
lbs) of mercury, and 287,000 tpy of CO2. The methodology for calculating these emission 
reductions is provided in Appendix B of this RIA.  
5.3.1 PM2.5 Co-benefits 
The energy savings anticipated from this rule would decrease emissions of PM, thus 
reducing human exposure, and the incidence of PM2.5-related health effects. Due to time and 
resource limitations, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive estimate of the PM2.5-related 
co-benefits. Instead, we used the “benefit-per-ton” approach to estimate these co-benefits based 
on the methodology described in Fann, Fulcher, and Hubbell (2009). These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton 
estimates provide the total monetized human health co-benefits (the sum of premature mortality 
and premature morbidity) of reducing one ton of PM2.5 from a specified source. EPA has used the 
benefit per-ton technique in several previous RIAs, including the recent proposed Cement 
NESHAP (U.S. EPA, 2009a). For this analysis, we use the national average benefit-per-ton 
estimates associated with the electrical generating unit (EGU) sector. Because the anticipated 
emission reductions are assumed to occur across multiple EGUs, the national average benefit-
per-ton estimates best represent the regional scope of the anticipated emission reductions.

Table 5-1 identifies the quantified and unquantified co-benefits captured in those benefit-per-ton 
estimates.

Consistent with the Portland Cement NESHAP (U.S. EPA, 2009a), the PM2.5 co-benefits 
estimates utilize the concentration-response functions as reported in the epidemiology literature, 
as well as the 12 functions obtained in EPA’s expert elicitation study as a sensitivity analysis. 
 One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed 
from the extended analysis of American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as reported 
in Pope et al. (2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary 
benefits estimate. When calculating the estimate, EPA applied the effect 
coefficient as reported in the study without an adjustment for assumed 
concentration threshold of 10 µg/m3 as was done in recent (2006–2009) Office of 
Air and Radiation RIAs. 
 One estimate is based on the C-R function developed from the extended analysis 
of the Harvard Six Cities cohort, as reported by Laden et al. (2006). This study, 
published after the completion of the Staff Paper for the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS, has 
been used as an alternative estimate in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and PM2.5 benefits 
estimates in RIAs completed since the PM2.5 NAAQS. When calculating the 
estimate, EPA applied the effect coefficient as reported in the study without an 
adjustment for assumed concentration threshold of 10 µg/m3 as was done in 
recent (2006–2009) RIAs.  
 Twelve estimates are based on the C-R functions from EPA’s expert elicitation 
study (IEc, 2006; Roman et al., 2008) on the PM2.5 -mortality relationship and 
interpreted for benefits analysis in EPA’s final RIA for the PM2.5 NAAQS. For 
 5-6 
that study, twelve experts (labeled A through L) provided independent estimates 
of the PM2.5 -mortality concentration-response function. EPA practice has been to 
develop independent estimates of PM2.5 -mortality estimates corresponding to the 
concentration-response function provided by each of the twelve experts, to better 
characterize the degree of variability in the expert responses. 
The effect coefficients are drawn from epidemiology studies examining two large 
population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002) and the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006).35 These are logical choices for anchor points in our 
presentation because, while both studies are well designed and peer reviewed, there are strengths 
and weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for using both studies to generate co-
benefits estimates. Previously, EPA had calculated co-benefits based on these two empirical 
studies, but derived the range of co-benefits, including the minimum and maximum results, from 
an expert elicitation of the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and premature mortality 
(Roman et al., 2008).36
Readers interested in reviewing the methodology for creating the benefit-per-ton 
estimates used in this analysis should consult Fann, Fulcher, and Hubbell (2009). As described in 
the documentation for the benefit per-ton estimates cited above, national per-ton estimates are 
developed for selected pollutant/source category combinations. The per-ton values calculated 
therefore apply only to tons reduced from those specific pollutant/source combinations (e.g., 
NOx emitted from electric generating units; NO2 emitted from mobile sources). Our estimate of 
PM2.5 control co-benefits is therefore based on the total PM2.5 emissions controlled by sector and 
multiplied by this per-ton value. 
 Within this assessment, we include the co-benefits estimates derived 
from the concentration-response function provided by each of the twelve experts to better 
characterize the uncertainty in the concentration-response function for mortality and the degree 
of variability in the expert responses. Because the experts used these cohort studies to inform 
their concentration-response functions, co-benefits estimates using these functions generally fall 
between results using these epidemiology studies (see Figure 6-2). In general, the expert 
elicitation results support the conclusion that the co-benefits of PM2.5 control are very likely to be 
substantial. 
The benefit-per-ton coefficients in this analysis were derived using modified versions of 
the health impact functions used in the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis. Specifically, 
this analysis uses the benefit-per-ton method first applied in the Portland Cement NESHAP RIA 
                                                 
35 These two studies specify multi-pollutant models that control for NOX, among other pollutants. 
36 Please see the Section 5.2 of the Portland Cement proposal RIA in Appendix 5A for more information regarding 
the change in the presentation of co-benefits estimates.  
 5-7 
(U.S. EPA, 2009a), which incorporated three updates: a new population dataset, an expanded 
geographic scope of the benefit-per-ton calculation, and the functions directly from the 
epidemiology studies without an adjustment for an assumed threshold.37
EPA strives to use the best available science to support our benefits analyses, and we 
recognize that interpretation of the science regarding air pollution and health is dynamic and 
evolving. Based on our review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA now estimates 
PM-related mortality without applying an assumed concentration threshold. EPA’s Integrated 
Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2009b), which was recently reviewed by 
EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 
2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-threshold log-linear 
model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship while 
recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the concentration-response function. 
Since then, the Health Effects Subcommittee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2010) of EPA’s Council 
concluded, “The HES fully supports EPA’s decision to use a no-threshold model to estimate 
mortality reductions. This decision is supported by the data, which are quite consistent in 
showing effects down to the lowest measured levels. Analyses of cohorts using data from more 
recent years, during which time PM concentrations have fallen, continue to report strong 
associations with mortality. Therefore, there is no evidence to support a truncation of the CRF.” 
In conjunction with the underlying scientific literature, this document provided a basis for 
reconsidering the application of thresholds in PM2.5 concentration-response functions used in 
EPA’s RIAs. For a summary of these scientific review statements and the panel members 
commenting on thresholds since 2002, please consult the Technical Support Document (TSD) 
Summary of Expert Opinions on the Existence of a Threshold (U.S. EPA, 2010c). 
 Removing the threshold 
assumption is a key difference between the method used in this analysis of PM co-benefits and 
the methods used in RIAs prior to Portland Cement, and we now calculate incremental co-
benefits down to the lowest modeled PM2.5 air quality levels. 
Consistent with this finding, we have conformed the previous threshold sensitivity 
analysis to the current state of the PM science by incorporating a new “Lowest Measured Level” 
(LML) assessment. This information allows readers to determine the portion of population 
exposed to annual mean PM2.5 levels at or above the LML of each study; in general, our 
confidence in the estimated PM mortality decreases as we consider air quality levels further 
below the LML in major cohort studies that estimate PM-related mortality. While an LML 
                                                 
37 The benefit-per-ton estimates have also been updated since the Cement RIA to incorporate a revised VSL, as 
discussed on the next page.  
 5-8 
assessment provides some insight into the level of uncertainty in the estimated PM mortality 
benefits, EPA does not view the LML as a threshold and continues to quantify PM-related 
mortality impacts using a full range of modeled air quality concentrations. It is important to 
emphasize that we have high confidence in PM2.5-related effects down to the lowest LML of the 
major cohort studies, which is 5.8 µg/m3. Just because we have greater confidence in the benefits 
above the LML, this does not mean that we have no confidence that benefits occur below the 
LML. 
For this analysis, policy-specific air quality data is not available due to time or resource 
limitations. For these rules, we are unable to estimate the percentage of premature mortality 
associated with this specific rule’s emission reductions at each PM2.5 level. However, we believe 
that it is still important to characterize the distribution of exposure to baseline air quality levels. 
As a surrogate measure of mortality impacts, we provide the percentage of the population 
exposed at each PM2.5 level using the most recent modeling available from the recently proposed 
Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010e). It is important to note that baseline exposure is only one 
parameter in the health impact function, along with baseline incidence rates population, and 
change in air quality. In other words, the percentage of the population exposed to air pollution 
below the LML is not the same as the percentage of the population experiencing health impacts 
as a result of a specific emission reduction policy. The most important aspect, which we are 
unable to quantify for rules without air quality modeling, is the shift in exposure associated with 
this specific rule. Therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting the LML assessment. For 
more information on the data and conclusions in the LML assessment for rules without policy-
specific air quality modeling, please consult the LML TSD (U.S. EPA, 2010d). The results of 
this analysis are provided in Section 5.4. 
As is the nature of Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs), the assumptions and methods 
used to estimate air quality co-benefits evolve over time to reflect the Agency’s most current 
interpretation of the scientific and economic literature. For a period of time (2004–2008), the 
Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued mortality risk reductions using a value of statistical 
life (VSL) estimate derived from a limited analysis of some of the available studies. OAR arrived 
at a VSL using a range of $1 million to $10 million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of 
the wage-risk literature. The $1 million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range 
from the Mrozek and Taylor (2002) meta-analysis of 33 studies. The $10 million value 
represented the upper end of the interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-
 5-9 
analysis of 43 studies. The mean estimate of $5.5 million (2000$)38
During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 
risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources. In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue. With input from the 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and 
different studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated 
preference) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2007). 
 was also consistent with the 
mean VSL of $5.4 million estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-analysis. However, the 
Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected 
the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board 
(SAB) or other peer-review group. 
Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received. Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)39 while the Agency continues its efforts to 
update its guidance on this issue. This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates 
derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 
1991. The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).40
Figure 5-1 illustrates the relative breakdown of the monetized PM2.5 health co-benefits by 
health endpoint. 
 The Agency is committed to 
using scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing mortality risk reductions 
and has made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC’s specific recommendations.  
                                                 
38 After adjusting the VSL for a different currency year (2007$) and to account for income growth to 2015 to the 
$5.5 million value, the VSL is $8.0 million.  
39 In the (draft) update of the Economic Guidelines (U.S. EPA, 2008b), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by the SAB 
with the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be forthcoming in the 
near future. Therefore, this report does not represent final agency policy.  
40 In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2007$) and to account for income 
growth to 2015. After applying these adjustments to the $6.3 million value, the VSL is $9.1 million.

Figure 5-1. Breakdown of Monetized PM2.5 Health Co-Benefits using Mortality Function 
from Pope et al. (2002)a 
a This pie chart breakdown is illustrative, using the results based on Pope et al. (2002) as an example. Using the 
Laden et al. (2006) function for premature mortality, the percentage of total monetized co-benefits due to adult 
mortality would be 97%. This chart shows the breakdown using a 3% discount rate, and the results would be 
similar if a 7% discount rate was used. 
Table 5-2 provides a general summary of the monetized co-benefits results by pollutant, 
including the emission reductions and benefits-per-ton estimates at discount rates of 3% and 
7%.41
                                                 
41 To comply with Circular A-4, EPA provides monetized co-benefits using discount rates of 3% and 7% (OMB, 
2003). These co-benefits are estimated for a specific analysis year (i.e., 2013), and most of the PM co-benefits 
occur within that year with two exceptions: acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) and premature mortality. For 
AMIs, we assume 5 years of follow-up medical costs and lost wages. For premature mortality, we assume that 
there is a “cessation” lag between PM exposures and the total realization of changes in health effects. Although 
the structure of the lag is uncertain, EPA follows the advice of the SAB-HES to assume a segmented lag 
structure characterized by 30% of mortality reductions in the first year, 50% over years 2 to 5, and 20% over the 
years 6 to 20 after the reduction in PM2.5 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004). Changes in the lag assumptions do not change 
the total number of estimated deaths but rather the timing of those deaths. Therefore, discounting only affects the 
AMI costs after the analysis year and the valuation of premature mortalities that occur after the analysis year. As 
such, the monetized co-benefits using a 7% discount rate are only approximately 10% less than the monetized 
co-benefits using a 3% discount rate.  
 Table 5-3 provides a summary of the reductions in health incidences anticipated as a result 
of the pollution reductions. In Table 5-4, we provide the monetized co-benefits using our anchor 
points of Pope et al. and Laden et al. as well as the results from the expert elicitation on PM 
mortality. Figure 5-2 provides a visual representation of the range of monetized co-benefits 
estimates and the pollutant breakdown of the monetized co-benefits of the proposed option. As

5.3.2 Social Cost of Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Co-benefits 
EPA has assigned a dollar value to reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using 
recent estimates of the “social cost of carbon” (SCC). The SCC is an estimate of the monetized 
damages associated with an incremental increase in carbon emissions in a given year. It is 
intended to include (but is not limited to) changes in net agricultural productivity, human health, 
property damages from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem services due to climate 
change. The SCC estimates used in this analysis were developed through an interagency process 
that included EPA and other executive branch entities, and concluded in February 2010. EPA 
first used these SCC estimates in the co-benefits analysis for the final joint EPA/DOT 
Rulemaking to establish Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy Standards; see the rule’s preamble for discussion about application of

SCC (75 FR 25324; 5/7/10). The SCC Technical Support Document (SCC TSD) provides a 
complete discussion of the methods used to develop these SCC estimates.42
The interagency group selected four SCC values for use in regulatory analyses, which we 
have applied in this analysis: $5, $21, $35, and $65 per metric ton of CO2 emissions
  
43
The SCC increases over time because future emissions are expected to produce larger 
incremental damages as physical and economic systems become more stressed in response to 
greater climatic change. Note that the interagency group estimated the growth rate of the SCC 
directly using the three integrated assessment models rather than assuming a constant annual 
growth rate. This helps to ensure that the estimates are internally consistent with other modeling 
assumptions. The SCC estimates for the analysis years of 2013, in 2007 dollars are provided in 
Table 5-5. 
 in 2010, in 
2007 dollars. The first three values are based on the average SCC from three integrated 
assessment models, at discount rates of 2.5, 3, and 5 percent, respectively. SCCs at several 
discount rates are included because the literature shows that the SCC is quite sensitive to 
assumptions about the discount rate, and because no consensus exists on the appropriate rate to 
use in an intergenerational context. The fourth value is the 95th percentile of the SCC from all 
three models at a 3 percent discount rate. It is included to represent higher-than-expected impacts 
from temperature change further out in the tails of the SCC distribution. Low probability, high 
impact events are incorporated into all of the SCC values through explicit consideration of their 
effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density function for 
equilibrium climate sensitivity. Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results in more high 
temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages.

43 The interagency group decided that these estimates apply only to CO2 emissions. Given that warming profiles and 
impacts other than temperature change (e.g., ocean acidification) vary across GHGs, the group concluded 
“transforming gases into CO2-equivalents using GWP, and then multiplying the carbon-equivalents by the SCC, 
would not result in accurate estimates of the social costs of non-CO2 gases” (SCC TSD, pg 13).

a The SCC values are dollar-year and emissions-year specific. SCC values represent only a partial accounting of 
climate impacts. 
When attempting to assess the incremental economic impacts of carbon dioxide 
emissions, the analyst faces a number of serious challenges. A recent report from the National 
Academies of Science (NRC, 2008) points out that any assessment will suffer from uncertainty, 
speculation, and lack of information about (1) future emissions of greenhouse gases, (2) the 
effects of past and future emissions on the climate system, (3) the impact of changes in climate 
on the physical and biological environment, and (4) the translation of these environmental 
impacts into economic damages. As a result, any effort to quantify and monetize the harms 
associated with climate change will raise serious questions of science, economics, and ethics and 
should be viewed as provisional.  
The interagency group noted a number of limitations to the SCC analysis, including the 
incomplete way in which the integrated assessment models capture catastrophic and non-
catastrophic impacts, their incomplete treatment of adaptation and technological change, 
uncertainty in the extrapolation of damages to high temperatures, and assumptions regarding risk 
aversion. The limited amount of research linking climate impacts to economic damages makes 
the interagency modeling exercise even more difficult. The interagency group hopes that over 
time researchers and modelers will work to fill these gaps and that the SCC estimates used for 
regulatory analysis by the Federal government will continue to evolve with improvements in 
modeling. Additional details on these limitations are discussed in the SCC TSD. 
In light of these limitations, the interagency group has committed to updating the current 
estimates as the science and economic understanding of climate change and its impacts on 
society improves over time. Specifically, the interagency group has set a preliminary goal of 
revisiting the SCC values within two years or at such time as substantially updated models 
become available, and to continue to support research in this area.

range of policy scenarios, we estimate the dollar value of the climate-related co-benefits captured 
by the models for each analysis year. For internal consistency, the annual co-benefits are 
discounted back to NPV terms using the same discount rate as each SCC estimate (i.e., 5%, 3%, 
and 2.5%) rather than 3% and 7%.44

climate impacts. 
5.3.3 Total Monetized Co-benefits of Energy Savings 
The energy savings would decrease emissions of several pollutants. In this analysis, we 
were able to monetize the co-benefits associated with the decreased emissions of PM and CO2, 
but we were unable to monetize the co-benefits associated with the decreased emissions of 
mercury. We estimate that the total monetized co-benefits are $22 to $43 million and $14 to $33 
million, at discount rates of 3% and 7% respectively. Figure 5-3 shows the breakdown of the 
monetized co-benefits by pollutant.  
5.4 Characterization of Uncertainty in the Monetized PM2.5 Co-Benefits 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. Many inputs 
are used to derive the estimate of monetized co-benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior). For some parameters or inputs it may be possible to provide a statistical representation 
of the underlying uncertainty distribution. For other parameters or inputs, the necessary 
information is not available. Because we used the benefit-per-ton approach for this analysis, 
confidence intervals are unavailable. 
                                                 
44 It is possible that other co-benefits or costs of proposed regulations unrelated to CO2 emissions will be discounted 
at rates that differ from those used to develop the SCC estimates.

There are uncertainties associated with each analytical step to calculate the human health 
benefits associated with reducing electricity consumption. Important uncertainties associated 
with estimating the reduction in electricity consumption include variability across facilities and 
variability in local energy costs. 45 Important uncertainties associated with estimating the 
emission reductions associated with a specific electricity consumption reduction include 
representativeness of historical emissions factors across regions and over time, transmission 
losses, electricity market response to changes in demand, and emissions trading effects. 46 
Important uncertainties associated with estimating the human health benefits associated with 
those emission reductions include assumptions regarding the PM2.5-related mortality relationship, 
the value-of-a-statistical-life, and average benefit-per-ton estimates.47
                                                 
45 These uncertainties are described in detail in Appendix B of this RIA. 
 It should be noted that the 
method used to the change in PM2.5 precursor emissions for this rule is consistent with the 
method used to calculated changes in CO2 emissions. Given the strong desire to estimate the 
effects of regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we will continue to investigate and 
improve the methodology for estimating all benefits categories associated with reducing 
electricity consumption, to the extent feasible. 
46 These uncertainties are described in detail in Appendix B of this RIA. 
47 These uncertainties are described in detail below. 
 5-18 
Although this is the first RIA for which U.S. EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation has 
calculated the monetized human health benefits specifically associated with a reduction in 
electricity consumption, there are several previous regulations that included the health benefits 
associated with energy changes. For example, the recently finalized Portland Cement NESHAP 
included the human health and climate disbenefits associated with increased electricity 
consumption and fuel usage from control devices (U.S. EPA, 2010i). U.S. EPA has previously 
calculated substantial human health benefits associated with reducing emissions from electrical 
generating units, including the proposed Federal Transport Rule (2010d), the SO2 NAAQS 
(2010g), and the Clean Air Interstate Rule (2005). In addition, several recent regulations from 
U.S. EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality assessed the air quality changes and 
associated human health impacts from changes in fuel consumption and/or fuel production and 
distribution, including the Light Duty Vehicle GHG rule (U.S. EPA, 2010f),48 Renewable Fuel 
Standard II rule (U.S. EPA, 2010e),49 and the Locomotive Marine rule (U.S. EPA, 2008a).50
In addition to RIAs, other recent attempts to calculate the human health benefits 
associated with electricity consumption are available in the literature. For example, Levy et al. 
(2009) estimated the median monetized health-related damages associated with emissions of 
PM2.5, SO2, and NOx from coal-fired power plants. In addition, the National Research Council 
(NRC) estimated the monetized health benefits associated emissions of PM, SO2, and NOx to be 
for coal and natural gas power plants. It is important to note that there are important 
methodological differences between these two analyses and EPA’s approach to estimating PM-
 
Furthermore, the Iron and Steel Foundries NESHAP (U.S. EPA, 2003) included an estimate of 
the emission reductions associated with decreased energy consumption for alternate control 
devices, but no benefits analysis was conducted for that rule. 
                                                 
48 In addition to downstream emission reductions, the Light Duty Vehicle GHG rule accounted for the emissions 
associated with the processes involved in getting petroleum to the pump, including the extraction and 
transportation of crude oil, and the production and distribution of finished gasoline. Changes were anticipated in 
upstream emissions due to the expected reduction in the volume of fuel consumed. Less gasoline consumed 
means less gasoline transported, less gasoline refined, and less crude oil extracted and transported to refineries. 
Thus, the analysis accounted for reductions in the emissions associated with each of these steps in the gasoline 
production and distribution process. 
49 In addition to the effects of increased renewable fuel use on emissions from the vehicles and equipment that use 
the fuels, the RFS2 analysis accounted for shifts in the fuel production and transport/distribution methods that 
can have substantial impacts on emissions. These "upstream" emissions are associated with all stages of biofuel 
production and distribution, including biomass production (agriculture, forestry), fertilizer and pesticide 
production and transport, biomass transport, biomass refining (corn or cellulosic ethanol production facilities), 
biofuel transport to blending/distribution terminals, and distribution of finished fuels to retail outlets.  
50 The locomotive and marine engine rule accounted for idle reduction technologies that provide substantial 
emission reductions as well as cost savings by reducing fuel consumption. Reduced idling time results in reduced 
fuel consumption and reduced idle emissions. The analysis estimated annual fuel savings, the associated cost 
savings, and the emissions reductions that would result from the idle reduction requirements.

related monetized benefits, including characterization of secondary formation of PM2.5, 
population growth, income growth, the VSL, the cessation lag assumed, among others. However, 
these studies provide additional examples of conceptually similar attempts to monetize the 
human health benefits associated with electricity consumption. 
The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 
the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year. Factors 
such as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately. As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5) (U.S. EPA, 
2006a), there are a variety of uncertainties associated with these PM co-benefits. Therefore, the 
estimates of annual co-benefits should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of co-
benefits expected, rather than the actual co-benefits that would occur every year. 
It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 
specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and co-benefits 
modeling assumptions. For example, these estimates do not reflect local variability in population 
density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors. Use of 
these $/ton values to estimate co-benefits associated with different emission control programs 
(e.g., for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) may lead to higher or 
lower benefit estimates than if co-benefits were calculated based on direct air quality modeling. 
Great care should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions occurring in any 
specific location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission reduction 
programs and therefore represent average co-benefits-per-ton over the entire United States. The 
co-benefits- per-ton for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different than the 
estimates presented here. 
PM2.5 mortality co-benefits are the largest benefit category that we monetized in this 
analysis. To better characterize the uncertainty associated with mortality impacts that are 
estimated to occur in areas with low baseline levels of PM2.5, we included the LML assessment. 
Without policy-specific air quality modeling, we are unable to quantify the shift in exposure 
associated with this specific rule. For this rule, as a surrogate measure of mortality impacts, we 
provide the percentage of the population exposed at each PM2.5 level using the most recent 
modeling available from the recently proposed Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010e). A very large 
proportion of the population is exposed at or above the lowest LML of the cohort studies 
(Figures 5-4 and 5-5), increasing our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. Figure 5-4 shows 
a bar chart of the percentage of the population exposed to various air quality levels in the pre- 
and post-policy policy. Figure 5-5 shows a cumulative distribution function of the same data.  
 5-20

post-policy policy)

(pre- and post-policy policy) 
 
 5-21 
Both figures identify the LML for each of the major cohort studies. As the policy shifts the 
distribution of air quality levels, fewer people are exposed to PM2.5 levels at or above the LML. 
Using the Pope et al. (2002) study, the 85% of the population is exposed to annual mean PM2.5 
levels at or above the LML of 7.5 µg/m3. Using the Laden et al. (2006) study, 40% of the 
population is exposed above the LML of 10 µg/m3. As we model mortality impacts among 
populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are successively lower than the LML of the lowest 
cohort study, our confidence in the results diminishes. However, the analysis above confirms that 
the great majority of the impacts occur at or above the lowest cohort study’s LML. It is important 
to emphasize that we have high confidence in PM2.5-related effects down to the lowest LML of 
the major cohort studies. Just because we have greater confidence in the benefits above the LML, 
this does not mean that we have no confidence that benefits occur below the LML.  
Above we present the estimates of the total monetized co-benefits, based on our 
interpretation of the best available scientific literature and methods and supported by the SAB-
HES and the NAS (NRC, 2002). The co-benefits estimates are subject to a number of 
assumptions and uncertainties. For example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for 
premature mortality, which typically account for at least 90% of the total monetized co-benefits, 
we were able to quantify include the following: 
1. PM2.5 co-benefits were derived through benefit per-ton estimates, which do not reflect 
local variability in population density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health 
incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an over-estimate or under-
estimate of the actual co-benefits of controlling directly emitted fine particulates. 
2. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 
equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 produced via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ 
significantly from direct PM2.5 released from diesel engines and other industrial 
sources, but no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects 
estimates by particle type. 
3. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear down to the 
lowest air quality levels modeled in this analysis. Thus, the estimates include health 
co-benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM2.5, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations. 
4. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 and premature 
mortality (which typically accounts for 85% to 95% of total monetized co-benefits), 
we include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation study in 
addition to our core estimates. Even these multiple characterizations omit the 
uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence rates, populations exposed and 
 5-22 
transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the reported 
confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the 
overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. This information should be interpreted 
within the context of the larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. For more 
information on the uncertainties associated with PM2.5 co-benefits, please consult the 
PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5-5). 
This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 
NAAQS RIA because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring data to run the co-
benefits model. Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics and associated 
estimates of uncertainty using the co-benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of the 
significant differences between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here. 
However, the results of the Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare co-benefits presented 
in Chapter 5 of the PM NAAQS RIA can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding 
the co-benefits results presented in this analysis.

COMPARISON OF CO-BENEFITS AND COSTS 
Using a 3% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized co-benefits of Option 1 of the 
Mercury Chlor Alkali NESHAP to be $22 million to $43 million in the implementation year 
(2013). Using a 7% discount rate, we estimate the total monetized co-benefits of this option to be 
$21 million to $40 million. The annualized social costs of this option HAP are $13 million at a 
7% interest rate.51
Option 2 does not have emission reductions, thus no monetized benefits.  The annualized 
social costs of this option HAP are $25,000 at a 7% interest rate. Thus, the net benefits of this 
option are $-25,000. 
 Thus, the net benefits of this option are $9 million to $30 million at a 3% 
discount rate and $8 million to $27 million at a 7% discount rate. All estimates are in 2007$ for 
the year 2013.  
Table 6-1 shows a summary of the monetized co-benefits, social costs, and net benefits 
for the proposed Mercury Chlor Alkali NESHAP, respectively. Figures 6-1 and 6-2show the full 
range of net benefits estimates (i.e., annual co-benefits minus annualized costs) utilizing the 14 
different PM2.5 mortality functions at discount rates of 3% and 7%. It is important to emphasize 
that these monetized co-benefits do not include the benefits associated with reducing mercury 
emissions. EPA believes that the co-benefits are likely to exceed the costs under this rulemaking 
even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates.

assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are equally potent in causing premature

present value of reduced CO2 emissions is calculated differently than other benefits.  The same discount rate used 
to discount the value of damages from future emissions (SCC at 5, 3, 2.5 percent) is used to calculate net present 
value of SCC for internal consistency.  This table shows monetized CO2 co-benefits at discount rates of 3 and 7 
percent that were calculated using the global average SCC estimate at a 3% discount rate because the interagency 
workgroup on this topic deemed this marginal value to be the central value.  In Section 5, we also provide the 
monetized CO2 co-benefits using discount rates of 5 percent (average), 2.5 percent (average), and 3 percent (95th 
percentile). 
c The annual compliances costs serve as a proxy for the annual social costs of this rule given the lack of difference 
between the two.

DATE:  March 15, 2010 
SUBJECT: Mercury Emission Reductions and Other Mercury Waste Impacts—Conversion 
from Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali to Membrane Cell Chlor Alkali Technology 
The purpose of this memorandum is present the mercury air emission and other mercury 
waste impacts that would result from the conversion of the four mercury cell chlor-alkali plants 
currently operating in the U.S. to non-mercury (membrane cell) technology. These plants are 
ASHTA Chemicals in Ashtabula, Ohio (ASHTA), Olin Corporation in Augusta, Georgia (OLIN-
GA), Olin Corporation in Charleston, Tennessee (OLIN-TN), and PPG in New Martinsville, 
West Virginia (PPG). The first two sections address the baseline mercury air emissions and 
mercury releases to other media. In the event of conversion, these routine releases would be 
eliminated. This is followed by a discussion of the mercury releases and mercury-contaminated 
wastes that would be generated during the cleanup and decommissioning of the mercury cell 
plants. The final section summarizes these air and other media impacts. 
BASELINE MERCURY AIR EMISSIONS 
Table 1 shows the mercury air releases reported in EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory 
(TRI) for 2007 and 2008 for each of the currently operating mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. 
In addition to the TRI information available online, the companies operating these four facilities 
provided emission estimates (which matched the totals in Table 1 reported to TRI) in 
correspondence in the summer of 2009.52,53, 54

Summary of Reported Facility Emissions and Supporting Information 
ASHTA 
As shown in Table 1, ASHTA reported no mercury releases to the air in 2007 and 
0.2 pounds in 2008. In the June 30, 2009 correspondence, ASHTA submitted emission estimates 
for 2007 and 2008. The estimates for 2008 were consistent with those in the 2008 TRI. For 2007, 
ASTA reported 0.12 pounds of point source emissions. Consistent with the TRI, they reported 
“0 (Trace) lbs./yr” fugitive emissions for both 2007 and 2008.  
The EPA section 114 requested documentation for the point source emissions reported in 
the June 30, 2009 correspondence. It also questioned the report that the fugitive emissions are 
zero and requested that ASHTA provide a “precise, substantiated, fugitive emissions estimate.” 
In their February 15, 2010 response ASHTA provided details of the calculation of the 
point source (i.e., stack) emissions. ASHTA conducted emissions tests on their hydrogen and cell 
end box air emission streams in March 2006, and they provided a copy of the report for this

testing. ASHTA using the periodic testing alternative to demonstrate compliance with the 
emission limitation for by-product hydrogen streams and end-box ventilation systems, which 
means that they perform tests three times per week. They use alternative methods for this testing 
which have been approved by EPA. Results for each of the tests conducted in 2007 and 2008 
were provided, along with the 52-week rolling average calculations. 
The calculations show point source mercury emissions of 0.09 pounds in 2007 and 
0.11 pounds in 2008. These estimates are lower than previously reported because the earlier 
estimates included emissions from a noncontact cooling tower and not from the mercury cell 
process. 
ASHTA did not provide any fugitive emission estimates in response to EPA’s request. 
They indicated that, since EPA does not have an approved method for estimating fugitive 
mercury emissions from a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant, they cannot provide emission 
estimates. ASHTA indicated that the zero emissions levels reported were determined from the 
annual mercury balance, the low floor level mercury levels, and the operation of mercury control 
systems. They said that they are “confident that the fugitive emissions collection system installed 
on the cell room removes large amounts of off-process mercury emissions” but they are “unable 
to provide the level of conclusion with any direct measurements.” The EPA estimate of these 
emissions is discussed at the end of this section. 
OLIN 
The mercury emission estimates provided in Olin’s June 25, 2009 correspondence for 
2007 and 2008 were consistent with those reported in the TRI for both their Augusta, Georgia, 
and Charleson, Tennessee facilities. In their February 2, 2010 correspondence, they provided 
documentation for these estimates. 
At both facilities, Olin utilizes continuous mercury emission monitoring systems. These 
units were produced by Mercury Instruments GmbH Analytical Technologies of Germany, and 
are equipped with factory supplied calibration gas generators. Zero calibrations are performed 
every hour the units are in operation as well as span checks at least once per day. These units 
measure and record the mercury concentrations for both the point sources and throughout the cell 
rooms. Stack velocity/flow rates are monitored for the point sources, and cell room flow rates are 
estimates using engineering equations. 
For the point sources, Olin provided daily emission results for each point source, along 
with detailed ten-minute readings for representative days to illustrate how the daily emissions 
 A-5 
were determined. For the fugitive emissions, Olin provided daily measured concentrations, 
estimated flow rates, and emissions. They also provided detailed calculation sheets illustrating 
how the emissions were calculated. 
PPG 
In their July 13, 2009 correspondence, PPG indicated that the mercury stack air releases 
in the TRI include 50 pounds/yr from coal-fired boilers at the site. Therefore, they indicated that 
the 2007 stack emissions from the mercury cell chlor-alkali plant should be 5 pounds for 2007 
and 8 pounds for 2008. The fugitive emission estimates reported in this correspondence were 
consistent with those reported to TRI for 2007 (145 pounds) and 2008 (149 pounds). Therefore, 
PPG’s mercury emissions from mercury cell operations total 150 pounds in 2007 and 157 pounds 
in 2008. 
For their three point sources (Hydrogen De-gas inlet box ventilation system, Chlorine 
De-gas end box ventilation system, and Hydrogen Purification system), PPG operates continuous 
mercury emission monitors to measure the mercury concentration and flow meters to monitor the 
flow rate. In their February 28, 2010 correspondence PPG provided daily average measured 
concentrations, flow rates, and emission rates for 2007 and 2008. They also provided equations 
illustrating the calculations performed. 
PPG also utilizes a continuous mercury monitoring system to measure mercury 
concentration throughout the cell room, and estimates the flow rate from the building based on 
the number of roof exhaust fans operating. They provided average cell room concentrations, flow 
rates, and emission rates for each day in 2007 and 2008. They also provided equations 
illustrating the calculations performed. 
PPG has entered into an agreement with the Attorney General of Maryland regarding 
their West Virginia facility. As part of this agreement, PPG will limit mercury emissions to no 
more than 150 pounds/yr in 2011 and 2012, and no more than 145 pounds/yr in 2013 and 
beyond. Therefore, in 2011 and 2012 there will be around a 2 percent decrease from the average 
2007/2008 levels and around a 6 percent decrease in 2013 and beyond. 
Estimating Fugitive Emissions for ASHTA 
Because ASHTA did not provide data documenting and substantiating their claim of zero 
fugitive emission estimates, we estimated their fugitive emissions since it is not reasonable to 
assume there are no emissions. The approach we used was to develop a fugitive emissions factor 
 A-6 
based on the amount of mercury contained in their cells. Since a previous analysis found little 
correlation between chlorine production and fugitive mercury emissions,58
We developed the emissions factor for fugitive mercury emissions based on the estimated 
amount of mercury in the cells for the other three facilities and used this factor to estimate 
ASHTA’s fugitive mercury emissions. These data are shown in Table 2. The data used to 
calculate the average factor, at approximately 0.5 pounds of fugitive mercury emissions per year 
per ton of mercury in the cells, shows reasonable agreement between the factors developed for 
the three other mercury cell facilities. 
 this other approach 
was not considered viable. 
At ASHTA, there are 24 mercury cells.59
Table 2. Development of Fugitive Mercury Emissions Factor Based on Mercury in Cells 
 Multiplying this number of cells by the average 
factor shown in Table 2 results in an estimated fugitive mercury emission estimate of 62 pounds 
per year for ASHTA. For purposes of estimating the emissions for the whole industry, this value 
was used for both the 2007 and 2008 in this analysis.

BASELINE NONAIR MERCURY RELEASES 
Table 4 shows the nonair mercury releases reported to the TRI for 2007 and 2008. These 
releases include the total amount of mercury released to water or land on or at a facility’s site and 
the amount that is transferred from a facility site to another site and then released to the 
environment via water or land. Attachment 1 includes a detailed analysis of TRI mercury release 
data for these four facilities.

WASTE GENERATION FROM CLEANUP/DECOMMISSIONING 
In addition to the elimination of the routine mercury releases discussed above, there 
would be one-time environmental impacts associated with the clean-up and decommissioning of 
the mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. The discussion and quantification of these impacts are 
discussed below. 
When cell rooms are closed and decommissioned, there will be some loss of mercury to 
the environment. The extent of the loss will be influenced by cell room design and geographic 
location. However, once the cells are shut down, the cell room temperature will decrease, and the 
evaporation rate of any exposed mercury is reduced.62
There is little quantitative information available to estimate the amount of mercury-
containing waste that would need to be disposed of during cleanup/decommissioning. When the 
Borregaard mercury cell chlor-alkali plant in Norway was decommissioned, a large number of 
samples were taken to determine the quantity of mercury-contaminated wastes. The total 
quantity of contaminated waste material was estimated at 1,750 cubic meters, of which around 
55 percent was contaminated process equipment such as steel and rubber-lined steel.
 Therefore, we estimated that there would 
not be measured mercury air emissions during cleanup/decommissioning. 
63
However, information available for the Borregaard plant provided no estimate of the 
mass amount of mercury in the wastes. In order to obtain an estimate of the potential mass, the 
release information in the TRI was examined for closed or converted facilities. There are six 
former mercury chlor-alkali plants in the TRI that have at least five years worth of release data to 
analyze. For each of these facilities, the average air releases during the years prior to the last year 
for which release data were reported in the TRI was compared to the air releases in the last year. 
If those air releases in the last year were less than 50 percent of the average air releases for the 
previous years for which TRI releases were reported, it was assumed that the mercury cell plant 
had ceased operations during that year and was in the process of cleanup/decommissioning. For 
those situations, the ratio of the offsite transfers during that year was calculated to represent an 
estimate of the amount that offsite transfers could increase during cleanup/decommissioning. 
This information is summarized in Table 5.  
 Assuming 
this level of waste is representative, this would mean approximately 7,000 cubic meters of waste 
could be generated during the conversion/closure of the four currently operation U.S. plants.

b Since the air releases in the last reporting year were greater than 50 percent of the average for the previous years, it

cleanup/decommissioning activities. 
In order to estimate the mercury contaminated wastes that would be generated during 
cleanup/decommissioning and transferred offsite for the four currently operating mercury cell 
chlor-alkali plants, the average level of nonair releases for reported for all years of operation are 
multiplied by 253 percent. These estimates are shown in Table 6. 
Therefore, it is estimated that the closure/conversion of the four currently operating 
mercury cell chlor-alkali plants in the U.S. could result in the generation of around 7,000 cubic 
meters of hazardous wastes containing over 6 tons of mercury. Given the unique aspects of each 
mercury cell plants, the extreme paucity of specific data on the wastes generated during mercury 
cell closures/conversions, and the major assumptions in this analysis, there is significant 
uncertainty in these estimates.

SUMMARY 
If the four currently operating mercury cell chlor-alkali plants converted to membrane 
processes, the result would be the elimination of mercury emissions, the elimination of mercury 
releases to the water and other media, and the termination of the creation of mercury-
contaminated wastes from the routine operation of the mercury cells. As discussed above, the 
estimated levels of these routine releases are: 
 Mercury air emissions of between 600 and 800 pounds per year. 
 Nonair mercury releases of between 1,200 and 2,000 pounds per year. 
During the cleanup and decommissioning, there will be mercury-contaminated wastes 
that will be created and that will need to be treated. A rough estimate is approximately 
7,000 cubic meters of waste created during this process that contains over six tons (12,000 lb) of 
mercury.

SUBJECT: Summary of Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Plant Mercury Releases Reported in the 
Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) 
FROM: Phil Norwood, EC/R 
TO:  Dr. Donna Lee Jones, EPA/OAQPS/SPPD/MMG  
The purpose of this memo is to present mercury release information from EPA’s Toxics 
Release Inventory (TRI) (http://www.epa.gov/tri/) from the four currently operating mercury cell 
chlor-alkali plants in the U.S.. These plants are ASHTA Chemicals in Ashtabula, Ohio 
(ASHTA), Olin Corporation in Augusta, Georgia (OLIN-GA), Olin Corporation in Charleston, 
Tennessee (OLIN-TN), and PPG in New Martinsville, West Virginia (PPG). In addition to 
presenting historical release information, the final section presents what are estimated to be 
“typical” annual levels of Nonair mercury releases that would be eliminated in the event that 
these facilities ceased to operate. 
TRI MERCURY RELEASE INFORMATION 
These four mercury cell chlor-alkali plants have been operating since the 1970s. The TRI 
contains mercury release data beginning in 1988. Attachment 1 contains annual release 
information for each of the four plants for the 21 years from 1988 to 2008. Table 1 shows the 
sum of the average annual releases from these four plants for the entire 21-year period, the most 
recent ten years (1999–2008), and the most recent two years (1997 and 1998), and Figure 1 
shows the 21 year trends for total mercury releases for each of the four plants. Table 2 provides 
more detailed plant-specific averages. As can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, Figure 1, and 
Attachment A, mercury releases from these four mercury cell chlor-alkali plants have steadily 
decreased in the 21 year period from 1988 to 2008. 
There appears to be an anomaly in the offsite releases for the PPG facility in 2001 (see 
Figure 1 and Attachment A). In 2001, PPG reported almost 17,000 pounds released offsite 
(While not shown in the table, the specific release reported was attributed to “Offsite 
Landfill/Surface Impoundment). This value is over 12 times higher than the next highest level of 
offsite mercury release for any year in the 10-year period. We believe it is reasonable to assume 
 A-13 
the activities in 2001 that resulted in this large release represent a unique and nonroutine event. 
Therefore, the PPG average release for the period 1999–2008 was calculated excluding the 2001 
values, and a separate total of the plant-specific averages calculated. This was shown in Table 2. 
Therefore, both the 10-year total and the 2007–2008 total Nonair releases were just under 2,000 
pounds per year.

APPENDIX B:  
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED MERCURY CELL 
CHLOR-ALKALI PLANT ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION 
As discussed in Section 3 of the RIA, EPA analysis estimates that electricity 
requirements may be 700 to 1,211 kWh per short ton of chorine lower after conversion, which 
corresponds to a 22% and 37.5% reduction in electricity consumption, respectively.64
Due to transmission and distribution losses, electrical generating units (EGU) supplying 
the electricity grid need to generate more electricity (and emissions) to meet each plant’s 
electricity consumption. EPA has assumed approximately 10% of power is lost during 
transmission and distribution. This factor is commonly used to approximate losses and selected 
using professional judgment. To account for the possible losses and convert consumption 
changes to equivalent electricity generation changes, we divided the kWh consumption 
reductions by 0.9 (electricity generated = electricity consumed / (1-fraction transmission and 
distribution loss)) (Table B-1). Therefore, the total amount of reduced electricity generation 
associated with converting the four existing mercury chlor-alkali plants to membrane cells is 
estimated to be 375 million kilowatt hours per year. Depending on assumed capacity factors, 
this is approximately equivalent to the electricity produced annually by a 40 to 60 megawatt 
power plant.  
 Using the 
range of estimates and plant chlorine capacities, EPA calculated changes in the annual 
electricity consumption for four chlorine plants: OLIN Corporation (facilities in Augusta, GA 
and Charleston, TN), PPG Industries (New Martinsville, WV), and ASHTA Chemicals 
(Ashtabula, OH). This corresponds to a reduction of approximately 350 million kilowatt hours 
per year of reduced electricity consumption associated with converting the four existing 
mercury chlor-alkali plants to membrane cells. 
B.1 Share of Electricity Generation by Fuel Type 
EPA recognizes there are alternative methods for determining electricity generation by 
fuel type (i.e., the fuel mix that produced the electricity). As a result, we have documented the 
results and sources of the information to allow comparisons with the other methods (e.g., use of 
NERC region electricity grid generation statistics by fuel type). EPA’s analysis reviewed the  
                                                 
64 As discussed in Section 3, EPA believes that the 22 percent electricity reduction represents is the best estimate of 
reduced electricity demand, but we provide estimates based on the 37.5 percent electricity reduction to represent the 
data provided by Oceana.

location for the four facilities and used the Homeland Security Information Program (Gold), a 
multiple layer geospatial database, to identify the two closest power plants and companies 
(DHS, 2009).65
B.2 Electricity Generation by Fuel 
 Using physical location information and engineering assessments EPA selected 
a power company that most likely provides the electricity to each plant (Table B-1, Column 2). 
In the case of PPG Industries New Martinsville, WV facility generates 70% of their electricity 
demand. Therefore, EPA assumes only 30% of the plant’s electricity requirements are provided 
by another power company.  
For each power company, the share of electricity generation provided by fuel type is 
reported in Table B-2. EPA collected the latest historical information (2009) from electricity 
provider websites including annual reports66

B.3 Emission Factors 
EPA’s eGRID2007 Version 1.1 provided pollutant emission factors (e.g., short tons per 
kWh) for several pollutants, including NOX, SO2, CO2, and Hg, from EGUs in the U.S. (U.S. 
EPA, 2008).67
                                                 
67 The Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) is a comprehensive inventory of 
environmental attributes of electric power systems. The preeminent source of air emissions data for the electric 
power sector, eGRID is based on available plant-specific data for all U.S. electricity generating plants that 
provide power to the electric grid and report data to the U.S. government. eGRID integrates many different 
federal data sources on power plants and power companies, from three different federal agencies: EPA, the 
Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Emissions 
data from EPA are carefully integrated with generation data from EIA to produce useful values like pounds per 
megawatt-hour (lb/MWh) of emissions, which allows direct comparison of the environmental attributes of 
electricity generation. eGRID also provides aggregated data by state, U.S. total, company, and by three different 
sets of electric grid boundaries. For more information on eGRID, please see 
http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/index.html 
 The emissions data contained within eGRID2007 Version 1.1 represents the year 
2005 and also includes operator, parent company, owner, and electric grid configuration as of 
December 31, 2007. It is the latest version available. eGRID2010 covering year 2007 data is 
expected to be published at the end of 2010. We applied the appropriate conversion factors to 
eGRID2007’s reported power company emissions factors in common units (short tons) 
(Table B-3 and Table B-4). The emissions data contained within eGRID reflect EPA’s Emissions 
Tracking System/Continuous Emissions Monitoring data. The engineering assessment considers the 
emissions factors representative and reasonable for the analysis given the physical location of 
chlorine plants and the power companies and the power companies fuel mix used to meet it 
customer’s electricity requirements.

Emission factors could not be identified for PM2.5, NH3, and VOCs in eGRID. As a 
result, EPA calculated the emission factors using information from two different sources. The 
first source, Co-Benefits Risk Assessment model (COBRA), provided total U.S. emissions 
estimates by fuel type and by pollutant for 2010 (U.S. EPA, 2009).68
The second source, the EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (Table 8), reports electricity 
supply, disposition, prices, and emissions and provides 2010 electricity generation (billion 
kWh) by fuel. EPA calculated emission factors by fuel type by dividing COBRA emissions 
estimates by the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) electricity generation estimates 
(Table B-5) (EIA, 2009).  
 The model contains 
detailed emissions estimates projected for the years 2010 and 2015 that were developed by EPA 
for its 2005 regulatory analysis of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) (U.S. EPA, 2005). 
Emissions data undergoes quality assurance at both the state and federal level. 
                                                 
68 The Co–Benefits Risk Assessment (COBRA) screening model is a stand–alone Windows application that enables 
policy analysts to quickly obtain a first–order approximation of the costs and benefits of different emission 
scenarios and to compare outcomes in terms of changes in ambient particulate matter (PM) concentrations, 
related health effects, and monetary impacts. For more information on COBRA, please see

B.4 Emissions Reductions 
Emission reductions were calculated in three steps. First, we allocate each change in 
electricity generation (Table B-1) by fuel source using the share data (Table B-2). The 
engineering assessment concluded it was reasonable to assume electricity demand declines 
proportionally for all fuel types. In reality, power companies would presumably reduce 
generation at the EGU with the highest average production costs. However, data was not 
available to refine the analysis. Next, we multiplied the generation reduction by fuel by the 
appropriate fuel emission factors (Tables B-3, B-4, B-5). Since the reductions in kWh 
requirements per ton of chlorine is uncertain, EPA considered two scenarios: a 22% reduction 
(Table B-6) and 37% reduction (Table B-7). 
It is important to note that we assume that these emission reductions occur across the 
multiple EGUs associated with the presumed electricity provider. Although we identify the 
location of the mercury chlor alkali plant that would consume less electricity in the tables 
below, those locations do not reflect the location of the emission reductions from the EGUs. 
Because the emission reductions occur across multiple EGUs over a large geographic area, 
these estimates are representative of regional emission reductions.

B.5 Uncertainties 
This appendix provides sufficient documentation to reproduce the calculations of 
emission reductions anticipated to occur as a result of this proposed regulation. In any complex 
analysis, there can be many sources of uncertainty that could affect the results, especially if the 
analysis involves predicting future behaviors. In addition, there are always analytical choices that 
could have incorporated alternate assumptions. Below, we include a qualitative discussion of 
some of the main sources of uncertainty, including the direction and general magnitude of the 
potential bias to the extent feasible given data limitations. 
 B-7 
 There are several uncertainties associated with the estimate of reduced electricity 
demand. As shown in this appendix, assuming a 37.5% reduction as suggested by 
Oceana would nearly double the magnitude of the emission reductions. 
 EPA has assumed a 10 percent transmission and distribution loss factor. In 2007, 
the national average transmission loss was 6.5%, but varied by state (EIA, 2008). 
Using the EIA reported value lowers emission reductions by approximately 2 
percent.  
 The underlying historical data from analyses/models represent different points of 
time (between 2005 and 2010). EPA has assumed they are reasonable 
representations of the analysis year (2013). To our knowledge, forecasts of 
portfolio mixes and emission factors for the analysis year are not readily 
available. Although it is possible that current year or projected data may more 
accurately reflect the regulatory scenario, this analysis is based on the best 
available data.  
 There are a variety of sources of uncertainty implicit within the emissions factors, 
including changes over time. For example, new emissions reduction technologies 
may be introduced earlier than planned and reduce emission factors. Other 
regulations on EGUs may result in lower emissions factors in the future. In 
contrast, higher natural gas prices relative to fuels like coal may change power 
company generation portfolios with higher emission rates. To the extent the 
emissions factors are higher than those used, the current analysis understates 
emissions reductions. In contrast, if the emissions factors are lower, the current 
analysis overstates emissions reductions.  
 Since NOx and SO2 are covered by capped emissions trading programs, we're 
only estimating Pm2.5 emission reductions from reduced electricity demand. 
 The analysis of energy savings assumes that the four facilities all convert rather 
than close. If one or more were to close, the reduction in electricity use would be 
greater at the facility (e.g., rather than a 22% reduction for the process there 
would be a 100% reduction). However, if the facility closing no longer provided 
chlorine and caustic, most of it would be produced elsewhere with an associated 
increase in electricity use in another place. Since this would have to be at a 
facility that uses a process similar to the one the closing facility would have 
converted to, the national electricity savings would be expected to be similar for 
either conversion or closure although the resulting pollution reductions would 
differ spatially. If closure of the process led to closing other processes being 
produced at the same facility, the same reasoning would apply. Therefore, it is 
likely that in the event of closure, the emissions reductions would be similar. 
However if prices increased as a result closure and overall quantities decreased 
then emission reductions would have been underestimated by the amount of 
emissions associated with the reduced production. 
 B-8 
 There are other pre-existing conditions in electricity markets such as taxes and 
imperfect competition and taxes. EPA has only accounted for the externality 
associated with selected pollutant emissions reductions. While these other factors 
may influence benefit-cost analysis, we believe that they are likely to be small 
compared to the health effects associated with the emissions from the pollutants 
considered in the analysis.
