Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Executive Summary ES-1 
Executive Summary  
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead, 
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied 
facilities (COFs).  The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule changes the LRRP program by requiring 
renovators to perform dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation jobs, and requiring them to re-clean and 
re-test for a second subset of renovation jobs if the tests show that lead dust levels exceed the established 
clearance standards.   
Background 
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.  
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure 
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has 
been found to create lead hazards.  Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint, 
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless 
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed. 
The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) and is codified in 
Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The rule was promulgated under the 
authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  The existing LRRP regulations 
require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for compensation in buildings covered 
by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees are trained as either renovators or 
workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based paint.   
Overview of the LRRP Clearance Rule  
Figure ES-1 provides a summary of the dust wipe testing and clearance requirements of the proposed rule, 
and their relationship with the requirements of the 2008 LRRP rule.  The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
would require dust wipe testing on uncarpeted floors and on window sills and troughs after the following 
types of renovations that disturb lead-based paint: removing more than 40 ft2 of trim, molding, cabinets, 
or other fixtures; removing or replacing of window or door frames; scraping 60 ft2 or more of painted 
surfaces; or using a heat gun at temperatures below 1100 degrees Fahrenheit1.  Renovations using 
machines that remove lead-based paint through high speed operation (such as power sanders or abrasive 
blasting), or involving demolition or removal of more than 6 ft2 of plaster walls with lead-based paint 
through destructive means, would require firms to demonstrate – through dust wipe testing – that they 
have met clearance standards before the renovation will be considered complete.  (For interior surfaces, 
the clearance standards are 40 μg/ft2 on floors, 250 μg/ft2 on interior windowsills, and 400 μg/ft2 on 
window troughs.)  If any of the dust wipe test results exceed the interior clearance standards, the firm will 
have to re-clean and re-test the area that failed.  The proposed rule allows renovation firms to stop after 
the second failed clearance test, regardless of the result, if the renovation firm did not agree to refinish the 
surface that is failing clearance as part of the renovation contract.  In such instances, the renovation firm 
would only have to re-clean and test the surface again, no matter what the second dust wipe testing result 
is.  In contrast, the economic analysis assumes that if the second dust wipe testing result fails the 
clearance test, the renovation firm would have to re-clean the surface a second time and test the surface a 
third time.  Therefore, the economic analysis overestimates the cost of the clearance requirement. 
 
                                                     
1 Under the 2008 LRRP rule at 40 CFR 745.85(a)(3)(iii), operating a heat gun on lead-based paint is permitted only at 
temperatures below 1100 degrees Fahrenheit.

lead-based paint through removing trim, molding, cabinets, or other fixtures; removal 
or replacement of window or door frames; scraping painted surfaces; or the use of a 
heat gun. 
 Clearance is required for renovations that disturb lead-based paint through: 
- High-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet; or 
- Plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
 
2. Proposed Rule Threshold Option

a Under the 2008 LRRP rule at 40 CFR 745.85(a)(3)(ii), the use of machines that remove lead-based paint through high speed 
operation such as sanding, grinding, power planing, needle gun, abrasive blasting, or sandblasting, is prohibited unless such 
machines are used with HEPA exhaust control. 
 
Number of Events 
The proposed rule would affect approximately 1.6 million renovations per year.  By comparison, the 
LRRP program applies to 18.7 million renovations each year, of which 7.4 million use lead-safe work 
practices (because they test positive for lead-based paint, and are conducted in compliance with the rule).

Table ES-3 indicates the estimated number of renovation events affected by the different options by type 
of renovation and threshold size.  In about 1.5 million renovations (96% of those affected by the proposed 
rule), dust wipe testing would be required without a requirement to achieve clearance.  The most common

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
single event activities covered by the rule are window or door frame removal, followed by trim, molding, 
or cabinet removal.  But the most common regulated activity overall involves multiple regulated activities 
occurring during the course of a single job (e.g., a renovation with both window frame removal and trim 
removal).

 Executive Summary ES-5 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Executive Summary ES-6 
Renovations requiring clearance make up about 4% of the renovations affected by the proposed rule (and 
1% of all renovations using lead-safe work practices under the LRRP program).  Multiple activity events 
(including combinations of clearance events and dust wipe testing only events) are the most common 
activities requiring clearance, followed by the demolition or removal of plaster through destructive 
means, and using machines that remove paint through high speed operations. 
There are an estimated 1.9 million regulated events per year under the low threshold option and 1.3 
million regulated events per year under the high threshold option.  The distribution of event types under 
these alternate options (in terms of the relative frequency of different single and multiple event activities) 
is similar to the proposed threshold option.  There are an estimated 1.6 million regulated events per year 
under the third party sampling option, the dust wipe testing only option, and the clearance only option, the 
same as under the proposed threshold option. 
Costs of the Proposed Rule  
Dust wipe testing costs are expected to vary according to the number of samples taken, which depend on 
the number of rooms in the work area and whether or not the room is carpeted.  For a typical one-room 
renovation event, four samples would be required (window sill, window trough, workroom floor, and 
adjacent room floor).  For a renovation event where both the renovated room and the adjacent room are 
carpeted, only two samples would be required (window sill and window trough).  Each additional room 
inside the work area will add two to three dust wipes depending on whether or not the room is carpeted 
and whether or not there are windows in the work area.  However samples are not required for more than 
four rooms in a unit’s work area. 
All entities that conduct renovations covered by the proposed Clearance Rule will have to use a trained 
dust sampling technician to take dust samples and have them tested.  (A trained dust sampling technician 
is an individual who has successfully completed a dust sampling technician course accredited by EPA or 
an EPA-authorized State or Tribal program.)  Renovators can either hire a third-party dust sampling 
technician or have themselves or one of their employees trained as a dust sampling technician.  Which 
approach they choose may depend on several factors, including the number of renovations they perform 
each year covered by the proposed rule. 
The average cost for a renovation firm to hire a third-party lead evaluation firm to take the dust wipe 
samples, send them to a lab for testing, and provide a one-page report is estimated to be a fixed cost of 
$158 and a variable cost of $26 per sample.  Thus, the cost to hire a third party to take four dust samples, 
send them to a lab for analysis, and provide a short report is estimated to be $262.  Given that some 
covered renovations take place in more than one room (so that more than four samples may be required, 
depending on whether uncarpeted floors and windows are present), the average cost of the dust testing 
requirement is nearly $300 per job if a third party dust sampling technician is used.  
Firms performing multiple renovations a year where dust wipe testing is required can save money by 
having the renovator or a worker trained as a dust sampling technician.  This requires taking an eight hour 
initial training course (and a four hour refresher course every five years thereafter), at an estimated 
annualized cost of $146 per year.  For renovators that perform multiple covered renovations per year, the 
savings from using their own dust sampling technician are much greater than the annualized cost of the 
dust sampling technician training.  Dust testing for these samples will cost these renovators an average of 
approximately $170 per job (including training costs), a savings of $130 per job compared to using a third 
party dust sampling technician.  The analysis assumes that over 233,000 renovators will choose to 
become trained as dust sampling technicians so that they can collect samples for their own renovations.  
The proposed rule does not require them to become trained, but many renovators may find it more 
economical to do so rather than hiring a third party to take the samples.   
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Executive Summary ES-7 
The cost of dust wipe testing for a job will vary based on the number of surfaces that must be tested, and 
whether the dust sampling is done in-house or by a third-party firm.  Overall, typical costs are estimated 
to vary from $120 to $340 per job.  A typical renovator will have 3 to 38 jobs per year requiring dust wipe 
sampling, with an average of 7 such jobs per year. 
For clearance events (use of a high-speed paint removal machine or demolition or destructive removal of 
over 6 sq. ft. of plaster), renovators would incur similar dust wipe testing costs, in terms of the cost per 
test.  Re-cleaning and re-sampling are only necessary for a subset of events in which a surface fails the 
first round of clearance testing.  In the event of a failed clearance test, only the component(s) that failed 
the tests must be re-cleaned.  For example, if the window sill sample failed clearance but the window 
troughs and the floors passed, the window sill must be re-cleaned but the window troughs and the floors 
do not need to be re-cleaned.  These re-cleaning costs vary from job to job, depending on the number and 
type of components that failed and the size of the space that must be cleaned.  Overall, re-cleaning costs 
are estimated to vary from $43 to up to $5,172 per job, although the costs for a typical job are expected to 
be at the very low end of the range.  (The high end of the range reflects a COF where 14 rooms are 
renovated and where all floor, sill and trough samples fail two rounds of clearance testing and are re-
cleaned twice.  This is an overestimate, since the rule does not require a second re-cleaning or a third 
round of testing.) 
Table ES-4 summarizes the annualized work practice costs by event type for the three different threshold 
options.  This table does not include training costs for renovators who choose to become trained as a dust 
sampling technician, since the training costs are not specific to individual event types.

Benefits 
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of 
medical observation and scientific research.  Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body 
and is toxic to many organ systems.  As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on 
several organ systems.  A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the rule would lead to a reduction in 
these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them.  Young children (from birth through age five) 
are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological development (frequently 
measured by IQ change).   
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and 
expected earnings.  The estimated value of an IQ point is approximately $13,000, which represents the 
present value of a loss in expected lifetime earnings due to a one point IQ drop.  This estimated value of 
an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as additional 
education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels of lead.   
Investigating associations between lead exposure and behavior, mood, and social conduct of children has 
been an emerging area of research.  Early studies indicated linkages between lower-level lead toxicity and 
behavioral problems (e.g., aggression, attentional problems, and hyperactivity) in children.  Blood-lead 
and tooth-lead levels have been associated with behavioral features of attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), including distractibility, poor organization, lack of persistence in completing tasks, and 
daydreaming, in various cohorts of children with a wide range of lead exposures.  The relationship 
between lead exposure and delinquent and criminal behavior also has been addressed in several 
investigations.  Studies linking attention deficits, aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and poor self-
regulation with lead have raised the prospect that early exposure may result in an increased likelihood of 
engaging in antisocial behaviors in later life.  Elevated lead levels have been associated with several 
measures of behavioral disturbance and delinquent behavior. 
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased 
hypertension.   
Both epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead affect 
many different organ systems.  Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are 
among those best substantiated as occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or 
possibly lower); and these categories of effects are currently of greatest public health concern.  Other 
newly demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups are also emerging 
as low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern.  It appears that some of these 
effects, particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's

neurobehavioral development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a 
threshold.   
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would require dust wipe testing after many of the renovation, repair, 
and painting (RRP) activities regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule, and would require clearance after a 
smaller subset of RRP activities.  The clearance requirements of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule are 
expected to result in lower exposures to dust lead by reducing the amount of dust lead left behind after 
RRP activities.  Two types of benefits are expected to be realized from the proposed dust wipe testing 
requirements.  The first type is the direct benefits of the information to the owners and occupants, which 
includes the value of the information on dust lead levels remaining in the renovation work area.  For 
building owners and occupants, this information is likely to improve their understanding and awareness of 
dust lead hazards.  It will also greatly improve their ability to make further risk management decisions.  
This information is particularly critical where dust lead levels approach or exceed the regulatory hazard 
standards.  The second benefit expected to be realized from the proposed dust wipe testing requirements 
stems from changed behavior on the part of renovation firms.  EPA believes that dust wipe testing results 
will also provide valuable feedback to renovation firms on how well they are cleaning up after 
renovations.  It is likely that the specific dust lead levels contained in dust wipe testing results will 
increase renovation firm cleaning efficiency.  Renovation firms will be incentivized to lower the dust lead 
levels remaining after renovation jobs, even if the levels are at or near the regulatory standards.  Because 
proper cleanup plays such a vital role in the minimization of dust lead hazards created by renovations, 
providing information on dust lead levels remaining after renovations to building owners and occupants 
will serve as an incentive for firms to perform post-renovation cleaning efficiently and thoroughly, 
reducing the amount of dust lead left behind after RRP. 
The proposed rule will protect children and adults residing in target housing and attending a COF from 
exposure to lead dust from renovations in a variety of situations.  It will result in fewer homes being 
purchased with pre-existing lead hazards.  It is common for home owners to perform activities that disturb 
paint before selling a house.  The proposed rule decreases the likelihood of lead hazards being present 
when new occupants move into the home.  And the proposed rule will also benefit individuals visiting a 
friend, relative, or caregiver’s house where a renovation has been performed. 
The number of individuals residing in target housing and attending COFs with renovations affected under 
the different options is shown in Table ES-6.  The proposed rule would protect 8.4 million such 
individuals per year, including 809,000 children under the age of 6 and 96,000 pregnant women.  (This is 
important because the transplacental transfer of lead in humans is well documented, and infants are 
generally born with a lead body burden reflecting that of the mother.)  The estimates are limited to 
residents in target housing and children attending COFs, and do not include other groups such as 
individuals who move into housing after a renovation has been performed, or who visit a friend or 
relative’s house.

Small Entity Impacts 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, requires regulators to assess the effects of regulations on small entities 
including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments.  The vast majority of entities in the 
industries affected by the proposed rule are small.   
Two factors are evaluated in analyzing the rule’s impacts on small entities, (1) the number of firms that 
would experience the impact, and (2) the size of the impact.  Average annual compliance costs as a 
percentage of average annual revenues are used to assess the potential average impact of the rule on small 
businesses and small governments.  This ratio is a good measure of entities’ ability to afford the costs 
attributable to a regulatory requirement, because comparing compliance costs to revenues provides a 
reasonable indication of the magnitude of the regulatory burden relative to a commonly available measure 
of economic activity.  Where regulatory costs represent a small fraction of a typical entity’s revenues, the 
financial impacts of the regulation on such entities may be considered as not significant.  For non-profit 
organizations, impacts are measured by comparing rule costs to the organization’s annual expenditures.  
When expenditure data were not available, however, revenue information was used as a proxy for 
expenditures.  It is appropriate to calculate the impact ratios using annualized costs, because these costs 
are more representative of the continuing costs entities face to comply with the rule. 
Table ES-7 presents the total number of small governments, non-profit organizations, and small for-profit 
businesses, and the average cost-to-revenue ratios for each category.  It is estimated that a total of 
approximately 203,000 small entities would be affected by the program, including nearly 203,000 small 
businesses with average impacts of 0.5 percent, about 200 small non-profits with average impacts of 0.1 
percent, and over 100 small governments with average impacts of 0.004 percent.  All of the small entity 
impact calculations assume that the small entities absorb all of the rule’s costs, and that none of the costs 
are passed through to their customers.

The cost of the proposed rule to a typical small entity is estimated to average $1,200 per year, but will 
vary depending on the number of renovation, repair, and painting events undertaken by a small entity in 
the industry sector involved.  As shown in Table ES-8, the average cost impact ranges from about 0.004 
percent to 1.1 percent of revenues, depending on the industry sector.

Table ES-9 provides additional information on potential impacts on small residential construction 
establishments.  Some of the small entities subject to the rule have employees while others are non-
employers.  The non-employers typically perform fewer jobs than firms with employees, and thus have 
lower work practice compliance costs.  However, they also have lower average revenues than entities 
with employees, so their impacts (measured as costs divided by revenues) can be higher.  Impact 
estimates for non-employers should be interpreted with caution, as some non-employers may have issues 
related to understatement of income, which would tend to exaggerate the average impact ratio for this 
class of small entities.  As shown in Table ES-9, there are 151,000 non-employer renovation contractors 
estimated to be affected by the removal of the opt-out provision.  The average cost to these contractors is 
estimated to be $700 each.  This represents 0.7% to 2.6% of reported revenues, depending on the industry 
sector.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 1 1-1 
1. Introduction 
This report presents an economic analysis of alternative regulatory options for revising the lead, 
renovation, repair and painting (LRRP) program regulations for target housing and child occupied 
facilities (COFs).  The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) 
and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The rule was 
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  Section IV of 
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known 
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.    
The existing LRRP regulations require entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for 
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees 
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based 
paint.   
Past use of lead-based paint has resulted in contamination that continues to pose human health hazards.  
While intact lead-based paint is not likely to contribute to such hazards, the deterioration of a structure 
over time or acute environmental stresses, such as are commonly present during renovation activities, has 
been found to create lead hazards.  Since many buildings constructed before 1978 have lead-based paint, 
it is likely that renovation activities in pre-1978 buildings will contribute to lead hazards unless 
appropriate containment and clean-up practices are employed. 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes the following changes to the LRRP program: (1) a 
requirement to perform dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation activities, and (2) a requirement to 
perform dust wipe testing and achieve clearance for a second subset of renovation activities where the 
quantity and characteristics of the dust make it hard to clean up.   
1.1 Purpose of the LRRP Rule Revisions 
The LRRP rule requires certification of entities that perform renovation, repair and/or painting in 
buildings covered by the regulations.  This includes construction contractors (including sole practitioners) 
as well as landlords and other building owners (such as school districts) that may perform RRP activities 
using their own staff.  It does not, however, cover renovation, repair and painting (RRP) work performed 
by homeowners on their own homes.  The certified entity must ensure that all persons performing RRP 
activities on behalf of the entity in buildings covered by the rule are either renovators who have received 
formal training in EPA-approved work practices from an EPA-accredited course or workers who have 
received on-the-job training in these approved work practices.  In addition, the rule requires the use of 
these approved work practices to ensure that proper cleanup has occurred.   
The proposed rule will require renovation firms to perform dust wipe testing after certain types of 
renovation activities and to provide copies of the test results to the owners and occupants of the renovated 
buildings.  These requirements will serve to inform the owners and occupants of the remaining post-
renovation lead-dust levels.  In instances when clearance must be achieved, owners and occupants would 
be provided with the information that the renovated areas met lead-dust level standards after cleaning.  
The increased information provided to owners and occupants of renovated buildings will further protect 
individuals (including children under age 6 and pregnant women), who visit, move into, or live adjacent 
to target housing or COFs renovated under the existing LRRP requirements, from exposure to lead 
hazards due to renovation activities. 
1.2 Goal of the Economic Analysis  
The purpose of this report is to analyze various options for the LRRP rulemaking revisions.  The report 
addresses the requirements for economic analysis of Executive Order 12866 – Regulatory Planning and 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 1 1-2 
Review; the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act (SBRFA); Executive Order 12898 – Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority 
Populations and Low-Income Populations; Executive Order 13045 – Protection of Children from 
Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks; the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; Executive Order 
12875 – Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership; and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). 
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options.  The three primary options considered in 
this analysis only differ in the size thresholds that trigger the rule’s requirements when performing certain 
renovation activities.   Table 1-1 summarizes the options considered in this analysis; they are described in 
more detail below. 
1. Low Threshold Option 
 All event types requiring dust wipe testing where the amount of lead-based paint 
disturbed is larger than 6 square feet.  
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
2. Proposed Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 40 square feet, 
- scraping of paint larger than 60 square feet, 
- heat gun removal of more than 6 square feet 
- Window frame or door frame removal events 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
3. High Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 80 square feet, 
- scraping or heat gun removal of paint larger than 120 square feet, and  
- window frame or door frame removal events. 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 60 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 60 square feet. 
 
There are three alternative options in addition to the three primary options: (1) an option where third party 
dust wipe testing and clearance is required, (2) an option where dust wipe testing is required in lieu of the 
clearance required under the proposed option, (3) an option where clearance is required in lieu of the dust 
wipe testing required under the proposed option.

1.3 Organization of this Report  
Chapter 2 profiles the RRP industry, as well as non-profit and governmental suppliers of childcare 
including family daycare providers. It examines the supply of and demand for renovation, remodeling and 
painting services.   Using data from a variety of sources, including the U.S. Economic Census, the chapter 
discusses the size of the RRP industry and characteristics of its firms, as well as the organizational 
structure and competitiveness of the industry.  The demand for RRP services is characterized and the 
factors that affect demand are discussed.  Other affected industries (e.g. training providers, property 
owners and managers) are also profiled in this chapter. 
Chapter 3 characterizes the lead contamination problem to be addressed under the proposed rule.  It 
discusses how incomplete information and external costs have resulted in inefficient levels of lead 
contamination resulting from renovation activity, and introduces regulation as a reasonable solution for 
these market failures.  The chapter also reviews state and local regulations that affect RRP activities and 
demonstrates that these are not sufficient to address the problem. 
Chapter 4 describes in detail the methods used to calculate costs of the various regulatory options 
considered.  It describes the data sources used and the methodology for estimating the two general 
categories of costs incurred under the proposed rule: dust sampling technician training costs, and dust 
wipe testing and clearance costs. The last section of the chapter estimates the costs of each option over a 
50-year period and presents annualized costs at both 3 percent and 7 percent.

 Chapter 1 1-4 
Chapter 5 describes the benefits of the proposed rule in qualitative terms, including potential benefits to 
adults.  Estimates of the number of children and adults who may experience reduced lead exposures due 
to the dust wipe testing and clearance requirements are also presented.  
Chapter 6 presents findings of distributional analyses relevant to specific rule-making requirements, 
including small business impacts, environmental justice, protection of children and unfunded mandates.

2. Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting Industry Profile 
The LRRP rule for target housing and child occupied facilities (COFs) was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 
21692) and is codified in Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The rule was 
promulgated under the authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  Section IV of 
TSCA was established by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known 
as Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.    
The existing LRRP regulations apply to entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for 
compensation in target housing or child occupied facilities, including building owners or managers who 
use their own staff to conduct RRP activities.  These entities must become certified by EPA, ensure that 
their employees are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when 
disturbing lead-based paint.   
On October 28, 2009, EPA issued a proposed rule to expand the coverage of the 2008 Lead Renovation, 
Repair and Painting Rule. The new rule proposed to eliminate a provision that exempted some housing 
from the rule’s requirement that contractors be trained and certified and use lead-safe work practices 
when renovating, repairing or painting a pre-1978 home.  
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes additional revisions to the LRRP program, including: (1) a 
requirement for dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation activities, and (2) a requirement for dust wipe 
testing and clearance for a subset of renovation activities in which the quantity and characteristics of the 
dust make it difficult to clean up. 
Target housing is defined in section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as any housing 
constructed before 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child 
under age 6 resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0-bedroom dwelling. 
A COF is defined under the rule in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §745.83, as:  
Child-occupied facility means a building, or portion of a building, constructed prior to 1978, 
visited regularly by the same child, under 6 years of age, on at least two different days within any 
week (Sunday through Saturday period), provided that each day’s visit lasts at least 3 hours and 
the combined weekly visits last at least 6 hours, and the combined annual visits last at least 60 
hours. Child-occupied facilities may include, but are not limited to, day care centers, preschools 
and kindergarten classrooms. Child-occupied facilities may be located in target housing or in 
public and commercial buildings. With respect to common areas in public and commercial 
buildings that contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only 
those common areas that are routinely used by children under age 6, such as restrooms and 
cafeterias. Common areas that children under age 6 only pass through, such as hallways, 
stairways, and garages are not included. In addition, for public and commercial buildings that 
contain child-occupied facilities, the child-occupied facility encompasses only the exterior sides 
of the building that are immediately adjacent to the child-occupied facility or the common areas 
routinely used by children under age 6.  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-2 
The term renovation is defined in 40 CFR §745.83 to encompass a wide variety of construction activities: 
Renovation means the modification of any existing structure, or portion thereof, that results in the 
disturbance of painted surfaces, unless that activity is performed as part of an abatement as 
defined by this part (40 CFR § 745.223). The term renovation includes (but is not limited to): the 
removal, modification or repair of painted surfaces or painted components (e.g., modification of 
painted doors, surface restoration, window repair, surface preparation activity (such as sanding, 
scraping, or other such activities that may generate paint dust)); the removal of building 
components (e.g., walls, ceilings, plumbing, windows); weatherization projects (e.g., cutting 
holes in painted surfaces to install blown-in insulation or to gain access to attics, planing 
thresholds to install weather-stripping), and interim controls that disturb painted surfaces. A 
renovation performed for the purpose of converting a building, or part of a building, into target 
housing or a child-occupied facility is a renovation under this subpart. 
Thus, renovation includes repair work as well as painting work involving sanding, scraping, or other paint 
removal.  Renovation activities are conducted without the intent of removing lead, but may disturb it in 
the process.  Lead abatement activities, on the other hand, are conducted with the intent to remove lead-
based paint or otherwise permanently eliminate a lead-based paint hazard.  Depending on the reason they 
are undertaken, many activities, such as replacing windows, can be either renovation or abatement.  
Because the rule will address renovation, rather than abatement activity, this profile characterizes the 
renovation industry as opposed to the abatement services industry. 
The industry profile is categorized into eight sections.  Section 2.1 discusses the supply of contractor-
provided renovation services. Section 2.2 presents information on the numbers and types of child care 
facilities and schools.  Section 2.3 presents information on the number and sizes of non-residential 
property owners and managers likely to be affected by the rule.   Section 2.4 focuses on the demand-side 
of renovation by identifying the quantity of renovation activities performed. Section 2.5 discusses the 
overall market organization for the renovation industry.  Section 2.6 describes the residential property 
owner and manager industry. Section 2.7 discusses training providers.  Section 2.8 provides an overview 
of the structures that would be affected by the revisions to the LRRP rule.   
2.1 Contractors that Supply Renovation Services 
Data from the U.S. Economic Census were used to identify the North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) industry groups that may provide renovation, repair and painting work (U.S. Census 
Bureau 2004a).  An establishment is assigned to a NAICS group based on the activities from which it 
derives the greatest share of its revenues.  These activities may or may not make up the majority of work 
(i.e. labor hours) performed by the establishment, which may also be involved in a variety of other related 
(or unrelated) lines of work.  The analysis identified 8 NAICS codes that are likely to include the vast 
majority of construction-related establishments that will be affected by the rule.  Affected industry groups 
include two building construction sectors (NAICS 236118 – Residential Remodelers; and NAICS 236220 
– Commercial and Institutional Building Construction) and six specialty trade contractor sectors.  
The number of contracting establishments affected is also discussed in Chapter 4.  This profile examines 
the financial and employment characteristics of construction establishments likely to provide renovation 
work in child-occupied facilities.   
NAICS sectors likely to perform projects regulated under the LRRP rule, as well as examples of the work 
they perform, are presented in Table 2-1.

2.1.1 Number of Establishments with Employees 
The U.S. Economic Census tracks businesses with paid employees (employer establishments) and non-
employer establishments (self-employed contractors) separately.1  This discussion deals with employer 
establishments only; non-employers are addressed in the next section. 
Table 2-2 presents both the number of establishments and the number of employees in each NAICS group 
of interest.  The number of establishments “includes all establishments that were in business at any time 
during the year are included.  Construction establishments that were inactive or idle for the entire year 
were not included” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006a).  Table 2-2 also presents the average per-establishment 
employment numbers by NAICS code.  The average employment numbers are small for all affected 
sectors.  Overall, Commercial Building Construction contractors have the largest number of employees 
per establishment (19.2 people), while Residential Remodelers have the smallest (3.9 people).

Table 2-3 presents the total number of employees and the number of construction workers in each 
identified industry.  The number of employees “includes all full-time and part-time individuals on the 
payrolls of construction establishments during any part of the pay period which included the 12th of 
March, May, August, and November” (U.S. Census Bureau 2005m).  The number of construction 
workers “includes all payroll workers (up through the working supervisory level) directly engaged in 
construction operations, such as painters, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians… journeymen, 
mechanics…truck drivers and helpers.”  Non-construction employees include “payroll employees in 
executive, purchasing, accounting, …and routine office functions” (U.S. Census Bureau 2005m).  
Because construction workers form the vast majority of the people who require training under the rule, 
their role in the composition of each sector’s labor force provides an indication of the extent to which 
each sector will be affected by the regulations. 
In total, about 3.6 million people work for the 372,623 establishments in the potentially affected 
industries.  About 74 percent of these employees are construction workers.  The affected sectors differ in 
terms of the composition of their labor force.  For example, construction workers make up 84 percent of

employees in the Drywall and Insulation contractor sector.  In the Residential Remodelers sector, 
however, construction workers make up only 65 percent of the labor force (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c).

2.1.2 Number of Non-Employer Establishments 
As mentioned above, the U.S. Economic Census tracks non-employer establishments separately from 
establishments with employees.  Data on the number of non-employer establishments were available from 
the U.S. Small Business Administration.  A non-employer firm “is defined as one that has no paid 
employees, has annual business receipts of $1,000 or more ($1 or more in the construction industries), 
and is subject to federal income taxes” (U.S. Small Business Administration 2006a).  Essentially, non-
employers are self-employed contractors.  Because little financial and operational data is available for 
non-employers, the vast majority of this profile focuses on establishments with employees.  This 
subsection discusses the number of non-employers in the affected industry sectors and the receipts of 
these establishments.  
The U.S. Small Business Administration did not provide data on the number or revenues of non-employer 
establishments in each of the 6-digit level NAICS industries addressed in this profile.  Data on the 
number of such establishments was available for Plumbing and HVAC contractors (NAICS 238220) and 
Electrical contractors (NAICS 238210) only; for the remaining industries, data was provided at the more 
general 4-digit NAICS level.  In total, there are over 1 million self-employed contractors. 
To estimate the number of non-employer establishments in each of the 6-digit sectors, it was assumed that 
the distribution of non-employer establishments in each 4-digit NAICS code is the same as the 
distribution of establishments with payroll in the same 4-digit group.  Similarly, to estimate the revenues 
of these establishments, it was assumed that the distribution of receipts in each 4-digit NAICS code is the 
same as the distribution of revenues of payroll establishments in the same 4-digit industry.  
Table 2-4 presents the estimated number and revenues of non-employer establishments in each of the 8 
sectors affected by the rule.

2.1.3 Financial Profile 
In this section, Census data is used to examine key financial indicators for the renovation industry.  The 
indicators include net value of construction (value of construction less value of construction 
subcontracted out to others) and labor costs.  Net value of construction work is used instead of the total 
value of construction work because it is a measure of the work actually performed by the establishment.  
Table 2-5 presents the average per establishment net value of construction work (NVCW) for each 
industry sector.  The table also presents labor costs as a percent of the net value of construction for each 
of the affected NAICS codes.

Table 2-5 shows the wide range of values of construction work per establishment across all NAICS codes 
of interest.  The average establishment in the Residential Remodeler industry (NAICS 236118) has the 
smallest net value of construction work ($370,000), followed by the Finish Carpentry contractors industry 
 Chapter 2 2-6 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-7 
($446,000).  Meanwhile, the average establishment in the Commercial Building Construction industry 
(NAICS 236220) has the largest net value of construction value ($2,909,000), with the Drywall and 
Insulation contractors industry netting the second largest value ($1,380,000).  It should come as no 
surprise that the Commercial Building Construction industry’s net value of construction is so much larger 
than the Residential Remodeler industry’s net value of construction work given that commercial building 
construction projects tend to be substantially larger in scope and size than residential remodeling projects.  
As demonstrated in Table 2-5, while labor constitutes about 33% of net value of construction for all the 
industry sectors, the composition varies across industry sectors.  The Painting and Wall Covering 
contractor (NAICS 238220) industry is most dependent on labor, with an overall labor cost to net value of 
construction ratio of 39 percent.  The Commercial Building Construction industry, with an overall labor 
cost to net value of construction work ratio of 27 percent, is the least dependent of the 12 sectors (U.S. 
Census Bureau 2005c).  It is worth mentioning that labor (as measured by payroll) is a relatively small 
percentage (27% to 39%) of total net value, reflecting the fact that a large percent of revenues go to 
covering the cost of materials and profit. 
2.1.3.1 Establishment Size by Revenue Bracket 
The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business in both the Residential Remodeler 
and Commercial Building Construction industries as one that has revenues of $33.5 million dollars a year 
or less.  The small business definition for the ten specialty contractor industries is $14 million per year 
(U.S. Small Business Administration 2008).  The SBA size standards apply to firms rather than 
establishments; at the time the analysis was performed, revenue data in the 2002 Economic Census was 
only available at the establishment level.  Since a firm may consist of one establishment, a few 
establishments or even a very large number of establishments, by using establishment rather than firm 
data, this analysis overestimates the number of small businesses in the affected industry. 
The remainder of this section examines the number of establishments, number of employees, net value of 
construction work and value of business done2 distributed by establishment revenue bracket.  These data 
were available from the 2002 Economic Census at the NAICS code level only.  Establishments were 
classified into two revenue categories based on the total value of business done – those with revenues less 
that $10 million and those with revenues greater than $10 million.  Because the Census groups all 
establishments with revenues of $10 million or more into one revenue bracket, it is not possible to 
determine what percentage of Residential Remodeler nor Commercial Building Construction 
establishments have revenues of less than $33.5 million.  Note, however, that nearly 100 percent of 
Residential Remodeler establishments have revenues of less than $10 million per year.  The same cannot 
be said for Commercial Building Construction establishments, as 12 percent have revenues greater than 
$10 million per year.  The percent of establishments, employees and net value of construction contributed 
by establishments in each revenue bracket is presented in Table 2-6. 
 
                                                     
2 Value of business done is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as including “the sum of value of construction work 
and other business receipts.  Value of business done is the sum of receipts, billings, or sales from establishments of 
construction business activities plus receipts from other business activities”  (U.S. Census Bureau 2004d).

The distribution of the number of establishments for all eight NAICS codes is greatly skewed toward 
smaller establishments.  In four out of eight industry sectors, over 99.5 percent of establishments have 
revenues below $10 million.  For the remaining sectors, establishments with revenues greater than $10 
million make up less than 5 percent of establishments in any sector (with the exception of the Commercial 
Building Construction industry where 12% of establishments earn more than $10 million in revenues3).  
Thus, about 98 percent of all establishments in the affected industries have revenues well below the SBA 
definition of small business.  
Establishments with revenues of less than $10 million account for between 41 and 95 percent of total 
employment for each sector, and about 68 percent of employment overall.  The distribution of the net 
                                                     
3 Once again, this difference arises because of the larger size of a majority of Commercial building construction 
projects.  Regardless, if only 12% earn revenues greater than $10 million, it can easily be assumed that a much 
smaller percentage of establishments in this industry earn revenues greater than the SBA cutoff of $33.5 
million. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-9 
value of construction work and the total value of business done is skewed toward smaller establishments 
in a manner similar to the distribution of employees.  Establishments with revenues of less than $10 
million account for between 30 and 92 percent of the net value of construction work and between 24 and 
91 percent of the total value of business done in each sector.  It is worth mentioning that if the 
Commercial Building Construction industry is removed, the lows in the previously cited categories jump 
to 55 percent.  Overall (across all industry sectors) small businesses contribute about 60 percent of the net 
value of construction work and 60 percent of the total value of business (U.S. Census Bureau 
2004c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m; U.S. Census Bureau 2005m). 
2.1.3.2 Labor and Material Costs as a Percentage of Total Value of Business Done 
In order to better understand the potential impacts of the rule on the affected industries, and particularly 
on small businesses, it is important to observe whether establishment costs as a percentage of the total 
establishments’ total revenues differ for small and large establishments.  Figure 2-1 examines labor and 
material costs, as well as the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of the total value 
of business done for the twelve affected sectors.  While the rule will increase the cost of material slightly, 
the major impact will be on labor costs, including the training of staff. Each of the sectors was broken 
down into two size categories by revenue bracket: less than $10 million and $10 million and more.  The 
cost of labor, of materials, and of construction work subcontracted out was summed across the 12 industry 
sectors for large and for small establishments.  These values were then compared to their total value of 
business. 
Labor costs, material costs, and the cost of construction work subcontracted out as a percentage of total 
value of business done are presented in Figure 2-1.  Regardless of size of establishments, material costs 
tend to be a slightly larger percentage of total revenues than do labor costs.  Labor costs make up about 25 
percent of revenues for small establishments and about 16 percent for large establishments.  Based on 
Census data, large establishments subcontract out a much larger percentage of their work than do small 
businesses.

2.2 Child Care and Schools: Child Occupied Facilities  
For the purposes of analysis, COFs are divided into the following categories4: 
 Kindergartens and Pre-Kindergartens in Schools: Located in public and private schools; 
 Daycare centers: Organized (licensed) facilities located in public and commercial buildings;  
 Family daycare: Organized (licensed) daycare facilities located in the provider’s home; and 
 Informal daycare: Informal (i.e. not licensed) day care providers, including relatives and non-
relatives. Some of these providers may be paid for their services. 
There is a great deal of diversity and complexity in the childcare industry.  The formal childcare sector 
consists primarily of two types of facilities – center-based care and family daycare.  Daycare centers are 
typically located in commercial or educational buildings, including schools and university campuses.  
They include private for-profit and non-profit facilities that can operate as independent centers or as part 
of chains.  For-profit facilities can be found in office buildings, factories, other workplace settings, or in 
stand-alone facilities.  Non-profit facilities may be found in YMCAs or other community centers, 
churches, college and university campuses, as well as in office or stand-alone buildings.  Government 
                                                     
4 The analysis is limited to kindergartens, pre-schools, daycare centers, family daycare, and informal daycare.  Due 
to a lack of data, it does not include other facilities that may qualify as COFs under the rule. 
 Chapter 2 2-10 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-11 
education and human services agencies also provide daycare through programs such as Head Start, as 
well as through kindergarten and pre-kindergarten programs at local schools.  
Unlike center-based care, family daycare is typically offered in the home of the caregiver.  Family 
daycare facilities tend to serve smaller groups of children and have a smaller child-to-caregiver ratio 
(KeepKidsHealthy 2001).  In addition to formal care provided by daycare centers, schools, and family 
daycare, children may also be cared for informally by relatives, family friends, or other acquaintances.  
Informal care may be paid or unpaid, and usually takes place at the home of either the child or the 
provider.   
Table 2-7 summarizes the types and numbers of facilities and childcare providers in this universe, 
grouping them by the age of their construction.   It shows that the rule would apply to 1,656,000 child-
occupied facilities, of which 1,559,000 are in target housing.

2.2.1 Daycare Centers and Family Daycare 
Establishments involved in the provision of day care of infants or children are classified under NAICS 
624410 – Child Day Care Services.  This industry covers child day care centers (including those located 
in the provider’s home), pre-school centers, nursery schools and pre-kindergarten centers (except as part 
of elementary schools).  In 2002, Census reported that this industry included over 55,000 firms that 
employed nearly 752,000 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005d).  Furthermore, Census reports 618,947 
non-employers in the industry (U.S. Census Bureau 2005k).  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-12 
While Census covers both family and center-based childcare under NAICS 624410, there is reason to 
believe that Census undercounts the number of employer firms in this industry. This is likely to occur for 
two reasons. First, it is likely that the number of firms reported by Census primarily includes centers, 
since care provided solely by one person (as occurs at many family daycare establishments) would be 
classified under non-employer statistics.  Second, Census classifies a business into NAICS 624410 if its 
primary line of business is the provision of child day care services; it is likely that many facilities have 
alternate primary lines of business (YMCAs and churches, for example).  The number of non-employers, 
on the other hand, is likely to include care providers such as nannies or babysitters that do not constitute 
formal care, but that cannot be disentangled from the total count.    
In light of the limitations of the Census data, an alternative data source is used for this analysis. In 2005, 
the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) in conjunction with the National 
Childcare Information Center (NCCIC) conducted a study on the number and licensed capacity of daycare 
centers and family daycare establishments in the 50 U.S. states.  Based on these data, there are 
approximately 115,000 licensed daycare centers in the United States.  Because licensing requirements 
differ from state to state, this count includes 105,444 facilities licensed as daycare centers, as well as 
about 10,000 facilities such as Head Start, religious daycare, and other similar establishments, which are 
required to obtain a license in some states, but must only be registered or certified in others.   
According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) First National Health Survey 
of Childcare Centers, about 22 percent of licensed daycare centers are located in elementary schools.  
Since throughout this analysis, schools are analyzed separately from daycare centers, the number of 
daycare centers was reduced by 22 percent, bringing the total number of centers to 89,260. According to 
NCES data on public and private schools, however, an additional 1,421 schools without kindergartens 
have a pre-kindergarten program (See Section 2.2.2.1).  These 1,421 centers are also excluded from the 
total center counts to avoid double-counting, bringing the number of centers to 87,840. 
In addition to the 115,000 centers, NARA reported a total of 166,514 licensed small family childcare 
homes and 47,452 large family childcare homes.5 With the addition of about 16,000 family daycare 
homes that are reported as certified, not licensed, NARA reports a total of 229,875 family daycare 
facilities.  
Because some states either completely exempt family daycare with fewer than a certain number of 
students from licensing requirements, or offer voluntary registration, the family daycare numbers reported 
by NARA are likely to underestimate the total family daycare universe.  As such, to estimate the number 
of family daycares, this analysis relied on a 2002 report by the Center for the Childcare Workforce, which 
provides data on family childcare providers caring for unrelated children in their own homes.  Based on 
these data, it is estimated that there are a total of 591,071 family daycare facilities in the United States. 
Table 2-8 summarizes the size of the formal (center and family daycare) childcare universe.

Figure 2-2 plots changes in the numbers of licensed child-occupied facilities between 1995 and 2004 
using information compiled from the Childcare Licensing Studies published annually by the Children’s 
Foundation and the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA).6  These data give larger 
counts than the data above because they include facilities in Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.7  
But the trends displayed in this data are likely to be present in the smaller data set.  The number of 
licensed Childcare Centers has grown gradually over time, from 92,000 in 1995 to 120,000 facilities in 
2004.  The number of Large/Group Family Childcare Homes grew in a similar manner, before tapering 
off in 2004.  Over the time period specified, the number of Small Family Childcare Homes declined from 
276,000 to 256,000, while exhibiting much more variation from year to year than the other two 
categories.  Here, as noted earlier, large and small refer to the number of children enrolled, not the SBA 
definition of a large or small entity. 
                                                     
6 When the Children’s Foundation closed in 2005, NARA assumed sole responsibility for collecting licensing 
information through the annual study.  However, because the methodology was altered with the new leadership, 
data from the 2005 Childcare Licensing Study were not included into . Figure 2-2
7 While the rule would apply to Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands, they are not included in this analysis for 
reasons of consistency since some of the major data sources used elsewhere in the analysis were limited to the 
50 states and the District of Columbia.  Holding all other things equal, by not including COFs in Puerto Rico, 
Guam, and the Virgin Islands, the analysis underestimates the costs and benefits of the rule.

The market for lead-safe renovation activities in COFs is dependent on the number of care providing 
facilities.  Figure 2-2 indicates that while there have been some fluctuations in the underlying components 
of the overall market, when considered over the entire time frame, the number of licensed COFs has been 
relatively stable.   
While there wasn’t significant growth in childcare over the 1995-2004 timeframe, a study forecasts 
growth in the demand for childcare labor.  Fueling the future demand for childcare services is the 
expected increase in the amount of children below 5 between 2004 and 2014.  Adding to this growing 
demand will be an increased female labor force participation rate, forcing families to find alternate care 
options for their children.  Furthermore, many states will be implementing their own care programs for 3- 
and 4- year old children in the coming years.  The government also plans to increase subsidies for low-
income families attending day care programs (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2005).  While trends point to 
increased demand for childcare labor, it is difficult to assess whether this will be accompanied by an 
increase in the number of facilities, and to what extent these new facilities will be located in pre-1978 
buildings. 
2.2.1.2 Informal Daycare  
Informal daycare is provided by unlicensed providers, including relatives, friends, and others.  
Calculations determining the number of informal daycare providers are based on figures and percentages 
found in a report on the number of paid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare entitled 
“Estimating the Size Components of the U.S. Childcare Workforce and Caregiving Population: Key 
Findings from the Childcare Workforce Estimate” (Center for Childcare Work Force 2002).

Target Housing COFs 
Family daycare and informal daycare take place in target housing.  Renovation events in some target 
housing COFs would be regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule regardless of their status as a COF; for 
example, if they are owner-occupied units where a child under the age of six or a pregnant woman resides 
or if they are rental units.  For a detailed explanation of the methodology used to estimate the number of 
target housing COFs, please see Section 4.2 of EPA (2009). Section 2.8 presents the estimated numbers 
of target housing COFs affected by the rule. 
2.2.2 Public and Private Schools 
This section describes the number and size of public and private schools with kindergartens and pre-
kindergartens.   
2.2.2.1  Number of Schools 
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the 2004-2005 academic year, there 
were 93,295 public schools with students in the United States.  In total, these schools served 48.8 million 
students (NCES 2006a).  The rule will apply only to those portions of schools that meet the COF 
definition.  Thus, the rule is expected to primarily impact schools that have kindergarten or pre-
kindergarten programs.  According to the NCES’s Public Elementary and Secondary School Universe 
Survey, which collects data on all operational public schools in the United States, in 2004-2005, 52,129 
of the 93,295 U.S. public schools (roughly 56 percent) provided either pre-kindergarten or kindergarten 
services.8  Of these 52,129 schools, 20,885 offered both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and 29,884 
schools provided kindergarten services only.  Only 1,400 schools offered pre-kindergarten, but not 
kindergarten services; this group of schools includes standalone preschools operated by local school 
boards, as well as daycare centers located in public middle schools, high schools, and ungraded schools 
(See Table 2-9).  Note that these figures are not limited to schools with pre-1978 buildings.

As shown in Table 2-10, in 2004-2005 a total of 990,421 pre-kindergartners and 3,543,554 kindergartners 
were enrolled in pre-kindergartens and kindergartens offered at public schools, respectively.  Given the 
number of programs described above, this means that there are roughly 44 pre-kindergarten students per 
school and 70 kindergarten students per school. 
                                                     
8 A school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero 
students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment data were 
not provided.  Similarly, a school was considered as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten enrollment was 
greater than zero, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten or kindergarten, 
but did not report kindergarten enrollment.

Number of Public School Districts 
Public schools in the United States are operated by local education agencies (LEAs), organizations 
“responsible for providing free public elementary/secondary instruction or education support services.”  
The National Center for Education Statistics collects data on LEAs through its Common Core of Data 
(CCD) fiscal and non-fiscal surveys.  NCES designed the Common Core of Data system to 
“accommodate the many and varied organizational structures used in the provision of public elementary 
and secondary education.”  As such the CCD contains records that represent “administrative and 
operating units that are unlike typical public schools and school districts – for example, regional 
administrative service centers without students.”   
According to the CCD Local Education Agency Universe Survey, in 2004-2005, 17,647 LEAs operated 
in the 50 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.  Of these 17,647 agencies, 14,473 operated at 
least one school that offered pre-kindergarten or kindergarten services and may thus be affected by the 
rule.   
Of the 14,473 local education agencies responsible for schools with pre-kindergarten and kindergarten 
programs, just under 13,200 are typical public school districts (usually county or town agencies 
responsible for providing education services in that location).  An additional 949 agencies are charter 
school organizations.  The remaining 333 agencies represent regional, state, and federal institutions, as 
well as supervisory union administrative centers.9  Table 2-11 presents a detailed breakdown of the 
number of education agencies by agency type, as well as counts of schools with pre-kindergartens and/or 
kindergartens operated by each agency.

The NCES collects data on the revenues and expenditures of local education agencies through its CCD 
School District Finance Survey.  Table 2-12 presents the total revenues, average revenues, and percent 
revenues derived from federal, state, and local funds for education agencies operating schools with pre-
kindergarten and/or or kindergarten programs.  All figures are based only on agencies with available data; 
for each agency type, the table indicates the percent of LEAs represented in the totals.  Note that financial

Table 2-13 presents the total and average expenditures of local education agencies.  Total expenditures 
are composed of total current expenditures for elementary/secondary education, as well as other 
expenditures.  Elementary/secondary education current expenditures include expenditures for instruction 
(e.g. teacher salaries), support services (including, but not limited to, administrative, maintenance, and 
operations costs), and other expenses, such as transportation and food services.  Other expenditures 
include spending not related to elementary/secondary education, such as expenditures for community 
service, or adult education, capital outlay expenditures, payments to other government and educational 
entities, and debt interest payments.  In Table 2-13 current expenditures are split out by type, while the 
remainder (capital and non-educational) are combined and labeled as “all other” expenditures.

For most LEAs, the majority of expenditures (51 percent on average, across all LEAs) are spent on 
instruction.  In aggregate, the category containing maintenance costs (i.e. support service) makes up 
around one-third of all expenditures.  Lastly, the “all other” expenditures category makes up a significant 
percentage of the expenditures for regional education services agencies. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, public school districts are considered large if they serve a 
population of more than 50,000.  Table 2-14 presents the number of LEAs that operate schools that have 
pre-kindergartens and/or kindergartens, by agency type and the size of the population served.

Private schools 
In 2003-2004, the National Center for Education Statistics conducted a survey of private schools in the 
United States.  NCES’s Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States: Results From the 2003-
2004 Private School Universe Survey (2006) presents a summary of survey results, including numbers of 
schools currently in operation, the number of students enrolled, and teachers employed.  Table 2-15 
presents summary statistics on national private schools, including a total count of all private schools, 
enrollment and teachers, as presented in NCES’s report.

According to the NCES data, in 2003-2004 there were 34,681 private schools in the U.S., enrolling a total 
of just over 5.2 million students, with a total teaching staff of over 441,000.  On average, there were 150 
students enrolled in a private school and 13 teachers per school. These figures must be interpreted with 
caution however, since they encompass elementary schools, secondary schools, etc. which, by definition, 
include different numbers of classes. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-21 
While the NCES report provides some data on the number of private schools by grade level, it does not 
provide data on grades offered by each individual school in the survey. In order to identify schools with 
kindergartens only, pre-kindergartens and kindergartens, and pre-kindergartens only, this analysis relied 
on the Excel database underlying NCES’s 2003-2004 report.  This database, which contains records for 
29,907 of the estimated 34,461 private schools in the United States, specifies the highest and lowest grade 
offered at each school, as well as the number of students enrolled in each grade.  The database, however, 
does not include sampling weights used to adjust some of the survey results to generate final numbers 
presented in NCES’s report.  In order to most accurately estimate the number of schools offering each 
combination of kindergarten or pre-kindergarten programs, as well as the number of children enrolled in 
these programs, this analysis:  
¾ used the underlying database to identify schools with pre-kindergartens only, kindergartens only, 
and both kindergartens and pre-kindergartens, then 
¾ inflated these counts to account for the 4,500 schools that were not included in the database.  The 
numbers of schools offering each combination of programs was inflated using the ratio of the 
number of schools presented in the published report to the number of schools included in the 
database.  Similarly, the number of children in each school setting, estimated based on the 
underlying data, was adjusted using the ratio of the number of kindergartners presented in the 
published report to the number of kindergartners reported in the database.10    
Table 2-16 breaks down the totals from the previous table to provide a count of the number of private 
schools with pre-kindergartens and/or kindergartens.

Of the 34,681 private schools counted in the 2003-2004 survey, 26,531 provided either pre-kindergarten 
or kindergarten services.11  Furthermore, of these 26,531 private schools, 19,305 provided both pre-
kindergarten and kindergarten services.  Only 21 private schools provided pre-kindergarten but not 
                                                     
10 In its report, NCES tracks schools where kindergarten is the highest grade offered separately from regular 
elementary, middle and high schools.  As such, when inflating counts obtained from underlying data, the 
analysis calculated two sets of ratios for the numbers of schools and numbers of children enrolled – one for 
regular, and another for kindergarten-terminal schools.   
11 A private school was identified as having a pre-kindergarten or kindergarten in the same fashion as a public school 
was in Section 2.2.1.

services.  Note that these figures are not limited to schools in pre-1978 buildings. 
Table 2-17 presents a count of the number of pre-kindergarten and kindergarten students served in private 
schools, as well as the average number of students served per school.

According to Table 2-17, there are 26,510 private schools with kindergartens, enrolling a total of 555,531 
kindergarteners.  Also, there are 19,326 private schools with pre-kindergartens, enrolling 863,542 pre-
kindergarten students.  The average number of private pre-kindergarten students per school (45) is more 
than double the average number of kindergarten students (21).  Whereas public schools displayed nearly 
the opposite ratio with on average 44 pre-kindergarten students and 70 kindergarten students per school. 
Non-profit organizations, including private schools, are defined as small under the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act if they are independently owned and operated and not dominant in their field.  While determining 
whether a school meets this definition is difficult, it is useful to present some statistics describing the size 
distribution of private schools.  Table 2-18 shows the distribution of private schools by the number of 
students they serve.  This represents the total number of students served, and not just the number of 
kindergarten and pre-kindergarten students.

a.  Includes all schools with missing total student data.  These schools are assumed to have student enrollment 
equal to the average school with over 100 students, or 285.

The distribution of private schools in the U.S. is heavily skewed toward smaller schools, with 94% of 
private schools serving less than 500 students and 99% of private schools serving less than 1000 students.  
                                                     
12 Beginning in 1995, the definition of school employed by the Private School Survey was expanded to include 
schools whose highest grade was kindergarten.  Therefore, these statistics are likely to include some pre-
kindergartens that are more likely also classified as preschools in other sources (NCES 2006e).  Later sections 
explain how the calculations avoid double-counting. However, because this is a small figure, it is almost 
negligible.

However, these data do not indicate whether the schools are affiliated with or part of a larger 
organization.  
2.3 Nonresidential Commercial Property Owners and Managers 
Nonresidential commercial property owners and managers will be affected by the rule if they rent space to 
daycare facilities or other COFs in buildings constructed prior to 1978.  The number and size of firms in 
this industry is described below.   
2.3.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics 
Firms involved in the leasing of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses) are classified under 
NAICS 531120 – Lessors of nonresidential buildings (except Miniwarehouses).  In 2002, this industry 
included 28,426 firms that employed 154,725 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).  
Firms involved in the management of non-residential properties are classified under NAICS 531312 – 
Nonresidential property managers. In 2002, this industry included 10,506 firms that employed 125,616 
people (U.S. Census Bureau 2005b).13  Table 2-19 includes only firms with employees.  The U.S. Census 
Bureau does not differentiate between self-employed individuals that lease or manage commercial real 
estate as opposed to residential buildings.  This analysis assumes that non-employers primarily lease 
residential buildings, rather than commercial property.  As such, non-employer establishments are not 
included in this profile, or in the remainder of the analysis.

The 2008 LRRP rule economic analysis (EPA 2008) indicated that a total of 17,705 daycare centers rent 
space in pre-1978 buildings. Because daycare centers are only one of many types of establishments 
renting non-residential space, and because the rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to 
1978, the analysis also assumes that each property manager or lessor firm owns only one regulated 
building.  As such, the number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of daycare 
centers renting space, or 17,705.   
2.3.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment  
The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in 
NAICS 531120 must have revenues of less than $7 million, while firms in NAICS 531312 must have 
revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration 2008).  Average revenues in these 
NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-20).

Census data are not specific enough to report revenues at either the $7 million dollar or $2 million dollar 
cutoff; Table 2-21 presents the percent of firms in NAICS 531120 and NAICS 531312 that have revenues 
below $5 million and $1 million respectively.  Consequently, the figures in Table 2-21 are all 
underestimates of the true percentages of firms that qualify as small businesses.

Based on 2002 data, 96 percent of NAICS 531120 firms and 81 percent of NAICS 531312 firms have 
revenues below $5 million and $1 million, respectively.  In the Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings 
industry, these firms contribute 32 percent of the industry revenues while employing 73 percent of the 
workforce.  The revenue and employment distribution is more skewed in the Nonresidential Property 
Managers sector.  Small firms in this industry contribute only 19 percent of the revenues, while 
employing only 26 percent of the workforce. 
2.4 The Demand for Renovation Services 
The demand for renovation is responsive to changes in the overall economic conditions.  The same factors 
that stimulate economic growth, such as low unemployment, high consumer confidence and low interest 
rates, also stimulate the demand for renovation activities.  For both residential and nonresidential building 
projects, the U.S. Census Bureau tracks information on the “value of construction put in place,” a figure 
composed of some of the variables previously discussed in this chapter such as labor and material costs 
(while also including other variables such as the contractors profit, the cost of architectural and 
engineering work, etc).  Although the definition of construction includes renovations, alterations, 
additions, and other improvements, it does not include “maintenance and repairs to existing structures or 
service facilities” (U.S. Census Bureau 2006d), two components of primary interest to this rule. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
Using this Census data, Figure 2-3 illustrates the relationship between the value of construction put in 
place for private preschools  (a term that includes childcare and day-care centers, nurseries, and 
preschools), state and local elementary school buildings, private primary and secondary educational 
buildings, and real GDP (U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c).14  Both real GDP and the value of state and local 
construction of elementary school buildings substantially increased over the previous 12 years.  
Meanwhile, the value of private preschool construction and private primary and secondary educational 
buildings construction have seen more moderate growth, peaking around 2001 and then gradually 
tapering off.

Construction is a term that encompasses not only the creation of new buildings but renovations to older 
structures as well.  While the Census tracks this breakdown between renovation and new building 
construction for residential construction, it does not for non-residential construction.  The U.S. Census 
Bureau, however, did compile statistics for the expenditures of non-residential improvements in 1986, 
                                                     
14 State and Local Construction of Elementary School Buildings is meant to give an indication of public kindergarten 
construction, while Private Primary and Secondary Educational Building Construction is meant to give an 
indication of private school kindergartens.  Since the variables shown in Figure 2-3 are more broadly defined 
than the variables of interest, they overestimate the value of construction put in place.

1989, and 1992.  The U.S. Census defines improvements as “additions, alterations (renovations, 
remodeling, etc.) and major replacements.”  While not being able to collect data on the number or extent 
of the individual projects, the Census was able to make some estimations in the non-residential domain, 
concluding that “about 23 percent of all buildings had some improvement work, while about 71 percent 
had some expenditures for repair” (U.S. Census Bureau 1999).   The collected data, however, were not 
specific enough to capture improvement expenditures on COFs.  Thus, Table 2-22 presents improvement 
expenditures as the percentage of the total value of non-residential educational building construction put 
in place in each of the three years for which improvement expenditure data were available. 
 
Table 2-22: Improvement Expenditures as a Percentage of the Value of 
Construction Put in Place for Non-Residential Educational Buildings

Buildings 40% 46% 19% 
State and Local Non-Residential 
Educational Buildings 58% 35% 41% 
Source: U.S. Census Bureau 1999, U.S. Census Bureau 2006b,c 
 
As shown in Table 2-22, expenditures on improvements as a percent of the total value of educational 
building construction put in place vary year to year.  Expenditures on improvement made up between 35 
and 58 percent of the total value of construction put in place in either private or state and local non-
residential buildings in the three selected years, with the data moderately variable.  These figures indicate 
that a substantial amount of non-residential educational building expenditures are for activities that might 
disturb lead-based paint.  The high frequency of these improvement activities points to the importance of 
schools in this rule.   
2.5 Renovation Industry Market Structure 
The previous sections focused on the supply and demand for renovation services.  This section discusses 
the overall market structure of the renovation industry. 
Firms and consumers interact in markets for goods and services with the results of these interactions 
depending on the competitive characteristics of the market.  Competitive markets are characterized as 
markets with a large number of buyers (e.g., consumers) and sellers (e.g., firms) and relatively 
homogeneous goods. In competitive markets, neither firms nor consumers can influence the price of the 
good by altering their supply or demand decisions.  Oligopolistic, monopolistic and monopsonistic 
markets are markets where either firms or consumers have market power and exhibit strategic behavior to 
change the price of the good sold.  The competitive nature of an industry can be estimated by examining 
the following market characteristics. 
¾ Number of establishments; 
¾ Specialization of establishments; 
¾ Number of consumers; 
¾ Barriers to entry; 
¾ Availability of substitutes; and 
¾ Homogeneity of the good/service. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-27 
The data in Section 2.1 indicate that there are a large number of firms in the construction industry.  Using 
data for the twelve NAICS codes, there are approximately 394,365 establishments with employees in 
construction sectors potentially affected by the rule.  Of these establishments, only 2.3 percent have 
annual revenues of $10 million or more. In addition, there are about 1.2 million self-employed contractors 
in these industries, all of which are, in all likelihood, considered small by SBA standards.  Given the large 
number of small establishments, it is unlikely that any one firm exhibits substantial market share in the 
overall market for renovation services.  It is possible in some geographic areas for a small number of 
firms or a single firm to establish a market niche, but overall the market for renovation services appears to 
be quite competitive on the supply side. 
The relatively low barriers to entry in the renovation industry enhance the competition taking place within 
it.  Much of the work covered by this rule does not require particularly unusual or high levels of skills.  
Renovation work has traditionally attracted recent immigrants because a lack of English is not important 
(Farzad 2005).  While any training required as part of this rule will increase the skill level, the cost of the 
training is expected to be relatively low. 
There are also a large number of consumers in the industry.  As such, no single consumer of renovation 
services is expected to exhibit influence over the price of these services. 
There are three sources of substitutes for renovation services.  First, consumers can substitute from one 
contractor to another.  Second, consumers can substitute away from professional renovation and into DIY 
work. This is less likely to occur for COFs than for residential RRP work.  Operators of COFs must be 
certified and have their employees trained in order to do covered RRP in the facility.  Third, consumers 
can reduce the scope of the project or forgo renovation altogether.  However, that is unlikely as the cost of 
the rule is a relatively small share of the cost of a renovation.  Again, this is less likely to occur for COFs 
than for residential RRP work.  Many states require annual inspections in COFs that assess the amount of 
chipped or peeling lead-based paint and dictate that appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the 
risk that it imposes.   
Additional characteristics of the RRP market result in reduced demand elasticity.  First, some 
differentiation in RRP services does exist.  Contractors can provide services at a higher price if they can 
convince consumers that their services are better or distinctly different from their competitors.  This is an 
important factor in anticipating the impact of the RRP requirements on contractors.  The costs of safely 
renovating or repairing target housing and COFs are expected to be higher than traditional methods.  If 
the consumer is indifferent between safe- or unsafe-lead work practices, then those companies that choose 
not to use lead-safe work practices may have a competitive advantage in the market due to lower costs.  
However, if the consumer recognizes that higher quality renovation jobs are those jobs completed with 
lead-safe work practices, then firms may be able to comply with the regulation and charge a higher price.  
Under such a scenario, the consumer’s marginal benefit for an additional unit of safe renovation may be 
higher than for an additional unit of unsafe renovation.  The consumer who has a preference for lead-safe 
work practices would choose to do lead-safe renovation as long as the incremental cost of the lead-safe 
renovation is less than the incremental benefit of such a renovation. Also, the market for RRP services is 
fragmented and there are substantial costs involved in getting prices.  Getting bids from various 
contractors takes time and consumers need to compare prices across services that differ along many 
dimensions.  These difficulties make it easier for firms to increase their prices to cover the costs for the 
new requirements. 
The combination of a large number of firms, a large number of consumers, low barriers to entry, and 
available substitutes indicate that the renovation industry is likely to have a relatively high price elasticity 
of supply.  The price elasticity of demand, however, may be small in absolute value.

 Chapter 2 2-28 
2.6 Residential Property Owners & Managers 
Property owners and managers also will be affected by the rule if they choose to perform their own RRP 
projects rather than hire an outside contractor or if their renovation and maintenance costs rise as a result 
of the regulations. 
Property owners and managers may have in-house crews that perform RRP activities.  If this is the case, 
then the property owners and managers will directly bear the costs of training and certifying their workers 
as well as the cost of safe work practices.  Furthermore, because all firms that perform regulated RRP 
projects will experience an increase in costs due to training of supervisors and workers and the use of safe 
work practices, it is assumed that costs to property owners and managers who hire outside contractors will 
increase. 
2.6.1 Industry Definitions and Characteristics 
Establishments involved in the leasing of apartments and other residential units are classified under 
NAICS 531110 - Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings.  This industry, in turn, is divided into 
two sub-sectors, NAICS 5311101—Lessors of Apartment Buildings and NAICS 5311109—Lessors of 
Dwellings Other than Apartment Buildings.  According to the 2002 U.S. Economic Census data, together 
these industries include a total of 61,787 establishments that employ 292,405 people (U.S. Census Bureau 
2004b). 
Establishments involved in the management of residential properties are classified under NAICS 
531311—Residential Property Managers.  In 2002, this industry included 26,233 establishments that 
employed 289,870 people (U.S. Census Bureau 2004b).  Table 2-23 presents summary statistics for the 
businesses in NAICS 531311 as well as NAICS 531110 and its sub-sectors.

2.6.2 Establishment Size and Industry Environment 
The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that to qualify for small business status, a firm in 
NAICS 531110 must have annual revenues of less than $7 million, while establishments in NAICS 
531311 must have revenues of less than $2 million (U.S. Small Business Administration, 2004).  
Although data on the number of firms by revenue bracket were not available from the 2002 U.S. 
Economic Census when this analysis was performed, the average revenues of establishments in these 
NAICS codes are significantly below the small business designation threshold (Table 2-24).

In 1997, 98.7 percent of the then 51,572 establishments in the Lessors of Residential Buildings and 
Dwellings sector had annual revenues below $5 million and about 85 percent of the 19,000 establishments 
in NAICS 531311 had revenues less than $1 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a).15  Because 2002 data 
on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not available at the time the estimates were 
developed, 1997 data was used to estimate the percent of establishments in each industry that qualify for 
small business status.  Table 2-25 presents the percent of NAICS 531311 and NAICS 531110 
establishments that have revenues below $1 million and $5 million, respectively.  The table also presents 
the percent of industry revenues and employment that can be attributed to these establishments.

Based on 1997 data over 85 percent of NAICS 531311 establishments, and about 99 percent of NAICS 
53110 establishments have revenues below the small business threshold defined by SBA.  In the 
Residential Property Manager industry, these establishments contribute only 35 percent of the revenues, 
and employ only 40 percent of the workforce.  The revenue and employment distribution is less skewed in 
the Lessor of Residential Buildings and Dwellings sector.  Small establishments in this industry 
contribute about 82 percent of the revenues and employ 86 percent of the workforce (U.S. Census Bureau 
2000a). 
2.6.3 Industry Outlook 
The market for lead-safe renovation activities will depend in part on the state of the rental housing 
market—an increase in rents would provide resources to construct new housing and/or renovate existing 
                                                     
15 Includes establishments open year-round only. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-30 
housing.  According to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS), “rents fell in 9 of 
the 27 metropolitan areas tracked by the federal government [in 2003].  Nationally, real contract and gross 
rents barely increased last year.”  The JCHS indicates that both the weak labor market and increased 
home ownership contributed to the softening of the rental market (JCHS 2004). 
At the same time as rents fell, the nation-wide rental vacancy rate increased from 8.9 percent in 2002 to 
9.8 percent in 2003.  The vacancy rate was slightly above 10 percent during the first three quarters of 
2004 (U.S. Census Bureau 2004e).  None-the-less, the JCHS predicts a strengthening of the rental market 
over the next ten years due to the influx of immigrants and the aging of the “echo baby-boom generation.”  
The strengthening of the market may also come from overall economic growth and a stemming of home 
ownership growth due to rising interest rates and/or house prices (JCHS 2004). 
2.7 Training Providers 
Impacts of the rule will be felt beyond the construction industry.  Certified renovators will need 
accredited training.  Both initial and refresher training courses will be required for certified renovators. 
2.7.1 Definitions and Industry Characteristics 
It is likely that lead-based paint training courses will be provided by establishments categorized as 
NAICS code 611519: Other Technical and Trade Schools.  Census defines NAICS 61159 as 
“establishments primarily engaged in offering job or career vocational or technical courses (except 
cosmetology and barber training, aviation and flight training, and apprenticeship training).  The 
curriculums offered by these schools are highly structured and specialized and lead to job-specific 
certification” and these establishments are believed to currently provide training for lead abatement 
professionals (U.S. Census Bureau 2004p). 
According to the 2002 Economic Census, there are a total of 3,323 establishments in the U.S. certified as 
Other Technical and Trade Schools (see Table 2-26).  On average, each establishment employs 15.3 
people. A striking characteristic is that about 19% of these establishments are exempt from the Federal 
Income Tax (FIT).  Exempt establishments include non-profit organizations and educational institutions 
such as colleges or universities.

Table 2-27 summarizes available financial information for establishments categorized under NAICS 
611519.  These include total revenues for the sector, average annual revenues per establishment, annual 
payroll for the sector, and payroll as a percent of revenue.  As Table 2-27 indicates, for Other Technical 
and Trade schools, annual payroll is equal to about 35 percent of establishment revenue.

According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, in order to qualify as a small business, a firm 
categorized under NAICS 611519 must have annual revenues of $7 million or less (U.S. Small Business 
Administration 2006a).16  The 2002 Economic Census provided data on the number of firms by revenue 
bracket.  In 2002, 94 percent of the then 2,274 firms classified as Other Technical and Trade Schools that 
were in operation for the entire year had revenues under $5 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f).  This 
figure indicates that a large percentage of firms had revenues under the $6.5 million threshold and thus 
qualified for small business status.  
2.7.2 Number and Type of Training Establishments 
As mentioned in Section 2.7.1, there are over 3,000 establishments in the Other Technical and Trade 
school industry.  It is likely that only a small portion of these establishments are involved in lead based 
paint-related training.  To help characterize the lead training segment of the training provider industry, a 
random sample of firms that offer one or more of the courses required for EPA lead abatement 
certification were identified as part of the economic analysis of the 2006 proposed LRRP target housing 
rule (EPA 2006).  The goal was both to collect tuition data for currently offered lead abatement training 
courses and to learn what types of institutions (private establishments, non-profits, unions, etc.) offer 
these classes. 
The sample consisted of 83 establishments selected from the Lead Listing17 directory of 194 training 
providers.18  Data were collected from company web sites (when available) and/or over the phone. 
Information was obtained from 68 training providers; a total of 15 training providers could not be 
reached.  Seven of the 68 contacted providers no longer offered lead abatement training courses. 
There were five types of training providers in the sample: private for-profit establishments, non-profit 
establishments, educational institutions, trade unions and public/government training institutions.  Trade 
unions provide tuition-free training to their members.  Public/government providers train state employees 
and workers who qualify for financial assistance through government programs.  They do not offer 
training to the general public. 
                                                     
16 Effective July 31st, 2006. 
17 The Lead Listing (www.leadlisting.org) website was run for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development’s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control that contained a directory of lead service 
providers.  It is no longer in operation (as of late 2004). 
18 The sample included all the establishments on the list that are certified to offer a Project Designer course (42 
total), as well as a random sample of 41 establishments that were not certified to offer this class. The data were 
weighted by the inversed probability of selection into the sample (P=1 for providers that offer a Project 
Designer course and P=.270 for providers that do not offer this class).  It was assumed that there was no non-
response bias. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-32 
Table 2-28 summarizes the number of private establishments, educational institutions, non-profits, unions 
and public government providers that appeared in the sample.  The table also presents the estimated 
national number of providers that fall into each of these categories.  More than a third of lead hazard 
reduction training providers are private, for-profit establishments.  The next largest group of providers is 
labor unions, followed by educational institutions (colleges and universities).  None of the unions, 
however, are certified to offer the Project Designer course. About 13 percent of certified providers either 
do not offer training at this time, or have permanently stopped offering lead courses. 
More than half of the privately owned, for-profit establishments in the sample (19 out of 35) offer 
environmental consulting services in addition to training.  Thirteen of the 35 privately-owned providers 
specialize in training and do not offer other services.  All of these 13 firms offer both lead and asbestos 
training courses, as well as, in most cases, OSHA safety, HAZ-MAT and/or mold classes.  Although there 
was not enough information to determine the services provided by the remaining three companies, these 
findings indicate that lead-based paint training providers generally participate in several lines of business.

2.8 Summary Characteristics: Numbers of Structures in the Regulated 
Universe 
This section provides summary information about the numbers of target housing and public or 
commercial building COFs that form the basis for the analyses presented in the subsequent chapters of 
this report.  Each tally is then subdivided into categories based on the age of the building and the type of 
structure.  After each table, there is a discussion of how the numbers presented in that table were 
calculated.  
Table 2-29 provides counts of the number of buildings by type and vintage of building. There are 78.0 
million structures that would be covered by the LRRP rule if the proposed LRRP Opt-Out and 
Recordkeeping rule is finalized.  These units include 77.9 million target housing units and 0.1 million 
COFs in public or commercial buildings.  About 40.2 million target housing units would be added to the 
regulated universe due to the elimination of the opt-out provision.  Table 2-29 also shows the regulated 
universe under the existing 2008 LRRP rule (37.7 million target housing units and 0.1 million public and 
commercial buildings).

2.8.1 Target Housing 
This section provides a brief discussion of the estimates of the number of the target housing units 
presented in Table 2-29. Estimates of the number of housing units by tenure of occupant (owner or 
renter), age of occupants, and pregnancy status of occupants were estimated using the 2003 American 
Housing Survey, which is described in more detail in Section 4.2 of the Economic Analysis for the LRRP 
Opt-Out and Recordkeeping Proposed Rule (EPA 2009).  EPA (2009) also provides a detailed 
explanation of the estimated number of target housing units that are defined as COFs.  The COFs in target 
housing include family daycare providers and the homes of family, friends, and neighbors who regularly 
care for someone else’s children.  These estimates include care provided for pay and not for pay, and rely 
primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare workforce as published by the Center for Childcare 
Workforce, 2002.  This report includes data on the number of: (1) family childcare providers caring for 
unrelated children, (2) paid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare, and (3) unpaid relatives and 
non-relatives providing childcare.  Based on data provided by the Center for Childcare Workforce, a total 
of just under 2.4 million caregivers provide care outside of the child’s home for more than six hours per 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-34 
week.  As described in detail EPA (2009), these data are used to estimate the number of COFs in target 
housing.  These numbers are further reduced to estimate the number of pre-1960 and pre-1978 housing 
units based on American Housing Survey data.   
2.8.2 Childcare Centers 
In 2006, the National Association for Regulatory Administration (NARA) released a report entitled “The 
2005 Childcare Licensing Study” providing counts of all the licensed childcare centers and family 
childcare homes in the United States. The NARA report indicated that there were approximately 115,000 
licensed childcare centers, 66,700 of which are estimated to be built before 1978 according to 
Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data (DOE 2003).  According to HUD's 
First National Health Survey of Childcare Centers (HUD 2003), approximately 24 percent of licensed 
centers are located in elementary schools.  These 15,753 centers are assumed to be included in the 
estimated 40,190 elementary schools with pre-schools and kindergartens.  Thus, there are a total of 
50,947 pre-1978 daycare centers located outside of elementary schools.  According to NCES data on 
public and private schools, however, an additional 824 pre-1978 schools without kindergartens have a 
pre-kindergarten program, which brings the total number of buildings accounted for as daycare centers to 
51,771 (EPA 2008).   
2.8.2.1 Public Schools 
The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reported that during the 2004-2005 academic year, 
there were more than 93,000 public schools in the United States.  Of these 93,295 public schools, 52,129 
had either a pre-kindergarten (PK) or kindergarten (K) program. The Common Core of Data Public 
Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey data was used to calculate the number of private schools 
with PK or K programs.  Using this data, a school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-
kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade 
offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment data were not provided.  Similarly, a school was considered 
as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten enrollment was greater than zero, or b) the school reported that 
the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten or kindergarten, but did not report kindergarten enrollment.  
Again, the educational building age distribution found in CBECS and HUD (2003) was applied to the 
total counts, resulting in the estimated 17,000 pre-1960, and 30,000 pre-1978 public schools. 
2.8.2.2 Private Schools 
This analysis used NCES’s Results from the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey report and the 
underlying dataset to estimate the number of private schools with kindergartens and/or pre-kindergartens.  
A school was considered as having a pre-kindergarten if a) pre-kindergarten enrollment was greater than 
zero students, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-kindergarten, but enrollment 
data were not provided.  Similarly, a school was considered as having a kindergarten if a) kindergarten 
enrollment was greater than zero, or b) the school reported that the lowest grade offered was pre-
kindergarten or kindergarten, but did not report kindergarten enrollment.  The previously cited CBECS 
and HUD educational building age distribution was then applied to the private school universe to 
calculate the number of private schools by age of construction.  This adjustment yielded 9,000 pre-1960, 
and 15,000 pre-1978 private schools. 
For the purpose of the total cost analysis, private and public schools were categorized according to 
whether they offered kindergarten only, kindergarten and pre-kindergarten, and pre-kindergarten only.  
Table 2-29 uses information drawn from Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 to obtain the total number of schools 
with each combination of programs.  Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 indicate that there are 29,844 public 
schools and 7,205 private schools with kindergarten programs only, for a total of 37,049 such schools.  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 2 2-35 
Table 2-9 and Table 2-16 also indicate that there are 20,885 public schools and 19,305 private schools 
with both pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs.  Finally, there are a total of 1,400 public and 21 
private schools with pre-kindergarten, but no kindergarten, which are accounted for as daycare centers for 
the purposes of the analysis.  Table 2-29 presents the total number of schools with kindergartens, 
kindergartens and pre-kindergartens, and pre-kindergartens only by age of construction.  Information 
about the age distribution of buildings was taken from CBECS and HUD and applied to the data to give 
estimates of the number of schools by the age of the building.

3. Problem Definition: Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazards and the 
Justification for Regulation 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide background information on the existence of residential lead-
based paint hazards and present an overview of the economic justifications for federal regulations to 
address these problems.  Section 3.1 characterizes the residential lead contamination problem and 
discusses various sources of exposure.  In Section 3.2, the regulatory background associated with 
residential lead-based paint hazards is presented.  Section 3.3 discusses how market failure due to 
incomplete information and external costs result in inefficient levels of lead containment and control in 
renovation activities, requiring regulatory intervention.  Section 3.4 describes how the proposed rule will 
address these market failures.   
3.1 Lead Contamination Problem 
Despite recent reductions in air, water, and food contamination, important sources of lead exposure 
remain, due largely to the widespread presence of lead-based paint.  Exposure to lead results in increased 
blood lead levels associated with various adverse health effects, including reductions in IQ and other 
negative cognitive effects, particularly in children.  In addition, exposure to lead can result in a variety of 
adverse health effects in adults. 
3.1.1 Exposure Sources 
As described in Chapter 5, lead may cause adverse health effects in any individual, exposed at any stage 
of life (in utero through adulthood) (U.S. EPA 2005c).  However, young children are particularly 
susceptible to lead hazards because their central nervous systems are rapidly developing, and because 
their behavior is likely to result in greater exposure to lead than older individuals experience.   
Currently, the most significant high-dose source of lead exposure in children under school age is lead-
based paint.  Through the 1940's, paint manufacturers used lead as a primary ingredient in many oil-based 
interior and exterior house paints.  During the 1950's and 1960's, the usage gradually decreased as new 
paints were developed, and in 1978 the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) ruled that paint 
used for residences, toys, furniture, and public areas must not contain more than 0.06% lead by weight.  
Nevertheless, about 50 percent of housing units and public and commercial buildings constructed before 
1980 still contain lead-based paint (U.S. HUD 2000).  Children’s exposure to lead from lead-based paint 
is likely to be high when the paint is in a deteriorated state or is found on accessible, chewable, impact, or 
friction surfaces, making the lead paint available to children who ingest paint chips.  This “pica” behavior 
appears to be rare, but is the likely cause of many of the highest blood lead levels observed in children.  
Renovation activities can create lead-based paint hazards for children by making paint chips more 
accessible for ingestion.  These hazards can occur both within and outside the building unit being 
renovated. 
In addition to being a source of direct exposure, lead-based paint can be the source of lead contamination 
in soil and dust.  Children are exposed to lead from soil or dust in their homes as a result of typical hand-
to-mouth activities.  Lead-contaminated dust and soil are the major pathway through which most young 
children are exposed to lead from lead-based paint hazards.  Renovation activities increase the level of 
lead dust in the facility and in the soil, thereby increasing the risk of lead ingestion in young children. 
While occupational exposure is the primary exposure pathway to lead for adults, other common exposure 
pathways for teenagers and adults include gardening, housework, drinking water and certain hobbies such 
as creating objects from stained-glass and making pottery.  Individuals (children, teenagers and adults) are 
also exposed to a variety of other lead sources, some of which are localized in nature.   
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-2 
Airborne lead is present in emissions from lead smelters, battery manufacturing plants, and solid waste 
incinerators.  The phase-out of leaded gasoline has substantially reduced airborne lead.  Drinking water 
may become contaminated with lead after it leaves the treatment plant.  Although lead levels in drinking 
water generally do not have a statistically significant effect on blood-lead concentrations as a result of 
regulations stemming from the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act, water is still considered an important 
localized exposure source where lead solder and/or brass plumbing fixtures are present because of the 
high absorption rate of lead in water.  Lead exposure through food ingestion has declined greatly due to 
the phase-out of lead-soldered food cans and public education.  With these improvements in exposure 
from air, water, and food, lead-based paint remains as the largest widespread source of lead exposure. 
3.1.2 Lead from Renovation Activities 
EPA exposure data (EPA 1997) indicate that renovation activities potentially increase both short-term and 
long-term lead exposure levels.  Lead concentrations are greatest in the area where the renovation work is 
performed, but lead does settle into other areas of the building and potentially the surrounding area, 
causing longer-term exposure.  The study found that, with the exception of carpet removal and drilling 
into plaster, all renovation activities examined deposited significant amounts of lead onto the floors in the 
area where the work was being performed, ranging from 480 micrograms per square foot for sawing to 
15,500 micrograms per square foot for paint removal.  This lead may be ingested or inhaled by occupants 
if proper containment and clean-up practices are not used.  The study found that sweeping and shop-
vacuum clean-up, considered to be standard practice in the industry, reduced the total amount of lead 
available to occupants.  However, as the distance from the activity increased, the cleanup left a higher 
percentage of the lead behind so that lead hazards remained following cleanup.  These findings 
demonstrate that these practices do not adequately reduce risks from lead dust generated by renovation 
activities.  Lead dust settled in carpeted areas or in soil is the most difficult to remove with simple broom 
and vacuum clean-up and thereby creates the longest lasting exposure pathway for facility occupants. 
EPA conducted a field study in 2007 (Characterization of Dust Lead Levels after Renovation, Repair, and 
Painting Activities) (the ‘‘Dust Study’’) to characterize dust lead levels resulting from various renovation, 
repair, and painting activities (EPA 2007). This study was designed to compare environmental lead levels 
at appropriate stages after various types of renovation, repair, and painting preparation activities were 
performed on the interiors and exteriors of target housing units and child-occupied facilities. All of the 
jobs disturbed more than 2 square feet of lead-based paint, so they would not have been eligible for the 
minor maintenance exception. The renovation activities were conducted by local professional renovation 
firms, using personnel who received lead safe work practices training using the curriculum developed by 
EPA and HUD, ‘‘Lead Safety for Remodeling, Repair, and Painting’’ (EPA 2003a). The activities 
conducted represented a range of activities that would be permitted under the 2006 Proposal, including 
work practices that are restricted or prohibited for abatements under 40 CFR 745.227(e)(6). Of particular 
interest was the impact of using specific work practices that renovation firms would be required to use 
under the proposed rule, such as the use of plastic to contain the work area and a multi-step cleaning 
protocol, as opposed to more typical work practices. 
In the Dust Study, 12 different interior and 12 different exterior renovation activities were performed at 7 
vacant target housing units in Columbus, Ohio, and 8 vacant target housing units (including four 
apartments) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Three different interior and three different exterior renovation 
activities were conducted at a building representing a child-occupied facility, a vacant school in 
Columbus.  The presence of lead-based paint was confirmed by laboratory analysis before a building was 
assigned a particular renovation activity or set of activities.  Before interior renovation activities were 
performed, the floors and windowsills in the work area and adjacent rooms were cleaned.  In most cases, 
pre-work cleaning resulted in dust lead levels on floors of less than 10 μg/ft2; nearly all floors were less 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-3 
than 40 μg/ft2 before work started.  Most windowsills that would be used for later sampling were cleaned 
to dust lead levels less than 250 μg/ft2.  In the few cases where that level was not achieved on a 
windowsill needed for sampling, dust collection trays were used. Interior renovation activities included 
the following jobs:  
¾ Making cut-outs in the walls.  
¾ Replacing a window from the inside.  
¾ Removing paint with a high temperature (greater than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.  
¾ Removing paint with a low temperature (less than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit) heat gun.  
¾ Removing paint by dry scraping.  
¾ Removing kitchen cabinets.  
¾ Removing paint with a power planer.  
To illustrate the impact of the containment plastic and the specialized cleaning and cleaning verification 
protocol that would be required by the 2006 Proposal, each activity was performed a minimum of four 
times:  
¾ With the plastic containment described in the 2006 Proposal followed by the cleaning protocol 
described in the proposal.  
¾ With the plastic containment described in the 2006 Proposal followed by dry sweeping and 
vacuuming with a shop vacuum.  
¾ With no plastic containment followed by the cleaning protocol described in the 2006 Proposal.  
¾ With no plastic containment followed by dry sweeping and vacuuming with a shop vacuum.  
Dust samples were collected after the renovation work was completed, after cleaning, and after cleaning 
verification. If a building was being used again for the same job under different work practices, or for a 
completely different job, the unit was recleaned and retested prior to starting the next job. All buildings 
were cleaned and tested after the last job.  
For the exterior jobs, plastic sheeting was placed on the ground to catch the debris and dust from the job, 
in accordance with the requirements of the proposed rule. Additional plastic sheeting was laid out beneath 
and beyond the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. Trays to collect dust and debris were placed on top of and 
underneath the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. Trays were also placed just outside of the ‘‘proposed rule’’ 
plastic to assess how far the dust was spreading. A vertical containment, as high as the work zone, was 
erected at the end of the additional plastic.  
The use of the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic as a ground covering captured large amounts of leaded dust. For 
all job types except removing paint with a torch, there was a substantial difference between the amount of 
lead captured by the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic and the amount under the ‘‘proposed rule’’ plastic. The 
2008 final LRRP rule was supported by the Dust Study discussed above. Therefore, EPA conducted a 
peer review in accordance with OMB’s Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. EPA 
requested this review from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) Lead Review Panel. 
The CASAC, which is comprised of seven members appointed by the EPA Administrator, was 
established under the Clean Air Act as an independent scientific advisory committee. The CASAC’s 
comments on the Dust Study, along with EPA’s responses, have been placed into the public docket for 
this action. More information on the CASAC consultation process, along with background documents, is 
available on EPA’s website at http://www.epa.gov/ lead/pubs/casac.htm.  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-4 
According to the peer review report, the CASAC Panel found  
“. . .that the [Dust Study] was reasonably well-designed, considering the complexity of the 
problem, and that the report provided information not available from any other source. The study 
indicated that the rule cleaning procedures reduced the residual lead (Pb) remaining after a 
renovation more than did the baseline cleaning procedures. Another positive aspect of the Dust 
Study was that it described deviations from the protocol when they occurred. “ 
The CASAC Panel also contended that the limited data from residential housing units and child-occupied 
facilities included in the Dust Study, most likely do not represent a statistically valid sample of housing at 
the national level. They noted that there are aspects of the study that would underestimate the levels of 
lead-loadings while other aspects of the study would overestimate the loadings. EPA agrees that the Dust 
Study is not nationally representative of all housing. EPA notes that there are several reasons why this is 
the case, including the fact that all of the housing studied was built during 1925 or earlier, and a large 
number of the floors were in poor condition. A major purpose of the Dust Study was to assess the 
proposed work practices. A statistically valid sample of housing at the national level is not needed to 
assess the work practices. If anything, the Dust Study is conservative with respect to the age of housing 
because it studied older houses and therefore is appropriate for assessing the effectiveness of the work 
practices.  
3.2 Regulatory Background 
This section outlines the extensive history of lead-based paint regulations at the federal level.  Childhood 
lead exposure continues to be a major public health problem among young children in the United States.  
Most children with blood lead levels in excess of CDC’s current level of concern have been exposed to 
lead in non-intact paint, interior settled dust, and dust and soil in and around deteriorating older housing 
(CDC 2004).  The nature and extent of the problems associated with lead-based paint in housing units 
have been thoroughly investigated.  Approximately 40% of all U.S. housing units (about 38 million 
homes) have some lead-based paint.  Use of lead safe work practices during renovation can advance the 
goal of primary prevention of lead poisoning (CDC 2004).  
3.2.1 The Federal Lead-based Paint Program 
Title X and the Federal goal 
Primarily in response to the persistent health threat posed by lead-based paint, in 1992 Congress enacted 
Title X. Congress found that low-level lead poisoning was widespread among American children, 
affecting, at that time, as many as 3 million children under age 6; that the ingestion of household dust 
containing lead from deteriorating or abraded lead-based paint was the most common cause of lead 
poisoning in children; and that the health and development of children living in as many as 3.8 million 
American homes was endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive amounts of lead-
contaminated dust in their homes.  Congress determined that the prior Federal response to this crisis was 
insufficient and established, in Title X, a national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards as 
expeditiously as possible. Congress decided that the Federal government would take a leadership role in 
building the infrastructure necessary to achieve this goal. 
The stated purposes of Title X are: 
¾ To develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint 
hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-5 
¾ To reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint in housing to implement, on 
a priority basis, a broad program to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation’s 
housing stock. 
¾ To encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable 
framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current 
confusion over reasonable standards of care. 
¾ To ensure that the existence of lead-based paint hazards is taken into account in the development 
of Government housing policies and in the sale, rental, and renovation of homes and apartments. 
¾ To mobilize national resources expeditiously, through a partnership among all levels of 
government and the private sector, to develop the most promising, cost-effective methods for 
evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards. 
¾ To reduce the threat of childhood lead poisoning in housing owned, assisted, or transferred by the 
Federal Government.  
¾ To educate the public concerning the hazards and sources of lead-based paint poisoning and steps 
to reduce and eliminate such hazards (Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 
1992). 
EPA’s lead-based paint program 
Under Title X, EPA is directed to take actions that can be divided into 4 key categories: 
¾ Establishing a training and certification program for persons engaged in lead-based paint 
activities, accrediting training providers, establishing work practice standards for the safe, 
reliable, and effective identification and elimination of lead-based paint hazards, and developing a 
program to address exposure to lead-based paint hazards from renovation and remodeling 
activities. 
¾ Ensuring that, for most housing constructed before 1978, lead-based paint information flows from 
sellers to purchasers, from landlords to tenants, and from renovators to owners and occupants.   
¾ Establishing standards for identifying dangerous levels of lead in paint, dust and soil. 
¾ Providing information on lead hazards to the public, including steps that people can take to 
protect themselves and their families from lead-based paint hazards.  Each of these categories is 
discussed in more detail in the following sections. 
a.  Training and certification, accreditation, and work practice standards.  Title X added a new title to 
TSCA entitled ‘‘Title IV Lead Exposure Reduction.’’ Most of EPA’s responsibilities for addressing lead-
based paint hazards can be found in this title, with section 402 being one source of the rulemaking 
authority to carry out these responsibilities.  TSCA section 402(a) directs EPA to promulgate regulations 
covering lead-based paint activities to ensure persons performing these activities are properly trained, that 
training programs are accredited, and that contractors performing these activities are certified.  These 
regulations must contain standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account 
reliability, effectiveness, and safety. 
On August 29, 1996, EPA promulgated final regulations under TSCA section 402(a) governing lead-
based paint inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments, and abatements in target housing (U.S. 
EPA 1996).  TSCA section 401 defines ‘‘target housing’’ as any housing constructed prior to 1978, 
except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age 
resides or is expected to reside in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0-

 Chapter 3 3-6 
bedroom dwelling.  These regulations also apply to ‘‘child-occupied facilities,’’ which are defined at 40 
CFR 745.223 as buildings constructed before 1978, or portions of such buildings, where children under 
age 6 are regularly present.  TSCA section 402 defines lead-based paint activities in target housing as 
inspections, risk assessments and abatements.  The 1996 regulations cover lead-based paint abatement 
activities in target housing and child-occupied facilities, along with limited screening activities called lead 
hazard screens.  The regulations also established an accreditation program for training providers and a 
certification program for individuals and firms performing these activities.  Training providers who wish 
to provide lead-based paint training for the purposes of the Federal lead-based paint program must be 
accredited by EPA.  Implementing regulations at 40 CFR 745.225 describe in detail the requirements for 
each course of study, how training programs must be operated, and the process for obtaining 
accreditation.  Training programs must have a training manager with experience or education in a 
construction or environmental field, and a principal instructor with experience or education in a related 
field and education or experience in teaching adults.  Training programs must also have adequate facilities 
and equipment for delivering the training.  To become accredited, an application for accreditation must be 
submitted to EPA on behalf of the training program.  The application must either include the course 
materials and syllabus, or a statement that EPA model materials or materials approved by an authorized 
State or Tribe will be used.  The application must also include a description of the facilities and 
equipment that will be used, a copy of the test blueprint for each course, a description of the activities and 
procedures that will be used during the hands-on skills portion of each course, a copy of the quality 
control plan, and the correct amount of fees.  If EPA finds that the program meets the regulatory 
requirements, it will accredit the training program for 4 years.  To maintain accreditation, the training 
program must submit an application and the correct amount of fees every 4 years. 
Individuals and firms that perform inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments, or abatements in 
target housing or child-occupied facilities must be certified.  Certification requirements and the process 
for becoming certified are described in 40 CFR 745.226.  A firm that wishes to become certified must 
submit an application, along with the correct amount of fees, attesting that it will use only certified 
individuals to perform lead-based paint activities and that it will follow the work practice standards in 40 
CFR 745.227.  An individual who wishes to become certified must take an accredited training course in at 
least one of the certified disciplines: Inspector, risk assessor, project designer, abatement worker, and 
abatement supervisor.  The risk assessor, project designer, and abatement supervisor disciplines have 
additional requirements for education or experience in a construction or environmental field.  The 
inspector, risk assessor, and abatement supervisor disciplines also require the applicant to pass a 
certification examination administered by a third party.  
The regulations at 40 CFR part 745, subpart L, also contain work practice standards for performing 
inspections, lead hazard screens, risk assessments and abatements in target housing and child-occupied 
facilities.  The regulations contain specific requirements for conducting paint sampling during an 
inspection and specify information that must be gathered and samples that must be taken as part of a lead 
hazard screen or risk assessment.  The requirements for abatements are also set forth in the regulations. 
When conducting abatements, an occupant protection plan must be prepared by a certified supervisor or 
project designer; certain work practices such as open-flame burning, machine sanding or abrasive blasting 
without high-efficiency exhaust control, dry scraping, and heat guns at high settings are prohibited; and a 
visual inspection and dust clearance sampling must be performed after the abatement is finished to ensure 
that the area is ready for re-occupancy.  Any samples collected during any of these regulated lead-based 
paint activities must be analyzed by a laboratory recognized by EPA as being capable of analyzing paint 
chips, dust, and soil for lead.  Requirements for inspection, lead hazard screen, risk assessment or 
abatement reports are also described in this section  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-7 
Recognizing the importance of States and Territories in achieving the goal of eliminating lead-based paint 
hazards in housing, Congress specifically directed EPA to establish a model State program and a process 
for authorizing States to operate such programs in lieu of the Federal program.  Concurrently with the 
subpart L rulemaking in 1996, EPA codified, at 40 CFR part 745, subpart Q, a model training and 
certification program and a process for enabling States, Territories, and Tribes to apply for authorization 
to administer their own lead-based paint activity programs.  Providing Indian Tribes with this opportunity 
is consistent with EPA’s Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian 
Reservations (U.S. EPA 1984).  EPA also provides grants under TSCA section 404 to States, Territories, 
and Tribes to assist them in developing and administering these programs, as well as programs 
implementing TSCA section 406(b).  On June 9, 1999, the subpart L regulations were amended to include 
a fee schedule for training programs seeking EPA accreditation and for individuals and firms seeking 
EPA certification (U.S. EPA 1999).  These fees were established as directed by TSCA section 402(a)(3), 
which requires EPA to recover the cost of administering and enforcing the lead-based paint activities 
requirements in unauthorized States.  The most recent amendment to the subpart L regulations occurred 
on March 20, 2009 (U.S. EPA 2009).  
In addition, Congress directed EPA, in TSCA section 405, to establish protocols, criteria, and minimum 
performance standards for analysis of lead in paint, dust, and soil.  TSCA section 405 further directed 
EPA, in consultation with HHS, to develop a program to certify qualified laboratories.  The National Lead 
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) provides the public with a list of laboratories that have met 
EPA requirements and demonstrated the capability to accurately analyze paint chip, dust, or soil samples 
for lead.  All laboratories recognized by NLLAP must pass on-site audits conducted by one of the two 
accrediting organizations currently participating in NLLAP, the American Industrial Hygiene Association 
(AIHA), and the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation.  Recognized laboratories must also 
perform successfully on a continuing basis in the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing 
(ELPAT) Program established by NIOSH, AIHA, and EPA.  
The LRRP rule for target housing and COFs was promulgated in 2008 (73 FR 21692) and is codified in 
Part 745 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The rule was promulgated under the 
authority of §402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).  Section IV of TSCA was established 
by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, also known as Title X of the 
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102-550.    
The 2008 LRRP regulation requires entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for 
compensation in buildings covered by the rule to become certified by EPA, ensure that their employees 
are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices when disturbing lead-based 
paint.   
b.  Lead-based paint information for purchasers, renters, owners, and occupants of target housing.  
Another of EPA’s responsibilities under Title X is to require that purchasers and tenants of target housing, 
as well as occupants of target housing and parents of children in COFs undergoing renovation are 
provided information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards.  As directed by TSCA section 
406(a), CPSC, HUD, and EPA, in consultation with CDC, jointly developed a lead hazard information 
pamphlet entitled ‘‘Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home’’ (‘‘PYF’’) (U.S. EPA et al 2003b).  
This pamphlet was designed to be distributed as part of the disclosure requirements of section 1018 of 
Title X and TSCA section 406(b), to provide home purchasers, renters, owners, and occupants with the 
information necessary to allow them to make informed choices when selecting housing to buy or rent, or 
deciding on home renovation projects.  The pamphlet contains information on the health effects of lead, 
how exposure can occur, and steps that can be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure during 
various activities in the home. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-8 
Pursuant to the authority provided in section 1018 of Title X, on March 6, 1996, HUD and EPA jointly 
promulgated regulations requiring persons who are selling or leasing target housing to provide the PYF 
pamphlet and information on known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the housing to 
purchasers and renters (HUD and U.S. EPA 1996).  These joint regulations, codified at 24 CFR part 35, 
subpart A, and 40 CFR part 745, subpart F, describe in detail the information that must be provided 
before the contract or lease is signed and require that sellers, landlords, and agents document compliance 
with the disclosure requirements in the contract to sell or lease the property.  Title X does not provide for 
these requirements to be administered by States or Tribes in lieu of the Federal regulations.  Therefore, 
HUD and EPA are responsible for administering and enforcing these disclosure obligations. 
TSCA section 406(b) directs EPA to promulgate regulations requiring persons who perform home 
renovations for compensation to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to owners and occupants of 
target housing being renovated.  These regulations, promulgated on June 1, 1998, are codified at 40 CFR 
part 745, subpart E (U.S. EPA 1998).  The term ‘‘renovation’’ is defined, at 40 CFR 745.83, as the 
modification of any existing structure, or portion of a structure, that results in the disturbance of painted 
surfaces.  Lead-based paint abatement projects are specifically excluded, as are small projects that disturb 
2 square feet or less of painted surfaces, emergency projects, and renovations affecting components that 
have been found to be free of lead-based paint, as that term is defined in the regulations, by a certified 
inspector or risk assessor.  Like the regulations regarding disclosure during sales or leases, these 
regulations require the renovation firm to document compliance with the requirement to provide the 
owner and the occupant with the PYF pamphlet.  One important difference from the disclosure 
requirements in section 1018 of Title X is that TSCA section 404 allows States to apply for, and receive 
authorization to administer, the TSCA section 406(b) requirements.  Two States are currently authorized 
to operate this program. 
c.  Standards for lead in paint, dust, and soil.  Another responsibility assigned to EPA by Title X is the 
development of standards for identifying dangerous levels of lead in paint, dust and soil.  These standards, 
promulgated pursuant to TSCA section 403 on January 5, 2001 and codified at 40 CFR part 745, subpart 
D, provide various Federal agencies, including HUD, and State, local and Tribal governments with 
uniform benchmarks on which to base decisions on remedial actions to safeguard children and the public 
from lead-based paint hazards (U.S. EPA 2001b).  These standards also allow certified inspectors and risk 
assessors to easily determine whether a particular situation presents a lead-based paint hazard and whether 
to recommend remedial actions such as lead-based paint abatement, cleaning of dust, or removal of soil.  
The standards define lead-based paint hazards in target housing and child-occupied facilities as paint-lead, 
dust-lead, and soil-lead hazards.  A paint-lead hazard is defined as any damaged or deteriorated lead-
based paint, any chewable lead-based painted surface with evidence of teeth marks, or any lead-based 
paint on a friction surface if lead dust levels underneath the friction surface exceed the dust-lead hazard 
standards.  A dust-lead hazard is surface dust that contains a mass-per-area concentration of lead equal to 
or exceeding 40 micrograms per square foot (µg/ft2) on floors or 250 µg/ft2on interior windowsills based 
on wipe samples.  A soil-lead hazard is bare soil that contains total lead equal to or exceeding 400 parts 
per million (µg/g) in a play area or average of 1,200 parts per million of bare soil in the rest of the yard 
based on soil samples. 
d.  Public outreach and education.  Among other things, TSCA section 405(d) directs EPA, along with 
the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and HUD, to sponsor public education 
and outreach activities to increase public awareness of the health effects of lead, the potential for 
exposures, the importance of screening children for elevated blood lead levels, and measures that can be 
taken to reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards.  Accordingly, EPA has worked to provide the 
public with information and increase public awareness of such matters.  To date, these activities have 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-9 
included web site management, development of public outreach strategies, development of partnership 
agreements, distribution of materials, participation in national conferences and exhibits, and developing 
hazard information documents (and other media, such as videos), as necessary to implement Title X. EPA 
has collaborated closely with other Federal agencies and its State, Tribal, and local government partners 
in developing outreach campaigns.  EPA has also been involved in developing model tool kits of various 
educational tools to provide to partners, such as slogans and graphic materials for public buses, trains, and 
mass transit stations. 
TSCA section 405(e) further directs EPA to establish, in connection with HUD, CDC, other Federal 
agencies, and State and local governments, a clearinghouse for information on lead-based paint and a 
hotline for the public to use for questions and requests for information on lead-based paint.  This 
clearinghouse, the National Lead Information Center, handles approximately 50,000 calls per year, and 
disseminates up to 500,000 documents per year to the public. 
Lead-based paint programs at other Federal agencies 
In addition to EPA, other Federal agencies have important roles in achieving the goals of reducing or 
eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing.  Other agencies specifically assigned tasks in Title X 
include HUD, CDC, and OSHA. 
The Federal agencies have long realized that they must work together to develop and implement Federal 
strategies for addressing lead-based paint hazards in order to be efficient and effective.  In 1989, HUD 
and EPA formed an inter-agency task force to work through issues associated with lead-based paint 
abatement.  The Federal Interagency Lead Based Paint Task Force has remained active throughout the 
years and continues to meet on a quarterly basis.  Participating agencies include the Department of 
Defense, the Veterans Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the 
U.S. Public Health Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the National 
Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), ATSDR, CDC, CPSC, NIOSH, OSHA, HUD, and 
EPA.  This Task Force serves as an important forum for coordinating the strategic plans of the Federal 
agencies who have responsibilities under Title X or who have responsibilities for maintaining and 
disposing of property that may contain lead-based paint. 
Title X assigned certain responsibilities to HUD.  One of HUD’s functions is the administration of the 
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant Program established by the Act.  This program provides grants of 
$1 million to $3 million to State and local governments for control of lead-based paint hazards in 
privately owned, low-income owner-occupied and rental housing that is not receiving federal assistance. 
These grants are also designed to stimulate the development of a trained and certified hazard evaluation 
and control industry.  Evaluation and hazard control work funded by the program must be conducted by 
either contractors who are certified by EPA or an EPA-approved State or Tribal program, or by 
contractors trained in lead-safe work practices, in the case of interim controls.  Through these 
requirements, HUD hopes to create infrastructure that will last beyond the life of the grant.  In awarding 
grants, HUD promotes the use of cost-effective approaches to hazard control that can be replicated across 
the nation.  Since 1993, approximately $971 million has been awarded to over 200 local and State 
jurisdictions across the country.  The work approved to date will lead to the control of lead-based paint 
hazards in more than 70,000 homes where young children reside or are expected to reside.  Other HUD 
lead grant programs include the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration program, the Lead Elimination 
Action Program (LEAP), the Lead Outreach program and the Lead Technical Studies program. 
HUD was also given regulatory authority over some aspects of lead based paint hazard control.  As noted 
previously, on March 6, 1996, HUD and EPA jointly promulgated regulations requiring the disclosure of 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-10 
lead-based paint information during sale or lease transactions involving target housing.  The HUD 
disclosure regulations are codified at 24 CFR part 35, subpart A.  Subparts B through R of 24 CFR part 
35 are known as the ‘‘Lead Safe Housing Rule,’’ initially promulgated on September 15, 1999, and 
updated in June 2004 (HUD 2004b).  This rule was designed to protect young children from lead-based 
paint hazards in target housing that is being sold by the Federal government or receives financial 
assistance from the government.  The requirements generally depend upon the level of assistance being 
provided, and may include such things as inspections, risk assessments, abatement, paint stabilization, or 
interim controls, which are temporary measures to reduce potential exposure to lead-based paint hazards. 
The emphasis is on reducing lead-based paint hazards, so, after paint is disturbed, a visual assessment for 
surface dust, debris, and residue and dust clearance testing is required to ensure that no dust lead hazards 
were created or left in the work area or, for rehabilitation projects of moderate or substantial scope, in the 
entire housing unit.  More information on the Lead Safe Housing Rule is available on the HUD website at 
http://www.hud.gov/offices/lead.  
Section 1017 of Title X required HUD to issue ‘‘guidelines for the conduct of federally supported work 
involving risk assessments, inspections, interim controls, and abatement of lead-based paint hazards.’’ In 
response to this directive, HUD completed the Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based 
Paint Hazards in Housing (Guidelines), in June 1995 (HUD 1995).  The Guidelines provide detailed, 
comprehensive, technical information on how to identify lead-based paint hazards in housing and how to 
control such hazards safely and efficiently. 
Other core activities of HUD’s lead-based paint program include providing technical assistance to 
housing authorities, nonprofit housing providers, local and State agencies, other Federal agencies, housing 
developers, inspectors, real estate professionals, contractors and financiers, and public health authorities; 
evaluating the hazard reduction methods used in the grant program to measure their effectiveness, cost 
and safety; and maintaining a community outreach program in coordination with the other Federal 
agencies involved in lead-based paint hazard reduction.  
CDC also provides significant funding for the prevention of childhood lead poisoning.  CDC provides 
funding to support State, city and county programs in the areas of primary prevention, case management 
and screening, surveillance, strategic partnerships, and program evaluation.  Since 2002, CDC has 
recommended that a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL) be used as a threshold for 
individual intervention (CDC 2002).  Additional CDC recommendations address the type and intensity of 
individual intervention strategies that should be undertaken, depending upon the child’s blood lead level. 
These strategies range from nutritional and educational interventions, along with more frequent testing, 
for a child with a blood lead level of 10–14 µg/dL, to medical and environmental interventions for 
children with blood lead levels above 45 µg/dL (CDC 2002).  CDC has established a national surveillance 
system for children with elevated blood lead levels.  In addition, CDC works with HUD and EPA to 
coordinate outreach and education campaigns. 
OSHA is another agency with regulatory authority under Title X.  As directed by the Act, OSHA 
promulgated an interim final standard on May 4, 1993, which regulates lead exposures in the construction 
industry (OSHA 1993).  This standard, codified at 29 CFR 1926.62, limits worker exposures to 50 
micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air averaged over an 8–hour workday.  Employers must use a 
combination of engineering controls and work practices to reduce employee exposure as much as 
possible, using appropriate respiratory protection where necessary to achieve the exposure limit. 
Employees must receive training on the health effects of lead and how to limit exposure through proper 
work practices and personal protective equipment.  Exposure monitoring and medical monitoring, 
including blood lead testing, are also required. This standard remains in effect and OSHA retains the 
authority to protect workers from occupational exposure to lead. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-11 
Many Federal agencies have been working to reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards in housing and 
to end lead poisoning.  EPA, HUD, and other Federal agencies have been working for many years on the 
problem of lead-based paint hazards that can be created during renovation and remodeling activities in 
housing and child-occupied facilities.  This rulemaking is an important component of the Federal strategy 
for eliminating lead poisoning. 
3.3 Justification for Federal Regulations of Lead Exposure during Renovation 
3.3.1 Market Failure 
Market failure is one of the conditions that can justify government regulation.  Market failures can result 
when one or more of the following conditions are met: 
• poorly defined property rights (such as negative externalities, common property resources, and 
public goods);  
• imperfect markets for trading property rights (because of a lack of perfect information or of 
contingent markets;  
• monopoly power;  
• distortionary taxes and subsidies and other inappropriate government regulations); and  
• the divergence of private and social discount rates. 
The occurrence of any of these conditions justifies further inquiry into the need for government regulation 
to reduce inefficiencies in the allocation of society’s resources.  This section considers whether any of 
these conditions are linked to lead exposures resulting from renovation in target housing and public or 
commercial building COFs.  If so, understanding the nature of the inefficiencies involved facilitates the 
design of more effective regulations.  The specific regulatory approach considered here involves requiring 
dust sampling and clearance testing following certain renovation activities.   
Economic efficiency suggests that in the absence of regulation dust sampling and clearance testing 
following renovation will occur as long as the property owners’ willingness-to-pay for reduced lead risks 
exceeds the cost of reducing these risks.  If the property owners are aware of the risks and of the 
availability and costs of reducing these risks, then arguably they might be able to accurately trade off risk 
and cost without the aid of government regulation.  However, there are two arguments for why individual 
property owners may not trade off risk and cost efficiently: (1) because externalities exist, and (2) because 
of inadequate information. 
Externalities and Public-Good Characteristics of Lead-Safe Renovation  
One potential cause of market failure for dust sampling and clearance testing following renovations stems 
from externalities.  An efficient outcome is achieved when the marginal willingness-to-pay for a service is 
equivalent to the marginal cost of providing that service.  In the case of renovation in a rental unit, the 
primary beneficiaries of lead-safe renovation are the occupants; however, the decision about whether or 
not to pay for dust sampling or clearance testing is made by the property owners or managers who have 
an insufficient incentive to take the benefits to their occupants into account when making this decision.  
Externalities also exist in the case of renovation events in owner-occupied homes.  Because dust sampling 
and clearance testing following renovation in an owner-occupied unit is likely to benefit not only the 
consumer of the renovation (the homeowner and his or her family members) but also residents of adjacent 
properties, future occupants, visitors, and children receiving child care on the premises; lead-safe 
renovation services are, in part, a public good.  As such, even with perfect information, the maximum 
amount that the individual consumer of the renovation would be willing to pay for lead-safe work is likely 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-12 
to be lower than the total amount that that particular consumer plus the other beneficiaries (tenants, 
neighbors, future occupants, etc.) would be willing-to-pay for the service.  For example, a future occupant 
of a housing unit for sale may experience an increased exposure to lead if a renovation that creates a lead 
hazard is performed before they move in.  While a future occupant might be willing to pay to reduce or 
eliminate this exposure, they would not be consulted by the property owner making the decision.  As 
another example, children cannot express their willingness-to-pay for risk reduction and rely on their 
parents’ or the property owners’ willingness-to-pay.  Even if other parties were consulted, the transaction 
costs of reaching an agreement would be high, leading to an inefficient process. 
Another example of an externality is associated with an owner’s decision regarding which contractor to 
hire to perform renovation in his or her housing unit.  Contractors that perform dust sampling or clearance 
testing following a renovation are likely to charge more for their work than establishments that do not 
perform this testing.  This testing may also increase the duration of the project because dust wipe testing 
takes time, and because contractors may need to perform additional cleaning.  Since the property owner 
pays for the renovation, but not necessarily for the consequences of all the resulting lead exposure, he or 
she is faced with powerful short-term incentives (lower cost and a faster turn-around) to hire a contractor 
that does not perform dust sampling or clearance testing.  Other parties (such as tenants, future occupants, 
visitors, and children receiving child care and their parents) pay for the consequences of lead exposures, 
not the property owner.  This externality results in the socially inefficient outcome of too little dust 
sampling and clearance testing services being purchased. 
Inefficiencies also exist on the supply side of this market.  Renovators that perform dust sampling or 
clearance testing incur higher costs than other contractors who are faced with incentives to keep their 
costs as low as possible.  Similar to property owners, contractors may not incur the costs of consumer 
lead exposure resulting from unsafe renovation work.   
Because the legal system is not perfect, the contractor’s financial responsibilities (in terms of liability 
costs related to customer lead exposure) are not clear and consistently enforced.  The same situation 
occurs with respect to a property owner’s responsibilities to tenants, future occupants, visitors, and child-
care customers.  This situation is likely to result in an inefficient outcome of too little dust sampling and 
clearance testing services being consumed.   
Inadequate Information 
Another cause of market failure associated wth lead-safe work practices is due to inadequate information.  
Correct information is an important prerequisite to the demand for dust sampling or clearance testing 
following renovation projects.  In deciding whether dust sampling or clearance testing are worth the extra 
cost, the property owner must know whether there is lead in the work area, what risks are implied by 
having renovation done in areas with lead-based paint, the significance of these risks, what can be 
accomplished in reducing those risks, and how much these risk reductions cost. On the supply side, 
contractors may be unaware of the risks they are creating. 
Misinformation can lead to inefficient outcomes.  Without knowing there is a lead problem, or how 
renovation might create lead hazards, the owner will have too low a demand for dust sampling or 
clearance testing and may be unwilling to pay additional costs for contractors to perform the testing.  
Furthermore, a great deal of uncertainty can exist if the consumer is unsure about the quality of lead-safe 
renovation services being purchased and their likely benefits.  If consumers do not have any guarantee 
that contractors are qualified to identify and control lead-based paint hazards, demand for these services is 
likely to be lower than in the presence of such a guarantee.  Under the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
additional information will be available to property owners on the effectiveness of prospective contractors 
at minimizing risks from lead-based paint hazards.  Specifically, property owners will be able to judge the 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-13 
past performance of contractors through referrals from family, friends and neighbors, by checking 
references, and by reading contractor reviews available through online contractor referral websites.  As a 
result of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule, demand is likely to increase for those contractors who 
develop reputations for completing renovation work without leaving high levels of lead dust behind.  
Customer satisfaction is particularly important for the renovation industry, an industry where most firms 
report that over 50 percent of revenues are attributable to referrals and some firms report that up to 90 
percent of their revenues are attributable to referrals (NARI, undated).  Furthermore, if individual 
consumers are satisfied with a contractor’s work, they are more likely to hire that same contractor for 
additional work in the future.  If a contractor leaves behind high dust levels, the consumer may choose to 
hire a different contractor for future work.  
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule provides additional information to two groups: (1) renovation firms 
and their employees, and (2) owners and occupants of renovated structures.  The proposed rule will 
provide additional information to renovation firms and their employees about the effectiveness of the 
containment and cleaning practices they are employing. Specifically, dust wipe test results that exceed 
dust hazard levels indicate that the containment and cleaning practices employed were inadequate while 
results showing no dust-lead hazards indicate that the containment and cleaning practices employed were 
adequate.  Renovation firms can be expected to improve their effectiveness and efficiency for achieving 
dust wipe test results below dust-lead hazard levels as they receive feedback on the effectiveness of their 
work practices.   
Property owners and occupants will also be provided with additional information under the proposed rule. 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule will enhance a consumer’s ability to select a renovation firm with a 
record of achieving low dust-lead levels.  For example, potential renovation consumers would be able to 
ask renovation firm references or the firms themselves about their record for achieving low dust-lead 
levels dust wipe test results, as demonstrated by dust wipe test results.  After the work is completed 
property owners and occupants will be provided information about dust-lead levels after renovation work 
has been performed.  This information will provide owners and occupants with a greater understanding 
and awareness of dust-lead levels, which has value because it provides owners and occupants with a 
greater ability to make further risk management decisions.  In addition, owners and occupants are more 
likely to provide positive referrals for those contractors that completed the work without leaving behind 
high levels of lead dust, creating extra incentives for renovation firms to minimize lead dust levels. 
Impacts of the Regulation on Demand for Lead-Safe Renovation Services 
A consumer’s demand for renovation services is a function of the price of these services, the 
characteristics of the services (e.g., quality, lead safety etc.), and consumers’ own characteristics.  For the 
purpose of illustration, assume that all renovation services are identical except that some are performed 
using lead-safe containment and clean-up practices with dust sampling and some are not.  Further assume 
that there is only one consumer and one supplier in the market.  Of the services that are performed 
without lead-safe practices, some are done by the supplier, while others are do-it-yourself projects 
performed by the consumer.  The general market failure relationships discussed above are illustrated in 
Exhibit 3-1 as three markets for close substitutes.  Figure (a) represents the market for lead-safe 
renovation projects, Figure (b) represents the professional market for “standard practice” renovations that 
do not use lead-safe work practices, and Figure (c) represents the do-it-yourself market for “standard 
practice” renovations.  In each market, S0 represents the supply of renovation services and D0 represents 
the demand for renovation services in the baseline with incomplete information.  Note that, moving from 
left to right, each supply curve is lower than the prior one, corresponding to the lower cost in terms of 
materials and time combined.  The area under the demand curve in each market represents the consumer’s 
willingness-to-pay for renovation services.

The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule alters the nature of these three markets by providing additional 
information to the consumer and contractor about the risk associated with lead-based paint renovation 
activities and by requiring that clearance standards are met following certain renovations.  The 
implementation of the LRRP program will help to establish a more structured market for lead-safe 
renovation services.  Prior to April 2010 when the LRRP program first took effect, consumers of 
renovation services generally had no guarantee that a contractor who claimed to provide lead-safe 
renovation services would actually perform the project in a lead-safe manner.  The 2008 LRRP rule, 
which is now part of the baseline for the renovation industry, provides some assurance to consumers 
about the quality of work provided by certified renovators, through the implementation of work practice 
standards and training/certification requirements.  The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule builds on the 2008 
rule to provide additional assurances to consumers about the quality of work provided by certified 
renovators, by providing quantitative information on the lead dust levels they leave behind. 
EPA’s targeted outreach program is also likely to increase demand for lead-safe renovation services by 
raising consumer awareness about the dangers of unsafe work.  Thus, demand for lead-safe renovation 
activities may shift with EPA’s outreach campaign or due to the provision of information about lead 
hazards and risks before a consumer sign a contract with a renovator. 
Although contractors that currently provide well-trained staff and perform lead-safe work practices are 
expected to find it in their vested interest to provide the kinds of information cited above, this possibility 
has not closed the information gaps for the public.  One impediment may be public uncertainty about the 
reliability of information that contractors themselves provide in the absence of the proposed LRRP 
Clearance Rule.  Their information may be considered unreliable because consumers are not fully 
competent to assess the lead contamination and what needs to be done, because the businesses are subject 
to moral hazard (which occurs, for example, because businesses have a financial interest in minimizing 
their work practice costs), or both.  Since many property owners may lack easy access to independent 
sources of information to motivate their decisions, doing nothing may be the likely response.  The 
 Chapter 3 3-14 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-15 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule aims to reduce public uncertainty by providing quantitative information 
to consumers about prospective renovation firms’ abilities to minimize dust lead levels.  For example, 
before hiring a contractor a consumer can ask firm references or the firms themselves to provide 
information about their past performance in minimizing post-verification dust-lead levels.  Consumers 
and firms might also choose to set contract terms or prices that are contingent on the post-verification 
dust-lead levels, reducing renovation firms’ incentives to lower work practice costs in a manner that 
might increase the likelihood of leaving a dust lead hazard behind.   
The increased demand discussed above is shown by an upward shift of the demand curve in Figure (a) 
from D0 to D1 and an associated increase in price.  Simultaneously, the demand for “standard practice” 
renovation services decreases with an associated decrease in price.   Given scarce resources for 
enforcement, it is expected that some “standard practice” professional work will continue, even in 
properties where there is the potential for lead exposure.  The effect of the regulation on the do-it-yourself 
market is ambiguous.  Some property owners that might have hired a professional to perform “standard 
practice” renovation work in the baseline may decide to perform this work themselves rather than pay the 
additional costs for lead-safe work practices.  This action would shift the supply curve back up.  On the 
other hand, with increased information, property owners that would have performed do-it-yourself 
“standard” practice” renovation in the baseline may decide to either forgo renovation altogether or hire a 
lead-safe professional, thus reducing do-it-yourself demand. 
Impacts of the Regulation on the Supply of Lead-Safe Renovation Services 
The proposed LRRP clearance rule will increase both the cost of supplying lead-safe services and 
standard services.   In Figures (a) and (b), S1 represents the supply of services with the regulations.  Many 
firms performing lead-safe renovations will incur additional costs associated with having third party dust 
sampling performed (or training dust sampling technicians and performing their own dust sampling), and 
may incur costs for re-cleaning where clearance is required. A contractor that continues to provide 
standard (not lead-safe) renovation services will have higher costs of operation due to potential 
enforcement actions and potentially higher liability.  The relative size of the shifts in the two submarkets 
will affect the final changes in quantity and price of both lead-safe and standard renovation services. 
The net impact on the quantity of renovation projects performed is also ambiguous.  If all property owners 
are willing to pay the full amount for lead-safe work practices, then the total quantity performed across all 
three markets will remain constant but the average price will rise.  However, if some property owners are 
not willing to pay for the risk reduction they may chose to forgo renovation services altogether, resulting 
in a net decline in renovation services provided after regulation.1 
Conclusions 
As demonstrated in this section, due to inadequate information and the existence of externalities, the 
quantity of lead-safe RRP services currently provided is likely to be inefficiently low.  Failure in the 
market for lead-safe RRP services is significant in both qualitative and quantitative terms.  Childhood 
lead exposure continues to be a major public health problem among young children in the United States.  
From 1999 to 2002, approximately 310,000 children aged 1 to 5 years, had blood-lead levels greater than 
10 μg/dL, despite the removal of lead from gasoline and a ban on  lead-based paint in 1978 (CDC 2005).  
Most children with blood-lead levels in excess of CDC’s current level of concern have been exposed to 
                                                          
1 The amount by which price and quantity change in each of these markets is a function of both the amount by which 
the supply and/or demand functions shift and the relative elasticities of the two functions.  See Appendix 3A for 
a discussion of how these factors affect the price of renovation services and the quantity provided by the 
market.  Appendix 3B presents price elasticity estimates for construction and RRP.

lead in non-intact paint, interior settled dust, and dust and soil in and around deteriorating older housing 
or other buildings where they spend time.  According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), 
“renovation and remodeling activities that disturb lead-based paint can create substantial amounts of lead 
dust in the home; such dust can then be inhaled or ingested by children” (CDC 1997).  An insufficient 
number of lead-based paint interventions have occurred to remove the dangers posed by uncontrolled 
renovation activities; renovation activity thus continues to pose a significant risk of lead exposure. 
3.3.2 Justification for Regulation at the Federal Level 
In the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X), the United States Congress 
stated that the elimination of lead-based paint hazards was a national goal.  Under §402, Congress 
directed EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals 
are properly trained, that training programs are accredited, and that contractors engaged in such activities 
are certified; and to promulgate guidelines for the conduct of such renovation and remodeling activities 
which may create a risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead.  Accordingly, the 2008 LRRP rule 
established training, certification and accreditation requirements as well as work practice requirements for 
renovation work in target housing and COFs. 
The proposed rule revises the LRRP program by requiring dust wipe testing and clearance testing 
following certain renovations.  Since both of these provisions revise the existing Federal RRP regulation, 
it is appropriate that the changes be made at the Federal level, instead of the state or local level. 
3.4 Approaches for Reducing Lead Exposure Resulting from Renovation 
This section examines how the information provision and the mandatory training and work practice 
requirements in the proposed rule address the market failures discussed in the previous section.   
3.4.1 Information Provision 
Information provision will occur in several ways under the LRRP program in conjunction with other 
sections of Title X.  Consumers will be directly informed about lead-based paint hazards and risks 
associated with renovation work through educational programs, expanded notification requirements, and 
quantitative information about dust-lead hazards provided after dust wipe testing and clearance.  The aim 
of these programs will be to educate the property owner about the risks associated with lead-based paint 
and lead-based paint hazards and having renovation work done in areas where these are present, the 
significance of these risks, and how specific work practices can reduce those risks.  In addition, requiring 
training of professionals who carry out renovation projects and perform dust wipe testing will provide 
these individuals information about the hazards of lead exposure and the use of appropriate procedures to 
reduce exposure during their work.  Similarly, the firm certification process will act as an indirect form of 
information provision to the consumer by assuring them that the services they are purchasing will reduce 
or eliminate lead exposure. 
The proposed rule addresses market failure due to inadequate information in two ways.  First, it will 
enable consumers to more accurately judge the qualifications of renovation firms before entering into a 
contract because of additional information that will be available as a result of the rule.  In addition, they 
will have more complete information about the quality of the work that was performed at the completion 
of the job. Owners and occupants who have more complete information about dust lead standards will 
have an enhanced ability to make further risk management decisions.  Second, it provides a feedback 
mechanism for renovation firms that is expected to result in improvements in the effectiveness and 
efficiency of their containment and cleaning practices. Both of these information provision activities are 
described below. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-17 
Effect of Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Requirements 
The objective of requiring dust wipe testing and clearance following certain renovations is to reduce 
exposure to lead dust generated by renovation projects and thereby protect children and adults from the 
health hazards posed by lead.  Due to the nature of the problem, uncertainty currently exists on the part of 
consumers about the quality of lead-safe renovation services and their likely benefits.  The lack of 
information regarding the benefits of and the lack of confidence in the quality of a good or service 
generally leads to a lower demand and a lower willingness-to-pay for that good or service.  Thus, if 
consumers of renovation services are not aware of the dangers posed by lead dust generated during 
renovation, or if they are not confident that a contractor who claims to use lead-safe work practices has 
been properly trained, they may not be willing to pay the additional costs of contractors who voluntarily 
abide by these work practice standards.  Requiring dust wipe testing and clearance following renovations 
will provide consumers with more complete information about the effectiveness of the lead safe work 
practices that were used. Under the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule additional information will be 
available to property owners on the effectiveness of prospective contractors at minimizing risks from 
lead-based paint hazards.  Specifically, property owners will be able to judge the past performance of 
contractors through referrals from family, friends and neighbors, by checking references, and by reading 
contractor reviews available through online contractor referral websites.  As a result of the proposed 
LRRP Clearance Rule, demand is likely to increase for those contractors who develop reputations for 
completing renovation work without leaving high levels of lead dust behind.  Customer satisfaction is 
particularly important for the renovation industry, an industry where most firms report that over 50 
percent of revenues are attributable to referrals and some firms report that up to 90 percent of their 
revenues are attributable to referrals (NARI, undated). In addition, renovation consumers and firms would 
have the option to set contract terms or prices that are contingent on the dust wipe test results at the end of 
a job. An example of the market failure stemming from inadequate information is presented in the 
previous section and is shown graphically in Exhibit 3-1. 
The proposed rule will provide additional information to renovation firms and their employees about the 
effectiveness of the containment and cleaning practices that they are employing.  This feedback 
mechanism is likely to result in more effective and efficient containment and cleaning practices. 
If renovators were not mandated to provide this information to consumers, responsible renovators might 
theoretically provide it voluntarily (although renovators who are not as responsible are unlikely to provide 
this information voluntarily).  But there is no evidence that even responsible renovators are doing this.  
The failure of the marketplace to provide this information on its own means that owners and occupants 
may not be able to react appropriately to avoid or prevent risks from lead-based paint. 
3.4.2 Mandatory Training and Work Practice Requirements 
The information provision described above will aid in reducing the extent of the market failure that 
currently exists for lead-safe renovation services.  However, relying solely on information provision is 
unlikely to be sufficient to correct the market failure because of the nature of the lead paint problem.  The 
lead in lead-based paint cannot be seen on visual inspection, therefore, the owner and occupant do not 
know if lead is present and whether a lead exposure hazard exists.  Likewise, the adverse health effects 
are not noticeable for several years and the source may not be recognized.  In such situations, education 
may not be sufficient and other mechanisms are needed to ensure that if a potential risk exists, it is 
suitably addressed.  The LRRP program introduces other mechanisms for the elimination of lead-based 
paint hazards during renovation work.  These include training requirements for personnel engaged in 
renovation work, dust wipe testing, and clearance.  Work practice requirements include the use of 
standard practices for the containment and cleanup of lead dust and debris generated during the project,

 Chapter 3 3-18 
the prohibition or restriction of certain high-hazard techniques, and the use of standard requirements for 
performing dust wipe sampling and clearance.

 Chapter 3 3-19 
Appendix 3A:  The Role of Elasticities in Determining the Impacts of a 
Rule 
EPA is often faced with deciding on a regulatory policy in the absence of good information about the 
likely effects of the policy on consumers and producers.  In particular, data on the own-price elasticity of 
supply and demand often are uncertain.  This appendix provides background information on the likely 
effects of own-price elasticity of demand and supply on the outcomes of EPA’s regulatory efforts.  The 
bulk of the discussion focuses on the case of perfect competition, not because the majority of markets 
EPA is likely to affect will exhibit competitive behavior, but simply because the theory is clearly defined 
in this case.  However, this appendix also examines the likely impacts of relaxing the assumption of 
perfect competition.  It focuses on two general classes of regulatory options: regulations that alter the 
market outcome by imposing additional costs upon producers, and regulations that alter the market by 
providing information to consumers. 
3A.1  Elasticities of Supply and Demand 
The market equilibrium for a commodity (e.g., purchasing renovation, remodeling or painting (RRP) 
work that uses lead-safe work practices) is determined by the intersection of the aggregate demand and 
supply curves. The aggregate demand curve depicts consumer behavior and is based on consumer income 
and preferences. Likewise, the aggregate supply curve describes the behavior of producers in the market, 
and is dependent upon the costs of production. At market equilibrium, the price is referred to as market 
clearing.  In other words, at this price, the quantity demanded by consumers and supplied by producers 
are equal and neither the consumer nor producer has any incentive to move away from this steady state as 
long as current demand and supply conditions prevail. 
However, when demand and supply conditions do change, for example when new information causes 
consumers to adjust their preferences and thus shift the demand curve, or changes in input prices affect 
costs of production and shift the supply curve, the market gravitates to a new equilibrium. This new 
equilibrium is represented by a new combination of market clearing price and quantity.  The magnitude of 
the change in price and quantity is dependent not only upon the extent of the shift in the demand or supply 
curve, but also on the own-price elasticity of demand and supply for the commodity. 
The own-price elasticity of demand is defined as the ratio of the percent change in quantity demanded to 
the percent change in price, and is reflected in the slope of the demand curve, similarly for the own-price 
elasticity of supply.  By determining the level of change in price and quantity, the elasticities of the two 
curves also determine the distribution of the burden or benefit between the consumer and producer 
resulting from a change in equilibrium conditions. Analyzing changes in consumer and producer 
surpluses provides a means for quantifying such distributional changes. 
Figure 3A-1 below provides a hypothetical example of how the effects of regulation may impact 
consumer and producer surpluses. In the baseline, the supply curve is represented by S1, and producers 
supply Q1 at a price P1.  On all the inframarginal units supplied, producers receive a price above the cost 
of production.  The difference between the price and the cost of production represents the producer 
surplus resulting from supplying Q1 at price P1 (triangle P1CD).  Similarly, in the baseline consumers 
demand quantity Q1 at price P1.  For all the inframarginal units demanded, consumers would be willing to 
pay more than that price and thus receive a surplus.  The difference between what consumers are willing 
to pay as measured by the height of the demand curve, and what they have to pay is the consumer surplus 
(triangle ACP1). 
So what are the effects of regulation?  In Figure 3A-1, the upward shift in the supply curve to S2 (say 
from a rise in production costs due to the implementation of the RRP rule which requires use of the more 
costly lead-safe work practices) results in a new equilibrium at the point B, with a new market price of P2 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
and quantity of Q2.  Note that producer surplus decreases from P1CD to EBP2 and the consumer surplus 
also decreases from ACP1 to ABP2. Thus, in the arbitrary case drawn in Figure 3A-1, the social costs of 
the regulation are born by both consumers and producers of the pollution-generating good. This result 
turns out to be a function of the way the supply and demand curves have been drawn, and the distribution 
of costs between consumers and producers depends on the slope (elasticity) of the demand and supply 
curves.

In general, for a given production cost increase, the more elastic the demand curve, the greater the 
inability on the part of the producers to pass the additional costs of production on to the consumers.  As 
shown in Figure 3A-2 (a) and 3A-2 (b) below, the differing slopes of the demand curve lead to 
differential impacts on the consumer and producer surplus. In Figure 3A-2 (a) demand for the good is 
relatively price elastic, while in Figure 3A-2 (b) the good has a relatively inelastic demand.   Notice that 
when demand is less elastic, the price increase resulting from a shift in supply is greater and consumers 
bear a greater share of the loss in consumer surplus.  On the other hand, with a more elastic demand, the 
overall price increase is smaller and the share of total costs born by producers is larger.

The elasticity of demand is determined in general by the existence of suitable substitutes for a 
commodity. If several commodities exist in the market that are considered to be close substitutes for each 
other, then a consumer is likely to have a great deal of choice available to him while making his 
consumption decision. This being the case, if the price of the commodity that he is presently consuming 
happens to rise, he is easily able to reduce his current consumption level of that commodity and switch 
over to consuming more of one of the substitutes. This flexibility limits the ability of the producer to pass 
on the burden of the cost increase on to the consumer. Thus, the availability of close substitutes in the 
market explains why the demand curve for a commodity will be relatively elastic, and why the rise in 
price will be relatively small. On the other hand, if substitutes are lacking for a commodity that 
experiences a price increase (and it is not a luxury good), then the consumer has little choice but to carry 
on consuming similar quantities of the same product. Thus, in this situation he will have to shoulder a 
larger share of the increased costs by paying a much higher price, and this rigidity in his consumption 
behavior explains the inelastic nature of the demand curve for that commodity. 
Recognizing that most markets are not perfectly competitive, product differentiation allows firms to 
charge prices higher than marginal costs and charge different prices for similar goods.  The degree to 
which producers can pass on the cost of production depends heavily on the degree to which they can 
convince consumers that their product is different from other products.  In its limit this argument is just a 
restatement of the fact that markets with lower elasticities of demand will experience higher price 
increases.  If “market demand” is defined to be the demand for a single brand of good, then the number of 
substitutes for the good affects its demand elasticity and thus affects the degree to which the producer can 
pass on cost increases.  If the firm can convince consumers that the product is distinct then it in essence 
lowers the elasticity of demand for its product. 
The own price elasticity of supply, on the other hand, is dependent on the degree of specialization of 
inputs.   If the inputs are highly specialized or firms are locked into long-term contracts then firms in this 
industry can be left with substantial sunk investments creating high transition costs which are reflected in 
an inelastic supply curve. However, if supply is highly elastic then firms can easily switch production to

other uses and minimize the effect of the demand shock.  In essence the elasticity of supply measures the 
amount of resources lost or tied up indefinitely when consumption patterns change suddenly. 
The EPA seeks to reduce hazards from lead-based paint by two separate pathways of regulatory impact. 
First, it hopes to reduce exposure to lead-based paint by regulating the “method of production” of RRP 
work in opt-out housing by establishing standards for such activities and through requiring certifications 
and/or training. This is likely to result in an increase in the “costs of production” of RRP work thereby 
affecting the supply curve for such activities. Second, the rule will provide information to consumers.  In 
this case EPA is likely to alter the market outcomes by changing the demand for products (lead-safe and 
non lead-safe work practices). To the extent that the demand and supply of RRP work will be affected by 
the rule, one must consider the price elasticities involved to determine the distributive impact of the rule 
on consumers and producers. 
An important factor on which the price elasticity will depend is the number of substitutes that exist for the 
RRP service that is sought in the market. As previously explained, the greater the number of available 
substitutes, the more elastic the demand and lesser the burden of a production cost increase likely to fall 
on the consumer.  Under this rule three classes of substitutes may be said to exist for RRP services. These 
are (1) professionals using lead-safe work practices, (2) professionals using non lead-safe work practices, 
and (3) the do-it-yourself jobs. Thus, a certain amount of flexibility is available to the consumer when it 
comes to hiring RRP services. 
Currently a sizeable number of RRP firms may not necessarily be following lead-safe work practices 
thereby limiting the size of the class of firms that do so. However, with the implementation of the rule, a 
much larger number of firms are expected to adhere to these practices in the future, thus enlarging the size 
of this class.  In addition, this increase in the number of professionals using lead-safe work practices will 
also have a geographical impact. Presently, the limited number of professionals who use lead-safe work 
practices are concentrated in a select number of locations where state and local regulations have fostered 
their development. As a result, in many parts of the country the choice of hiring “lead-safe” professionals 
currently does not exist. But this situation will change as a larger number of firms switch to lead-safe 
work practices once the rule come into effect. 
However, if the increase in production costs from the rule is extremely high such a large transition of 
firms from using lead-unsafe to lead-safe work practices may not occur. This is because the cheaper 
option of using non-certified (non lead-safe work practice using) RRP workers or doing the work yourself 
will limit the ability of the certified (lead-safe work practice using) professional to charge the consumer 
for all or a large portion of this significant cost increase. In this situation a large number of lead-unsafe 
firms may remain in existence.  Thus, one may assume that as long as an appreciable difference exists 
between “costs of production” of lead-safe and non lead-safe work practices, firms of both types will 
continue to exist.  The continued existence of firms using non lead-safe practices also depends on the 
extent and effectiveness of enforcement activities.  The greater the cost differential between lead-safe and 
non lead-safe practices, the greater the need for enforcement activities. 
In addition to the number of substitutes, the closeness of substitutes in their ability to replace one another 
needs to be judged. The important question is whether RRP work done by uncertified professionals and 
the do-it-yourself efforts are substantially less safe than the services of certified professionals. To the 
extent an appreciable difference exists between the quality of service (in terms of preventing or reducing 
lead-based paint hazards) provided by the two groups, they will not be perceived as close substitutes for 
each other and their demand curves will not be as elastic as they would have been if they were considered 
close substitutes. In such a situation, consumers feel that a sufficiently differentiated product is being 
offered by the two groups, and thus their choice is limited. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-23 
This judgment on the degree of closeness of substitutes will to some extent depend upon the importance 
that lead safety holds with the property owner compared to other priorities. To the extent that the priority 
assigned to lead exposure is relatively small, the uncertified professionals and do-it-yourself jobs will 
tend to be seen as closer substitutes for certified professionals, than if lead-based paint hazards are 
perceived as a larger threat by the property owner. Thus, the elasticity of demand will also vary according 
to owner priorities, and in this regard, the informational aspect of the rule may in fact assist in raising 
more awareness, resulting in lead safety being assigned a higher priority. 
Of a related nature, the firm certification aspect of the rule is likely to increase consumer ability to 
differentiate between the services being offered by the three classes of substitutes. The certification 
process will create a distinct divide which will permit the property owner to get a better appreciation of 
the varied benefits to be gained from the alternatives at hand. This is likely to reduce to some extent the 
perceived closeness of the substitutes and thereby make the demand more inelastic for each class of RRP 
service.

3A.2  How Price Elasticity of Demand Affects the RRP Rule 
As discussed above, EPA foresees two separate pathways by which the rule will take effect; increasing 
costs of production leading to a shift in supply and provision of information to consumers leading to a 
shift in demand. The way these two effects will play out and the role that price elasticities will play in the 
adjustment of prices and quantities under the two scenarios is discussed below. 
3A.2.1   Effect of Rule on the Cost of Production (Supply Shift) 
EPA seeks to reduce exposure to lead-based paint hazards by the introduction of lead-safe work practices 
during RRP work. These practices involve the use of increased precautions in situations where lead-based 
paint hazards may potentially be created during RRP work, and as a result costs of RRP work are likely to 
increase above current levels. Since producers seek to maximize profits and in the baseline will produce 
goods using the lowest-cost combination of inputs, a rule requiring producers to change their input mix 
will necessarily increase the cost of production. Thus, one impact of the rule will be to increase the 
production costs, leading the supply curve to shift upward and to the left. 
Figures 3A-2(a) and 3A-2(b) demonstrate the distributional affects of such a hypothetical shift in supply 
in markets with different elasticities of demand.  The price increase is much higher (P1 to P2) and the 
decrease in quantity demanded is much lower (Q1 to Q2) with a given shift in supply when demand is 
less elastic (as shown in Figure 3A-2(b)) as compared to the elastic demand scenario in Figure 3A-2(a).  
Thus, the consumers bear a higher share of the total social cost from the regulation (represented by the 
relatively larger decrease in the consumer surplus compared to that in the producer surplus). On the other 
hand, Figure 3A-2(a) shows that the higher the elasticity of demand, the lower the overall price increase, 
the larger the reduction in quantity demanded, and thus the larger the share of total costs to be born by 
producers (represented similarly by the larger decrease in producer surplus as compared to the consumer 
surplus). 
3A.2.2 Effect of Rule on the Provision of Information to Consumers (Demand Shift) 
The alternative regulatory approach is to provide information to consumers in the hopes that they will 
make more environmentally friendly consumption choices.  In this case EPA alters the market outcomes 
by changing the demand for products.  Figures 3A-3(a) and 3A-3(b) depict such a hypothetical example.  
In these cases the commodity in question (non lead-safe work practices) has negative environmental 
effects (byproducts).  By educating consumers about these byproducts and alternative products that have 
lower levels of adverse effects (lead-safe work practices), EPA can change consumer preferences and 
shift demand for the “bad product” inward and to the left.  This lower demand curve would more 
accurately reflect the true “social” marginal benefits of consuming the product. 
What are the likely distributional and efficiency effects of this type of regulatory policy? Figures 3A-3(a) 
and 3A-3(b) reveal that under both scenarios (for an elastic and inelastic supply curve), the downward 
shift in the demand curve will lead to a decrease in price and quantity demanded of the commodity. 
However, in the case of an elastic supply curve when the transition costs associated with switching to the 
production of other products is relatively low, the decrease in price of the commodity is smaller and the 
decrease in quantity demanded larger, as compared to the changes in the case of an inelastic supply curve 
involving high transition costs. Restated in terms of changes in producer and consumer surpluses, the 
producer surplus is reduced under each scenario, but the elastic supply curve causes a relatively smaller 
burden to fall on the producer than the inelastic supply curve. Similarly, the consumer receives a 
reduction in social benefit under each scenario; however, the magnitude of this reduction is larger under 
the inelastic supply curve case.

3A.2.3  Application to Renovation 
In the rule, EPA is both affecting production and providing information.  The likely effects of the 
regulation on prices and welfare are difficult to discuss without more accurate information on the supply 
and demand elasticities.  However, some general observations are warranted. 
The welfare effects of the regulation will likely be driven by the supply side rather than the demand side.  
This is because the elasticity of supply for RRP services is likely to be relatively higher than the elasticity 
of demand.  Supply elasticities are expected to be relatively high because there are relatively few barriers 
to entering or leaving this industry.  Little capital equipment or specialized labor skills are needed for 
RRP work, and what is needed is easily transferred from non-compliant renovation to “lead-safe” 
projects.  On the demand side, there are two primary categories of RRP events – those of a maintenance 
character and those of an improvement character.  Maintenance activities usually cannot be postponed 
and thus are not particularly sensitive to price.  Improvement projects, however, can more easily be 
postponed and thus tend to be more price elastic.  Complicating matters, however, are the existence of 
different categories of purchasers.  Some place a high premium on quality and timeliness, while others 
actively seek low prices.  Appendix 3B discusses some of the empirical evidence on elasticities of 
demand and supply. 
However, the analysis does not suggest that the education factor is unimportant.  If the regulation is not 
accompanied by education efforts and enforcement, then EPA could unintentionally drive up demand for 
non-compliant renovation projects creating additional welfare losses.  These losses are the result of the 
fact that if consumers were aware of the lead paint issues their true marginal valuation for the non-
compliant projects is lower than the price of these projects.  Thus, if enforcement is not perfect, education 
is essential.  EPA can compensate for the fact that it is raising the costs of lead-free renovation on the 
supply side by educating consumers on the environmental effects of non-compliant renovations thereby 
making these cheaper, non-compliant projects less attractive.

Appendix 3B:  Elasticities of Demand and Supply for Housing / 
Renovation Services  
As described in Chapter 3 and Appendix 3A, the impact of increases in the cost of RRP services on 
demand for RRP will depend on both the size of the cost increase and the elasticity of demand for these 
services.  Likewise, the impact on the supply of RRP services will depend on both the size of the cost 
increase and the elasticity of supply for these services.  These impacts are expressed in terms of changes 
in price and in the quantity of services purchased.   Chapter 4 estimates the cost increases due to the 
requirements of the various regulatory options, based on the increased labor and materials costs of 
complying with the containment and clean-up requirements, as well as the training and certification costs 
imposed by the requirements.  This appendix reviews the existing literature on residential demand 
elasticities. 
Unfortunately, RRP has received relatively little attention by housing economists.  While there are many 
studies that estimate elasticities for new construction, these studies have only limited applicability to 
renovation and remodeling.  The income elasticity of demand for housing is generally estimated to be 
somewhat inelastic (in the 1.0 to 0.8 range).  This is consistent with housing being a necessity – 
expenditures on housing do not increase as rapidly as income (Green and Malpezzi 2003).  Demand for 
housing is also considered to be somewhat price inelastic, with generally accepted values either in the 
range of -0.5 to -1.0 or -0.75 to -1.2 (Mayo 1981, Malpezzi and Maclennan 2001, Ellwood and Polinski 
1979).  One study is available that estimated a renovation demand elasticity (Gyourko and Saiz 2003).  
This study found renovation demand to be very inelastic, with an elasticity estimated to be –0.28. 
On the other hand, housing supply appears to be very elastic – consistent with the highly competitive 
nature of the residential construction market and the large number of small contractors.  Because it is very 
easy to enter (and to leave) the construction business, supply is very responsive to changes in prices, 
especially in the long run.2  Based on the literature surveyed, estimates of housing supply elasticities tend 
to range from 1.0 to 4.0, but a couple of studies found elasticities as high as 13 or higher (DiPasquale and 
Wheaton 1994, Topel and Rosen 1988, Blackley 1999, Malpezzi and Maclennan 2001).  No elasticity 
numbers specific to the supply of renovation services could be found. 
Several characteristics of RRP tend to make its demand more price elastic than the demand for housing in 
general.  For example: 
¾ The existence of close substitutes to compliant RRP.  These substitutes include: 
à Do-It-Yourself RRP –owners of buildings may be tempted to do their own RRP work 
without proper training and certification.   
à Firms that do not complying with the regulations.  These regulations may be difficult to 
enforce against contractors, particularly the large number of small contractors who may 
be hard to identify and monitor.   
à Reductions in the scope of the projects, or postponement of the projects, to compensate 
for the price increase. Purchasers can reduce other RRP-related costs by substituting 
lower-priced fixtures/finishes and/or less extensive remodeling. 
¾ Many RRP projects are discretionary.  The price elasticity of discretionary projects is likely to be 
higher than replacement projects (e.g. new roof).  For discretionary RRP projects, it is relatively 
easy for the purchaser to reduce the scale/scope of the project, postpone the project, or never do 
it. 
                                                          
2 Note – stock adjustment models give lower elasticities than flow models.  Malpezzi and Maclennan (2001). 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 3 3-27 
Offsetting these characteristics that foster higher elasticities of demand, are ones that foster lower 
elasticities.  The major one is that the product purchased cannot be separated from the firm providing the 
product, which is true of all services.  In addition to the various RRP events analyzed in the subsequent 
chapters, RRP firms themselves are relatively differentiated.  Some firms specialize in high-end, 
complicated projects (e.g. elaborate new kitchens) while other firms specialize in performing small 
routine tasks (repainting apartments at tenant turn-over).  Some firms only work in historic or Victorian 
homes, while others will work on any type of home.  Some firms do only one type of project (e.g. 
replacing siding) while other firms will do any and all types of RRP work.  This differentiation results in 
lower demand elasticities, because producers may not be considered particularly close substitutes. 
¾ To the extent that lead-safe work can be distinguished from non-lead-safe work, a higher price 
can be charged for it. 
¾ Many contractors already employ lead-safe practices (or at least control the dispersion of dust and 
clean well before leaving).  The regulations will serve to reduce this differentiation. 
Second, the nature of RRP projects may also reduce price competition.  For relatively small jobs, property 
owners frequently will not get multiple bids – the assumed cost of the job does not warrant the effort.  In 
this case, the compliance cost can be passed on without fear of losing the work.  In the case of large jobs, 
where owners will get bids, compliance costs will make up a relatively small proportion of the total cost 
and, again, passing on the costs may be easy. 
Characteristics of the purchaser of the RRP services may also affect their demand price elasticity.  High-
income purchasers are likely to be less price sensitive than low-income purchasers.  In addition, owners of 
rental properties may be more price sensitive than owner occupants because they have different objective 
functions.  Owner-occupants operate so as to maximize their utility (their enjoyment of the house) and 
asset growth is likely to enter their decision as a secondary factor.  Owners of rental housing, on the other 
hand, are assumed to be maximizing their profits.  It is reasonable to expect that the optimal level of 
capital of an absentee landlord’s rental building is lower than that of an owner-occupier’s house, since the 
landlord’s marginal rent revenue from renovations is likely to be less than the homeowner’s marginal 
utility. 
Because of the lack of detailed price elasticity estimates for RRP, the analysis in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 does 
not incorporate any reduction in professional RRP activities in response to the cost increases resulting 
from the regulation.

4. Costs of the Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule 
Revisions 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes the following changes to the LRRP program: (1) a 
requirement to perform dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation activities, and (2) a requirement to 
perform dust wipe testing and achieve clearance for a second subset of renovation activities where the 
quantity and characteristics of the dust make it hard to clean up.  In particular, the proposed LRRP 
Clearance Rule would require dust wipe testing on uncarpeted floors and on window sills and troughs 
after the following types of renovations that disturb lead-based paint: use of a heat gun at temperatures 
below 1100 degrees Fahrenheit1; removal or replacement of window or door frames; scraping 60 ft2 or 
more of painted surfaces; or removing more than 40 ft2 of trim, molding, cabinets, or other fixtures.  
Renovations using machines that remove lead-based paint through high speed operation (such as power 
sanders or abrasive blasting), or involving demolition or removal of plaster walls with lead-based paint 
through destructive means will require firms to demonstrate – through dust wipe testing – that they have 
met clearance standards before the renovation will be considered complete. 
The costs of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule were estimated under a baseline scenario where the opt-
out provision of the 2008 LRRP rule has been eliminated, as was proposed in October 2009 (74 FR 
55506).  This choice for the baseline scenario has the advantage that the cost impacts estimated in the 
Economic Analysis of the proposed Opt-Out Rule (EPA 2009) and those estimated in this analysis can be 
added together to estimate the combined impact of both rules.2  Since the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
was developed before the LRRP Opt-Out Rule was finalized, the costs of the proposed LRRP Clearance 
Rule are also estimated for the alternative baseline scenario where the opt-out provision has not been 
eliminated (see section 4.7).   
The costs associated with the revisions to the §402(c) Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting (LRRP) 
Rule are divided into three categories for the purposes of this analysis: (1) dust wipe testing costs, (2) 
clearance costs, and (3) training costs.  The general approach of the analysis is to first estimate the 
number of affected activities or entities and then estimate the incremental regulatory cost per-activity or 
entity affected.  Next, the incremental costs and the number of affected activities and entities are 
combined to estimate the total costs.  The analysis estimates the total costs associated with the first and 
second years of regulation and then extrapolates to the costs of the regulation over a fifty year period—
estimated with three and seven percent discount rates.  See Figure 4-1 for an illustration of the general 
approach used to estimate the costs of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule. 
The cost analysis uses the results of four different surveys of fewer than 10 firms each to estimate the 
annual frequencies for the different types of events covered by the proposed rule.  The small sample sizes 
in the surveys (relative to the number of firms in the industry) may affect both the accuracy and precision 
of the estimates of the number of events requiring dust wiping or clearance, and thus the estimated cost of 
the proposed rule.  
 
                                                     
1 Under the 2008 LRRP rule at 40 CFR 745.85(a)(3)(iii), operating a heat gun on lead-based paint is permitted only at 
temperatures below 1100 degrees Fahrenheit.  
2 Note that the two analyses differ in the current dollars that are used.  In addition, both analyses use 50-year time horizons, but 
the Opt-Out analysis time period starts in 2010 and this rule’s time period starts in 2011 – in a combined analysis they would 
have the same time horizon.

 Chapter 4 4-2 
Figure 4-1: General Approach to Cost Analysis 
 
 
The chapter is organized as follows: Section 4.1 defines the regulatory options considered in this analysis; 
Section 4.2 presents estimates of the number of regulated renovation, repair, and painting events where 
dust wipe testing or clearance will be required under the various regulatory scenarios; Section 4.3 presents 
the estimated costs of performing dust wipe testing and clearance, including the associated paperwork and 
recordkeeping costs; Section 4.4 presents the estimated number of Sampling Technicians seeking training 
and certification; Section 4.5 presents the costs of training Sampling Technicians; Section 4.6 presents the 
total costs of the proposed regulatory options. Section 4.7 presents the total costs of the proposed rule 
with an alternative baseline that excludes Opt-Out housing and also presents the costs of the rule under 
additional alternative options. 
4.1 Definitions of Options 
This economic analysis considers various regulatory options.  The three primary options considered in 
this analysis only differ in the size thresholds that trigger the rule’s requirements when performing certain 
renovation activities.   The three threshold options considered in this analysis are: 
1. Low Threshold Option 
 All event types requiring dust wipe testing where the amount of lead-based paint 
disturbed is larger than 6 square feet.  
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
2. Proposed Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 40 square feet, 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-3 
- scraping of paint larger than 60 square feet, 
- heat gun removal of more than 6 square feet 
- Window frame or door frame removal events 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
3. High Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 80 square feet, 
- scraping or heat gun removal of paint larger than 120 square feet, and  
- window frame or door frame removal events. 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 60 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 60 square feet. 
 
Section 4.7 considers three alternative options in addition to the three primary options: (1) an option 
where third party dust wipe testing (including dust-wipe testing for clearance) is required; (2) an option 
that requires dust wipe testing for all of the renovation events covered by the proposed rule but does not 
require clearance for any of them; and (3) an option where clearance is required for all renovation events 
covered by the proposed rule. 
All the primary and alternative options are analyzed under the baseline scenario where the opt-out 
provision of the 2008 LRRP rule has been eliminated as proposed.  Since the proposed LRRP Clearance 
Rule was developed before the LRRP Opt-Out Rule was finalized, section 4.7 also presents the estimated 
costs for the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule under an alternative baseline using the regulated universe 
under the 2008 LLRP Rule (which excludes opt-out eligible housing from the universe). Table 4-1 
summarizes the options presented in the economic analysis.

4.2 Number of Events with Dust Wipe Testing or Clearance Requirements  
Two requirements of the clearance rule that will have cost implications are: (1) a requirement for dust 
wipe testing for a subset of renovation activities, and (2) a requirement for dust wipe testing and clearance 
for a second subset of renovation activities where the quantity and characteristics of the dust make it hard 
to clean up.  In order to estimate the full extent of these costs, it is necessary to determine the total 
number of renovation events that will be affected by either of these additional requirements.  This section 
identifies the event types where either dust wipe testing or clearance will be required, describes the 
methodology for estimating the frequencies of these events, and then presents the resulting estimates.   
The events with additional requirements under the clearance rule are only a subset of the types of RRP 
events identified in EPA’s analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008).  This analysis relies both on 
secondary sources and primary data collected from fewer than 10 firms to estimate the frequencies of 
these dust wipe testing and clearance events. Table 4-2 and Table 4-3 describe the events requiring dust 
wipe testing or clearance in the context of the 2008 event definitions and discuss the methodology used 
for estimating event frequencies.

4.2.1 Event Frequencies Based on Primary Data Collections From Fewer Than Ten 
Firms 
This section includes the descriptions of the four questionnaires used to collect primary data from fewer 
than 10 firms.  Following the survey descriptions, the survey results are presented along with the resulting 
estimated dust wipe testing and clearance event frequencies. 
The four primary data collections include: (1) one questionnaire for nine painting contractors that is used 
to determine the frequency of interior painting jobs of various sizes that use certain paint removal 
techniques, (2) one questionnaire for six carpentry firms for determining: (a) the frequency of trim and 
molding removal, and (b) the frequency of window and door frame replacement, (3) one questionnaire for 
three general contractors that includes all the questions asked to carpenters in addition to questions that 
are used to estimate the frequency of destructive removal of plaster walls, and (4) one questionnaire for 
six general contractors used to estimate the frequency of destructive removal of plaster walls. 
4.2.1.1 Contractor Firms Sample Universe 
A geographically diverse sample of nine firms for each questionnaire was developed.  First, nine states 
were randomly selected while limiting the sample to no more than one state per EPA region.  Once the 
nine states were selected, lists of painting firms (for the paint removal survey), carpentry firms (for the 
carpenter survey), and general contractor firms (for the third and fourth survey) were obtained through 
Salesgenie.com, an online directory of businesses searchable by state and SIC code.  The simple averages 
of the responses for each questionnaire were calculated in order to estimate the necessary parameters.  For 
the interior painting questionnaire, which was administered to firms in SIC code 172101 (Painters), the 
following states were selected: Louisiana, West Virginia, Alabama, Maine, Idaho, Hawaii, Kansas, Utah, 
and Indiana. For the plaster questionnaire, which was administered to firms with SIC codes 152103, 
152105, 152115, and 152139 (General Contractors, Home Improvements, Handyman Services, and 
Remodeling & Repairing Building Contractors), the following states were selected: Texas, Iowa, 
Michigan, Maine, California, Idaho, Alabama, Colorado, and New York. The carpentry questionnaire

 Chapter 4 4-7 
used the same random set of states as the plaster survey as necessitated by the use of a combined survey 
for three of the firms. For six of the firms, entities with SIC codes of 175102, 175105, and 175110 
(Carpenters, Window Replacement, and Doors - Hanging and Cutting), were asked the same carpentry 
questions. 
4.2.1.2 Interior Painting Primary Data Collection (<10 Firms) 
Interior Painting Survey Instrument 
The script presented in Figure 4-2 was used to administer the phone interviews of representatives from 
nine interior painting firms. The introduction served to familiarize contractors with the objectives of the 
survey and the nature of EPA’s analysis.  Information collected from questions (2) through (5) was used 
to estimate the frequency of interior painting events of differing sizes using a scraper for paint removal.  
Responses to questions (6) through (8) provide data on the frequency of heat gun usage for paint removal, 
and responses to questions (9) through (11) give similar data on the frequency of high-speed machine 
usage. Questions (12) and (13) specifically ask about alternatives to high-speed machine paint removal 
and the costs of such alternatives. And finally, information collected from questions (14) through (16) 
was used to estimate the frequency of removal of trim and molding (of various sizes) during interior 
painting jobs.

Introduction: Hello, I’m _________, calling from Abt Associates. We’re an independent research firm 
that is doing contract work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We’d like to ask you a few 
questions in order to better understand how often different paint removal practices are used.  Your 
responses will be treated as confidential and your name will not be provided to the EPA.  There are 16 
questions in our survey and we expect it to take about 5 minutes. 
 
If asked why: EPA will be proposing to require dust sampling and/or clearance testing after certain paint 
removal practices are used where lead-based paint may be present.  We will use the responses to our 
survey to estimate how costly these requirements would be.

Interior Painting Survey Responses and Summary of Results 
Table 4-4 presents the individual responses from firms contacted from each state for the entire interior 
painting questionnaire.  For practices for which both an overall frequency question and relative size-
specific frequency questions were asked of firms, the percentage with which each respondent used a 
surface preparation practice for a certain size threshold was imputed, and then the average was taken 
across respondents.  In other cases, the simple averages of the frequencies are used for estimating the 
number of events affected by the proposed rule. Summary statistics are calculated in Table 4-5 to show 
the central tendency and range of work practice frequencies reported by respondents.

Frequency of Interior Painting Events Requiring Dust Wipe Testing or Clearance 
The results from the Interior Painting Firm Questionnaire can be used to estimate the frequency of events 
affected by the LRRP Clearance Rule. The frequency of interior painting with scraping are approximated 
from the responses to questions (2) through (5). Results from questions (6) through (8) are used to 
determine the frequency of interior painting events using a heat gun. Responses from questions (9) 
through (11) are used for estimation of the frequency of interior painting events involving use of a high-
speed machine for paint removal. Responses from question (14) through (16) regarding removal or 
replacement of trim or moldings are used in combination with the two other questionnaires in order to 
establish overall trim/molding event frequency, but these questions represent the frequency of painting-
specific trim or molding removal. Table 4-2 summarizes the survey-based estimation methodologies for 
interior painting event frequencies affected by the Clearance Rule. The results of two different methods 
are displayed: (1) estimating the job-size frequency as a percentage of the assumed practice frequency in 
the 2008 analysis, and (2) estimating the job-size frequency as a percentage of the average practice 
frequency reported in responses to the Interior Painting Questionnaire (See Table 4-6).

Carpentry Survey Instrument 
The following script was used for administering phone interviews of six carpentry and three general 
contractor firms. The introduction served to familiarize contractors with the objectives of the survey and 
the nature of EPA’s analysis.  Information collected from questions (1) through (4) was used to estimate 
the frequency of window replacement jobs that also involved window frame replacement. Responses to 
questions (5) through (12) provide data on the fraction of trim or molding removal activities that exceed 
various size thresholds in bathroom or kitchen remodeling jobs. The results of questions (13) and (14) 
provide insight into what other renovation events might result in removal of trim or molding.

Introduction: Hello, I’m _________, calling from Abt Associates. We’re an independent research 
firm that is doing contract work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We’d like to 
ask you a few questions in order to better understand how often different practices that sometimes 
disturb lead-based paint are used.  Your responses will be treated as confidential and your name 
will not be provided to the EPA.  There are 14 questions in our survey and we expect it to take 
about 5 minutes. 
 
If asked why: EPA will be proposing to require dust sampling and/or clearance testing after 
certain renovation practices are used that may disturb lead-based paint.  We will use the responses 
to our survey to estimate how costly these requirements would be.

Frequency of Removal or Replacement of Window or Door Frames and Trim or Molding 
Replacement 
The results from the Carpentry Questionnaire are used to estimate the frequency of events affected by the 
LRRP Clearance Rule. The results from question (2) in the survey are used to estimate the frequency of 
removing or replacing the frame during window removal/replacement events. Similarly, responses from 
question (4) are used to determine the frequency of door removal/replacement events also requiring 
removal of the door frame. The remainder of responses from the Carpentry Survey are used to estimate 
the frequency of removal of trim or molding in bathroom and kitchen remodeling jobs (for each size 
threshold). Table 4-9 summarizes the survey-based estimation methodologies for window and door event 
frequencies affected by the Clearance Rule, and Table 4-10 describes the methodology for estimating 
bathroom and kitchen events involving removal of trim or molding.

Frequency of Plaster Wall Removal Using Destructive Means 
Responses from the Plaster Survey are used to estimate the frequency of events affected by the LRRP 
Clearance Rule. Table 4-13 displays the plaster questionnaire results from above being used to calculate 
event frequencies for the removal or replacement of plaster wall using destructive means. Frequencies are 
estimated for various job sizes: greater than 6 square feet, greater than 40 square feet, and greater than 60 
square feet.

a The estimated number of events is based on the average of the responses to the survey questions, as shown in Table 4-12. 
 
Since wall removals and replacements are only a subset of all wall-disturbing (and other renovation) 
events, it is necessary to convert the frequencies above into overall proportions of 2008 LRRP Events. 
See Table 4-14 for this conversion. 
                                                     
4 This value is consistent with data from HUD’s 2001 National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing, which reports that 31% 
of painted walls in pre-1978 housing are plaster. Since not all wall repair jobs require removing all or part of the wall, the 
fraction of such jobs removing plaster walls will be less than the percentage of houses with plaster walls.

The results from the Plaster Questionnaire can be utilized to estimate the frequency of wall removal or 
repair events affected by the trim and molding specifications of the LRRP Clearance Rule.5 The 
frequency of removal of greater than 6 square feet of trim or molding in proportion to 2008 total events 
can be approximated from question (2) of the plaster survey; the frequency of removal of greater than 40 
square feet of trim or molding can be estimated from question (3); and the frequency of removal of

wall removals and replacements represent only a subset of all wall-disturbing (and other renovation)

disturbing events and additions.  This calculation is demonstrated in Table 4-16 below.

4.2.2 Event Frequencies Based on Secondary Data Sources 
4.2.2.1 Cabinet Removal 
For cabinet replacement events – which under the proposed Clearance Rule result in additional dust wipe 
testing requirements – no primary data collection was used to estimate event frequencies. According to 
the 1997 American Housing Survey, 58% of kitchen renovations and 42% of bathroom renovations 
involve cabinet replacement.  According to HUD (2001) data, 10.5% of kitchen’s have cabinets with an 
aggregate area larger than 6 square feet and less than 40 square feet, 27.5% have between 40 and 80

square feet, and 62 percent have more than 80 square feet.  It is assumed that all bathroom cabinet 
removal is between 6 and 40 square feet. In order to calculate the exact frequency for each cabinet job 
size, the following frequencies are multiplied: the percentage of renovations involving cabinet 
replacement, and the percentage of these jobs of a given square footage size threshold. These 
computations are presented in Table 4-17 below.

4.2.4 Total Number of Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Events 
This section describes the methodology for applying the event frequencies described above to the 
numbers of events estimated for the economic analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule in order to estimate the 
number of dust wipe testing and clearance events.  
4.2.4.1 Threshold Options for Amount of Painted Surfaces Disturbed 
Under the proposed rule, dust wipe testing or clearance would be required after performing certain types 
of RRP events where the total amount of painted surfaces disturbed is larger than a specified threshold 
(measured in square feet).  This analysis includes an analysis of three threshold options: 
1. Low Threshold Option 
 All event types requiring dust wipe testing where the total job size is larger than 
6 square feet.  
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
2. Proposed Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 40 square feet, 
- scraping of paint larger than 60 square feet, 
- heat gun removal of more than 6 square feet 
- Window frame or door frame removal events 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
3. High Threshold Option 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-26 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 80 square feet, 
- scraping or heat gun removal of paint larger than 120 square feet, and  
- window frame or door frame removal events. 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 60 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 60 square feet. 
 
For units undergoing regulated RRP activities, the number of events requiring either dust wipe testing or 
clearance was estimated.  Table 4-20 presents these event types, the areas in which they occur, the type of 
cleaning verification required, and the size thresholds relevant to each.

As shown in the table, window and door frame removal events do not have size thresholds associated with 
them.  It is assumed that any window or door frame removal event will require dust wipe testing, though 
the necessary amount of dust wipe testing will be dependent on the number of rooms in the work area.  
For bathroom cabinet removal events, all such events were assumed to disturb between 6 and 40 square 
feet of cabinetry. 
4.2.4.2 Estimating the Number of Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Events 
Three pieces of information were necessary to estimate the number of dust wipe testing and clearance 
events for each option: (1) the probability that an event occurs above the specified size threshold, (2) the 
mutually exclusive probability that an event only occurs in a single room within a unit and where no 
other event occurs within that unit, and (3) the joint probability that either an event occurs in multiple 
rooms within a unit or with any combination of other events within the unit.  The determination of 
mutually exclusive and joint events has two components: (1) the event type (e.g., cabinet removal), and 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-27 
(2) the room in which the event takes place (e.g., bathroom).  A mutually exclusive event is defined as a 
single event type occurring only in a single room within a unit, given that no other event types occur.  
Conversely, a joint event could be any combination of event types occurring within the same unit, or any 
combination of a single event type occurring in multiple rooms within the unit.  The probabilities that 
events occur above different size thresholds are described in sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3  
Avoiding Double Counting 
Calculating the mutually exclusive and joint probabilities for all event types was necessary to avoid 
double counting.  For example, it was estimated that cabinets and trim are replaced during 32.8% and 
66.3% of bathroom remodeling events, respectively.  Simply multiplying the number of bathroom 
remodeling events by the sum of these probabilities (99.1%) to estimate the number of dust wipe testing 
events due to cabinet or trim replacement will double count instances where cabinets and trim were 
replaced at the same time. In cases such as this, two event types occur in the same room of a single unit. 
The unit should therefore only be counted once.  Other joint events consist of one or more event types 
occurring in multiple rooms of a single unit.  For example, a bathroom cabinet removal event and a 
kitchen trim removal event may occur during a single job.  As in the previous example, simply 
multiplying the probabilities of a bathroom cabinet removal and of a kitchen trim removal by the number 
of units where bathrooms and kitchens are remodeled would count such multiple-event jobs twice. 
To avoid double counting multiple-event units, the probability of a unit having a mutually exclusive event 
is added to the probability of a unit having joint events. In the simplified case of two events types, E1 and 
E2, with probabilities that each occur, p1 and p2, respectively, the total number of affected units can be 
calculated as follows: 
  (1) Probability of each event occurring by itself: 
    Probability of E1 only: p1(only) = p1 * (1 – p2) 
    Probability of E2 only:  p2(only) = p2 * (1 – p1) 
   
 (2) Probability of both events occurring together: 
    Probability of E1 and E2:  p1,2(joint) = p1 * p2 
 
  (3) Total number of units where E1 and/or E2 occur: 
    Affected units = u * ( p1(only) + p2(only) + p1,2(joint) ) 
 
  Where: 
  u = the number of units where E1 or E2 could occur 
Although this example has two event types, the methodology can be extended to determine the number of 
affected units for any number of event types and rooms in which events occur. Note that for these 
calculations the analysis relies on the simplifying assumption that these joint probabilities are 
independently distributed.  In reality, these activities are more likely to occur together. Therefore, this 
simplifying assumption introduces an upward bias to estimates of the number of dust wipe and clearance 
events, but the magnitude of this bias is unknown.  
Grouping Events into Options by Size 
This analysis evaluates three threshold options for triggering the dust wipe testing and clearance 
requirements of the rule. The proposed clearance rule sets thresholds that are specific to the entire job (as 
opposed to being a component-specific threshold).  Thus, it is possible that two smaller renovation tasks 
occurring in the same unit could trigger the rule’s requirements, even if the tasks would not exceed the 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-28 
threshold when being performed in isolation. The tasks defined in this analysis that may contribute 
toward the same threshold requirements are as follows: 
• Removing more than 40 square feet of trim, molding, cabinets, or other fixtures 
o Replace kitchen cabinets 
o Replace bathroom cabinets 
o Replace kitchen trim 
o Replace bathroom trim 
o Replace trim during painting 
o Replace trim during addition 
o Replace trim during other wall disturbing event 
• Demolition, or removal through destructive means, of more than 6 square feet of plaster and lath 
building component 
o Destructive removal of plaster and lath building component during kitchen remodel 
o Destructive removal of plaster and lath building component during bathroom remodel 
o Destructive removal of plaster and lath building component during an addition 
o Destructive removal of plaster and lath building component during another wall-
disturbing event 
Thus, in order to calculate whether an entire job exceeded the applicable threshold it was assumed that the 
average size for a particular task is the midpoint between consecutive size thresholds.  For example, an 
average size of 23 square feet was assumed for a bathroom cabinet removal event, the midpoint between 6 
and 40 square feet.   
Based on this assumption, the amount of painted surfaces disturbed was combined for multiple-event jobs 
to determine whether the events exceed the thresholds.  For example, suppose a unit undergoes both 
bathroom cabinet and kitchen cabinet removal events that are between 6 and 40 square feet.  Because the 
estimated total job size is greater than 40 square feet (23 plus 23 equals 46), this job is assumed to exceed 
the proposed threshold option.  
Determining Maximum Room Area Size 
As in the estimation of work area sizes for the 2008 LRRP rule, the size of the work area requiring dust 
wipe testing after a multiple-event job is assumed to be equal to the maximum work area size of the 
individual events.  This assumption accounts for the overlap of different renovation activities occurring 
within the same unit (for example, replacing cabinets and re-painting a kitchen).  Bathroom and kitchen 
events are exceptions because they are separate rooms within a unit and thus cannot overlap; the sum of 
their work areas is compared to other event sizes.  For example, if the sum of a bathroom and kitchen 
event is 208 square feet and a 112 square foot painting event is also occurring in the same unit, it is 
assumed that the painting was performed in the bathroom and kitchen; therefore, the event size would be 
208 square feet. 
4.2.4.3 Total Number of Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Events 
The analysis calculated the probabilities for all possible combinations of event types and sizes.  These 
probabilities were then applied to the estimates of units performing events compliant with the 2008 LRRP 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-29 
rule and 2009 proposed opt-out rule requirements.  The resulting data included the number of units 
requiring dust wipe testing or clearance for each size threshold option.   
These data were then grouped by the maximum work area sizes to determine the appropriate allocation of 
dust wipe testing or clearance costs.6  Testing costs are dependent on work area size, as larger work areas 
require more dust wipe tests and more re-cleaning when necessary.   
Testing costs also depend on the probability that a floor is carpeted because the proposed rule only 
requires dust wipe tests for uncarpeted floors.  As the probability that a floor is carpeted differs for 
bathrooms and kitchens compared to events performed in other rooms, it was necessary to distinguish 
between bathroom, kitchen, and other events. In addition, firms performing RRP work in renter-occupied 
property will incur different paperwork costs than firms performing work in owner-occupied buildings 
under the proposed LRRP clearance rule, because the dust wipe testing report must be provided to both 
the owner and the occupant. 
Table 4-21 through Table 4-24 present the resulting number of events for dust wipe testing and clearance.  
Events are presented by building tenure, building type, work area size, and occurrence of a bathroom or 
kitchen event. Note that events in public and commercial building COFs are always assumed to exceed 
the highest size threshold option.  Table 4-25 presents the total number of dust wipe testing and clearance 
events for by the type of activity triggering the dust wipe testing or clearance requirements.

4.3 Costs of Dust Sampling and Clearance  
Two requirements of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule that have cost implications are: (1) a 
requirement to perform dust wipe testing for a subset of RRP activities, and (2) a requirement to perform 
dust wipe testing and achieve clearance for a second subset of RRP activities where the quantity of lead 
dust and the characteristics of the dust make it hard to clean up.  Figure 4-5 presents a summary of the 
dust wipe testing and clearance requirements. 
This section outlines a methodology for estimating the costs of these requirements under the proposed 
LRRP Clearance Rule and presents the resulting total costs.  First, the cost of using a third party to 
perform dust wipe testing services following certain RRP events is estimated.  Next, firm costs associated 
with dust wipe testing when the firm’s own dust sampling technician is used are described.  Re-cleaning 
cost estimates and clearance failure rates for different surfaces are also presented.  Finally, these costs are 
combined to determine the total cost of dust wipe testing and clearance requirements for all applicable 
events.

4.3.1 Costs of Renovation Firm and Third Party Dust Wipe Testing 
In order to estimate the costs of conducting dust wipe testing following RRP activities, EPA administered 
a questionnaire to nine lead evaluation firms that included questions about what the firms would charge to 
perform dust wipe testing and what the labor requirements and laboratory costs would be for performing 
the testing.  The sampling procedure for lead evaluation firm selection is discussed below.  The 
questionnaire and a description of the purpose of each question are also provided.  The final section 
outlines the results of the survey. 
4.3.1.1 Lead Evaluation Firm Sample Universe 
To draw the sample of lead evaluation firms, nine states were randomly selected while limiting the 
sample selection to no more than one state per EPA region.  In addition, states were selected such that at 
least one and no more than two states would have lead abatement and evaluation programs administered 
by EPA.7 The nine states selected according to these criteria were: Minnesota, Idaho, Georgia, Maine, 
Colorado, Oklahoma, Virginia, Kansas, and New Jersey.  Idaho was the state selected with a lead-based 
paint program administered by EPA.8 
Once the nine states were selected, lists of lead evaluation firms from state program websites were 
obtained and contractors were randomly called until a firm from each selected state agreed to complete 
the questionnaire.  One outlier response was removed from the analysis.  This was the first firm that 
completed the questionnaire, and the survey instrument completed by this firm asked about the cost for 
taking dust wipe samples, analyzing them, and providing a short report.  This firm reported extremely 
high costs and a substantial amount of the costs were related to providing the report.   Because the firm 
appears to have erroneously concluded that an exhaustive report would be required, the wording of the 
questionnaire for subsequent respondents was changed from “short report” to “one-page report.” The cost 
estimates provided by the subsequent respondents were an order of magnitude lower than those from the 
first respondent.  Since the first firm’s estimates appear to be uncharacteristically high due in part to this 
difference in wording, their responses were dropped from the analysis.  Simple averages were calculated 
for each question across the eight remaining responses in order to estimate the necessary parameters. 
4.3.1.2 Script for Lead Evaluation Firm Questionnaire 
Figure 4-1 presents the script used in the survey of lead evaluation firms.  The introduction served to 
familiarize firms with the objectives of the survey and the nature of EPA’s proposed rule revision.  
Information collected in question (1) provides a basis for estimating the costs of third party testing.  Third 
party testing may be used in some cases – even if it is not required – because it will be less expensive for 
renovation firms that perform RRP events infrequently enough that the cost of certifying a dust sampling 
technician is not justified.  Information collected in questions (2) and (3) allow estimation of the costs of 
dust wipe testing by the renovation firm.  The cost is the labor time multiplied by the renovator wage rate, 
plus lab fees, plus the cost of materials, plus the cost of shipping samples to the lab.  Information 
collected in questions (4) and (5) provide information about the amount of lead time currently needed 
before conducting a third party inspection and the amount of time it takes to get test results back after dust 
sampling, but these questions were not used in this cost analysis. 
 
                                                     
7, 8 24% of all states have a lead-based paint certification program administered by the EPA.

Introduction: Hello, I’m _________, calling from Abt Associates.  We’re an independent research 
firm that is doing contract work for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  We’d like to 
ask you a few questions in order to better understand how much it might cost to perform dust 
clearance testing after renovation activities.  EPA will be proposing to require dust sampling 
and/or clearance testing after certain renovation practices are used that may disturb lead-based 
paint.  We will use the responses to our survey to estimate how costly these requirements would 
be.  Your responses will be treated as confidential and your name will not be provided to the 
EPA.  There are 5 questions in our survey and we expect it to take less than 5 minutes.

4.3.2 Costs of Third Party Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance 
Responses to question 1 are used to estimate how much it would cost renovation firms to hire third-party 
lead evaluation firms to perform dust wipe testing in order to comply with the LRRP Clearance Rule.  
The total cost of collecting, analyzing, and reporting four dust wipe samples as well as the marginal cost 
per additional sample were estimated.  As shown in Table 4-27 below, third-party dust wipe testing costs 
are split into fixed and variable costs. 
 
Table 4-27: Fixed and Variable Costs of Dust Wipe Sampling 
Total Cost for Four Dust Wipes Additional Cost  per Wipe Fixed Costs of Dust Wipe Testing 
$262 (Question 1) $26 (Question 1a.) $262 minus four times $26 = $158 
 
Using the information on fixed and variable costs of dust wipe sampling, the costs of third-party lead dust 
wipe testing is estimated, as illustrated in Table 4-28.

failure rate; trough labor and 
material re-cleaning costs 
times the trough clearance

fixed event cost 
(A), the 
estimated

times the 
marginal cost 
(C), and re-
cleaning costs 
(D). 
aFor events in schools where there are more than four rooms affected, dust wipe samples are assumed to be taken from only four rooms.   
 
For clearance events where there are more than four rooms affected (10.3 classrooms for schools with kindergartens and 13.2 classrooms for 
schools with kindergartens and pre-kindergartens), the initial dust wipe samples are assumed to be taken from only four rooms. If all dust wipe 
samples show results below clearance levels, there is no re-cleaning. If any sample of a given type (i.e., sill, trough, or floor) fails the clearance 
test, the failed surface must be re-cleaned, and all other surfaces of the same type in the untested rooms are assumed to be re-cleaned. In the 
event of a first-round failure, exactly four dust wipe samples of the type(s) that failed are assumed to be taken.  They will include the failed 
surfaces plus additional samples as necessary to get to a total of four samples of the same type. If any sample of a given type fails the second-
round clearance test, the failed surface will be re-cleaned, and all other surfaces of the same type (i.e., sill, trough, floor) in the remaining 
untested rooms will be re-cleaned.

The costs of dust wipe sampling for a renovation firm can be split into: (1) dust sampling material costs, 
(2) renovation firm labor costs, (3) shipping of samples, (4) lab costs, (5) report paperwork costs, and (6) 
shipping of results.9  The methodology used to estimate the direct costs of dust wipe testing is presented 
in Table 4-29.  The costs associated with dust sampling technician training are presented in sections 4.4 
and 4.5. 
Dust wipe testing costs are expected to vary according to the number of samples that are required, which 
will vary depending upon the number of rooms where samples must be taken and whether or not carpet is 
                                                     
9 Most renovation firms are assumed to have a renovator become trained and certified as a Dust Sampling Technician, instead of 
hiring a third party firm to take the sample (see Section 4.4).  These firms can take the samples and send them to the lab 
themselves.  Because the staff are already at the renovation site, there are not travel costs associated with dust wipe testing 
for these events.

present.  For a typical one-room renovation event, four samples would be required (window sill, window 
trough, workroom floor, adjacent room floor).  For a renovation event where both the renovated room and 
the adjacent room are carpeted, only two samples would be required (window sill and window trough).  
Each additional room inside the work area will add 2-3 dust wipes depending on whether or not the room 
is carpeted (and whether or not there are windows in the work area), however samples are not required for 
more than 4 rooms in a unit’s work area. 
Labor time in the lead evaluation firm questionnaire was defined as “the amount of labor time, excluding 
travel time, required to take four dust wipe samples, send them to the lab, and provide a one page report 
to the contractor.” Although use of this question for estimating the labor cost for events that require more 
or less than four samples may be limited, responses to question 1a regarding the cost of taking additional  
samples can be used to estimate the additional labor necessary per sample (See column C of  Table 4-29).

4.3.4 Likelihood of Clearance Failure 
In order to approximate the frequency that dust wipe testing will result in floor or window re-cleaning 
activities, a clearance failure rate must be estimated separately for each component.  Post-cleaning 
verification lead dust levels from EPA’s Dust Study can be used to estimate what proportion of 
renovation events will fail the first (or both the first and second) round of clearance.  Table 4-30 describes 
the methodology for estimating the failure rate using two different rates of floor sample failure for work 
areas with floors in “poor” condition and work areas with floors in “fair” or “good” condition. The Dust 
Study demonstrated that poor floor condition is positively correlated with post-cleaning-verification dust 
lead levels and it is likely that more floors in the dust study were in poor condition compared to those in 
the regulated housing stock.  Therefore, this analysis estimates different clearance failure rates depending 
on floor condition in order to reduce the upward bias on failure rates that would result if the analysis did 
not account for floor condition in the failure rate estimates.  
The Dust Study included window sill dust wipe tests, but did not include window trough dust wipe tests.  
However, in many instances in the Dust Study the window sills were in such poor condition that sampling 
trays were placed on the sills and the dust wipe samples were taken from the sampling trays.  Since these 
sampling trays are likely to be easier to clean than the average window sill that may be in fair or poor 
condition, this analysis uses the floor failure rate as a proxy for the sill and trough failure rate.  The 
estimated average floor failure rate is 13.8 percent, which is higher than the 13.3 percent failure rate for 
window sill tests observed in the Dust Study.

NSLAH data.  Sample weights were used.

experiments.

n.a. 13.8% Assumed to be the same as the floor failure rate. 
 
The overall floor failure rate was estimated as a weighted average of the poor-condition floor and 
fair/good-condition floor failure rates.  HUD’s (2001) National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing 
(NSLAH) data was used to calculate the percentage of pre-1978 housing with floors that are non 
smooth/cleanable – a proxy for poor condition floors.  The overall floor clearance failure rate was 
estimated as the frequency of not smooth/cleanable floors (1.92%) multiplied by the poor-condition floor 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-43 
failure rate (78.6%), and the frequency of smooth/cleanable floors (98.08%) multiplied by the fair/good-
condition floor failure rate (12.5%).  Thus, the weighted average clearance failure rate for floor surface 
samples is 13.8%. 
This analysis makes the simplifying assumption that following a single clearance failure and the 
necessary re-cleaning activities, the sample will have an equal probability of failing clearance the second 
time around.  This assumption is made because no current studies provide information about the 
likelihood of a second clearance failure for lead dust wipe tests.  Therefore, the second failure rate can be 
estimated as the first failure rate squared – that is, the likelihood of one failure multiplied by the 
likelihood of another failure given the first failure.  The combined failure rate is the sum of this value and 
the original failure rate calculated in Table 4-30.  These combined component failure rates are presented 
below in Table 4-31.

4.3.5 Costs of Re-Cleaning After a Clearance Test Failure 
This section presents the methodology used for estimating re-cleaning costs when a clearance failure has 
occurred.  The re-cleaning methods prescribed by the LRRP Clearance Rule are the same as the initial 
cleaning methods from the 2008 LRRP Rule: thus, these costs are estimated following the 2008 analysis 
methodology.   
4.3.5.1 Costs of Re-Cleaning 
Table 4-32 lists the potential re-cleaning activities associated with clearance and describes how to 
determine costs per square foot for these activities.  It is important to note that for events that only require 
dust-wipe testing (use of a heat gun, removal or replacement of windows or door frames, scraping an area 
of 60 sq. ft. or greater, or removal of over 40 sq. ft. of trim or molding), no re-cleaning or re-testing is 
required by the rule.  For clearance events (use of a high-speed paint removal machine or demolition or 
destructive removal of over 6 sq. ft. of plaster), re-cleaning and re-sampling are necessary only for a 
subset of events in which any surface fails the first or second round of clearance.  In the event of a failed 
clearance test, only the components that failed the tests must be re-cleaned.  For example, if the window 
sill sample failed clearance but the window troughs and the floors passed, the window sill must be re-
cleaned but the window troughs and the floors do not need to be re-cleaned.

Assumptions: Labor and material costs were derived from RS Means data for the activity: “Asbestos Abatement Work 
Area, pre-cleaning, HEPA vacuum and wet wipe, flat surfaces”; cleaning of 110% of the total square footage accounts 
for additional horizontal surfaces that may require cleaning, such as floor space outside the perimeter of the work area; 
cleaning a window trough is more labor-intensive than other surfaces and thus it is assumed that this requires 6 
minutes per square foot of vacuuming and cleaning.  
 
Labor Hours Per Square Foot 
The labor hours per square foot required for HEPA vacuuming and wet wiping that was estimated for the 
2008 analysis was derived from RS Means data for the activity: “Asbestos Abatement Work Area, pre-
cleaning, HEPA vacuum and wet wipe, flat surfaces,” which specified 0.005 labor hours per square foot.  
Since following clearance failure the firm must return to the renovation work location to perform re-
cleaning and re-testing, travel costs must be included in the total cost of re-cleaning.  According to the 
2008 LRRP Rule, either a certified renovator or a worker supervised by an on-site certified renovator 
must carry out cleaning activities.10 Because estimated labor time for re-cleaning is under an hour for the 
majority of events, the analysis assumes that only the renovator will travel to re-clean the work area 
following clearance failure.  Travel cost details are provided in Table 4-33 below.

Assumptions: The worker or renovator responsible for re-cleaning the work area will travel approximately 15 miles 
(roughly 20 minutes) each direction to the job; a loaded hourly wage of $34.92 is used (from construction supervisor 
wage rates, BLS 2008); since re-cleaning jobs usually require only an hour or less of labor time, only one person 
travels to perform re-cleaning. 
a.  This mileage cost reflects the average standard mileage rate from 2008 which is used for computing deductible 
costs of operating an automobile for business purposes (IRS 2008).  This average value is computed as a simple 
average of the rate applicable from January 1 - June 30, 2008 and the rate applicable from July 1 – December 31, 
2008. 
 
The example presented in Table 4-34 – estimating costs for a small interior painting job with a high-speed 
paint removal machine in single-family owned housing– shows the cost of re-cleaning after failing a 
clearance test.  The proposed rule requirements indicate that if the residual lead level in a particular dust 
sample equals or exceeds the applicable clearance level, the components represented by the failed sample 
shall be re-cleaned or re-tested.  Since the three dust wipe samples obtained from the work area are one 
each from the floor, interior window sill, and window trough, whichever sample fails will result in the re-
cleaning of only that surface area.  Therefore, for both window failed clearance and floor failed clearance, 
three estimation steps are required: summary of required units, cost per unit, and total activity cost.

Assumptions: A small interior painting event in a single family owned property has a work area of one room and 112 
square feet; the likelihood of carpet is 52%; the labor cost uses a mean loaded wage rate of $34.92 based on average 
construction supervisor hourly wages (BLS 2008). 
 
Because prescribed re-cleaning activities are determined by which dust wipe in a given work area fails, 
the method for estimating costs is presented in three different tables (Table 4-35, Table 4-36, and Table 
4-37) for three different possible situations: a floor sample failing clearance, a window sill sample failing 
clearance, and a window trough sample failing clearance.  If more than one component were to fail 
clearance, all material and labor costs from the tables could simply be combined, except for travel (since 
the firm would not need to travel twice to re-clean two separate components). 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-46 
Table 4-38 shows several examples of the estimated cost breakdown among materials, labor, and travel, 
for each possible combination of failed work area components for a small interior painting event in 
single-family owner-occupied housing.  Overall, for a single event type such as small interior painting, 
the variance of total re-cleaning costs is small – this is because the bulk of re-cleaning costs comes from 
the travel expense portion.

In order to estimate average per-event re-cleaning costs, the likelihood of clearance failure for each 
sample type must be accounted for (see Section 4.3.4).  The analysis makes the simplifying assumption 
that sample failures are not correlated (e.g., a floor sample failure would not make a window trough 
sample failure any more likely).  In order to calculate the average re-cleaning costs for a clearance failure 
event, the likelihoods of each component failure are multiplied by their respective component cleaning 
costs, and these values are summed.  Travel, which is not a component-specific re-cleaning cost, is 
estimated as the flat travel cost above multiplied by the likelihood of any clearance failures.  The cost 
example of a small interior painting event presented in Table 4-38 above is extended below in Table 4-39 
to show the average expected re-cleaning costs.  While Table 4-38 shows the costs per re-cleaning for the 
different scenarios where it would be required, Table 4-39 presents the average expected re-cleaning 
costs, over all jobs, accounting for the instances where no re-cleaning is required because clearance is 
achieved after the initial cleaning.  Averaging the re-cleaning costs across all jobs (i.e., those that require 
re-cleaning and those that do not) simplifies the calculations by allowing the calculation of a total cost per 
event that applies to all jobs.

1 Event sizes were estimated for EPA’s 2008 LRRP Rule Analysis and represent the work area size and not necessarily the amount of lead-based paint 
disturbed.  A “bathroom size” or “kitchen size” indicates the event size, not the event type.  In addition to bathroom and kitchen events, other event 
types having these size definitions are: 
 bathroom size: wall-disturbing events, addition events 
 kitchen size: wall-disturbing events, addition events, window/door replacements 
     bathroom + kitchen size: wall-disturbing events, addition events 
2 The average number of required samples is presented.  One sample is required outside the work area and three samples are required per room in the 
work area: (1) floor sample, (2) window sill sample, and (3) window trough sample.  However, floor samples are not required on carpeted floors (so the 
minimum number of required samples may be as low as two if the work area is one room and all floors are carpeted). The estimated numbers of rooms 
affected and the probability that floors are carpeted were estimated following the methodology developed for the 2008 LRRP rule analysis. 
3 See section 4.3.3 and Table 4-29 for a description of how these costs are calculated.  
 
Events excluding kitchens or bathrooms are calculated separately from events including kitchens and bathrooms, because kitchens and bathrooms have a 
different probability of being carpeted than the rest of the house, and dust wipe samples are only taken on uncarpeted floors.

1 A “bathroom size” or “kitchen size” indicates the event size, not the event type.  In addition to bathroom and kitchen events, other event types having these size definitions are: 
 bathroom size: wall-disturbing events, addition events 
 kitchen size: wall-disturbing events, addition events, window/door replacements 
      bathroom + kitchen size: wall-disturbing events, addition events  
2 One sample is required outside the work area and three samples are required per room in the work area: (1) floor sample, (2) window sill sample, and (3) window trough sample.  However, floor 
samples are not required on carpeted floors (so the minimum number of required samples may be as low as two if the work area is one room and all floors are carpeted). The estimated numbers of rooms 
affected and the probability that floors are carpeted were estimated following the methodology developed for the 2008 LRRP rule analysis 
3 See section 4.3.3 and Table 4-29 for a description of how these costs are calculated. 
4 See section 4.3.5 for a description of how these costs are calculated. 
5 These costs vary by the size and type of the event because of varying clearance failure rates; estimated clearance failure rates are more likely for events where more samples are required.  In addition, 
shipping costs are higher for clearance events where a kitchen or bathroom is inside the work area because renovators are assumed to use overnight shipping in order to allow occupants to access the 
work area sooner. 
Note: In order to calculate a total cost per event that applies to all jobs, the average re-cleaning costs are calculated across all jobs (i.e., those that require re-cleaning and those that do not).  
Events excluding kitchens or bathrooms are calculated separately from events including kitchens and bathrooms, because kitchens and bathrooms have a different probability of being carpeted than the 
rest of the house, and dust wipe samples are only taken on uncarpeted floors.

1 A “bathroom size” or “kitchen size” indicates the event size, not the event type.  In addition to bathroom and kitchen events, other event types having these size definitions are: 
 bathroom size: wall-disturbing events, addition events 
 kitchen size: wall-disturbing events, addition events, window/door replacements 
      bathroom + kitchen size: wall-disturbing events, addition events  
2 One sample is required outside the work area and three samples are required per room in the work area: (1) floor sample, (2) window sill sample, and (3) window trough sample.  However, floor 
samples are not required on carpeted floors (so the minimum number of required samples may be as low as two if the work area is one room and all floors are carpeted). The estimated numbers of rooms 
affected and the probability that floors are carpeted were estimated following the methodology developed for the 2008 LRRP rule analysis. 
3 See section 4.3.3 and Table 4-29 for a description of how these costs are calculated. 
4 See section 4.3.5 for a description of how these costs are calculated. 
5 These costs vary by the size and type of the event because of varying clearance failure rates; estimated clearance failure rates are more likely for events where more samples are required.  In addition, 
shipping costs are higher for clearance events where a kitchen or bathroom is inside the work area because renovators are assumed to use overnight shipping in order to allow occupants to access the 
work area sooner. 
Note: In order to calculate a total cost per event that applies to all jobs, the average re-cleaning costs are calculated across all jobs (i.e., those that require re-cleaning and those that do not).  
Events excluding kitchens or bathrooms are calculated separately from events including kitchens and bathrooms, because kitchens and bathrooms have a different probability of being carpeted than the 
rest of the house, and dust wipe samples are only taken on uncarpeted floors.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-58 
4.3.7 Total Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Event Costs 
Total costs are estimated by combining the total number of events affected by the proposed Clearance 
Rule from Section 4.2 and the per-event dust wipe testing and clearance costs from the tables above.  
Table 4-50 through Table 4-52 present the final number of events, per-event costs, and total costs for dust 
wipe testing and clearance.  Costs are presented by building tenure, building type, work area size, and 
occurrence of a bathroom or kitchen event.  The different size threshold options are displayed in three 
separate tables: (1) the low threshold option, (2) the proposed option, and (3) the high threshold option.

a. These unit costs for events in public and commercial building COFs are third party costs since the analysis assumes that non-
residential contractors and operators of public and commercial building COFs will not perform enough dust wipe testing or 
clearance events annually to make training an in-house dust sampling technician worthwhile. A zero indicates that fewer than 
0.5 events are performed on average each year. 
 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-63 
4.4 Number of Sampling Technicians Seeking Training and Certification 
The proposed LRRP clearance rule would require all entities that conduct certain RRP activities known to 
generate high levels of lead dust to either hire a third party or use an employee trained as a dust sampling 
technician to perform post-renovation dust sampling.  A trained dust sampling technician is an individual 
who has successfully completed a dust sampling technician course accredited by EPA or an EPA-
authorized State or Tribal program. It is expected that two types of construction businesses will perform 
regulated RRP work – businesses with employees and non-employer, or self-employed, contractors.  In 
addition, rental companies are likely to perform some of the RRP work on the properties they manage 
rather than hire an outside contractor.  Likewise, schools and daycare centers are likely to perform some 
or all of their RRP work with their own staff.  Depending on the average number of events triggering dust 
wipe testing or clearance requirements performed by an entity each year, it will be cost-effective for some 
entities to use third-party dust sampling technicians and others to train their own dust sampling 
technician.  The sections below present an analysis of which firms and entities would choose to train their 
own dust sampling technician as well as an estimate of the number of personnel requiring additional 
training under the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule. 
4.4.1 Residential Activities: Estimating the Number of Personnel Obtaining Training to 
Meet the Demand for Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Services 
4.4.1.1 Firms Certified Under the 2008 LRRP rule and the 2009 Proposed Opt-Out Rule 
This analysis utilizes the total estimated numbers of firms seeking certification from the economic 
analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008) and the economic analysis of the 2009 proposed Opt-Out rule 
(EPA 2009). The general approach used by EPA (2008, 2009) was to obtain Census estimates of the total 
number of establishments in affected industries and adjust these estimates to account for the fact that not 
all work performed in these industries is affected by the rule.  Note that Census data are only available for 
establishments and not firms. These data are used as the basis for estimating the number of firms that will 
pursue training for a dust sampling technician.   
The total numbers of establishments are adjusted in three ways: (1) according to the share of their 
revenues that come from residential work, (2) to reflect the share of the housing stock that is affected by 
the 2009 proposed Opt-Out Rule, and (3) to reflect a 75 percent compliance rate following previous 
analyses (EPA 2008, 2009).  These adjustments imply that there will be some degree of specialization in 
regulated work.  They do not, however, imply full specialization in regulated work. For example, the 
adjustments do not fully reflect the share of RRP work that does not disturb any painted surfaces or the 
disproportionate amount of residential work that is related to new construction.  Adjusting for these two 
factors would imply more specialization and result in a lower estimate of the number of affected firms 
and personnel. 
The numbers of certified firms performing RRP in target housing under the 2008 LRRP Rule and the 
subsequent 2009 proposed Opt-Out Rule are estimated in three segments: (1) residential construction 
establishments with employees and (2) non-employer residential construction establishments (i.e., self-
employed contractors).  Note that this analysis excludes the following construction and real estate sectors 
expected to be affected by the 2008 LRRP rule but not the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule: (1) siding 
contractors, (2) other building equipment contractors, (3) other building finishing contractors, (4) glass 
and glazing contractors. 11 In addition, this analysis assumes that residential property managers and 
lessors do not perform the RRP activities that would require dust wipe testing or clearance under the 
                                                     
11  Renovators in these sectors are not expected to typically perform the types of renovation events that require dust wipe testing 
or clearance under the proposed rule.  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-64 
proposed rule.  These activities are primarily major renovations such as kitchen remodeling, bathroom 
remodeling and window and door replacement.  The more minor and routine RRP activities that would be 
expected to be performed by property manager and lessor staff, such as re-painting a rental unit, would 
generally not require using the paint removal practices that trigger the proposed clearance rule 
requirements.  To the extent that property manager and lessors have staff that perform activities that 
would be covered by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule, this analysis may be slightly understating the 
costs of performing these activities (by not including dust sampling technician training costs for these 
firms). Note that another implication of this assumption is that the estimated small business impacts 
(presented in Chapter 6) on construction firms are higher, since the costs associated with a larger number 
of events are attributed to a smaller number of firms. Table 4-54 presents the estimated number of firms 
in each segment expected to seek LRRP program certification under the 2008 LRRP rule and the 2009 
proposed Opt-Out rule.

 Chapter 4 4-65 
4.4.1.2 Estimating the Stock of Trained Dust Sampling Technicians Necessary to Meet Demand 
for Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Services in Target Housing 
The proposed LRRP Clearance rule requires firms to ensure that dust wipe testing and clearance activities 
covered by the rule are performed by certified dust sampling technicians, inspectors, or risk-assessors.  To 
estimate the number of individuals that will seek dust sampling technician training, the analysis first 
considered whether it would be more cost effective for firms to: (1) obtain dust sampling technician 
training for one of their employees, or (2) use a third party to conduct dust wipe testing. Thus, a firm must 
perform a minimum number of dust wipe testing or clearance events annually for the cost savings from 
performing this activity with their own employee to outweigh the dust sampling technician training costs.  
Following the analysis of the 2008 LRRP rule (EPA 2008), it is assumed that the number of events 
performed per firm is proportional to the number of employees per firm.  The average employment size 
was calculated by dividing the number of construction employees by the number of establishments in 
each industry (See Table 4-55).  For non-employer firms, it is assumed that one person performs all the 
RRP work.  Table 4-55 presents both the number of dust wipe testing and clearance events for the 
proposed option.

*Non-employer establishments by definition have no employees; it is estimated that these establishments are self-employed 
contractors which perform 2.8 Clearance Rule events per year, or the average number for one employee in an employer 
construction firm. 
 
Given the average annual number of dust wipe testing and clearance events performed by each category 
of firm, estimates of third party and in-house dust wipe testing costs can be compared to determine the 
most cost-effective approach to dust-wipe sampling. This comparison is presented in Table 4-56.  Since 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-66 
the firm category with the maximum number of annual dust wipe testing and clearance events only has an 
average of 37.8 of these events annually (“Drywall and insulation contractors”), and each dust wipe 
testing event requiring four samples only takes on average 1.75 hours, it is reasonable to assume that no 
firm would need to train more than one dust sampling technician for an annual maximum total of 66 hours 
of work per year. 12 
Given that the expected amount firms save by using their own dust sampling technicians is much greater 
than the  annualized cost of dust sampling technician training ($146)13 for certified firms in all of the 
sectors shown in Table 4-56, this analysis assumes that each establishment will choose to incur training 
costs for one dust sampling technician.  Note that this result also holds true for the alternative options 
considered in this analysis (not shown in table).

12 The average amount of labor time necessary for a dust sampling event with four required samples was estimated using primary 
data collection of 9 lead evaluation firms. The specific results of this survey are available in Section 4.3.1. 
13 This average cost is calculated by dividing the 50-year average dust sampling technician training costs ($29,563,881) by the 
50-year average number of firms expected to seek dust sampling technician training (202,745). 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-67 
4.4.2 Public and Commercial Building Activities: Estimating the Number of Personnel 
Obtaining Training to Meet the Demand for Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance 
Services 
This analysis compared the costs of using third party dust sampling technicians with the costs of training 
a dust sampling technician for those public and commercial building owners that perform RRP using their 
own staff.  However, since this analysis estimates that staff in public and commercial building COFs will 
perform activities requiring dust wipe testing or clearance relatively infrequently, the per-event cost 
savings from having a trained dust sampling technician on staff are not large enough to justify the dust 
sampling technician training costs.  The additional costs associated with using third party testing for a 
dust wipe testing or clearance event in a public or commercial building is estimated to range from $149 to 
$161, which is well below the estimated costs of obtaining dust sampling technician training, $621. Thus, 
the analysis assumes that public and commercial building COFs will use third party testing in lieu of 
training their own dust sampling technician. 
The economic analysis for the 2008 LRRP rule estimated that there would be 3,223 nonresidential 
contractors seeking certification in the first year of the rule’s implementation, and that these contractors 
would perform an average of 280,434 events per year (EPA 2008).  However, since this analysis 
estimates that non-residential contractors will perform only an average of 406 dust wipe testing or 
clearance events annually, or one regulated event about every eight years on average, the additional costs 
associated with third party testing, $155, are lower than the dust sampling training cost of $621.14, Thus, 
it is assumed that these nonresidential building contractors will use third party testing rather than obtain 
dust sampling technician training for one of their employees.  Note that although the analysis makes the 
simplifying assumption that third party testing will always be used for dust wipe testing and clearance 
events in public and commercial buildings, in reality some firms with trained dust sampling technicians 
may perform some of this work.  These firms could be non-residential contractors specializing in dust 
wipe testing and clearance work, or they could be firms that also perform dust wipe testing and clearance 
in residential units.  To the extent that third party testing is not used, this analysis may be overstating the 
costs of dust wipe testing and clearance for these structures. 
4.4.3 Estimating the Number of Personnel Seeking Training Each Year Under the LRRP 
Clearance Proposed Rule 
The number of individuals seeking training in any given year is estimated from the stock of firms and 
individuals necessary to meet demand for dust wipe testing services.  (Because training is valid for five 
years, the annual number trained each year after the first year is a fraction of the total stock of trained 
individuals and certified firms).  
Note that many of the additional dust sampling technicians that are expected undergo training because of 
the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule are likely to seek training before the provision goes into effect.  
However, this analysis utilizes the simplifying assumption that any additional initial training takes place 
over a 12 month period starting from the date of the expansion of the regulated universe.   
4.4.3.1 Training after the Initial Years 
Following the 2008 LRRP rule analysis (EPA 2008), this analysis assumes a steady annual number of 
individual trainings following the first year of regulation with an annual decline of 0.41 percent.   Note 
                                                     
14 This analysis assumes that private schools, public schools, and non-profit daycare centers which use in-house staff to perform 
RRP will perform all window/door carpentry work in-house.  Non-residential contractor firms will perform all other RRP.  
Non-residential contractor firms will perform all RRP events in owner-occupied daycare centers, daycare centers that do not 
perform all of their own RRP (i.e., contract some of it out), and small private schools. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-68 
that if all the individuals needed to meet the demand for clearance requirements were trained in the first 
year, one might expect a drop in the level of training in the second year, followed by a spike in the fifth 
year.  That is, one might expect a cyclical pattern of training to emerge.  However, it is difficult to predict 
how cyclical the training demand might be or how this cyclicality might diminish over time.  Therefore, 
this analysis assumes that a typical amount of training occurs each year after the first year.  Modeling a 
cyclical component would add little to the analysis without being able to estimate the extent of any 
cyclicality more precisely. 
The analysis does account for trained individuals that exit the industry each year and are replaced by new 
entrants.  This analysis accounts for turnover in the regulated RRP industry by assuming a certain 
percentage of trainings each year are initial trainings.  Specifically, after the first year, 86.7% percent of 
the dust sampling technicians seeking training are assumed to be seeking their initial certification. This 
percentage is based on the relative number of Abatement Supervisors applying for initial certifications 
according to the Federal Lead-Based Paint Program (FLPP) database (EPA 2005).15 
4.4.3.2 Summary of Number of Individuals Trained to Perform Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance 
Table 4-57 presents a summary of the estimated stock of dust sampling technicians that will perform RRP 
requiring dust wipe testing or clearance. The number of trained personnel are segmented by establishment 
type: employer construction, non-employer construction, and residential property manager and lessor.  As 
demonstrated in Section 4.4.2, no employees working in public and commercial buildings are expected to 
seek dust sampling technician training.  In year one, a total of 223,821 trained dust sampling technicians 
will be necessary to perform dust wipe testing and clearance services for regulated residential RRP. As 
described above, this number decreases by 0.41% each year to account for the decline in pre-1978 
building stock.

4.5 Sampling Technician Training Costs 
Training costs include the cost of the time spent on training activities as well as the associated travel and 
tuition costs.  Note that tuition costs are assumed to include the costs associated with training provider 
accreditation.  In other words, it is assumed that accredited training providers pass along their 
                                                     
15 It was found in this study of a training certification program that lasted three years that in a given year, 52% of individuals 
seeking training were seeking initial training, and 48% were seeking refresher training. This percentage was adjusted to 
apply to a 5-year training cycle (86.7%) by multiplying 52% by five-thirds. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-69 
accreditation fees and other administrative costs through their tuition.  These accreditation fees and other 
administrative costs are estimated in the paperwork burden analysis but are only implicitly accounted for 
(as part of tuition costs) in the estimates of the total cost of the rule.   
4.5.1 Training Burden Per Individual 
To estimate the incremental burden of training dust sampling technicians, several cost components are 
calculated including tuition rates, wage rates, and travel and expense costs.  Each certified dust sampling 
technician will participate in 8 hours of formal initial training.  Refresher dust sampling technician 
certification training is required every five years; the refresher course is four hours.   
Tuition for the initial certified dust sampling technician training class is estimated to be $205 and each 
corresponding refresher course’s tuition is estimated to be $103.  This estimate relies on the assumption 
that the average hourly tuition is equal to the observed rates for the accredited lead abatement and 
evaluation courses ($23.26/hr). This value is then converted to 2008 dollars.16  Additional travel and meal 
costs associated with training are assumed to be $134 (EPA 2006).17  Digital photos of each certified dust 
sampling technician are also added into the additional costs.  The total cost for a one-time use digital 
camera that takes 25 pictures is $14 ($0.56 per picture taken).  The total time allotted to taking and 
processing these photos is estimated at 3 minutes ($1.20), which results in a total cost of $1.76 (or $2 in 
2008 dollars). For a class size of 10 students, 3 minutes per student is equivalent to a total time of 30 
minutes to take the digital photos, associate them with the appropriate students, and insert the photos onto 
the training certificates.   
The value of the time for certified dust sampling technicians to receive formal initial training is $279 (8 
hours at a loaded wage rate of $34.92/hour); for refresher training the value is $140 (EPA 2006).  
Certified dust sampling technicians might be self-employed or employed by a larger company.  Therefore, 
the value of time is likely to represent a mix of lost wages and additional overhead to firms. As shown in 
Table 4-58, the aggregated incremental cost of training is $621 for initial certified dust sampling 
technician training and $378 for refresher certified dust sampling technician training.

4.5.2 Total Training Costs 
Table 4-59 presents the total training costs of the rule for the first three years.  The number of dust 
sampling technicians seeking training is described in Section 4.4.3; the value of training time for dust 
sampling technicians is described in Section 4.5.1.  The average training cost per renovator varies in the 
initial years of the regulation according to the relative number of initial and refresher trainings.  After the 
                                                     
16 The average of the hourly tuition rates are used rather than picking a single similar course because no single 
course is similar enough to the dust sampling technician course.  For example, the initial courses are the only 
courses with hands-on training, but they are also longer than the technician course.  The refresher courses are 
more similar in length, but have no hands on requirements.   
17 Travel costs include 2 hours of travel time ($70), meals ($10), and mileage costs (50 miles, $54).

first year, 86.7 percent of contractors and public or commercial building renovators receive initial training 
(due to turnover in the industry) and the rest obtain refresher training.  Note that an individual who 
received initial training and let their certification expire must retake the initial training. The stock of 
regulated structures declines by 0.41 percent annually which also reduces the demand for lead-safe 
renovation services, the number of dust sampling technicians seeking training, and the undiscounted total 
training costs.  As shown in Table 4-59, total training costs for Year 1 will be $138,993,017 and total 
training costs for Year 2 will be $25,475,936.

4.6 Total Incremental Costs of Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
This section presents the total costs of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  Total costs are presented for 
the first and second years of regulation, and total 50-year and annualized costs are also calculated.  The 
total costs are calculated over a 50-year period using both 3 and 7 percent discount rates.  Discounting 
refers to the economic conversion of future costs (and benefits) to their present values, accounting for the 
fact that society tends to value future costs or benefits less than comparable near-term costs or benefits.  
Discounting is important when the values of costs or benefits occur over a multiple year period and may 
vary from year to year.  Discounting enables the accumulation of the cost and benefit values from 
multiple years at a single point in time, accounting for the difference in how society values those costs 
and benefits depending on the year in which the values are estimated to occur. 
The 50-year costs were estimated by developing a profile of the compliance costs associated with each 
option over a 50-year period.  (The 50-year period was chosen to be consistent with the economic analysis 
done for the TSCA Section 403 Lead-Based Paint Hazard Standards.)  The profile of costs over time was 
developed by estimating an annual decline in pre-1978 housing stock of 0.41 percent per-year and 
assuming that the regulated universe would decrease by that rate every year.  That rate was calculated 
using the average annual compound rate of change in the pre-1980 housing stock using data from the 
1990 and 2000 Decennial Census (U.S. Census Bureau 1990 and 2000c).  This rate affects costs because 
it decreases the number of events and number of workers trained every year. 
As discussed above, first year dust sampling technician training costs account for the training and 
certification of all dust sampling technicians required to meet the demand for dust wipe testing and 
clearance services in the first year.  In subsequent years, it is assumed that one fifth of the necessary stock 
of individuals will obtain training each year (since refresher-training and re-certification is required every 
five years). 
The total 50-year costs and the 50-year annualized costs are discounted using rates of 3 and 7 percent.  
These discount rate values reflect guidance from the Office of Management and Budget regulatory 
analysis guidance document, Circular A-4 (OMB, 2003). 
The following formula was used to calculate the present value (PV) of the time stream of costs:

where: 
  Costt = Costs in year t; 
  r  = Discount rate (3 percent and 7 percent); and 
  t  = Year in which cost is incurred. 
 
This analysis also presents the 50-year annualized costs of the rule.  Conceptually, the 50-year annualized 
cost is the level annual payment that one would have to make to pay off a debt equal to the present value 
total 50-year cost for a given interest rate (the discount rate).

Table 4-60 presents the first year, second year, total 50-year and 50-year annualized incremental costs of 
the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule. Total work practice costs are lower for the options with larger size 
thresholds for triggering the rule’s requirements.  As shown in the table, training costs are not assumed to 
vary with the size thresholds.  However, it should be noted that it is possible that fewer sampling 
technicians may seek training if the universe of events changes, in which case the difference in costs 
between threshold options would be larger than estimated for this analysis.

of the activities that are expected to occur in these structures are assumed to exceed all size thresholds. 
 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-73 
Table 4-61 presents more detail on which types of events drive the total incremental work practice costs 
of the rule.  The table demonstrates that despite the relatively higher costs of clearance, dust wipe testing 
accounts for the substantial majority of the total work practice costs because of the higher frequency with 
which it is required.  
The largest contributor to total work practice costs under the low and the proposed threshold options is 
from dust wipe testing multiple activity events, which represent the dust wipe testing events that trigger 
more than one of the rule’s threshold requirements.  These event types represent a smaller share of the 
total costs for the larger size threshold options, since fewer renovation activities trigger the rule’s 
requirements as the size threshold increases.  For example, dust wipe testing for an event where a door 
and 10 square feet of trim was removed would be considered a multiple activity event under the low 
threshold option (since the trim removal and door removal both trigger the dust wipe testing 
requirements).  However, this would be categorized as a door removal event under the proposed option 
(since the door removal is the only activity that triggers the rule’s requirements under the proposed 
option).  This example also illustrates why total window/door frame removal event costs are higher for 
the higher threshold options even though the size thresholds for these activities do not vary by option.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-74 
 
4.7 Alternative Baseline and Options 
4.7.1 2008 LRRP Rule Universe (Excludes Opt-Out Eligible Housing) 
This section presents the costs for the alternative baseline scenario where the opt-out provision is not 
eliminated as proposed in October 2009 (74 FR 55506).  The primary cost estimates for the Proposed 
LRRP Clearance Rule were estimated under a baseline scenario where the opt-out provision of the 2008 
LRRP rule has been eliminated.  However, because the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule was developed 
before the LRRP Opt-Out Rule was finalized, the costs of the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule are also 
estimated for the alternative baseline scenario where the opt-out provision has not been eliminated.  
Under this alternative baseline it is estimated that there would be fewer affected events and fewer 
sampling technicians seeking training because opt-out eligible housing units would be able to opt-out of 
the requirements of the LRRP program, including the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule. Opt-out eligible 
housing includes owner-occupied housing units that are not COFs where no child under the age of six or 
pregnant woman resides.  
Table 4-62 presents the total estimated number of events and target housing work practice costs under this 
alternative baseline scenario.  The estimated number of events is 1,032,606 under this scenario compared 
to 1,595,856 under the primary baseline scenario and the total target housing work practice costs are $165 
million under this scenario compared to $254 million under the primary baseline scenario (See Table 4-62 
and Table 4-51).  The public and commercial building COF universe and costs are the same under both 
scenarios.

Table 4-63 presents the estimated number of sampling technicians trained under the alternative baseline 
scenario where the opt-out provision is not eliminated.  The estimated number of sampling technicians 
trained in the first year is 136,714 under this scenario compared to 233,821 under the primary baseline 
scenario and the total first year training costs are $85 million under this scenario compared to $139 
million under the primary baseline scenario (See Table 4-63 and Table 4-59).

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 Chapter 4 4-79 
Because this option assumes that all dust wipe testing and clearance events will be performed by third 
party firms, the costs associated with dust sampling technicians are implicitly included in the additional 
costs associated with third party testing.   
Table 4-66 presents a comparison of the costs of the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule for both the primary 
option and the alternative option where all dust sampling following target housing events is performed by 
third party establishments instead of residential RRP firms.  Under this alternative option it is estimated 
that there would be the same number of affected events and higher overall costs.

4.7.3 Dust Wipe Testing Only Option 
This section presents the estimated costs under an alternative option where only dust wipe testing is 
required in all instances where either dust wipe testing or clearance is required under the proposed rule 
(i.e., clearance is not required for any RRP events). 
Table 4-67 presents the total estimated number of events and target housing work practice costs under this 
alternative option.  The estimated number of events is the same under the dust wipe testing option 
compared to the primary option, although all events previously requiring clearance will now only require 
dust wipe testing.  The total target housing work practice costs are $249 million under this scenario 
compared to $254 million under the primary option (See Table 4-67 and Table 4-51).  The public and

a. These unit costs for events in public and commercial building COFs are third party costs 
since the analysis assumes that non-residential contractors and operators of public and 
commercial building COFs will not perform enough dust wipe testing events annually to make 
training an in-house dust sampling technician worthwhile. 
 
Because under this option all residential construction establishments will still be expected to train an in-
house dust sampling technician, total training costs will be the same under both the primary option and 
alternative option.  Therefore – as under the primary option – the estimated number of sampling 
technicians trained in the first year will be 233,821 and training costs will amount to $139 million. 
Table 4-69 presents a comparison of the costs of the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule for both the primary 
option and the alternative option under which all events affected by the rule would only require dust wipe 
testing.  Under this alternative option it is estimated that there would be the same total number of affected 
events, the same total number of sampling technicians and training costs, and lower average per-event 
costs.

This section presents the estimated costs under an alternative option where clearance is required in all 
instances where either dust wipe testing or clearance is required under the proposed rule. 
Table 4-70 presents the total estimated number of events and target housing work practice costs under this 
alternative option.  The estimated number of events is the same under this scenario compared to the 
primary option, although all events previously only requiring dust wipe testing will now require achieving 
clearance.  The total target housing event costs are $351 million under this scenario compared to $254 
million under the primary option (See Table 4-70 and Table 4-51).  Public and commercial building COF 
universe and costs under the alternative option are presented in Table 4-71.

5. Benefits of the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
A great deal of information on the numerous adverse health effects of lead is available from decades of 
medical observation and scientific research.  Inhaled or ingested lead is distributed throughout the body 
and is toxic to many organ systems.  As a result, its toxicity manifests itself in the form of impacts on 
several organ systems.  A reduction in lead exposure resulting from the proposed rule would lead to a 
reduction in these adverse health effects and the costs of treating them.  Young children (from birth 
through age five) are particularly sensitive to lead, which impairs a child’s neuropsychological 
development (frequently measured by IQ change).  This chapter presents a discussion of the benefits 
associated with reducing lead exposure through revising the lead, renovation, repair, and painting (LRRP) 
program regulations, by estimating the numbers of the populations expected to be affected.   
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would require dust wipe testing after many of the RRP activities 
regulated under the 2008 LRRP rule, and would require clearance after a smaller subset of RRP activities. 
The clearance requirements of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule are expected to result in lower 
exposures to dust lead by reducing the amount of dust lead left behind after renovation, repair, and 
painting (RRP). Two types of benefits are expected to be realized from the proposed dust wipe testing 
requirements.  The first type is the direct benefits of the information to the owners and occupants, which 
includes the value of the information on dust lead levels remaining in the renovation work area. For 
building owners and occupants, this information is likely to improve their understanding and awareness of 
dust lead hazards.  It will also greatly improve their ability to make further risk management decisions.  
This information is particularly critical where dust lead levels approach or exceed the regulatory hazard 
standards.  The second benefit expected to be realized from the proposed dust wipe testing requirements 
stems from changed behavior on the part of renovation firms.  EPA believes that dust wipe testing results 
will also provide valuable feedback to renovation firms on how well they are cleaning up after 
renovations.  It is likely that the specific dust lead levels contained in dust wipe testing results will 
increase renovation firm cleaning efficiency.  Renovation firms will be incentivized to lower the dust lead 
levels remaining after renovation jobs, even if the levels are at or near the regulatory standards.  Because 
proper cleanup plays such a vital role in the minimization of dust lead hazards created by renovations, 
providing information on dust lead levels remaining after renovations to building owners and occupants 
will serve as an incentive for firms to perform post-renovation cleaning efficiently and thoroughly, 
reducing the amount of dust lead left behind after RRP. 
An overview of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule, as it applies to this benefits estimation, is provided 
in Section 5.1.  Section 5.2 presents the estimated number of children, pregnant woman, and adults who 
reside in or occupy (i.e., attend school or receive childcare in) the structures affected by the proposed rule. 
Finally, in Section 5.3, the human health and ecological consequences of lead exposure are summarized.   
This analysis does not quantify the value of the benefits of the proposed rule, but presents estimated 
numbers of some of the populations expected to be affected.  
5.1 Overview of Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule in Terms of Benefits 
Estimation 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes several revisions to the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair, and 
Painting Program (RRP) rule that established accreditation, training, certification, and recordkeeping 
requirements as well as work practice standards for persons performing renovations for compensation in 
most pre-1978 housing and child-occupied facilities.  EPA is particularly concerned about dust lead 
hazards generated by renovations because of the well-documented toxicity of lead, especially to younger 
children.  The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes additional requirements designed to ensure that 
lead-based paint hazards generated by renovation work are adequately cleaned after renovation work is

finished and before the areas are re-occupied.  Specifically, EPA is proposing to require dust wipe testing 
after many renovations covered by the RRP rule.  For a subset of jobs involving demolition or removal of 
plaster through destructive means or the disturbance of paint using machines designed to remove paint 
through high-speed operation, such as power sanders or abrasive blasters, this proposal would also require 
the renovation firm to demonstrate, through dust wipe testing, that dust-lead levels remaining in the work 
area are below regulatory levels.   
With regard to potential implications of lead effects on IQ, the Air Quality Criteria Document recognizes 
the ‘‘critical’’ distinction between population and individual risk, identifying issues regarding declines in 
IQ for an individual and for the population. The Criteria Document further states that a ‘‘point estimate 
indicating a modest mean change on a health index at the individual level can have substantial 
implications at the population level’’ (CD, p. 8–77).  A downward shift in the mean IQ value is associated 
with both substantial decreases in percentages achieving very high scores and substantial increases in the 
percentage of individuals achieving very low scores (AQCD, p. 8–81).  For an individual functioning in 
the low IQ range due to the influence of developmental risk factors other than lead, a lead-associated IQ 
decline of several points might be sufficient to drop that individual into the range associated with 
increased risk of educational, vocational, and social failure (AQCD, p. 8–77).   
Other cognitive effects observed in studies of children have included effects on attention, executive 
functions, language, memory, learning and visuospatial processing (AQCD, sections 5.3.5, 6.2.5 and 
8.4.2.1), with attention and executive function effects associated with lead exposures indexed by blood 
lead levels below 10 μg/dL (AQCD, section 6.2.5 and pp. 8–30 to 8–31). The evidence for the role of lead 
in this suite of effects includes experimental animal findings (discussed in AQCD, section 8.4.2.1; p. 8–
31), which provide strong biological plausibility of lead effects on learning ability, memory and attention 
(AQCD, section 5.3.5), as well as associated mechanistic findings.  
These cognitive and behavioral effects, discussed above, are strongly related to future productivity and 
expected earnings (Salkever 1995).   Based on Salkever’s coefficients, the estimated value of an IQ point 
is $14,280 (2008 dollars).  This IQ value is modeled as the present value of a loss in expected lifetime 
earnings due to a one point IQ drop.  The present value is calculated assuming that children would be 
affected by lead at 3 years of age, the median of the range when children are most susceptible to lead 
hazards; that while most people start working at age 18, average income in the early adult years is 
reduced because some are still in school; and that retirement occurs at the age of 67.  This estimated value 
of an IQ point is limited to reduced income, and does not include other potential impacts such as 
additional education costs for special and remedial education, and medical costs to treat very high levels 
of lead.   
Both epidemiologic and toxicological studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead 
affect many different organ systems (EPA 2006b, p.E-8).  It appears that some of these effects, 
particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's neurobehavioral 
development, may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a threshold (EPA 2004).   
Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between lead exposure and enhanced 
risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and increased 
hypertension (EPA 2006b).  A meta-analysis of numerous studies estimates that a doubling of blood-lead 
level (e.g., from 5 to 10 μg/dL) is associated with ~1.0 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) increase in 
systolic blood pressure and ~0.6 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure.  The evidence for an association of 
lead with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is limited but supportive (EPA 2006b, p. E-10). 
The Criteria Document states ‘‘although an increase of a few mmHg in blood pressure might not be of

substantial increases in the percentages of individuals with values that are sufficiently extreme that they 
exceed the criteria used to diagnose hypertension’’ (EPA 2006b, p. 8–77). 
Neurotoxic effects in children and cardiovascular effects in adults are among those best substantiated as 
occurring at blood-lead concentrations as low as 5 to 10 ug/dL (or possibly lower); and these categories of 
effects are currently clearly of greatest public health concern (EPA 2006b, p 8-60). Other newly 
demonstrated immune and renal system effects among general population groups are also emerging as 
low-level lead exposure effects of potential public health concern (EPA 2006b, p 8-60).   
Some studies have examined the question of whether the neurological effects of exposures in early 
childhood are ameliorated when blood-lead levels decline.  The data are mixed on this issue.  In a study 
that treated lead-exposed children with a chelating agent, Ruff (1993) found that children whose blood-
lead levels had the greatest decline showed the most improvement in cognitive scores.  In contrast, Rogan 
(2001) found that treatment with a chelating agent lowered blood-lead levels in children but did not 
appear to improve neurological function.  Liu (2002) also found that chelation therapy at age 2, while 
lowering blood-lead levels, did not improve neurological function in children at 5 years of age.  While the 
study did detect a relationship between declining blood-lead and improved neurological function, this 
association was observed only in the untreated group, leading the authors to speculate that some other 
factor besides declining lead levels from chelation therapy (such as greater parental involvement), led to 
the neurological gains.  Dietrich (2004) had similar findings in the same cohort of children at 7 years of 
age.  One study cited in ATSDR (1999) showed impaired motor and cognitive function at a current mean 
level of 2.9 μg/dL, about 20 years after exposure when blood-lead levels were 40-50 μg/dL (Stokes 1998).  
The negative impact of lead on IQ and other neurobehavioral outcomes persist in most recent studies 
following adjustment for numerous confounding factors including social class, quality of caregiving, and 
parental intelligence. Moreover, these effects appear to persist into adolescence and young adulthood in 
the absence of marked reductions in environmental exposure to lead (EPA 2006b, p. 6-76). This further 
supports the concern that early exposures to lead may lead to irreversible damage and supports the 
benefits of regulatory interventions to prevent and/or reduce lead exposure.  
Renovation activities that disturb lead-based paint create high dust-lead levels which are not removed 
through typical cleaning practices.  EPA’s Dust Study (EPA 2007) found that dust-lead levels created by 
renovation activities ranged from 422 to 32,633 μg/ft2.  While dry sweeping and the use of a regular shop 
vacuum resulted in a reduction in these levels, a significant amount of leaded dust remained.  All 
residents of the household or occupants of the building can be exposed to this dust, regardless of age.  
EPA’s Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA 1997) contains recommended soil and dust ingestion estimates 
for adults, and EPA’s Child-Specific Exposure Factors Handbook (EPA 2008a), which includes 
recommended soil and dust ingestion estimates for children between the ages of 6 and 21.  
5.1.1 Regulatory Options for Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
The economic analysis presented in this report considers various regulatory options.  The three primary 
options considered in this analysis only differ in the size thresholds that trigger the rule’s requirements 
when performing certain renovation activities.   The three threshold options considered in this analysis 
are: 
1. Low Threshold Option 
 All event types requiring dust wipe testing where the total amount of lead-based 
paint disturbed is larger than 6 square feet.  
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet.

 Chapter 5 5-4 
2. Proposed Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 40 square feet, 
- scraping of paint larger than 60 square feet, 
- heat gun removal of more than 6 square feet 
- Window frame or door frame removal events 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 6 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 6 square feet. 
3. High Threshold Option 
 Dust wipe testing is required for: 
- cabinet and trim events larger than 80 square feet, 
- scraping or heat gun removal of paint larger than 120 square feet, and  
- window frame or door frame removal events. 
 Clearance is required for: 
- high-speed machine removal of paint larger than 60 square feet, and 
- plaster removal using destructive means, larger than 60 square feet. 
This analysis considers three alternative options in addition to the three primary options: (1) an option 
where third party dust wipe testing and clearance is required, (2) an option where dust wipe testing is 
required in lieu of the clearance required under the proposed option, and (3) an option where clearance is 
required in lieu of the dust wipe testing required under the proposed option. The number of individuals 
affected under these alternative options are the same as those affected under the proposed option.  
Therefore, separate estimates of affected populations are not presented for these alternative options. 
All the primary and alternative options are analyzed under the baseline scenario where the opt-out 
provision of the 2008 LRRP rule has been eliminated as proposed (the opt out provision allows owner-
occupied housing units where no child under the age of six or pregnant woman resides to opt out of the 
rule’s requirements).  Since the LRRP Opt-Out Rule is not a final rule, the analysis also presents 
estimates of the populations affected by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule under the alternative baseline 
assuming the regulated universe under the 2008 LRRP Rule (which excludes opt-out eligible housing 
from the universe). Table 5-1 summarizes the options presented in the economic analysis.

5.2 Residents and Occupants of Structures Regulated by the Proposed LRRP 
Clearance Rule 
The residents and occupants of the structures regulated under the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule include: 
(1) children residing in target housing, (2) children receiving childcare in target housing, (3) children 
attending daycare in a public or commercial building, (4) children attending school in a public or 
commercial building, (5) adults residing in target housing, (6) adults working in a public or commercial 
building COF. This section presents the estimated number of individuals who reside in or occupy these 
regulated structures and presents the estimated number of these individuals residing in or occupying a 
structure where dust wipe testing or clearance is expected to be performed. 
Section 5.2.1 describes the methods and sources for these estimates and section 5.2.2 presents the 
resulting estimated populations. 
5.2.1 Methodology and Sources for Estimating Affected Populations 
This analysis presents the estimated number of target housing residents, children receiving childcare in 
target housing, and children attending daycare or schools in public and commercial buildings.  The 
number of adults who work in a public or commercial building COF was not estimated for this analysis, 
but these individuals would also be expected to benefit from the proposed rule. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-6 
5.2.1.1 Estimating the Number of Target Housing Residents 
The 2003 American Housing Survey (AHS) (U.S. Census, 2003) was used to estimate the number of 
individuals residing in target housing where dust wipe testing and clearance events occur. The AHS 
includes household level microdata with information on the number and ages of housing occupants, 
household-level renovation data, and other housing characteristics.  Chapter 4 of this report provides a 
description of how EPA estimated the frequencies of dust wipe testing and clearance activities using AHS 
data and questionnaires administered to fewer than 10 respondents. This methodology was used to 
determine which respondent households in the AHS data were performing regulated renovation activities, 
and therefore the number and demographics of the occupants residing in these households can easily be 
determined since this is reported at the household level. For example, some households reported 
remodeling their kitchen in the American Housing Survey, and a subset of these households are estimated 
to trigger the dust wipe testing requirements associated with trim and cabinet replacement (as described in 
Chapter 4).  Since the American Housing Survey includes information on the number and ages of housing 
occupants, the number and ages of individuals affected by the rule in these households can be estimated. 
5.2.1.2 Estimating the Number of Children Receiving Childcare in Target Housing 
EPA estimated the number of children receiving childcare in target housing affected by the dust wipe 
testing and clearance requirements in three steps: (1) the number of target housing unit COFs and the 
frequency of regulated activities was estimated; (2) the number of children receiving childcare in target 
housing was estimated; and (3) the estimated frequencies of the activities in target housing were applied 
to number of children receiving childcare in these target housing units to estimate the number of children 
affected by the proposed rule. 
Step One: Estimate Number of Target Housing COFs and the Frequency of Regulated Activities 
The estimate of the number of target housing units that are COFs was developed for the economic 
analysis of the 2008 LRRP Rule.  EPA (2008b) provides a detailed explanation of these estimates which 
is summarized here. The COFs in target housing include family daycare providers and the homes of 
family, friends, and neighbors who regularly care for someone else’s children.  The estimates include care 
provided for pay and not for pay, and rely primarily on estimates of the size of the childcare workforce as 
published by the Center for Childcare Workforce, 2002.  This report includes data on the number of: (1) 
family childcare providers caring for unrelated children, (2) paid relatives and non-relatives providing 
childcare, and (3) unpaid relatives and non-relatives providing childcare.   
Based on data provided by the Center for Childcare Workforce, a total of just under 2.4 million caregivers 
provide care outside of the child’s home for more than six hours per week.  As described in detail by EPA 
(2008b), these data are used to estimate the number of COFs in target housing.  These numbers are further 
reduced to estimate the number of pre-1978 housing units based on American Housing Survey data.  The 
frequency of dust wipe testing and clearance is assumed to be the same in target housing COFs as 
estimated for other target housing. 
Step Two: Estimate Number of Children Receiving Childcare in Target Housing 
Data from Table 2 of Mulligan et al (2001) were used to determine the number of children under six years 
of age in Target Housing COFs.   Population data from Mulligan et al (2001) for target housing includes 
children in the care of relatives and non-relatives as well as the proportion (5 percent) of children in 
centers identified as being in private settings (i.e., family care).1  Other adjustments were made to exclude 
                                                     
1  This analysis assumes that all daycare centers are located in public or commercial buildings (i.e., not in 
residential buildings).  Due to differences in licensing requirements and survey questionnaire design, some 
sources used in this analysis categorize children cared for in residential settings as being in center-based care.  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-7 
paid care by a non-relative (e.g., a nanny) in the child’s home.  Relative and non-relative care were further 
classified into paid and non-paid care.  Based on information presented in Mulligan et al (2001), the 
following adjustments were made for each category: 
1. Paid non-relative care not in the child’s home (i.e., family care):  
a. 81 percent of non-relative care occurs in location outside of the child’s home.   
b. 5 percent of center-based care occurs in a private setting – assumed to be non-relative 
care outside child’s home. 
c. 90 percent of non-relative care is paid.  
 
2. Unpaid non-relative care (not in the child’s home): 
a. 81 percent of non-relative care occurs in location outside of the child’s home.   
b. 5 percent of center based care occurs in a private setting – assumed to be non-relative 
care outside child’s home. 
c. 10 percent of non-relative care is unpaid paid. 
 
3. Paid relative care: 
a. 28 percent of relative care is paid. 
 
4. Unpaid relative care: 
a. The difference between all relative care and paid relative care. 
Step 3: Apply the Estimated Event Frequencies to the Estimated Populations 
The frequencies of regulated activities described in step one are applied to the estimated populations to 
estimate the number of children affected by the dust wipe testing and clearance requirements. 
5.2.1.3 Estimating Populations of Children Attending Schools in Public or Commercial Building 
COFs 
The population of children attending schools was estimated from the Common Core of Data – Public 
Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey Data (NCES, 2006b).   The building age distribution 
percentages found in the CBECS data were used to calculate the number of children in pre-1978 buildings 
(58 percent). See Chapter 4 of this report for a description of the how the frequencies of RRP, dust wipe 
testing, and clearance were estimated for schools in public or commercial buildings. 
5.2.1.4 Estimating Populations of Children Attending Daycare in Public or Commercial Building 
COFs 
Data from Table 2 of Mulligan et al. (2005) were used to determine the number of children under six 
years of age in childcare centers.  Center-based arrangements include day care centers, Head Start 
programs, preschools, pre-kindergartens, and other early childhood programs.  Table 4 of Mulligan et. al 
indicated that 6,695,000 children were in center-based care.  
To avoid double counting with other structures where childcare is provided, children in center-based 
childcare reported to be in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and target housing settings were removed 
from the daycare center count.  The following adjustments were made:  
1. Subtract from childcare center population the proportion of children in pre-kindergarten and 
kindergarten (27 percent) 
                                                                                                                                                                           
Whenever possible, these daycare facilities and the children they serve were included in the family daycare, 
rather than in daycare center counts.

 Chapter 5 5-8 
2. Subtract from childcare center population the proportion of children in private or target housing 
settings (5 percent)  
The building age distribution percentages found in the CBECS data were used to calculate the number of 
children in pre-1978 buildings (58 percent). 
5.2.2 Estimated Affected Populations 
Table 5-2 through Table 5-5 present the number of individuals affected during the first year of the rule by 
the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule under the three primary options considered in this analysis.  (The 
other three options – third party sampling, dust wipe testing only, and clearance only) protect the same 
number of individuals as the proposed option, although the level of protection may differ.)  The first row 
of these tables presents the number of children who reside in or occupy (i.e., receive childcare or attend 
school in) regulated structures during the first year of the rule. The number of children affected by dust 
wipe testing and clearance activities is both presented separately and combined.  In addition, the tables 
break out the estimated populations according to whether or not the dust wipe testing or clearance applies 
to windows only or to both windows and floors (because when floors are carpeted, the requirements only 
apply to window sills and troughs).

The information provided as a result of the proposed dust wipe testing requirements will generate benefits 
by increasing building owners’ and occupants’ understanding and awareness of dust lead hazards, and 
improving their ability to make further risk management decisions.  The proposed dust wipe testing 
requirements may also change the behavior of renovation firms.  The information from the dust wipe 
testing may help renovation firms to improve their cleaning efficiency by providing feedback on how well 
they are cleaning up after renovations.  In addition, the information provision may result in indirect 
benefits due to behavioral changes by owners and occupants such as performing additional cleaning or 
taking steps to control or remove the lead-based paint.  These behavioral changes can result in additional 
costs as well as in benefits from reductions in exposure.  
Because the current state of knowledge about the economics of information is not highly developed, this 
analysis does not attempt to quantify the direct, informational benefits of the dust wipe testing 
requirements.  In addition, due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the chain of events, this analysis 
does not attempt to predict either the benefits or the costs of the behavioral changes resulting from the 
information provision.   
In addition to information provision, the proposed rule requires additional cleaning to be performed for 
certain jobs where dust levels exceed one of the hazard standards.  However, EPA’s Dust Study (EPA 
2007) did not include these jobs (demolition or removal of plaster through destructive means, and the use 
of machines that remove lead-based paint through high speed operation with HEPA exhaust control).  
This analysis does not quantify the benefits of this additional cleaning because data are not available to 
accurately characterize the dust lead levels generated by these renovation activities, or how they will be 
affected by the proposed Clearance rule’s requirements.    
EPA’s 2008 RRP rule took effect in April 2010, so those requirements are part of the baseline for this 
analysis.  Most of the experiments in EPA’s Dust Study that followed work practices equivalent to those 
required by the 2008 RRP rule resulted in post-verification dust-lead levels that were below the lead 
hazard standard levels developed under TSCA section 403.  But the proportion of Dust Study experiments 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-11 
that exceeded the hazard standard is not a proxy for the fraction of the population that would benefit as a 
result of the proposed rule.  As explained below, without the Clearance rule in place some renovators may 
not be as effective at reducing dust-lead levels as the Dust Study indicates; some of the jobs covered by 
the proposed Clearance rule differ from those in the Dust Study; and exposures to low levels of lead 
(below the hazard standards) can still result in adverse health effects.  Thus, many occupants of target 
housing and COFs where Clearance rule renovations occur may receive some type of benefits. 
First, some renovators following the work practices in the 2008 RRP rule may not achieve the same dust-
lead reductions as the Dust Study indicates.  The Dust Study renovators may have been particularly 
careful in following the work practices because the dust levels were being tested after the work was 
completed.  Since the Clearance rule would require dust wipe testing after the work is completed, the 
results of the Dust Study may be more representative of dust levels with the Clearance rule in place than 
without it. 
Second, the Dust Study did not address all the same job categories as the proposed Clearance rule.  For 
example, the Dust Study did not include the demolition or removal of plaster through destructive means.  
If these Clearance rule jobs generate higher dust-lead levels than the experiments in the Dust Study, or 
leave behind dust particles that are more difficult to clean up because of their fine size or other 
characteristics, then occupants will have higher lead exposures than the Dust Study experiments would 
indicate.     
Finally, it is not appropriate to treat the regulatory hazards standards as a threshold below which there are 
no benefits to reducing lead exposure.  While levels approaching or exceeding the hazard standards are of 
particular concern, it appears that some of the adverse health effects caused by exposure to lead 
(particularly changes in the levels of certain blood enzymes and in aspects of children's neurobehavioral 
development) may occur at blood-lead levels so low as to be essentially without a threshold.  Thus, there 
are health benefits to reducing lead levels to below the hazard standard.  If renovators or consumers 
decide to clean to lead levels below the hazard standard based on the dust wipe testing information, that 
would provide additional health benefits to the occupants.  
Under the proposed rule, reoccupancy of the work area can occur immediately after the dust wipe samples 
are collected.  However, there is a delay between when the samples are taken and when the dust wipe 
testing results are communicated to owners and occupants.  If a fixed site laboratory is used, there may be 
time needed to send the samples to the laboratory; for the laboratory to analyze the samples and return the 
results; for the inspector, risk assessor, or dust sampling technician to prepare a dust wipe testing report 
and provide it to the renovation firm; and for the renovation firm to provide the report to the owner and 
occupants.  
In cases where the occupants re-enter the work area before receiving the dust wipe testing report, and 
where renovators, owners, or occupants act to reduce lead levels or exposures as a result of the 
information, the delay between sampling and the receipt of the report by owners and occupants can 
reduce the health benefits compared to a situation where occupants do not re-enter the work area until 
after the report has been received.   
Preventing occupants in these cases from reoccupying the work area until they receive the testing results 
would create additional benefits due to reduced exposures.  But in some cases the delay while waiting for 
the test results could be significantly longer than the time spent conducting the renovation.  (A covered 
renovation might be completed in as little as a day, while in some cases owners and occupants might not 
receive the test results until a week or more after the samples are taken.)  Preventing occupants from re-
entering the space while the test results are pending would be disruptive and might cause them to incur

additional costs, such as renting alternate space.  This analysis does not estimate the benefits or costs of 
an alternative prohibiting occupancy of the work area until the test results have been received. 
5.3 Lead-Related Health Effects and Ecological Effects 
Lead exposure can cause many adverse health and ecological effects. This section supplements the 
benefits chapter by providing a broader, qualitative discussion of lead-related effects (including adult 
effects and ecological effects), based on EPA’s Air Quality Criteria for Lead. 
The information provided in this section is an excerpt from the Executive Summary of the document Air 
Quality Criteria for Lead (United States Environmental Protection Agency, October 2006, EPA/600/R-
5/144aF, this document is available at http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=158823).  
Specifically, the information provided in this section is directly from the following sections of the

 E.6 Environmental Effects of Lead 
 
5.3.1 Background 
The purpose of the 2006 Lead Air Quality Criteria document (AQCD) is to critically assess the latest 
scientific information on lead.  The final version of the revised Lead AQCD mainly assesses pertinent 
literature published or accepted for publication through December 2005.  
The First External Review Draft (dated December 2005) of the revised Lead AQCD underwent public 
comment and was reviewed by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) at a public 
meeting held in Durham, NC on February 28-March 1, 2006.  The public comments and CASAC 
recommendations received were taken into account in making appropriate revisions and incorporating 
them into a Second External Review Draft (dated May, 2006) which was released for further public 
comment and CASAC review at a public meeting held June 28-29, 2006.  In addition, still further revised 
drafts of the Integrative Synthesis chapter and the Executive Summary were then issued and discussed 
during an August 15, 2006 CASAC teleconference call.  Public comments and CASAC advice received 
on these latter materials, as well as Second External Review Draft materials, were taken into account in 
making and incorporating further revisions into this final version of the Lead AQCD.  
5.3.2 Health Effects Associated with Lead Exposure 
Both epidemiologic and toxicological studies have shown that environmentally relevant levels of lead 
affect many different organ systems.  Research completed since the 1986 AQCD/Addendum and 1990 
Supplement indicates that lead effects occur at blood-lead levels even lower than those previously 
reported for many endpoints.  Remarkable progress has been made since the mid-1980s in understanding 
the Pb effects on health.  Recent studies have focused on details of the associations, including the shapes 
of concentration-response relationships, especially at levels well within the range of general population 
exposures, and on those biological and/or socio-environmental factors that either increase or decrease an 
individual’s risk.  Key findings and conclusions regarding important outcomes of newly available 
toxicological and epidemiologic studies of Pb health effects are highlighted below. 
5.3.2.1 Neurotoxic Effects   
• Neurobehavioral effects of Pb-exposure early in development (during fetal, neonatal, and later 
postnatal periods) in young infants and children (<7 years old) have been observed with 
remarkable consistency across numerous studies involving varying study designs, different 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-13 
developmental assessment protocols, and diverse populations.  Negative Pb impacts on 
neurocognitive ability and other neurobehavioral outcomes are robust in most recent studies even 
after adjustment for numerous potentially confounding factors (including quality of care giving, 
parental intelligence, and socioeconomic status).  These effects generally appear to persist into 
adolescence and young adulthood. 
• The overall weight of the available evidence provides clear substantiation of neurocognitive 
decrements being associated in young children with blood-Pb concentrations in the range of 5-10 
μg/dL, and possibly somewhat lower. Some newly available analyses appear to show Pb effects 
on the intellectual attainment of preschool and school age children at population mean concurrent 
blood-Pb levels ranging down to as low as 2 to 8 μg/dL. A decline of 6.2 points in full scale IQ 
for an increase in concurrent blood Pb levels from 1 to 10 μg/dL has been estimated, based on a 
pooled analysis of results derived from seven well-conducted prospective epidemiologic studies. 
• In the limited literature examining the effects of environmental Pb exposure on adults, mixed 
evidence exists regarding associations between Pb and neurocognitive performance.  No 
associations were observed between cognitive performance and blood Pb levels; however, 
significant associations were observed in relation to bone Pb concentrations, suggesting that long-
term cumulative Pb exposure may contribute to neurocognitive deficits in adults. 
• Animal toxicology data indicate that developmental Pb exposures creating steady-state blood-Pb 
concentrations of ~10 μg/dL result in behavioral impairments that persist into adulthood in rats 
and monkeys. No evident threshold has yet been found; and Pb-induced deficits, for the most 
part, have been found to be very persistent, even with various chelation treatments. However, 
experimental studies indicate that environmental enrichment during development can partially 
mitigate the effects of Pb on cognitive function. In rats, neurobehavioral deficits that persisted 
well into adulthood were observed with prenatal, preweaning, and postweaning Pb exposure. In 
monkeys, such neurobehavioral deficits were observed both with in utero-only exposure and with 
early postnatal-only exposure when peak blood-Pb levels did not exceed 15 μg/dL and steady-
state levels were ~11 μg/dL. 
• Learning impairment has been observed in animal studies at blood levels as low as 10 μg/dL, 
with higher level learning showing greater impairment than simple learning tasks. The 
mechanisms associated with these deficits include: response preservation; insensitivity to changes 
in reinforcement density or contingencies; deficits in attention; reduced ability to inhibit 
inappropriate responding; impulsivity; and distractibility. 
• Lead affects reactivity to the environment and social behavior in both rodents and nonhuman 
primates at blood Pb levels of 15 to 40 μg/dL. Rodent studies also show that Pb exposure 
potentiates the effects of stress in females. 
• Auditory function has also been shown to be impaired at blood Pb levels of 33 μg/dL, while 
visual functions are affected at 19 μg/dL. 
• Neurotoxicological studies in animals clearly demonstrated that Pb mimics calcium and affects 
neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. 
• Epidemiologic studies have identified genetic polymorphisms of two genes that may alter 
susceptibility to the neurodevelopmental consequences of Pb exposure in children. Variant alleles 
of the ALAD gene are associated with differences in absorption, retention, and toxicokinetics of 
Pb. Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor gene have been shown to affect the rate of 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-14 
resorption and excretion of Pb over time. These studies are only suggestive, and parallel animal 
studies have not been completed. 
5.3.2.2 Cardiovascular Effects  
• Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated associations between Pb exposure and 
enhanced risk of deleterious cardiovascular outcomes, including increased blood pressure and 
incidence of hypertension. A meta-analysis of numerous studies estimates that a doubling of 
blood-Pb level (e.g., from 5 to 10 μg/dL) is associated with ~1.0 mm Hg increase in systolic 
blood pressure and ~0.6 mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure. Studies have also found that 
cumulative past Pb exposure (e.g., bone Pb) may be as important, if not more, than present Pb 
exposure in assessing cardiovascular effects. The evidence for an association of Pb with 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is limited but supportive. 
• Experimental toxicology studies have confirmed Pb effects on cardiovascular functions.  Most 
have shown that exposures creating blood-Pb levels of ~20 to 30 μg/dL for long periods result in 
arterial hypertension that persists long after cessation of Pb exposure in genetically normal 
animals. One study reported blood pressure increases at blood-Pb levels as low as 2 μg/dL in rats. 
A number of in vivo and in vitro studies provide compelling evidence for the role of oxidative 
stress in the pathogenesis of Pb-induced hypertension.  However, experimental investigations of 
cardiovascular effects of Pb in animals are unclear as to why low, but not high, levels of Pb 
exposure cause hypertension in experimental animals. 
5.3.2.3 Renal Effects 
• In the general population, both circulating and cumulative Pb was found to be associated with 
longitudinal decline in renal function. Effects on creatine clearance have been reported in human 
adult hypertensives to be associated with general population mean blood-Pb levels of only 4.2 
μg/dL. The public health significance of such effects is not clear, however, in view of more 
serious signs of kidney dysfunction being seen in occupationally exposed workers only at much 
higher blood-Pb levels (>30-40 μg/dL). 
• Experimental studies using laboratory animals demonstrated that the initial accumulation of 
absorbed Pb occurs primarily in the kidneys. This takes place mainly through glomerular 
filtration and subsequent reabsorption, and, to a small extent, through direct absorption from the 
blood. Both low dose Pb-treated animals and high dose Pb-treated animals showed a 
“hyperfiltration” phenomenon during the first 3 months of Pb exposure. Investigations into 
biochemical alterations in Pb-induced renal toxicity suggested a role for oxidative stress and 
involvement of NO, with a significant increase in nitrotyrosine and substantial fall in urinary 
excretion of NOx. 
• Iron deficiency increases intestinal absorption of Pb and the Pb content of soft tissues and bone. 
Aluminum decreases kidney Pb content and serum creatinine in Pb-intoxicated animals. Age also 
has an effect on Pb retention. There is higher Pb retention at a very young age and lower bone and 
kidney Pb at old age, attributed in part to increased bone resorption and decreased bone accretion 
and, also, kidney Pb. 
5.3.2.4 Immune System Effects 
• Findings from recent epidemiologic studies suggest that Pb exposure may be associated with 
effects on cellular and humoral immunity. These include changes in serum immunoglobulin 
levels. Studies of biomarkers of humoral immunity in children have consistently found significant 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-15 
associations between increasing blood-Pb concentrations and serum IgE levels at blood-Pb levels 
<10 μg/dL. 
• Toxicologic studies have shown that Pb targets immune cells, causing suppression of delayed 
type hypersensitivity response, elevation of IgE, and modulation of macrophages into a hyper-
inflammatory phenotype. These types of changes can cause increased risk of atopy, asthma, and 
some forms of autoimmunity and reduced resistance to some infectious diseases. Lead exposure 
of embryos resulting in blood-Pb levels <10 μg/dL can produce persistent later-life 
immunotoxicity. 
5.3.2.5 Effects on Heme Synthesis 
• Lead exposure has been associated with disruption of heme synthesis in both children and adults. 
A 10% probability of anemia (hematocrit <35%) is estimated to be associated with a blood-Pb 
level of ~20 μg/dL at age 1 year. Increases in blood Pb concentration of about 20-30 μg/dL are 
sufficient to halve erythrocyte ALAD activity and sufficiently inhibit ferrochelatase to double 
erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. 
• Toxicological studies demonstrated that Pb intoxication interferes with red blood cell (RBC) 
survival and alters RBC mobility. Hematological parameters, such as mean corpuscular volume, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, are also 
significantly decreased upon exposure to Pb. These effects are due to internalization of Pb by 
RBC. The transport of Pb across the RBC membrane is energy-independent and carrier-mediated; 
and the uptake of Pb appears to be mediated by an anion exchanger through a vanadate-sensitive 
pathway. 
• Erythrocyte ALAD activity ratio (ratio of activated/non activated enzyme activity) has been 
shown to be a sensitive, dose-responsive measure of Pb exposure, regardless of the mode of 
administration of Pb. Competitive enzyme kinetic analyses in RBCs from both humans and 
Cynomolgus monkeys indicated similar inhibition profiles by Pb. 
5.3.2.6 Effects on Bones and Teeth 
• Experimental studies in animals demonstrate that Pb substitutes for calcium and is readily taken 
up and stored in the bone and teeth of animals, potentially allowing bone cell function to be 
compromised both directly and indirectly by exposure.  Relatively short-term exposure of mature 
animals to Pb does not result in significant growth suppression. However, chronic Pb exposure 
during times of inadequate nutrition has been shown to adversely influence bone growth, 
including decreased bone density, decreased trabecular bone, and growth plates. 
• Exposure of developing animals to Pb during gestation and the immediate postnatal period has 
clearly been shown to significantly depress early bone growth in a dose-dependent fashion, 
though this effect is not manifest below a certain threshold. 
• Systemically, Pb has been shown to disrupt mineralization of bone during growth, to alter 
calcium binding proteins, and to increase calcium and phosphorus concentration in the blood 
stream, in addition to potentially altering bone cell differentiation and function by altering plasma 
levels of growth hormone and calciotropic hormones such as vitamin D3 [1,25- (OH2)D3. 
• Periods of extensive bone remodeling, such as occur during weight loss, advanced age, altered 
metabolic state, and pregnancy and lactation are all associated with mobilization of Pb stores 
from bone of animals.

 Chapter 5 5-16 
• Numerous epidemiologic studies and, separately, animal studies (both post-eruptive Pb exposure 
and pre- and perinatal Pb exposure studies) suggest that Pb is a caries-promoting element. 
However, whether Pb incorporation into the enamel surface compromises the integrity and 
resistance of the surface to dissolution, and ultimately increases risk of dental decay, is unclear. 
• Increased risk of dental caries has been associated with Pb exposure in children and adults. Lead 
effects on caries were observed in populations whose mean blood-Pb levels were less than 10 
μg/dL. 
5.3.2.7 Reproductive and Developmental Effects 
• Epidemiologic evidence suggests small associations between Pb exposure and male reproductive 
outcomes, including perturbed semen quality and increased time to pregnancy.  There are no 
adequate epidemiologic data to evaluate associations between Pb exposure and female fertility. 
Most studies have yielded no associations, or weak associations, of Pb exposure with thyroid 
hormone status and male reproductive endocrine status in highly exposed occupational 
populations. 
• New toxicologic studies support earlier conclusions, presented in the 1986 Lead AQCD, that (a) 
Pb can produce both temporary and persisting effects on male and female reproductive function 
and development and (b) Pb disrupts endocrine function at multiple points along the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Although there is evidence for a common mode of action, 
consistent effects on circulating testosterone levels are not always observed in Pb-exposed 
animals. Inconsistencies in reports of circulating testosterone levels complicate derivation of a 
dose-response relationship for this endpoint. 
• Lead-induced testicular damage (ultrastructural changes in testes of monkeys at blood-Pb >35 to 
40 μg/dL) and altered female sex hormone release, imprinting during early development, and 
altered female fertility all suggest Pb-induced reproductive effects. However, Pb exposure does 
not generally produce total sterility. Pre- and postnatal exposure to Pb has been demonstrated to 
result in fetal mortality and produce a variety of sublethal effects in the offspring. Many of the 
Pb-induced sublethal developmental effects occur at maternal blood-Pb levels that do not result in 
clinical (overt) toxicity in the mothers. Teratogenic effects resulting from Pb exposure reported in 
a few studies appear to be confounded by maternal toxicity. 
5.3.2.8 Effects on Other Organ Systems 
• Lead impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, elevating corticosterone levels and altering 
stress responsivity. This may be a potential mechanism contributing to Pb-induced hypertension, 
with further possible roles in the etiology of diabetes, obesity and other disorders.   
• Studies of hepatic enzyme levels in serum suggest that liver injury may be present in Pb workers; 
however, associations specifically with Pb exposures are not evident. Children exposed to 
relatively high levels of Pb (blood Pb >30 μg/dL) exhibit depressed levels of circulating 1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25-OH-D).  However, associations between serum vitamin D status and 
blood Pb were not evident in a study of calcium-replete children who had average lifetime blood-
Pb concentrations <25 μg/dL. 
• Field studies that evaluated hepatic enzyme levels in serum suggest that liver injury may be 
present in Pb workers; however, associations specifically with Pb exposures have not been well 
established.

 Chapter 5 5-17 
• Simultaneous induction of the activities of phase II drug metabolizing enzymes and decreased 
phase I enzymes with a single exposure to Pb nitrate in rat liver suggest that Pb is capable of 
causing biochemical phenotype similar to hepatic nodules. 
• Newer studies examined the induction of GST-P at both transcriptional and translational levels 
using in vitro systems and indicated a role for Pb-nitrate and Pb-acetate in the induction process.  
• Lead-induced alterations in cholesterol metabolism appear to be mediated by the induction of 
several enzymes related to cholesterol metabolism and the decrease of 7 α-hydroxylase, a 
cholesterol-catabolizing enzyme. This regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is modulated by 
changes in cytokine expression and related signaling. 
• Newer experimental evidence suggests that Pb-induced alterations in liver heme metabolism 
involve perturbations in ALAD activity, porphyrin metabolism, alterations in Transferrin gene 
expression, and associated changes in iron metabolism. 
• Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of Pb is influenced by a variety of factors, including chemical 
and physical forms of the element in ingested media, age at intake, and various nutritional factors. 
The degeneration of intestinal mucosal epithelium leading to potential malabsorption and 
alterations in the jejunal ultrastructure (possibly associated with distortion of glycocalyx layer) 
have been reported in the intestine of Pb-exposed rats. 
• Nutritional studies that varied Pb, Ca, and vitamin D levels in the diet have demonstrated 
competition of Pb with Ca absorption. Supplementation with vitamin D has been reported to 
enhance intestinal absorption of Ca and Pb. Physiological amounts of vitamin D, when 
administered to vitamin D-deficient rats, resulted in elevated Pb and Ca levels.  In the case of 
severe Ca deficiency, Pb ingestion results in a marked decrease in serum 1,25 hydroxy vitamin D. 
5.3.2.9 Genotoxic and Carcinogenic Effects 
• Epidemiologic studies of highly exposed occupational populations suggest a relationship between 
Pb and cancers of the lung and the stomach; however the evidence is limited by the presence of 
various potential confounders, including metal coexposures (e.g., to arsenic, cadmium), smoking, 
and dietary habits. The 2003 NTP and 2004 IARC reviews concluded that Pb and Pb compounds 
were probable carcinogens, based on limited evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in 
animals. Similarly, Pb and Pb compounds would likely be classified as likely to be carcinogenic 
to humans according to the new 2005 EPA Cancer Assessment Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk 
Assessment, based on animal data even though the human data are inadequate. 
• Studies of genotoxicity consistently find associations of Pb exposure with DNA damage and 
micronuclei formation; however, the associations with the more established indicator of cancer 
risk, chromosomal aberrations, are inconsistent. 
• Pb is an animal carcinogen and extends our understanding of mechanisms involved to include a 
role for metallothionein. Specifically, the recent data show that metallothionein may participate in 
Pb inclusion bodies and, thus, serves to prevent or reduce Pb-induced tumorigenesis. 
• In vitro cell culture studies that evaluated the potential for Pb to transform rodent cells are 
inconsistent, and careful study of a time course of exposure is necessary to determine whether Pb 
actually induces transformation in cultured rodent cells. There is increased evidence suggesting 
that Pb may be co-carcinogenic or promotes the carcinogenicity of other compounds. Cell culture 
studies do support a possible epigenetic mechanism or co-mutagenic effects.

 Chapter 5 5-18 
5.3.2.10 Lead-Binding Proteins 
• Proteins depending upon sulfur-containing side chains for maintaining conformity or activity are 
vulnerable to inactivation by Pb, due to its strong sulfur-binding affinity. 
• The enzyme, ALAD, a 280 kDa protein, is inducible and is the major Pb-binding protein within 
the erythrocyte. 
• The Pb-binding protein in rat kidney has been identified as a cleavage product of α-2-
microglobulin. The low molecular weight Pb-binding proteins in human kidney have been 
identified as thymosin β 4 (molecular weight 5 kDa) and acyl-CoA binding protein (molecular 
weight 9 kDa). In human brain, Pb-binding proteins include thymosin β4 and an unidentified 
protein of 23 kDa.   
• Animal toxicology studies with metallothionein-null mice demonstrated a possible role for 
metallothionein as a renal Pb-binding protein. 
5.3.2.11 Human Population Groups At Special Risk And Potential Public Health Impacts 
• Children, in general and especially low SES (often including larger proportions of African-
American and Hispanic) children, have been well-documented as being at increased risk for Pb 
exposure and Pb-induced adverse health effects. This is due to several factors, including 
enhanced exposure to Pb via ingestion of soil-Pb and/or dust-Pb due to normal hand-to-mouth 
activity and/or pica. 
• Even children with low Pb exposure levels (having blood Pb of 5-10 μg/dL or, possibly, 
somewhat lower) are at notable risk, due to apparent non-linear dose-response relationships 
between blood Pb and neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is hypothesized that initial 
neurodevelopmental lesions occurring at blood-Pb levels <10 μg/dL may disrupt different 
developmental processes in the nervous system than more severe high level exposures. 
• Adults with idiosyncratic exposures to Pb through occupations, hobbies, make-up use, glazed 
pottery, native medicines, and other sources are at risk for Pb toxicity. Certain ethnic and racial 
groups are known to have cultural practices that involve ingestion of Pb-containing substances, 
e.g., ingestion of foods or beverages stored in Pb-glazed pottery or imported canned food from 
countries that allow Pb-soldered cans. 
• Cumulative past Pb exposure, measured by bone Pb, may be a better predictor of cardiovascular 
effects than current blood-Pb levels. African-Americans are known to have substantially higher 
baseline blood pressure than other ethnic groups, so Pb’s impact on an already higher baseline 
could indicate a greater susceptibility to Pb for this group. 
• Effects on adults of low-level Pb exposures also include some renal effects (i.e., altered creatinine 
clearance) at blood-Pb levels <5 ug/dL. Lead exposure combined with other risk factors, such as 
diabetes, hypertension, or chronic renal insufficiency may result in clinically relevant effects in 
individuals with two or more other risk factors. 
• At least two genetic polymorphisms, of the ALAD and the vitamin D receptor gene, have been 
suggested to play a role in susceptibility to Pb. In one study, African-American children were 
found to have a higher incidence of being homozygous for alleles of the vitamin D receptor gene 
thought to contribute to greater Pb blood levels. This work is preliminary and further studies will 
be necessary to determine implications of genetic differences that may make certain populations 
more susceptible to Pb exposure. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-19 
• What was considered “low” for Pb exposure levels in the 1980s is an order of magnitude higher 
than the current mean level in the U.S. population, and current average blood-Pb levels in U.S. 
populations remain perhaps as much as two orders of magnitude above preindustrial “natural” 
levels in humans. There is no level of Pb exposure that has yet been identified, with confidence, 
as being clearly not being associated with possible risk of deleterious health effects. Some recent 
studies of Pb neurotoxicity in infants have observed effects at population average blood-Pb levels 
of only 1 or 2 μg/dL; and some cardiovascular, renal, and immune outcomes have been reported 
at blood-Pb levels below 5 μg/dL. 
• Public health interventions have resulted in declines, over the last 25 years, of more than 90% in 
the mean blood-Pb level within all age and gender subgroups of the U.S. population, substantially 
decreasing the numbers of individuals at likely risk for Pb-induced toxicities. Nevertheless, 
estimates of the magnitude of potential public health impacts of Pb exposure can be substantial 
for the U.S. population. For example, in estimating the effect of Pb exposure on intelligence, it 
was projected that the fraction of individuals with an IQ >120 would decrease from ~9% with no 
Pb exposure to less than 3% at a blood-Pb level of 10 μg/dL. Also, the fraction of individuals 
with an IQ >130 points was estimated as being likely to decrease from 2.25% to 0.5% with a 
blood-Pb level change from 0 to 10 μg/dL.  In addition, an estimate of hypertension-related risk 
for serious cardiovascular events (coronary disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, cardiac 
failure) indicates that a decrease in blood Pb from 10 to 5 μg/dL could result in an annual 
decrease of 27 events per 100,000 women and 39 events per 100,000 men. 
5.3.3 Environmental Effects of Lead 
5.3.3.1 Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Methodologies Used in Terrestrial Ecosystem Research 
• Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) techniques provide the greatest information on metal 
speciation. Other techniques, such as EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) and 
EXANES (extended X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), show great promise and will be 
important in solving key mechanistic questions. 
• In situ methodologies have been developed to lower soil-Pb relative bioavailability. These 
amendments typically fall within the categories of phosphate, biosolid, and Al/Fe/Mn-oxide 
amendments. Some of the drawbacks to soil amendment include phosphate toxicity to plants and 
increased arsenic mobility at high soil phosphate concentrations. The use of iron (III) phosphate 
seems to mitigate arsenic mobility, however increased concentrations of phosphate and iron limit 
their application when drinking water quality is a concern. 
Distribution of Atmospherically Delivered Lead in Terrestrial Ecosystems 
• Total Pb deposition during the 20th century has been estimated at 1 to 3 g Pb m-2, depending on 
elevation and proximity to urban areas. Total contemporary loadings to terrestrial ecosystems are 
~1 to 2 mg m-2 year-1. This is a relatively small annual flux of Pb compared to the reservoir of 
~0.5 to 4 g m-2 of gasoline additive-derived Pb already deposited in surface soils over much of the 
United States. 
• Dry deposition can account for 10% to >90% of total Pb deposition. Because Clean Air Act 
Legislation has preferentially reduced Pb associated with fine particles, relative contributions of 
dry deposition have changed in the last few decades. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-20 
• Although inputs of Pb to ecosystems are currently low, Pb export from watersheds via 
groundwater and streams is substantially lower than inputs. Therefore, even at current input 
levels, watersheds are accumulating anthropogenic Pb. 
• Species of Pb delivered to terrestrial ecosystems can be inferred by emission source. For example, 
Pb species emitted from automobile exhaust are dominated by particulate Pb halides and double 
salts with ammonium halides (e.g., PbBrCl, PbBrCl2NH4Cl), while Pb emitted from smelters is 
dominated by Pb-sulfur species. Halides from automobile exhaust break down rapidly in the 
atmosphere, via redox reactions in the presence of atmospheric acids. Lead phases in the 
atmosphere, and presumably the compounds delivered to the surface of the earth (i.e., to 
vegetation and soils), are suspected to be in the form of PbSO4, PbS, and PbO. 
• The importance of humic and fulvic acids and hydrous Mn- and Fe-oxides for scavenging Pb in 
soils was discussed in some detail in the 1986 Lead AQCD. The importance of these Pb binding 
substrates is reinforced by studies reported in the more contemporary literature. 
• The amount of Pb that has leached into mineral soil appears to be on the order of 20 to 50% of the 
total anthropogenic Pb deposition. 
• The vertical distribution and mobility of atmospheric Pb in soils was poorly documented prior to 
1986. Techniques using radiogenic Pb isotopes have been developed to differentiate between 
gasoline-derived Pb and natural, geogenic (native) Pb. These techniques provide more accurate 
determinations of the depth-distribution and potential migration velocities for atmospherically 
delivered Pb in soils.  
• Selective chemical extractions have been used extensively over the past 20 years to quantify 
amounts of a particular metal phase in soil or sediment rather than total metal concentration. 
However, some problems persist with the selective extraction technique: (a) extractions are rarely 
specific to a single phase; and (b) in addition to the nonselectivity of reagents, significant metal 
redistribution has been found to occur during sequential chemical extractions. Thus, although 
chemical extractions provide some useful information on metal phases in soil or sediment, the 
results should be treated as “operationally defined,” e.g., “H2O2-liberated Pb” rather than “organic 
Pb.” 
• Soil solution dissolved organic matter content and pH typically have very strong positive and 
negative correlations, respectively, with the concentration of dissolved Pb species. 
Effects of Lead on Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems 
• Atmospheric Pb pollution has resulted in the accumulation of Pb in terrestrial ecosystems 
throughout the world. In the United States, anthropogenically-derived Pb represents a significant 
fraction of the total Pb burden in soils, even in sites remote from smelters and other industrial 
plants. However, few significant effects of Pb pollution have been observed at sites that are not 
near point sources of Pb. 
• Evidence from precipitation collection and sediment analyses indicates that atmospheric 
deposition of Pb has declined dramatically (>95%) at sites unaffected by point sources of Pb, and 
there is little evidence that Pb accumulated in soils at these sites represents a threat to ground 
water or surface water supplies. 
• The effects of Pb and other chemical emissions on terrestrial ecosystems near smelters and other 
industrial sites decrease downwind from the Pb source. Several studies using the soil burden as an 
indicator have shown that much of the contamination occurs within a radius of 20 to 50 km 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-21 
around the emission source. Elevated metal concentrations around smelters have been found to 
persist despite significant reductions in emissions. The concentrations of Pb in soils, vegetation, 
and fauna at these sites can be two to three orders of magnitude higher than in reference areas. 
Assessing the risks specifically associated with Pb is difficult, because these sites also experience 
elevated concentrations of other metals and because of effects related to SO2 emissions. The 
confounding effect of other pollutants makes the assessment of Pb-specific exposure-response 
relationships impossible at the whole ecosystem level. 
• In the most extreme cases, near smelter sites, the death of vegetation causes a near-complete 
collapse of the detrital food web, creating a terrestrial ecosystem in which energy and nutrient 
flows are minimal. 
• More commonly, stress in soil microorganisms and detritivores can cause reductions in the rate of 
decomposition of detrital organic matter. Although there is little evidence of significant 
bioaccumulation of Pb in natural terrestrial ecosystems, reductions in microbial and detritivorous 
populations can affect the success of their predators. Thus, at present, industrial point sources 
represent the greatest Pb-related threat to the maintenance of sustainable, healthy, diverse, and 
high-functioning terrestrial ecosystems in the United States. 
Terrestrial Species Response/Mode of Action 
• Plants take up Pb via their foliage and through their root systems. Surface deposition of Pb onto 
plants may represent a significant contribution to the total Pb in and on the plant, as has been 
observed for plants near smelters and along roadsides.  
• There are two possible mechanisms (symplastic or apoplastic) by which Pb may enter the root of 
a plant. The symplastic route is through the cell membranes of root hairs; this is the mechanism of 
uptake for water and nutrients. The apoplastic route is an extracellular route between epidermal 
cells into the intercellular spaces of the root cortex. The symplastic route is considered the 
primary mechanism of Pb uptake in plants. 
• Recent work supports previous conclusions that the form of metal tested, and its speciation in 
soil, influence uptake and toxicity to plants and invertebrates. The oxide form of Pb is less toxic 
than the chloride or acetate forms, which are less toxic that the nitrate form of Pb. However, these 
results must be interpreted with caution, as the counter ion (e.g., the nitrate ion) may also be 
contributing to the observed toxicity. 
• Lead may be detoxified in plants by deposition in root cell walls, and this may be influenced by 
calcium concentrations. Other hypotheses put forward recently include the presence of sulfur 
ligands and the sequestration of Pb in old leaves as detoxification mechanisms. Lead 
detoxification has not been studied extensively in invertebrates. Glutathione detoxification 
enzymes were measured in two species of spider. Lead may be stored in waste nodules in 
earthworms or as pyromorphite in the nematode. 
• Lead effects on heme synthesis (as measured primarily by ALAD activity and protoporphyrin 
concentration) were documented in the 1986 Lead AQCD and continue to be studied. However, 
researchers caution that changes in ALAD and other enzyme parameters are not always related to 
adverse effects, but may simply indicate exposure. Other effects on plasma enzymes, which may 
damage other organs, have been reported. Lead also may cause lipid peroxidation, which may be 
alleviated by vitamin E, although Pb poisoning may still result.  Changes in fatty acid production 
have been reported, which may influence immune response and bone formation.

• Insectivorous mammals may be more exposed to Pb than herbivores, and higher trophic-level 
consumers may be less exposed than lower trophic-level organisms. Nutritionally deficient diets 
(including low calcium) cause increased uptake of Pb and greater toxicity in birds. 
• Interactions of Pb with other metals are inconsistent, depending on the endpoint measured, the 
tissue analyzed, the animal species, and the metal combination. 
Exposure/Response of Terrestrial Species 
• Recent critical advancements reported in the current Lead AQCD in understanding toxicity levels 
relies heavily on the work completed by a multi-stakeholder group, consisting of federal, state, 
consulting, industry, and academic participants, led by the EPA to develop Ecological Soil 
Screening Levels (Eco-SSLs). 
• Eco-SSLs are concentrations of contaminants in soils that would result in little or no measurable 
effect on ecological receptors. The Eco-SSLs are intentionally conservative in order to provide 
confidence that contaminants that could present an unacceptable risk are not screened out early in 
the evaluation process. That is, at or below these levels, adverse effects are considered unlikely. 
Due to conservative modeling assumptions (e.g., metal exists in most toxic form or highly 
bioavailable form, high food ingestion rate, high soil ingestion rate) that are common to screening 
processes, several Eco-SSLs are derived below the average background soil concentration for a 
particular contaminant. 
• The Eco-SSLs for terrestrial plants, birds, mammals, and soil invertebrates are 120, 11, 56, and 
1700 mg Pb/kg soil, respectively. 
5.3.3.2 Aquatic Ecosystems 
Methodologies Used in Aquatic Ecosystem Research 
• Many of the terrestrial methods can also be applied to suspended solids and sediments collected 
from aquatic ecosystems. Just as in the terrestrial environment, the speciation of Pb and other 
trace metals in natural freshwaters and seawater plays a crucial role in determining their 
reactivity, mobility, bioavailability, and toxicity. Many of the same speciation techniques 
employed for the speciation of Pb in terrestrial ecosystems are applicable in aquatic ecosystems. 
• There is now a better understanding of the potential effects of sampling, sample handling, and 
sample preparation on aqueous-phase metal speciation. Thus, a need has arisen for dynamic 
analytical techniques that are able to capture a metal's speciation, in-situ and in real time. 
• With few exceptions, ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) are derived based on data from 
aquatic toxicity studies conducted in the laboratory. In general, both acute (short term) and 
chronic (long term) AWQCs are developed. Depending on the species, the toxicity studies 
considered for developing acute criteria range in length from 48 to 96 hours. 
• Acceptable chronic toxicity studies should encompass the full life cycle of the test organism, 
although for fish, early life stage or partial life cycle toxicity studies are considered acceptable. 
Acceptable endpoints include reproduction, growth and development, and survival, with the 
effect levels expressed as the chronic value. 
• The biotic ligand model (BLM), which considers the binding of free metal ion to the site of toxic 
action and competition between metal species and other ions, has been developed to predict the 
toxicity of several metals under a variety of water quality conditions. However, there are 
limitations to this tool in deriving AWQC because, currently, limited work has been conducted in 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-23 
developing chronic BLMs (for any metals, let alone Pb) and the acute BLMs to date do not 
account for dietary metal exposures. 
Distribution of Lead in Aquatic Ecosystems 
• Atmospheric Pb is delivered to aquatic ecosystems primarily through deposition (wet and/or dry) 
or through erosional transport of soil particles. 
• A significant portion of Pb in the aquatic environment exists in the undissolved form (i.e., bound 
to suspended particulate matter). The ratio of Pb in suspended solids to Pb in filtrate varies from 
4:1 in rural streams to 27:1 in urban streams. 
• The oxidation potential of Pb is high in slightly acidic solutions, and Pb2+ binds with high affinity 
to sulfur-, oxygen-, and nitrogen-containing ligands. Therefore, speciation of Pb in the aquatic 
environment is controlled by many factors (e.g., pH, redox, dissolved organic carbon, sulfides). 
The primary form of Pb in aquatic environments is divalent (Pb2+), while Pb4+ exists only under 
extreme oxidizing conditions. Labile forms of Pb (e.g., Pb2+, PbOH+, PbCO3) are a significant 
portion of the Pb inputs to aquatic systems from atmospheric washout. Lead is typically present in 
acidic aquatic environments as PbSO4, PbCl4, ionic Pb, cationic forms of Pb-hydroxide, and 
ordinary Pb-hydroxide (Pb(OH)2). In alkaline waters, common species of Pb include anionic 
forms of Pb-carbonate (Pb(CO3)) and Pb(OH)2.  
• Lead concentrations in lakes and oceans were generally found to be much lower than those 
measured in the lotic waters assessed by NAWQA. In open waters of the North Atlantic the 
decline of Pb concentrations has been associated with the phasing out of leaded gasoline in North 
America and Western Europe. However, in estuarine systems, it appears that similar declines 
following the phase-out of leaded gasoline are not necessarily as rapid.  
• Based on a synthesis of NAWQA data from the United States, Pb concentrations in surface 
waters, sediments, and fish tissues (whole body) respectively range from: 0.04 to 30 μg/L (mean 
= 0.66, median = 0.50, 95th %tile = 1.1); 0.5 to 12,000 mg/kg (mean = 120, median = 28, 95th 
%tile = 200); and 0.08 to 23 mg/kg (mean = 1.03, median = 0.59, 95th %tile = 3.24). 
Effects of Lead on Natural Aquatic Ecosystems 
• Lead exposure may adversely affect organisms at different levels of organization, i.e., individual 
organisms, populations, communities, or ecosystems. Generally, however, there is insufficient 
information available for single materials in controlled studies to permit evaluation of specific 
impacts on higher levels of organization (beyond the individual organism). Potential effects at the 
population level or higher are, of necessity, extrapolated from individual level studies. Available 
population, community, or ecosystem level studies are typically conducted at sites that have been 
contaminated or adversely affected by multiple stressors (several chemicals alone or combined 
with physical or biological stressors). Therefore, the best-documented links between Pb and 
effects on the environment are with effects on individual organisms. 
• Natural systems frequently contain multiple metals, making it difficult to attribute observed 
adverse effects to single metals. For example, macro invertebrate communities have been widely 
studied with respect to metals contamination and community composition and species richness. In 
these studies, multiple metals were evaluated and correlations between observed community level 
effects were ascertained. The results often indicate a correlation between the presence of one or 
more metals (or total metals) and the negative effects observed. While, correlation may imply a 
relationship between two variables, it does not imply causation of effects. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-24 
• In simulated microcosms or natural systems, environmental exposure to Pb in water and sediment 
has been shown to affect energy flow and nutrient cycling and benthic community structure.  
• In field studies, Pb contamination has been shown to significantly alter the aquatic environment 
through bioaccumulation and alterations of community structure and function.   
• Exposure to Pb in laboratory studies and simulated ecosystems may alter species competitive 
behaviors, predator-prey interactions, and contaminant avoidance behaviors. Alteration of these 
interactions may have negative effects on species abundance and community structure.  
• In natural aquatic ecosystems, Pb is often found coexisting with other metals and other stressors. 
Thus, understanding the effects of Pb in natural systems is challenging given that observed effects 
may be due to cumulative toxicity from multiple stressors. 
Aquatic Species Response/Mode of Action 
• Recent research has suggested that due to the low solubility of Pb in water, dietary Pb (i.e., Pb 
adsorbed to sediment, particulate matter, and food) may contribute substantially to exposure and 
toxicity in aquatic biota.   
• Generally speaking, aquatic organisms exhibit three Pb accumulation strategies: (1) accumulation 
of significant Pb concentrations with a low rate of loss, (2) excretion of Pb roughly in balance 
with availability of metal in the environment, and (3) weak net accumulation due to very low 
metal uptake rate and no significant excretion.  
• Protists and plants produce intracellular polypeptides that form complexes with Pb.  Macrophytes 
and wetland plants that thrive in Pb-contaminated regions have developed translocation strategies 
for tolerance and detoxification. 
• Like aquatic plants and protists, aquatic animals detoxify Pb by preventing it from being 
metabolically available, though their mechanisms for doing so vary. Invertebrates use lysosomal-
vacuolar systems to sequester and process Pb within glandular cells. They also accumulate Pb as 
deposits on and within skeletal tissue, and some can efficiently excrete Pb. Fish scales and 
mucous chelate Pb in the water column, and potentially reduce visceral exposure.   
• Numerous studies have reported the effects of Pb exposure on blood chemistry in aquatic biota. 
Plasma cholesterol, blood serum protein, albumin, and globulin concentrations were identified as 
bioindicators of Pb stress in fish. 
• Nutrients affect Pb toxicity in aquatic organisms. Some nutrients seem capable of reducing 
toxicity. Exposure to Pb has not been shown to reduce nutrient uptake ability, though it has been 
demonstrated that Pb exposure may lead to increased production and loss of organic material 
(e.g., mucus and other complex organic ligands). 
• Avoidance responses are actions performed to evade a perceived threat. Some aquatic organisms 
have been shown to be quite adept at avoiding Pb in aquatic systems, while others seem incapable 
of detecting its presence. 
• The two most commonly reported Pb-element interactions are between Pb and calcium and 
between Pb and zinc. Both calcium and zinc are essential elements in organisms and the 
interaction of Pb with these ions can lead to adverse effects both by increased Pb uptake and by a 
decrease in Ca and Zn required for normal metabolic functions. 
Exposure/Response of Aquatic Species 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 5 5-25 
• The 1986 Lead AQCD reviewed data in the context of sublethal effects of Pb exposure. The 
document focused on describing the types and ranges of Pb exposures in ecosystems likely to 
adversely impact domestic animals. As such, the 1986 AQCD did not provide a comprehensive 
analysis of the effects of Pb to most aquatic primary producers, consumers, and decomposers. 
• Waterborne Pb is highly toxic to aquatic organisms, with toxicity varying with the species and 
life stage tested, duration of exposure, form of Pb tested, and water quality characteristics. 
• Among the species tested, aquatic invertebrates, such as amphipods and water fleas, were the 
most sensitive to the effects of Pb, with adverse effects being reported at concentrations as low as 
0.45 μg/L (range: 0.45 to 8000 μg/L).   
• Freshwater fish demonstrated adverse effects at concentrations ranging from 10 to >5400 μg/L, 
depending generally upon water quality parameters. 
• Amphibians tend to be relatively Pb tolerant; however, they may exhibit decreased enzyme 
activity (e.g., ALAD reduction) and changes in behavior (e.g., hypoxia response behavior). 
5.3.3.3 Critical Loads for Lead in Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecosystems 
• Critical loads are defined as threshold deposition rates of air pollutants that current knowledge 
indicates will not cause long-term adverse effects to ecosystem structure and function. A critical 
load is related to an ecosystem's sensitivity to anthropogenic inputs of a specific chemical. 
• The critical loads approach for sensitive ecosystems from acidification has been in use throughout 
Europe for about 20 years. Its application to Pb and other heavy metals in Europe is more recent. 
European critical load values for Pb have been developed but are highly specific to the bedrock 
geology, soil types, vegetation, and historical deposition trends in each European country. To 
date, the critical loads framework has not been used for regulatory purposes in the United States 
for any chemical. Considerable research is necessary before critical load estimates can be 
formulated for ecosystems extant in the United States. 
• Speciation strongly influences the toxicity of Pb in soil and water and partitioning between 
dissolved and solid phases determines the concentration of Pb in soil drainage water, but it has 
not been taken into account in most of the critical load calculations for Pb performed to date.  
• Runoff of Pb from soil may be the major source of Pb into aquatic systems. However, little 
attempt has been made to include this source into critical load calculations for aquatic systems 
due to the complexity of including this source in the critical load models. 
In summary, due to the deposition of Pb from past practices (e.g., leaded gasoline, ore smelting) and the 
long residence time of Pb in many aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, a legacy of environmental Pb 
burden exists, over which is superimposed much lower contemporary Pb loadings. The potential for 
ecological effects of the combined legacy and contemporary Pb burden to occur is a function of the 
bioavailability or bioaccessibility of the Pb, which, in turn, is highly dependent upon numerous site 
factors (e.g., soil organic carbon content, pH, water hardness). Moreover, while the more localized 
ecosystem impacts observed around smelters are often striking, these perturbations cannot be attributed 
solely to Pb. Many other stressors (e.g., other heavy metals, oxides of sulfur and nitrogen) can also act 
singly or in concert with Pb to cause such notable environmental impacts.

6. Estimated Impacts of the Lead, Renovation, Repair, and Painting 
Rule Revisions 
In addition to the cost and benefit analyses presented in Chapters 4 and 5, several other types of impacts 
are important to consider in evaluating the effects of a regulation.  This chapter presents the incremental 
impact of the proposed revisions to the Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (LRRP) Rule on: 
• Paperwork burden, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
• Financial condition of small entities, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
• Whether the regulation has a disproportionate effect on low-income and or minority persons 
•  The environmental health risk or safety risk to children due to the regulation, as required by 
Executive Order 13045–Protection of Children From Environmental Health & Safety Risks 
• State, local, and Tribal governments, and the private sector, as required by Executive Order 
13175–Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments 
• Federalism, as required by Executive Order 13132–Federalism 
• The relationship between the Federal government and the Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the Federal government and Indian tribes 
• Energy effects, as required by Executive Order 13211–Actions That Significantly Affect Energy 
Supply, Distribution, or Use and  
• Whether voluntary consensus standards are used in its regulatory activities. 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule includes the following changes to the LRRP program: (1) a 
requirement for dust wipe testing for a subset of renovation activities, and (2) a requirement for dust wipe 
testing and clearance for a subset of renovation activities where the quantity and characteristics of the dust 
make it hard to clean up.  The demand for certified dust sampling technicians is predicted to increase as a 
result of the implementation of the Clearance Rule provision, and therefore more individuals are expected 
to seek dust sampling technician training.  Additionally, a specific set of events already regulated under 
the 2008 LRRP Rule will incur additional per-event dust wipe testing and clearance costs.  
6.1 Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (superseding the PRA of 1980), as implemented by the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requires that agencies submit a supporting statement to OMB 
for any information collection that solicits the same data from more than nine parties.  The PRA seeks to 
ensure that Federal agencies balance their need to collect information with the paperwork burden imposed 
on the public by the collection. 
The definition of “information collection” includes activities required by regulations such as permit 
development, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.  The term “burden” refers to the “time, effort, or 
financial resources” the public expends to provide information to or for a Federal agency, or to otherwise 
fulfill statutory or regulatory requirements.  PRA paperwork burden is measured in terms of annual time 
and financial resources the public devotes to meet one-time and recurring information requirements (44 
U.S.C. 3502(2); 5 C.F.R. 1320.3(b)). 
Information collection activities may include: 
• reviewing rule requirements; 
• using technology to collect, process, and disclose information; 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-2 
• adjusting existing practices to comply with requirements; 
• searching data sources; 
• recordkeeping; 
• completing and reviewing the response; and 
• transmitting or disclosing information. 
Agencies must provide information to OMB on the parties affected, the annual reporting burden, and the 
annualized cost associated with responding to information collection requirements. 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would result in additional paperwork-related burden for the three 
types of entities: 
1. The dust sampling technician would be required to collect dust samples, prepare a dust wipe 
testing report, and provide it to the renovation firm (Section 6.1.1).  (In instances where the 
renovator is also the dust sampling technician, this item and the following one would be 
combined.) 
2. Renovation firms would be required to provide copies of the dust wipe testing report to owners 
and occupants.  
3. Training providers would incur additional paperwork burden related to course accreditation and 
notification (Section 6.1.2). 
6.1.1 Paperwork Burden and Costs for Dust Wipe Testing Report 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would require the certified dust sampling technician to prepare a 
dust wipe testing report and provide it to the renovation firm within three days of the date that the dust 
wipe test results are obtained.  If the dust wipe test results are to be determined by a fixed-site laboratory, 
the samples have to be sent to the laboratory within one business day of the date they are collected.  The 
dust wipe testing or clearance report would include the name and signature of each certified person 
collecting the samples or performing the testing, the name and address of each certified firm employing 
the persons conducting the sampling or testing, the start and completion dates of the renovation, a brief 
written description of the renovation, the results of the visual inspection, a detailed written description of 
the specific sampling or testing locations or a detailed drawing that clearly identifies the location of each 
sample or test, the name of the NLLAP-recognized entity analyzing the results, the results of each sample 
or test, and the clearance standard that is applicable to each sample or test. 
6.1.1.1 Number of Firms Performing Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Events 
As discussed in Section 4.4, there are 223,821 entities performing events requiring dust wipe testing or 
clearance in residential housing during the first year of the rule.  It is estimated that firms working in 
public and commercial building child-occupied facilities will perform one event that requires dust wipe 
testing or clearance per year.  The number of child-occupied facilities using in-house staff to perform 
these types of events is estimated to be 686 in the first year of the rule.  There will be an estimated 448 
events performed by non-residential contractors in year 1.  Table 6-1 presents the total number of firms 
expected to incur paperwork burden and costs due to the proposed rule.

b.  RRP is performed by a contractor in a public or commercial building where a COF is located. 
 
6.1.1.2 Paperwork Burden and Unit Costs 
Two types of costs are estimated in this analysis: 
• Labor costs associated with collecting dust wipe samples, shipping samples to the lab, preparing 
the dust wipe testing or clearance report, and providing reports to owners and occupants of 
structures where dust wipe testing or clearance was performed. 
• Material costs associated with collecting, shipping, and analyzing dust wipe samples, and 
photocopying and mailing the report. 
Labor Costs 
The lead evaluation firm survey of nine establishments described in Chapter 4 asked respondents how 
much labor time would be necessary for taking four dust wipe samples, sending them to the lab, and 
providing a report to the contractor.  The average response was 1.75 hours.  Subtracting the estimated 
marginal labor time for four samples (0.19 hours per sample; see Section 4.3.3) and the assumed labor 
time for shipping results (0.083 hours), the average labor time for writing a short report as described 
above would be 0.9 hours, or 54 minutes.  Thus, EPA estimates that dust sampling technicians will spend 
an average of 0.83 hours during each sampling event collecting samples (based on a typical time of 0.19 
hours per sample), about 0.9 hours preparing the report, and renovators will spend about five minutes 
shipping samples or reports, for an average renovation firm burden of 1.8 hours per event. 
The burden attributed to renovation firms includes the time required to perform the dust sampling, ship 
the samples to the laboratory, and prepare and send a summary report to the necessary parties.  All 
renovation firms are required to provide a copy of the dust wipe testing report to the owner and if 
different, the occupant of the building being renovated or the operator of the child-occupied facility. 
EPA assumes that renovation firms working in residential housing will have certified dust sampling 
technicians on staff to perform the dust sampling and report preparation activities.  Residential contractors 
are estimated to perform an average of 7 renovations per year where dust wipe testing will be required, 
with an average burden of 1.8 hours per event.   
Entities performing work in public and commercial building child-occupied facilities are expected to hire 
third-party lead evaluation firms to perform dust sampling.  Therefore, these entities will only incur a 
labor burden of 5 minutes for shipping the dust sampling report to owners and occupants.  The cost of 
hiring a third-party firm is accounted for as a material cost. 
Material Costs 
In addition to the time needed to collect dust wipe samples, ship them to the lab, and prepare and mail a 
summary report, entities performing RRP events will also incur the costs of the lab analysis, dust wipe 
sample materials, shipping charges, and report materials.  Based on a survey of nine establishments, EPA 
 Chapter 6 6-3 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
estimates a lab cost of $19.00 per sample.  EPA estimates the cost of the dust wipes to be $0.25 per wipe.  
Based on per-page photocopy costs, EPA estimates that a single copy of the dust wipe testing report 
(assumed to average four pages in length, accounting for a one page job description, one page of lab 
results, one page for a diagram of sample locations, and one additional page to account for the instances 
where more than three pages might be necessary, such as a renovation event occurring in multiple rooms) 
costs $0.36.  EPA estimates a shipping cost of $4.95 based on the rate for Priority Mail using the U.S. 
Postal Service.  After events requiring clearance to be achieved, EPA assumes renovation firms will send 
reports via overnight mail; EPA estimates the overnight shipping cost to be $15.68.   
EPA assumes that renovation firms working in residential housing will have certified dust sampling 
technicians on staff to perform the dust sampling and report preparation activities.  Entities performing 
work in public and commercial building child-occupied facilities are expected to hire third-party lead 
evaluation firms to perform dust sampling.  Therefore, these entities will incur labor costs associated with 
sending the dust sampling report to building owners and operators, whereas the cost of hiring a third-party 
firm is accounted for as a material cost.   
Because the written report labor time, shipping labor time, and paper copy and shipping material costs of 
clearance events are all dependent upon the expected number of clearance failures, per-event paperwork 
burden estimates must be calculated separately for each size and type of event, as described in the cost 
analysis in Chapter 4.  Table 6-2 presents the average per-entity burden and the total labor burden on 
firms to comply with the proposed Clearance Rule.  Table 6-3 presents the average labor, material, and 
total per-entity costs.

6.1.1.3 Total Paperwork Costs for RRP Establishments 
The proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would apply to establishments affected by the 2008 LRRP rule and 
to establishments predicted to seek certification as a result of the proposed elimination of the opt-out 
provision.  Under the proposed option, the entire stock of construction firms working in target housing 
necessary to meet demand would incur dust wipe testing and clearance costs starting in the first year.  
Other entities doing RRP in public and commercial building COFs, such as public schools, private 
schools, daycare centers, non-residential property managers and lessors, and non-residential contractors 
would also be affected by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  Given the relative infrequency of dust 
wipe testing and clearance events in public and commercial buildings, entities working in public and 
commercial building COFs are not expected to perform more than one activity requiring dust wipe testing 
or clearance per year.  Therefore, the number of affected entities is estimated as the number of buildings 
with a renovation event requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in the first year. 
Per-establishment paperwork costs and per-establishment paperwork burdens (defined as the total number 
of hours spent complying with paperwork requirements associated with the proposed rule) were estimated 
by dividing the total costs and burden by the number of certified entities expected to be affected by the 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  Table 6-4 through Table 6-6 present these final per-entity values 
separately for residential construction firms, non-residential contractors, and entities performing RRP in 
public and commercial building COFs.

6.1.2 Training Provider Paperwork Burden and Costs 
EPA has also estimated the information collection burden imposed on training providers.  Additional 
training providers are estimated to become accredited as a result of the LRRP Clearance Rule; therefore, 
there will be incremental paperwork burden for accreditation and re-accreditation.  Further, since the 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule implies an increase in dust sampling training course demand, it is 
estimated that training providers would incur an incremental paperwork burden related to course 
notification.  To comply with the 2008 LRRP rule, training providers must keep records on both the 
courses they provide and the students they train.  In addition, they must notify EPA before offering each 
course (to facilitate EPA’s enforcement activities) and after each course (so EPA has a record of the 
individuals who have completed the course). 
 Chapter 6 6-6 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-7 
6.1.2.1 Burden Associated with Course Accreditation 
It is assumed that 168 training providers, the approximate number accredited to provide lead abatement 
training, will be accredited to provide dust sampling technician training.  As described in Section 2.9.1 of 
the Economic Analysis for the Final Rule, 94 percent of firms in the Other Technical and Trade Schools 
industry category are small businesses (EPA 2008).  Therefore, it is assumed that 94 percent of the 168 
training providers, or 158, are small.  It is assumed that Training Providers will spend eight hours1 
familiarizing themselves with the rule and determining the rule’s applicability to their services in the year 
that they receive initial accreditation.  Training providers will spend an additional four hours of 
professional time and two hours of clerical time completing the accreditation statement in the year they 
receive initial accreditation, and every three years thereafter for re-accreditation.  They will spend one 
additional hour of clerical time each year on annual recordkeeping associated with accreditation. 
Table 6-7 presents the estimation of training provider burden for accreditation.  In year 1, it is assumed 
that 168 training providers will seek initial accreditation.  For each year thereafter, one quarter of the 
necessary stock of training providers will seek accreditation.  Based on EPA’s Federal Lead-Based Paint 
Program (FLPP) database, fifty-five percent of that quarter will seek initial accreditation, and the 
remainder will seek re-accreditation.  In addition, the necessary stock of training providers will diminish 
by 0.41 percent, annually, to reflect the estimated housing demolition rate.

The loaded wage rate for training provider clerical staff is $25.56 per hour.  The loaded wage rate for 
professional training staff is $48.67 per hour.  It is assumed that professional staff will familiarize 
themselves with the rule and will prepare the accreditation statement.  Material costs of accreditation 
include one postage stamp ($0.42), one envelope ($0.02), and two copies ($0.18).  Table 6-8 presents the 
total costs associated with training provider course accreditation.

6.1.2.3 Burden Associated with Notification Requirements 
It is assumed that the pre-notification for each class requires an average of 0.15 hours and that each post-
notification requires 1.54 hours.  The post notifications are more time consuming because the training 
provider must send records pertaining to each student who attended the course.  Approximately 12 
percent of courses will also require a re-notification, which is also estimated to take 0.15 hours.  These 
activities add up to an average of 1.7 clerical hours per course.  The number of courses offered per year 
depends on the number of individuals who need to be trained.  As the proposed 2009 LRRP Clearance 
Rule would increase the demand for dust wipe testing and clearance services, 223,821 dust sampling 
technicians are predicted to seek training in the first year and 44,581 in the second year.  It is assumed 
that training providers would offer an extra 53 courses in the first year, or a total of 158 hours, for the 
added dust sampling technician demand.2  It is assumed that each notification requires one photocopy, 
one envelope, and one stamp; thus approximately two of each of these items are required per course.   
Table 6-9 and Table 6-10 present the burden incurred by training providers due to the notification 
requirements.

6.1.2.4 Costs Associated with Notification Requirements 
Clerical staff will prepare and mail notifications and will perform recordkeeping activities. The loaded 
wage rate for training provider clerical staff is $25.56 per hour.  Training provider notification costs also 
include $0.42 per postage stamp and $0.02 per envelope for mailing notifications and $0.09 per one page 
copy of each notification for the firm’s records.  Training providers are also required to take a digital 
photo of each dust sampling technician receiving certification.  The use of a one-time digital camera costs 
$20.58 per 25 photos3 and takes approximately three minutes per photo or 1.25 hours per 25 photos.

6.1.3 Agency Burden and Cost 
There are also government costs to administer the program.  States, Tribes, and Territories are allowed, 
but are under no obligation, to apply for and receive authorization to administer these requirements.  EPA 
will directly administer programs for States, Tribes, and Territories that do not become authorized.  
Because the number of States, Tribes, and Territories that will become authorized is not known, 
administrative costs are estimated assuming that EPA will administer the program everywhere.  To the 
extent that other government entities become authorized, EPA’s administrative costs will be lower.  
States, Tribes, and Territories that choose to implement the rule themselves are expected to incur similar 
costs on a per-unit basis. 
EPA will incur costs to process training provider accreditations and notifications for dust sampling 
technician training.  To reduce the burden on the regulated community, EPA does not require formal 
certification for dust sampling technicians (this cost is implicit in the fee charged to renovation firms).  
However, EPA will incur incremental costs of contractor support and database maintenance as a result of 
the increase in dust sampling technician certification. 
For the purpose of estimating costs, it is assumed that EPA Regions will incur variable processing costs, 
and fixed administrative and enforcement costs.  Regional administrative activities include answering 
phone inquires from the public regarding the LRRP program, following up on the status of applications, 
providing information to other regions, coordinating with headquarters, and performing other customer 
service activities. Enforcement activities include conducting audits of training providers and firms.  In 
addition, it is assumed that EPA Headquarters will incur fixed administrative costs related to coordination 
with regions and maintenance of the central database and registry.  EPA Headquarters will also support 
enforcement activities. 
Accreditation cost estimates are based on responses from a Time-Motion Study conducted in support of 
the 2009 Economic Analysis for the TSCA section 402 Lead-Based Paint Program Accreditation and 
Certification Fee Rule (i.e., the Fee Rule).  In the Time-Motion Study, data were collected from three 
EPA Regions: Region 2, Region 4, and Region 9.  Regions were asked to provide the number of hours 
and personnel required to process applications under the TSCA section 402(a) Lead-Based Paint 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-12 
Activities program (i.e., the Abatement Rule).  While TSCA section 402(a) defines training and 
certification requirements for five different categories of lead abatement professionals, the type of 
administrative activities associated with the TSCA section 402(a) rule are similar to those expected for 
the Renovation, Repair and Painting Rule. See the 2009 Fee Rule for an in-depth explanation of fee 
structure methodology and calculations. 
6.1.3.1 Agency Costs of Accrediting Training Providers 
To estimate cost of processing accreditation applications for the LRRP rule, EPA followed the approach 
used to estimate these costs for the Abatement rule.  To estimate these costs, EPA first considered the 
variable and fixed costs associated with each applicant type.  The variable costs reflect the regional 
processing costs for each application type.  The fixed costs include the regional and headquarters 
administrative and enforcement costs, which apply across all the applications.  EPA divided the total 
regional enforcement and administrative costs and the headquarters costs by the total estimated number of 
applicants over the five year projection period for the 2008 LRRP Rule.  
Table 6-14 presents the Agency cost per training provider developed in the Economic Analysis for the 
Fees Rule.

Estimated Re-Accreditation $398 $400 
Sources:  The Economic Analysis for the TSCA section 402 Lead-Based Paint

As described above, it is estimated that 168 training providers would become accredited in Year 1.  In 
Year 2, 42 training providers are expected to seek accreditation or re-accreditation, and in Year 3, 42 
training providers are expected to be accredited or re-accredited.  As shown in Table 6-15, based on these 
estimates, it will cost EPA less than $0.1 million to process dust sampling technician notifications in Year 
1.  EPA’s costs for notification processing are estimated to approximately $20,500 in Years 2 and 3.

6.1.3.2 Agency Cost of Processing Training Notifications 
EPA will incur the cost of processing notifications submitted by training providers prior to and following 
each course session.  It is assumed that EPA technical staff with a fully loaded hourly wage of $36.914 
will spend an average of two minutes processing each notification. 
It is estimated that there will be 18,876 training notifications in Year 1, 3,894 in Year 2, and 3,871 in 
Year 3.  As shown in Table 6-16 it will cost EPA $23,226 to process training notifications in the first year 
of the rule, $4,792 in Year 2, and $4,763 in Year 3.

6.1.3.3 Agency Costs of Certifying Dust Sampling Technicians 
Under the 2008 LRRP Rule, dust sampling technicians are not required to apply to EPA for formal 
certification.  However, EPA Headquarters will incur administrative costs related to contract support and 
maintenance of the central database and registry.  EPA estimates the contractor support cost to be $5 per 
dust sampling technician notification.  Central database maintenance, which is a fixed cost, is spread 
across all dust sampling technicians. 
To estimate the costs of processing notifications for the LRRP rule, EPA followed the approach used to 
estimate the costs of processing notifications for the Abatement rule.  To estimate these costs EPA 
considered both the variable and fixed costs associated with each applicant type.  The variable costs 
reflect the regional processing costs for each application type.  The fixed costs include the regional and 
headquarters administrative and enforcement costs, which apply across all the applications.  EPA divided 
the total regional enforcement and administrative costs and the headquarters costs by the total estimated 
number of applicants over the five year period that the training is valid.   
Fixed costs for sampling technicians were estimated by dividing the headquarters administrative costs by 
the total number of applicants over the five year period that the training is valid to obtain an estimated 
cost of $65.  As sampling technicians are not required to obtain formal certification, their costs are 
recouped by the fee charged to RRP firms.  See the 2009 Fee Rule for an in-depth explanation of fee 
structure methodology and calculations. Table 6-17 presents the Agency cost per dust sampling technician 
developed in the Economic Analysis for the Fees Rule. 
 
                                                          
4 EPA used the Office of Personnel Management’s General Salary Table 2008-GS to estimate government employee wage rates.  
EPA used the wage for a GS-11, Step 1 employee and loaded the wage using the standard government multiplier of 1.6 to 
cover overhead and fringe benefits.

It is estimated that 223,821 dust sampling technicians would become certified in Year 1.  In Year 2, 
44,581 technicians are expected to seek certification or re-certification, and in Year 3, 44,398 technicians 
are expected to be certified or re-certified.  As shown in Table 6-18, based on these estimates, it will cost 
EPA $1.3 million to process dust sampling technician notifications in Year 1.  EPA’s costs for 
notification processing are estimated to be less than $0.3 million in Years 2 and 3.

6.1.4 Total Paperwork Burden and Costs for RRP Firms and Training Providers 
Table 6-19 presents the estimated total paperwork burden and costs incurred by all RRP firms and 
training providers in each of the first three years of the proposed revisions’ implementation.  The Agency 
estimated that approximately 224,200 entities would be affected by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
annually. EPA estimated the total annualized burden of the information collection activities due to the 
proposed rule at 2.9 million hours.  
For training providers, total notification and accreditation burden was estimated by multiplying the per-
entity burden estimates in Table 6-8 and Table 6-9 by the number of training providers in each year.  For 
entities performing RRP in target housing and public and commercial building COFs, total reporting 
burden was estimated by multiplying the per-establishment burden estimates by the number of 
establishments affected in each year.  For the rule requirements, a total event paperwork burden was first 
estimated by multiplying the number of events discussed in Chapter 4 by the total hours spent per-event 
complying with the paperwork requirements of the proposed Clearance Rule in each year.  Next, the total 
event paperwork burden was divided by the estimated number of certified RRP establishments in year 1 
to produce burden hours per entity.  Finally, the estimate for the burden hours per entity in year 1 was 
multiplied by the total number of entities in years 2 and 3, yielding the total paperwork burden.  A similar 
methodology was used to calculate total paperwork costs.

6.2 Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980, amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996, requires regulators to assess the effects of regulations on small entities 
including businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments.  In some instances, agencies are also 
required to examine regulatory alternatives that may reduce adverse economic effects on significantly 
impacted small entities.  The RFA requires agencies to prepare an initial and final regulatory flexibility 
analysis for each rule unless the Agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities.  The RFA, however, does not specifically define “a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number” of small entities.  Sections 603 and 604 of the RFA require 
that regulatory flexibility analyses identify the types and estimate the numbers of small entities to which 
the rule will apply.  It also requires a description of the rule requirements to which small entities will be 
subject and any regulatory alternatives, including exemptions and deferral, which would lessen the rule’s 
burden on small entities. 
The 2008 LRRP Rule requires that all entities that perform renovation, repair and painting work for 
compensation in target housing or public and commercial buildings with COFs become certified by EPA, 
ensure that their employees are trained as either renovators or workers, and use lead-safe work practices 
when disturbing lead-based paint, other than events that qualify for the minor maintenance exception.  
This analysis considers the incremental impacts of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on small entities in 
the affected construction, real estate, and child-occupied facility industry sectors.  The proposed LRRP 
Clearance Rule requires dust wipe testing or clearance after certain renovation activities where the 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-16 
quantity and characteristics of the dust make sufficient cleaning difficult.  It is predicted that this 
proposed rule would result in additional individuals seeking dust sampling technician training. It also 
would result in additional dust sampling, re-cleaning, lab, and paperwork costs incurred by firms 
frequently performing these types of high-dust-generating renovation activities.   
Therefore, the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule affects many of the same small entities affected by the 
2008 LRRP rule: entities that provide childcare for compensation including private sector firms (e.g. 
daycare centers and family daycare); small governments (particularly school districts) and non-profit 
organizations; small construction-related contracting firms that provide RRP services to residences or 
public or commercial buildings containing COFs; and property managers and lessors who rent target 
housing or lease space to COFs and use their own staff to conduct RRP work in their buildings.    
The impacts on training providers are not analyzed because the rule will result in an increased demand for 
their services. Therefore training providers will incur positive rather than negative impacts.  Although the 
rule may also result in additional costs for training providers (i.e. costs of additional recordkeeping and 
submitting notifications), training providers are expected to recoup these costs via tuition fees.  These 
tuition fees are accounted for in the estimation of training costs that are incurred by the other entities 
subject to the rule. 
6.2.1 Definitions of Small Entity 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act defines a small government as a government of a city, county, town, 
school district or special district with a population of less than 50,000.  A small non-profit organization is 
defined as any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant 
in its field.  The RFA relies on the definition of a “small business” found in the Small Business Act, 
which authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to develop definitions for “small business.”  
For this analysis, EPA uses SBA’s definition of a small business for each industry. 
For many industry sectors, the SBA definition of a small business is based on revenues, where revenue 
standards vary by industry.  In establishing revenue standards, SBA considers a number of economic and 
market characteristics that may allow a firm to exercise dominance in an industry.  These standards 
represent the maximum revenue that a for-profit enterprise may have and still qualify as a small business. 
Table 6-21 lists the eight NAICS codes of the general and specialty contractors this rule will likely 
impact.  Their respective SBA thresholds are also listed.  Table 6-21 also lists two NAICS codes for 
residential real estate industries, two NAICS codes for nonresidential real estate industries, and one 
NAICS code for child day care services that are also likely to be affected by the rule.  Note that this 
analysis excludes the following construction sectors expected to be affected by the 2008 LRRP rule but 
not the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule: (1) siding contractors, (2) other building equipment contractors, 
(3) other building finishing contractors, and (4) glass and glazing contractors.  These contractors do not 
typically perform the types of renovations covered by the proposed rule.

The RFA classifies small entities as small businesses, small non-profit organizations, or small 
governments.  Property managers and lessors, and construction-related contractors, are all assumed to be 
for profit operations.  All daycare providers operating in individual homes (frequently referred to as 
family daycare) are assumed to be for-profit operations.  Daycare centers can be operated by for-profit or 
non-profit organizations.  Kindergartens and pre-kindergartens refer to facilities in either public schools 
(governmental) or in private schools (assumed to be non-profits).  These classifications are summarized in 
the following table.

6.2.2 General Assumptions and Approach 
This analysis measures the potential incremental impacts of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on small 
businesses in terms of annual compliance costs as a percentage of annual revenues, referred to as the cost 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-18 
impact ratio.6  This approach is based on the premise that the cost impact percentage is an appropriate 
measure of an entity’s ability to afford the costs attributable to a regulatory change.  For purposes of 
determining small entity impacts, comparing annual compliance costs to annual revenues provides a 
reasonable indication of the magnitude of the regulatory burden relative to a commonly available and 
objective measure of a company’s business volume.  Where regulatory costs represent a very small 
fraction of a typical establishment’s revenue, the impacts of a regulation are likely to be minimal. 
This analysis considers seven different groups of entities: public school districts, private schools, daycare 
centers, construction contractors (residential and non-residential), and property lessors and managers 
(residential and non-residential).  The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the incremental impacts of the 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on small entities in a typical year.  In order to develop a realistic 
portrayal of the long-term effects of the rule on small entities, annualized costs of the rule, rather than 
first-year costs, are used to measure its impacts.  Furthermore, when presenting the number of businesses 
affected, the analysis presents the annual average number of businesses, rather than first or second year 
estimates of affected businesses.   
The SBA size standards are measured at the firm or parent company level.  Conceptually, the small entity 
analysis would also be conducted at that level.  Due to data limitations, this small entity analysis is 
conducted at the establishment level rather than at the firm or parent company level for most sectors.  
Census information was available primarily at the establishment level, making a firm or parent company 
analysis unfeasible.  The only sectors where firm-level data are used are non-residential managers and 
lessors, and public schools.   Because establishments, and not organizations, are analyzed, an assumption 
is made that none of the small establishments are subsidiaries of larger organizations.  This assumption 
leads to an overestimate of the number of small independent establishments affected by the rule.  
Furthermore, since organization-level revenues of multi-establishment businesses are higher than 
establishment revenues, the use of establishment data may result in higher cost-impact ratios than actually 
exist. 
The cost-impact ratios estimated for the non-residential real estate industries (NAICS 531110, 531311, 
531120, 531312) in this small entity analysis are based on employment and revenue data for employer 
establishments only.  It is assumed that the majority of non-residential property lessors and managers are 
businesses with employees.  Further, the analysis assumes that a self-employed lessor or manager is likely 
to hire a contractor to perform work on his property, particularly in a non-residential building.   
6.2.2.1 Costs Incurred by Small Establishments 
To estimate the costs incurred by the small entities subject to the requirements of the rule, this analysis 
calculates the number of dust sampling technicians trained and number of dust wipe testing or clearance 
events performed by each of the small entities in a typical year.  The renovation events using a heat gun 
for paint removal, removing or replacing window or door frames, removing paint through scraping, or 
removing trim or molding will only require dust wipe testing. Clearance (which includes dust wipe 
testing) is only necessary for events using machines that disturb lead-based paint through high-speed 
operation or events involving demolition or removal of plaster through destructive means. Therefore, the 
following analysis presents incremental costs for these events under the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  
Average Annualized Unit Cost Estimates 
Unit training costs were calculated by annualizing the total 50-year costs of training dust sampling 
technicians performing RRP projects in target housing or public or commercial building COFs, then 
                                                          
6 For private schools, where adequate revenue data were not available, costs are compared to annual expenditures.   
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
dividing this total by the average annual number of dust sampling technicians trained by these 
establishments. Similarly, the annualized total costs of complying with dust wipe testing and clearance 
provisions were divided by the average annual number of events.  This single set of average annualized 
unit costs was used to calculate total costs to small entities working in target housing and public and 
commercial building COFs.  The use of annual numbers of firms, individuals, and events in calculating 
average annualized costs takes into account the fact that the pre-1978 housing and building stock is 
expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to demolition of a portion of the building stock.   
The numbers of events, individuals, and firms were averaged over the 50 years covered in this analysis 
using the following formula: 
 
50
[A1+(A2*(1-rn))/(1-r)]    Annual Average =  
  Where: 
  A1 = First year number of events, individuals or firms 
  A2 = Second year number of events, individuals or firms  
  r = (1 – 0.41% demolition rate), or 0.9959 
  n = 50 years covered by the analysis 
 
Table 6-23 presents these calculations and the resulting average annualized unit costs.  Because the 
different types of COF operators generally perform renovations with very different job sizes, per-event 
unit costs were calculated separately for each group doing RRP in public and commercial building COFs.

6.2.3 Residential Contractors 
Establishments that perform RRP work in target housing will incur the costs of training, as well as the 
per-event costs of dust wipe testing or clearance following certain renovation activities.  In order to 
distribute the total costs of the rule between small and large establishments, EPA assumed that the 
compliance cost incurred by each establishment is a function of the number of regulated renovation 
 Chapter 6 6-19 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-20 
events that the establishment performs in a typical year.  For each of the eight residential contractor 
NAICS groups, EPA calculated the average annualized numbers of trained dust sampling technicians for 
small entities and the number of proposed LRRP Clearance Rule events being performed by small 
entities.  These averages were calculated separately for non-employer and employer firms.  Using the 
average annualized unit costs, EPA calculated the average annualized total costs to small entities affected 
by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  The use of annualized costs provides a more accurate 
representation of the long-term (typical year) impacts of the rule than would be provided by first or 
second year costs. 
The following six steps were used to calculate the cost-impact ratios for the residential contractor 
industries.  To estimate the impacts of the proposed rule on small entities in the affected industries, the 
following calculations were performed for each NAICS industry: 
Step 1: Certified establishments were classified as either small or large businesses depending on their 
revenues.  Non-employer contractors were considered separately from small employer establishments and 
therefore there are two small business categories for each residential contractor NAICS group. 
Step 2: Census data were used to characterize a “typical” small establishment (in terms of revenues and 
number of employees) in each of the affected industry sectors. 
Step 3: The average number of regulated events performed by an establishment each year was estimated 
by multiplying the ratio of regulated events to personnel by the establishment employment size. 
Step 4: An average cost per event, and the training cost per dust sampling technician were calculated 
using the total annualized 50-year costs to entities working in target housing, the 50-year average number 
of renovation events requiring dust wipe testing or clearance, and the 50-year average number of dust 
sampling technicians obtaining training.   
Step 5: For small entities performing regulated activities, total establishment compliance costs were 
calculated by multiplying the number of events performed and the number of technicians trained by the 
corresponding average annualized costs.   
Step 6: Cost-impact ratios were calculated for a typical small establishment in each industry sector by 
dividing the average compliance costs incurred by each establishment (Step 5) by the establishment’s 
revenues (Step 2).  These cost impact ratios were calculated both for non-employer and small employer 
NAICS groups separately and combined. 
6.2.3.1 Number of Small Residential Contractors and Real Estate Entities Affected by the 
Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
The data used in this analysis were drawn primarily from the 2002 U.S. Economic Census.  As discussed 
in Chapter 2, Census data were used to estimate the number of non-employer establishments (self-
employed contractors) in the affected construction industries.  The 2002 Census also provides data on the 
number, revenue and employment of establishments with payroll by revenue bracket for each construction 
industry sector affected by the rule.  In Chapter 2, these data were used to classify construction 
establishments into two main size classes – establishments with annual revenues of less than $10 million, 
and establishments with annual revenues of $10 million or more.  The percent of establishments, 
employees, net value of construction and total value of business contributed by establishments in each 
revenue bracket can be found in Chapter 2. 
Because 2002 Census data on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not available at the 
time the estimates were developed, 1997 Census data was used to estimate the percent of establishments 
in each industry that qualify for small business status.  These percentages, as well as the percent of 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
industry revenues and employment contributed by small and large establishments, are presented in 
Chapter 2. 
The Small Business Administration revenue thresholds for establishments in the construction sectors are 
currently set at $33.5 million for Residential Remodelers and at $14 million for the seven specialty 
contractor industries.  However, in applying the U.S. Economic Census data to the SBA definition of 
small business, it is not possible to estimate the exact number of construction establishments that have 
revenues below the SBA threshold because the U.S. Economic Census groups all establishments with 
revenues of $10 million or more into one revenue bracket.  Applying the U.S. Economic Census data 
therefore requires either under or overestimating the number of small businesses affected by the rule.  On 
the one hand, using data for the entire industry would overestimate the number of small businesses 
affected by the rule.  It would also underestimate the rule’s impact on small businesses because the 
impacts would be calculated using the revenues of large businesses in addition to small businesses.  On 
the other hand, applying the closest, albeit lower, revenue bracket would underestimate the number of 
small businesses affected by the rule while at the same time overestimating the impacts.  For example, 
because the $10 million cut-off is below the SBA threshold for the Residential Remodeler industry, using 
the U.S. Economic Census data may lead to an underestimate of the number of small businesses in this 
sector, although likely a small underestimate.7  At the same time, using these data may lead to a slight 
overestimate of the impacts of the rule, as the average revenues of small businesses will appear smaller 
when larger establishments (those with revenues of $10 to $33.5 million) are left out.  See Section 6.2.2 
for a discussion of assumptions that may result in an overestimation of the number of affected small 
businesses.  Moreover, using data on all businesses regardless of size would defeat the purpose of 
estimating impacts on small business.  EPA has chosen to be more conservative in estimating the cost 
impacts of the rule on small businesses by using the $10 million threshold for construction industry 
sectors.   
In order to estimate the number of certified small establishments with paid employees, EPA assumed that 
the number of certified small employers is proportional to the total number of small employer 
establishments in the industry.  The total number of certified establishments in each industry (calculated 
in Chapter 4) was multiplied by the percentage of establishments in that industry with revenues below the 
revenue thresholds described above.  For the eight residential construction industry sectors, the resulting 
number of small employer establishments was added to the total number of certified self-employed 
contractors to obtain the total number of small certified establishments.   
Table 6-24 shows the 50-year average number of small businesses affected by the proposed rule.  The 
number of affected businesses is predicted to decrease proportionally to the number of regulated events, 
which in turn decline at an annual rate of 0.41 percent (see Chapter 4 for discussion).

7 Because 99.7 percent of Residential Remodeler establishments earn less than $10 million per year, any 
underestimate of the number of establishments is likely to be minimal.

6.2.3.2 Training Costs – Small Residential Contractors  
Number of Individuals Trained – Residential Contractors 
As described above, the number of certified small establishments with paid employees was estimated 
assuming that the number of certified small employers is proportional to the total number of small 
employer establishments in the industry.  The total number of certified establishments in each industry 
(calculated in Chapter 4) was multiplied by the percentage of establishments in that industry with 
revenues below the revenue thresholds described above in section 6.2.3.  The number of small employer 
establishments in each NAICS group expected to obtain certification is presented in Table 6-25.  Each of 
these establishments is assumed to seek dust sampling technician training for one employee.  
To estimate the number of employees of an average small establishment in each affected industry, EPA 
used U.S. Economic Census data to determine the portion of each industry’s employees that work for 
small businesses.  This percentage was applied to the estimated number of trained dust sampling 
technicians and workers in each sector to calculate the number of trained dust sampling technicians and 
workers employed by small certified establishments.  For each of the construction and real estate industry 
sectors, the total number of employees (including non-employers) was divided by the total number of 
small establishments to calculate an average small business employment size. 
Table 6-25 presents the 50-year average number of small certified employer firms, each of which is 
assumed to employ one trained dust sampling technician.  Only entities that would use their own dust 
sampling technician for compliance with the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule would incur additional 
training costs. As described in Chapter 4, it was found to be cost-effective for all residential non-employer 
and employer construction firms to train their own dust sampling technician rather than use third party 
dust wipe testing services. It was also shown that none of these establishments are expected to perform 
enough dust wipe testing or clearance events annually to justify training more than one dust sampling 
technician.

To estimate small residential contractor training costs, the numbers of individuals in Table 6-25 and Table 
6-26 were multiplied by the average annualized costs of training a single certified dust sampling 
technician from Table 6-23.  The resulting average annualized training costs are presented in Table 6-27.

6.2.3.3 Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Costs – Small Residential Contractors  
Number of Events Performed Annually by Small Residential Contractors 
As discussed in Section 6.2.2 and the beginning of this section, this analysis attributes the dust wipe 
testing and clearance costs of the proposed rule to establishments on a per-event basis.  In order to 
estimate the total number of events performed by establishments in each of the affected industries and in 
order to distribute these events between small and large establishments, EPA assumed that the number of 
events performed by each establishment is proportional to the number of people the establishment 
employs.  Furthermore, EPA assumed that the number of events performed by each trained employee will 
be the same across all industries.  If a certain industry performs fewer events than estimated here, the 
impacts on these establishments will be slightly smaller and the impacts on the other construction 
industries will be slightly larger.   
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
The number of events per small establishment in a particular industry was calculated as follows: 
 
 Chapter 6 6-25 
 
EPA estimated the 50-year average number of events per employee by calculating the ratio of the total 
number of regulated events to the total number of construction workers (using the 50-year averages).  
Because the number of establishments, as estimated in Chapter 4, was assumed to be proportional to the 
regulated housing stock and the number of regulated events, the number of RRP events per employee 
does not change over time.  
To estimate the average number of events performed by a small establishment in a given industry, the 
establishment’s average employment size was multiplied by the average number of events per individual.   
Table 6-28 presents the 50-year average estimated number of events per small establishment.

Table 6-23 presents the annualized average per-event costs of the proposed rule.  For affected entities, 
these costs include the cost of performing dust wipe testing following certain renovation activities and 
complying with the re-cleaning and clearance requirements for another set of renovation practices. 
Multiplying the average event cost per small establishment by the total 50-year average number of small 
entities (see Section 6.2.3.1) yields the total incremental dust wipe testing and clearance costs of the 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  These costs are presented in Table 6-29.

6.2.3.4 Residential Contractors  
Cost-impact ratio analysis compares the cost of a regulation to an establishment’s total revenues, not just 
to its revenues from the regulated activity.  As such, for construction establishments, the costs of the rule 
were compared to the total value of business done rather than just to the total value of construction work.  
For real estate establishments, total revenues were used.   Because no revenue data are available 
Number of Events = (Events/Employee) X (Average Establishment Employment Size) 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-26 
specifically for establishments expected to seek certification under the regulations, EPA assumed that 
average revenues of these businesses do not differ significantly from industry averages. 
EPA calculated the revenues of a small certified construction business as a weighted average of small 
employer and non-employer revenues.  The 2002 U.S. Economic Census presents data on the number and 
total value of business done by construction establishments with total annual revenues of $0 to $10 
million and $10 million or more.  To estimate the average revenues of small employers in each of the 
affected construction sectors, the total value of business done by establishments in the $0 to $10 million 
bracket was divided by the total number of establishments in that bracket.  Since the Census presents 
revenue figures in year 2002 dollars, the resulting average revenues were inflated to 2008 dollars using 
the Consumer Price Index.8  Per-establishment revenues for non-employers were estimated for the cost 
impact ratio analysis by dividing non-employer revenues (inflated to 2008 dollars) by the number of non-
employer establishments in each industry.  Average revenues of certified small establishments are 
presented in Table 6-30.  Because 2002 data on the number of establishments by revenue bracket was not 
available at the time the estimates were developed, 1997 data was used to estimate the percent of 
establishments in each industry that qualify for small business status.  EPA also used 1997 Census data to 
calculate the percent of industry revenues contributed by these establishments.  These percentages were 
then applied to the 2002 numbers of establishments and industry revenue figures to estimate the number 
and revenues of small and large employers in each industry.  Average small employer revenues 
(calculated by dividing the revenues of establishments in each industry and revenue bracket by the 
corresponding number of establishments) were inflated to 2008 dollars using the Consumer Price Index. 
The resulting estimates are presented in Table 6-30.

establishments were estimated by first taking the sum of the total annualized event and training costs 
incurred by these entities and dividing these total costs by the number of establishments.  Average costs 
per establishment were then divided by average revenues to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio.  These 
calculations, and the resulting cost-to-revenue ratios, are presented in Table 6-31.

Table 6-32 presents the impacts of the rule on small residential contractors, by NAICS group, for non-
employer and employer establishments both separately and combined.  Impact estimates for non-
employers should be interpreted with caution, as some non-employers may have issues related to under-
reporting of income, which would tend to exaggerate the average impact ratio for this class of small 
entities.  According to GAO, many sole proprietors underreport their income, with a small proportion 
accounting for the bulk of understatements (GAO 1994 and 2007).  According to IRS estimates reported 
by GAO, sole proprietors underreported their net income by 57 percent in 2001 (GAO 2007).  The IRS 
estimates address net income (i.e., revenues minus expenses), while the small entity analysis compares 
compliance costs to revenues.  According to IRS figures, underreporting of gross income makes up at 
least half of the misreporting of net income.  A key reason for this underreporting is that the income of the 
self-employed is not subject to withholding and only a portion of that income is subject to information 
reporting by third parties (GAO 2007).  The IRS estimates that at least 61 percent of sole proprietors 
underreported their income, and the IRS recognizes that these are underestimates because detecting 
underreported income is difficult, especially cash receipts (GAO 2007).  Although at least 61 percent of 
sole proprietors had understated taxes, the amounts were skewed with half of sole proprietors understating 
less than $903.

6.2.4 Non-Residential Contractors 
Non-residential contractors (i.e., those working in public or commercial building COFs) are currently 
regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule.  Jobs that are not performed in-house by public and private schools, 
non-residential property managers/lessors, or daycare centers will be performed by general and specialty 
contractors including painters, electricians, plumbers/HVAC specialists, and non-residential building 
contractors.  Under the proposed rule, 448 establishments are expected to incur dust wipe testing and 
clearance costs in the first year.  Because different contractors are generally expected to work in public or 
commercial buildings and target housing, this analysis considers impacts on these groups of 
establishments separately. 
Because renovation events in public or commercial building COFs are generally larger compared to those 
in target housing, this analysis assumes that only contractors with employees will work on COFs in public 
 Chapter 6 6-28 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-29 
or commercial buildings.9  Furthermore, the types of jobs performed in public or commercial building 
COFs are generally less varied than those in target housing.  Events in COFs are assumed to consist 
primarily of painting, window/door replacement, and plumbing and electrical projects.  As such, it is 
likely that most of these projects will be performed by painting, plumbing/HVAC, electrical, and 
commercial building contractors (NAICS 238320, 238220, 238210 and 236220, respectively).  As 
illustrated in Chapter 4, non-residential contractors will not typically perform enough dust wipe testing or 
clearance events annually to make it cost-effective for them to train their own dust sampling technician.  
While non-residential contractors are not expected to incur training costs, they are assumed to incur third 
party dust wipe testing and clearance costs for the events in public and commercial buildings that they 
perform.   
6.2.4.1 Number of Small Non-Residential Contractors Affected by the Proposed LRRP Clearance 
Rule 
To estimate the number of construction establishments working in public or commercial building COFs, 
the number of affected jobs they perform, and their average revenues, the following assumptions were 
made: 
¾ The number of contractors in each sector is proportional to the number of jobs likely to be 
performed by each type of contractor.   
¾ These currently regulated contractors are only assumed to perform projects in public or 
commercial building COFs.  In reality, however, these additional contractors may perform some 
residential work and some commercial work, while contractors with employees that were 
included in the residential contractor section of this analysis may also do some of the non-
residential COF work.  As such, to define the size and revenue of the average small firm working 
in public or commercial building COFs, the numbers of certified non-residential contractors with 
employees were added to the pool of pre-existing certified residential employer establishments in 
the corresponding sectors.  The percent of small establishments in each sector, percent of workers 
employed (and thus jobs performed) by these establishments, and percent of total value of 
business earned by these establishments were calculated using 2002 Economic Census data on the 
number of small establishments and employees working for small establishments (U.S. Census 
Bureau 2005a).  Average revenues of small establishments were estimated by dividing the total 
value of business earned by establishments with revenues below $10 million in each sector by the 
total number of establishments with revenues below $10 million in that sector.  The results of 
these calculations are presented for in Table 6-34.  Note that because only establishments with 
employees are assumed to work in public or commercial building COFs, average revenues of 
small establishments in Table 6-34 are higher than the average revenues of residential 
construction establishments, which include self-employed contractors. 
Table 6-33 presents the distribution of events by COF type, shows the ratio of contractor to in-house 
events, and presents estimates of the total number of contractor events in the first year.  Table 6-34 
displays the estimated number and characteristics of small non-residential contractor firms affected by the 
2008 LRRP Rule.  Although 3,223 non-residential property manager and lessor firms are regulated under 
the 2008 LRRP Rule, only a fraction of these firms will perform renovation in public and commercial 
building COFs requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in a given year.  It is estimated that an average of 
448 non-residential contractors will be affected by the proposed rule in an average year.  
                                                          
9  In contrast, the analysis of target housing contractors assumes that both employer and non-employer (i.e., self-
employed) contractors will work on COFs in target housing.

This analysis assumes that private schools, public schools, and non-profit daycare centers which use in-house 
staff to perform RRP will perform all window/door carpentry work every year in-house.  Non-residential 
contractor firms will perform all other RRP.  Non-residential contractor firms will perform all RRP events in 
owner-occupied daycare centers, daycare centers that do not perform some of their own RRP, and small private 
schools.

6.2.4.2 Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Costs – Non-Residential Contractors 
Number of Events Performed by Small Establishments – Non-Residential Contractors 
On average, 69 percent of the 448 non-residential contractor dust wipe testing or clearance events in the 
first year are performed by small businesses.  Since the number of affected firms is defined to be the 
number of firms performing a dust wipe testing or clearance event in the first year, the number of jobs 
performed is equivalent to the number of establishments affected.  Table 6-35 presents the total number of 
small contractor establishments incurring event costs and the number of events in the first year.

To estimate typical annual small businesses impacts, this analysis estimated the 50-year average number

Total Clearance Rule Costs – Non-Residential Contractors 
To estimate total event costs incurred by small non-residential construction establishments working in 
public or commercial building COFs, the 50-Year average annual number of events performed by these 
establishments (1 per firm) was multiplied by the average annualized per-event cost ($603; see Table 6-
23).  Table 6-37 presents the resulting annualized total and average costs of the Clearance Rule to small 
non-residential construction establishments.

6.2.4.3 Impacts of the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on Non-Residential Contractors 
Impacts of the rule on small non-residential contractors are measured by comparing the costs of the rule 
incurred by an establishment to the establishment’s revenues.  The impacts on small non-residential 
contractors were estimated by first dividing the total dust wipe testing and clearance costs under the 
proposed option by the number of establishments.  Average costs per establishment were then divided by 
average revenues to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio.  These calculations, and the resulting cost-to-
revenue ratios, are presented in Table 6-38.

6.2.5 Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers 
Non-residential property lessors and managers are currently regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule. 
Lessors and managers of pre-1978 public or commercial buildings that rent space to daycare centers and 
perform regulated projects on their own properties will incur dust wipe testing and clearance costs under 
the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule.  The analysis in Chapter 4 demonstrated that non-residential property 
managers and lessors are not expected to typically perform enough dust wipe testing or clearance events 
annually to justify obtaining dust sampling technician training for one of their employees.  Instead, non-
residential real estate firms are assumed to incur only third party dust wipe testing costs for the dust wipe 
testing events (and third party and re-cleaning costs for the clearance events) in public and commercial 
buildings that they perform.  As discussed in Chapter 4, this analysis estimates that 13,279 daycare 
centers will rent space in pre-1978 non-residential buildings in the first year.  On average (over 50 years), 
12,028 daycare centers are expected to rent space in pre-1978 buildings each year.  Because daycare 
centers are only one of many types of establishments renting non-residential space and because the LRRP 
Rule applies only to centers in buildings constructed prior to 1978, the analysis also assumes that each 
property manager or lessor firm owns only one non-residential building containing a COF.  As such, the 
number of affected lessor/manager firms is equivalent to the number of affected daycare centers renting 
space or 12,028 firms.  Due to the lack of data on the extent to which these firms perform renovation 
work in their own buildings, this analysis assumes that they will behave similarly to the operators of other 
public or commercial buildings with child-occupied facilities, namely that they will perform all of their 
own painting and window/door carpentry projects. 
6.2.5.1 Number of Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers Affected by the Proposed 
LRRP Clearance Rule 
Although 12,028 non-residential property manager and lessor firms are regulated under the 2008 LRRP 
Rule, only a fraction of these firms are operators of daycare center buildings which will undergo 
renovation requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in a given year.  It is estimated that an average of 152 
daycare center buildings renting space will be affected by the proposed rule in an average year.  
Lessors and managers of non-residential properties fall under NAICS 531120 and 531312, respectively.  
In order to estimate the number of regulated firms in each of these sectors, it is assumed that the percent 
of regulated firms in each industry is equivalent to the total percent of non-residential real estate firms in 
 Chapter 6 6-32 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
that industry.  In other words, since Lessors of Non-Residential Buildings (NAICS 531120) make up 73 
percent of establishments in NACIS 531120 and 531312 combined, 73 percent of the 12,028 
lessor/manager firms affected by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule are also assumed to fall in this 
sector, while the remaining 27 percent are assumed to fall under NAICS 531312 (Calculated based on 
U.S. Census Bureau 2005f). 
As discussed in Section 2.4.2 of Chapter 2, 96 percent of Lessors of Non-Residential Real Estate, and 81 
percent of Non-Residential Property Managers qualify for small business status under the SBA definition 
of a small business in these sectors (U.S. Census Bureau 2005f).  This analysis assumes that the size 
distribution of regulated firms mirrors the size distribution of the entire non-residential property lessor 
and manager industry.  Table 6-39 presents the resulting estimates of the number of small non-residential 
property lessors and managers affected by the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule in a typical year.

6.2.5.2 Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Costs – Non-Residential Property Lessors and Managers 
Given the relative infrequency of dust wipe testing and clearance events, each affected property lessor or 
manager is assumed to perform no more than one event per year.  Thus, the estimation of costs incurred 
by each regulated property lessor or manager establishment is based on the average dust wipe 
testing/clearance costs per event.   
The total number of regulated events was multiplied by the average annualized per-event costs (see Table 
6-23) to calculate these firms’ total annualized event costs.  Table 6-40 presents these estimates, as well 
as the average rule costs per small firm.

6.2.5.3 Impacts of the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on Non-Residential Property Lessors and 
Managers 
This small entity analysis measures the incremental impacts of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on 
small non-residential property lessors and managers by comparing rule costs incurred by these firms to 
the weighted average revenue of small firms in NAICS 531120 and 531312, calculated based on 2002 
Census Data.  The weighted average revenue figure of $111,460 was inflated to 2008 dollars using the 
Consumer Price Index to obtain estimated revenues of $139,118.  The impacts on small non-residential 
property lessors and managers were estimated by first dividing total event costs incurred by these entities 
by the number of establishments.  Average costs per establishment were then divided by average revenues 
to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio.   
The average annual numbers of businesses affected, average annualized per-business costs and revenues, 
and the resulting cost-to-revenue ratio are presented in Table 6-41.

6.2.6 Daycare Centers (Small Non-Profits) 
6.2.6.1 Number of Small, Non-Profit Daycare Centers Affected by the Proposed LRRP Clearance 
Rule 
As discussed in Chapter 2, there are an estimated 87,840 daycare centers in the United States.  These 
daycare centers include facilities that provide day care outside of a residential home and outside of 
schools.  Assuming a 75 percent compliance rate, and adjusting the total number of centers for building 
age using HUD data on the age of education buildings, an estimated 38,210 daycare centers would be 
affected by the proposed rule in the first year.10  As discussed in Chapter 4, because of their locations, 
for-profit daycare centers are expected to hire outside contractors to perform their renovations and repairs 
or to have their landlord handle these activities.  The costs and impacts for these events are accounted for 
in the sections of this chapter addressing contractors and landlords. 
                                                          
Daycare centers located in religious establishments such as churches or synagogues, however, frequently 
use their own staff to perform some of their RRP events.  According to the HUD survey of child care 
centers (HUD 2003), approximately 73 percent of daycare centers located in churches and other religious 
establishments use their own (or the religious organization’s) staff to perform painting projects.  This 
analysis assumes that, similar to public school districts and private schools, these establishments will also 
use their own staff to perform all window/door carpentry work. 
The number of non-profit daycare centers is estimated as the number of daycare centers located in 
religious establishments, which are identified in the data from the HUD survey of child care centers 
(HUD 2003).  According to these data, 41 percent of all daycare centers are situated in churches or other 
buildings owned by religious establishments (the US Census reports that about 35 percent of daycare 
10 Based on 2003 HUD data, 58 percent of all education buildings were constructed before 1978, and 55 percent of 
the pre-1978 buildings were constructed before 1960. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
centers located outside of schools are non-profits (U.S. Census Bureau 2005c)).  The other 59 percent of 
daycare centers are assumed to use outside contractors for their RRP work rather than in-house staff.  
Because the estimate of centers that are in religious settings is relatively large and there is no independent 
data on other non-profits, this analysis estimates that about 30 percent of daycare centers 
(0.73*0.41=.299) will perform their own renovation work and thus incur direct work practice and training 
costs.11  Because all of these establishments are treated as though they are operated by religious 
organizations, all daycare centers considered in the small entity analysis are considered to be non-profit 
organizations.  As the RFA defines independently owned and operated not-for-profit enterprises that are 
not dominant in their field as “small organizations,” all the non-profit organizations operating these 
daycare centers are assumed to qualify as small entities.  This assumption may overestimate the number 
of impacted small non-profits, since some of these non-profit organizations may not be small entities. 
 Table 6-42 presents the number of daycare centers performing regulated activities in a typical year, the 
total number of daycare centers operated by non-profit organizations (based on the number in religious 
organizations), and the number expected to perform some renovation work in-house.  The estimation of 
the annual average numbers of centers accounts for the fact that, after the first year, the number of 
regulated daycare centers is expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to building demolition.

Although 10,481 non-profit daycare centers are regulated structures under the 2008 LRRP Rule, only a 
fraction of these buildings will undergo renovation requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in a typical 
year.  It is estimated that an average of 132 non-profit daycare center buildings doing RRP work in-house 
will be affected by the proposed rule in a typical year.  
6.2.6.2 Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Costs – Non-Profit Daycare Centers 
The estimated dust wipe testing and clearance costs incurred by each daycare center are based on the 
average per-event cost of renovation events requiring dust wipe testing or clearance.  The analysis in 
Chapter 4 demonstrated that daycare centers are not expected to typically perform enough dust wipe 
testing or clearance events annually to justify obtaining dust sampling technician training for one of their 
employees.  Instead, daycare centers are assumed to incur only third party dust wipe testing and clearance 
costs for the events that they perform.   
Total Clearance Rule Costs – Non-Profit Daycare Centers 
Staff in non-profit daycare centers (such as those operated by religious establishments) are expected to 
perform in-house all painting and window/door carpentry work in their building.  Each affected firm is 
assumed to perform one event per year. 
                                                          
11  Given the small size of the HUD survey sample, and the difference between the HUD and Census figures, the 
estimate may include some non-profits operating daycare facilities that are not in religious settings but perform 
their own repair work.  Other non-profit daycare facilities may be hiring outside contractors, the same as for-
profit daycare facilities are assumed to do. 
 Chapter 6 6-35 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
As discussed in Section 6.2.2, the average annualized cost per event in daycare center buildings is $490 
(see Table 6-23).  Multiplying this average cost by the total 50-year average annual number of events in 
daycare centers that perform their own work yields the total annualized event costs incurred by these 
centers in an average year.  Since centers are assumed to perform no more than one event per year, the 
annual number of events is equal to the number of centers performing dust wipe testing or clearance in an 
average year.  These average total and per-center costs are presented in Table 6-43.

6.2.6.3 Non-Profit Daycare Center Expenditures 
In analyzing impacts of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on an entity, the analysis conceptually should 
compare rule costs to the revenues or expenditures of an entire organization.  As such, costs of the rule to 
non-profit daycare centers should be compared to the revenues or expenditures of the parent organization 
(such as the religious organization that operates them), rather than a single center.  Due to a lack of data 
both on the structure of these organizations and on their finances, such a comparison was not possible.  
Instead, this analysis is based on daycare center revenues. Ten state childcare industry impact studies 
were reviewed to obtain daycare center revenue data.12  Nine of these studies did not differentiate 
between revenues of non-profit and for-profit centers.  The Virginia Economic Impact of the Child Care 
Industry report (Voices of Virginia’s Children 2004), however, provided revenue data specific to 
religiously affiliated daycare centers.  The state reported annual total revenues of $236 million for its 929
religious daycare facilities or average revenues (inflated to 2008$) of $317,062 (U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics 2006).  This figure was used to measure the incremental impacts of the proposed LRRP 
Clearance Rule on non
 
-profit centers. 
                                                          
6.2.6.4 Impacts on Non-Profit Daycare Centers 
The impacts on non-profit daycare centers were estimated by first dividing total annualized costs incurred 
by these entities by the number of centers.  Average costs per center were then divided by average 
revenues to calculate a cost-to-revenue ratio.  These calculations and the resulting ratios are presented in 
Table 6-44.

6.2.7 Public Schools (Small Governments) 
The RFA defines a small government jurisdiction as the government of a city, county, town, school 
district or special district with a population of less than 50,000.  This economic analysis relies on National 
Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core of Data (CCD) survey data to estimate the number 
of school districts that have schools with pre-kindergarten or kindergarten programs, the number of such 
schools per district, and district revenues.13  Furthermore, for most districts, a cross-reference system with 
the 2000 Decennial Census provides a means for estimating the size of the population served by the 
district.   
6.2.7.1 Number of Small Public School Districts Affected by the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
Number of Small Public School Districts 
As discussed in Chapter 2, there are approximately 18,000 public school districts in the United States.  
Based on CCD data, 14,473 of these school districts have at least one school with a kindergarten or pre-K 
program; in total, these districts have 52,129 such schools (NCES 2006b,c).  Of the 14,473 school 
districts, 13,330 serve a population of fewer than 50,000 people.  These 13,330 districts have a total of 
26,779 schools with kindergartens or pre-kindergartens (NCES 2006b,c,g).  These counts are not limited 
to pre-1978 schools. 
Since the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is only concerned with the direct costs of regulation, this small 
entity analysis only considers the costs that school districts will incur if they perform regulated 
renovation, repair, or painting projects using their own maintenance staff instead of hiring a contractor.  
Costs and impacts associated with work performed by a contractor are accounted for in the contractor 
section of this analysis.  
As discussed in Chapter 4, this analysis assumes that public schools will perform all painting and 
carpentry events using in-house staff.14  Thus, small school districts that have at least one pre-1978 
building may incur costs under the proposed rule.   
Number of Small Public Schools Affected by the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule 
The number of small school districts with at least one building regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule was 
estimated based on the number of school buildings in the district and the likelihood that any one of the 
buildings is old enough to be regulated.  Using 2003 HUD data, 58 percent of school buildings are 
estimated to have been built before 1978, and 55 percent of the pre-1978 buildings are estimated to have 
built before 1960 (U.S. HUD 2003).  Thus, for example, the probability that any particular school 
building was built after 1978 is 0.42 (1-0.58).  The likelihood that a district has no pre-1978 buildings is a 
function of the number of buildings and 0.42 as follows15: 
 (0.42)^X, where X is the number of schools with kindergarten or pre-kindergarten in the district 
                                                          
13 It is possible that government agencies also operate some of the childcare facilities included in the daycare center 
counts throughout this economic analysis.  Due to insufficient data, it was not possible to estimate the number 
of such government-run facilities, or the number or size of the agencies that operate them.  As such, this small 
government impact analysis is limited to public school districts. 
14 The analysis assumes that all electrical, plumbing and HVAC work are contracted out. 
15 It is assumed that the age of each building is independent of the age of all other buildings in the district.  This may 
somewhat overestimate the number of districts that have at least one pre-1978 buildings.  But data are not 
available to calculate the joint probabilities. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
For example, a district with three buildings has a (0.42)*(0.42)*(0.42) = 0.074 probability of containing 
no pre-1978 buildings.  Using this approach, 92.6 percent of districts with three buildings are estimated to 
have at least one building that is pre-1978.  To estimate the average number of pre-1978 buildings in a 3-
building district with at least one pre-1978 building, the total number of buildings in 3-building districts 
was multiplied by the percent of all schools constructed before 1978 (58 percent) and divided by the 
number of districts with at least one pre-1978 building.   
 Table 6-45 presents the 50-year average numbers of small school districts with at least one pre-1978 
building and the average number of buildings in these districts.  The use of 50-year average, rather than 
first or second year numbers accounts for the fact that, after the first year, the numbers of regulated 
districts and pre-1978 schools are expected to decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to building 
demolition.

a.   A regulated building is defined as having a kindergarten or pre-kindergarten program. 
 
Although 10,552 buildings in small public school districts are regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule, only 
a fraction of these buildings will undergo renovation requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in a typical 
year.  It is estimated that an average of 257 public school buildings (large and small) will be affected by 
the proposed rule in a typical year. Based on the number of buildings in small districts relative to the total 
number of public school buildings, 132 public school buildings in small districts are expected to be 
affected by the rule in a typical year.  Given the relative infrequency of dust wipe testing and clearance 
events, each affected small public school district is assumed to perform no more than one event per year.  
Thus, 132 public school districts are expected to be affected by the rule in a typical year. 
6.2.7.2 Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Costs – Public Schools 
Since each affected public school district is assumed to perform one event per year, the estimation of 
costs incurred by each affected district is based on the average costs per event.  The analysis in Chapter 4 
demonstrated that public schools are not expected to typically perform enough dust wipe testing or 
clearance events annually to justify obtaining dust sampling technician training for one of their 
employees.  Instead, public schools are assumed to incur only third party dust wipe testing and clearance 
costs for the events that they perform.   
Total Clearance Rule Costs – Public Schools 
As discussed in 6.2.2, the average annualized cost per event in public schools is $766 (see Table 6-23).  
Multiplying this average cost by the average annual number of events in small school districts yields the 
total annualized event costs incurred by small districts in a typical year.  These costs, and resulting 
average costs per district, are presented in Table 6-46.

6.2.7.3 Public School Revenues 
The impact of the proposed rule on small government jurisdictions is estimated by comparing the 
estimated incremental costs of the proposed rule to the annual government revenues of small regulated 
jurisdictions.  Revenue data for school districts is available from NCES’s Common Core of Data “Local 
Education Agency (School District) Finance Survey (F-33)” dataset (NCES 2006d).  Small districts 
include local school boards, supervisory unions, regional education agencies, and other agencies, which 
primarily include charter schools.  Revenue data are available for the vast majority of districts.  Average 
revenues for all small districts were estimated by a) calculating the average revenues of each type of 
district based on available data, b) multiplying the average revenues by the total number of districts of 
that type, then c) calculating the sum of the resulting total revenues and dividing by the total number of 
small districts.  This approach presumes that there is no non-response bias among districts within each 
category.  
 Table 6-47 presents small district revenue calculations and resulting estimates.  The total estimated 
average revenues in column 7 ($15.5 million) are adjusted to 2008 dollars before being used to estimate 
cost-to-revenue ratios in Section 6.2.7.4.

6.2.8 Private Schools (Small Non-Profits) 
6.2.8.1 Number of Small Private Schools 
As discussed in Chapter 2, according to the 2003-2004 NCES Private School Universe Survey Data, there 
are a total of 26,531 private schools with kindergarten or pre-kindergarten programs in the United States 
(NCES 2006e,f).  Based on HUD data, 58 percent, or 15,387 of these schools were constructed before 
1978.  Because no data source providing the number of private schools at different revenue levels was 
identified, all private schools are considered to be small entities.  In other words, the analysis assumes that 
each private school is independently run and is not part of a larger organization.  As such, the analysis 
may overestimate the number of affected non-profit organizations and the impacts of the rule on these 
entities.  
Similar to public schools, private schools will only incur direct costs as a result of this rule if they use 
their own maintenance staff to perform regulated RRP work.  Schools that perform regulated jobs in-
house will incur dust wipe testing and clearance costs as a result of the proposed rule.  This analysis 
assumes that private schools with fewer than 100 students will contract out all of their renovation and 
repair work because of their small size, and costs and impacts associated with work performed by a 
contractor are accounted for in the contractor section of this analysis.  Private schools serving more than 
100 students are assumed to use their own staff to perform all painting and window/door carpentry work 
and to hire contractors to perform all other regulated RRP activities.   
As discussed in detail in Chapter 2, based on NCES’s Private School Universe survey data, 41 percent of 
private schools with a kindergarten and/or pre-kindergarten have fewer than 100 students.  Table 6-49 
presents the total number of private schools regulated in a typical year, the number of schools with fewer 
than 100 students, and the number of schools with more than 100 students.  The use of average annual 
numbers accounts for the fact that after the first year, the numbers of pre-1978 schools are expected to 
decrease by 0.41 percent per year due to building demolition.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 
Although 6,174 private schools are regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule, only a fraction of these 
buildings will undergo renovation requiring dust wipe testing or clearance in a typical year.  It is 
estimated that an average of 81 private school buildings doing RRP work in-house will be affected by the 
proposed rule in a typical year.  
6.2.8.2 Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Costs – Private Schools 
Given the relative infrequency of dust wipe testing and clearance events, each affected private school is 
assumed to perform one event per year. The analysis in Chapter 4 demonstrated that private schools are 
not expected to typically perform enough dust wipe testing or clearance events annually to justify 
obtaining dust sampling technician training for one of their employees.  Instead, private schools are 
assumed to incur only third party dust wipe testing and clearance costs for the events that they perform.  
Table 6-50 presents the total number of private schools regulated in the first year, the total number of 
events performed in these schools, and the total annualized costs associated with these events.  Total costs 
are estimated by multiplying the average annual number of events by the average annualized cost per dust 
sampling or clearance event ($789; see Table 6-23).  Average annualized costs per private school are 
calculated by dividing total rule costs by the number of affected schools.

6.2.8.3 Impact of the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on Private Schools 
Conceptually, impacts on non-profit establishments such as schools might be measured in terms of the 
ratio of rule costs to annual operating expenses.  Due to the scarcity of data on private school operating 
expenditures (schools are excluded from the U.S. Economic Census, and NCES does not have a financial 
data set for private schools), annual private school expenditures are approximated based on estimated 
operating expenses per student obtained from a 1995 study by NCES entitled Estimates of Expenditures 
for Private K-12 Schools and information on the number of students enrolled at each school as reported in 
NCES’s 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey data set.   
Based on NCES data (1995), this analysis estimates that private school expenditures average about $3,727 
(2008$) per child per year.  Appendix 6A explains the derivation of this estimate in detail. 
To estimate average private school expenditures for schools with over 100 students operating pre-
kindergarten or kindergarten programs, the average number of students per school meeting this criteria 
was calculated based on 2003-2004 NCES survey data (NCES 2006f).  Schools for which no total student 
enrollment data was available were assumed to have the average enrollment at schools with more than 
100 students where student data was provided.  Using these assumptions, the average private school with 
over 100 students was estimated to serve 283 students per year.  As such, average expenditures for private 
schools are estimated to be $3,727*283, or $1,054,684.   
 Chapter 6 6-41 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
Impacts on private schools were estimated by dividing the total annualized dust sampling and clearance 
costs incurred by these schools by the number of regulated schools.  Average costs per school were then 
divided by average expenditures to calculate a cost-to-expenditure ratio.  These calculations and the 
resulting ratio are presented in Table 6-51.

6.2.9 Summary of the Proposed LRRP Clearance Rule Impacts on Small Governments, 
Non-Profit Organizations, and Small For-Profit Businesses 
The vast majority of entities in the industries affected by the proposed rule are small.  As a result of the 
proposed revisions, approximately 203,002 small entities would incur additional costs.   
6.2.9.1 Incremental Impacts of the Proposed Rule 
The average annualized incremental cost of the proposed rule to a typical small entity is estimated to 
range from $490 to $1,928 depending on the number of renovation, repair, and painting events undertaken 
by a small entity in the industry sector involved.  As shown in Table 6-52, the incremental cost impact of 
the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule on small currently regulated entities ranges from about 0.004 percent 
to 1.059 percent of revenues, depending on the industry sector.

6.3 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, establishes requirements for 
Federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and Tribal governments, 
and the private sector.  Under section 202 of the UMRA, EPA generally must prepare a written statement, 
including a cost-benefit analysis, for rules with “Federal mandates” that might result in expenditures by 
State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more 
(when adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.16 
Before promulgating a regulation for which a written statement is needed, section 205 of the UMRA 
generally requires EPA to identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt 
the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the 
rule.  The provisions of section 205 do not apply when they are inconsistent with applicable law.  
Moreover, section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the least costly, most cost-effective, 
or least burdensome alternative if the Administrator publishes with the rule an explanation of why that 
alternative was not adopted.  Before EPA establishes any regulatory requirements that might significantly 
or uniquely affect small governments, including Tribal governments, it must have developed under 
section 203 of the UMRA a small government agency plan.  The plan must provide for notifying 
potentially affected small governments, enabling officials of affected small governments to have 
meaningful and timely input in the development of EPA regulatory proposals with significant 
intergovernmental mandates, and informing, educating, and advising small governments on compliance 
with regulatory requirements.  This section identifies the government entities that may be affected by the 
proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule.   
6.3.1 Affected Government Entities 
The proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule will affect activities in publicly owned child-occupied 
facilities, specifically publicly owned housing and public schools.17  As with the private sector, the 
                                                          
16  When the original $100 million UMRA threshold is adjusted for inflation from 1995 to 2008 dollars using an 
implicit price deflator for gross domestic product, the result is a threshold of $130 million. 
17 It is possible that government agencies also operate some of the childcare facilities included in the daycare center 
counts throughout this economic analysis.  Due to insufficient data, it was not possible to estimate the number 
of such government-run facilities, or the number or size of the agencies that operate them.  As such, this 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act discussion is limited to public school districts. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-44 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule will increase the cost of operating these facilities by requiring dust wipe 
testing or clearance after a subset of their in-house renovation activities.  Each school district that uses its 
own in-house staff to perform covered RRP activities in regulated buildings is required to comply with 
the Clearance Rule provisions.  Since the cost comparison in Chapter 4 indicated that public schools are 
not likely to choose to obtain training for an in-house dust sampling technician, state and local 
governments will only incur incremental costs of paying for third party dust wipe testing and clearance 
services following the affected renovation events.  
While most of what is commonly referred to as public housing is owned by state or local governments 
and provided for the benefit of low-income and/or elderly households, other public entities (such as public 
colleges and universities) may provide housing regulated under the LRRP rule.  As with the private 
sector, the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule will increase the cost of operating this housing by requiring 
that dust wipe testing and clearance be performed.  The increased cost is estimated to be $167 on average 
per renovation in Target Housing.18 
6.3.2 Expenditures by State, Local, and Tribal Governments – Public School Districts 
State, local, and Tribal governments will incur the incremental costs imposed by the proposed revisions to 
the 2008 LRRP rule when public school districts engage in certain RRP activities.19  Based on available 
data and the economic analysis presented in Chapter 4 and Section 6.1, it is assumed that all public school 
districts will perform all painting and window/door carpentry tasks themselves.  Public schools are 
assumed to hire third-party contractors to perform the remainder of their RRP work.  Since all public 
school districts are assumed to use their own staff to perform some of their RRP activities, all public 
school districts would need to comply with the dust wipe testing and clearance requirements outlined in 
Chapter 4.20  Although 7,051 districts and 20,541 buildings were regulated under the 2008 LRRP Rule, 
the very low expected number of dust wipe testing and clearance events in public and commercial 
building COFs implies a lower number of affected entities.  The number of districts affected by the 
proposed LRRP Clearance Rule is estimated as the annual average number of buildings performing an in-
house RRP event which would require dust wipe testing or clearance.  Table 6-54 presents the estimated 
total annualized incremental costs of the proposed rule that would be incurred by public school districts 
under the proposed option. 
                                                          
18 This average cost is calculated as the total target housing event costs in the first year divided by the total number 
of target housing events in the first year. 
19 As discussed in Chapter 4, states would be able to apply for, and receive authorization to administer these 
proposed requirements, but would be under no obligation to do so.   
20 It is important to note that this analysis uses a 75 percent compliance rate.  See Chapter 4 and the small entity 
analysis (Section 6.1) for a more comprehensive discussion of these cost estimates.

6.4 Executive Order 13132 - Federalism 
Executive Order 13132, entitled Federalism (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999), directs federal agencies to 
consider whether a rule has federalism implications (i.e. whether it has substantial direct effects on the 
states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power 
and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132). 
As discussed in Chapter 4, states would be able to apply for and receive authorization to administer these 
requirements but would be under no obligation to do so.  In the absence of a state authorization, EPA will 
administer these requirements.  While the cost analysis assumes that EPA will administer and enforce the 
program in all places, it also assumes that states would incur similar costs if they administer and enforce 
the regulation.  To the extent that they operate target housing or child-occupied facilities, states may incur 
costs due to the requirement that dust wipe testing and clearance procedures be followed after certain 
high-dust-generating renovation activities.  Given the low frequency of these events, this rule is not 
expected to have a significant impact on states. 
6.5 Executive Order 13175 - Tribal Implications 
Executive Order 13175, entitled Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (59 FR 
22951, November 6, 2000), directs federal agencies to consider whether a rule has tribal implications (i.e. 
whether it has substantial direct effects on tribal governments, on the relationship between the Federal 
government and the Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes).   
 Chapter 6 6-45 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-46 
Under the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule, Tribes would be able to apply for and receive authorization to 
administer these requirements on Tribal lands, but Tribes would be under no obligation to do so.  In the 
absence of a Tribal authorization, EPA will administer these requirements. 
To the extent that Tribes operate target housing or child-occupied facilities, they may incur costs due to 
the requirement that dust wipe testing and clearance procedures must be followed after certain high-dust-
generating renovation activities.  Given the low frequency of these events, this rule is not expected to 
have a significant impact on Tribal Governments. 
6.6 Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risk and Safety Risks 
Under Executive Order 13045, a regulation must be reviewed if the regulatory action is economically 
significant and concerns an environmental health risk or safety risk that may disproportionately affect 
children.  Since children are particularly susceptible to the IQ loss and adverse health effects caused by 
exposure to lead dust, a significant objective of the proposed revisions to the 2008 LRRP rule is the 
protection of children’s health.  Implementing the Clearance Rule provision protects children under the 
age of six by ensuring that their homes, schools, or daycares, are truly free from lead hazards before a 
child may re-occupy the space.  This analysis summarizes the effects of the regulation on children under 
the age of six in target housing units and in COFs in public or commercial buildings. 
6.6.1 Children Affected by the Proposed Clearance Rule Revision 
The 2008 LRRP Rule included all COFs in public and commercial buildings, all rental units, plus all 
target housing COFs, and all owner-occupied target housing units where a child under the age of 6 or a 
pregnant woman resides within pre-1987 buildings.  A target housing unit where a child visits regularly, 
but spends fewer that 6 hours a week is not considered a child-occupied facility, and will only be 
regulated if the opt-out provision is eliminated as has been proposed (providing that there is no child 
under the age of six or pregnant woman that resides in the unit).  Thus, children visiting these housing 
units may also benefit from the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule through a reduction in potential 
exposures to lead dust during these visits. 
It is expected that the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule will benefit children both located in target housing 
and public and commercial building COFs.  Increasing the awareness of lead hazards through dust wipe 
testing reports and ensuring elimination of hazards prior to re-occupancy through clearance testing will 
increase the health outcomes of these groups of children.  In the first year of the proposed rule, 1.1 million 
children are expected to reside or occupy (i.e., receive childcare or attend school in) structures where dust 
wipe testing or clearance was performed following a renovation that disturbed lead based paint. 
6.7 Executive Order 13211 - Energy Effects 
Executive Order 13211, entitled Actions Concerning Regulations that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, 
Distribution, or Use (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001), directs federal agencies to identify actions that will 
have a significant adverse energy effect.  Adverse effects are defined as: 
• Reductions in crude oil supply in excess of 10,000 barrels per day;  
• Reductions in fuel production in excess of 4,000 barrels per day;  
• Reductions in coal production in excess of 5 million tons per year;  
• Reductions in natural gas production in excess of 25 million mcf per year;  
• Reductions in electricity production in excess of 1 billion kilowatt-hours per year or in excess of 
500 megawatts of installed capacity;  
• Increases in energy use required by the regulatory action that exceed any of the thresholds above;  
• Increases in the cost of energy production in excess of one percent;  
• Increases in the cost of energy distribution in excess of one percent; or  
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-47 
• Other similarly adverse outcomes.  
The regulations under consideration will not significantly reduce energy production nor significantly 
increase energy costs. 
6.8 National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act 
Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (“NTTAA”), Public 
Law No. 104-113, 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs federal agencies to use voluntary consensus 
standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impractical.  Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials 
specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted 
by voluntary consensus standards bodies.  The NTTAA directs federal agencies to provide Congress, 
through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary 
consensus standards. 
This proposed rulemaking does not involve technical standards. Therefore, EPA is not considering the use 
of any voluntary consensus standards.  
6.9 Executive Order 12898 – Environmental Justice 
Under Executive Order 12898, when promulgating a regulation, EPA investigates whether there are 
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income 
populations.  The LRRP regulation requires that establishments, when undertaking certain types of 
renovation activities in regulated facilities, reduce the risk of exposure to lead by using dust wipe testing 
and clearance practices following cleaning verification to ensure the safety of the work area prior to re-
occupancy.  This environmental justice analysis first summarizes a few important points to consider when 
viewing the results.  Next a summary of the impacts from the regulation on minority and low-income 
populations in target housing units and child-occupied facilities is presented.  Racial minorities and low-
income households stand to accrue benefits as a result of the proposed revision to the LRRP rule. 
The dust wipe sampling, laboratory testing, report-writing, and re-cleaning required by the proposed rule 
will increase the costs for renovation, repair and painting activities that are already regulated under the 
2008 LRRP rule and the subsequent proposed Opt-Out rule.  These additional costs may lead some lower 
income homeowners of properties in lower income neighborhoods to avoid using certified renovators or 
recommended practices.  When taking an average of costs to all residential RRP events in target housing 
affected by the rule, the incremental costs of the dust wipe testing and clearance requirements would be 
$160.21  These costs are likely to be a small part of the total cost of the major renovation, repair, and 
painting projects that are affected by the proposed rule.  EPA believes that these costs are unlikely to 
result in significant changes in consumer behavior.  
6.9.1 Target Housing Dust Wipe Testing and Clearance Events 
This section evaluates the distribution of regulated renovation events in target housing units and the 
individuals protected across three race and two income groups.  Although it would be preferable to 
perform a joint environmental justice analysis for the race and income groups, relevant data are not 
available to make these population inferences.  Therefore, the analysis was performed separately for the 
race and income groups. 
                                                          
21 This average cost is calculated as the total target housing event costs in the first year divided by the total number 
of target housing events in the first year. 
Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-48 
6.9.1.1 Low Income 
EPA defines low income individuals as individuals whose income are below the level set by the federal 
government’s official poverty definition.  Based on data from the 2000 Decennial Census, 12.4% of 
individuals were living below the poverty level (U.S. Census Bureau 2000a).  The analysis evaluates 
whether implementation of the LRRP Clearance Rule revision will have a disproportionately greater 
effect on low income individuals. 
For the purposes of the target housing portion of this analysis, EPA defines low income individuals as 
individuals whose income are below the level set by the federal government’s official poverty definition.  
Based on data from the 2000 Decennial Census, 12.4% of individuals were living below the poverty level 
(U.S. Census Bureau 2000a).  It is therefore relevant to determine if the potential costs and benefits 
resulting from the LRRP regulations will have a disproportionately greater effect on low income 
individuals. 
 
The data in Table 6-56 presents the numbers of households below the poverty level that own or rent their 
home.  As a result of the proposed LRRP Clearance Rule revision, the likelihood of high levels of lead 
dust remaining in residential housing post-renovation decreases significantly, and occupants become more 
aware of potential lead hazards.  Only households built prior to 1978 would potentially be affected by the 
proposed revisions.  About 4.5 percent of pre-1980 owner-occupied housing units have residents below 
the poverty line.

6.9.1.2 Race: 
This section of the environmental justice analysis considers the impacts of the proposed revisions across 
three race categories.  The data in Table 6-57 compares the percentages of owners and renters for three 
categories of race, “White Alone,” “Black/African American Alone,” and “Asian Alone.”  The 2000 
Census data shows that Black/African American households and Asian households are almost as likely to 
reside in owner housing as rental housing.

6.9.2 Conclusions 
The proposed rule seeks to provide greater assurance that dust-lead hazards created by renovations are 
adequately cleaned up, primarily by requiring renovation firms to provide building owners and occupants 
with information on dust lead levels remaining in the work area after many renovation projects, but also 
by requiring renovation firms to demonstrate that they have achieved regulatory clearance levels after 
some of the dustiest renovations.  As such, EPA concludes that the proposed revisions to the rule will not 
lead to disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low 
income populations in regulated target housing units.

APPENDIX 6A – Estimating average per-pupil expenditures of private schools   
This appendix outlines the methodology used to estimate total annual private school expenditures for the 
small entity analysis.  Total annual school expenditures were estimated based on per-student operating 
expense data and information on the number of students enrolled.  This analysis used per-pupil 
expenditure values for 1991-92, first calculated in a working paper published by the National Center for 
Education Statistics (NCES) entitled “Estimates of Expenditures for Private K-12 Schools” (NCES 1995). 
The two mean per-pupil expenditure values (one for elementary schools and one for combined schools) 
presented were combined into one value - the private school per-pupil expenditure value - using selected 
weights.  Finally, this value was inflated to 2005 dollars using the CPI.  The inflated value was used to 
estimate the total expenditures of private schools with various sized student bodies.  
The NCES working paper divided 1991-92 Private School Survey (PSS) data into 19 mutually exclusive 
and exhaustive sectors of schools based on grade level (elementary, secondary, and combined elementary 
and secondary), and religious or other affiliation.  The paper relied on expenditure data collected by three 
school associations (The National Catholic Education Association (NCEA), the Lutheran Church-
Missouri Synod (LCNS), and the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS)) to calculate 
average annual per-student expenditures for their associated schools.  Data from the three surveyed school 
associations accounted for 45% of the total private school as presented in the PSS (NCES 1995).  For the 
remaining schools, NCES estimated two sets of per-student expenditures using data obtained from 
Catholic and Lutheran schools (referred to as the Catholic and Lutheran School Models, respectively).  
Table 6A-1 presents the number of schools and the annual per-student expenditures for the 19 sectors of 
schools using the Lutheran school data to estimate missing expenditure values.

Catholic School Model because, based on the evidence presented in NCES’s study, Lutheran school data 
are likely to be more accurate.  Specifically, when assessing the quality of the data, the working paper 
authors express concern over potential non-response bias and sampling error in the Catholic elementary 
and secondary school data.  In addition, a comparison of the total operating expenses of private 
elementary and secondary schools generated by each model with an alternate estimate calculated annually 
by NCES indicated that while that both the Catholic and the Lutheran School Model estimates are below 
the alternative NCES estimates, the Lutheran School Model is the closer of the two.22  Therefore the 
Lutheran School Model was used in this analysis.  
To estimate per-student expenditures for schools likely to be affected by the proposed revisions to the 
LRRP Rule, the school sectors most likely to contain schools with pre-kindergarten and kindergarten

programs were identified in the NCES study.  Table 6A-2 shows Table 6A-1 with an additional column 
indicating whether or not the estimated mean for that sector was included in the calculation for mean per-
private-school-pupil expenditure based on the assumptions made about the likelihood of that sector 
containing a kindergarten or pre-kindergarten program.  An “x” indicates that the mean per-pupil 
expenditure value is included in the calculation.

Of the 19 sectors, 6 are for secondary schools only.  Since the working paper notes that secondary 
schools23 spend more than twice as much as elementary schools spend per pupil, and are the least likely, 
by definition, to contain a COF, they are excluded from the calculation of the mean per-pupil expenditure 
value.

Economic Analysis for the LRRP Clearance Proposed Rule 
 
 Chapter 6 6-53 
For elementary schools24, the $2,003 mean per-pupil expenditure cost was selected.  This value represents 
8,887 of the 17,093 (52%) elementary schools presented in the working paper.  Though Catholic schools 
represent approximately 45 percent of all elementary schools, their associated mean per-pupil expenditure 
estimate is not used due to the potential bias discussed above.  The remaining elementary school per-pupil 
expenditure values are between 3 and 4 times larger than the chosen value; however these means 
represent schools unlikely to be affected by the LRRP rule.  For example, the mean per-pupil expenditure 
values presented for NAIS schools (449 of the 561 remaining schools) are much higher since “a relatively 
large proportion of NAIS schools are boarding schools and expenditures for dormitories are apparently 
included in the total operating expenditures for these schools.” It is unlikely that a COF would be found in 
a boarding school.  The remaining 112 schools are special education elementary schools, which are more 
costly because of their unique needs and are also less likely to contain a COF.  Furthermore, as the 
working paper notes, “preschool is probably less expensive than other grades,” and therefore, it is likely 
that the average across all elementary schools ($2,125) would overstate expenditures. 
For combined schools, the $4,527 mean per-pupil expenditure cost is used. 25  This value represents 5,028 
of the 6,285 (80%) combined schools presented in the working paper.  The other mean per-pupil values 
are roughly double this value, pulling the mean for all combined schools up to $5,766. This higher value 
is not used as it most likely overstates the expenditures given that boarding schools and special education 
schools are again included in the calculation. 
In order to obtain one private school per-pupil expenditure value, the previously discussed elementary 
school and combined school data were weighted.  The weights were based on the current proportions of 
elementary schools and combined schools with either a pre-kindergarten or kindergarten program.  In 
order to calculate the weights, this analysis used the data set underlying the National Center for Education 
Statistics (NCES) report entitled “Characteristics of Private Schools in the United States: Results From 
the 2003-2004 Private School Universe Survey.” Note that it was assumed that per-student expenditures 
at K-terminal schools were the same as in elementary schools. 26 
In 2003-2004, there were a total of 18,289 private elementary schools and 4,338 private combined schools 
with pre-K or kindergarten programs.  Thus, a weight of 0.81 (18,289/22,627) was attached to the mean 
per-pupil elementary school expenditure value and a weight of 0.19 (4,338/22,627) was attached to the 
mean per-pupil combined school expenditure value.  This calculation yields a final private school per-
pupil expenditure value of $2,426. 
Because the study is based on 1991-1992 PSS data, it was assumed that expenditure values were in 1992 
dollars. Taking into account inflation, $2,426 in 1992 dollars is equivalent to $3,377 in 2006 dollars (U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics 2006). 
                                                          
24 Defined as having a highest grade of less than or equal to 8th. 
25 A combined school is defined as having a highest grade less than or equal to 12th and a lowest grade less than or 
equal to 5th. 
26 A K-terminal school is defined as a school for which kindergarten is the highest grade. In the 2003-2004 PSS, K-
terminals represented an estimated 22% of all private schools with either a kindergarten or pre-kindergarten 
program.
