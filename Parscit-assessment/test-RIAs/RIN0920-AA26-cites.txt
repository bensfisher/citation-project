Those applicants testing positive for HIV, if eligible, would still be required to apply for and obtain a waiver from DHS prior to coming to the U.S. There are several disadvantages to this approach. As stated previously, while HIV infection is a serious health condition, it does not represent a communicable disease that is a significant threat for introduction, transmission, and spread to the U.S. population through casual contact. Currently, there are already roughly 1 million persons in the United States living with HIV [1]. Thus, maintaining HIV infection on the list of excludable conditions for entry into the U.S. would not result in significant public health benefits. Further, this approach is not in line with current international public health practice. This approach continues discriminatory practices and contributes toward the stigmatization of HIV-infected persons. HHS/CDC did not select this approach. 2. The second approach is to remove HIV infection from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance, i.e. remove it as a ground of inadmissibility into the U.S., but continue mandatory HI</context>

The medical examination offers a unique opportunity to both inform immigrants of their HIV status and link them with care. Through screening, HIV-infected aliens who are potentially unaware of their HIV status would become aware of their status and could be linked with prevention, care and treatment options in the United States. Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected persons can increase life expectancy and may improve the quality of life. Additionally, knowing one’s HIV status decreases the likelihood of onward transmission [2, 3]. These public health benefits are the basis for the HHS/CDC’s ‘‘Revised Recommendations for HIV Testing of Adults, Adolescents, and Pregnant Women in Health-Care Settings,’’ which states that the characteristics of HIV infection are consistent with all generally accepted criteria that justify voluntary screening [4].

This means that mandatory testing for HIV infection would no longer be required and DHS would allow HIV-infected persons to enter into the U.S. (or to adjust to permanent resident status) if they meet all other conditions of admissibility. This is the regulatory approach that HHS/CDC selected. Along with this approach, all immigrants, refugees and status adjusters would still have the opportunity to receive information about HIV testing and to be tested in the United States as recommended by the CDC guidelines [4]. The discussion of the potential impacts of the rule that follow relate to this approach. C. Baseline and Incremental Analysis The baseline for this analysis assumes no change in the current regulation. In other words, all applicants for admission into the U.S. as legal permanent residents and those already within the U.S. seeking adjustment to permanent resident status are currently tested for HIV during the immigration medical exam. Those who are HIVinfected and are not granted a waiver by the Department of Homeland Security are refused lawful permanent resident status in the United States.</context>

We used a range of 1.02 to 6.09 HIV-infected persons per 1,000 immigrants based on 25% and 150% of the mean weighted average, 4.06 per 1,000 immigrants (high and low estimates) of the number of estimated HIV-infected persons in each region but weighted by the number of lawful permanent residents who entered the U.S. in 2007. This range yields a lower bound estimate of 1,073 and an upper bound estimate of 6,409 HIVinfected persons entering the United States annually (see Technical Appendix II [5]). Because the impact of the proposed rule change is highly sensitive to HIV prevalence in aliens entering the U.S., we are seeking comment on these assumptions. E. Benefits HHS/CDC is proposing to remove HIV infection from the definition of communicable disease of public health significance contained in 42 CFR 34.2(b) and scope of examination, 42 CFR 34.3 because HIV infection does not represent a communicable disease that is a significant threat to the general U.S. population.

Furthermore, HIV treatment yields benefits that offset the expenditures, including increased life expectancy and productivity. However, given that health care expenditures associated with treatment of HIV infection can be substantial and may result in some fiscal impacts (as discussed below), we developed a model (HIVEcon) to estimate these potential effects of the rule. A complete description of the model including assumptions, results and limitations is available for comment [5]. The spreadsheet model itself is also available for download so that the reader can determine the relative impact of altering almost any input value, individually or several simultaneously [12]. The model, HIVEcon, examines the treatment costs as estimated by Schackman et al. [13] associated with newly identified persons infected with HIV regardless of payer, following the 2004 standards of care. The annual treatment cost is estimated to be $25,200 in 2004 dollars, with a range of $19,466 to $30,954.

These estimates imply treatment costs, for those infected via onward transmission only, in the first year of $1.6 million in the primary estimate and a range of $0 to $8.1 million [5]. For the purposes of calculating new HIV infections associated with HIVinfected immigrants in the U.S., HIVEcon adds persons infected by HIVinfected immigrants to the cohort of projected HIV-infected immigrants. This modeling technique represents the chain of onward transmission after initial transmission from an HIVinfected immigrant. Thus, in the next year, though the cumulative number of HIV-infected immigrants essentially doubles, the number of new HIV cases (as well as the associated treatment costs) will be slightly more than double the previous year.

Costs To the extent the proposed rule will result in an increased number of HIVinfected immigrants to the U.S. each year, there will be quantifiable impacts. We have made our best attempt to capture the likely effects of the rule, but there are significant uncertainties in this estimation effort. HHS/CDC encourages public comment on costs associated with this rulemaking and, in particular, additional information that would provide a basis for more robust qualitative discussion or quantita</context>

An alternative interpretation may be that at least some of the additional infections are occurring earlier than they otherwise would have. Thus, these shifts in the timing of infection will increase the total number of new cases in any one year, but the true incremental impact may be the implications of becoming infected earlier. Furthermore, the model treats the onward transmission rate as fixed over time. However, data shows that onward transmission has declined over time [19]. If we assume that transmission rates will continue to decrease in the future, it is possible that the model may overestimate the number of HIVinfected individuals due to onward transmission as we project impacts into the future. G. Summary of Impacts The HIVEcon model projects potential impacts out to 50 years after the rules go into effect. However, many of the key inputs to the model may be significantly different even ten years from now given the rapid pace of change in HIV treatment, HIV prevalence in other countries, as well as potential changes in the overall immigration policy.

Those applicants testing positive for HIV, if eligible, would still be required to apply for and obtain a waiver from DHS prior to coming to the U.S. There are several disadvantages to this approach. As stated previously, while HIV infection is a serious health condition, it does not represent a communicable disease that is a significant threat for introduction, transmission, and spread to the U.S. population through casual contact. Currently, there are already roughly 1 million persons in the United States living with HIV [1]. Thus, maintaining HIV infection on the list of excludable conditions for entry into the U.S. would not result in significant public health benefits. Further, this approach is not in line with current international public health practice. This approach continues discriminatory practices and contributes toward the stigmatization of HIV-infected persons. HHS/CDC did not select this approach. 2. The second approach is to remove HIV infection from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance, i.e. remove it as a ground of inadmissibility into the U.S., but continue mandatory HI</context>

Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV-infected persons can increase life expectancy and may improve the quality of life. Additionally, knowing one’s HIV status decreases the likelihood of onward transmission [2, 3].
