EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) presents the health and welfare benefits, costs, 
and other impacts of the proposed Toxics Rule (the Utility MACT and NSPS proposals) in 2016. 
1.1 Key Findings 
This proposed rule will reduce emissions of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) including 
mercury from the electric power industry. As a co-benefit, the emissions of certain PM2.5 
precursors such as SO2 will also decline. EPA estimates that this proposed rule will yield annual 
monetized benefits (in 2007$) of between $59 to $140 billion using a 3% discount rate and $53 
and $130 billion using a 7% discount rate.  The great majority of the estimates are attributable to 
co-benefits from reductions in PM2.5-related mortality.  The annual social costs are $10.9 billion 
(2007$) and the annual quantified net benefits are $48 to $130 billion using 3% discount rate or 
$42 to $120 billion using a 7% discount rate. The benefits outweigh costs by between 5 to 1 or 
13 to 1 depending on the benefit estimate and discount rate used.  The co-benefits are 
substantially attributable to the 6,800 to 17,000 fewer PM2.5-related premature mortalities.  There 
are some costs and important benefits that EPA could not monetize, such as those for the HAP 
being reduced by this proposed rule other than mercury. Upon considering these limitations and 
uncertainties, it remains clear that the benefits of the proposed Toxics Rule are substantial and 
far outweigh the costs.  The annualized private compliance costs to the power industry in 2015 
are $10.9 billion (2007$). Employment impacts associated with the proposed rule are estimated 
to be small.  Effective policies to support end-use energy efficiency investments can reduce 
compliance costs and lessen impacts on electric rates and bills.  In 2015, annualized private 
compliance costs to the industry are reduced by $0.3 billion (2007$) under an illustrative energy 
efficiency scenario.1 
The benefits and costs in 2016 of the proposed rule are in Table 1-1.

 This is based on the illustrative energy efficiency sensitivity analysis discussed in Section 8.13 and Appendix D.

a
 All estimates are rounded to two significant digits and represent annualized benefits and costs anticipated for the 
year 2016.  For notational purposes, unquantified benefits are indicated with a ―B‖ to represent the sum of 
additional monetary benefits and disbenefits. Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these endpoints, and 
as such, these benefits are inherently more uncertain than those benefits that we were able to quantify. A listing of 
health and welfare effects is provided in Table 1-5. Estimates here are subject to uncertainties discussed further in 
the body of the document. 
b
 The reduction in premature mortalities account for over 90% of total monetized benefits. Valuation assumes 
discounting over the SAB-recommended 20-year segmented lag structure described in Chapter 6.  Results reflect 
3 percent and 7 percent discount rates consistent with EPA and OMB guidelines for preparing economic analyses 
(U.S. EPA, 2000; OMB, 2003). 
c 
Social costs are estimated using the MultiMarket model, the model employed by EPA in this RIA to estimate 
economic impacts of the proposal to industries outside the electric power sector. This model does not estimate 
indirect impacts associated with a regulation such as this one.  Details on the social cost estimates can be found in 
Chapter 9 and Appendix E of this RIA. 
d
 Potential benefit categories that have not been quantified and monetized are listed in Table 1-5. 
1.1.1 Health Benefits 
The proposed Toxics Rule is expected to yield significant health benefits by reducing 
emissions not only of HAP such as mercury, but also significant co-benefits due to reductions in 
direct fine particles and in two key contributors to fine particle formation.  Sulfur dioxide 
contributes to the formation of fine particle pollution (PM2.5), and nitrogen oxide contributes to 
the formation of PM2.5. 
Our analyses suggest this rule would yield benefits in 2016 of $59 to $140 billion (based 
on a 3 percent discount rate) and $53 to $130 billion (based on a 7 percent discount rate). This 
estimate reflects the economic value of a range of avoided health outcomes, including 510 fewer 
mercury-related IQ points lost as well as a variety of avoided PM2.5-related impacts, including 
6,800 to 17,000 premature deaths, 11,000 nonfatal heart attacks, 5,300 hospitalizations for 
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, 850,000 lost work days and 5.1 million days when adults 
restrict normal activities because of respiratory symptoms exacerbated by PM2.5. This rule is also 
likely to produce significant ozone-related benefits, which we were unable to quantify in the RIA 
 1-3 
due to the limitations of the scaling approach used to estimate benefits; further details may be 
found in the benefits chapter. 
We also estimate substantial additional health improvements for children from reductions 
in upper and lower respiratory illnesses, acute bronchitis, and asthma attacks.  See Table 1-2 for 
a list of the annual reduction in health effects expected in 2016 and Table 1-3 for the estimated 
value of those reductions. 
We also include in our monetized benefits estimates the effect from the reduction in CO2 
emissions that is an outcome of this proposal.  We calculate the benefits associated with these 
emission reductions using the social cost of carbon (SCC) approach, an approach that has been 
used to estimate such benefits in several recent rulemakings (e.g., proposed Transport Rule, final 
industrial boilers major and source area sources rules). 
1.1.2 Welfare Benefits 
The term welfare benefits covers both environmental and societal benefits of reducing 
pollution, such as reductions in damage to ecosystems, improved visibility and improvements in 
recreational and commercial fishing, agricultural yields, and forest productivity.

 Estimates rounded to two significant figures. The negative estimates for certain endpoints are the result of the 
weak statistical power of the study used to calculate these health impacts and do not suggest that increases in 
air pollution exposure result in decreased health impacts. Confidence intervals reflect random sampling error 
and not the additional uncertainty associated with benefits scaling described above. 
1
 The national scale assessment conducted for the RIA focuses on the exposures to methylmercury in 
populations who consume self-caught freshwater fish (recreational fishers and their families, especially 
women of child-bearing age). Benefits reflect estimated avoided IQ loss for children, as projected based on 
fertility rates applied to the women of child-bearing age, among all recreational freshwater anglers in the 48 
contiguous U.S. states. 
2
As noted in chapter 5, monetized benefits estimates are for an immediate change in MeHg levels in fish (i.e., 
the potential lag period associated with fully realizing fish tissue MeHg levels was not reflected in benefits 
modeling). If a lag in the response of MeHg levels in fish were assumed, the monetized benefits could be 
significantly lower, depending on the length of the lag and the discount rate used.  As noted in the discussion 
of the Mercury Maps modeling, the relationship between deposition and fish tissue MeHg is proportional in 
equilibrium, but the MMaps approach does not provide any information on the time lag of response. 
3
Monetized benefits estimates reported here are for the implementation year: 2016. As such, certain health 
endpoints that take years to manifest, such as avoided IQ loss from MeHg prenatal exposure, may not be fully 
quantified in the analysis year.  
Figure 1-1 summarizes an array of PM2.5-related monetized benefits estimates based on 
alternative epidemiology and expert-derived PM-mortality estimate. 
Figure 1-2 summarizes the estimated net benefits for the proposed rule by displaying all 
possible combinations of PM and ozone-related monetized benefits and costs. Each of the 14 
bars in each graph represents a separate point estimate of net benefits under a certain 
combination of cost and benefit estimation methods. Because it is not a distribution, it is not 
possible to infer the likelihood of any single net benefit estimate.

1.2 Not All Benefits Quantified 
EPA was unable to quantify or monetize all of the health and environmental benefits 
associated with the proposed Toxics Rule.  EPA believes these unquantified benefits are 
substantial, including the overall value associated with HAP reductions, value of increased 
agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, visibility improvements, and reductions in 
nitrogen and acid deposition and the resulting changes in ecosystem functions.  Table 1-4 
provides a list of these benefits.

 In addition to primary economic endpoints, there are a number of biological responses that have been associated 
with PM health effects including morphological changes and altered host defense mechanisms.  The public health 
impact of these biological responses may be partly represented by our quantified endpoints. 
B
 Cohort estimates are designed to examine the effects of long term exposures to ambient pollution, but relative risk 
estimates may also incorporate some effects due to shorter term exposures (see Kunzli et al., 2001 for a discussion 
of this issue). While some of the effects of short term exposure are likely to be captured by the cohort estimates, 
there may be additional premature mortality from short term PM exposure not captured in the cohort estimates 
included in the primary analysis.

1.3 Costs, Economic, and Employment Impacts 
The projected annual incremental private costs of the proposed Toxics Rule to the electric 
power industry are $10.9 billion in 2015.  These costs represent the total cost to the electricity-
generating industry of reducing HAP emissions to meet the emissions limits set out in the rule.  
Estimates are in 2007 dollars.  These costs of the rule are estimated using the Integrated Planning 
Model (IPM). 
There are several national changes in energy prices that result from the proposed Toxics 
Rule.  Retail electricity prices are projected to increase nationally by an average of 3.7% in 2015 
with the proposed Toxics Rule.  On a weighted average basis, consumer natural gas price 
impacts are anticipated to range from 0.6% to 1.3% based on consumer class in response to the 
proposed Toxics Rule between 2015 and 2030. 
There are several other types of energy impacts associated with the proposed Toxics 
Rule.  A small amount of coal-fired capacity, about 9.9 GW (3 percent of all coal-fired capacity 
and 1 percent of all generating capacity in 2015), is projected to be uneconomic to maintain.  
These units are predominantly smaller and less frequently-used generating units dispersed 
throughout the area affected by the rule.  If current forecasts of either natural gas prices or 
electricity demand were revised in the future to be higher, that would create a greater incentive to 
keep these units operational.  Coal production for use in the power sector is projected to decrease 
by less than 2 percent by 2015, and we expect slightly reduced coal demand in Appalachia and 
the West with the proposed Toxics Rule. 
Effective policies to support end-use energy efficiency investments can reduce 
compliance costs, lessen impacts on electric rates and bills, and reduce the need for new 
capacity.  In 2015 and 2020, annualized private compliance costs to the industry are reduced by 
$0.3 billion (2007$) and $1.1 billion, respectively, under an energy efficiency scenario.  
Furthermore, the impacts of the Toxics Rule on retail electricity prices are reduced by 0.04 
cents/kWh and 0.38 cents/kWh in 2015 and 2020, respectively, and the need for new capacity is 
reduced by 0.3 GW and 8.5 GW, respectively, in 2015 and 2020 under an energy efficiency 
scenario. 
In addition to addressing the costs and benefits of the proposed Utility Air Toxics Rule 
(Toxics Rule), EPA has estimated a portion of the employment impacts of this rulemaking.  We 
have estimated two types of impacts.  One provides an estimate of the employment impacts on 
the regulated industry over time.  The second covers the short-term employment impacts 
associated with the construction of needed pollution control equipment until the compliance date 
 1-12 
of the regulation.  We expect that the rule‘s impact on employment will be small, but will (on 
net) result in an increase in employment. 
The approaches to estimate employment impacts use different analytical techniques and 
are applied to different industries during different time periods, and they use different units of 
analysis.  No overlapping estimates are summed.  Estimates from Morgenstern et al. (2002) are 
used to calculate the ongoing annual employment impacts for the regulated entities (the electric 
power sector).  The short term estimates for employment needed to design, construct, and install 
the control equipment in the three or four year period before the compliance date are also 
provided using an approach that estimates employment impacts for the environmental protection 
sector.  Finally some of the other types of employment impacts that will be ongoing are 
estimated but not summed because they omit some potentially important categories. 
In Table 1-5, we show the employment impacts of the Toxics Rule as estimated by the 
environmental protection sector approach and by the Morgenstern approach.

1.4 Small Entity and Unfunded Mandates Impacts 
After preparing an analysis of small entity impacts, EPA cannot certify that this proposal 
will not have a no SISNOSE (significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small 
entities).  Of the 83 small entities affected, 59 are projected to have costs greater than 1 percent 
of their revenues.  EPA‘s decision to exclude units smaller than 25 Megawatt capacity (MW) as 
per the requirements of the Clean Air Act has already significantly reduced the burden on small 
entities, and EPA participated in a Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act 
 1-13 
(SBREFA) to examine ways to mitigate the impact of the proposed Toxics Rule on affected 
small entities 
EPA examined the potential economic impacts on state and municipality-owned entities 
associated with this rulemaking based on assumptions of how the affected states will implement 
control measures to meet their emissions.  These impacts have been calculated to provide 
additional understanding of the nature of potential impacts and additional information. 
According to EPA‘s analysis, of the 96 government entities considered in this, 55 may 
experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of revenues in 2015, based on our 
assumptions of how the affected states implement control measures to meet their emissions 
budgets as set forth in this rulemaking. 
Government entities projected to experience compliance costs in excess of 1 percent of 
revenues may have some potential for significant impact resulting from implementation of the 
Toxics Rule. 
1.5 Limitations and Uncertainties 
Every analysis examining the potential benefits and costs of a change in environmental 
protection requirements is limited to some extent by data gaps, limitations in model capabilities 
(such as geographic coverage), and variability or uncertainties in the underlying scientific and 
economic studies used to configure the benefit and cost models.  Despite the uncertainties, we 
believe this benefit-cost analysis provides a reasonable indication of the expected economic 
benefits and costs of the proposed Toxics Rule. 
For this analysis, such uncertainties include possible errors in measurement and 
projection for variables such as population growth and baseline incidence rates; uncertainties 
associated with estimates of future-year emissions inventories and air quality; variability in the 
estimated relationships between changes in pollutant concentrations and the resulting changes in 
health and welfare effects; and uncertainties in exposure estimation. 
Below is a summary of the key uncertainties of the analysis: 
Costs 
 Analysis does not capture employment shifts as workers are retrained at the same 
company or re-employed elsewhere in the economy. 
 1-14 
 We do not include the costs of certain relatively small permitting costs associated 
with Title V that new program entrants face. 
 Technological innovation is not incorporated into these cost estimates.  Thus, these 
cost estimates may be potentially higher than what may occur in the future, all other 
things being the same. 
Benefits 
 The mercury concentration estimates for the analysis come from several different 
sources 
 The mercury concentration estimates used in the model were based on simple 
temporal and spatial averages of reported fish tissue samples. This approach assumes 
that the mercury samples are representative of ―local‖ conditions (i.e., within the 
same HUC 12) in similar waterbodies (i.e., rivers or lakes). 
 State-level averages for fishing behavior of recreational anglers are applied to each 
modeled census tract in the state; which does not reflect within-state variation in these 
factors. 
 Application of state-level fertility rates to specific census tracts (and specifically to 
women in angler households. 
 Applying the state-level individual level fishing participation rates to approximate the 
household fishing rates conditions at a block level. 
 Populations are only included in the model if they are within a reasonable distance of 
a waterbody with fish tissue MeHg samples.  This approach undercounts the exposed 
population (by roughly 40 to 45%) and leads to underestimates of national aggregate 
baseline exposures and risks and underestimates of the risk reductions and benefits 
resulting from mercury emission reductions. 
 Assumption of 8 g/day fish consumption rate for the general population in freshwater 
angler households. 
 The dose-response model used to estimate neurological effects on children because of 
maternal mercury body burden has several important uncertainties, including 
selection of IQ as a primary endpoint when there may be other more sensitive 
 1-15 
endpoints, selection of the blood-to-hair ratio for mercury, and the dose-response 
estimates from the epidemiological literature. Control for confounding from the 
potentially positive cognitive effects of fish consumption and, more specifically, 
omega-3 fatty acids. 
 Valuation of IQ losses using a lost earning approach has several uncertainties, 
including (1) there is a linear relationship between IQ changes and net earnings 
losses, (2) the unit value applies to even very small changes in IQ, and (3) the unit 
value will remain constant (in real present value terms) for several years into the 
future. Each unit value for IQ losses has two main sources of uncertainty (1). The 
statistical error in the average percentage change in earnings as a result of IQ changes 
and (2) estimates of average lifetime earnings and costs of schooling. Most of the 
estimated PM-related benefits in this rule accrue to populations exposed to higher 
levels of PM2.5.  Of these estimated PM-related mortalities avoided, about 30% occur 
among populations initially exposed to annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 µg/m
3
 and 
about 80% occur among those initially exposed to annual mean PM2.5 level of 7.5 
µg/m
3 
; these are the lowest air quality levels considered in the Laden et al. (2006) 
and Pope et al. (2002) studies, respectively. This fact is important, because as we 
estimate PM-related mortality among populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 that are 
successively lower, our confidence in the results diminishes. However, our analysis 
shows that a substantial portion of the impacts occur at higher exposures. 
 There are uncertainties related to the health impact functions used in the analysis.  
These include: within study variability; across study variation; the application of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions nationwide; extrapolation of impact functions 
across population; and various uncertainties in the C-R function, including causality 
and thresholds.  Therefore, benefits may be under- or over-estimates. 
 Analysis is for 2016, and projecting key variables introduces uncertainty.  Inherent in 
any analysis of future regulatory programs are uncertainties in projecting atmospheric 
conditions and source level emissions, as well as population, health baselines, 
incomes, technology, and other factors. 
 This analysis omits certain unquantified effects due to lack of data, time and 
resources.  These unquantified endpoints include other health and ecosystem effects.  
EPA will continue to evaluate new methods and models and select those most 
appropriate for estimating the benefits of reductions in air pollution.  Enhanced 
 1-16 
collaboration between air quality modelers, epidemiologists, toxicologists, ecologists, 
and economists should result in a more tightly integrated analytical framework for 
measuring benefits of air pollution policies. 
 PM2.5 mortality benefits represent a substantial proportion of total monetized benefits 
(over 90%), and these estimates have following key assumptions and uncertainties. 
1. The PM2.5 -related benefits of the alternative scenarios were derived through a benefit 
per-ton approach, which does not fully reflect local variability in population density, 
meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that 
might lead to an over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual benefits of controlling 
SO2. 
2. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 
equally potent in causing premature mortality.  This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 produced via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ 
significantly from direct PM2.5 released from diesel engines and other industrial 
sources, but no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects 
estimates by particle type. 
3. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear within the range 
of ambient concentrations under consideration.  Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM2.5, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations. 
4. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 and premature 
mortality, we include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert 
elicitation study in addition to our core estimates.  Even these multiple 
characterizations omit the uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence 
rates, populations exposed and transferability of the effect estimate to diverse 
locations.  As a result, the reported confidence intervals and range of estimates give 
an incomplete picture about the overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates.  This 
information should be interpreted within the context of the larger uncertainty 
surrounding the entire analysis.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
2.1 Introduction 
 
2.1.1 Background for Proposed Toxics Rule 
 
2.1.2 NESHAP 
This action proposes NESHAP for new and existing coal- and oil-fired electric utility 
steam generating units (EGUs) meeting the definition found in CAA section 112(a)(8).  EPA is 
proposing these standards to meet its statutory obligation to address HAP emissions from these 
sources under CAA section 112(d).  The proposed NESHAP for new and existing coal- and oil-
fired EGUs will be proposed under 40 CFR part 63, subpart UUUUU. 
On December 20, 2000 (65 FR 79825), EPA determined that regulation of coal- and oil-
fired EGUs under CAA section 112 was appropriate and necessary, in accordance with CAA 
section 112(n)(1)(A).  EPA at the same time added coal- and oil-fired EGUs to the list of 
industries requiring regulation under CAA section 112(d).  The December 2000 listing triggered 
the deadline established by Congress in CAA section 112(c)(5) under which EPA has two years 
from the date of listing in which to promulgate ―emissions standards under section (d) of this 
section.‖ 
In 2002, EPA initiated a CAA section 112(d) standard setting process for coal- and oil-
fired EGUs, and on January 30, 2004, proposed CAA section 112(d) standards for mercury (Hg) 
emissions from coal-fired EGUs and nickel (Ni) emissions from oil-fired EGUs, and, in the 
alternative, proposed to remove EGUs from the CAA section 112(c) list based on a finding that it 
was neither appropriate nor necessary to regulate EGUs pursuant to CAA section 112.  EPA 
never finalized the proposed CAA section 112(d) standard.  The removal of EGUs from the CAA 
section 112 list was challenged in the United States (U.S.) Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court).  The Agency finalized the CAA section 111 alternative, 
after taking and responding to extensive public comments on both sets of regulatory options, by 
issuing a de-listing rule (Section 112(n) Revision Rule; 70 FR 15994; March 29, 2005) and a 
final rule (Clean Air Mercury Rule, CAMR) establishing Hg emissions standards for coal-fired 
EGUs under CAA section 111 on May 18, 2005 (70 FR 28606). 
 2-2 
Petitions for reconsideration were filed by a number of parties in summer 2005.  EPA 
responded to the petitions with a final notice of reconsideration on June 9, 2006 (71 FR 33388).  
Petitions for judicial review were filed on November 29, 2006, by Environmental Petitioners; the 
National Congress of American Indians and Treaty Tribes; ARIPPA; American Coal for 
Balanced Mercury Regulations, et al.; United Mine Workers of America; Alaska Industrial 
Development and Export Authority; the States of New Jersey, California, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, 
New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin; and the City of 
Baltimore, MD (State of New Jersey, et al., v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574). 
On February 8, 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court vacated the Section 112(n) Revision Rule 
(State of New Jersey, et al., v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574), and subsequently denied rehearing and 
rehearing en banc of that decision.  As a part of the decision, the D.C. Circuit Court also vacated 
CAMR, reverting to the December 2000 regulatory determination and requiring the development 
of emission standards under CAA section 112(d) (MACT standards) for coal- and oil-fired 
EGUs.  The litigation process continued until, on January 29, 2009, EPA requested of the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) that the Government‘s appeals be withdrawn. 
On December 18, 2008, several environmental and public health organizations 
(―Plaintiffs‖)1 filed a complaint in the D.C. District Court (Civ. No. 1:08-cv-02198 (RMC)) 
alleging that the Agency had failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty under CAA section 
304(a)(2), by failing to promulgate final section 112(d) standards for HAP from coal- and oil-
fired EGUs by the statutorily-mandated deadline, December 20, 2002, 2 years after such sources 
were listed under section 112(c).  EPA settled that litigation.  A Consent Decree was issued on 
April 15, 2010, that calls for EPA to, no later than March 16, 2011, sign for publication in the 
Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth EPA‘s proposed emission 
standards for coal- and oil-fired EGUs and, no later than November 16, 2011, sign for 
publication in the Federal Register a notice of final rulemaking. 
In response to the D.C. Circuit Court‘s vacatur, we are proposing CAA section 112(d) 
NESHAP for all coal- and oil-fired EGUs that reflect the application of the maximum achievable 
control technology (MACT) consistent with the requirements of CAA sections 112(d)(2) and (3).

Council, and Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc.

This proposed rule would protect air quality and promote public health by reducing emissions of 
the hazardous air pollutants (HAP) listed in CAA section 112(b). 
2.1.3 NSPS 
Section 111(b)(1)(b) of the CAA requires EPA to periodically review and revise the new 
source performance standards (NSPS) as necessary to reflect improvements in methods for the 
reducing emissions.  The NSPS for electric utility steam generating units (40 CFR part 60, 
subpart Da) were originally promulgated on June 11, 1979 (44 FR 33580).  On February 27, 
2006, EPA promulgated amendments to the NSPS for particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide 
(SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOX) contained in the standards of performance for electric utility 
steam generating units (71 FR 9866).  EPA was subsequently sued by the offices of multiple 
states attorneys general and environmental organizations on the amendments.  The Petitioners 
alleged that EPA failed to correctly identify the best system of emission reductions for the 
amended SO2 and NOX standards.  The Petitioners also claimed that it is appropriate to establish 
emission limits for fine particulate matter and condensable particulate matter.  Based upon 
further examination of the record, EPA has determined that certain issues in the rule warrant 
further consideration.  On September 4, 2009, EPA was granted a voluntary remand without 
vacatur of the 2006 amendments.  EPA considers it appropriate to respond to the NSPS voluntary 
remand in conjunction with the EGU NESHAP since it allows EPA to present a more 
comprehensive affect on the utility sector.  Therefore, even though we are not under any judicial 
timetable to complete the NSPS remand, we are proposing it in conjunction with the NESHAP.  
We also are proposing several minor amendments, technical clarifications, and corrections to 
existing provisions of the fossil fuel-fired EGU and large and small industrial-commercial-
institutional steam generating units NSPS, 40 CFR part 60, subparts D, Db, and Dc. 
The term ―toxics rule‖ for the remainder of this RIA refers to the combination of the 
EGU NESHAP and NSPS proposals. 
2.2 Appropriate & Necessary Analyses 
In 2000, EPA issued a finding that it was both appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP 
emissions from utilities, in part because Hg, a listed HAP, is both a public health concern and a 
concern in the environment.  This finding was based on the results of the study documented in 
the Utility Study, as well as subsequent analyses and other available information at the time of 
the decision.  The finding that it is appropriate to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-
fired EGUs under CAA section 112 was based on three main points:  1) EGUs are the largest 
domestic source of Hg emissions, 2) Hg in the environment presents significant hazards to public 
 2-4 
health and the environment, and 3) EPA had identified a number of control options which were 
anticipated to effectively reduce HAP emissions from such units.  The finding also noted that 
remaining uncertainties regarding the extent of the public health impact from HAP emissions 
from oil-fired EGUs argued for regulation.  The finding that it is necessary to regulate HAP 
emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs under CAA section 112 was based on the assessment 
that implementation of other requirements under the CAA would not adequately address the 
serious public health and environmental hazards arising from utility HAP emissions which CAA 
section 112 is intended to address. 
Based on the quantitative and qualitative analyses of public health and environmental 
hazards described above, as well as the analyses of emissions and availability of HAP emission 
controls, we find that regulation of HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs under CAA 
section 112 is appropriate and necessary.  The finding that it is appropriate to regulate emissions 
from coal- and oil-fired EGUs under CAA section 112 is confirmed because:  1) Hg continues to 
pose a hazard to public health, 2) U.S. EGU emissions are still the largest domestic source of 
U.S. Hg emissions (by 2016, EPA projects that U.S. EGU Hg emissions are over 6 times larger 
than next largest source, which is iron and steel manufacturing), and 3) effective controls for Hg 
and non-Hg HAP are available for U.S. EGU sources.  In addition, new analyses by EPA show 
that U.S. EGU emissions of non-Hg HAP cause a non-negligible health hazard due to increased 
cancer risk.  The finding that it is necessary to regulate emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs 
under CAA section 112 is confirmed because emissions of Hg and non-Hg HAP causing hazards 
to public health and the environment will not be explicitly addressed by existing or anticipated 
requirements under the CAA. For more information on these findings and the analyses to support 
them, please refer to the preamble or the TSD for the appropriate & necessary analyses. 
2.3 Provisions of the Proposed Toxics Rule 
2.3.1 What Is the Source Category Regulated by the Proposed Toxics Rule? 
The proposed Toxics rule addresses emissions from new and existing coal- and oil-fired 
EGUs.  A major source of HAP emissions is generally a stationary source that emits or has the 
potential to emit 10 tons per year or more of any single HAP or 25 tons per year or more of any 
combination of HAP.  An area source of HAP emissions is a stationary source that is not a major 
source.  CAA section 112(n)(1)(A) makes no distinction between major and area sources of coal- 
and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. 
 2-5 
CAA section 112(a)(8) defines an EGU as: 
a fossil fuel-fired combustion unit of more than 25 megawatts electric (MWe) that 
serves a generator that produces electricity for sale.  A unit that cogenerates steam 
and electricity and supplies more than one-third of its potential electric output 
capacity and more than 25 MWe output to any utility power distribution system 
for sale is also an electric utility steam generating unit. 
This action established 40 CFR part 63, subpart UUUUU, to address HAP emissions 
from new and existing coal- and oil-fired EGUs.  EPA must determine what is the appropriate 
maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for those units under sections 112(d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of the CAA. 
EPA has divided coal- and oil-fired EGUs into the following subcategories: 
 coal-fired units designed for coal > 8,300 Btu/lb; 
 coal-fired units designed for coal < 8,300 Btu/lb; 
 IGCC units; 
 Liquid oil-fired units; and 
 Solid oil-derived fuel-fired units. 
 The EGU NSPS applies to owners/operators of facilities capable of firing more than 
73 megawatts (MW) (250 million Btu per hour(MMBtu/hr)) heat input of fossil fuel 
and that sells more than 25 MW of electric power to a utility power distribution 
system.  The NSPS also apply to industrial-commercial-institutional cogeneration 
units over 250 MMBtu/hr that sell more than 25 MW and more than one-third of their 
potential output capacity to any utility power distribution system. 
2.3.2 What Are the Pollutants Regulated by the Rule? 
The proposed NESHAP regulates emissions of HAP.  Available emissions data show that 
several HAP, which are formed during the combustion process or which are contained within the 
fuel burned, are emitted from coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units.  The 
individual HAPs include mercury, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and nickel, among others.  EPA 
described the health effects of these HAP and other HAP emitted from the operation of coal- and 
oil-fired electric utility steam generating units in the preamble to the proposed rule.  These HAP 
 2-6 
emissions are known to cause, or contribute significantly to air pollution, which may reasonably 
be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. 
In addition to reducing HAP, the emission control technologies that will be installed on 
coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units to reduce HAP will also reduce sulfur 
dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter (PM). 
The proposed NSPS amendments would revise the PM, SO2, and NOX standards.  A wide 
range of human health and welfare effects are linked to the emissions of PM, SO2, and NOX. 
These human health and welfare effects are discussed extensively in Chapter 6 of this RIA. 
2.3.3 What Are the Proposed Requirements? 
The numerical emission standards that are being proposed for existing coal- and oil-fired 
electric utility steam generating units are shown in Tables 2-1 and 2-2.

We analyzed a beyond-the-floor standard for Hg of only 4 lbs/trillion BTUs for all 
existing and new ―coal-fired units designed for coal < 8,300 Btu/lb‖ based on the availability of 
activated carbon injection (ACI) for cost-effective Hg control. Most of these units burn lignite 
coal.  We are proposing a beyond-the-floor standard for these units because the Agency 
considers the cost of incremental reductions beyond the MACT floor standard of 11 lbs/trillion 
BTUs to be reasonable.  While the primary IPM analysis discussed in Chapter 8 included a 
beyond-the-floor limit, EPA performed a supplemental analysis that estimates the difference in 
impacts between regulating coal-fired units designed for coal <8,300 Btu/lb at the floor limit and 
at the beyond-the-floor limit modeled.  This analysis (the IPM Beyond the Floor Cost TSD) 
shows that if the units were only required to meet a standard of 11 lbs/trillion BTUs, the units 
 2-9 
would emit approximately an additional 3,854 lbs at a reduced annualized cost of $86.7 million. 
EPA also performed an alternative analysis which can be found in the Beyond the MACT Floor 
Analysis TSD. 
The proposed NSPS standards are shown in Table 2-5. 
Table 2-5. NSPS Emission Standards 
Pollutant Existing Standard Proposed Standard 
PM 0.015 lb/MMBtu (filterable PM) 0.026 lb/MMBtu (total PM) 
SO2 1.4 lb/MWh or 95% reduction 1.0 lb/MWh or 97% Reduction 
NOX 1.0 lb/MWh 0.70 lb/MWh (option 1) 
Combined NOX + CO Standard 
(option 2)  
 
The EGU NESHAP PM and SO2 standards for new facilities are as stringent or more 
stringent than the proposed NSPS amendments so we have concluded that there are no costs or 
benefits associated with these amendments.  Thus, the only impacts associated with these 
amendments are those for the NOx emissions limits for new facilities. 
2.3.4 What Are the Operating Limitations? 
Instead of emission limitations for the organic HAP, we are proposing that owners or 
operators of EGUs submit to the delegated authority or EPA, as appropriate, if requested, 
documentation that an annual performance test meeting the requirements of the proposed rule 
was conducted.  We are proposing that, to comply with the work practice standard, an annual 
performance test procedure include the following: 
(1)  Inspect the burner, and clean or replace any components of the burner as necessary, 
(2)  Inspect the flame pattern and make any adjustments to the burner necessary to 
optimize the flame pattern consistent with the manufacturer‘s specifications, 
(3)  Inspect the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio, and ensure that it is correctly 
calibrated and functioning properly, 
(4)  Minimize total emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) consistent with the 
manufacturer‘s specifications, 
(5)  Measure the concentration in the effluent stream of CO in parts per million, dry 
volume basis (ppmvd), before and after the adjustments are made, 
 2-10 
(6)  Submit an annual report containing the concentrations of CO in the effluent stream in 
ppmvd, and oxygen in percent dry basis, measured before and after the adjustments of 
the EGU, a description of any corrective actions taken as a part of the combustion 
adjustment, and the type and amount of fuel used over the 12 months prior to the 
annual adjustment. 
2.4 Startup, Shutdown, and Malfunction 
In proposing the standards in this NESHAP, EPA has taken into account startup and 
shutdown periods and, for the reasons explained below, has not proposed different standards for 
those periods.  The standards that we are proposing are daily or monthly averages.  Continuous 
emission monitoring data obtained from best performing units, and used in establishing the 
standards, include periods of startup and shutdown.  EGUs, especially solid fuel-fired EGUs, do 
not normally startup and shutdown more than once per day.  Thus, we are not establishing a 
separate emission standard for these periods because startup and shutdown are part of their 
routine operations and, therefore, are already addressed by the standards.  Periods of startup, 
normal operations, and shutdown are all predictable and routine aspects of a source‘s operation.  
We have evaluated whether it is appropriate to have the same standards apply during startup and 
shutdown as applied to normal operations. 
Periods of startup, normal operations, and shutdown are all predictable and routine 
aspects of a source‘s operations.  However, by contrast, malfunction is defined as a ―sudden, 
infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control and monitoring 
equipment, process equipment or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner...‖ (40 CFR 
63.2)  EPA has determined that malfunctions should not be viewed as a distinct operating mode 
and, therefore, any emissions that occur at such times do not need to be factored into 
development of CAA section 112(d) standards, which, once promulgated, apply at all times. 
The existing PM, SO2, and NOX NSPS exclude periods of startup and shutdown.  The 
proposed PM, SO2, and NOX standards would include periods of startup and shutdown.  Periods 
of malfunction for the PM and NOX standards and periods of emergency condition for the SO2 
standard are presently excluded from the emissions standards and would continue to be excluded. 
2.5 Baseline and Years of Analysis 
The Agency considered all promulgated CAA requirements, known state actions, and 
NSR/PSD enforcement actions in the baseline used to develop the estimates of benefits and costs 
for the proposed Toxics rule.  EPA did not consider actions states may take in the future to 
 2-11 
implement the existing ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS standards in the baseline for this analysis.  The 
year 2016 is the compliance year for the proposed Toxics rule, though as we explain in Chapters 
5,6,8 and 9 we use 2015 as a proxy for compliance in 2016 for our benefits and economic impact 
analysis due to availability of modeling impacts in that year.  All estimates presented in this 
report represent annualized estimates of the benefits and costs of the proposed Toxics Rule in 
2016 rather than the net present value of a stream of benefits and costs in these particular years 
of analysis. 
2.6 Benefits of Emission Controls 
The benefits of the proposed Toxics Rule are discussed in Chapter 5 of this report.  
Annual monetized benefits of $58 to 140 billion (3 percent discount rate) or $52 to 130 billion 
(7 percent discount rate) are expected for the proposed Toxics rule in 2016. 
2.7 Cost of Emission Controls 
EPA analyzed the costs of the proposed Toxics Rule using the Integrated Planning Model 
(IPM).  EPA has used this model in the past to analyze the impacts of regulations on the power 
sector and used an earlier version of this model to analyze the impacts of the CAIR rule and 
proposed Transport Rule.  EPA estimates the private industry annual compliance costs of the rule 
to the power sector to be $10.9 billion in 2015 (2007 dollars).  In estimating the net benefits 
(benefits – costs) of the rule, EPA uses social costs of the rule that represent the costs to society 
of this rule.  The social costs of the rule are estimated to be $ 10.9 billion (2007 dollars) in 2015.  
A description of the methodology used to model the costs and economic impacts to the power 
sector is discussed in Chapter 8 of this report. A description of how the social costs and 
employment impacts associated with this proposed rule are estimated is provided in Chapter 9 of 
this report. 
2.8 Organization of the Regulatory Impact Analysis

Chapter 3  
EMISSIONS IMPACTS 
This chapter summarizes the emissions inventories that are used to create emissions 
inputs to the air quality modeling that is described in Chapter 4. This chapter provides a 
summary of the baseline emissions inventories and the emissions reductions that were modeled 
for this rule. The emissions inventories are processed into a form that is required by the 
Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which simulates the numerous physical and 
chemical processes involved in the formation, transport, and destruction of ozone, particulate 
matter (PM) and air toxics.  As part of the analysis for this rulemaking, the CMAQ was used to 
calculate daily and annual particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5) 
concentrations, 8-hr maximum ozone, annual total mercury (Hg) deposition levels and visibility 
impairment. In the remainder of this Chapter we provide an overview of (1) the emissions 
components of the modeling platform, (2) the development of the 2005 base-year emissions, (3) 
the development of  the 2016 future-year base case emissions, and (4) the development of the 
2016 future year-control case (policy case) emissions. It should be noted that the projected future 
year inventory used for this analysis is generally representative of several years around 2016 
such as 2015. 
3.1 Overview of Modeling Platform and Emissions Processing Performed 
The inputs to the air quality model; including emissions, meteorology, initial conditions, 
boundary conditions; along with the methods used to produce the inputs and the configuration of 
the air quality model are collectively known as a ‗modeling platform‘.  The 2005-based air 
quality modeling platform used for the proposed Toxics Rule includes 2005 base-year emissions 
and 2005 meteorology for modeling ozone, PM2.5 and mercury (Hg) with CMAQ.  Version 4.1 
of the 2005-based platform (2005 v4.1 platform) was used for the proposed Toxics Rule, and it is 
described in the 2005-based, v4.1 platform document: ―Technical Support Document:  
Preparation of Emissions Inventories for the Version 4.1, 2005-based Platform‖, posted at 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/. The Emission Inventories Technical Support Document for 
the Proposed Toxics Rule entitled ―Technical Support Document (TSD) For the Proposed Toxics 
Rule, Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2009-0234‖, posted at the same site, describes the 
development of the future year inventories. It provides more detail on (1) the development of the 
2016 base-case emissions inventories for all sectors and (2) the procedures followed to create 
emissions inputs to CMAQ. Details on the non-emissions portion of the modeling platform used 
for the RIA are provided in Chapter 4. 
 3-2 
Emissions estimates were made for a 2005 base year and for the 2016 future-year 
scenarios.  All inventories include emissions from EGUs, non-EGU point sources, stationary 
nonpoint sources (previously referred to as stationary area sources), onroad mobile sources, 
nonroad mobile sources and natural, biogenic emissions.  Mercury emissions from volcanic 
sources, and land and ocean direct and recycled emissions are also included. For each of the 
modeling scenarios conducted: 2005 base year, 2016 base case, and 2016 control case, the 
emissions inventory files were processed using the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions 
(SMOKE) Modeling System version 2.6 to produce the gridded model-ready emissions for input 
to CMAQ.  SMOKE was used to create the hourly, gridded emissions data for the species 
required by CMAQ species to perform air quality modeling for all sectors, including biogenic 
emissions. 
In support of this proposal, EPA processed the emissions in support of air quality 
modeling for two domains, covering the East and the West (2 separate model runs) of the U.S. 
and parts of Canada and Mexico using a horizontal grid resolution of 12 x 12 kilometers (km).  
These 12 km modeling domains were ―nested‖ within a modeling domain covering the lower 48 
states using a grid resolution of 36 x 36 km.1 
3.2 Development of 2005 Base Year Emissions 
Emissions inventory inputs representing the year 2005 were developed to provide a base 
year for forecasting future air quality. These inventories include criteria air pollutants, hydrogen 
chloride (HCl), chlorine (CL2) and mercury.
2 Additionally, for some sectors, benzene, 
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and methanol are used from the inventory for chemical speciation of 
volatile organic compounds (VOC). The emission source sectors and the basis for current and 
future-year inventories are listed and defined in Table 3-1. These are the same sectors as were 
used in the 2005-based version 4 (v4) platform (www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html#2005), 
which was the starting point for the v4.1 platform. A comparison of these two platforms is 
provided in the 2005-based, v4.1 platform document described earlier. The starting point for both 
platforms was the 2005 National Emission Inventory (NEI), version 2 (v2) from October 6, 2008 
(http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2005inventory.html).  The v4.1 platform utilizes the same 
2006 Canadian inventory and a 1999 Mexican inventory as were used in the v4 platform; these 
                                                 
1
 The air quality predictions from the 36 km Continental US (CONUS) domain were used to provide incoming 
―boundary‖ concentrations for the 12 km domains. 
2 
The mercury emissions used in the version 4.1 platform include changes to the version 4 platform 2005 Hg 
emissions.  These changes were made in support of the analyses for this rule and for the NESHAP for Industrial, 
Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters (Boiler MACT).  These changes are provided in more 
detail in this section.

were the latest available data from these countries and were used for the portions of Canada and 
Mexico within the modeling domains.

NATA inventory is an update to the 2005 NEI v2 and was divided into EGU and 
non-EGU sectors consistent with the other pollutants.  We additionally removed 
Hg from sources from the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants for Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers and Process 
Heaters (aka ―Boiler MACT‖) Information Collection Request (ICR) database 
because we included these emissions in the non-EGU sector.

The onroad emissions were primarily based on the 12/21/2009 version of the Motor 
Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES2010) (http://www.epa.gov/otaq/models/moves/).  
MOVES was run with a State/month aggregation using average fuels for each state, state/month-
average temperatures, and national default vehicle age distributions.  The MOVES data were 
allocated to counties using state-county distributions from the 2005 National Mobile Inventory 
model (NMIM) results that are part of the 2005 NEI v2.  MOVES2010 was used for onroad 
 3-6 
sources other than in California1 for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), VOC, PM2.5, 
particulate matter less than ten microns (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), 
naphthalene,2 and some VOC HAPs.3 Since MOVES2010 does not provide emissions for all 
HAPs, the 2005 NEI v2 values, which came from NMIM other than for California, were used for 
those HAPs not provided by MOVES.  Mercury was the only of these NMIM-based HAPs that 
was used in the modeling.  To account for the temperature dependence of PM2.5, MOVES-based 
temperature adjustment factors were applied to gridded, hourly emissions using the same 2005 
gridded, hourly 2 meter temperature data used in CMAQ.  Additional information on this 
approach is available in the 2005-based v4.1 platform documentation. 
The nonroad emissions utilized the NMIM model (other than California
2
) to create 
county/month emissions, which are consistent with the annual emissions from the 2005 NEI v2. 
Emissions from the point source NEI were primarily from the 2005 NEI v2 inventory, 
which consisted primarily 2005 values with some 2002 emissions values where 2005 was not 
available.  The point sources are split into ―EGU‖ (aka ―ptipm‖)  or ―Non-EGU‖ (aka 
―ptnonipm‖) sectors for modeling purposes, based on the matching of the  unit level data in the 
NEI units in the National Electric Energy Database System (NEEDS) version 4.10 database.  All 
units that matched NEEDS were included in the EGU sector so that the future year emissions, 
which are generated by the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) based on the NEEDS units, would 
have a consistent universe for the existing sources.  We made updates to the 2005 NEI data to 
remove duplicates and plants or units that were found to shutdown prior to 2005, add estimates 
for ethanol plants, and revise some of the 2002 data to reflect 2005 emissions based on controls 
that were discovered to have been put in place between 2002 and 2005. 
The mercury emissions used in the modeling were from the inventory developed for the 
2005 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), with the exceptions that (1) we replaced Hg 
emissions for boilers and process heaters with the emissions from the database developed as part 
of the Boiler MACT, which contained unit-specific Hg emissions, (2) we modified some gold 
mine mercury estimates, and geographic coordinates and stack parameters to account for newer 
data collected as part of the Gold Mine Ore Processing and Production NESHAP, and (3) we 
removed Hg from plants that were found to have closed prior to 2005.  The NATA inventory 
started with the 2005 NEI v2, and was updated with data collected for some source categories 
                                                 
1
 California onroad emissions were taken from the California Air Resources Board submission of 2005 data to the 
NEI.  The inventory included all criteria air pollutants other than ammonia and hazardous air pollutants. 
2 
Naphthalene emissions were not used in the modeling 
3 
1,3 Butadiene, Acrolein, Formaldehyde, Benzene and Acetaldehyde.  Of these, the latter 3 are used in the modeling 
 3-7 
during the rule development process, which resulted in major updates to mercury emissions for 
Portland cement and hazardous waste combustion.  The NATA inventory was also revised as a 
result of comments received as part of the state, local and tribal review.  The NATA Hg 
emissions were also split into the ―EGU‖ and ―Non-EGU‖ sectors for use in the 2005v4.1 
platform. 
The 2005 annual NOX and SO2 emissions for sources in the EGU sector as defined in 
Table 3-1 are based primarily on data from EPA‘s Clean Air Markets Division‘s Continuous 
Emissions Monitoring (CEM) program, with other pollutants estimated using emission factors 
and the CEM annual heat input.  For mercury, these emission factors were based on the 2002 
emissions divided by the 2002 heat input.  This approach retained the speciated mercury 
emissions, which had been generated for 2002 using the same speciation approach as was used 
for the future year emissions, whereby speciated factors were applied to units based on coal rank, 
firing type, boiler/burner type, and post-combustion emissions controls. For EGUs without 
CEMs, emissions were obtained from the state-submitted data in the NEI.  Revisions to this 
sector between version 4 and 4.1 involved the revision and addition of ORIS plant and unit 
codes,1 and for a subset of these units, annual emissions were recomputed2 to reflect the newly 
matched CEM data. 
For the 2005 base year, the annual EGU NEI emissions in the NEI were allocated to 
hourly emissions values needed for modeling based on the 2004, 2005, and 2006 CEM data.  The 
NOX CEM data were used to create NOX-specific profiles, the SO2 data were used to create SO2-
specific profiles, and the heat input data were used to allocate all other pollutants.  The three 
years of data were used to create monthly profiles by state, while the 2005 data were used to 
create state-averaged profiles for allocating monthly emissions to daily.  These daily values were 
input into SMOKE, which utilized state-averaged 2005-based hourly profiles to allocate to 
hourly values. This approach to temporal allocation was used for all base and control cases 
modeled to provide a temporal consistency that is intended to be a conceivable temporal 
allocation without tying the approach to a single year. 
The nonpoint inventory was augmented with updated oil and gas exploration emissions 
from Texas and Oklahoma (CO, NOX, PM, SO2, VOC).  These oil and gas exploration emissions 
were in addition to data added to the 2005 v4 platform that includes emissions within the

 An Oris code is a 4 digit number assigned by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) at the U.S. Department 
of Energy that is used to track emission generating units under numerous other data systems including the Clean 
Air Markets Divisions CEM data.

 Net change was a decrease in NOX by 1700 tons and a decrease in SO2 by 600 tons. 
 3-8 
following states: Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, 
South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. 
The commercial marine category 3 (C3) vessel emissions (seca_c3 sector) used updated 
gridded 2005 emissions to reflect the final projections from 2002 developed for the category 3 
commercial marine Emissions Control Area (ECA) proposal to the International Maritime 
Organization (EPA-420-F-10-041, August 2010).  These updated emissions include Canada as 
part of the ECA, and were updated using region-specific growth rates; thus the v4.1 seca_c3 
sector inventories contain Canadian province codes. 
Other emissions sources included the average-year county-based inventories for 
emissions from wildfires and prescribed burning.  These emissions are intended to be 
representative for both base and future years and are held constant for each, which minimizes 
their impact on the modeling results because of post-processing techniques.  For Hg, we also 
used emissions of elemental mercury from natural, recycled and volcanic sources.  The same 
approach was used in the v4 platform except that in the v4.1 platform, we reduced emissions of 
the natural emissions from land by 90% based on literature1 indicating that the emissions are 10-
12 tons per year as opposed to the 120 tons we had been using previously. 
Additionally, the inventories were processed to provide the hourly, gridded emissions for 
the model-species needed by CMAQ.  All of these details are further described in the 2005-based 
v4.1 platform documentation.  Table 3-2 provides summaries of emissions by sector for the 2005 
base year, for the v4.1 platform used for the modeling this rule.

 fdust emissions in this table and all other summaries  represent the emissions after application of the  transportable fraction, which was applied to reduce emissions to 
reflect observed diminished transport from these sources at the scale of our modeling.  Application of the transport fraction prevents the overestimation of fugitive dust 
impacts in the grid modeling as compared to ambient samples. 
* due to uncertainty in mercury emissions from this sector, they were removed from the inventories and not used.  The amount removed was on the order of 0.001 tons 
total mercury for U.S. and non-U.S. components of the seca_c3 sector. 
 
 3-10 
Tables 3-3 through 3-5 provide state-level summaries for Hg, SO2, and PM2.5.  In the tables 
below, ―Nonpoint‖ represents the nonpt sector; ―Area Fugitive Dust‖ (which contains only PM10 
and PM2.5) represents the afdust sector; on_noadj, on_startpm and on_runpm sectors are summed 
into ―Onroad‖; and nonroad, alm_no_c3 (locomotives and category 1 and 2 marine vessels) and 
seca_c3 (category 3 marine vessels) sectors are summed into ―Nonroad.‖  Mercury emissions are 
excluded from fires in both the base and future years due to uncertainty associated with these 
emissions.

3.3 Development of Future Year Base Case Emissions 
The 2016 base case scenario represents predicted emissions including known Federal 
measures for all sectors.  It reflects projected economic changes and fuel usage for the EGU and 
mobile sectors.  Emissions from non-EGU stationary sectors have previously been shown to not be 
well correlated with economic forecasts, and therefore economic impacts were not included for 
non-EGU stationary sources. Like the 2005 base case, this emissions case includes criteria 
pollutants, mercury, hydrogen chloride, and chlorine from non-EGU sources, and, for some 
sectors benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and methanol from the inventory is used in VOC 
speciation.  It does not include metals nor other non-mercury HAPs except for those mentioned 
above. 
The 2016 base case EGU emissions projections of mercury, hydrogen chloride, SO2, and 
PM were obtained from an interim version 4.10 of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) 
(http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-ipm/index.html).  The IPM is a multiregional, 
dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector.  Version 4.10 
reflects state rules and consent decrees through December 1, 2010, and incorporates information 
on existing controls collected through the Information Collection Request (ICR) for the proposed 
Toxics Rule.  Units with SO2 or NOX advanced controls (e.g., scrubber, SCR) that were not 
required to run for compliance with Title IV, New Source Review (NSR), state settlements, or 
state-specific rules were modeled by IPM to either operate those controls or not based on 
economic efficiency parameters.  Units with advanced mercury controls (e.g., ACI) were assumed 
to operate those controls in states with mercury requirements.  Note that this base case includes the 
proposed Transport Rule, which will be finalized in June, 2011.  Speciated emissions were 
estimated using mercury speciation factors, which are assigned based on coal rank, firing type, 
boiler/burner type, and post-combustion emissions controls.  These are the same factors as were 
used in the Clean Air Mercury rule and are provided in Appendix A.  Further details on the EGU 
emissions inventory used for this proposal can be found in the IPM Documentation. 
The length of time required to conduct emissions and photochemical modeling precluded 
the use of the final version IPM version 4.10.  Thus the air quality modeling for the proposed 
Toxics Rule relied on electric generating unit (EGU) emission projections from an interim IPM 
platform that was subsequently updated during the rulemaking process for the proposed Toxics 
Rule policy analysis.  The updated emissions were not included in the air quality modeling.  The 
updated baseline emission projection was based on an updated IPM platform, which resulted in 
emissions changes to the EGU sector only.  The IPM update reflects additional information 
obtained primarily from the 2010 ICR and from comments submitted on an IPM Notice of Data 
 3-15 
Availability (NODA) in October 2010.  Notably, this IPM update included the addition of over 20 
GW of existing ACI reported to EPA via the ICR, which explains the majority of the difference in 
interim and final base case EGU mercury projections.  This update also includes additional unit-
level updates that were made based on the ICR and public comments on the IPM NODA which 
identified additional existing pollution controls (such as scrubbers).  Additionally, this update 
corrected an erroneous natural gas emission factor which was responsible for an over-prediction in 
PM2.5 emissions from the EGU sector of 85 thousand tons.  Other updates includes adjustments to 
assumptions regarding the performance of acid gas control technologies, new costs imposed on 
fuel-switching (e.g., bituminous to sub-bituminous), correction of lignite availability to some 
plants, incorporation of additional planned retirements, a more inclusive implementation of the 
scrubber upgrade option, and the availability of a scrubber retrofit to waste-coal fired fluidized bed 
combustion units without an existing scrubber.  Further details on the future year EGU emissions 
inventory used for this proposal can be found in the IPM v.4.10 Documentation, available at 
http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-ipm/index.html. 
Prior to emissions processing through SMOKE, the IPM results were adjusted to account 
for the impact of the Boiler MACT which resulted in a reduction of roughly 20,000 tons of SO2 
and 460 tons of HCL.  This adjustment was not applied to the final IPM version. Mobile source 
inventories of onroad and nonroad mobile emissions were created for 2016 using a combination of 
the NMIM and MOVES models in a consistent approach with the 2005 base year.  As with the 
2005 emissions, the 2016 onroad emissions were based on MOVES 2010.  Future-year vehicle 
miles travelled (VMT) were projected from the 2005 NEI v2 VMT using growth rates from the 
2009 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) data.  The same MOVES-based PM2.5 temperature 
adjustment factors were also applied as in 2005 for running mode emissions because these are not 
dependent on year; however, cold start emissions used 2015-specific temperature adjustment 
factors. 
The 2016 onroad emissions reflect control program implementation through 2016 and 
include the Light-Duty Vehicle Tier 2 Rule, the Onroad Heavy-Duty Rule, and the Mobile Source 
Air Toxics (MSAT) final rule.  Emission reductions and increases from the Renewable Fuel 
Standard version 2 (RFS2) are not included. 
Nonroad mobile emissions were created only with NMIM using a consistent approach as 
was used for 2005, but emissions were calculated using NMIM future-year equipment population 
estimates and control programs for 2015 and then adjusted to 2016 using national level factors.  
Emissions for locomotives and category 1 and 2 (C1 and C2) commercial marine vessels were 
 3-16 
derived for 2016 based on emissions published in the Locomotive Marine Rule, Regulatory 
Impact Assessment, Chapter 3 (see http://www.epa.gov/otaq/locomotives.htm#2008final). 
The future baseline case nonroad mobile emissions reductions for these years include 
reductions to locomotives, various nonroad engines including diesel engines and various marine 
engine types, fuel sulfur content, and evaporative emissions standards, including the  category 3 
marine diesel engines and International Maritime Organization standards which include the 
establishment of emission control areas for these ships.  A summary of the mobile source control 
programs included in the projected future year baseline is shown in Table 3-6.

In the 2016 base case, we used the 2005 base year emissions for Canada and Mexico 
because appropriate future-year emissions for sources in these countries were not available.  The 
 3-17 
future-year emissions need to reflect expected percent reductions or increases between the base 
year and the future year to be considered appropriate for this type of modeling. 
For non-EGU point sources, emissions were projected by including emissions reductions 
and increases from a variety of source data.11  For non-EGU point sources, other than for certain 
large municipal waste combustors and airports, emissions were not grown using economic growth 
projections, but rather were held constant at the emissions levels in 2005.  Emissions reductions 
were applied to non-EGU point source to reflect final federal measures, known plant closures, 
refinery and other consent decrees. The starting point was the emission projections done for the 
2005v4 platform for the proposed Transport Rule.  The 2014 projection factors developed for the 
Transport Rule proposal (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html#transport) were 
updated for  these 2016 baseline projections.  Several additional NESHAP were promulgated since 
emission projections were done for the proposed Transport Rule, and these were included for the 
2016 base case.  Emission reductions were also applied to include the impact of the Boiler MACT, 
which had been proposed at the time of the analysis, and finalized in February 2011.  This 
approach, which utilized information developed between the proposed and final rule, resulted in 
the reduction of roughly 400,000 tons of SO2, 5,600 tons HCL and 1.8 tons of Hg nationwide. In 
addition, the projection includes local controls for NOX and VOC from the New York State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) as part of another effort; we do not anticipate that this change 
significantly impacts the results of this RIA, which are primarily resulting from changes to SO2 
and PM2.5. 
Since aircraft at airports were treated as point emissions sources in the 2005 NEI v2, we 
applied projection factors based on activity growth projected by the Federal Aviation 
Administration Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) system, published December 2008 for these 
sources. 
The mercury emission projections included NESHAP for non-EGU source categories that 
were finalized or expected to be finalized prior to the proposed Toxics rule including the Boiler 
MACT (1.8 tons reduction), Portland Cement NESHAP (6.4 tons reduction), Gold Mines 
NESHAP (1.8 tons reduction), Electric Arc Furnaces NESHAP (2.4 tons reduction), Mercury Cell 
Chlor-Alkali NESHAP (2.8 tons reduction) and Hazardous Waste Combustion NESHAP (1.1 ton

 Controls from the NOX SIP call were assumed to have been in place by 2005 and captured in the 2005 NEI v2. 
 3-18 
reduction12) In addition, the projections included reduction of Hg emissions due to the replacement 
of a smelter with a recovery boiler at a pulp and paper plant (0.7 tons reduction). 
Emissions from stationary nonpoint sources were projected using procedures specific to 
individual source categories.  Refueling emissions were projected using the refueling results from 
the NMIM runs performed for the onroad mobile sector.  Portable fuel container emissions were 
projected using estimates from previous rulemaking inventories compiled by the Office of 
Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ).  Emissions of ammonia and dust from animal operations 
were projected based on animal population data from the Department of Agriculture and EPA.  
Residential wood combustion was projected by replacement of obsolete woodstoves with new 
woodstoves and a 1 percent annual increase in fireplaces.  Landfill emissions were projected using 
MACT controls.  In addition, many of the NY SIP controls applied to nonpoint categories and 
were included in the projection.  All other nonpoint sources were held constant between 2005 and 
the 2016 future year scenarios. 
A summary of all rules and growth assumptions impacting non-EGU stationary sources is 
provided in Table 3-7.  The table is broken out into two sections:  (1) the approaches used to 
project emissions  for the proposed Transport Rule that were carried forward for the proposed 
Toxics Rule and (2) the added controls/reductions used for the proposed Toxics rule that had not 
been used for the proposed Transport rule.

1. They were changed to reflect a 2016 future year, rather than 2012 / 2014 
2. We inadvertently did not apply closures that had been applied for the Transport Rule proposal; emissions 
from these plants sum to  3300 tons VOC, 178 tons PM2.5, 1982 tons SO2, 1639 tons NOX, 6 tons NH3 
and 379 tons CO.  At the state level, the largest impact is in West Virginia (717 tons NOX, which is 2% of 
emissions in ptnonipm) and 1604 tons SO2 which is 7% of the ptnonipm sector.  When considering 
emissions from other sectors, the percentages will be much smaller.  All other errors are under 500 tons ( 
less than 1% of the ptnonipm sector).  This omission is expected to have negligible impacts on our analysis 
since the reductions were omitted from both the base and policy cases. 
3. Note that SO2 reductions are expected to occur to due fuel sulfur limits but were excluded from the 
projection.  They were expected to reduce SO2 by 27,000 tons, nationwide.  This omission is expected to 
have negligible impacts on our analysis since the reductions were omitted from both the base and policy 
cases. 
4.  Due to a software issue, emission reductions from the LaFarge and SaintGobain consent decrees (January 
2010) were not included in the projection.  The resulting emissions are therefore too high in CA, IL, IN, 
KS, LA, MA, MI, MO, NC, OH, OK, PA, TX, WA, and WI, and are summarized nationally below.  
Although these missed reductions are large, they have a minimal impact on our overall analysis because the 
modeling analysis for the RIA captures an appropriate difference between the future base and policy cases 
and that difference is unaffected by this omission since it was omitted from both the base and the policy 
cases.

3.4 Development of Future Year Control Case Emissions for Air Quality Modeling 
For the future year control case (policy case) air quality modeling, the emissions for all 
sectors were unchanged from the base case modeling except for those from EGUs.  The IPM 
model was used to prepare the 2016 policy case (i.e., the proposed Toxics Rule) for EGU 
emissions as described in the IPM v.4.10 Documentation, available at 
http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-ipm/index.html. As with the base case projections, 
photochemical modeling of the policy case is based on interim IPM v.4.10.  The final IPM 4.10 
includes all of the updates incorporated in the base case.  In addition, the mercury removal from 
some new fabric filters is correctly accounted for in this update.  The policy modeled in this final 
scenario reflects the emissions limits that EPA is proposing.  This differs from interim policy case 
modeling, which was conducted before a comprehensive review of ICR data was able to inform 
the proposed emissions limits.  Using limited ICR data available early in the rulemaking process, 
 3-25 
EPA‘s preliminary policy case reflected lower HCL and mercury emissions standards than are 
being proposed today.  The changes in EGU Hg, SO2, and PM2.5 emissions as a result of the 
interim policy case (utilized in the air quality modeling) for the lower 48 states are summarized in 
Table 3-12. State-specific summaries of EGU Hg, SO2 and PM2.5 for the sum of the lower 48 
states are shown in Tables 3-13 through 3-15, respectively.

AIR QUALITY BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
4.1 Air Quality Modeling Platform 
This section describes the air quality modeling performed by EPA in support of the 
Toxics Rule. A national scale air quality modeling analysis was performed to estimate the impact 
of the sector emissions changes on future year annual and 24-hour PM2.5 concentrations, 8-hr 
maximum ozone, total mercury deposition, as well as visibility impairment. Air quality benefits 
are estimated with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. CMAQ simulates 
the numerous physical and chemical processes involved in the formation, transport, and 
destruction of ozone, particulate matter and air toxics.  In addition to the CMAQ model, the 
modeling platform includes the emissions, meteorology, and initial and boundary condition data 
which are inputs to this model. 
Emissions and air quality modeling decisions are made early in the analytical process.  
For this reason, it is important to note that the inventories used in the air quality modeling and 
the benefits modeling may be slightly different than the final utility sector inventory. Similarly, 
the projected future year inventory used for this analysis is generally representative of several 
years around 2016 such as 2015. However, the air quality inventories and the final rule 
inventories are generally consistent, so the air quality modeling adequately reflects the effects of 
the rule. Photochemical grid models use state of the science numerical algorithms to estimate 
pollutant formation, transport, and deposition over a variety of spatial scales that range from 
urban to continental. Emissions of precursor species are injected into the model where they react 
to form secondary species such as ozone and then transport around the modeling domain before 
ultimately being removed by deposition or chemical reaction. 
The 2005-based CMAQ modeling platform was used as the basis for the air quality 
modeling for this rule.  This platform represents a structured system of connected modeling-
related tools and data that provide a consistent and transparent basis for assessing the air quality 
response to projected changes in emissions.  The base year of data used to construct this platform 
includes emissions and meteorology for 2005. The platform is intended to support a variety of 
regulatory and research model applications and analyses. More information about the modeling 
platform is available in the modeling technical support document for this rule (USEPA, 2011). 
4.1.1 Photochemical Model Background 
The Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model v4.7.1 (www.cmaq-model.org) 
is a state of the science three-dimensional Eularian ―one-atmosphere‖ photochemical transport 
 4-2 
model  used to estimate air quality (Appel et al., 2008; Appel et al., 2007; Byun and Schere, 
2006). CMAQ simulates the formation and fate of photochemical oxidants, ozone, primary and 
secondary PM concentrations, and air toxics over regional and urban spatial scales for given 
input sets of meteorological conditions and emissions. CMAQ is applied with the AERO5 
aerosol module, which includes the ISORROPIA inorganic chemistry (Nenes et al., 1998) and a 
secondary organic aerosol module (Carlton et al., 2010). The CMAQ model is applied with 
sulfur and organic oxidation aqueous phase chemistry (Carlton et al., 2008) and the carbon-bond 
2005 (CB05) gas-phase chemistry module (Gery et al., 1989). 
4.1.2 Model Setup, Application, and Post-Processing 
The modeling analyses were performed for a domain covering the continental United 
States, as shown in Figure 4.1.  This domain has a parent horizontal grid of 36 km with two 
finer-scale 12 km grids over portions of the eastern and western U.S.  The model extends 
vertically from the surface to 100 millibars (approximately 15 km) using a sigma-pressure 
coordinate system.  Air quality conditions at the outer boundary of the 36 km domain were taken 
from a global model and vary in time and space. The 36 km grid was only used to establish the 
incoming air quality concentrations along the boundaries of the 12 km grids.  Only the finer grid 
data were used in determining the impacts of the emissions changes. Table 4.1 provides 
geographic information about the photochemical model domains.

36 km national modeling domain; the red inner box is the 12 km western U.S. grid; and the 
blue inner box is the 12 km eastern U.S. grid. 
 
The 36 km and 12 km modeling domains were modeled for the entire year of 2005 and 
projected year 2016. Data from the entire year were utilized when looking at the estimation of 
PM2.5, total mercury deposition, and visibility impacts from the regulation. Data from April 
through October is used to estimate ozone impacts. All air quality impacts are based on 
improvements in future year pollution based on emissions changes from this source sector. 
As part of the analysis for this rulemaking, the modeling system was used to calculate 
daily and annual PM2.5 concentrations, 8-hr maximum ozone, annual total mercury deposition 
levels and visibility impairment. Model predictions are used to estimate future-year design 
values of PM2.5 and ozone.  Specifically, we compare a 2016 baseline scenario, a scenario 
without the boiler sector controls, to a 2016 control scenario which includes the adjustments to 
the boiler sector.  This is done by calculating the simulated air quality ratios between any 
particular future year simulation and the 2005 base. 
These predicted ratios are then applied to ambient base year design values.  The design 
value projection methodology used here followed EPA guidance for such analyses (USEPA, 
2007).  Additionally, the raw model outputs are also used in a relative sense as inputs to the 
health and welfare impact functions of the benefits analysis.  Only model predictions for mercury 
deposition were analyzed using absolute model changes, although percent changes between the 
control case and two future baselines are also estimated.

4.1.3 Emissions Input Data 
The emissions data used in the base year and future baseline and future emissions 
adjustment case are based on the 2005 v4.1 platform. The emissions cases use different 
emissions data for some pollutants than the official v4 platform to use data intended only for the 
rule development and not for general use. Unlike the 2005 v4 platform, the configuration for this 
modeling application included mercury emissions from the National Air Toxics Assessment 
Inventory and some industrial boiler sector mercury emissions more consistent with the 
engineering analysis for the Industrial/Commercial/Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters 
NESHAP. Emissions for the future years for the EGU sector utilized information collected from 
the utility MACT information collection request. Emissions are processed to photochemical 
model inputs with the SMOKE emissions modeling system (Houyoux et al., 2000). 
The 2016 baseline (or reference) case is intended to represent the emissions associated 
with growth and controls in that year projected from the 2005 simulation year. The United States 
EGU point source emissions estimates for the future year baseline and control case are based on 
an Integrated Planning Model (IPM) run for criteria pollutants, hydrochloric acid, and mercury in 
2016. Both control and growth factors were applied to a subset of the 2005 non-EGU point and 
non-point to create the 2016 baseline case.  The 2005 v4 platform 2014 projection factors were 
the starting point for most of the 2016 SMOKE-based projections. The mercury projections for 
non–EGU point sources accounted for emission reductions expected in the future due to 
NESHAP for various non-EGU source categories that were finalized or expected to be finalized 
prior to the Utility proposal including the Boiler MACT, Gold Mine NESHAP and Electric Arc 
Furnace NESHAP. The estimated total anthropogenic emissions and emissions for the utility 
sector used in the modeling assessment are shown in Table 4-2.  More details on these emissions 
can be found in Chapter 3.

impacts in the future due to reductions in emissions from this sector. Specifically, we compare a 
2016 baseline scenario to a 2016 control scenario (the proposed Toxics Rule interim values). The 
modeling assessment indicates a decrease up to 1.49 µg/m

 in annual PM2.5 design values is 
possible given an area‘s proximity to controlled sources. The median reduction in annual PM2.5 
design value over all monitor locations is 0.70 µg/m

An annual PM2.5 design value is the concentration that determines whether a monitoring

design value are given in appendix N of 40 CFR part 50. Projected air quality benefits are 
estimated using procedures outlined by United States Environmental Protection Agency 
modeling guidance (USEPA, 2007). 
4.3 Impacts of Sector on Future 24-hour PM2.5 Levels 
This section summarizes the results of our modeling of 24-hr average PM2.5 air quality 
impacts in the future due to reductions in emissions from this sector. Specifically, we compare a 
2016 baseline scenario to a 2016 control scenario (the interim results for the proposed Toxics 
Rule). A decrease up to 3.1 µg/m
3
 in 24-hr average PM2.5 design value at monitor locations in the 
United States is possible given an area‘s proximity to controlled sources and the amount of 
reduced emissions from those sources. A median decrease of 1.2 µg/m
3
 in 24-hr average PM2.5 
 4-7 
design value at monitor locations in the United States is possible given an area‘s proximity to 
controlled sources and the amount of reduced emissions from those sources.

A 24-hour PM2.5 design value is the concentration that determines whether a monitoring 
site meets the 24-hour NAAQS for PM2.5.  The full details involved in calculating a 24-hour 
PM2.5 design value are given in appendix N of 40 CFR part 50. Projected air quality benefits are 
estimated using procedures outlined by United States Environmental Protection Agency 
modeling guidance (USEPA, 2007). 
4.4 Impacts of Sector on Future Visibility Levels 
Air quality modeling conducted for this rule was used to project visibility conditions in 
138 mandatory Class I federal areas across the U.S. in 2016 (USEPA, 2007).  The level of 
visibility impairment in an area is based on the light-extinction coefficient and a unitless 
 4-8 
visibility index, called a ―deciview‖, which is used in the valuation of visibility.  The deciview 
metric provides a scale for perceived visual changes over the entire range of conditions, from 
clear to hazy. Under many scenic conditions, the average person can generally perceive a change 
of one deciview. Higher deciview values are indicative of worse visibility. Thus, an 
improvement in visibility is a decrease in deciview value. 
The modeling assessment indicates a median visibility improvement of 0.06 deciviews in 
annual 20% worst visibility days over all Class I area monitors. An improvement in visibility up 
to 2.68 deciviews on the 20% worst visibility days at Class I monitor locations in the United 
States is possible given an area‘s proximity to controlled sources and the amount of reduced 
emissions from these sources. 
4.5 Impacts of Sector on Future Ozone Levels 
This section summarizes the results of our modeling of 8-hr maximum ozone air quality 
impacts in the future due to reductions in emissions from this sector. Specifically, we compare a 
2016 baseline scenario to a 2016 control scenario. The modeling assessment indicates a decrease 
of up to 3.5 ppb in 8-hr averaged ozone design value is possible given an area‘s proximity to 
controlled sources and the amount of reduced emissions from these sources. A median decrease 
of 0.20 ppb in 8-hr averaged ozone design value is possible given an area‘s proximity to 
controlled sources and the amount of reduced emissions from these sources. The full details 
involved in calculating design value are given in appendix P of 40 CFR part 50. Projected air 
quality benefits are estimated using procedures outlined by United States Environmental 
Protection Agency modeling guidance (USEPA, 2007).

in the future based on changes to source sector emissions. Available data indicate that the 
mercury emissions from these sources in the 2016 baseline scenario are a mixture of gaseous 
elemental mercury (73%), inorganic divalent mercury (reactive gas phase mercury) (24%), and 
particulate bound mercury (2%). Model results for the continental United States indicate that 
total mercury deposition (wet and dry forms) reductions from this sector would be 24,000 µg/m
2
 
(1.0% of total mercury deposition from all sources).

MERCURY AND OTHER HAP BENEFITS ANALYSIS 
5.1 Introduction 
This chapter provides an analysis of the benefits of the proposed Toxics Rule from 
mercury and reductions of other HAP. This analysis builds on the methodologies developed 
previously for the 2005 Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR).  This is a national scale assessment 
which focuses on the exposures to methylmercury in populations who consume self-caught 
freshwater fish (recreational fishers and their families).  While there are other routes of exposure, 
including self-caught saltwater fish and commercially purchased fresh and saltwater fish, these 
exposures are not evaluated because 1) for self-caught saltwater fish, we are unable to estimate 
the reduction in fish tissue methylmercury that would be associated with reductions in mercury 
deposition from U.S. EGUs, and 2) for commercially purchased ocean fish, it is nearly 
impossible to determine the source of the methylmercury in those fish, and thus we could not 
attribute mercury levels to U.S. EGUs.  This benefits analysis focuses on reductions in lost IQ 
points in the population, because of the discrete nature of the effect, and because we are able to 
assign an economic value to IQ points.  There are other neurological effects associated with 
exposures to methylmercury, including impacts on motor skills and attention/behavior and 
therefore, risk estimates based on IQ will not cover these additional endpoints and therefore 
could further underestimate overall neurodevelopmental impacts.  In addition, the NRC (2001) 
noted that ―there remains some uncertainty about the possibility of other health effects at low 
levels of exposure. In particular, there are indications of immune and cardiovascular effects, as 
well as neurological effects emerging later in life, that have not been adequately studied.‖  These 
limitations suggest that the benefits of mercury reductions are understated by our analysis, 
however, the magnitude of the additional benefits is highly uncertain 
In Section 5.2, we discuss the potential health effects of mercury. Section 5.3 provides a 
discussion of mercury in the environment, including potential impacts on wildlife. Section 5.4 
describes the resulting change in mercury deposition from air quality modeling of the proposed 
Toxics rule. Section 5.5 presents information on key data and assumptions used in conducting 
the benefits analysis. Section 5.6 presents information on a dose-response function that relates 
mercury consumption in women of childbearing with changes in IQ seen in children that were 
exposed prenatally. IQ is used as a surrogate for the neurobehavioral endpoints that EPA relied 
upon for setting the methylmercury reference dose (RfD). Section 5.7 presents exposure 
modeling and benefit methodologies applied to a no-threshold model (i.e., a model that assumes 
no threshold in effects at low doses of mercury exposure). Section 5.8 presents the final benefits 
 5-2 
and risk estimates for recreational freshwater anglers and selected high-risk subpopulations. 
Section 5.9 presents a qualitative description of the benefits from reductions in HAPs other than 
mercury that will take place as a result of the proposed Toxics Rule. 
For this benefits assessment, EPA chose to focus on quantification of intelligence 
quotient (IQ) decrements associated with prenatal mercury exposure as the initial endpoint for 
quantification and valuation of mercury health benefits. Reasons for this initial focus on IQ 
included the availability of thoroughly-reviewed, high-quality epidemiological studies assessing 
IQ or related cognitive outcomes suitable for IQ estimation, and the availability of well-
established methods and data for economic valuation of avoided IQ deficits, as applied in EPA‘s 
previous benefits analyses for childhood lead exposure. 
The quantitative estimates of human health benefits and risk levels provided in Section 
5.2 consist of two primary sets of analysis: 1) A national-scale assessment of economic benefits 
associated with avoided IQ loss due to reduced methylmercury (MeHg) exposure among 
recreational freshwater anglers; and 2) Modeled risk levels, in terms of IQ loss, for six high-risk 
subpopulations as a means of estimating potential disproportionate impacts on demographic 
groups with traditionally subsistence or near-subsistence rates of fish consumption. 
The first analysis (Section 5.2.1) estimates benefits from avoided IQ loss under various 
regulatory scenarios for all recreational freshwater anglers in the 48 contiguous U.S. states. The 
average effect on individual avoided IQ loss in 2016 is 0.00209 IQ points, with total nationwide 
benefits estimated between $0.5 and $6.1 million.1 In contrast, the subpopulations analyses 
(Section 5.2.2) focus on specific demographic groups with relatively high levels of fish 
consumption. For example, an African-American child in the Southeast born in 2016 to a mother 
consuming fish at the 90
th
 percentile of published subsistence-like levels is estimated to 
experience a loss of 7.711 IQ points as a result of in-utero MeHg exposure from all sources in 
the absence of a Toxics Rule.2
 
The implementation of the Toxics Rule would reduce the expected 
IQ loss for this child by an estimated 0.176 IQ points.

 Monetized benefits estimates are for an immediate change in MeHg levels in fish.  If a lag in the response of MeHg 
levels in fish were assumed, the monetized benefits could be significantly lower, depending on the length of the 
lag and the discount rate used.  As noted in the discussion of the Mercury Maps modeling, the relationship 
between deposition and fish tissue MeHg is proportional in equilibrium, but the MMaps approach does not 
provide any information on the time lag of response. 
2
 We do note that overall confidence in IQ loss estimates above approximately 7 points decreases because we begin 
to apply the underlying IQ loss function at exposure levels (ppm hair levels) above those reflected in 
epidemiological studies used to derive those functions. The 39.1 ppm was the highest measured ppm level in the 
Faroes Island study, while ~86 was the highest value in the New Zealand study (USEPA, 2005) (a 7 IQ points

5.2 Impact of Mercury on Human Health 
5.2.1 Introduction 
Mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative toxic metal that is emitted from power plants in 
three forms:  gaseous elemental Hg (Hg
0
), oxidized Hg compounds (Hg
+2
), and particle-bound 
Hg (HgP).  Elemental Hg does not quickly deposit or chemically react in the atmosphere, 
resulting in residence times that are long enough to contribute to global scale deposition.  
Oxidized Hg and HgP deposit quickly from the atmosphere impacting local and regional areas in 
proximity to sources.  Methylmercury (MeHg) is formed by microbial action in the top layers of 
sediment and soils, after Hg has precipitated from the air and deposited into waterbodies or land.  
Once formed, MeHg is taken up by aquatic organisms and bioaccumulates up the aquatic food 
web.  Larger predatory fish may have MeHg concentrations many times, typically on the order of 
one million times, that of the concentrations in the freshwater body in which they live.  Although 
Hg is toxic to humans when it is inhaled or ingested, we focus in this rulemaking on exposure to 
MeHg through ingestion of fish, as it is the primary route for human exposures in the U.S., and 
potential health risks do not likely result from Hg inhalation exposures associated with Hg 
emissions from utilities. 
In 2000, the National Research Council (NRC) of the NAS issued the NAS Study, which 
provides a thorough review of the effects of MeHg on human health.  There are numerous 
studies that have been published more recently that report effects on neurologic and other 
endpoints. 
5.2.2 Reference and Benchmark Doses 
In 1995, EPA set a health-based ingestion rate for chronic oral exposure to MeHg termed 
an oral Reference Dose (RfD), at 0.0001 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg-day).
1
  The 
RfD was based on effects reported for children exposed in utero during the Iraqi Hg poisoning 
episode, in which children were exposed to high levels of Hg when their mothers consumed 
contaminated grain (Marsh et al., 1987).  Subsequent research from large epidemiological studies 
in the Seychelles (Davidson et al., 1995), Faroe Islands (Grandjean et al., 1997), and New 
Zealand (Kjellstrom et al., 1989) added substantially to the body of knowledge on neurological 
effects from MeHg exposure.  In 2001 EPA established a revised RfD based on the advice of the 
NAS and an independent review panel convened as part of the Integrated Risk Information 
                                                                                                                                                             
loss is approximately associated with a 40 ppm hair level given the concentration-response function we are 
using). 
1 MeHg exposure  is measured as milligrams of MeHg per kilogram of bodyweight per day, thus normalizing for 
the size of fish meals and the differences in bodyweight among exposed individuals. 
 5-4 
System (IRIS) process.  In their analysis, the NAS examined in detail the epidemiological data 
from the Seychelles, the Faroe Islands, and New Zealand, as well as other toxicological data on 
MeHg.  The NAS recommended that neurobehavioral deficits as measured in several different 
tests among these studies be used as the basis for the RfD. 
The NAS proposed that the Faroe Islands cohort was the most appropriate study for 
defining an RfD, and specifically selected children‘s performance on the Boston Naming Test (a 
neurobehavioral test) as the key endpoint.  Results from all three studies were considered in 
defining the RfD, as published in the ―2001 Water Quality for the Protection of Human Health:  
Methylmercury‖ and in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) summary for MeHg:  
―Rather than choose a single measure for the RfD critical endpoint, EPA based this RfD for this 
assessment on several scores from the Faroes‘ measures, with supporting analyses from the New 
Zealand study, and the integrative analysis of all three studies.‖ (USEPA, 2002). 
EPA defined the updated RfD of 0.0001 mg/kg-day in 2001 (USEPA, 2002).  Although 
derived from a more complete data set and with a somewhat different methodology, the current 
RfD is numerically the same as the previous (1995) RfD (0.0001 mg/kg-day, or 0.1 µg/kg-day). 
This RfD, consistent with the standard definition, is an estimate (with uncertainty 
spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a daily exposure to the human population (including 
sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a 
lifetime (EPA, 2002).  In general EPA believes that exposures at or below the RfD are unlikely 
to be associated with appreciable risk of deleterious effects.  However, no RfD defines an 
exposure level corresponding to zero risk; moreover the RfD does not represent a bright line, 
above which individuals are at risk of adverse effects.  EPA‘s interpretation for this assessments 
is that any exposures to MeHg above the RfD are of concern given the nature of the data 
available for mercury that is not necessarily available for many other chemicals, where exposures 
have often had to be significantly above the RfD before they might be considered as causing a 
hazard to public health.  The scientific basis for the mercury RfD includes extensive human data 
and extensive data on sensitive subpopulations, including pregnant mothers; therefore, the RfD 
does not include extrapolations from animals to humans, and from the general population to 
sensitive subpopulations.  In addition, there was no evidence of a threshold for MeHg-related 
neurotoxicity within the range of exposures in the Faroe Islands study which served as the 
primary basis for the RfD.  This additional confidence in the basis for the RfD suggests that all 
exposures above the RfD can be interpreted with more confidence as causing a potential hazard 
to public health. Studies published since the current MeHg RfD was released include new 
analyses of children‘s neuropsychological effects from the existing Seychelles and Faroe Islands 
 5-5 
cohorts, including formation of a new cohort in the Faroe Islands study.  There are also a number 
of new studies that were conducted in population-based cohorts in the U.S. and other countries.  
A comprehensive assessment of the new literature has not been completed by EPA.  However, 
data published since 2001 are generally consistent with those of the earlier studies that were the 
basis of the RfD, demonstrating persistent effects in the Faroe Island cohort, and in some cases 
associations of effects with lower MeHg exposure concentrations than in the Faroes.  These new 
studies provide additional confidence that exposures above the RfD are contributing to risk of 
adverse effects, and that reductions in exposures above the RfD can lead to incremental 
reductions in risk. 
5.2.3 Neurologic Effects 
In its review of the literature, the NAS found neurodevelopmental effects to be the most 
sensitive and best documented endpoints and appropriate for establishing an RfD (NRC, 2000); 
in particular NAS supported the use of results from neurobehavioral or neuropsychological tests.  
The NAS report (NRC, 2000) noted that studies in animals reported sensory effects as well as 
effects on brain development and memory functions and support the conclusions based on 
epidemiology studies.  The NAS noted that their recommended endpoints for an RfD are 
associated with the ability of children to learn and to succeed in school.  They concluded the 
following:  ―The population at highest risk is the children of women who consumed large 
amounts of fish and seafood during pregnancy.  The committee concludes that the risk to that 
population is likely to be sufficient to result in an increase in the number of children who have to 
struggle to keep up in school.‖ 
5.2.4 Cardiovascular Impacts 
The NAS summarized data on cardiovascular effects available up to 2000.  Based on 
these and other studies, the NRC (2000) concluded that ―Although the data base is not as 
extensive for cardiovascular effects as it is for other end points (i.e. neurologic effects) the 
cardiovascular system appears to be a target for MeHg toxicity in humans and animals.‖ The 
NRC also stated that ―additional studies are needed to better characterize the effect of 
methylmercury exposure on blood pressure and cardiovascular function at various stages of life.‖ 
Additional cardiovascular studies have been published since 2000.  EPA did not to 
develop a quantitative dose-response assessment for cardiovascular effects associated with 
MeHg exposures, as there is no consensus among scientists on the dose-response functions for 
these effects.  In addition, there is inconsistency among available studies as to the association 
between MeHg exposure and various cardiovascular system effects.  The pharmacokinetics of 
 5-6 
some of the exposure measures (such as toenail Hg levels) are not well understood.  The studies 
have not yet received the review and scrutiny of the more well-established neurotoxicity data 
base. 
5.2.5 Genotoxic Effects 
The Mercury Study noted that MeHg is not a potent mutagen but is capable of causing 
chromosomal damage in a number of experimental systems.  The NAS concluded that evidence 
that human exposure to MeHg caused genetic damage is inconclusive; they note that some earlier 
studies showing chromosomal damage in lymphocytes may not have controlled sufficiently for 
potential confounders.  One study of adults living in the Tapajós River region in Brazil (Amorim 
et al., 2000) reported a direct relationship between MeHg concentration in hair and DNA damage 
in lymphocytes; as well as effects on chromosomes.  Long-term MeHg exposures in this 
population were believed to occur through consumption of fish, suggesting that genotoxic effects 
(largely chromosomal aberrations) may result from dietary, chronic MeHg exposures similar to 
and above those seen in the Faroes and Seychelles populations. 
5.2.6 Immunotoxic Effects 
Although exposure to some forms of Hg can result in a decrease in immune activity or an 
autoimmune response (ATSDR, 1999), evidence for immunotoxic effects of MeHg is limited 
(NRC, 2000). 
5.2.7 Other Human Toxicity Data 
Based on limited human and animal data, MeHg is classified as a ―possible‖ human 
carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 1994) and in IRIS 
(USEPA, 2002).
 
 The existing evidence supporting the possibility of carcinogenic effects in 
humans from low-dose chronic exposures is tenuous.  Multiple human epidemiological studies 
have found no significant association between Hg exposure and overall cancer incidence, 
although a few studies have shown an association between Hg exposure and specific types of 
cancer incidence (e.g., acute leukemia and liver cancer) (NAS, 2000). 
There is also some evidence of reproductive and renal toxicity in humans from MeHg 
exposure.  However, overall, human data regarding reproductive, renal, and hematological 
toxicity from MeHg are very limited and are based on either studies of the two high-dose 
poisoning episodes in Iraq and Japan or animal data, rather than epidemiological studies of 
chronic exposures at the levels of interest in this analysis.

5.3 Impact of Mercury on Ecosystems and Wildlife 
5.3.1 Introduction 
Deposition of mercury to waterbodies can also have an impact on ecosystems and 
wildlife. Mercury contamination is present in all environmental media with aquatic systems 
experiencing the greatest exposures due to bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation refers to the net 
uptake of a contaminant from all possible pathways and includes the accumulation that may 
occur by direct exposure to contaminated media as well as uptake from food. 
Atmospheric mercury enters freshwater ecosystems by direct deposition and through 
runoff from terrestrial watersheds. Once mercury deposits, it may be converted to organic 
methylmercury mediated primarily by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Methylation is enhanced in 
anaerobic and acidic environments, greatly increasing mercury toxicity and potential to 
bioaccumulate in aquatic foodwebs. A number of key biogeochemical controls influence the 
production of methylmercury in aquatic ecosystems. These include sulfur, pH, organic matter, 
iron, mercury ―aging‖, and bacteria type and activity (Munthe et al., 2007). 
Wet and dry deposition of oxidized mercury is a dominant pathway for bringing mercury 
to terrestrial surfaces. In forest ecosystems, elemental mercury may also be absorbed by plants 
stomatally, incorporated by foliar tissues and released in litterfall (Ericksen et al., 2003). 
Mercury in throughfall, direct deposition in precipitation, and uptake of dissolved mercury by 
roots (Rea et al., 2002) are also important in mercury accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems. 
Soils have significant capacity to store large quantities of atmospherically deposited 
mercury where it can leach into groundwater and surface waters. The risk of mercury exposure 
extends to insectivorous terrestrial species such as songbirds, bats, spiders, and amphibians that 
receive mercury deposition or from aquatic systems near the forest areas they inhabit (Bergeron 
et al., 2010a, b; Cristol et al., 2008; Rimmer et al., 2005; Wada et al., 2009 & 2010). 
Numerous studies have generated field data on the levels of mercury in a variety of wild 
species. Many of the data from these environmental studies are anecdotal in nature rather than 
representative or statistically designed studies. The body of work examining the effects of these 
 5-9 
exposures is growing but still incomplete given the complexities of the natural world. A large 
portion of the adverse effect research conducted to date has been carried out in the laboratory 
setting rather than in the wild; thus, conclusions about overarching ecosystem health and 
population effects are difficult to make at this time. In the sections that follow numerous effects 
have been identified at differing exposure levels. 
5.3.2 Effects on Fish 
A review of the literature on effects of mercury on fish (Crump and Trudeau, 2009) 
reports results for numerous species including trout, bass (large and smallmouth), northern pike, 
carp, walleye, salmon and others from laboratory and field studies. The effects studied are 
reproductive and include deficits in sperm and egg formation, histopathological changes in testes 
and ovaries, and disruption of reproductive hormone synthesis. These studies were conducted in 
areas from New York to Washington and while many were conducted by adding MeHg to water 
or diet many were conducted at current environmental levels. While we cannot determine at this 
time whether these reproductive deficits are affecting fish populations across the United States it 
should be noted that it is possible that over time reproductive deficits could have an effect on 
populations. Lower fish populations would conceivably impact the ecosystem services like 
recreational fishing derived from having healthy aquatic ecosystems quite apart from the effects 
of consumption advisories due to the human health effects of mercury. 
The Integrated Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen and Sulfur – Ecological 
Criteria (Final Report, 2008) presents information regarding the possible complementary effects 
of sulfur and mercury deposition. The ISA has concluded that there is a causal relationship 
between sulfur deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands and aquatic 
environments. This suggests that lowering the rate of sulfur deposition would also reduce 
mercury methylation thus alleviating the effects of aquatic acidification as well as the effects of 
mercury on fish. 
5.3.3 Effects on Birds 
In addition to effects on fish, mercury also affects avian species. In previous reports (EPA 
1997 and CAMR 2005) much of the focus has been on large piscivorous species, in particular the 
common loon. The loon is most visible to the public during the summer breeding season on 
northern lakes and they have become an important symbol of wilderness in these areas (McIntyre 
and Barr 1997). A multitude of loon watch, preservation, and protection groups have formed 
over the past few decades and have been instrumental in promoting conservation, education, 
monitoring, and research of breeding loons (McIntyre and Evers 2000, Evers 2006). Significant 
 5-10 
adverse effects on breeding loons from mercury have been found to occur, including behavioral 
(reduced nest-sitting), physiological (flight feather asymmetry), and reproductive (chicks 
fledged/territorial pair) effects (Evers, 2008, Burgess, 2008) and reduced survival (Mitro et al., 
2008). Additionally Evers et al. (2008) report that they believe that results from their study 
integrating the effects on the endpoints listed above and evidence from other studies the weight 
of evidence indicates that population-level effects negatively impacting population viability 
occur in parts of Maine and New Hampshire, and potentially in broad areas of the loon‘s range. 
Recently attention has turned to other piscivorous species such as the white ibis and great 
snowy egret. While considered to be fish-eating generally these wading birds have a diverse diet 
including crayfish, crabs, snails, insects and frogs. These species are experiencing a range of 
adverse effects due to exposure to mercury. The white ibis has been observed to have decreased 
foraging efficiency (Adams and Frederick, 2008). Additionally ibises have been shown to exhibit 
decreased reproductive success and altered pair behavior at chronic exposure to levels of dietary 
MeHg commonly encountered by wild birds (Frederick and Jayasena, 2010). These effects 
include significantly more unproductive nests, male/male pairing, reduced courtship behavior 
(head bobbing and pair bowing) and lower nestling production by exposed males. In this study a 
worst-case scenario suggested by the results could involve up to a 50% reduction in fledglings 
due to MeHg in diet. These estimates may be conservative if male/male pairing in the wild 
resulted in a shortage of partners for females and the effect of homosexual breeding were 
magnified. In egrets mercury has been implicated in the decline of the species in south Florida 
(Sepulveda et al., 1999) and Hoffman (2010) has shown that egrets experience liver and possibly 
kidney effects. While ibises and egrets are most abundant in coastal areas and these studies were 
conducted in south Florida and Nevada, the ranges of ibises and egrets extend to a large portion 
of the United States. Ibis territory can range inland to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee. Egret 
range covers virtually the entire United States except the mountain west. Insectivorous birds 
have also been shown to suffer adverse effects due to current levels of mercury exposure. These 
songbirds such as Bicknell‘s thrush, tree swallows and the great tit have shown reduced 
reproduction, survival, and changes in singing behavior. Exposed tree swallows produced fewer 
fledglings (Brasso, 2008), lower survival (Hallinger, 2010) and had compromised immune 
competence (Hawley, 2009). The great tit has exhibited reduced singing behavior and smaller 
song repertoire in an area of high contamination in the vicinity of a metallurgic smelter in 
Flanders (Gorissen, 2005). While these effects were small and would likely have little effect on 
population viability in such a short-lived species.

5.3.4 Effects on Mammals 
In mammals adverse effects have been observed in mink and river otter collected in the 
wild in the northeast where atmospheric deposition from municipal waste incinerators and 
electric utilities are the largest sources (USEPA, 1999), both fish eating species. For otter from 
Maine and Vermont maximum concentrations on Hg in fur nearly equal or exceed a 
concentration associated with mortality. Concentrations in liver for mink in 
Massachusetts/Connecticut and the levels in fur from mink in Maine exceed concentrations 
associated with acute mortality (Yates, 2005). Adverse sub-lethal effects may be associated with 
lower Hg concentrations and consequently be more widespread than potential acute effects. 
These effects may include increased activity, poorer maze performance, abnormal startle reflex, 
and impaired escape and avoidance behavior (Scheuhammer et al., 2007). Conclusions 
The studies cited here provide a glimpse of the scope of mercury effects on wildlife 
particularly reproductive and survival effects at current exposure levels. These effects range 
across species from fish to mammals and spatially across a wide area of the United States. The 
literature is far from complete however. Much more research is required to establish a link 
between the ecological effects on wildlife and the effect on ecosystem services (services that the 
environment provides to people) for example recreational fishing, bird watching and wildlife 
viewing. EPA is not, however, currently able to quantify or monetize the benefits of reducing 
mercury exposures affecting provision of ecosystem services.

5.4 Mercury Risk and Exposure Analyses – Data Inputs and  Assumptions 
5.4.1 Introduction 
This section provides information regarding key data inputs and assumptions used in this 
assessment. The section begins with a description of the populations modeled in this assessment, 
follows with information about the data used to estimate MeHg concentrations in fish, and closes 
with a summary of the science and related assumptions used in this assessment to link changes in 
modeled mercury deposition to changes in fish tissue concentrations. 
5.4.2 Data Inputs 
Populations Assessed For the National Aggregate Estimates of Exposed Populations in 
Freshwater Fishing Households 
The main source of data for identifying the size and location of the potentially exposed 
populations is the Census 2000 data, summarized at the tract-level. There are roughly 64,500 
tracts in the continental United States, with populations generally ranging between 1,500 and 
8,000 inhabitants. For the national aggregate analysis of exposure levels, the specific population 
of interest drawn from these data is the number of women aged 15 to 44 (i.e., childbearing age) 
in each tract. To predict populations in later years (2005 and 2016), we applied county-level 
population growth projections for the corresponding population category (Woods and Poole, 
2008) to the 2000 tract-level data. To specifically estimate the portion of these populations that 
are pregnant in any given year, we applied state-level 2006 fertility rate (live births per 1,000 
women aged 15 to 44 years) data from U.S. Vital Statistics (DHHS, 2009). 
Two main sources of national-level recreation activity data are available and suitable for 
estimating the size and spatial distribution of freshwater recreational angler populations and 
activities in the United States: 
 the National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation 
(FHWAR), maintained by the Department of the Interior (DOI) (DOI and DOC, 
1992, 1997, 2002, 2007) and 
 5-15 
 the National Survey of Recreation and the Environment (USDA, 1994). 
FHWAR Angler Data. The FHWAR, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau about every 
5 years since 1955, includes data on the number and characteristics of participants as well as 
time and money spent on hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching. The most recent survey and 
report are for recreational activities conducted in 2006 (DOI and DOC, 2007). Data from this 
report were used to provide the most recent estimate of the percentage of the resident population 
in each state (16 years old or older) that engaged in freshwater fishing during the year. As shown 
in Table 5-1, these percentages vary from 3% (New Jersey) to 27% (Minnesota).

The methodology for assessing mercury exposures also requires a further breakdown of 
freshwater fishing activities into two categories: rivers (including rivers and streams) and lakes 
(including lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and other flat water). Data at this level of detail are not 
reported in the summary national reports for the FHWAR; however, they are available from the 
FHWAR survey household-level data. For this analysis, data from a previous analysis and 
summary of the 2001 FHWAR household-level survey data (EPA, 2005) were used to provide 
estimates of the percentage of freshwater fishing days by residents in each state that were to 
either the lake or river category.1 As shown in Table 5-1, the highest percentage going to lakes is 
in Minnesota (89%) and the highest to rivers is in Oregon (61%). 
NSRE Angler Data. The NSRE, formerly known as the National Recreation Survey 
(NRS), is a nationally administered survey, which has been conducted periodically since 1962.  
It is designed to assess outdoor recreation participation in the United States and elicit information

 Although the total number of fishing trips varies from year to year, there is little reason to expect that the ratio of 
river trips to lake trips would have changed significantly since 2001. For this reason, given resource and 
timetable limitations, we did not update this input to the analysis. 
 5-18 
regarding people‘s opinions about their natural environment. The NSRE sample of freshwater 
anglers is smaller than the FHWAR sample, but it is nonetheless a useful resource because it 
provides a wide variety of information about fishing activities. Importantly, it includes relatively 
detailed information about the nature and location of recent freshwater trips. Because the 
sampling procedure is designed to be representative, inferences may be drawn about the relative 
popularity of particular types of freshwater bodies (e.g., lakes, rivers) among the general public 
and the average distance traveled to reach these sites. Although more recent NSRE surveys have 
been conducted in 2000 and 2009, data from 1994 survey (NSRE, 1994) is used for this analysis 
because it contains the most detailed information regarding fishing trip destinations. 
The NSRE 1994 elicited information from respondents about the most recent fishing trip. 
One of the main advantages of NSRE 1994 is that it includes geocoded data for reported fishing 
destinations. To specify the location of the last fishing trip, respondents were asked to provide 
the name of the waterbody, the nearest town to the waterbody, and an estimate of the distance 
and direction from their home to the waterbody. Appendix B describes how these data were used 
in this analysis to estimate the percentage of freshwater fishing trips that were in different 
distance intervals from respondents‘ homes. Using the demographic data from the NSRE, these 
estimates were further differentiated according to the income level and urban versus nonurban 
location of the respondents. 
High-Consuming Subpopulations in the United States 
Based on a detailed review of the literature, we identified several subpopulations with 
particularly high potential risks of mercury exposure due to relatively high rates of freshwater 
fish consumption (Moya, 2004; Burger 2002, Shilling et al. 2010, Dellinger, 2004). The analysis 
of potentially high-risk groups focuses on six subpopulations: 
 low-income African-American recreational/subsistence fishers in the Southeast 
region1 
 low-income white recreational/subsistence fishers in the Southeast region 
 low-income female recreational/subsistence fishers 
 Hispanic subsistence fishers 
                                                 
1 
Southeast for purposes of this analysis comprises Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
 5-19 
 Laotian subsistence fishers 
 Chippewa/Ojibwe Tribe members in the Great Lakes area 
To identify the size and spatial distribution of these potentially high-risk groups, we again 
used Census 2000 tract-level population data. These data identify tract-level populations in the 
year 2000 for each of the specified racial/ethnic definitions and, more specifically, for low-
income African-American, white, and female populations. For this part of the analysis, the low-
income designation is based on the tract-level estimates of subpopulations living in poverty. 
Population size projections for future years (beyond 2000) in each selected tract were based on 
county-level growth projections for the full population (all ages and both sexes) in the most 
closely corresponding race category (Woods and Poole, 2008). For example, the Asian and 
Native American categories in the county-level growth projection data were used for the Laotian 
and Chippewa population projections, respectively. 
For the analysis of Chippewa subpopulation exposures, the analysis was spatially 
restricted to only include census tracts in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan with centroids 
that are located no more than 20 miles from the main tribal fishing area (the justification for this 
travel distance limitation is discussed below). The Chippewa tribal fishing areas in these states 
were defined as the territories around the Great Lakes that have been ceded to the Chippewa for 
tribal fishing rights. The boundaries of this tribal fishing area are shown in yellow in Figure 5-1.

5.4.3 Mercury Concentrations in Freshwater Fish 
Data Sources for Fish Tissue Concentrations 
To characterize the spatial distribution of mercury concentration estimates in freshwater 
fish across the country, we compiled data from three main sources, which are described below. 
National Listing of Fish Advisory (NLFA) database. The NLFA, managed by EPA 
(http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/fishshellfish/fishadvisories/), collects and compiles fish 
tissue sample data from all 50 states and from tribes across the United States. In particular, it 
contains data for over 43,000 mercury fish tissue samples collected from 1995 to 2007. 
U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) compilation of mercury datasets. As part of its 
Environmental Mercury Mapping and Analysis (EMMA) program, USGS compiled mercury fish 
tissue sample data from a wide variety of sources (including the NLFA) and has posted these 
 5-21 
data at http://emmma.usgs.gov/datasets.aspx. The compilation includes (1) state-agency collected 
and reported data (including Delaware, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South 
Carolina, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia) from over 40,000 fish tissue samples, 
covering the period 1995 to 2007 and (2) over 10,000 fish tissue samples from several other 
sources, including the National Fish Tissue Survey, the National Pesticide Monitoring Program 
(NPMP), the National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program (NCBP), the Biomonitoring of 
Environmental Status and Trends (BEST) datasets of the USFWS and USGS 
(http://www.cerc.cr.usgs.gov/data/data.htm), and the Environmental Monitoring and Analysis 
Program (EMAP) (http://www.epa.gov/emap/). 
EPA’s National River and Stream Assessment (NRSA) study data. These data include 
nearly 600 fish tissue mercury samples collected at randomly selected freshwater sites across the 
United States during the period 2008 to 2009. 
Approach for Compiling Fish Tissue Dataset for Exposure Analysis 
Data from these three datasets were combined into a single master fish tissue dataset 
covering the period 1995 to 2009. One problem encountered in combining these datasets is the 
potential duplication of samples in the NLFA and USGS state-collected data. Unfortunately, 
these two datasets do not contain directly comparable and unique identifiers that allow duplicate 
samples to be easily identified and removed. Therefore, as an alternative, the samples from these 
two datasets were subdivided into data groups according to the year and state in which they were 
collected. If both datasets contained a data group for the same year and the same state, then the 
data group with the fewer number of observations was excluded from the master data. 
The following criteria were also applied to exclude data from the master fish tissue 
dataset to be used in the analysis. Samples were excluded if they: 
 did not include useable latitude-longitude coordinates for spatial identification; 
 were located at sites outside the tidal boundaries of the continental United States (i.e., 
if they were not sampled from freshwater sites); 
 did not come from fish species found in freshwater; or 
 did not come from sampled fish that were at least 7 inches in length (i.e., unlikely to 
be consumed). 
 5-22 
Each remaining sample was then categorized as either a river or lake sample based on 
information about the sampling site location. First, specific character strings in the site names 
(e.g., ―river,‖ ―creek,‖ ―lake,‖ ―pond,‖ and ―reservoir‖) were used to classify sites. Second, 
remaining sites were categorized based on a GIS analysis that linked the sites‘ latitude-longitude 
coordinates to the nearest waterbody and its category. 
The resulting master fish tissue mercury concentration dataset contains 26,940 sample 
concentration estimates from 3,876 river sites and 23,206 estimates from 2,167 lake sites. 
A new dataset was then created by spatially grouping and averaging the river and lake 
concentration estimates at the HUC-12 sub-watershed level. First, all of the mercury sampling 
sites included in the master data were mapped and matched to the HUC-12 sub-watersheds in 
which they are located. A total of 3,884 HUC-12s in the continental United States (4.6%) contain 
at least one river or lake mercury sample.1 Second, site-specific average mercury concentration 
values were generated by computing the mean concentration estimate at each site. Third, HUC-
level average lake concentration estimates were computed as the mean of the site-specific 
average lake concentration estimates for each HUC containing at least one lake sampling site 
(1,396 HUCs). Fourth, HUC-level average river concentration estimates were computed as the 
mean of the site-specific average river concentration estimates for each HUC containing at least 
one river sampling site (2,655 HUCs). 
Summary of Fish Tissue Mercury Concentration Estimates Used in the Exposure Analysis 
The resulting HUC-level mercury concentration dataset is summarized in Table 5-2. The 
average HUC-level mercury concentration estimate for lakes is 0.29 ppm and for rivers is 0.26 
ppm.  The large standard deviations and ranges reported in the table also reflect the considerable 
spatial variation in lake and river concentration estimates across samples. As described below, 
the analysis uses this inter-watershed spatial variation (rather than just the average point estimate 
across watersheds) to estimate mercury exposures.  However, in this analysis, exposure estimates 
were only generated for populations linked to these HUCs containing at least one river or lake 
mercury fish tissue sample.

 This number excludes 15 HUC-12s containing mercury samples. These HUC-12s were excluded from the analysis 
due to their proximity to potentially significant non-air sources of mercury, including gold mines or non-EGU 
mercury sources included in the 2008 Toxic Release Inventory.

5.5 Linking Changes in Modeled Mercury Deposition to Changes in Fish Tissue 
Concentrations 
5.5.1 Introduction 
In the United States, humans are exposed to MeHg mainly by consuming fish that contain 
MeHg. Accordingly, to estimate changes in human exposure EPA must analyze how changes in 
Hg deposition from U.S. coal-fired power plants translate into changes in MeHg concentrations 
in fish. Quantifying the linkage between different levels of Hg deposition and fish tissue MeHg 
concentration is an important step in the risk assessment process and the focus of the material 
described in this chapter. 
To effectively estimate fish MeHg concentrations in a given ecosystem, it is important to 
understand that the behavior of Hg in aquatic ecosystems is a complex function of the chemistry, 
biology, and physical dynamics of different ecosystems. The majority (95 to 97 percent) of the 
Hg that enters lakes, rivers, and estuaries from direct atmospheric deposition is in the inorganic 
form (Lin and Pehkonen, 1999). Microbes convert a small fraction of the pool of inorganic Hg in 
the water and sediments of these ecosystems into the organic form of Hg (MeHg). MeHg is the 
only form of Hg that biomagnifies in organisms (Bloom, 1992). Ecosystem-specific factors that 
affect both the bioavailability of inorganic Hg to methylating microbes (e.g., sulfide, dissolved 
 5-24 
organic carbon) and the activity of the microbes themselves (e.g., temperature, organic carbon, 
redox status) determine the rate of MeHg production and subsequent accumulation in fish 
(Benoit et al., 2003). The extent of MeHg bioaccumulation is also affected by the number of 
trophic levels in the food web (e.g., piscivorous fish populations) because MeHg biomagnifies as 
large piscivorous fish eat smaller organisms (Watras and Bloom, 1992; Wren and MacCrimmon, 
1986). These and other factors can result in considerable variability in fish MeHg levels among 
ecosystems at the regional and local scale. 
Use of Mercury Maps to Project Changes in Fish Tissue Concentrations 
To analyze the relationship between Hg deposition and MeHg concentrations in fish in 
freshwater aquatic ecosystems across the U.S. for the national scale benefits assessment, EPA 
applied EPA‘s Office of Water‘s Mercury Maps (MMaps) approach (US EPA, 2001a). MMaps 
implements a simplified form of the IEM-2M model applied in EPA‘s Mercury Study Report to 
Congress (USEPA, 1997). By simplifying the assumptions inherent in the freshwater ecosystem 
models that were described in the Report to Congress, the MMaps model showed that these 
models converge at a steady-state solution for MeHg concentrations in fish that are proportional 
to changes in Hg inputs from atmospheric deposition (i.e.,., over the long term, fish 
concentrations are expected to decline proportionally to declines in atmospheric loading to a 
waterbody). The temporal response time for a change in fish tissue MeHg levels following a 
change in mercury deposition can range from years to decades or more depending on the 
attributes of the watershed and waterbody involved.1 
MMaps has several limitations: 
1. The MMaps approach is based on the assumption of a linear, steady-state relationship 
between concentrations of MeHg in fish and present day air deposition mercury 
inputs. We expect that this condition will likely not be met in many waterbodies 
because of recent changes in mercury inputs and other environmental variables that 
affect mercury bioaccumulation. For example, the US has recently reduced human-
caused emissions while international emissions have increased.

 Research has suggested that fish tissue MeHg levels in some locations may display a multi-phase response 
following a discrete change in mercury deposition, with the first phase lasting a few years to a decade or more 
and primarily involving changes in aerial loading directly to the waterbody and the second phase lasting decade 
(to a century or more) and reflecting longer-term changes in watershed erosion and runoff to the waterbody 
(Knights et al., 2009, Harris et al., 2007).   
 5-25 
2. The requirement that environmental conditions remain constant over the time 
required to reach steady state inherent in the MMaps methodology may not be met, 
particularly in systems that respond slowly to changes in mercury inputs. 
3. Many water bodies, particularly in areas of historic gold and mercury mining, contain 
significant non-air sources of mercury. The MMaps methodology will yield biased 
results when applied to such waterbodies. As a simple illustrative example, if we have 
mercury deposition of 100 at a given location and a MeHg fish concentration of 6 in a 
local fish tissue sample, and a new emissions rule reduces deposition by half to 50, 
then, in the absence of other non-air deposition sources, we would assume that the 
MeHg fish concentration is reduced by the same proportion, to 3 ((50 / 100) x 6). 
However, if total pre-control mercury loading to the system is actually 100 plus 
another unaccounted for source (for example, an additional 100 due to area gold 
mining), then the MeHg fish concentration of 6 is actually due to 200 in total mercury 
loading. In this case, reducing mercury air deposition from 100 to 50 would only 
reduce the total loading by 25%, to 150, which, based on the MMaps methodology, 
would result in a MeHg fish concentration of 4.5 ((150 / 200) x 6) rather than 3. In 
areas where on-air deposition sources are unaccounted for, MMaps-based estimates 
of changes in MeHg fish tissue concentrations due to reduced mercury air emissions 
would therefore be biased high. 
4. Finally, MMaps does not provide for a calculation of the time lag between a reduction 
in mercury deposition and a reduction in the MeHg concentrations in fish and, as 
noted earlier, depending on the nature of the watersheds and waterbodies involved, 
the temporal response time for fish tissue MeHg levels following a change in mercury 
deposition can range from years to decades.1 
This methodology therefore applies only to situations where air deposition is the sole 
significant source of Hg to a water body, and where the physical, chemical, and biological 
characteristics of the ecosystem remain constant over time. EPA recognizes that concentrations 
of MeHg in fish across all ecosystems may not reach steady state and that ecosystem conditions 
affecting mercury dynamics are unlikely to remain constant over time. EPA further recognizes 
that many water bodies, particularly in areas of historic gold and Hg mining in western states,

 As noted earlier in Section 5.1,monetized benefits estimates are for an immediate change in MeHg levels in fish 
(i.e., the potential lag period associated with fully realizing fish tissue MeHg levels was not reflected in benefits 
modeling). If a lag in the response of MeHg levels in fish were assumed, the monetized benefits could be 
significantly lower, depending on the length of the lag and the discount rate used.  As noted in the discussion of 
the Mercury Maps modeling, the relationship between deposition and fish tissue MeHg is proportional in 
equilibrium, but the MMaps approach does not provide any information on the time lag of response. 
 5-26 
contain significant non-air sources of Hg. Finally, EPA recognizes that MMaps does not provide 
for a calculation of the time lag between a reduction in Hg deposition and a reduction in the 
MeHg concentrations in fish. While acknowledging these limitations, EPA is unaware of any 
other tool for performing a national-scale assessment of the change in fish MeHg concentrations 
resulting from reductions in atmospheric deposition of Hg. The following paragraphs provide 
additional details on the above limitations, as well as a brief assessment of the degree to which 
conditions match those assumptions. The MMaps model (US EPA, 2001a) assumes that for long-
term steady-state conditions, reductions in fish tissue concentrations are expected to track 
linearly with reductions in air deposition watershed loads. 
The MMaps model represents a reduced form of the IEM-2M and MCM models used in 
the Mercury Study Report to Congress (USEPA, 1997), as well as the subsequent Dynamic 
MCM (D-MCM) model (Harris et al., 1996). That is, the equations of these mercury fate and 
transport models are reduced to steady state and consolidated into a single equilibrium equation 
equating the ratio of future/current air deposition rates to future/current fish tissue 
concentrations. At certain sites, the MMaps model has been shown to produce results equivalent 
to those of these complex models over the long term, under a specific set of conditions. 
Though plainly stated, the steady-state assumption is a compilation of a number of individual 
conditions. For example, fish tissue data may not represent average, steady-state concentrations 
for two major reasons: 
 Fish tissue and deposition rate data for the base period are not at steady state. Where 
deposition rates have recently changed, the watershed or waterbody may not have had 
sufficient time to fully respond. The pool of mercury in different media could be 
sufficiently large relative to release rates, and thus needs more time to achieve a new 
equilibrium. This is more likely to occur in deeper lakes and lakes with large catchments 
where turnover rates are longer and where the watershed provides significant inputs of 
mercury. 
 Fish tissue data do not represent average conditions (or conditions of interest for forecast 
fish levels). Methylation and bioaccumulation are variable and dynamic processes. If fish 
are sampled during a period of high or low methylation or bioaccumulation, they would 
not be representative of the average, steady-state or dynamic equilibrium conditions of 
the waterbody. This effect is significantly more pronounced in small and juvenile fish. 
Examples include tissue data collected during a drought or during conditions of fish 
starvation. Other examples include areas in which seasonal fluctuations in fish mercury 
levels are significant due, for example, from seasonal runoff of contaminated soils from 
 5-27 
abandoned gold and mercury mines or areas geologically rich in mercury. In such a case, 
MMaps predictions would be valid for similar conditions (e.g. wet year/dry year, or 
season) in the future, rather than typical or average conditions. Alternatively, sufficient 
fish tissue would need to be collected to get an average concentration that represents a 
baseline dynamic equilibrium. 
Other ecosystem conditions might cause projections from the MMaps approach to be 
inaccurate for a particular ecosystem. Watershed and waterbody conditions can undergo 
significant changes in capacity to transport, methylate, and bioaccumulate mercury. Examples of 
this include regions where sulfate and/or acid deposition rates are changing (in turn affecting 
MeHg production independently of total mercury loading), and where the trophic status of a 
waterbody is changing. A number of other water quality parameters have been correlated with 
increased fish tissue concentrations (e.g. low pH, high DOC, lower algal concentrations), but 
these relationships are highly variable among different waterbodies. MMaps will be biased when 
waterbody characteristics change between when fish were initially sampled, and the new 
conditions of the waterbody. 
As stated above, the relationship between the change in mercury deposition from air to 
the change in fish tissue concentration holds only when air deposition is the predominant source 
of the mercury load to a waterbody. Due to this requirement in the model, the national 
application of the MMaps approach screened out those watersheds that either contained active 
gold mines or had other substantial non-US EGU anthropogenic releases of mercury. 
Identification of watersheds with gold mines was based on a 2005 USGS data set characterizing 
mineral and metal operations in the United States. The data represent commodities monitored by 
the National Minerals Information Center of the USGS, and the operations included are those 
considered active in 2003 (online link: http://tin.er.usgs.gov/mineplant/). The identification of 
watersheds with substantial non-EGU anthropogenic emissions was based on a TRI-net query for 
2008 of non-EGU mercury sources with total annual on-site Hg emissions (all media) of 39.7 
pounds or more. This threshold value corresponds to the 25th percentile annual US-EGU 
mercury emission value as characterized in the 2005 NATA. EPA considered the 25th percentile 
US-EGU emission level to be a reasonable screen for additional substantial non-US EGU 
releases to a given watershed. 
It should be noted that MMaps was designed to address an important, but very specific 
issue – that of eventual response of fish tissue to air deposition reductions. As such it responds to 
a need to understand how mercury reductions, independent of other changes in the environment, 
will impact fish contamination and human health. More complex models are required in cases 
 5-28 
where more complete descriptions are needed. A dynamic model is essential for modeling 
waterbody recovery during the period in which waterbody response lags reductions in mercury 
loads. A dynamic model is also essential for understanding seasonal fluctuations, as well as year-
to-year fluctuations due to meteorological variability. Finally, a more complex model would be 
essential for assessing the impact of other watershed and water quality changes (e.g. erosion, 
wetlands coverage, and acid deposition) that might affect mercury bioaccumulation in fish. 
These complex models are used to derive the MMaps approach, and are themselves based on a 
number of assumptions. While these assumptions are considered reasonable given the state of the 
science of environmental modeling and mercury in the environment, the validity of assumptions 
inherent in both the MMaps approach and dynamic ecosystem scale models will need to be 
reevaluated as the science of mercury fate and transport evolves. 
The MMaps methodology was peer reviewed by a set of national experts in the fate and 
transport of mercury in watersheds (US EPA, 2001a). While two reviewers felt it could be used 
to predict future fish tissue concentrations, a third cautioned it should not be considered a robust 
predictor until scientific data can be generated to validate the approach. Reviewers 
systematically identified a set of implicit assumptions that compose the steady state assumption 
in the MMaps approach. They pointed out that due to evolving and complex nature of the science 
of mercury, some features of the complex models are assumptions themselves, and thus cannot 
be wholly relied upon as ultimate predictors of mercury fate and transport. The reviewers pointed 
out that there is limited scientific information to directly verify this approach, and that some 
scientific data appears to refute individual components of the overall steady state assumption. 
One reviewer did perform a D-MCM and MMaps comparison, and found that, under these 
assumptions, MMaps model did produce comparable steady-state results as the D-MCM model. 
There was considerable discussion about how best to aggregate the data, to scale up to a 
deposition reduction requirement, from fish-specific and waterbody specific information. The 
description of the approach and the methodologies as applied in this analysis are largely 
consistent with the peer review recommendations. 
The MMaps report (US EPA, 2001a) presented a national-scale application of Mercury 
Maps to determine the percent reductions in air deposition that would be needed in watersheds 
across the country for average fish tissue concentrations to achieve the national MeHg criterion. 
In this national-scale assessment, fish tissue concentrations were aggregated at the scale of large 
watersheds, thus presenting average results for each watershed. The use of other scales of 
aggregation, e.g., waterbody specific, is consistent with the MMaps approach to the degree to 
which different mercury loads can be discerned.

5.5.2 The Science of Mercury Processes and Variability in Aquatic Ecosystems 
The set of physical, chemical, and biological processes controlling mercury fate in 
watersheds and water bodies can be grouped into specific categories: mercury cycle chemistry; 
mercury processes in the atmosphere, soils and water; bioavailability of mercury in water; and 
mercury accumulation in the food web. The following is a review of these categories, discussing 
the related scientific developments that have added to our understanding of mercury processes. 
This review builds upon the work previously summarized in EPA‘s Mercury Report to Congress 
(USEPA, 1997). 
Mercury Cycle Chemistry 
Mercury occurs naturally in the environment as several different chemical species. The 
majority of mercury in the atmosphere (95-97%) is present in a neutral, elemental state (Hg
0
) 
(Lin and Pehkonen, 1999), while in water, sediments and soils the majority of mercury is found 
in the oxidized, divalent state (Hg(II)) (Morel et al., 1998). A small fraction (percent) of this pool 
of divalent mercury is transformed by microbes into MeHg (CH3Hg(II)/ MeHg) (Jackson, 1998). 
MeHg is retained in fish tissue and is the only form of mercury that biomagnifies in aquatic food 
webs (Kidd et al., 1995). As a result, MeHg concentrations in higher trophic level organisms 
such as piscivorous fish, birds and wildlife are often 104-106 times higher than aqueous MeHg 
concentrations (Jackson, 1998). Transformations among mercury species within and between 
environmental media result in a complicated chemical cycle. Mercury emissions from both 
natural and anthropogenic sources are predominantly as Hg(II) species and Hg
0
 (Landis and 
Keeler, 2002; Seigneur et al., 2004). Anthropogenic point sources of mercury consist of 
combustion (e.g., utility boilers, municipal waste combustors, commercial/industrial boilers, 
medical waste incinerators) and manufacturing sources (e.g., chlor-alkali, cement, pulp and paper 
manufacturing) (USEPA, 1997). Natural sources of mercury arise from geothermic emissions 
such as crustal degassing in the deep ocean and volcanoes as well as dissolution of mercury from 
geologic sources (Rasmussen, 1994). 
Mercury Processes in the Atmosphere 
The relative contributions of local, regional and long range sources of mercury to fish 
mercury levels in a given water body are strongly affected by the speciation of natural and 
anthropogenic emissions sources. Elemental mercury is oxidized in the atmosphere to form the 
more soluble mercuric ion (Hg(II)) (Schroeder et al., 1989). Particulate and reactive gaseous 
phases of Hg(II) are the principle forms of mercury deposited onto terrestrial and aquatic systems 
because they are more efficiently scavenged from the atmosphere through wet and dry deposition 
than Hg0 (Lindberg and Stratton, 1998). Because Hg(II) species or reactive gaseous mercury 
 5-30 
(RGM) and particulate mercury (Hg(p)) in the atmosphere tend to be deposited more locally than 
Hg
0
, differences in the species of mercury emitted affect whether it is deposited locally or travels 
longer distances in the atmosphere (Landis et al., 2004). 
Mercury Processes in Soils 
A portion of the mercury deposited in terrestrial systems is re-emitted to the atmosphere. 
On soil surfaces, sunlight may reduce deposited Hg(II) to Hg
0
, which may then evade back to the 
atmosphere (Carpi and Lindberg, 1997; Frescholtz and Gustin, 2004; Scholtz et al., 2003). 
Significant amounts of mercury can be co-deposited to soil surfaces in throughfall and litterfall 
of forested ecosystems (St. Louis et al., 2001), and exchange of gaseous Hg
0
 by vegetation has 
been observed (e.g., (Gustin et al., 2004). 
Hg(II) has a strong affinity for organic compounds such that inorganic Hg in soils and 
wetlands is predominantly bound to dissolved organic matter (Mierle and Ingram, 1991). MeHg 
likewise forms stable complexes with solid and dissolved organic matter (Hintelmann and Evans, 
1997). These complexes can dominate MeHg speciation under aerobic conditions (Karlsson and 
Skyllberg, 2003). Truly dissolved and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-complexed Hg(II) and 
MeHg are transported by percolation to shallow groundwater, and by runoff to adjacent surface 
waters (Ravichandran, 2004). Sorbed Hg(II) and MeHg are transported by erosion fluxes to 
depositional areas on the watershed and to adjacent surface waters (e.g., (Hurley et al., 1998). 
Concentrations of MeHg in soils are generally very low. In contrast, wetlands are areas of 
enhanced MeHg production and account for a significant fraction of the external MeHg inputs to 
surface waters that have watersheds with a large portion of wetland coverage (e.g., St. Louis et 
al., 2001). Accordingly, there is a positive relationship between MeHg yield and percent wetland 
coverage (Hurley et al., 1995). Hydrology exerts an important control on the magnitude and flux 
of MeHg in wetland ecosystems (Branfireun and Roulet, 2002), as well as the transport of 
inorganic mercury deposited in a given watershed to surface waters (Babiarz et al., 2001). 
Mercury Processes in Water 
In a water body, deposited Hg(II) is reduced to Hg
0
 by ultraviolet and visible 
wavelengths of sunlight as well as microbially mediated reduction pathways (Amyot et al., 2000; 
Mason et al., 1995). In turn, Hg
0
 is oxidized back to Hg(II), driven by sunlight as well as by 
―dark‖ chemical or biochemical processes (Lalonde et al., 2001; Zhang and Lindberg, 2001). 
Driven by wind and water currents, dissolved Hg
0
 in the water column is volatilized, which can 
be a significant removal mechanism for mercury in surface waters and a net source of mercury to 
the atmosphere (Siciliano et al., 2002). 
 5-31 
In the water column and sediments, Hg(II) partitions strongly to silts and biotic solids, 
sorbs weakly to sands, and complexes strongly with dissolved and particulate organic material. 
The abundance of various inorganic ligands (e.g., OH
-
, Cl
-
, S
2
-, DOC) in freshwater and 
saltwater ecosystems plays an important role in both oxidation and reduction of inorganic 
mercury as well as its bioavailability to methylating microbes. For example, reduction of Hg(II) 
is hypothesized to be a function of the predominance of Hg(OH)2, which is inversely correlated 
with pH (Mason et al., 1995). Reduction of Hg(II) to Hg
0
 and subsequent volatilization from the 
water column is important because it effectively reduces the pool of inorganic mercury that could 
potentially undergo conversion to MeHg. 
Hg(II) and MeHg sorbed to solids settle out of the water column and accumulate on the 
surface of the benthic sediment layer. Surficial sediments interact with the water column via 
resuspension and bioturbation. The burial of sediments below the surficial zone can be a 
significant removal mechanism for contaminants in surface sediments (e.g., Gobas et al., 1998; 
Gobas et al., 1995). The depth of the active sediment layer is a highly sensitive parameter for 
predicting the temporal response of different ecosystems to changes in mercury loading in 
environmental fate models. This is because the reservoir of Hg(II) potentially available for 
conversion to MeHg in the sediments is a function of the depth and volume of the active 
sediment layer. The compartment conducive for methylation is similarly affected (Harris and 
Hutchison, 2003; Sunderland et al., 2004). Physical characteristics of different ecosystem types 
affect estuarine mixing and sediment resuspension, which also affect the production of MeHg in 
the water and sediments (Rolfhus et al., 2003; Sunderland et al., 2004; Tseng et al., 2001). 
Bioavailability of Inorganic Mercury to Methylating Microbes 
The amount of bioavailable MeHg in water and sediments of aquatic systems is a 
function of the relative rates of mercury methylation and demethylation. In the water, MeHg is 
degraded by two microbial processes and sunlight (Barkay et al., 2003; Sellers et al., 1996). 
Recent research has shown that demethylating Hg-resistant bacteria may adapt to systems that 
are highly contaminated with total mercury, helping to explain the paradox of low MeHg and 
fish Hg levels in these systems (Schaefer et al., 2004). 
Mass balances for a variety of lakes and coastal ecosystems show that in situ production 
of MeHg is often one of the main sources of MeHg in the water and sediments (Benoit et al., 
1998; Bigham and Vandal, 1994; Gbundgo-Tugbawa and Driscoll, 1998; Gilmour et al., 1998; 
Mason et al., 1999). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are thought to be the principle agents 
responsible for the majority of MeHg production in aquatic systems (Beyers et al., 1999; 
 5-32 
Compeau and Bartha, 1987; Gilmour and Henry, 1991). SRB thrive in the redoxocline, where the 
maximum gradient between oxic and anoxic conditions exists (Hintelmann et al., 2000). Thus, in 
addition to the presence of bioavailable Hg(II), MeHg production and accumulation in aquatic 
systems is a function of the geochemical parameters that enhance or inhibit the activity of 
methylating microbes, especially sulfur concentrations, redox potential (Eh) and the composition 
and availability of organic carbon. 
A number of factors affect the bioavailabilty of Hg(II). A strong inverse relationship 
between complexation of Hg(II) by sulfides and MeHg production has been demonstrated in a 
number of studies (Benoit et al., 1999a; Benoit et al., 1999b; Craig and Bartlett, 1978; Craig and 
Moreton, 1986). Passive diffusion of dissolved, neutral inorganic mercury species is 
hypothesized as one of the main modes of entry across the cell membranes of methylating 
microbes (Benoit et al., 1999a; Benoit et al., 2003; Benoit et al., 1999b). Thus, the formation of 
neutral, dissolved mercury species such as HgCl2, Hg(OH)2, HgClOH, and HgS
0
(aq.), which 
depend on the availability of constituent ligands in the surface and interstitial waters, may 
strongly influence the availability of inorganic mercury to SRB, although our understanding of 
the forms of mercury that are bioavailable to methylating microbes is currently incomplete 
(Benoit et al., 2001; Benoit et al., 1999a; King et al., 2001). See Section 5.7.5.1 below for 
additional detail on the relationship between sulfur deposition and mercury methylation. 
Changes in the bioavailability of inorganic mercury and the activity of methylating 
microbes as a function of sulfur, carbon and ecosystem specific characteristics mean that 
ecosystem changes and anthropogenic ―stresses‖ that do not result in a direct increase in mercury 
loading to the ecosystem but alter the rate of MeHg formation may also affect mercury levels in 
organisms (Grieb et al., 1990). Because mercury concentrations in fish can increase even when 
there has been no change in the total amount of mercury deposited in the ecosystem, 
environmental changes such as eutrophication, which may alter microbial activity and the 
chemical dynamics of mercury within an ecosystem, must be considered together with emission 
control strategies to effectively manage mercury accumulation in the food web. 
Recent research indicates that the bioavailability or reactivity of newly deposited Hg(II) 
may be greater than older ―legacy‖ mercury in the system (Hintelmann et al., 2002). These 
results suggest that lakes receiving the bulk of their mercury directly from deposition to the lake 
surface (e.g., some seepage lakes) would see fish mercury concentrations respond more rapidly 
to changes in atmospheric deposition than lakes receiving most of their mercury from watershed 
runoff. The implications of these data are also that systems with a greater surface area to 
watershed area ratio that receive most of their inputs directly from the atmosphere (e.g., seepage 
 5-33 
lakes) may respond more rapidly to changes in emissions and deposition of mercury than those 
receiving significant inputs of mercury from the catchment area. 
Sulfur and Mercury Methylation 
EPA‘s 2008 Integrated Science Assessment (ISA) for Oxides of Nitrogen and Sulfur–
Ecological Criteria (Final Report) concluded that evidence is sufficient to infer a casual 
relationship between sulfur deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands and 
aquatic environments. Specifically, there appears to be a relationship between SO4
2-
 deposition 
and mercury methylation; however, the rate of mercury methylation varies according to several 
spatial and biogeochemical factors whose influence has not been fully quantified (see Figure 5-
2). Therefore, the correlation between SO4
2-
 deposition and MeHg could not be quantified for the 
purpose of interpolating the association across waterbodies or regions. Nevertheless, because 
changes in MeHg in ecosystems represent changes in significant human and ecological health 
risks, the association between sulfur and mercury cannot be neglected (EPA, 2008, Sections 
3.4.1 and 4.5). 
Figure 5-2. Spatial and Biogeochemical Factors Influencing MeHg Production 
 
 5-34 
As research evolves and the computational capacity of models expands to meet the 
complexity of mercury methylation processes in ecosystems, the role of interacting factors may 
be better parsed out to identify ecosystems or regions that are more likely to generate higher 
concentrations of MeHg. Figure 5-3 illustrates the type of current and forward-looking research 
being developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to synthesize the contributing factors of 
mercury and to develop a map of sensitive watersheds. The mercury score referenced in 
Figure 5-3 is based on SO4
2-
 concentrations, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), levels of 
dissolved organic carbon and pH, mercury species concentrations, and soil types to gauge the 
methylation sensitivity (Myers et al., 2007). 
Interdependent biogeochemical factors preclude the existence of simple sulfate-related 
mercury methylation models (see Figure 5-3). It is clear that decreasing sulfate deposition is 
likely to result in decreased MeHg concentrations. Future research may allow for the 
characterization of a usable sulfate-MeHg response curve; however, no regional or classification 
calculation scale can be created at this time because of the number of confounding factors. 
Figure 5-3. Preliminary USGS Map of Mercury Methylation–Sensitive Watersheds Derived 
from More than 55,000 Water Quality Sites and 2,500 Watersheds (Myers et al., 2007) 
 
Decreases in SO4
2-
 deposition have already shown promising reductions in MeHg. 
Observed decreases in MeHg fish tissue concentrations have been linked to decreased 
 5-35 
acidification and declining SO4
2-
 and mercury deposition in Little Rock Lake, WI (Hrabik and 
Watras, 2002), and to decreased SO4
2-
 deposition in Isle Royale in Lake Superior, MI (Drevnick 
et al., 2007). Although the possibility exists that reductions in SO4
2-
 emissions could generate a 
pulse in MeHg production because of decreased sulfide inhibition in sulfate-saturated waters, 
this effect would likely involve a limited number of U.S. waters (Harmon et al., 2007). Also, 
because of the diffusion and outward flow of both mercurysulfide complexes and SO4
2-
, 
increased mercury methylation downstream may still occur in sulfate-enriched ecosystems with 
increased organic matter and/or downstream transport capabilities. 
Remediation of sediments heavily contaminated with mercury has yielded significant 
reductions of MeHg in biotic tissues. Establishing quantitative relations in biotic responses to 
MeHg levels as a result of changes in atmospheric mercury deposition, however, presents 
difficulties because direct associations can be confounded by all of the factors discussed in this 
section. Current research does suggest that the levels of MeHg and total mercury in ecosystems 
are positively correlated, so that reductions in mercury deposited into ecosystems would also 
eventually lead to reductions in MeHg in biotic tissues. Ultimately, an integrated approach that 
involves the reduction of both sulfur and mercury emissions may be most efficient because of the 
variability in ecosystem responses. Reducing SOX emissions could have a beneficial effect on 
levels of MeHg in many waters of the United States. 
Mercury Accumulation in the Food Web 
Dissolved Hg(II) and MeHg accumulate in aquatic vegetation, phytoplankton, and 
benthic invertebrates. Unlike Hg(II), MeHg biomagnifies though each successive trophic level in 
both benthic and pelagic food chains such that mercury in predatory, freshwater fish is found 
almost exclusively as MeHg (Bloom, 1992; Watras et al., 1998). Thus, trophic position and food-
chain complexity plays an important role in MeHg bioaccumulation (Kidd et al., 1995). The 
chemical and physical characteristics of different ecosystems affect MeHg uptake at the base of 
the food chain, driving bioaccumulation at higher trophic levels. At the base of pelagic 
freshwater food-webs, MeHg uptake by plankton is thought to be a combination of passive 
diffusion and facilitated transport (Laporte et al., 2002; Watras et al., 1998). Uptake of MeHg by 
plankton can be enhanced or inhibited by the presence of different ligands bound to MeHg 
(Lawson and Mason, 1998). Similarly, the assimilation efficiency of MeHg at the base of the 
food chain is also affected by the type of dissolved MeHg-complexes in the water and sediments. 
This may be a function of differences in the ability of organisms to solubilize MeHg through 
digestive processes with different MeHg complexes (Lawrence and Mason, 2001; Leaner and 
Mason, 2002). The presence of organic ligands and high concentrations of DOC in aquatic 
 5-36 
ecosystems are generally thought to limit MeHg uptake by biota (Driscoll et al., 1995; Sunda and 
Huntsman, 1998; Watras et al., 1998). 
In fish, MeHg bioaccumulation is a function of several uptake (diet, gills) and elimination 
pathways (excretion, growth dilution) (Gilmour et al., 1998; Greenfield et al., 2001). As a result, 
the highest mercury concentrations for a given fish species correspond to smaller, long-lived fish 
that accumulate MeHg over their life span with minimal growth dilution (e.g., (Doyon et al., 
1998). In general, higher mercury concentrations are expected in top predators, which are often 
large fish relative to other species in a waterbody. 
5.5.3 Summary 
In the United States, humans are exposed to MeHg mainly by consuming fish that contain 
MeHg. Aquatic ecosystems respond to changes in mercury deposition in a highly variable 
manner as a function of differences in their chemical, biological and physical properties. 
Depending on the characteristics of a given ecosystem, methylating microbes convert a small but 
variable fraction of the inorganic mercury in the sediments and water derived from human 
activities and natural sources into MeHg. MeHg is the only form of mercury that biomagnifies in 
the food web. Concentrations of MeHg in fish are generally on the order of a million times the 
MeHg concentration in water. In addition to mercury deposition, key factors affecting MeHg 
production and accumulation in fish include the amount and forms of sulfur and carbon species 
present in a given waterbody. Thus, two adjoining water bodies receiving the same deposition 
can have significantly different fish mercury concentrations. 
For this analysis, EPA used the Mercury Maps (MMaps) model to estimate changes in 
freshwater fish mercury concentrations resulting from changes in mercury deposition after 
regulation of mercury emissions from U.S. coal-fired power plants. MMaps, a simplified form of 
the IEM-2M model applied in EPA‘s 1997 Mercury Study Report to Congress, is a static model 
that assumes a proportional relationship between declines in atmospheric mercury deposition and 
concentrations in fish at steady state. This means, for example, that a 50% decrease in mercury 
deposition rates is projected to lead to a 50% decrease in mercury concentrations in fish. MMaps 
does not consider the dynamics of relevant ecosystem specific factors that can affect the 
methylation and bioaccumulation in fish in different water bodies over time, nor does it consider 
the inputs of non-air sources to the watershed. In all cases, the MMaps model does not address 
the lag time of different ecosystems to reach steady state (i.e., when fish mercury concentrations 
reflect changes in atmospheric deposition). In addition, applying the MMaps model assumes that 
atmospheric deposition is the principle source of mercury to the waterbodies being investigated 
 5-37 
and environmental factors that affect MeHg production and accumulation in organisms will 
remain constant, allowing each ecosystem to reach steady state. While MMaps has several 
limitations, EPA knows of no alternative tool for performing a national-scale assessment of such 
changes.

5.7 Analysis of the Dose-Response Relationship Between Maternal Mercury Body 
Burden and Childhood IQ 
5.7.1 Introduction 
In considering possible health endpoints for quantification and monetization, EPA 
reviewed the scientific literature on the health effects of mercury, including the ―Toxicological 
Effects of Methylmercury,‖ published by the National Research Council (NRC) in 2000 (NRC, 
2000). 
EPA chose to focus on quantification of intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements associated 
with prenatal mercury exposure as the initial endpoint for quantification and valuation of 
mercury health benefits. Reasons for this initial focus on IQ included the availability of 
thoroughly-reviewed, high-quality epidemiological studies assessing IQ or related cognitive 
outcomes suitable for IQ estimation, and the availability of well-established methods and data for 
economic valuation of avoided IQ deficits, as applied in EPA‘s previous benefits analyses for 
childhood lead exposure. 
Epidemiological studies of prenatal mercury exposure conducted in the Faroe Islands 
(Grandjean et al., 1997), New Zealand (Kjellstrom et al., 1989; Crump et al., 1998), and the 
Seychelles Islands (Davidson et al., 1998; Myers et al., 2003) have examined 
neurodevelopmental outcomes through the administration of tests of cognitive functioning. Each 
of these studies included some but not all of the following tests: full-scale IQ, performance IQ, 
problem solving, social and adaptive behavior, language functions, motor skills, attention, 
memory and other functions. The NRC reviewed the studies and determined that ―Each of the 
studies was well designed and carefully conducted, and each examined prenatal MeHg exposures 
within the range of the general U.S. population exposures‖ (NRC, 2000). 
 5-45 
As part of previous analyses, EPA attempted to identify the appropriate dose-response 
coefficients from the Faroe Islands, New Zealand, and Seychelles Islands studies, and devised a 
statistical approach for combining those coefficients to provide an integrated estimate of the IQ 
dose-response coefficient. 
For this assessment, EPA used a more recently revised estimate of the IQ dose-response 
function, based on a peer-reviewed study by Axelrad et al. (2007) (―the Axelrad study‖). The 
Axelrad study estimated a dose-response relationship between maternal mercury body burden 
and subsequent childhood decrements in IQ using a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate data 
from the Faroe Islands, New Zealand, and Seychelles Islands studies. 
The Axelrad study used a linear model that goes through the origin to fit population-level 
dose-response relationships to the pooled data from the three studies. The application of a linear 
model should not be interpreted to suggest that any of the three studies used have data showing 
health effects from MeHg exposure at or below the RfD. The RfD is an estimate of a daily 
exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an 
appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime (EPA, 2002). EPA believes that 
exposures at or below the RfD are unlikely to be associated with appreciable risk of deleterious 
effects. It is important to note, however, that the RfD does not define an exposure level 
corresponding to zero risk; mercury exposure near or below the RfD could pose a very low level 
of risk which EPA deems to be non-appreciable. It is also important to note that the RfD does not 
define a bright line, above which individuals are necessarily at risk of adverse effect. Use of a 
linear model that goes through the origin, rather than one that reflects a threshold effect is 
technically more simple and practical. It associates an increment of IQ benefit with a given 
reduction in exposure. A linear model allows us to estimate the benefits of reductions in 
exposure due to power plants without a complete assessment of other sources of exposure. Other 
models would require information on the joint distribution of exposure from power plants and 
other sources to estimate the benefits of reducing the exposure due to power plants, which would 
require much more precise information about consumption patterns. 
5.7.2 Epidemiological Studies of Mercury and Neurodevelopmental Effects 
The IQ dose-response estimate is based on data from three major prospective studies 
investigating potential neurotoxicity of low-level, chronic mercury exposure: the Faroe Islands 
study, the New Zealand study, and the Seychelles Child Development Study. 
In assembling the New Zealand sample, Kjellstrom et al. (1989) ascertained the fish 
consumption of 10,930 of 16,293 pregnant women in the study area. They identified 935 women 
 5-46 
who reportedly consumed fish at least 3 times per week. Hair samples were obtained from these 
women, and 73 were found to have a hair mercury level of 6 parts per million (ppm) or greater. 
In this group, the mean was 8.3 ppm, with a range of 6 to 86 ppm, although only one woman had 
a level greater than 20 ppm. Each woman with 6 ppm hair mercury or greater was matched to 3 
controls - one with hair mercury between 3-6 ppm, one with hair mercury less than 3 ppm and 
high fish consumption, and one with hair mercury less than 3 ppm and low fish consumption. 
Ethnic group, age, smoking, residence time in New Zealand, and child sex were also used to 
select controls. The final study group included 237 children, including 57 fully matched sets of 4 
children. Although children were assessed at 4 and 6 years of age, only the data collected at the 
older age is considered in this analysis, as the reliability and validity of neurodevelopmental 
testing generally increases with child age. 
The Faroe Islands investigators assembled a birth cohort of 1,353 newborns recruited 
from three hospitals over a 21-month period in 1986-1987. In 1,022 women, two biomarkers of 
prenatal mercury exposure were collected: cord-blood mercury, and maternal hair mercury at 
delivery. Neurodevelopmental assessments of 917 children were conducted at age 7 (Grandjean 
et al., 1997). For these 917 children, the geometric mean concentration of mercury in cord-blood 
was 22.6 parts per billion (ppb) (inter-quartile range 13.1 – 40.5 ppb, full range 0.9 – 351 ppb). 
The geometric mean concentration of mercury in maternal hair was 4.2 ppm (inter-quartile 
range: 2.5-7.7 ppm, full range 0.2 – 39.1 ppm) (Budtz-Jorgensen et al., 2004a). 
Neurodevelopmental assessments of the children were conducted at age 7 years (Grandjean et 
al., 1997). 
In assembling the Seychelles Child Development Study sample, investigators obtained 
hair samples from 779 pregnant women and ultimately enrolled a study sample consisting of 740 
newborns. The mean maternal hair mercury level was 6.8 ppm (range 0.9-25.8 ppm) (Davidson 
et al., 1998). Neurodevelopmental assessments were conducted when the children were 6.5, 19, 
29, and 66 months, and at 9 years. The mean maternal hair mercury level for the 643 children 
who participated in the assessment at age 9 years was 6.9 ppm (standard deviation 4.5 ppm) 
(Myers et al., 2003). 
5.7.3 Statistical Analysis 
Previous statistical analysis conducted by Ryan (2005) produced a dose-response 
relationship, integrating data from all three studies, with a central estimate of an IQ change of -
0.13 IQ points (95% confidence interval -0.28, -0.03) for every ppm of mercury in maternal hair. 
Axelrad et al. (2007) conducted a more recent statistical analysis integrating data from the Faroe 
 5-47 
Islands, New Zealand, and Seychelles Islands studies to produce a single estimate of the IQ dose-
response relationship, which is used in this RIA. Additional details of the analysis are reported in 
the Axelrad study and in its Supplemental Material (available at 
http://www.ehponline.org/docs/2007/9303/suppl.pdf). The information is summarized below. 
The Axelrad study used a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to estimate the 
integrated dose-response coefficient. This is similar to the approach used by the NRC panel to 
calculate a benchmark dose value integrating data from all three studies (NRC, 2000). The model 
makes use of dose-response coefficients for IQ, and also considered all other cognitive endpoints 
reported in the three studies in an effort to obtain more robust estimates of the IQ relationship 
that account for within-study (endpoint-to-endpoint) variability as well as variability across 
studies. 
The Axelrad study assumed a linear relationship between mercury body burdens and 
neurodevelopmental outcomes, in keeping with the recommendation of the NRC committee 
(NRC, 2000). In the New Zealand and Seychelles Islands studies, all information necessary for 
the model was obtained from the published papers, including linear regression coefficients 
(Crump et al., 1998; Myers et al., 2003). The Faroe Islands publications, however, reported 
results with cord blood and maternal hair mercury transformed to the log scale and provided no 
results of linear models (Grandjean et al., 1997, 1999). A report by the Faroe Islands 
investigators (Budtz-Jorgensen et al., 2005) provided the additional details needed for the 
analysis. 
The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC) is a standard test of childhood IQ 
that was used in each of the three studies. The version of the test administered in the Seychelles 
Islands (3rd ed.; WISC-III) was different from the earlier version used in New Zealand and the 
Faroe Islands (revised ed.; WISC-R). In a sample of approximately 200 children, the correlation 
between the Full-Scale IQ scores for the two versions was 0.89; thus the WISC-R and WISC-III 
appear to measure the same constructs and generate scores with similar dispersion (Wechsler, 
1991). 
The WISC-R includes 10 core subtests and three supplementary subtests. For the Faroe 
Islands study, the investigators administered only three subtests of the WISC-R: Digit Span and 
Similarities (core subtests) and Block Design (a supplementary subtest). The Axelrad study used 
data for these three subtests to estimate an IQ–mercury coefficient for the Faroe Islands cohort. 
The Faroe Islands investigators fit data for these three subtests in a structural equation model 
(SEM) to estimate a standardized coefficient for a hypothetical Full-Scale IQ (Budtz-Jorgensen 
 5-48 
et al., 2005). In the SEM analysis of IQ, the three WISC-R subtests are viewed as representative 
of an underlying latent IQ variable. 
To estimate the association between mercury and IQ using information from the three 
studies, the Axelrad study used a hierarchical random-effects model that includes study-to-study 
as well as endpoint–to–endpoint variability. Axelrad et al. (2007) implemented the model with a 
Bayesian approach, using WinBUGS version 1.4 (http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/). 
Although the Axelrad study‘s Bayesian analysis yields highest posterior density (HPD) intervals, 
the authors refer to these as confidence intervals to aid in the interpretation of results (Axelrad et 
al., 2007). 
The integrated analysis produced a central estimate of -0.18 (95% CI, -0.378 to -0.009) 
IQ points for each part per million maternal hair mercury, similar to the results found for both the 
Faroe Islands and Seychelles studies, and lower than the estimate found in the New Zealand 
study. This central estimate was used as the basis for estimating IQ loss associated with prenatal 
MeHg exposure in this assessment. 
5.7.4 Strengths and Limitations of the IQ Dose-Response Analysis 
The Axelrad study produced an estimate of the relationship between maternal mercury 
body burdens during pregnancy and childhood IQs that incorporates data from all three 
epidemiologic studies judged by the NRC to be of high quality and suitable for risk assessment. 
The statistical approach makes use of all the available data (including information on results for 
related tests of cognitive function), and can be used to produce population-based estimates of a 
health outcome that can be readily monetized for use in benefit-cost analysis.1 
There are several aspects of IQ as a metric for neurodevelopmental effects in this benefit-
cost analysis that are important to recognize. Full-Scale IQ is a composite index that averages a 
child‘s performance across many functional domains, providing a good overall picture of 
cognitive health. An extensive body of data documents the predictive validity of full-scale IQ, as 
measured at school age, and late outcomes such as academic and occupational success (Neisser 
et al., 1996). In addition, methods are readily available for valuing shifts in IQ and thus 
conducting a benefits analysis of interventions that shift the IQ distribution in a population. 
                                                 
1 There is limited evidence directly linking IQ and methylmercury exposure in the three large epidemiological 
studies that were evaluated by the NAS and EPA. Based on its evaluation of the three studies, EPA believes that 
children who are prenatally exposed to low concentrations of methylmercury may be at increased risk of poor 
performance on neurobehavioral tests, such as those measuring attention, fine motor function, language skills, 
visual-spatial abilities (like drawing), and verbal memory. For this analysis, EPA is adopting IQ as a surrogate for 
the neurobehavioral endpoints that NAS and EPA relied upon for the RfD. 
 5-49 
Methods for monetization of the other tests administered in the three studies have not been 
developed. 
It is important to recognize, however, that full-scale IQ might not be the cognitive 
endpoint that is most sensitive to prenatal mercury exposure. Significant inverse associations 
were found, in both the New Zealand and Faroe Islands studies, between prenatal mercury levels 
and neurobehavioral endpoints other than IQ. If the effects of mercury are highly focal, affecting 
only specific cognitive functions, taking full-scale IQ as the primary endpoint for a benefits 
analysis might underestimate the impacts. In averaging performance over diverse functions in 
order to compute full-scale IQ, the specific effects of mercury on only certain of these functions 
would be ―diluted,‖ and the estimated magnitude of the change in performance per unit change in 
the mercury biomarker would be underestimated. 
Moreover, it is well known that there may be substantial deficits in cognitive wellbeing 
even in individuals with normal or above average IQ. The criterion most frequently used to 
identify children with learning disabilities for the purposes of assignment to special education 
services is a discrepancy between IQ and achievement. Specifically, the child‘s achievement in 
reading, math, or other academic areas is significantly lower than what would be expected, given 
his or her full-scale IQ. Thus, there are deficits in cognitive functioning that are not captured by 
IQ scores. For example, two of the most sensitive endpoints in the Faroe Islands study were the 
Boston Naming Test, which assesses word retrieval, and the California Verbal Learning Test-
Children, which assesses the acquisition and retention of information presented verbally. 
Depending on the severity of the deficits, a child who has deficits in either of these skills could 
be at a considerable disadvantage in the classroom setting and at substantial educational risk. 
Neither of these abilities is directly assessed by the WISC-R or WISC-III, however, and so do 
not explicitly contribute to a child‘s IQ score. Therefore, benefits calculations relying solely on 
IQ decrements are likely to underestimate the benefits to cognitive functioning of reduced 
mercury exposures. In additions, impacts on other neurological domains (such as motor skills 
and attention/behavior) are not represented by IQ scores and thus are also excluded from the 
benefits analysis. 
As discussed above, the Faroe Islands study did not include testing for full-scale IQ. For 
the Axelrad study, an estimate of a dose-response coefficient for full-scale IQ was estimated 
using the three subtests. While this extrapolation introduces some uncertainty, information has 
been presented that demonstrates a high correlation between the subtests and full-scale IQ scores. 
 5-50 
While the Seychelles and New Zealand studies use maternal hair mercury as the exposure 
biomarker, the Faroe Islands study uses cord blood mercury. For purposes of the integrated 
analysis, it was necessary to express results from all three studies in the same terms. Several 
studies have examined the relationship between hair mercury and blood mercury, and have 
reported hair:blood ratios typically in the range of 200 to 300 (see ATSDR 1999, pages 249-252 
for a review). However, these studies generally do not use cord blood mercury, which is the 
exposure metric in the Faroe Islands study. One analysis found that mercury concentrations in 
cord blood are, on average, 70 percent higher than those in maternal blood (Stern and Smith, 
2003). For conversion of Faroe Islands data from cord blood mercury to maternal hair mercury, 
the Axelrad study used data specific to this population, indicating a median maternal hair:cord 
blood mercury ratio of 200 (Budtz-Jorgensen et al., 2004a). 
One uncertainty concerning the New Zealand study is the strong influence of one child in 
the study population with a particularly high maternal hair mercury level. Published analyses of 
the New Zealand study presented results with data for this child both included and excluded 
(Crump et al., 1998). In keeping with the conclusions of the NRC (2000), the integrated dose-
response analysis in the Axelrad study made use of the dose-response coefficients calculated 
with this child omitted. A sensitivity analysis using the New Zealand coefficient with this child 
included results in an integrated dose-response coefficient that is reduced in magnitude by 25 
percent (-0.125 versus a primary central estimate of -0.18). 
Some uncertainty is also associated with the Seychelles study due to the exclusion of 
some members of the cohort from the data reported by Myers et al. (2003) and used as input to 
this integrated dose-response analysis. The Seychelles researchers did not include a small 
number of outliers (defined as observations with model residuals exceeding 3 standard deviation 
units), and no results are available for the full cohort. However, the authors report that ―In all 
cases, the association between prenatal MeHg exposure and the endpoint was the same, 
irrespective of whether outliers were included‖ (Myers et al., 2003). 
Finally, the integrated dose-response analysis assumes the exposures assigned to each 
study subject are accurate representations of true exposure. In reality, there is likely to be some 
discrepancy between measured and actual exposures, for example, due to variation in hair length. 
Alternatively, the true exposure of interest may have been during the first trimester of pregnancy, 
whereas exposures in maternal hair and cord blood measured at birth reflect exposures later in 
pregnancy. Presence of exposure measurement error could introduce a bias in the results, most 
likely towards the null (Budtz-Jorgensen et al., 2004b). 
 5-51 
5.7.5 Possible Confounding from Long-Chained Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids 
Maternal consumption of fish during pregnancy exposes the fetus to long-chain 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), believed to be beneficial for fetal brain development, 
and to the neurotoxicant MeHg (Helland et al., 2003; Daniels et al., 2004; Dunstan et al., 2006; 
Judge et al., 2007). Reports from the Seychelles Islands study cohort have suggested a negative 
impact of MeHg exposure, accompanied by a simultaneous beneficial effect of omega-3 
LCPUFAs on children‘s development (Davidson et al., 2008; Strain et al., 2008). It is unclear 
whether this result was evidence for independent influences of MeHg and LCPUFAs or effect 
modification. A recent study by Lynch et al. (2010) used varying coefficient models to 
characterize the interaction of mercury and nutritional covariates (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993), 
including omega-3 LCPUFAs, using data from the Seychelles Islands study. 
The Seychelles Islands study cohort of mother-child pairs had fish consumption 
averaging 9 meals per week. Lynch et al., (2010) assessed maternal nutritional status for five 
different nutritional covariates known to be present in fish (n-3 LCPUFA, n-6 LCPUFA, iron 
status, iodine status, and choline) and associated with children‘s neurological development. The 
study also included prenatal MeHg exposure (measured in maternal hair). 
Lynch et al., (2010) examined two child neurodevelopmental outcomes (Bayley Scales 
Infant Development-II (BSID-II) Mental Developmental Index (MDI) and Psychomotor 
Developmental Index (PDI)), each administered at 9 and at 30 months. The varying coefficient 
models allowed the possible interactions between each nutritional component and MeHg to be 
modeled as a smoothly varying function of MeHg as an effect modifier. Iron, iodine, choline, 
and omega-6 LCPUFAs had little or no observable modulation at different MeHg exposures. In 
contrast the omega-3 LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid had beneficial effects on the BSID-II PDI 
that were reduced or absent at higher MeHg exposures. The results from Lynch et al. (2010) 
suggest a potentially useful modeling method that could shed further light on the issue of 
interactions between nutritional covariates. 
A recent study by Rice et al. (2010) considered possible confounding in a probabilistic 
assessment of the health benefits of reducing MeHg exposure in the United States. In deciding on 
a dose-response relationship between MeHg exposure and effects on IQ loss, the authors chose 
to use the central estimate from the Axelrad study, noting however that Axelrad et al. (2007) did 
not explicitly consider possible confounding of the MeHg-IQ relationship by the concurrent 
consumption of LCPUFAs that might enhance cognitive development and bias downward the 
observed regression coefficient estimates from the Faroe Islands, New Zealand, and Seychelles 
 5-52 
Islands studies. Rice et al. (2010) therefore multiplied the central estimate from Axelrad et al. 
(2010) by an adjustment factor to offset the possible downward bias from inadequate confounder 
control. A factor of 1.5 was selected ―to acknowledge the recent argument of Budtz-Jorgensen et 
al. (2007) that the parameter estimates from the three epidemiological studies may be biased 
downward by a factor of approximately 2 because of failure to adequately control for 
confounding‖ (Rice et al., 2010). 
There remains uncertainty with respect to the nature and magnitude of potential 
confounding between LCPUFAs and MeHg, and the associated effects on childhood 
neurodevelopment due to maternal ingestion during pregnancy. Additional research is needed to 
provide further clarity on this issue, but recent studies such as those referenced above reinforce 
the view that fish consumption during pregnancy should be approached as a case of multiple 
exposures to nutrients and to MeHg, with a complex and potentially interactive set of risks and 
benefits related to infant development. Due to the remaining uncertainty regarding the potential 
confounding between LCPUFAs and MeHg exposure, we have not incorporated any factors or 
other quantitative adjustments into this assessment.

5.8 Mercury Benefits Analysis Modeling Methodology 
5.8.1 Introduction 
This section describes the methodology used to model fishing behavior and associated 
MeHg exposure levels. The methodology incorporates data, assumptions, and analytical 
techniques already described in previous sections. Sections 5.7.2 and 5.7.3 below describe 
elements of the methodology applied to develop a national-scale estimate of benefits associated 
with avoided IQ loss among freshwater recreational anglers. Section 5.7.4 describes a variation 
 5-55 
of the methodology used to estimate risk levels (as measured by IQ loss) among modeled high-
risk subpopulations. 
5.8.2 Estimation of Exposed Populations and Fishing Behaviors 
This section describes the methodology used to estimate the average daily ingestion of 
mercury (g/day) through noncommercial freshwater fish consumption (HgI) for selected 
populations of interest. Because the primary measurable health effect of concern—
developmental neurological abnormalities in children—occurs as a result of in-utero exposures 
to mercury, the specific population of interest in this case is prenatally exposed children. To 
identify and estimate the size of this exposed population, the benefits analysis focuses on 
pregnant women in freshwater recreational angler households. 
Generally speaking, estimating mercury exposures for this exposure pathway and 
population of interest requires three main components: 
Ni = size of the exposed population of interest i (annual number of pregnant women 
in freshwater angler households during the year), 
CHgi = average concentration (ppm) of methyl mercury in noncommercial freshwater 
fish filets consumed by population i, and 
Ci = average daily consumption rate (gm/day) of noncommercial freshwater fish by 
population i. 
The flow diagram in Figure 5-4 illustrates the approach used to estimate the first two 
components of this equation—Ni and CHgi. It shows the spatial scale of the data used to estimate 
these components and describes how these components are interrelated. For the third 
component—Ci—recommendations from EPA‘s Environmental Exposure Factors Handbook 
(EPA, 1997) were used to estimate an average consumption rate estimate for recreationally 
caught freshwater fish. 
First, 2000 Census data (U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Summary File 3, Detailed 
Tables, United States) were used to define the size, age, gender distribution, and income of the 
populations within each census tract in the 48 contiguous U.S. states.

1. Estimating the number of pregnant women (NP) living in the census tract as 
 NP = NF * fs, (5.1) 
where 
NF = number of females aged 15 to 44 in the tract (Census 2000) and 
fs = state-level general fertility rate (average number of live births in a year per 1,000 
women aged 15 to 44) (2006 Vital Statistics). 
2. Estimating the annual number of prenatally exposed children in angler households 
(NPA) as 
 NPA = NP*(NAs/Ns), (5.2) 
where 
NAs = state-level number of angler residents (FHWAR) and 
Ns = adult population of state s (Census). 
Using Eq. (5.2) to estimate NPA implies that (1) the fraction of pregnant women in a 
state who are in freshwater angler households is equal to the fraction of households in the state 
that include freshwater anglers (i.e., pregnant women are no more or less likely than the rest of 
the state population to live in households with freshwater anglers) and (2) the fraction of 
households in the state that includes freshwater anglers is equal to the fraction of adult residents 
in the state who are freshwater anglers. 
To estimate NPA for years after 2000, it was assumed that state-level fertility rates (fs) 
and angler participation rates (NAs/Ns) would remain constant; however, the number of women 
of childbearing age in each block (NF) was increased based on county-level population growth 
projections (Woods and Poole, 2008). In other words, for the period 2000 to 2016, the estimated 
NPA for each census tract was assumed to increase at the same rate as the projected annual 
population growth rates for females 15 to 44 in their corresponding counties.

Fourth, to match exposed populations in each tract with mercury concentrations, we first 
divided the exposed population into four distinct demographic groups (i = 1 – 4): urban/low 
income, urban/high income, nonurban/low income, and nonurban/high income. To estimate the 
portion of households in each demographic group (pi for i = 1 – 4), tract-level Census data were 
used to specify (1) the percentage of the population in each tract that resides in an urban area and 
(2) the percentage with household income less than $50,000 (i.e., the portion in the low-income 
group). 
In addition, it was assumed that 
1. each exposed individual in a census tract is associated with freshwater fishing in a 
single distance interval and a single waterbody type (i.e., all the fish they consume 
comes from the same distance and type of waterbody) 1, and 
2. the exposed populations in each census tract (rather than just the fishing trips) are 
distributed across the distance intervals and waterbody types according to the 
estimated proportions (i.e., parameters c, e, and p shown in Figure 5-4). 
More specifically, a maximum of 32 separate exposed subpopulations were defined for each 
census tract: 
 NPAijk = NPA * pi * eij * ck (for all i, j, and k) (5.3) 
for 
i = 1 – 4 demographic subgroup in the census tract, 
j = 1 – 4 distance interval, and 
k = lake or river. 
(See Figure 5-4 for definitions of pi, eij, and ck). 
Using this approach, we were able to separately match each subpopulation NPAijk with 
the census tract‘s average mercury concentration for the corresponding distance and waterbody 
category (CHgjk). 
                                                 
1
 An alternative would be to assume that all anglers in the census tract have the same distribution of trips across 
distance intervals and water types. This assumption would imply no variation in per-capita mercury exposures 
within a census tract, but it would not affect the estimates of total exposure and total IQ losses in the tract. 
 5-60 
To approximate the percentage freshwater fishing trips (and exposed individuals) from 
each census tract matched to each waterbody type (cl or cr), we used state-level averages. These 
averages were calculated for each state, based on the portion of residents‘ freshwater fishing trips 
that are to each waterbody type, based on 2001 FHWAR data. 
Data from NSRE 1994 were used to approximate the percentage of freshwater fishing 
trips (and exposed individuals) matched to different distances from anglers‘ residential location. 
Four distance intervals were defined as 0–10 miles, >10–20 miles, >20–50 miles, and >50–100 
miles. Based on self-reported trip distance information from nearly 2,000 respondents (see 
Appendix B for details), each of these distance categories was associated with roughly 20% of 
the reported trips in the NSRE sample. Four distinct demographic groups were also found to 
have significantly different average travel distances for freshwater fishing in the NSRE sample: 
high-income urban, high-income rural, low-income urban, and low-income rural. An annual 
household income threshold of $50,000 (in 2000 dollars) was used to define high and low 
income, because it is close to the median value for both the NSRE sample and the U.S. 
population. The portion of trips for each demographic group (i = 1 – 4) to each distance interval 
(j = 1 – 4) is defined as eij. The estimated values for eij are reported in Appendix B. 
To estimate average daily mercury ingestion rates for each exposed subpopulation n=ijk, 
we applied the following equation: 
 HgIn = CHgFCn* Cn= (CHgn* CCF) * Cn (5.4) 
where 
HgI = average daily mercury ingestion rate (μg/day); 
CHg = average mercury concentration in uncooked freshwater fish (ppm); 
CCF = cooking conversion factor: ratio of mercury concentration in cooked fish to 
mercury concentration in uncooked fish (= 1.5); 
CHgFC = average mercury concentration in cooked freshwater fish (ppm); and 
C = average daily self-caught freshwater cooked fish consumption rate (gm/day) 
= 8 gm/day. 
To determine an appropriate daily fish consumption rate (C) for the analysis, EPA 
conducted an extensive review of existing literature characterizing self-caught freshwater fish 
 5-61 
consumption. Based on this review, it was decided that the ingestion rates for recreational 
freshwater fishers, specified as ―recommended‖ in EPA‘s Environmental Exposure Factors 
Handbook (EPA, 1997) (mean of 8 gm/day and 95
th
 percentile of 25 gm/day), represented the 
most appropriate values to use in this analysis. These recommended values were derived based 
on ingestion rates from four studies conducted in Maine, Michigan, and Lake Ontario (Ebert et 
al., 1992; Connelly et al., 1996; West et al., 1989; West et al., 1993), which measured annual 
average daily intake rates for self-caught freshwater fish by all recreational fishers including 
consumers and non-consumers of fish. The mean values presented in these four studies ranged 
from 5 to 17 gm/day, while the 95
th
 percent values ranged from 13 to 39 gm/day (Note: the 39 
gm/day value actually represents a 96
th
 percent value). The EPA ―recommended values‖ were 
developed by considering the range and spread of means and 95
th
 percentile values presented in 
the four studies. EPA recognizes that using mean and 95
th
 percentile consumption rates based on 
these four studies may not be representative of fishing behavior across the entire 48-state study 
area and that regional trends in consumption may differ from the values used in this analysis. 
Moreover, rates of consumption by pregnant women in freshwater angler households may be 
different from those of the recreational fishers themselves. However, EPA believes that these 
four studies do represent the best available data for developing recreational fisher ingestion rates 
in the United States. 
Because the consumption rate estimate C is for cooked fish and the mercury 
concentrations are estimated for uncooked filet, a conversion factor (CCF) was applied to 
estimate mercury concentrations in cooked fish. Cooking fish tends to reduce the overall weight 
of fish by approximately one-third (Great Lakes Sport Fish Advisory Task Force, 1993). Because 
volatilization of mercury is unlikely to occur during cooking, the overall amount of mercury will 
stay unchanged during cooking, and the concentration of mercury will increase by a factor of 
roughly 1.5 (Morgan, Berry, and Graves, 1997). 
5.8.3 Estimation of Lost Future Earnings 
Estimating the IQ decrements in children that result from mothers‘ ingestion of mercury 
required two steps. First, based on the estimated average daily maternal ingestion rate, the 
expected mercury concentration in the hair of exposed pregnant women was estimated as 
follows: 
 CHgHn = (0.08)
-1
 * (HgIn/W), (5.5) 
 5-62 
where 
CHgH = average mercury concentration in maternal hair (ppm) and 
W = average body weight for female adults below age 45 (= 64 kg). 
This conversion rate between average daily ingestion rate and maternal hair concentration 
is based on the one compartment model developed by Swartout and Rice (2000). The 2002 EPA 
Workshop on Methylmercury Neurotoxicity recommended that this one compartment model 
might be better suited than the PBPK model in modeling dose-response (EPA, 2002). The 
average body weight estimate (W) was based on EPA‘s Exposure Factor Handbook (EPA, 
1997). 
Second, to estimate the expected IQ decrement in offspring resulting from in-utero 
exposure to mercury through mothers‘ fish consumption, the following dose-response 
relationship was applied: 
 dIQn = 0.18 * CHgHn, (5.6) 
where 
dIQ = IQ decrement in exposed mother/child (IQ pts). 
The 0.18 dose-response coefficient in this equation is based on the summary findings reported in 
Axelrad et al. (2007). 
The valuation approach used to assess monetary losses due to IQ decrements is based on 
an approach applied in previous EPA analyses (EPA, 2008). The approach expresses the loss to 
an affected individual resulting from IQ decrements in terms of foregone future earnings (net of 
changes in education costs) for that individual. These losses were estimated using the following 
equation: 
 Vn = VIQ * dIQi, (5.7) 
where 
V = present value of net loss per exposed mother/child (2006 dollars) and 
VIQ = net loss per change in IQ point. 
 5-63 
The net loss per IQ point decrement is estimated based on the following relationship: 
 VIQ = (z * PVY) – (s * PVS), (5.8) 
where 
PVY = median present value of lifetime earnings, 
PVS = present value of education costs per additional year of schooling, 
z = percentage change in PVY per 1-point change in IQ, and 
s = years of additional schooling per 1-point increase in IQ. 
The estimate for PVY is derived using earnings and labor force participation rate data 
from the 2006 Current Population Survey (CPS) and assuming (1) an individual born today 
would begin working at age 16 and retire at age 67; (2) the growth rate of wages is 1% per year, 
adjusted for survival probabilities and labor force participation by age; and (3) lifetime earnings 
are discounted back to the year of birth. Using a 3% discount rate, the resulting present value of 
median lifetime earnings is $555,427 in 2006 dollars. 
Estimates of the average effect of a 1-point increase in IQ on lifetime earnings (z) range 
from a 1.76% increase (Schwartz, 1994) to a 2.379% increase (Salkever, 1995). The percentage 
increases in the two studies reflect both the direct impact of IQ on hourly wages and indirect 
effects on annual earnings as the result of additional schooling and increased labor force 
participation. The estimate for s is based on Schwartz (1994) who reports an increase of 0.131 
years of schooling per IQ point. 
In addition to this positive net effect on earnings, an increase in IQ is also assumed to have a 
positive effect on the amount of time spent in school (s) and on associated costs (PVS). The 
range of estimate for s is based on Schwartz (1994) who reports an increase of 0.131 years of 
schooling per IQ point and Salkever (1995) who reports an increase of 0.1007 years. 
The estimate for PVS is derived using an estimate of $16,425 per additional year of schooling in 
1992 dollars (EPA, 2005), which is based on U.S. Department of Education data reflecting both 
direct annual expenditures per student and annual average opportunity cost (i.e., lost income 
from being in school). We assume these costs are incurred when an individual born today turns 
19, based on an average 12.9 years of education among people aged 25 and over in the United 
 5-64 
States. Discounting at a 3% rate to the year of birth results in an estimate of $13,453 per 
additional year of schooling in 2006 dollars. 
To incorporate (1) uncertainty regarding the size of z and (2) different assumptions regarding the 
discount rate, the resulting value estimates for the average net loss per IQ point decrement (VIQ) 
are expressed as a range. Assuming a 3% discount rate, VIQ ranges from $8,013 (using the 
Schwartz estimate for z and s) to $11,859 (using the Salkever estimates). With a 7% discount 
rate assumption, the VIQ estimates range from $893 to $1,958. 
5.8.4 Analysis of Potentially High-Risk Subpopulations 
The methodology described above is designed to evaluate the aggregate effect of fish 
tissue mercury concentrations and, correspondingly, the aggregate benefits of reduced 
concentrations due to proposed emission controls. However, this approach does not provide 
specific insight into the effects for subpopulations that may be at particularly high risk from 
mercury exposures because of freshwater fish consumption. In particular, the aggregate analysis 
applies a uniform average fish consumption rate (C) for the entire exposed population. Although 
appropriate for an aggregate analysis, this single average rate obscures the large variation in 
consumption rates that have been observed in studies of specific subpopulations. 
To assess effects on potentially high-risk populations, we modified the methodology 
described above in Section 5.7.2 and focused on six subpopulations for which more specific 
freshwater fish consumption rate estimates are available: 
 low-income African-American recreational/subsistence fishers in the Southeast 
region1 
 low-income white recreational/subsistence fishers in the Southeast region 
 low-income female recreational/subsistence fishers 
 Hispanic subsistence fishers 
 Laotian subsistence fishers 
 Chippewa/Ojibwe Tribe members in the Great Lakes area 
                                                 
1
 The low-income designation is based on Census 2000 estimates of populations living in poverty. The Southeast for 
purposes of this analysis comprises Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
 5-65 
These specific subpopulations were selected based on published empirical evidence of 
particularly high self-caught freshwater fish consumption rates among these groups. Evidence for 
the first three groups is based on a study by Burger (2002), which collected survey data from a 
random sample of participants in the Palmetto Sportsmen‘s Classic in Columbia, SC. Out of 458 
respondents, 39 were black, 415 were white, and 149 were female. The sample size for the black 
population is relatively small, which increases uncertainty, particularly in higher percentile 
consumption rate values provided for this group. In this study, results are also split out for poor 
respondents (0-20K$ annual income). These consumption rates are relatively high, particularly 
for the higher percentiles. This observation forms the basis for our decision to assess a number of 
the subsistence populations only for watersheds located in US Census tracts containing members 
of source populations below the poverty line for the white and black populations. The black and 
white fisher populations were extrapolated to cover all watersheds modeled for risk in the 
Southeastern states. The rationale for this was that fishing activity by these two groups could be 
generalized in this region of the country. Note, however that these scenarios were only assessed 
for watersheds in the Southeast located within US Census tracts with at least 25 individuals from 
that ethnic group below the poverty line. Given the focus of the risk assessment on consumption 
by women (in considering risk to pregnant women in particular), we extrapolated the female 
consumption rates to all watersheds in the continental US with at least 25 individuals below the 
poverty line. 
Evidence for the Hispanic and Laotian groups are based on a study by Shilling et al. 
(2010).  This study looks at subsistence fishing activity among ethnic groups associated with 
more urbanized areas near the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers in the Central Valley in CA. 
The authors note that many of these ethnic groups relied on fishing in origin countries and bring 
that practice here (e.g., Cambodian, Vietnamese and Mexican).  The authors also note that fish 
consumption rates reported here for specific ethnic groups (specifically Southeast Asian) are 
generally in-line with rates seen in WA and OR studies. The fish consumption rates for 
Hispanics and Laotians were extrapolated to cover US Census tracts with at least 25 poor 
members of the ethnic populations. 
For the Chippewa population, we use results from a study by Dellinger (2004), which 
gathered data on self-reported fish consumption rates by Tribes in the Great Lakes area. Because 
fishing activity is highly variable across Tribes (and closely associated with heritage cultural 
practices) we have not extrapolated fishing behavior outside of the areas ceded to the Tribes 
covered in the study (regions in the vicinity of the Great Lakes).  The terms ―subsistence‖ and 
―recreational‖ fishing are based on the terminology used in these published studies to describe 
 5-66 
the population of interest.  In general, subsistence fishers are individuals whose primary 
objective in fishing is to acquire food for household consumption.  For recreational fishers, the 
primary objective is to enjoy the outdoor activity; however, fish consumption is also often an 
objective. 
To assess the distribution of individual risks from mercury exposure in these specific 
subpopulations, we modified the methodology in the following ways: 
1. We limited the analysis to only include census tracts with at least 25 residents (100 
residents for the Chippewa group) in the defined demographic group (based on the 
2000 Census). Tracts with fewer individuals were assumed to be less representative 
of the location and conditions of the subpopulation of interest. 
2. Rather than using four distance intervals around each census tract, we limited the 
analysis to one distance interval (0 to 20 miles). This interval was selected to better 
reflect the likely shorter distances traveled by low-income and/or subsistence fishers 
who fish with relatively high frequency. As a result, the populations were not 
subdivided according to income or urban classification; however, the separation 
between river and lake anglers was preserved using the same methodology described 
above to define cr and cl. 
3. Due to data limitations, rather than specifically selecting and estimating populations 
of pregnant women in angler households for the high-risk demographic subgroup of 
interest, we used the entire population of the defined demographic subgroup in each 
selected census tract. This approach was used because the purpose of this part of the 
analysis is not to estimate the total size of the exposed population or the aggregate 
impacts on this demographic subgroup. Instead, the objective is to examine the 
potential distribution of risks within the group. Using the entire subgroup population 
to represent the risk distribution in the exposed population relies on the key 
assumption that the spatial distribution of the entire subgroup provides a reasonable 
approximation for the distribution of pregnant women in high-consuming angler 
households. In other words, it was assumed that the expected proportion of the 
subgroup‘s population in each Census tract that consists of pregnant women in fishing 
households is the same across the selected census tracts. The main limitation of this 
assumption is that it does not allow or account for spatial variation in freshwater 
angler participation rates for the subgroups of interest. Unfortunately, data to address 
these limitations are not readily available. 
 5-67 
4. Population size projections for future years (beyond 2000) in each selected tract were 
based on county-level growth projections for the full population (all ages and both 
sexes) in the most closely corresponding race category (Woods and Poole, 2008). For 
example, the Asian and Native American categories were used for the Laotian and 
Chippewa population projections, respectively. 
5. Rather than assuming a single fish consumption rate (C) for all exposed individuals, 
the analysis assumed and applied a different distribution of consumption rates for 
each subgroup, based on evidence from existing empirical studies (see Table 5-3). 
Using the consumption rate information reported in Table 5-3, we fit a separate log-
normal distribution of consumption rates for each of the six subpopulations. We then 
applied Equation (5.2) to estimate a specific mercury ingestion rate (HgI) for each 
subpopulation member in the selected census tracts. To specify the average fish tissue 
mercury concentration (CHg), residents were divided into river and lake fishers 
according to the state-level percentages (as described in Section 5.7.2) and assigned 
the corresponding average mercury concentration within the 20-mile interval from the 
tract centroid. To specify the consumption rate (C) for each individual, we randomly 
drew a separate value from the specific log-normal consumption rate distribution 
developed for the subpopulation. Equations (5.3) to (5.8) were then used to estimate 
the corresponding IQ loss for each individual.

5.9 Mercury Benefits and Risk Analysis Results 
5.9.1 Baseline Incidence 
Applying the methodology described in Section 5.7, we first used GIS to link census tract 
centroids in the continental United States with HUC-12 watersheds containing mercury fish 
tissue sample data for 1995 to 2007. We found that, out of the 64,500 tracts in the 48-state area, 
almost all of them are located within 100 miles of at least one HUC-12 with freshwater mercury 
fish tissue sampling data. Therefore, very few tracts were entirely excluded from the analysis due 
to a lack of sampling data within 100 miles. Table 5-4 reports the number of tracts linked to 
HUC-level river or lake mercury concentration estimates within each distance interval. As 
expected, this number decreases as the size of the distance interval decreases. For example, 33% 
are within 10 miles of a HUC-12 containing a lake sample, and 52% are within 10 miles of a 
HUC-12 containing a river sample. 
Table 5-4 also reports the average river and lake HUC-level fish tissue mercury 
concentrations found within each distance interval. Assuming that the 1995 to 2007 samples are 
representative of baseline conditions in 2005, the distance-specific mean lake concentrations 
range from 0.26 to 0.3 ppm, and the mean river concentrations vary from 0.25 to 0.27 ppm. 
Table 5-4 also reports corresponding river and lake mercury concentration estimates for a 
2016 base case scenario. This scenario represents total mercury deposition from all global natural 
and anthropogenic sources based on projected 2016 conditions, including future anticipated 
regulations (e.g., Transport Rule). As described in Section 5.4, CMAQ air quality modeling runs 
were used to estimate average mercury deposition levels by HUC-12 sub-watershed under both 
the 2005 base case and the 2016 base case scenarios. For this analysis, it is assumed that HUC-
level fish tissue mercury concentrations would change (between the two scenarios) by the same 
percentage as the change in modeled deposition levels. Overall, the mean concentrations decline 
by 6% to 9% in the 2005 base case compared with the 2016 base case scenarios. 
With these tract-level mercury concentration estimates, we then estimated the size of the 
exposed populations (NPA) in 2005 and 2016. These estimates are reported in Table 5-5. As 
described in Section 5.7.2, a separate exposed population (NPAjk) was estimated for each 
distance interval (j = 1 – 4) and waterbody (k = lake or river) combination at each tract. If 
mercury concentration data were not available for a specific distance-waterbody combination, 
then the corresponding exposed population for the tract (NPAjk) was not included in the analysis. 
Consequently, the exposed population estimates reported in Table 5-5 are best interpreted as 
lower-bound estimates of the total exposed population. Excluding potentially exposed 
 5-72 
populations from the analysis because of missing/unavailable mercury concentration data 
reduced the total exposed population estimate by roughly 44%. These excluded populations 
include the portions of the tract-level exposed populations that were matched with fishing trip 
travel distances that either (1) did not overlap with at least one HUC-12 with sampling data or 
(2) were greater than 100 miles (see Appendix B). For 2005, there were estimated to be 239,174 
prenatally exposed children, and for 2016 the estimate is 244,286 prenatally exposed children.

For each exposed population, we then estimated their average mercury ingestion rate 
(HgI) using Equation (5.4) and the IQ loss associated with this exposure level. As reported in 
Table 5-5, in 2005, the average estimated mercury ingestion rate for the population of exposed 
pregnant women was 3.04 ug/day. For 2016, the ingestion rate was estimated to be 2.84 ug/day 
(6.6% lower). The corresponding average IQ loss per prenatally exposed child was 0.11 in 2005 
and 0.10 in 2016. Multiplying these average IQ losses by the size of the exposed population, the 
total loss in IQ points due to mercury exposures through consumption of self-caught freshwater 
fish was estimated to be 25,545 in 2005. For the 2016 base case, the total decrease in IQ points 
was estimated to be 24,419 (4.4% lower). 
5.9.2 IQ Loss and Economic Valuation Estimates 
In addition to the base case scenarios described above, CMAQ air quality modeling runs 
were used to estimate average mercury deposition levels for three emissions control scenarios: 
 2005 EGU Zero-Out. This scenario represents total mercury deposition from all 
global natural and anthropogenic sources except for U.S. EGUs based on current-day 
conditions. 
 2016 EGU Zero-Out. This scenario represents total mercury deposition from all 
global natural and anthropogenic sources except for U.S. EGUs based on projected 
2016 conditions, including future anticipated regulations (e.g., Transport Rule). 
 2016 Toxics Rule. This scenario represents total mercury deposition from all global 
natural and anthropogenic sources based on projected 2016 conditions, including 
future anticipated regulations (e.g., Transport Rule) and the Toxics Rule. 
For these three scenarios, it was again assumed that the HUC-level fish tissue mercury 
concentrations would change (relative to the 2005 base case) by the same percentage as the 
change in modeled deposition levels. 
Mercury exposure and IQ loss estimates were then derived for these three scenarios, 
using the exposed population estimates for the relevant year (2005 or 2016) and the 
corresponding mercury concentration estimates for the relevant emission scenario (zero-out or 
Toxics Rule). In addition, the valuation methodology summarized in Section 5.7.2 (in particular, 
Equation [5.7]) was applied to estimate the present value of IQ loss estimates for the two base 
case and three emissions control scenarios. 
 5-78 
To assess the aggregate benefits of reductions in EGU emissions, we evaluated five 
emission reduction scenarios. 
 2005 EGU zero-out (relative to 2005 base case) 
 2016 base case (relative to 2005 base case) 
 2016 EGU zero-out (relative to 2016 base case) 
 2016 Toxics Rule (relative to 2005 base case) 
 2016 Toxics Rule (relative to 2016 base case) 
The benefits of each emission reduction scenario are calculated as the difference (i.e., 
decrease) in total present value of IQ losses between the selected emission control scenario and 
the selected base case scenario. 
5.9.3 Primary Results for National Analysis of Exposures from Recreational Freshwater 
Fish Consumption 
Table 5-6 summarizes the aggregate national IQ and present-value loss estimates for the 
two base case and three emission control scenarios. The highest losses are estimated for the 2005 
base case. For the population of prenatally exposed children included in the analysis (almost 
240,000, as reported in Table 5-5), mercury exposures under baseline conditions during the year 
2005 are estimated to have resulted in more than 25,500 IQ points lost. Assuming a 3% discount 
rate, the present value of these losses ranges from $204.8 million to $292.5 million.1
 
This range 
of total loss estimates is based on the range of per-IQ-point value (VIQ) estimates summarized in 
Section 5.7.3. These losses represent expected present value of declines in future net earnings 
over the entire lifetimes of the children who are prenatally exposed during the year 2005. With a 
7% discount rate, the present value range is considerably lower: $22.8 million to $50.0 million. 
The lowest losses are estimated to result from the 2016 zero-out scenario, with total IQ 
losses of less than 24,000 among roughly 244,000 prenatally exposed children and present values 
of these losses ranging from $190.2 to $281.3 million (3% discount rate).

 Monetized benefits estimates are for an immediate change in MeHg levels in fish.  If a lag in the response of MeHg 
levels in fish were assumed, the monetized benefits could be significantly lower, depending on the length of the 
lag and the discount rate used.  As noted in the discussion of the Mercury Maps modeling, the relationship 
between deposition and fish tissue MeHg is proportional in equilibrium, but the MMaps approach does not 
provide any information on the time lag of response.

For the five emission reduction scenarios described above, Table 5-7 reports estimates of 
aggregate nationwide benefits associated with reductions in mercury exposures and resulting 
reductions in IQ losses. Most importantly, the benefits of the 2016 Toxics Rule scenario (relative 
to the 2016 base case) are estimated to range between $4.1 million and $5.8 million (assuming a 
3% discount rate), because of an estimated 511 point reduction in IQ losses. These benefits are 
73% as large as the benefits of the 2016 zero-out scenario (relative to the same 2016 base case). 
Relative to the 2005 base case, the benefits of the 2016 Toxics Rule scenario range from $13.1 
million to $18.7 million (3% discount). Despite growth in the exposed population from 2005 to 
2016, the changes from the 2005 base case to the 2106 base case account for 69% of these 
benefits, while the changes from the 2016 base case to the 2016 Toxics Rule account for 31%.

5.9.4 Primary Results for Potentially High-Risk Subpopulations 
As described in Section 5.7.4, the methodology used to estimate the aggregate benefits of 
mercury emission reductions was also adapted and applied to assess effects on the distribution of 
individual-level risks among specific potentially high-risk subpopulations in the United States. 
The analysis of these subpopulations focuses on the distribution of individual mercury exposures 
risks (i.e., expected IQ loss) within these groups, particularly in the high end of the risk 
distributions. It also examines the distribution of reductions in IQ loss in these groups as a result 
of EGU mercury emission reductions. 
Low-Income African-American Recreational/Subsistence Fishers in the Southeast Region 
The analysis of low-income African-Americans in the Southeast United States focuses on 
census tracts that have (1) at least one HUC-12 within 20 miles with a mercury fish tissue 
concentration estimate and (2) at least 25 African-American inhabitants living below the poverty 
level. Using county-level growth projections, there were an estimated 3.09 million low-income 
 5-81 
African Americans in these areas in 2005, and 3.56 million are expected to reside in these areas 
in 2016.1 The geographic distribution of the expected 2016 population is shown in Figure 5-6. 
The spatial distribution of these population estimates for all low-income African 
Americans in these areas was used to model the distribution of risk among pregnant women in 
recreational/subsistence fishing households in this group. This approach was used because 
population estimates for this latter group are not readily available and difficult to generate. The 
approach assumes that the spatial distribution of these pregnant women is the same as for the 
total low-income African American population in these areas. Populations were linked at the 
tract level to average mercury fish tissue concentrations within 20 miles using the methods 
described in Section 5.7.4. The distribution of mercury ingestion and IQ loss resulting from these 
fish tissue levels was then simulated using the fish consumption rate distribution for this 
subpopulation summarized in Table 5-3. 
                                                 
1 A rough approximation of the size of the annual exposed population – low-income African American 
pregnant women in angler households in the Southeast in 2016-- can be estimated by multiplying the total 
population estimate (3.56 million) by (1) the percent of the total U.S. population that is female and age 15-44 (21%; 
Census 2000) (2) the fertility rate for African American women of childbearing age (6.9%; U.S. Vital Statistics 
2005), and (3) the percent of the low-income African American population that are freshwater fishers (6-8%; 
Henderson 2004).  The resulting estimated exposed population is between 9,400 and 12,600 individuals.

Table 5-8 summarizes the estimated distribution of IQ loss among this subpopulation due 
to mercury exposure through consumption of self-caught freshwater fish. These distribution 
estimates are reported for populations in two time periods (2005 and 2016) under base case 
conditions and under alternative emission control scenarios. In the 2016 base case, the median IQ 
loss is estimated to be 1.87 points and the 95th percentile is 11.56 points per exposed individual. 
Under the 2016 Toxics Rule, the median declines to 1.82 points and the 95th percentile to 11.33 
points.

Low-Income White Recreational/Subsistence Fishers in the Southeast Region 
The analysis of the low-income white population in the Southeast United States uses the

described in Table 5-3. For this group, the spatial distribution of all low-income whites in these 
areas was used to simulate the distribution of IQ losses resulting from exposures via pregnant 
women in recreational/subsistence fishing households.  The total low-income white population in 
the southeastern states was 3.26 million for 2005 and was projected to be 3.58 million in 2016.1 
The geographic distribution of this population for 2016 is shown in Figure 5-7.

fertility rate for white women of childbearing age (6.6%; U.S. Vital Statistics 2005), and (3) the percent of the

Comparison of Risk Distributions across High-Risk Subpopulations 
Using the results summarized above, Figure 5-12 compares the simulated IQ loss 
distributions for the six potential high-risk subpopulations under the 2016 base case scenario. 
The low-income African-American population in the Southeast United States stands out from the 
other groups, with relatively high individual risk levels at each percentile. It is estimated that 5% 
of the prenatally exposed population in this group in 2016 (the 95th and greater percentile) 
would experience IQ losses of more than 11.55 points because of mercury in freshwater fish 
under base case conditions. The group with the next highest estimated individual risk levels at 
the 95th percentile and above is the Laotian subpopulation, with IQ losses of 4.26 points and 
greater.

Figure 5-13 provides a similar comparison for the distribution of reductions in IQ loss 
associated with the 2016 Toxics Rule (relative to the 2016 base case). Again, the low-income 
African-American subpopulation stands out from the others with the highest reductions at each 
percentile. It is estimated that 5% of the prenatally exposed population in this group in 2016 
would have expected reductions in IQ losses of more than 0.274 points because of reductions in 
mercury emissions. At the 95th percentile, all of the other subpopulations have expected 
reductions in IQ loss between 0.03 and 0.053 IQ points.

5.9.5 Discussion of Assumptions, Limitations, and Uncertainties 
Uncertainty regarding the model results and estimates reported in Section 5.8 can arise 
from several sources. Some of the uncertainty can be attributed to model uncertainty. For 
example, to estimate exposures a number of different modeling approaches have been selected 
and combined.  The separate model components are summarized in Figure 5-4 and equations (5.) 
to (5.8), each of which simplifies potentially complex processes. The results, therefore, depend 
importantly on how these models are selected, specified, and combined. 
Another important source of uncertainty can be characterized as input or parameter 
uncertainties. Each of the modeling components discussed in this report requires summary data 
and estimates of key model parameters. For example, estimating IQ losses associated with 
consumption of freshwater fish requires estimates of the size of the exposed population of 
interest, the average mercury concentrations in consumed fish, the freshwater fish consumption 
rate for the exposed population, and the concentration-response relationship between mercury 
ingestion and IQ loss. All of these inputs are measured with some degree of uncertainty and can 
affect, to differing degrees, the confidence range of our summary results. The discussion below

identifies and highlights some of the key model parameters, characterizes the source and extent 
of uncertainties associated with them, and characterizes the potential effects of these 
uncertainties on the model results. 
To organize this discussion, we discuss different components of the modeling framework 
separately. This section first discusses issues related to estimating the mercury concentrations 
and then those related to estimating the exposed population. After that, it discusses issues related 
to matching these two components and then concludes by discussing the estimation of mercury 
ingestion through fish consumption. 
Mercury Concentration Estimates 
As described in Section 5.2.2, the mercury concentration estimates for the analysis come 
from several different sources, including fish tissue sample data from the National Listing of 
Fish Advisories (NLFA) and several other state- and national-level sources. These estimates 
were then used to approximate mercury concentrations across the study area. Some of the key 
assumptions, limitations, and uncertainties associated with these estimates are the following: 
 The fish tissue sampling data from various sources are subject to measurement and 
reporting error and variability. The NLFA is the largest and most detailed source of 
data on mercury in fish; however, even this system was not centrally designed (e.g., 
by EPA) using a common set of sampling and analytical methods. Rather, states 
collected the data primarily to support the development of advisories, and the data are 
submitted voluntarily to EPA. Each state uses different methods and criteria for 
sampling and allocates different levels of resources to their monitoring programs. In 
addition, there are uncertainties regarding the precise locations (lat/long coordinates) 
of some of the samples. The heterogeneity and potential errors across state sampling 
programs can bias the results in any direction and contribute to uncertainty. 
 The fish tissue sampling data were assigned as either lake or river samples, based on 
the site name and/or the location coordinates mapped to the nearest type of 
waterbody. This process also involves measurement error and may have resulted in 
misclassifications for some of the samples. These errors are not expected to bias 
results, but they contribute to uncertainty. 
 The mercury concentration estimates used in the model were based on simple 
temporal and spatial averages of reported fish tissue samples. This approach assumes 
that the mercury samples are representative of ―local‖ conditions (i.e., within the 
 5-97 
same HUC-12) in similar waterbodies (i.e., rivers or lakes). However, even though 
states use a variety of approaches to monitor and sample fish tissue contaminants, in 
some cases, the sampling sites are selected to target areas with high levels of angler 
activity and/or a high level of pollution potential. To the extent that sample selection 
procedures favor areas with relatively high mercury, the spatial extrapolation methods 
used in this report will tend to overstate exposures. These approaches also implicitly 
assume that mercury concentration estimates are strongly spatially correlated, such 
that closer sampling sites (i.e., from the same HUC or distance interval) provide more 
information about mercury concentrations than more distant sites. To the extent that 
spatial correlation is weaker than assumed, this will increase the degree of uncertainty 
in the modeling results. 
 To generate average mercury fish tissue concentration estimates, all available samples 
from the three main data sources (1995-2009) and from freshwater fish larger the 7 
inches were included in the analysis. Smaller fish were excluded to better 
approximate concentrations in the types of fish that are more likely to be consumed, 
and samples from years before 1995 were excluded to better represent more recent 
conditions. Even with these sample selection procedures, average concentration 
estimates from the retained samples may still under or overestimate actual 
concentrations in currently consumed fish. 
Exposed Population Estimates 
The methods described in Section 5.7 to estimate the total exposed population of interest  
in 2005 and 2016 involve the following key assumptions, limitations, and uncertainties: 
 The approach relies on data from the FHWAR to estimate state-level freshwater 
angler activity levels, including freshwater fishing participation rates and lake-to-
river trip ratios. Each of these data elements is measured with some error in the 
FHWAR, but they are based on a relatively large sample. More importantly the 
state-level averages are applied to each modeled census tract in the state; 
therefore, the model fails to capture within-state variation in these factors, which 
contributes to uncertainty in the model estimates. 
 The analysis also uses state-level fertility rate data to approximate the rate of 
pregnancy among women of childbearing age in angler households for a smaller 
geographic area. The state-level fertility rates from the National Vital Statistics 
are estimated with relatively little error; however, applying these rates to specific 
 5-98 
census tracts (and specifically to women in angler households) does involve 
considerably more uncertainty. 
 The approach assumes that, in each census tract, the percentage of women who 
live in freshwater angler households (i.e., households with at least one freshwater 
angler) is equal to the percentage of the state adult population that fishes. 
Applying the state-level participation rate to approximate the conditions at a block 
level creates uncertainty. More importantly, however, using individual-based 
fishing participation rates to approximate household rates is likely to 
underestimate the percentage of women living in freshwater angler households.1 
Unfortunately, data on household participation levels in freshwater fishing are not 
readily available. 
 Census tract populations are only included in the model if they are matched to 
distance intervals and waterbody types that have spatial overlap with at least one 
HUC-12 sub-watershed containing a mercury concentrations estimate for that 
waterbody type. By design, this approach undercounts the exposed population (by 
roughly 40 to 45%) and, therefore, leads to underestimates of national aggregate 
baseline exposures and risks and underestimates of the risk reductions and 
benefits resulting from mercury emission reductions. 
 All of the tract-level population estimates are based on Census 2000 data, which 
are projected forward to 2005 and 2016 using county-level growth projections for 
the subpopulations of interest from Woods and Poole (2008). Therefore, the 2005 
and 2016 population estimates incorporate uncertainty from both the growth 
projections themselves and from transferring the county-level growth estimates to 
the tract level. 
The purpose of the analysis of potentially high risk subpopulations is not to estimate the 
size of the exposed population but rather to characterize the distribution of individual-level risks 
in the subpopulations of interest. Nevertheless, the size and spatial distribution of the total 
population in each group was used as a proxy for characterizing the spatial distribution of 
pregnant women in freshwater fishing households in each group. 
                                                 
1
 For example, hypothetically if one out of every three members in each household fished, the population rate would 
be 33%, but the household rate would be 100%. 
 5-99 
The main assumption underlying this approach is that the expected proportion of the 
subgroup‘s population in each Census tract that consists of pregnant women in fishing 
households is the same across the selected census tracts. The main limitation of this assumption 
is that it does not allow or account for spatial variation in (1) the percentage of the subpopulation 
that are women of childbearing age, (2) the percentage of these women that are pregnant (i.e., 
fertility rate) and (3) the freshwater angler participation rates for the subgroups of interest. 
Unfortunately, spatially varying data for the last component (fishing participation rates among 
the subpopulations of interest) are not readily available. This assumption is not expected to bias 
the results but it does contribute to uncertainty in the estimated distributions of individual-level 
risks. 
Matching of Exposed Populations to Mercury Concentrations 
The methods described in Section 5.7 to match the exposed population estimates with the 
corresponding mercury concentration estimates involve the following key assumptions, 
limitations, and uncertainties: 
 For the aggregate benefits analysis, tract-level exposed populations are assigned to 
waterbody types based on state-level ratios of lake-to-river fishing days (from the 
FHWAR). They are further assigned to distance intervals based on observed travel 
distance patterns in national fishing data (NSRE, 1994). Both of these assignment 
methods involve uncertainty, but particularly the second method because it is based on 
much more aggregate data and on a much smaller and more dated sample of anglers. This 
approach does not take into account the physical characteristics of the area in which the 
population is located. In particular, the allocation of exposures to lakes or rivers at 
different distances from each census tract does not take into account the presence or 
number of these waterbodies in each distance interval. Using these state and national 
level estimates to represent conditions at a local (i.e., census tract) level increases 
uncertainty in the model results, but it is not expected to bias the results in either 
direction. 
 For the analysis of potentially high-risk populations, these methods and assumptions were 
slightly modified. In particular, because these analyses focus on low-income and/or 
subsistence fishing populations, all trips were assumed to occur within 20 miles of the 
census tract. Unfortunately, it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of this restriction due to 
limited data on travel distances for the subgroups of interest. 
 5-100 
One potentially important factor that is not included for matching populations and 
mercury concentrations is the effect of fish consumption advisories on fishing behavior. 
Evidence summarized in Jakus, McGuinness, and Krupnick (2002) suggests that awareness of 
advisories by anglers is relatively low (less than 50%), and even those who are aware do not 
always alter their fishing behavior. Nonetheless, anglers are less likely to fish in areas with 
advisories. Unfortunately, we were not able to reliably quantify the reduction and redistribution 
of fishing trips in either model to account for fish advisories. By excluding these effects, the 
model estimates are likely to overstate mercury exposures. 
Fish Consumption Estimates 
One of the most influential variables in both modeling approaches is the rate of self-
caught freshwater fish consumption. The following key assumptions, limitation, and 
uncertainties are associated with the methods used: 
 For the aggregate analysis we have assumed 8 g/day for the general population in 
freshwater angler households (based on recommendations in EPA‘s EFH). Unfortunately, 
data are not available to reliably vary this rate with respect to characteristics of the 
population across the entire study area. Uncertainty regarding the true average fish 
consumption rate has a direct effect on uncertainty for the aggregate exposure and benefit 
estimates. Because a single consumption rate is applied uniformly across the entire 
exposed population and because it is a multiplicative factor in the model, the two 
uncertainties are directly proportional to one another. The recommended 8 g/day rate is 
based on four studies with mean estimates ranging from 5 g/day (37% less than 8) to 17 
g/day (113% more than 8). If it is assumed that this range of estimates represents the 
uncertainty in the mean freshwater fish consumption rate for the study population, then 
the resulting uncertainty range for the estimated mean mercury ingestion level (and 
resulting IQ loss) will also be between –37% and +113% of the mean mercury ingestion 
level. 
 To analyze the distributions of individual-level risks in potentially high risk 
subpopulations, we applied empirical distributions of fish consumption rates for specific 
subpopulations. One of the main limitations of this approach is that these empirical 
distributions are based on relatively small and localized samples. In particular, the 
estimated distribution of consumption rates for low-income African American 
subsistence/recreational fishers in the Southeastern U.S. (see Table 5.3) is based on a 
very small sample (N=39) drawn from one location (Columbia, SC).  The sample sizes 
 5-101 
for the other groups, particularly the Hispanic (N= 45) and Laotian (N=54) populations 
are also small; therefore, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how well these 
empirical consumption rate distributions reflect actual rates of consumption in the 
subpopulations of interest. 
Another related and potentially influential variable in the modeling approach is the 
assumed conversion factor for mercury concentrations between uncooked and cooked fish. 
Studies have found that cooking fish tends to reduce the overall weight of fish by approximately 
one-third (Great Lakes Sport Fish Advisory Task Force, 1993) without affecting the overall 
amount of mercury. But these conversion rates depend on cooking practices and types of fish. 
Uncertainty regarding this conversion factor also has a proportionate effect on the modeling 
results. 
Measurement and Valuation of IQ Related Effects 
The models for estimating and valuing IQ effects involve three main steps. The first step 
is translating maternal mercury ingestion rates to mercury levels in hair. The second step is 
translating differences in hair mercury concentrations during pregnancy to IQ changes in 
offspring. The third step is translating IQ losses into expected reductions in lifetime earnings. As 
discussed below, each of these steps also involves the following assumptions, limitations, and 
uncertainties:. 
 The conversion of mercury ingestion rate to mercury concentration in hair is based on 
uncertainty analysis of a toxicokinetic model for estimating reference dose (Swartout 
and Rice, 2000). The conversion factor was estimated by considering the variability 
and uncertainty in various inputs used in deriving the dose including body weight, 
hair-to-blood mercury ratio, half-life of MeHg in blood, and others. Therefore, there 
is uncertainty regarding the conversion factor between hair mercury concentration 
and mercury ingestion rate. Although, the median conversion factor (0.08 μg/kg-
day/hair-ppm) is used, the 90% confidence interval is from 0.037 to 0.16 μg/kg 
day/hair-ppm. Any change in the conversion factor will proportionately affect the 
benefits results because of the linearity of the model. 
 The dose-response model used to estimate neurological effects on children because of 
maternal mercury body burden is susceptible to various uncertainties. In particular, 
there are three main concerns. First, there are other cognitive end-points that have 
stronger association with MeHg than IQ point losses. Therefore, using IQ points as a 
primary end point in the benefits assessment may underestimate the impacts. Second, 
 5-102 
blood-to-hair ratio for mercury is uncertain, which can cause the results from analyses 
based on mercury concentration in blood to be uncertain. Third, uncertainty is 
associated with the epidemiological studies used in deriving the dose-response 
models. 
 With regard to the relationship between prenatal methylmercury exposure and 
childhood IQ loss, we expect greater uncertainty in associated estimates of IQ loss as 
exposure levels increase beyond those observed in the primary studies (i.e., Faroe 
Islands, New Zealand, Seychelles Islands studies) used to derive the dose-response 
function. In particular, high-end total exposure estimates for some of the subsistence-
level fishing subpopulations included in this assessment likely exceed levels observed 
in the three primary studies. 
 To parameterize the dose-response relationship between maternal hair concentrations 
and IQ loss for this analysis, we applied the results of an integrative study by Axelrad 
et al. (2007). The implications of applying this study include the following: 
o This approach may confound potentially positive cognitive effects of fish 
consumption and, more specifically, omega-3 fatty acids. Results from Rice 
(2010) offer a reasonable, but highly uncertain, estimate for offsetting the possible 
downward bias resulting from the positive confounding effects of fatty acids. 
Rice‘s high coefficient reflects the central estimate of Axelrad but adjusted 
upwards by a factor of 1.5 to ―acknowledge the recent argument of Budtz-
Jorgensen (2007) that the parameter estimates from these three epidemiological 
studies (Faroe Islands, Seychelles Islands, New Zealand) may be biased 
downward by a factor of approximately 2 because of failure to adequately control 
for confounding.‖ A third study, Oken (2008), analyzes a cohort in Massachusetts 
and also seems to support a higher ―Axelrad-plus‖ coefficient range due to 
evidence of fatty acid confounding (i.e., positive cognitive effects of fatty acids in 
fish may have previously led to underestimates of mercury-attributable IQ loss). 
This study offers further qualitative support for a higher-end estimate but is 
limited by the fact that it did not control for the children‘s home environment, 
which is generally a significant factor in early cognitive development. 
o The dose-response coefficient from the Axelrad et al. study is sensitive to the 
exclusion of one outlier data point from the Seychelles study. Including the outlier 
would reduce the effect size by about 25 percent. If this outlier actually reflects 
 5-103 
the true response for a subset of the populations, then risks (as modeled) could be 
biased high specifically for this subpopulation 
o Because the dose-response coefficient is applied uniformly across the entire 
exposed population and is a multiplicative factor in the model, the uncertainty in 
this parameter has a directly proportional effect on the reported risk and benefit 
estimates. In other words, adjusting the absolute value of the dose-response 
coefficient upward by a factor of 1.5 (i.e., based on Rice, 2010) would yield 
reductions in IQ losses and benefits from mercury emission reductions that are 
also greater by a factor of 1.5. 
 The valuation of IQ losses is based on a unit-value approach developed by EPA, 
which estimates that the average effect of a 1-point reduction in IQ is to reduce the 
present value of net future earnings. Three key assumptions of this unit-value 
approach are that (1) there is a linear relationship between IQ changes and net 
earnings losses, (2) the unit value applies to even very small changes in IQ, and 
(3) the unit value will remain constant (in real present value terms) for several years 
into the future. Each of these assumptions contributes to uncertainty in the result. In 
particular the unit value estimate is itself subject to two main sources of uncertainty. 
o The first source is directly related to uncertainties regarding the average 
reductions in future earnings and years in school as a result of IQ changes. The 
average percentage change estimates are subject to statistical error, modeling 
uncertainties, and variability across the population. To address these uncertainties 
we have included in the analysis and reported results a range of values for this 
parameter, based on statistical analyses by Salkever (1995) and Schwartz (1994). 
o The second main source of uncertainty is the estimates of average lifetime 
earnings and costs of schooling. Both of these estimates are derived from national 
statistics from the early 1990s, but they are also subject to statistical error, 
modeling uncertainties, and variability across the population. It is also worth 
noting that the lost future earnings estimates do not include present value 
estimates for nonwage/nonsalary earnings (i.e., fringe benefits) and household 
(nonmarket) production. Based on the results of Grosse et al. (2009), including 
these factors would increase the present value of median earnings (both explicit 
and implicit) by a factor of roughly 1.9. However, it is not known whether IQ 
changes have a similar effect on these other (implicit) earnings. 
 5-104 
Unquantified Benefits 
In addition to the uncertainties discussed above associated with the benefit analysis of 
reducing exposures to MeHg from recreational freshwater angling, we are unable to quantify 
several additional benefits, which adds to the uncertainties in the final estimate of benefits. 
Table 5-20 displays the health and ecosystem effects associated with MeHg exposure that 
are discussed in Section 5.22 for which we are currently unable to quantify. We note that 
specifically with regard to health effects, the NRC (2000) provided the following observation: 
―Neurodevelopmental effects are the most extensively studied sensitive end point for MeHg 
exposure, but there remains some uncertainty about the possibility of other health effects at low 
levels of exposure. In particular, there are indications of immune and cardiovascular effects, as 
well as neurological effects emerging later in life, that have not been adequately studied.‖

Ecological Effects* Neurological effects in wildlife (birds, fish, and 
mammals) that is similar to humans 
*These are potential effects and are not quantified because the literature is either contradictory or incomplete. 
In addition to the health and ecosystem effects that we are not able to quantify, we are 
currently unable to quantify exposures to other segments of the U.S. population including 
consumption of commercial seafood and freshwater fish (produced domestically as well as 
imported from foreign sources) and consumption of recreationally caught seafood from estuaries, 
coastal waters, and the deep ocean. These consumption pathways impact additional recreational 
anglers who are not modeled in our benefits analysis as well as the general U.S. population. 
Reductions in domestic fish tissue concentrations can also impact the health of foreign 
consumers (consuming U.S. exports). Because of technical/theoretical limitations in the science, 
EPA is unable to quantify the benefits associated with several of these fish consumption 
pathways. For example, reductions in U.S. power plant emissions will result in a lowering of the 
global burden of elemental mercury, which will likely produce some degree of reduction in 
 5-105 
mercury concentrations for fish sourced from the open ocean and freshwater and estuarine 
waterbodies in foreign countries. In the case of mercury reductions for fish in the open ocean, 
complexities associated with modeling the linkage between changes in air deposition of mercury 
and reductions in biomagnification and bioaccumulation up the food chain (including open ocean 
dilution and the extensive migration patterns of certain high-consumption fish such as tuna) 
prevent the modeling of fish obtained from the open ocean. In the case of commercial fish 
obtained from foreign freshwater and estuarine waterbodies, although technical challenges are 
associated with modeling long-range transport of elemental mercury and the subsequent impacts 
to fish in these distant locations, additional complexities such as accurately modeling patterns of 
harvesting and their linkages to commercial consumption in the United States prevent inclusion 
of foreign-sourced freshwater and estuarine fish in the primary benefits analysis. 
Finally, with regard to commercially-produced freshwater fish sourced in the United 
States (i.e., fish from catfish, bass, and trout farms), we are unable to accurately quantify effects 
from this consumption pathway because many of the fish farms operating in the United States 
use feed that is not part of the aquatic food web of the waterbody containing the fish farm (e.g., 
use of agricultural-based supplemental feed). In addition, many of the farms involve artificial 
―constructed‖ waterbody environments that are atypical of aquatic environments found in the 
regions where those farms are located, thereby limiting the applicability of Mercury Maps‘ 
assumption in linking changes to mercury deposition to changes in mercury fish tissue 
concentrations (e.g., waterbodies may have restricted or absent watersheds and modified aquatic 
chemistry, which can effect methylation rates and impact time scales for reaching steady-state 
mercury fish tissue concentrations following reductions in mercury deposition). Some research 
indicates that the recycling of water at fish farms can magnify the mercury concentration because 
the system does not remove mercury as it is recycled, while newly deposited mercury is added to 
the system. Thus, additional research on aquaculture farms is necessary before a benefits analysis 
can be conducted. 
Exclusion of these commercial pathways means that this benefits analysis, although 
covering an important source of exposure to domestic mercury emissions (recreational 
freshwater anglers), excludes a large and potentially important group of individuals. Recreational 
freshwater consumption accounts for approximately 10 to 17% of total U.S. fish consumption, 
and 90% is derived from commercial sources (domestic seafood, aquaculture, and imports) 
(EPA, 2005). 
In conclusion, several unquantified benefits associated with this analysis add to the 
overall uncertainty in estimating total benefits. To the extent that the proposed rule will reduce 
 5-106 
mercury deposition from power plants over estuarine areas, coastal, and open ocean waters, there 
would be a subsequent reduction in mercury fish tissue concentrations in these different 
waterbodies and an associated benefit from avoided decrements in IQ and other known health 
and ecosystem effects. 
5.9.6 Overall Conclusions 
Total Baseline Incidence of IQ Loss: Self-Caught Fish Consumption among Recreational 
Freshwater Anglers 
 Out of 64,500 census tracts in the continental U.S., 63,978 are located within 100 
miles of at least one HUC-12 watershed with freshwater mercury fish tissue sampling 
data, and therefore were included in the modeling of IQ loss among recreational 
freshwater anglers. 
 Approximately 240,000 prenatally exposed children were modeled, with an average 
IQ loss of 0.11 and 0.10 IQ points, respectively, from self-caught freshwater fish 
consumption for the 2005 and 2016 base case scenarios. 
 The highest estimated state-specific average IQ loss among children of freshwater 
recreational anglers is 0.21 IQ points under the 2005 base case scenario, in both 
California and Rhode Island. 
 Total estimated IQ loss from self-caught freshwater fish consumption among children 
of recreational anglers is estimated at 25,555 and 24,419 IQ points, respectively, for 
the 2005 and 2016 base case scenarios. 
 The present economic value of baseline IQ loss for 2005 ranges from $204.7 million 
to $302.9 million, assuming a 3% discount rate, and from $22.8 million to $50 
million, assuming a 7% discount rate. 
 The present economic value of baseline IQ loss for 2016 ranges from $195.7 million 
to $289.6 million, assuming a 3% discount rate, and from $21.8 million to $47.8 
million, assuming a 7% discount rate.

 Eliminating all mercury air emissions from U.S. EGUs in 2016 would result in an 
estimated 0.00893 fewer IQ points lost per prenatally exposed child from self-caught 
freshwater fish consumption, as compared with the 2005 base case scenario. 
 The present economic value of avoided IQ loss from eliminating all mercury air 
emissions from U.S. EGUs in 2016 is estimated at a range of $5.6 million to $8.3 
million, assuming a 3% discount rate, and $0.6 million to $1.4 million, assuming a 
7% discount rate. 
 5-107 
 Reduced mercury air emissions due to implementation of the Toxics Rule in 2016 
would result in an estimated 0.00209 fewer IQ points lost per prenatally exposed 
child from self-caught freshwater fish consumption, as compared with the 2016 base 
case scenario. 
 The present economic value of avoided IQ loss from reduced mercury air emissions 
due to implementation of the Toxics Rule in 2016 is estimated at a range of $4.1 
million to $6.1 million, assuming a 3% discount rate, and $0.5 million to $1 million, 
assuming a 7% discount rate.

 We do note that overall confidence in IQ loss estimates above approximately 7 points decreases because we begin 
to apply the underlying IQ loss function at exposure levels (ppm hair levels) above those reflected in 
epidemiological studies used to derive those functions. The 39.1 ppm was the highest measured ppm level in the 
Faroes Island study, while ~86 was the highest value in the New Zealand study (USEPA, 2005) (a 7 IQ points 
loss is approximately associated with a 40 ppm hair level given the concentration-response function we are 
using).

5.10 Benefits Associated with Reductions in Other HAP than Mercury 
5.10.1 Hazards 
Emissions data collected during development of this proposed rule show that HCl 
emissions represent the predominant HAP emitted by industrial boilers.  Coal- and oil-fired 
EGUs emit lesser amounts of HF, chlorine, metals (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb), and organic 
HAP emissions.  Although numerous organic HAP may be emitted from coal- and oil-fired 
EGUs, only a few account for essentially all the mass of organic HAP emissions.  These organic 
HAP are formaldehyde, benzene, and acetaldehyde. 
Exposure to high levels of these HAP is associated with a variety of adverse health 
effects.  These adverse health effects include chronic health disorders (e.g., irritation of the lung, 
skin, and mucus membranes, effects on the central nervous system, and damage to the kidneys), 
and acute health disorders (e.g., lung irritation and congestion, alimentary effects such as nausea 
and vomiting, and effects on the kidney and central nervous system).  We have classified three of 
the HAP as human carcinogens and five as probable human carcinogens.  The following sections 
briefly discuss the main health effects information we have regarding the key HAPs emitted by 
EGUs. 
 5-109 
Acetaldehyde 
Acetaldehyde is classified in EPA‘s IRIS database as a probable human carcinogen, 
based on nasal tumors in rats, and is considered toxic by the inhalation, oral, and intravenous 
routes.
1
  Acetaldehyde is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in the 11
th
 Report on Carcinogens and is 
classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) by the IARC.
2,3
  The primary 
noncancer effects of exposure to acetaldehyde vapors include irritation of the eyes, skin, and 
respiratory tract.
4
 
Arsenic 
Arsenic, a naturally occurring element, is found throughout the environment and is 
considered toxic through the oral, inhalation and dermal routes.  Acute (short-term) high-level 
inhalation exposure to As dust or fumes has resulted in gastrointestinal effects (nausea, diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage); central and peripheral nervous system 
disorders have occurred in workers acutely exposed to inorganic As.  Chronic (long-term) 
inhalation exposure to inorganic As in humans is associated with irritation of the skin and 
mucous membranes.  Chronic inhalation can also lead to conjunctivitis, irritation of the throat 
and respiratory tract and perforation of the nasal septum.
5
  Chronic oral exposure has resulted in 
gastrointestinal effects, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, skin lesions, hyperpigmentation, and liver 
or kidney damage in humans.  Inorganic As exposure in humans, by the inhalation route, has 
been shown to be strongly associated with lung cancer, while ingestion of inorganic As in 
humans has been linked to a form of skin cancer and also to bladder, liver, and lung cancer.  EPA 
has classified inorganic As a Group A, human carcinogen.

Benzene 
The EPA‘s IRIS database lists benzene as a known human carcinogen (causing leukemia) 
by all routes of exposure, and concludes that exposure is associated with additional health 
effects, including genetic changes in both humans and animals and increased proliferation of 
bone marrow cells in mice.
1,2,3
  EPA states in its IRIS database that data indicate a causal 
relationship between benzene exposure and acute lymphocytic leukemia and suggest a 
relationship between benzene exposure and chronic non-lymphocytic leukemia and chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia.  The IARC has determined that benzene is a human carcinogen and the 
DHHS has characterized benzene as a known human carcinogen.
4,5
 
A number of adverse noncancer health effects including blood disorders, such as 
preleukemia and aplastic anemia, have also been associated with long-term exposure to 
benzene.
6,7
 
Cadmium 
Breathing air with lower levels of Cd over long periods of time (for years) results in a 
build-up of Cd in the kidney, and if sufficiently high, may result in kidney disease.  Lung cancer 
has been found in some studies of workers exposed to Cd in the air and studies of rats that 
inhaled Cd.  The U.S. DHHS has determined that Cd and Cd compounds are known human 
carcinogens.  The IARC has determined that Cd is carcinogenic to humans.  EPA has determined 
that Cd is a probable human carcinogen.

Chlorine 
The acute (short term) toxic effects of Cl2 are primarily due to its corrosive properties.  
Chlorine is a strong oxidant that upon contact with water moist tissue (e.g., eyes, skin, and upper 
respiratory tract) can produce major tissue damage.
1
  Chronic inhalation exposure to low 
concentrations of Cl2 (1 to 10 parts per million, ppm) may cause eye and nasal irritation, sore 
throat, and coughing.  Chronic exposure to Cl2, usually in the workplace, has been reported to 
cause corrosion of the teeth.  Inhalation of higher concentrations of Cl2 gas (greater than 15 ppm) 
can rapidly lead to respiratory distress with airway constriction and accumulation of fluid in the 
lungs (pulmonary edema).  Exposed individuals may have immediate onset of rapid breathing, 
blue discoloration of the skin, wheezing, rales or hemoptysis (coughing up blood or blood-stain 
sputum).  Intoxication with high concentrations of Cl2 may induce lung collapse.  Exposure to 
Cl2 can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), a chemical irritant-induced type 
of asthma.  Dermal exposure to Cl2 may cause irritation, burns, inflammation and blisters.  EPA 
has not classified Cl2 with respect to carcinogenicity. 
Chromium 
Chromium may be emitted in two forms, trivalent Cr (Cr
+3
) or hexavalent Cr (Cr
+6
).  The 
respiratory tract is the major target organ for Cr
+6
 toxicity, for acute and chronic inhalation 
exposures.  Shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing have been reported from acute exposure 
to Cr
+6
, while perforations and ulcerations of the septum, bronchitis, decreased pulmonary 
function, pneumonia, and other respiratory effects have been noted from chronic exposures.  
Limited human studies suggest that Cr
+6
 inhalation exposure may be associated with 
complications during pregnancy and childbirth, but there are no supporting data from animal 
studies reporting reproductive effects from inhalation exposure to Cr
+6
.  Human and animal 
studies have clearly established the carcinogenic potential of Cr
+6
 by the inhalation route, 
resulting in an increased risk of lung cancer.  EPA has classified Cr
+6
 as a Group A, human 
carcinogen.  Trivalent Cr is less toxic than Cr
+6
.  The respiratory tract is also the major target 
organ for Cr
+3
 toxicity, similar to Cr
+6
.  EPA has not classified Cr
+3
 with respect to 
carcinogenicity.

 5-112 
Formaldehyde 
Since 1987, EPA has classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen based on 
evidence in humans and in rats, mice, hamsters, and monkeys.
1
  EPA is currently reviewing 
recently published epidemiological data.  After reviewing the currently available epidemiological 
evidence, the IARC (2006) characterized the human evidence for formaldehyde carcinogenicity 
as ―sufficient,‖ based upon the data on nasopharyngeal cancers; the epidemiologic evidence on 
leukemia was characterized as ―strong.‖2  EPA is reviewing the recent work cited above from the 
NCI and NIOSH, as well as the analysis by the CIIT Centers for Health Research and other 
studies, as part of a reassessment of the human hazard and dose-response associated with 
formaldehyde. 
Formaldehyde exposure also causes a range of noncancer health effects, including 
irritation of the eyes (burning and watering of the eyes), nose and throat.  Effects from repeated 
exposure in humans include respiratory tract irritation, chronic bronchitis and nasal epithelial 
lesions such as metaplasia and loss of cilia.  Animal studies suggest that formaldehyde may also 
cause airway inflammation – including eosinophil infiltration into the airways.  There are several 
studies that suggest that formaldehyde may increase the risk of asthma – particularly in the 
young.
3,4
 
Hydrogen Chloride 
Hydrogen chloride is a corrosive gas that can cause irritation of the mucous membranes 
of the nose, throat, and respiratory tract.  Brief exposure to 35 ppm causes throat irritation, and 
levels of 50 to 100 ppm are barely tolerable for 1 hour.
5
  The greatest impact is on the upper 
respiratory tract; exposure to high concentrations can rapidly lead to swelling and spasm of the 
throat and suffocation.  Most seriously exposed persons have immediate onset of rapid breathing, 
blue coloring of the skin, and narrowing of the bronchioles.  Exposure to HCl can lead to RADS,

a chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma.  Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive 
agents than adults because of the relatively smaller diameter of their airways.  Children may also 
be more vulnerable to gas exposure because of increased minute ventilation per kg and failure to 
evacuate an area promptly when exposed.  Hydrogen chloride has not been classified for 
carcinogenic effects.
1
 
Hydrogen Fluoride 
Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to gaseous HF can cause severe respiratory 
damage in humans, including severe irritation and pulmonary edema.  Chronic (long-term) oral 
exposure to fluoride at low levels has a beneficial effect of dental cavity prevention and may also 
be useful for the treatment of osteoporosis.  Exposure to higher levels of fluoride may cause 
dental fluorosis.  One study reported menstrual irregularities in women occupationally exposed 
to fluoride via inhalation.  The EPA has not classified HF for carcinogenicity2. 
Lead 
The main target for Pb toxicity is the nervous system, both in adults and children.  Long-
term exposure of adults to Pb at work has resulted in decreased performance in some tests that 
measure functions of the nervous system.  Lead exposure may also cause weakness in fingers, 
wrists, or ankles.  Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure, particularly in 
middle-aged and older people.  Lead exposure may also cause anemia. 
Children are more sensitive to the health effects of Pb than adults.  No safe blood Pb level 
in children has been determined.  At lower levels of exposure, Pb can affect a child‘s mental and 
physical growth.  Fetuses exposed to Pb in the womb may be born prematurely and have lower 
weights at birth.  Exposure in the womb, in infancy, or in early childhood also may slow mental 
development and cause lower intelligence later in childhood.  There is evidence that these effects 
may persist beyond childhood.

There are insufficient data from epidemiologic studies alone to conclude that Pb causes 
cancer (is carcinogenic) in humans.  The DHHS has determined that Pb and Pb compounds are 
reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens based on limited evidence from studies in 
humans and sufficient evidence from animal studies, and the EPA has determined that Pb is a 
probable human carcinogen. 
xi.  Manganese 
Health effects in humans have been associated with both deficiencies and excess intakes 
of Mn.  Chronic exposure to high levels of Mn by inhalation in humans results primarily in 
central nervous system effects.  Visual reaction time, hand steadiness, and eye-hand coordination 
were affected in chronically-exposed workers.  Manganism, characterized by feelings of 
weakness and lethargy, tremors, a masklike face, and psychological disturbances, may result 
from chronic exposure to higher levels.  Impotence and loss of libido have been noted in male 
workers afflicted with manganism attributed to inhalation exposures.  The EPA has classified Mn 
in Group D, not classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans1. 
Nickel 
Respiratory effects have been reported in humans from inhalation exposure to Ni.  No 
information is available regarding the reproductive or developmental effects of Ni in humans, but 
animal studies have reported such effects.  Human and animal studies have reported an increased 
risk of lung and nasal cancers from exposure to Ni refinery dusts and nickel subsulfide.  The 
EPA has classified nickel subsulfide as a human carcinogen and nickel carbonyl as a probable 
human carcinogen2
,3.  The IARC has classified Ni compounds as carcinogenic to humans4. 
Selenium 
Acute exposure to elemental Se, hydrogen selenide, and selenium dioxide (SeO2) by 
inhalation results primarily in respiratory effects, such as irritation of the mucous membranes, 
pulmonary edema, severe bronchitis, and bronchial pneumonia.  One Se compound, selenium 
sulfide, is carcinogenic in animals exposed orally.  EPA has classified elemental Se as a Group

APPENDIX B.  
ANALYSIS OF TRIP TRAVEL DISTANCE FOR RECREATIONAL FRESHWATER 
ANGLERS 
As described in Section 5.7.7, the method used to estimate exposures to mercury in 
freshwater fish requires information about how far individuals typically travel for freshwater 
fishing. This appendix describes the data and methods used to analyze travel distance patterns by 
freshwater anglers, and it reports the results that were used to estimate exposures. 
B.1 Data 
To conduct an analysis of trip travel distance for freshwater anglers, we used data from 
the NSRE 1994. As described previously, this 16,000-person survey elicited information on 
water-based recreation activities—specifically boating, fishing, swimming, and wildlife 
viewing—during the previous year. Respondents were asked about their most recent trip taken in 
each of the four categories. Of particular interest to this analysis is data concerning fishing trip 
characteristics for all respondents who fished in freshwater bodies during the previous year. Of 
the 3,220 respondents who had reported fishing, 2,482 visited either a lake, pond, river, or stream 
on their most recent trip. 
The fishing module elicited location information about most recent fishing trip taken 
during the preceding 12 months. This trip was recorded as either a single- or multiday trip to a 
specific water body (―site‖) identified by the respondent. Subsequently, a series of questions 
were asked to gather location data on the specific site visited, including the site name, the state in 
which the site was located, and the name of the city or town nearest the site. To identify potential 
determinants of travel distance for a freshwater fishing trip, we analyzed the 2,384 available 
responses to the following survey question: ―What was the one way travel distance, in miles 
from your home, to your destination on *site*?‖ Table B-1 presents summary statistics for travel 
distance, which are reported separately for single-day, multiday, and aggregated trips. As would 
be expected, median travel distance varied according to trip type, from 20 miles for a single-day 
trip to almost 140 miles for a multiday trip. Across both trip types, the average travel distance 
was slightly less than 100 miles.

a Seven respondents reported traveling 0 miles for their most recent trip; all were described as single-day trips. 
Note: Ninety-eight respondents who visited freshwater bodies on their most recent fishing trip did not report the travel distance. 
B.2 Analysis of Travel Distance Data 
The influence of multiple demographic characteristics on travel distance was tested using 
multivariate regression analysis. Table B-2 reports descriptive statistics for the anglers included 
in this analysis. As indicated by the table, over 90 percent of the sample is white; males comprise 
a higher percentage of the sample (62 percent) than females. More than half the sample had 
completed at least some college and three-fourths of the sample reported being employed. The 
survey asked respondents to classify their place of residence as either rural, suburban, or urban.  
Approximately 40 percent described their area as rural, 37 percent as suburban, and 23 percent as 
urban. Respondents were assigned to a U.S. Census geographic region by matching their zip 
code to a corresponding state. The states were then aggregated to the appropriate Census region 
(http://www.census.gov/geo/www/us_regdiv.pdf). The majority of respondents resided in the 
South and Midwest, followed by the West and Northeast.

Table B-3 presents additional characteristics on the demographic distribution of the 
sample. The average age of respondents was 38 years, while household size averaged 
approximately three members, with less than one person under the age of six. Respondents‘ 
average weekly leisure time was 28 hours. However, this varied significantly across the sample, 
from zero to 168 hours. In the survey, family income is reported as a categorical variable, with 
respondents selecting the income range that reflected family income in the previous year. The 
midpoint of this range was taken to produce a continuous income variable. Subsequently, this 
value was converted to (2000$) using the consumer price index. Median (mean) income was 
estimated to be $57,325 ($66,496) annually.

Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify determinants of travel distance to 
freshwater fishing sites. The dependent variable in this analysis was the miles traveled to the 
most recent freshwater fishing site. The explanatory variables included several demographic and 
geographic characteristics of the respondents. 
Separate regressions were conducted for the full sample (1), single-day trips only (2), and 
multiday trips only (3). The results are reported in Table B-4. Family income was estimated to 
have a positive and highly significant effect in all three models. Dummy variables for urban and 
suburban location were also found to have positive and highly significant effects in all models.  
These results suggest that wealthier anglers and those living in or near metropolitan areas tend to 
travel further to fishing sites, relative to less-wealthy anglers and those living in rural areas. In 
models (1) and (2) dummy variables for the Midwest and West regions also had positive and 
highly significant effects on trip travel distance, relative to the South region. The Northeast 
region did not have a statistically significant effect on distance traveled. Education was estimated 
to be positively and significantly related to distance traveled in the first and second models.  
(Note that the respondent‘s level of education, recorded in the survey as a categorical variable, 
was recoded as a continuous variable for the regression analysis.) Neither age, race, nor gender 
had significant effects (at a 5 percent level) on travel distance in any of the models.

B.3 Summary Results Applied in the Population Centroid Approach 
Given the high significance of geographic area and family income across the regressions, 
nonparametric results (frequency distributions) were generated for four mutually exclusive 
subgroups of respondents and five travel distance categories. The results are reported in 
Table B-5. Respondents were categorized into the four following groups: 
 G1:  family income >$50,000 (in 2000 dollars) and urban or suburban resident 
o (N = 452 for single-day trips) 
o (N = 649 for single- and multiday trips) 
 G2:  family income <$50,000 and urban or suburban resident 
o (N = 329 for single-day trips) 
o (N = 417 for single- and multiday trips) 
 G3:  family income >$50,000 and rural resident 
o (N = 295 for single-day trips 
o (N = 376 for single- and multiday trips) 
 G4:  family income <$50,000 and rural resident 
o (N = 309 for single-day trips) 
o (N = 386 for single- and multiday trips)

These categories were selected because they match categories that can be easily identified 
in Census data and because they split the sample into roughly similar group sizes. Travel 
distance was categorized into ranges reported in the first column of Table B-5. The results are 
consistent with those generated from the regression analysis. Among respondents on single-day 
trips, the number that traveled longer distances (greater than 100 miles) increased from the low-
income rural cohort (5 percent) to the higher-income urban/suburban cohort (11 percent).  The 
 B-6 
same pattern holds for those taking either a single- or multiday trip. The number traveling longer 
distances more than doubled, from 11 percent among low-income rural respondents to 27 percent 
among high-income urban/suburban respondents. These results indicate higher-income 
urban/suburban anglers travel greater distances to freshwater destinations than lower-income 
urban/suburban anglers and rural anglers. 
As described in Section 5.7, the trip frequency estimates reported in Table B-5 for the full 
sample were used in the population centroid approach to weight exposures to mercury in 
fish according to distance from the Census tract centroid, income levels in the tract, and 
whether the tract is predominantly rural or urban/suburban.

Chapter 6  
CO-BENEFITS ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
Synopsis 
This chapter contains a subset of the criteria-pollutant related health and welfare expected 
to occur as a co-benefit of the proposed Toxics Rule in 2016. This rule is expected to yield 
significant reductions in SO2 and NOx from EGUs, which in turn would lower overall ambient 
levels of PM2.5 across much of the eastern U.S. In this chapter we quantify the health and welfare 
co-benefits resulting from these air quality improvements. 
We estimate the monetized co-benefits of the proposed remedy to be $59 billion to $140 
billion at a 3% discount rate and $53 billion to $120 billion at a 7% discount rate in 2016.  All 
estimates are in 2007$. This co-benefits analysis accounts for both decreases and increases in 
emissions across the country resulting from aspects of the proposed provisions of the rule from 
reductions in SO2, NOx and directly emitted PM2.5. These estimates omit the benefits from 
several important categories, including ecosystem benefits and the direct health benefits from 
reducing exposure to tropospheric Ozone, NO2 and SO2 due to time constraints. 
6.1 Overview 
This chapter contains a subset of the estimated health and welfare co-benefits of the 
proposed Toxics Rule in 2016. The Toxics Rule is expected to yield significant net reductions in 
SO2 and NOx from EGUs, which in turn would lower overall ambient levels of PM2.5 and ozone 
across much of the eastern U.S.  The analysis in this chapter aims to characterize the benefits of 
these air quality changes by answering two key questions: 
1. What are the health and welfare effects of changes in ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) 
resulting from reductions in precursors including NOx SO2 and directly-emitted PM2.5? 
2. What is the economic value of these effects? 
In this analysis we consider an array of health and welfare impacts attributable to changes 
in PM2.5 air quality. The 2009 PM2.5 Integrated Science Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2009d) identify 
the human health effects associated with these ambient pollutants, which include premature 
mortality and a variety of morbidity effects associated with acute and chronic exposures. PM 
welfare effects include visibility impairment and materials damage. NOx welfare effects include 
aquatic and terrestrial acidification and nutrient enrichment (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  SO2 welfare 
effects include aquatic and terrestrial acidification and increased mercury methylation (U.S. 
EPA, 2008f).  Though models exist for quantifying these ecosystem impacts, time and resource 
constraints precluded us from quantifying most of those effects in this analysis.

Table 6-1 summarizes the total monetized co-benefits of the proposed rule in 2016.  This 
table reflects the economic value of the change in PM2.5-related human health impacts and the 
monetized value of CO2 reductions occurring as a result of the proposed Toxics Rule. 
Table 6-2 summarizes the human health and welfare benefits categories contained within 
the primary benefits estimate, those categories that were unquantified due to limited data or time.

For notational purposes, unquantified benefits are indicated with a ―B‖ to represent the sum of additional 
monetary benefits and disbenefits. Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these endpoints, and as such, 
these benefits are inherently more uncertain than those benefits that we were able to quantify. A detailed listing of 
unquantified health and welfare effects is provided in Table 6-2. Estimates here are subject to uncertainties 
discussed further in the body of the document. Estimates rounded to two significant figures. Value of total co-
benefits includes CO2-related benefits discounted at 3%.

The co-benefits analysis in this chapter relies on an array of data inputs—including air 
quality modeling, health impact functions and valuation functions among others—which are 
themselves subject to uncertainty and may also in turn contribute to the overall uncertainty in 
this analysis. As a means of characterizing this uncertainty we employ two primary techniques. 
First, we use Monte Carlo methods for characterizing random sampling error associated with the 
concentration response functions from epidemiological studies and economic valuation 
functions. Second, because this characterization of random statistical error may omit important 
sources of uncertainty we also employ the results of an expert elicitation on the relationship 
between premature mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentration (Roman et al., 2008); this 
provides additional insight into the likelihood of different outcomes and about the state of 
 6-3 
knowledge regarding the benefits estimates. Both approaches have different strengths and 
weaknesses, which are fully described in Chapter 5 of the PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
Given that reductions in premature mortality dominate the size of the overall monetized 
co-benefits, more focus on uncertainty in mortality-related benefits gives us greater confidence 
in our uncertainty characterization surrounding total PM2.5-related co-benefits. Certain EPA 
RIA‘s including the 2008 Ozone NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008a) contained a suite of sensitivity 
analyses, only some of which we include here due in part to time constraints. In particular, these 
analyses characterized the sensitivity of the monetized benefits to the specification of alternate 
cessation lags and income growth adjustment factors. The estimated co-benefits increased or 
decreased in proportion to the specification of alternate income growth adjustments and cessation 
lags, making it possible for readers to infer the sensitivity of the results in this RIA to these 
parameters by referring to the PM NAAQS RIA (2006d) and Ozone NAAQS RIA (2008a). 
For example, the use of an alternate lag structure would change the PM2.5-related 
mortality benefits discounted at 3% discounted by between 10.4% and –27%; when discounted at 
7%, these benefits change by between 31% and -49%. When applying higher and lower income 
growth adjustments, the monetary value of PM2.5 -related premature changes between 30% and -
10%; the value of chronic endpoints change between 5% and -2% and the value of acute 
endpoints change between 6% and -7%. 
Consistent with the proposed Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010), we bin the estimated 
number of avoided PM2.5-related premature mortalities resulting from the implementation of the 
Toxics Rule according to the projected 2016 baseline PM2.5 air quality levels (Figures 6-19 to 
6-21). This presentation is consistent with our approach to applying PM2.5 mortality risk 
coefficients that have not been adjusted to incorporate an assumed threshold.  The avoided PM-
related impacts we estimate in this analysis occur predominantly among populations exposed at 
or above the lowest measured air quality level (LML) of each epidemiological study, increasing 
our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. Approximately 30% of the avoided impacts occur at 
or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 µg/m
3
 (the LML of the Laden et al. 2006 study); 
about 85% occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 7.5 µg/m
3 
(the LML of the Pope et 
al. 2002 study). As we model mortality impacts among populations exposed to levels of PM2.5 
that are successively lower than the LML of each study our confidence in the results diminishes. 
However, the analysis below confirms that the great majority of the impacts occur at or above 
each study‘s LML.

 In addition to primary economic endpoints, there are a number of biological responses that have been associated 
with PM health effects including morphological changes and altered host defense mechanisms.  The public health 
impact of these biological responses may be partly represented by our quantified endpoints.

 Cohort estimates are designed to examine the effects of long term exposures to ambient pollution, but relative risk 
estimates may also incorporate some effects due to shorter term exposures (see Kunzli et al., 2001 for a discussion 
of this issue). While some of the effects of short term exposure are likely to be captured by the cohort estimates, 
there may be additional premature mortality from short term PM exposure not captured in the cohort estimates 
included in the primary analysis.

6.2 Benefits Analysis Methods 
We follow a ―damage-function‖ approach in calculating total benefits of the modeled 
changes in environmental quality.  This approach estimates changes in individual health and 
welfare endpoints (specific effects that can be associated with changes in air quality) and assigns 
values to those changes assuming independence of the individual values.  Total benefits are 
calculated simply as the sum of the values for all non-overlapping health and welfare endpoints. 
The ―damage-function‖ approach is the standard method for assessing costs and benefits of 
environmental quality programs and has been used in several recent published analyses (Levy et 
al., 2009; Hubbell et al., 2009; Tagaris et al., 2009). 
To assess economic value in a damage-function framework, the changes in environmental 
quality must be translated into effects on people or on the things that people value.  In some 
 6-6 
cases, the changes in environmental quality can be directly valued, as is the case for changes in 
visibility.  In other cases, such as for changes in ozone and PM, a health and welfare impact 
analysis must first be conducted to convert air quality changes into effects that can be assigned 
dollar values. 
For the purposes of this RIA, the health impacts analysis (HIA) is limited to those health 
effects that are directly linked to ambient levels of air pollution and specifically to those linked to 
ozone and PM.  There may be other, indirect health impacts associated with implementing 
emissions controls, such as occupational health impacts for coal miners. 
The welfare impacts analysis is limited to changes in the environment that have a direct 
impact on human welfare.  For this analysis, we are limited by the available data to examine 
impacts of changes in visibility in Class 1 areas.  We also provide qualitative discussions of the 
impact of changes in other environmental and ecological effects, for example, changes in 
deposition of nitrogen and sulfur to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but we are unable to place 
an economic value on these changes due to time and resource limitations. 
We note at the outset that EPA rarely has the time or resources to perform extensive new 
research to measure directly either the health outcomes or their values for regulatory analyses.  
Thus, similar to Kunzli et al. (2000) and other recent health impact analyses, our estimates are 
based on the best available methods of benefits transfer.  Benefits transfer is the science and art 
of adapting primary research from similar contexts to obtain the most accurate measure of 
benefits for the environmental quality change under analysis.  Adjustments are made for the level 
of environmental quality change, the socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the 
affected population, and other factors to improve the accuracy and robustness of benefits 
estimates. 
6.2.1 Health Impact Assessment 
The Health Impact Assessment (HIA) quantifies the changes in the incidence of adverse 
health impacts resulting from changes in human exposure to PM2.5 and ozone air quality. HIAs 
are a well-established approach for estimating the retrospective or prospective change in adverse 
health impacts expected to result from population-level changes in exposure to pollutants (Levy 
et al. 2009). PC-based tools such as the environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program 
(BenMAP) can systematize health impact analyses by applying a database of key input 
parameters, including health impact functions and population projections. Analysts have applied 
the HIA approach to estimate human health impacts resulting from hypothetical changes in 
pollutant levels (Hubbell et al. 2005; Davidson et al. 2007, Tagaris et al. 2009). EPA and others 
 6-7 
have relied upon this method to predict future changes in health impacts expected to result from 
the implementation of regulations affecting air quality (U.S. EPA, 2008a). 
The HIA approach used in this analysis involves three basic steps: (1) utilizing CAMx-
generated projections of PM2.5 and ozone air quality and estimating the change in the spatial 
distribution of the ambient air quality; (2) determining the subsequent change in population-level 
exposure; (3) calculating health impacts by applying concentration-response relationships drawn 
from the epidemiological literature (Hubbell et al. 2009) to this change in population exposure. 
A typical health impact function might look as follows: 
∆𝑦 = 𝑦𝑜  ∙  𝑒
𝛽∙∆𝑥 −  1 ∙ 𝑃𝑜𝑝 
 
where y0 is the baseline incidence rate for the health endpoint being quantified (for 
example, a health impact function quantifying changes in mortality would use the baseline, or 
background, mortality rate for the given population of interest); Pop is the population affected by 
the change in air quality; x is the change in air quality; and β is the effect coefficient drawn 
from the epidemiological study. Tools such as BenMAP can systematize the HIA calculation 
process, allowing users to draw upon a library of existing air quality monitoring data, population 
data and health impact functions. 
Figure 6-1 provides a simplified overview of this approach. 
 
 6-8 
Figure 6-1. Illustration of BenMAP Approach 
 
6.2.2 Economic Valuation of Health Impacts 
After quantifying the change in adverse health impacts, the final step is to estimate the 
economic value of these avoided impacts. The appropriate economic value for a change in a 
health effect depends on whether the health effect is viewed ex ante (before the effect has 
occurred) or ex post (after the effect has occurred). Reductions in ambient concentrations of air 
pollution generally lower the risk of future adverse health effects by a small amount for a large 
population. The appropriate economic measure is therefore ex ante Willingness to Pay (WTP) for 
changes in risk. However, epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the relative 
risks of a particular health effect avoided due to a reduction in air pollution. A convenient way to 
use this data in a consistent framework is to convert probabilities to units of avoided statistical 
incidences. This measure is calculated by dividing individual WTP for a risk reduction by the 
related observed change in risk. For example, suppose a measure is able to reduce the risk of 
premature mortality from 2 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000 (a reduction of 1 in 10,000). If individual 
WTP for this risk reduction is $100, then the WTP for an avoided statistical premature mortality 
amounts to $1 million ($100/0.0001 change in risk). Using this approach, the size of the affected 
population is automatically taken into account by the number of incidences predicted by 
 6-9 
epidemiological studies applied to the relevant population. The same type of calculation can 
produce values for statistical incidences of other health endpoints. 
For some health effects, such as hospital admissions, WTP estimates are generally not 
available. In these cases, we use the cost of treating or mitigating the effect as a primary 
estimate. For example, for the valuation of hospital admissions we use the avoided medical costs 
as an estimate of the value of avoiding the health effects causing the admission. These cost of 
illness (COI) estimates generally (although not in every case) understate the true value of 
reductions in risk of a health effect. They tend to reflect the direct expenditures related to 
treatment but not the value of avoided pain and suffering from the health effect. 
We use the BenMAP model (Abt Associates, 2008) to estimate the health impacts and 
monetized health benefits for the proposed remedy.  Figure 6-2 below shows the data inputs and 
outputs for the BenMAP model.

6.2.3 Adjusting the Results of the PM2.5 Benefits Analysis to Account for the Emission 
Reductions in the Proposed Rule 
As described in chapter 3 of this RIA, EPA modified the proposed rule requirements after 
the completion of the air quality modeling for this rule. These changes to the rule affected both 
the overall level and distribution of PM2.5 precursor emissions across the U.S., which in turn 
affect the level PM2.5 co-benefits. Time constraints prevented the Agency from modeling the air 
quality changes resulting from this updated emissions scenario.  In the absence of updated air 
quality modeling, we adjusted our benefits estimates to reflect these emission changes by 
applying benefit per-ton estimates. 
Benefit per-ton (BPT) estimates quantify the health impacts and monetized human health 
benefits of an incremental change in air pollution precursor emissions. In circumstances where 
we are unable to perform air quality modeling because of resource or time constraints, this

approach can provide a reasonable estimate of the benefits of emission reduction scenarios. EPA 
has used the benefit per-ton technique in previous RIAs, including the recent Ozone NAAQS 
RIA (U.S. EPA, 2008), the NO2 NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2010b) and the proposed Transport 
rule (U.S. EPA, 2010c). 
For this co-benefits analysis we created per-ton estimates of PM2.5-related incidence- and 
monetized benefits based on the benefits of the air quality modeled scenario. Our approach here 
is methodologically consistent with the technique reported in Fann, Fulcher & Hubbell (2009), 
but adjusted for this analysis to better match the spatial distribution of air quality changes 
expected under the Toxics Rule. To derive the BPT estimates for this analysis, we: 
1. Quantified the human and monetized health benefits of changes in each PM species. We 
first estimated the health impacts and monetized benefits of reductions in directly 
emitted PM2.5, particulate sulfate and particulate nitrate.
1
  We found that, reductions in 
NOx and SOx led to significant decreases in particulate sulfate and small increases in 
particulate nitrate, indicating that nitrate replacement limited the nitrate reductions from 
NOx decreases. Reductions in directly emitted PM2.5 were fairly modest, providing a 
very small change in PM2.5. We elected not to generate a NOx benefit per ton for three 
reasons: (a) reductions in NOx emissions for this rule were relatively small; (b) previous 
EPA modeling indicates that PM2.5 formation is less sensitive to NOx emission 
reductions on a per-µg/m
3
 basis (Fann, Fulcher and Hubbell, 2009); and (c) particulate 
nitrate formation is governed by complex non-linear chemistry that is difficult to 
characterize using benefit per-ton estimates.
2
 
2. Divided the health impacts and monetized benefits by the emission reduction. For the 
reasons described above, we quantified a SO2 benefit per ton estimate alone. By dividing 
the particulate sulfate-related benefits in the eastern and western U.S. by the total SO2-
related emission reductions in these two areas, we generated an array of eastern and 
western benefit per ton estimates. 
                                                 
1 Consistent with advice from the Health Effects Subcommittee of the Science Advisory Board, we assume that each 
PM species is equally toxic. We quantify the change in incidence for each PM specie by applying risk 
coefficients based on undifferentiated PM2.5 mass.  
2 
The Toxics Rule reduces both SO2 and NOx emissions.  In general SO2 is a precursor to particulate sulfate and 
NOx is a precursor to particulate nitrate.  However, there are also several interactions between the PM2.5 
precursors which cannot be easily quantified.  For example, under conditions in which SO2 levels are reduced by 
a substantial margin, ―nitrate replacement‖ may occur.  This occurs when particulate ammonium sulfate 
concentrations are reduced, thereby freeing up excess gaseous ammonia.  The excess ammonia is then available 
to react with gaseous nitric acid to form particulate nitrate when meteorological conditions are conducive (cold 
temperatures and high humidity).  The impact of nitrate replacement is also affected by concurrent NOx 
reductions.  NOx reductions can lead to decreases in nitrate, which competes with the process of nitrate 
replacement.  NOx reductions can also lead to reductions in photochemical by-products which can reduce both 
particulate sulfate and secondary organic carbon PM concentrations.   
 6-12 
The resulting BPT estimates were then multiplied by the projected SO2 emission 
reductions for the proposed Toxics rule scenario to produce an estimate of the PM—related 
health impacts and monetized co-benefits. There is no analogous approach for estimating a BPT 
for visibility, and so the benefits of the alternative remedies omit this important monetized 
benefit, however, in the model scenario (Appendix C), visibility benefits added $2.2B to the 
monetized benefits. 
An implicit assumption in our approach is that the size and distribution of SO2 emissions, 
and the relative levels of NOx and SO2 emissions, are fairly similar in the modeled and revised 
policy cases. While the modeled and revised policy case achieve roughly similar levels of SO2 
reductions (2.35 million tons versus 2.06 million tons, respectively), the modeled case 
concentrates SO2 reductions primarily among a few Midwestern and southeastern states, while 
the revised case distributes SO2 reductions more evenly across both the Midwest, southeast and 
west. Likewise, the modeled case generates the largest NOx reductions in the Midwest, while the 
revised case shifts these reductions to western states including Montana, Colorado and Utah. The 
shifting distribution of NOx and SO2 reductions between the modeled and revised cases are likely 
to affect the overall size of the benefits, a factor that we incompletely account for in our benefit 
per-ton estimates. 
We did not develop an ozone benefit per ton estimate for two reasons. First, the overall 
level of ozone-related benefits in the modeled case is relatively small compared to those 
associated with PM2.5 reductions (see appendix C), due in part to the fairly modest NOx emission 
reductions. Second, the complex non-linear chemistry of ozone formation introduces uncertainty 
to the development and application of a benefit per ton estimate. Taken together, these factors 
argued against developing an ozone benefit per ton estimate for this RIA, especially given the 
shift in the geographic pattern of NOx reductions. 
6.3 Uncertainty Characterization 
In any complex analysis using estimated parameters and inputs from numerous models, 
there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty and this analysis is no exception.  As outlined 
both in this and preceding chapters, many inputs were used to derive the estimate of benefits for 
the proposed remedy, including emission inventories, air quality models (with their associated 
parameters and inputs), epidemiological health effect estimates, estimates of values (both from 
WTP and COI studies), population estimates, income estimates, and estimates of the future state 
of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human behavior).  Each of these inputs may be 
uncertain and, depending on its role in the benefits analysis, may have a disproportionately large 
 6-13 
impact on estimates of total benefits.  For example, emissions estimates are used in the first stage 
of the analysis.  As such, any uncertainty in emissions estimates will be propagated through the 
entire analysis.  When compounded with uncertainty in later stages, small uncertainties in 
emission levels can lead to large impacts on total benefits. 
The National Research Council (NRC) (2002, 2008) highlighted the need for EPA to 
conduct rigorous quantitative analysis of uncertainty in its benefits estimates and to present these 
estimates to decision makers in ways that foster an appropriate appreciation of their inherent 
uncertainty. In general, the NRC concluded that EPA‘s general methodology for calculating the 
benefits of reducing air pollution is reasonable and informative in spite of inherent uncertainties.  
Since the publication of these reports, EPA‘s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) continues to 
make progress toward the goal of characterizing the aggregate impact of uncertainty in key 
modeling elements on both health incidence and benefits estimates in two key ways: Monte 
Carlo analysis and expert-derived concentration-response functions.  In this analysis, we use both 
of these two methods to assess uncertainty quantitatively, as well as provide a qualitative 
assessment for those aspects that we are unable to address quantitatively. 
First, we used Monte Carlo methods for characterizing random sampling error associated 
with the concentration response functions from epidemiological studies and random effects 
modeling to characterize both sampling error and variability across the economic valuation 
functions. Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling from distributions of parameters to 
characterize the effects of uncertainty on output variables, such as incidence of premature 
mortality. Specifically, we used Monte Carlo methods to generate confidence intervals around 
the estimated health impact and dollar benefits. The reported standard errors in the 
epidemiological studies determined the distributions for individual effect estimates. 
Second, because characterization of random statistical error omits important sources of 
uncertainty (e.g., in the functional form of the model—e.g., whether or not a threshold may 
exist), we also incorporate the results of an expert elicitation on the relationship between 
premature mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentration (Roman et al., 2008).  Use of the expert 
elicitation and incorporation of the standard errors approaches provide insights into the 
likelihood of different outcomes and about the state of knowledge regarding the benefits 
estimates. However, there are significant unquantified uncertainties present in upstream inputs 
including emission and air quality. Both approaches have different strengths and weaknesses, 
which are fully described in Chapter 5 of the PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
 6-14 
In benefit analyses of air pollution regulations conducted to date, the estimated impact of 
reductions in premature mortality has accounted for 85% to 95% of total monetized benefits. 
Therefore, it is particularly important to attempt to characterize the uncertainties associated with 
reductions in premature mortality. The health impact functions used to estimate avoided 
premature deaths associated with reductions in ozone have associated standard errors that 
represent the statistical errors around the effect estimates in the underlying epidemiological 
studies. In our results, we report credible intervals based on these standard errors, reflecting the 
uncertainty in the estimated change in incidence of avoided premature deaths. We also provide 
multiple estimates, to reflect model uncertainty between alternative study designs. 
For premature mortality associated with exposure to PM, we follow the same approach 
used in the RIA for 2006 PM NAAQS (U.S. EPA, 2006), presenting two empirical estimates of 
premature deaths avoided, and a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation 
study. Even these multiple characterizations, including confidence intervals, omit the 
contribution to overall uncertainty of uncertainty in air quality changes, baseline incidence rates, 
populations exposed and transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. Furthermore, 
the approach presented here does not yet include methods for addressing correlation between 
input parameters and the identification of reasonable upper and lower bounds for input 
distributions characterizing uncertainty in additional model elements. As a result, the reported 
confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the overall 
uncertainty in the estimates. This information should be interpreted within the context of the 
larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. 
Some key sources of uncertainty in each stage of the PM health impact assessment are 
the following: 
 gaps in scientific data and inquiry; 
 variability in estimated relationships, such as epidemiological effect estimates, 
introduced through differences in study design and statistical modeling; 
 errors in measurement and projection for variables such as population growth rates; 
 errors due to misspecification of model structures, including the use of surrogate 
variables, such as using PM10 when PM2.5 is not available, excluded variables, and 
simplification of complex functions; and 
 biases due to omissions or other research limitations. 
 6-15 
In Table 6-3 we summarize some of the key uncertainties in the benefits analysis. 
Table 6-3. Primary Sources of Uncertainty in the Benefits Analysis 
1.  Uncertainties Associated with Impact Functions 
- The value of the ozone or PM effect estimate in each impact function. 
- Application of a single impact function to pollutant changes and populations in all locations. 
- Similarity of future-year impact functions to current impact functions. 
- Correct functional form of each impact function. 
- Extrapolation of effect estimates beyond the range of ozone or PM concentrations observed in the source 
epidemiological study. 
- Application of impact functions only to those subpopulations matching the original study population. 
2.  Uncertainties Associated with CAMx-Modeled Ozone and PM Concentrations  
- Responsiveness of the models to changes in precursor emissions from the control policy. 
- Projections of future levels of precursor emissions, especially ammonia and crustal materials. 
- Lack of ozone and PM2.5 monitors in all rural areas requires extrapolation of observed ozone data from urban 
to rural areas. 
3.  Uncertainties Associated with PM Mortality Risk 
- Limited scientific literature supporting a direct biological mechanism for observed epidemiological evidence. 
- Direct causal agents within the complex mixture of PM have not been identified. 
- The extent to which adverse health effects are associated with low-level exposures that occur many times in 
the year versus peak exposures. 
- The extent to which effects reported in the long-term exposure studies are associated with historically higher 
levels of PM rather than the levels occurring during the period of study. 
- Reliability of the PM2.5 monitoring data in reflecting actual PM2.5 exposures. 
4.  Uncertainties Associated with Possible Lagged Effects 
- The portion of the PM-related long-term exposure mortality effects associated with changes in annual PM 
levels that would occur in a single year is uncertain as well as the portion that might occur in subsequent 
years. 
5.  Uncertainties Associated with Baseline Incidence Rates 
- Some baseline incidence rates are not location specific (e.g., those taken from studies) and therefore may not 
accurately represent the actual location-specific rates. 
- Current baseline incidence rates may not approximate well baseline incidence rates in 2014. 
- Projected population and demographics may not represent well future-year population and demographics. 
6.  Uncertainties Associated with Economic Valuation 
- Unit dollar values associated with health and welfare endpoints are only estimates of mean WTP and 
therefore have uncertainty surrounding them. 
- Mean WTP (in constant dollars) for each type of risk reduction may differ from current estimates because 
of differences in income or other factors. 
7.  Uncertainties Associated with Aggregation of Monetized Benefits 
- Health and welfare benefits estimates are limited to the available impact functions.  Thus, unquantified or 
unmonetized benefits are not included.

6.4 Benefits Analysis Data Inputs 
In Figure 6-2, we summarized the key data inputs to the health impact and economic 
valuation estimate. Below we summarize the data sources for each of these inputs, including 
demographic projections, effect coefficients, incidence rates and economic valuation. Our 
approach here is generally consistent with the proposed Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010c). 
6.4.1 Demographic Data 
Quantified and monetized human health impacts depend on the demographic 
characteristics of the population, including age, location, and income.  We use projections based 
on economic forecasting models developed by Woods and Poole, Inc (Woods and Poole, 2008).  
The Woods and Poole (WP) database contains county-level projections of population by age, 
sex, and race out to 2030.  Projections in each county are determined simultaneously with every 
other county in the United States to take into account patterns of economic growth and 
migration.  The sum of growth in county-level populations is constrained to equal a previously 
determined national population growth, based on Bureau of Census estimates (Hollman et al., 
2000).  According to WP, linking county-level growth projections together and constraining to a 
national-level total growth avoids potential errors introduced by forecasting each county 
independently.  County projections are developed in a four-stage process: 
1. First, national-level variables such as income, employment, and populations are 
forecasted. 
2. Second, employment projections are made for 172 economic areas defined by the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, using an ―export-base‖ approach, which relies on linking 
industrial-sector production of non-locally consumed production items, such as outputs 
from mining, agriculture, and manufacturing with the national economy.  The export-
based approach requires estimation of demand equations or calculation of historical 
growth rates for output and employment by sector. 
3. Third, population is projected for each economic area based on net migration rates 
derived from employment opportunities and following a cohort-component method based 
on fertility and mortality in each area. 
4. Fourth, employment and population projections are repeated for counties, using the 
economic region totals as bounds.  The age, sex, and race distributions for each region or 
county are determined by aging the population by single year of age by sex and race for 
each year through 2016 based on historical rates of mortality, fertility, and migration. 
6.4.2 Effect Coefficients 
The first step in selecting effect coefficients is to identify the health endpoints to be 
quantified. We base our selection of health endpoints on consistency with EPA‘s Integrated 
 6-17 
Science Assessments (which replace the Criteria Document), with input and advice from the 
EPA Science Advisory Board - Health Effects Subcommittee (SAB-HES), a scientific review 
panel specifically established to provide advice on the use of the scientific literature in 
developing benefits analyses for air pollution regulations (http://www.epa.gov/sab/). In general, 
we follow a weight of evidence approach, based on the biological plausibility of effects, 
availability of concentration-response functions from well conducted peer-reviewed 
epidemiological studies, cohesiveness of results across studies, and a focus on endpoints 
reflecting public health impacts (like hospital admissions) rather than physiological responses 
(such as changes in clinical measures like Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1)). 
There are several types of data that can support the determination of types and magnitude 
of health effects associated with air pollution exposures. These sources of data include 
toxicological studies (including animal and cellular studies), human clinical trials, and 
observational epidemiology studies. All of these data sources provide important contributions to 
the weight of evidence surrounding a particular health impact. However, only epidemiology 
studies provide direct concentration-response relationships which can be used to evaluate 
population-level impacts of reductions in ambient pollution levels in a health impact assessment. 
For the data-derived estimates, we relied on the published scientific literature to ascertain 
the relationship between PM and adverse human health effects. We evaluated epidemiological 
studies using the selection criteria summarized in Table 6-4. These criteria include consideration 
of whether the study was peer-reviewed, the match between the pollutant studied and the 
pollutant of interest, the study design and location, and characteristics of the study population, 
among other considerations. The selection of C-R functions for the benefits analysis is guided by 
the goal of achieving a balance between comprehensiveness and scientific defensibility. In 
general, the use of results from more than a single study can provide a more robust estimate of 
the relationship between a pollutant and a given health effect. However, there are often 
differences between studies examining the same endpoint, making it difficult to pool the results 
in a consistent manner. For example, studies may examine different pollutants or different age 
groups. For this reason, we consider very carefully the set of studies available examining each 
endpoint and select a consistent subset that provides a good balance of population coverage and 
match with the pollutant of interest. In many cases, either because of a lack of multiple studies, 
consistency problems, or clear superiority in the quality or comprehensiveness of one study over 
others, a single published study is selected as the basis of the effect estimate. 
 6-18 
Table 6-4. Criteria Used when Selecting C-R Functions 
Consideration Comments 
Peer-Reviewed 
Research 
Peer-reviewed research is preferred to research that has not undergone the peer-review 
process. 
Study Type 
Among studies that consider chronic exposure (e.g., over a year or longer), prospective 
cohort studies are preferred over ecological studies because they control for important 
individual-level confounding variables that cannot be controlled for in ecological studies.  
Study Period 
Studies examining a relatively longer period of time (and therefore having more data) are 
preferred, because they have greater statistical power to detect effects.  More recent 
studies are also preferred because of possible changes in pollution mixes, medical care, 
and lifestyle over time.  However, when there are only a few studies available, studies 
from all years will be included. 
Population Attributes 
The most technically appropriate measures of benefits would be based on impact functions 
that cover the entire sensitive population but allow for heterogeneity across age or other 
relevant demographic factors.  In the absence of effect estimates specific to age, sex, 
preexisting condition status, or other relevant factors, it may be appropriate to select effect 
estimates that cover the broadest population to match with the desired outcome of the 
analysis, which is total national-level health impacts.  When available, multi-city studies 
are preferred to single city studies because they provide a more generalizable 
representation of the C-R function. 
Study Size 
Studies examining a relatively large sample are preferred because they generally have 
more power to detect small magnitude effects.  A large sample can be obtained in several 
ways, either through a large population or through repeated observations on a smaller 
population (e.g., through a symptom diary recorded for a panel of asthmatic children). 
Study Location 
U.S. studies are more desirable than non-U.S. studies because of potential differences in 
pollution characteristics, exposure patterns, medical care system, population behavior, and 
lifestyle. 
Pollutants Included in 
Model 
When modeling the effects of ozone and PM (or other pollutant combinations) jointly, it is 
important to use properly specified impact functions that include both pollutants.  Using 
single-pollutant models in cases where both pollutants are expected to affect a health 
outcome can lead to double-counting when pollutants are correlated. 
Measure of PM 
For this analysis, impact functions based on PM2.5 are preferred to PM10 because of the 
focus on reducing emissions of PM2.5 precursors, and because air quality modeling was 
conducted for this size fraction of PM.  Where PM2.5 functions are not available, PM10 
functions are used as surrogates, recognizing that there will be potential downward 
(upward) biases if the fine fraction of PM10 is more (less) toxic than the coarse fraction.   
Economically 
Valuable Health 
Effects 
Some health effects, such as forced expiratory volume and other technical measurements 
of lung function, are difficult to value in monetary terms.  These health effects are not 
quantified in this analysis. 
Non-overlapping 
Endpoints 
Although the benefits associated with each individual health endpoint may be analyzed 
separately, care must be exercised in selecting health endpoints to include in the overall 
benefits analysis because of the possibility of double-counting of benefits.  
 
 6-19 
When several effect estimates for a pollutant and a given health endpoint have been 
selected, they are quantitatively combined or pooled to derive a more robust estimate of the 
relationship. The BenMAP Technical Appendices provides details of the procedures used to 
combine multiple impact functions (Abt Associates, 2008). In general, we used fixed or random 
effects models to pool estimates from different studies of the same endpoint. Fixed effects 
pooling simply weights each study‘s estimate by the inverse variance, giving more weight to 
studies with greater statistical power (lower variance). Random effects pooling accounts for both 
within-study variance and between-study variability, due, for example, to differences in 
population susceptibility. We used the fixed effects model as our null hypothesis and then 
determined whether the data suggest that we should reject this null hypothesis, in which case we 
would use the random effects model. Pooled impact functions are used to estimate hospital 
admissions and asthma exacerbations. For more details on methods used to pool incidence 
estimates, see the BenMAP Manual Appendices (Abt Associates, 2008), which are available 
with the BenMAP software at http://www.epa.gov/benmap.html. 
Effect estimates selected for a given health endpoint were applied consistently across all 
locations nationwide. This applies to both impact functions defined by a single effect estimate 
and those defined by a pooling of multiple effect estimates. Although the effect estimate may, in 
fact, vary from one location to another (e.g., because of differences in population susceptibilities 
or differences in the composition of PM), location-specific effect estimates are generally not 
available. 
The specific studies from which effect estimates for the primary analysis are drawn are 
included in Table 6-5. We highlight in blue those studies that have been added since the 2005 
CAIR benefits analysis and incorporated into the central benefits estimate. In all cases where 
effect estimates are drawn directly from epidemiological studies, standard errors are used as a 
partial representation of the uncertainty in the size of the effect estimate. Below we provide the 
basis for selecting these studies.

6.4.2.1 PM2.5 Premature Mortality Effect Coefficients 
Both long- and short-term exposures to ambient levels of PM2.5 air pollution have been 
associated with increased risk of premature mortality. The size of the mortality risk estimates 
from epidemiological studies, the serious nature of the effect itself, and the high monetary value 
ascribed to prolonging life make mortality risk reduction the most significant health endpoint 
quantified in this analysis. 
Although a number of uncertainties remain to be addressed by continued research (NRC, 
2002), a substantial body of published scientific literature documents the correlation between 
elevated PM2.5 concentrations and increased mortality rates (U.S. EPA, 2009d). Time-series 
methods have been used to relate short-term (often day-to-day) changes in PM2.5 concentrations 
and changes in daily mortality rates up to several days after a period of elevated PM2.5 
concentrations. Cohort methods have been used to examine the potential relationship between 
 6-22 
community-level PM exposures over multiple years (i.e., long-term exposures) and community-
level annual mortality rates. Researchers have found statistically significant associations between 
PM2.5 and premature mortality using both types of studies. In general, the risk estimates based on 
the cohort studies are larger than those derived from time-series studies. Cohort analyses are 
thought to better capture the full public health impact of exposure to air pollution over time, 
because they account for the effects of long-term exposures and possibly some component of 
short-term exposures (Kunzli et al., 2001; NRC, 2002). This section discusses some of the issues 
surrounding the estimation of PM2.5-related premature mortality. To demonstrate the sensitivity 
of the benefits estimates to the specific sources of information regarding the impact of PM2.5 
exposures on the risk of premature death, we are providing estimates in our results tables based 
on studies derived from the epidemiological literature and from the EPA sponsored expert 
elicitation. The epidemiological studies from which these estimates are drawn are described 
below. The expert elicitation project and the derivation of effect estimates from the expert 
elicitation results are described in the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and Roman et al. (2008). In the 
interest of brevity we do not repeat those details here. However, Figure 6-13 summarizes the 
estimated PM2.5-related premature mortalities avoided using risk estimates drawn from the expert 
elicitation. 
Over a dozen epidemiological studies have found significant associations between 
various measures of long-term exposure to PM and elevated rates of annual mortality, beginning 
with Lave and Seskin (1977). Most of the published studies found positive (but not always 
statistically significant) associations with available PM indices such as total suspended particles 
(TSP). However, exploration of alternative model specifications sometimes raised questions 
about causal relationships (e.g., Lipfert et al., 1989). These early ―ecological cross-sectional‖ 
studies (Lave and Seskin, 1977; Ozkaynak and Thurston, 1987) were criticized for a number of 
methodological limitations, particularly for inadequate control at the individual level for 
variables that are potentially important in causing mortality, such as wealth, smoking, and diet. 
Over the last 17 years, several studies using ―prospective cohort‖ designs have been 
published that appear to be consistent with the earlier body of literature. These new ―prospective 
cohort‖ studies reflect a significant improvement over the earlier work because they include 
individual level information with respect to health status and residence. The most extensive 
analyses have been based on data from two prospective cohort groups, often referred to as the 
Harvard ―Six-Cities Study‖ (Dockery et al., 1993; Laden et al., 2006) and the ―American Cancer 
Society or ACS study‖ (Pope et al., 1995; Pope et al., 2002; Pope et al., 2004, Krewski et al. 
2009); these studies have found consistent relationships between fine particle indicators and 
 6-23 
premature mortality across multiple locations in the United States. A third major data set comes 
from the California-based 7th Day Adventist Study (e.g., Abbey et al., 1999), which reported 
associations between long-term PM exposure and mortality in men. Results from this cohort, 
however, have been inconsistent, and the air quality results are not geographically representative 
of most of the United States, and the lifestyle of the population is not reflective of much of the 
U.S. population. Analysis is also available for a cohort of adult male veterans diagnosed with 
hypertension has been examined (Lipfert et al., 2000; Lipfert et al., 2003, 2006). The 
characteristics of this group differ from the cohorts in the Six-Cities, ACS, and 7th Day 
Adventist studies with respect to income, race, health status, and smoking status. Unlike previous 
long-term analyses, this study found some associations between mortality and ozone but found 
inconsistent results for PM indicators. Because of the selective nature of the population in the 
veteran‘s cohort, we have chosen not to include any effect estimates from the Lipfert et al. 
(2000) study in our benefits assessment. 
Given their consistent results and broad geographic coverage, and importance in 
informing the NAAQS development process, the Six-Cities and ACS data have been particularly 
important in benefits analyses. The credibility of these two studies is further enhanced by the fact 
that the initial published studies (Pope et al., 1995 and Dockery et al., 1993) were subject to 
extensive reexamination and reanalysis by an independent team of scientific experts 
commissioned by the Health Effect Institute (HEI) (Krewski et al., 2000). The final results of the 
reanalysis were then independently peer reviewed by a Special Panel of the HEI Health Review 
Committee. The results of these reanalyses confirmed and expanded the conclusions of the 
original investigators. While the HEI reexamination lends credibility to the original studies, it 
also highlights sensitivities concerning the relative impact of various pollutants, such as SO2, the 
potential role of education in mediating the association between pollution and mortality, and the 
influence of spatial correlation modeling. Further confirmation and extension of the findings of 
the 1993 Six City Study and the 1995 ACS study were recently completed using more recent air 
quality and a longer follow-up period for the ACS cohort was published over the past several 
years (Pope et al., 2002, 2004; Laden et al., 2006, Krewski et al. 2009). The follow up to the 
Harvard Six City Study both confirmed the effect size from the first analysis and provided 
additional confirmation that reductions in PM2.5 are likely to result in reductions in the risk of 
premature death. This additional evidence stems from the observed reductions in PM2.5 in each 
city during the extended follow-up period. Laden et al. (2006) found that mortality rates 
consistently went down at a rate proportionate to the observed reductions in PM2.5. 
 6-24 
A number of additional analyses have been conducted on the ACS cohort data (Jarrett et 
al., 2009; Pope et al., 2009). These studies have continued to find a strong significant 
relationship between PM2.5 and mortality outcomes and life expectancy. Specifically, much of 
the recent research has suggested a stronger relationship between cardiovascular mortality and 
lung cancer mortality with PM2.5, and a less significant relationship between respiratory-related 
mortality and PM2.5. The extended analyses of the ACS cohort data (Krewski et al. 2009) 
provides additional refinements to the analysis of PM-related mortality by (a) extend the follow-
up period by 2 years to the year 2000, for a total of 18 years; (b) incorporate ecological., or 
neighborhood-level co-variates so as to better estimate personal exposure; (c) perform an 
extensive spatial analysis using land use regression modeling. These additional refinements may 
make this analysis well-suited for the assessment of PM-related mortality for EPA benefits 
analyses. 
In developing and improving the methods for estimating and valuing the potential 
reductions in mortality risk over the years, EPA consulted with the SAB-HES. That panel 
recommended using long-term prospective cohort studies in estimating mortality risk reduction 
(U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999b). This recommendation has been confirmed by a report from the 
National Research Council, which stated that ―it is essential to use the cohort studies in benefits 
analysis to capture all important effects from air pollution exposure‖ (NRC, 2002, p. 108). More 
specifically, the SAB recommended emphasis on the ACS study because it includes a much 
larger sample size and longer exposure interval and covers more locations (e.g., 50 cities 
compared to the Six Cities Study) than other studies of its kind. Because of the refinements in the 
extended follow-up analysis, the SAB-HES recommended using the Pope et al. (2002) study as 
the basis for the primary mortality estimate for adults and suggests that alternate estimates of 
mortality generated using other cohort and time-series studies could be included as part of the 
sensitivity analysis (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004b). The PM NAAQS Risk and Exposure Assessment 
(U.S. EPA, 2010) utilized risk coefficients drawn from the Krewski et al. (2009) study. In a 
December of 2009 consultation with the SAB-HES, the Agency proposed utilizing the Krewski 
et al. (2009) extended analysis of the ACS cohort data. The panel is scheduled to issue an 
advisory in early 2010. 
As noted above, since 2004 SAB review, an extended follow-up of the Harvard Six cities 
study has been published (Laden et al., 2006) and in recent RIAs (see for example the SO2 
NAAQS, PM NAAQS, CAIR and Nonroad Diesel RIAs), we have included this estimate of 
mortality impacts based on application of the C-R function derived from this study. We use this 
specific estimate to represent the Six Cities study because it both reflects among the most up-to-
 6-25 
date science and was cited by many of the experts in their elicitation responses. It is clear from 
the expert elicitation that the results published in Laden et al. (2006) are potentially influential, 
and in fact the expert elicitation results encompass within their range the estimates from both the 
Pope et al. (2002) and Laden et al. (2006) studies (see Figure 6-13 below). These are logical 
choices for anchor points in our presentation because, while both studies are well designed and 
peer reviewed, there are strengths and weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for 
using both studies to generate  benefits estimates. 
6.4.2.2 Chronic Bronchitis 
CB is characterized by mucus in the lungs and a persistent wet cough for at least 3 
months a year for several years in a row.  CB affects an estimated 5 percent of the U.S. 
population (American Lung Association, 1999).  A limited number of studies have estimated the 
impact of air pollution on new incidences of CB.  Schwartz (1993) and Abbey et al. (1995) 
provide evidence that long-term PM exposure gives rise to the development of CB in the United 
States.  Because the Toxics Rule is expected to reduce PM2.5, this analysis uses only the Abbey 
et al. (1995) study, because it is the only study focusing on the relationship between PM2.5 and 
new incidences of CB. 
Nonfatal Myocardial Infarctions (Heart Attacks) 
Nonfatal heart attacks have been linked with short-term exposures to PM2.5 in the United 
States (Peters et al., 2001) and other countries (Poloniecki et al., 1997).  We used a recent study 
by Peters et al. (2001) as the basis for the impact function estimating the relationship between 
PM2.5 and nonfatal heart attacks.  Peters et al. is the only available U.S. study to provide a 
specific estimate for heart attacks.  Other studies, such as Samet et al. (2000) and Moolgavkar 
(2000), show a consistent relationship between all cardiovascular hospital admissions, including 
those for nonfatal heart attacks, and PM.  Given the lasting impact of a heart attack on long-term 
health costs and earnings, we provide a separate estimate for nonfatal heart attacks.  The estimate 
used in the Toxics Rule analysis is based on the single available U.S. effect estimate.  The 
finding of a specific impact on heart attacks is consistent with hospital admission and other 
studies showing relationships between fine particles and cardiovascular effects both within and 
outside the United States. Several epidemiologic studies (Liao et al., 1999; Gold et al., 2000; 
Magari et al., 2001) have shown that heart rate variability (an indicator of how much the heart is 
able to speed up or slow down in response to momentary stresses) is negatively related to PM 
levels.  Heart rate variability is a risk factor for heart attacks and other coronary heart diseases 
(Carthenon et al., 2002; Dekker et al., 2000; Liao et al., 1997; Tsuji et al., 1996).  As such, 
 6-26 
significant impacts of PM on heart rate variability are consistent with an increased risk of heart 
attacks. 
Hospital and Emergency Room Admissions 
Because of the availability of detailed hospital admission and discharge records, there is 
an extensive body of literature examining the relationship between hospital admissions and air 
pollution.  Because of this, many of the hospital admission endpoints use pooled impact 
functions based on the results of a number of studies.  In addition, some studies have examined 
the relationship between air pollution and emergency room visits.  Since most emergency room 
visits do not result in an admission to the hospital (the majority of people going to the emergency 
room are treated and return home), we treat hospital admissions and emergency room visits 
separately, taking account of the fraction of emergency room visits that are admitted to the 
hospital. 
The two main groups of hospital admissions estimated in this analysis are respiratory 
admissions and cardiovascular admissions.  There is not much evidence linking ozone or PM 
with other types of hospital admissions.  The only type of emergency room visits that have been 
consistently linked to ozone and PM in the United States are asthma-related visits. 
To estimate avoided incidences of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with 
PM2.5, we used studies by Moolgavkar (2003) and Ito (2003).  Additional published studies show 
a statistically significant relationship between PM10 and cardiovascular hospital admissions.  
However, given that the control options we are analyzing are expected to reduce primarily PM2.5, 
we focus on the two studies that examine PM2.5.  Both of these studies provide an effect estimate 
for populations over 65, allowing us to pool the impact functions for this age group.  Only 
Moolgavkar (2000) provided a separate effect estimate for populations 20 to 64.
1
  Total 
cardiovascular hospital admissions are thus the sum of the pooled estimate for populations over 
65 and the single study estimate for populations 20 to 64.  Cardiovascular hospital admissions 
include admissions for myocardial infarctions.  To avoid double-counting benefits from 
reductions in myocardial infarctions when applying the impact function for cardiovascular 
hospital admissions, we first adjusted the baseline cardiovascular hospital admissions to remove 
admissions for myocardial infarctions.

Note that the Moolgavkar (2000) study has not been updated to reflect the more stringent GAM convergence 
criteria.  However, given that no other estimates are available for this age group, we chose to use the existing 
study.  Given the very small (<5 percent) difference in the effect estimates for people 65 and older with 
cardiovascular hospital admissions between the original and reanalyzed results, we do not expect this choice to 
introduce much bias. 
 6-27 
To estimate total avoided incidences of respiratory hospital admissions, we used impact 
functions for several respiratory causes, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), pneumonia, and asthma.  As with cardiovascular admissions, additional published 
studies show a statistically significant relationship between PM10 and respiratory hospital 
admissions.  We used only those focusing on PM2.5.  Both Moolgavkar (2000) and Ito (2003) 
provide effect estimates for COPD in populations over 65, allowing us to pool the impact 
functions for this group.  Only Moolgavkar (2000) provides a separate effect estimate for 
populations 20 to 64.  Total COPD hospital admissions are thus the sum of the pooled estimate 
for populations over 65 and the single study estimate for populations 20 to 64.  Only Ito (2003) 
estimated pneumonia and only for the population 65 and older.  In addition, Sheppard (2003) 
provided an effect estimate for asthma hospital admissions for populations under age 65.  Total 
avoided incidences of PM-related respiratory-related hospital admissions are the sum of COPD, 
pneumonia, and asthma admissions. 
To estimate the effects of PM air pollution reductions on asthma-related ER visits, we use 
the effect estimate from a study of children 18 and under by Norris et al. (1999).  As noted 
earlier, there is another study by Schwartz examining a broader age group (less than 65), but the 
Schwartz study focused on PM10 rather than PM2.5.  We selected the Norris et al. (1999) effect 
estimate because it better matched the pollutant of interest.  Because children tend to have higher 
rates of hospitalization for asthma relative to adults under 65, we will likely capture the majority 
of the impact of PM2.5 on asthma emergency room visits in populations under 65, although there 
may still be significant impacts in the adult population under 65. 
To estimate avoided incidences of respiratory hospital admissions associated with ozone, 
we used a number of studies examining hospital admissions for a range of respiratory illnesses, 
including pneumonia and COPD.  Two age groups, adults over 65 and children under 2, were 
examined.  For adults over 65, Schwartz (1995) provides effect estimates for two different cities 
relating ozone and hospital admissions for all respiratory causes (defined as ICD codes 460–
519).  Impact functions based on these studies were pooled first before being pooled with other 
studies.  Two studies (Moolgavkar et al., 1997; Schwartz, 1994a) examine ozone and pneumonia 
hospital admissions in Minneapolis.  One additional study (Schwartz, 1994b) examines ozone 
and pneumonia hospital admissions in Detroit.  The impact functions for Minneapolis were 
pooled together first, and the resulting impact function was then pooled with the impact function 
for Detroit.  This avoids assigning too much weight to the information coming from one city.  
For COPD hospital admissions, two studies are available:  Moolgavkar et al. (1997), conducted 
in Minneapolis, and Schwartz (1994b), conducted in Detroit.  These two studies were pooled 
 6-28 
together.  To estimate total respiratory hospital admissions for adults over 65, COPD admissions 
were added to pneumonia admissions, and the result was pooled with the Schwartz (1995) 
estimate of total respiratory admissions.  Burnett et al. (2001) is the only study providing an 
effect estimate for respiratory hospital admissions in children under 2. 
We used two studies as the source of the concentration-response functions we used to 
estimate the effects of ozone exposure on asthma-related emergency room (ER) visits: Peel et al. 
(2005) and Wilson et al. (2005). We estimated the change in ER visits using the effect 
estimate(s) from each study and then pooled the results using the random effects pooling 
technique (see Abt, 2005). The Peel et al. study (2005) estimated asthma-related ER visits for all 
ages in Atlanta, using air quality data from 1993 to 2000. Using Poisson generalized estimating 
equations, the authors found a marginal association between the maximum daily 8-hour average 
ozone level and ER visits for asthma over a 3-day moving average (lags of 0, 1, and 2 days) in a 
single pollutant model. Wilson et al. (2005) examined the relationship between ER visits for 
respiratory illnesses and asthma and air pollution for all people residing in Portland, Maine from 
1998–2000 and Manchester, New Hampshire from 1996–2000. For all models used in the 
analysis, the authors restricted the ozone data incorporated into the model to the months ozone 
levels are usually measured, the spring-summer months (April through September). Using the 
generalized additive model, Wilson et al. (2005) found a significant association between the 
maximum daily 8-hour average ozone level and ER visits for asthma in Portland, but found no 
significant association for Manchester. Similar to the approach used to generate effect estimates 
for hospital admissions, we used random effects pooling to combine the results across the 
individual study estimates for ER visits for asthma. The Peel et al. (2005) and Wilson et al. 
(2005) Manchester estimates were not significant at the 95 percent level, and thus, the 
confidence interval for the pooled incidence estimate based on these studies includes negative 
values. This is an artifact of the statistical power of the studies, and the negative values in the 
tails of the estimated effect distributions do not represent improvements in health as ozone 
concentrations are increased. Instead, these should be viewed as a measure of uncertainty due to 
limitations in the statistical power of the study. We included both hospital admissions and ER 
visits as separate endpoints associated with ozone exposure because our estimates of hospital 
admission costs do not include the costs of ER visits and most asthma ER visits do not result in a 
hospital admission. 
Acute Health Events and School/Work Loss Days 
In addition to mortality, chronic illness, and hospital admissions, a number of acute 
health effects not requiring hospitalization are associated with exposure to ambient levels of 
 6-29 
ozone and PM.  The sources for the effect estimates used to quantify these effects are described 
below. 
Around 4 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 5 and 17 experience episodes of 
acute bronchitis annually (American Lung Association, 2002c).  Acute bronchitis is 
characterized by coughing, chest discomfort, slight fever, and extreme tiredness, lasting for a 
number of days.  According to the MedlinePlus medical encyclopedia,
1
 with the exception of 
cough, most acute bronchitis symptoms abate within 7 to 10 days.  Incidence of episodes of acute 
bronchitis in children between the ages of 5 and 17 were estimated using an effect estimate 
developed from Dockery et al. (1996). 
Incidences of lower respiratory symptoms (e.g., wheezing, deep cough) in children aged 
7 to 14 were estimated using an effect estimate from Schwartz and Neas (2000). 
Because asthmatics have greater sensitivity to stimuli (including air pollution), children 
with asthma can be more susceptible to a variety of upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny or 
stuffy nose; wet cough; and burning, aching, or red eyes).  Research on the effects of air 
pollution on upper respiratory symptoms has thus focused on effects in asthmatics.  Incidences of 
upper respiratory symptoms in asthmatic children aged 9 to 11 are estimated using an effect 
estimate developed from Pope et al. (1991). 
Health effects from air pollution can also result in missed days of work (either from 
personal symptoms or from caring for a sick family member).  Days of work lost due to PM2.5 
were estimated using an effect estimate developed from Ostro (1987).  Children may also be 
absent from school because of respiratory or other diseases caused by exposure to air pollution.  
Most studies examining school absence rates have found little or no association with PM2.5, but 
several studies have found a significant association between ozone levels and school absence 
rates.  We used two recent studies, Gilliland et al. (2001) and Chen et al. (2000), to estimate 
changes in absences (school loss days) due to changes in ozone levels.  The Gilliland et al. study 
estimated the incidence of new periods of absence, while the Chen et al. study examined absence 
on a given day.  We converted the Gilliland estimate to days of absence by multiplying the 
absence periods by the average duration of an absence.  We estimated an average duration of 
school absence of 1.6 days by dividing the average daily school absence rate from Chen et al. 
(2000) and Ransom and Pope (1992) by the episodic absence rate from Gilliland et al. (2001).

 6-30 
This provides estimates from Chen et al. (2000) and Gilliland et al. (2001), which can be pooled 
to provide an overall estimate. 
MRAD result when individuals reduce most usual daily activities and replace them with 
less strenuous activities or rest, yet not to the point of missing work or school.  For example, a 
mechanic who would usually be doing physical work most of the day will instead spend the day 
at a desk doing paper and phone work because of difficulty breathing or chest pain.  The effect of 
PM2.5 and ozone on MRAD was estimated using an effect estimate derived from Ostro and 
Rothschild (1989). 
For the Toxics Rule, we have followed the SAB-HES recommendations regarding asthma 
exacerbations in developing the primary estimate.  To prevent double-counting, we focused the 
estimation on asthma exacerbations occurring in children and excluded adults from the 
calculation.
1
  Asthma exacerbations occurring in adults are assumed to be captured in the general 
population endpoints such as work loss days and MRADs.  Consequently, if we had included an 
adult-specific asthma exacerbation estimate, we would likely double-count incidence for this 
endpoint.  However, because the general population endpoints do not cover children (with regard 
to asthmatic effects), an analysis focused specifically on asthma exacerbations for children (6 to 
18 years of age) could be conducted without concern for double-counting. 
To characterize asthma exacerbations in children, we selected two studies (Ostro et al., 
2001; Vedal et al., 1998) that followed panels of asthmatic children.  Ostro et al. (2001) followed 
a group of 138 African-American children in Los Angeles for 13 weeks, recording daily 
occurrences of respiratory symptoms associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., shortness of 
breath, wheeze, and cough).  This study found a statistically significant association between 
                                                 
1
 Estimating asthma exacerbations associated with air pollution exposures is difficult, due to concerns about double 
counting of benefits.  Concerns over double counting stem from the fact that studies of the general population also 
include asthmatics, so estimates based solely on the asthmatic population cannot be directly added to the general 
population numbers without double counting.  In one specific case (upper respiratory symptoms in children), the 
only study available is limited to asthmatic children, so this endpoint can be readily included in the calculation of 
total benefits.  However, other endpoints, such as lower respiratory symptoms and MRADs, are estimated for the 
total population that includes asthmatics.  Therefore, to simply add predictions of asthma-related symptoms 
generated for the population of asthmatics to these total population-based estimates could result in double 
counting, especially if they evaluate similar endpoints.  The SAB-HES, in commenting on the analytical blueprint 
for 812, acknowledged these challenges in evaluating asthmatic symptoms and appropriately adding them into the 
primary analysis (SAB-HES, 2004).  However, despite these challenges, the SAB-HES recommends the addition 
of asthma-related symptoms (i.e., asthma exacerbations) to the primary analysis, provided that the studies use the 
panel study approach and that they have comparable design and baseline frequencies in both asthma prevalence 
and exacerbation rates.  Note also, that the SAB-HES, while supporting the incorporation of asthma exacerbation 
estimates, does not believe that the association between ambient air pollution, including ozone and PM, and the 
new onset of asthma is sufficiently strong to support inclusion of this asthma-related endpoint in the primary 
estimate.   
 6-31 
PM2.5, measured as a 12-hour average, and the daily prevalence of shortness of breath and 
wheeze endpoints.  Although the association was not statistically significant for cough, the 
results were still positive and close to significance; consequently, we decided to include this 
endpoint, along with shortness of breath and wheeze, in generating incidence estimates (see 
below).  Vedal et al. (1998) followed a group of elementary school children, including 74 
asthmatics, located on the west coast of Vancouver Island for 18 months including measurements 
of daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) and the tracking of respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, 
phlegm, wheeze, chest tightness) through the use of daily diaries.  Association between PM10 and 
respiratory symptoms for the asthmatic population was only reported for two endpoints:  cough 
and PEF.  Because it is difficult to translate PEF measures into clearly defined health endpoints 
that can be monetized, we only included the cough-related effect estimate from this study in 
quantifying asthma exacerbations.  We employed the following pooling approach in combining 
estimates generated using effect estimates from the two studies to produce a single asthma 
exacerbation incidence estimate.  First, we pooled the separate incidence estimates for shortness 
of breath, wheeze, and cough generated using effect estimates from the Ostro et al. study, 
because each of these endpoints is aimed at capturing the same overall endpoint (asthma 
exacerbations) and there could be overlap in their predictions.  The pooled estimate from the 
Ostro et al. study is then pooled with the cough-related estimate generated using the Vedal study.  
The rationale for this second pooling step is similar to the first; both studies are attempting to 
quantify the same overall endpoint (asthma exacerbations). 
6.4.3 Baseline Incidence Estimates 
Epidemiological studies of the association between pollution levels and adverse health 
effects generally provide a direct estimate of the relationship of air quality changes to the relative 
risk of a health effect, rather than estimating the absolute number of avoided cases. For example, 
a typical result might be that a 10 ppb decrease in daily ozone levels might, in turn, decrease 
hospital admissions by 3 percent. The baseline incidence of the health effect is necessary to 
convert this relative change into a number of cases. A baseline incidence rate is the estimate of 
the number of cases of the health effect per year in the assessment location, as it corresponds to 
baseline pollutant levels in that location. To derive the total baseline incidence per year, this rate 
must be multiplied by the corresponding population number. For example, if the baseline 
incidence rate is the number of cases per year per million people, that number must be multiplied 
by the millions of people in the total population. 
Table 6-6 summarizes the sources of baseline incidence rates and provides average 
incidence rates for the endpoints included in the analysis. For both baseline incidence and 
 6-32 
prevalence data, we used age-specific rates where available. We applied concentration-response 
functions to individual age groups and then summed over the relevant age range to provide an 
estimate of total population benefits. In most cases, we used a single national incidence rate, due 
to a lack of more spatially disaggregated data. Whenever possible, the national rates used are 
national averages, because these data are most applicable to a national assessment of benefits. 
For some studies, however, the only available incidence information comes from the studies 
themselves; in these cases, incidence in the study population is assumed to represent typical 
incidence at the national level. Regional incidence rates are available for hospital admissions, 
and county-level data are available for premature mortality. We have projected mortality rates 
such that future mortality rates are consistent with our projections of population growth (Abt 
Associates, 2008); this represents a change from the 2005 CAIR analysis, which used static rates. 
For the set of endpoints affecting the asthmatic population, in addition to baseline 
incidence rates, prevalence rates of asthma in the population are needed to define the applicable 
population.  Table 6-7 lists the prevalence rates used to determine the applicable population for 
asthma symptom endpoints.  Note that these reflect current asthma prevalence and assume no 
change in prevalence rates in future years. EPA is aware that more current estimates of asthma 
prevalence are available from the American Lung Association. However, we applied these older 
rates to maintain methodological consistency with the proposed Transport Rule. We anticipate 
incorporating more recent prevalence rates for the RIA accompanying the rule; other things 
being equal, the newer rates would result in a larger overall estimate of asthma-related impacts.

6.4.4 Economic Valuation Estimates 
Reductions in ambient concentrations of air pollution generally lower the risk of future 
adverse health effects for a large population. Therefore, the appropriate economic measure is 
WTP for changes in risk of a health effect rather than WTP for a health effect that would occur 
with certainty (Freeman, 1993). Epidemiological studies generally provide estimates of the 
relative risks of a particular health effect that is avoided because of a reduction in air pollution. 
We converted those to units of avoided statistical incidence for ease of presentation. We 
calculated the value of avoided statistical incidences by dividing individual WTP for a risk 
reduction by the related observed change in risk. 
WTP estimates generally are not available for some health effects, such as hospital 
admissions. In these cases, we used the cost of treating or mitigating the effect as a primary 
estimate. These cost-of-illness (COI) estimates generally understate the true value of reducing 
the risk of a health effect, because they reflect the direct expenditures related to treatment, but 
not the value of avoided pain and suffering (Harrington and Portney, 1987; Berger, 1987). We 
provide unit values for health endpoints (along with information on the distribution of the unit 
value) in Table 6-8. All values are in constant year 2006 dollars, adjusted for growth in real 
income out to 2016 using projections provided by Standard and Poor‘s. Economic theory argues 
that WTP for most goods (such as environmental protection) will increase if real income 
increases. Many of the valuation studies used in this analysis were conducted in the late 1980s 
 6-35 
and early 1990s. Because real income has grown since the studies were conducted, people‘s 
willingness to pay for reductions in the risk of premature death and disease likely has grown as 
well. We did not adjust cost of illness-based values because they are based on current costs. 
Similarly, we did not adjust the value of school absences, because that value is based on current 
wage rates. For these two reasons, these cost of illness estimates may underestimate the 
economic value of avoided health impacts in 2016. The discussion below provides additional 
details on ozone and PM2.5-related related endpoints. 
Mortality Valuation 
Following the advice of the EEAC of the SAB, EPA currently uses the VSL approach in 
calculating the primary estimate of mortality benefits, because we believe this calculation 
provides the most reasonable single estimate of an individual‘s willingness to trade off money 
for reductions in mortality risk (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2000).  The VSL approach is a summary 
measure for the value of small changes in mortality risk experienced by a large number of 
people.  For a period of time (2004-2008), the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued 
mortality risk reductions using a value of statistical life (VSL) estimate derived from a limited 
analysis of some of the available studies.  OAR arrived at a VSL using a range of $1 million to 
$10 million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of the wage-risk literature.  The $1 
million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range from the Mrozek and Taylor 
(2002) meta-analysis of 33 studies.  The $10 million value represented the upper end of the 
interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-analysis of 43 studies.  The mean 
estimate of $5.5 million (2000$) was also consistent with the mean VSL of $5.4 million 
estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-analysis.  However, the Agency neither changed its 
official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected the interim estimate to a 
scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board (SAB) or other peer-review 
group. 
During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 
risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources.  In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue.  With input from the 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and 
different studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated 
preference) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2007). 
 6-36 
Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received.  Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)
1
 while the Agency continues its efforts to 
update its guidance on this issue.  This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates 
derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 
1991.  The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).
2
  The Agency is committed to 
using scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing mortality risk reductions 
and has made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC‘s specific recommendations.  
The Agency anticipates presenting results from this effort to the SAB-EEAC in Spring 2010 and 
that draft guidance will be available shortly thereafter. 
As indicated in the previous section on quantification of premature mortality benefits, we 
assumed for this analysis that some of the incidences of premature mortality related to PM 
exposures occur in a distributed fashion over the 20 years following exposure.  To take this into 
account in the valuation of reductions in premature mortality, we applied an annual 3% discount 
rate to the value of premature mortality occurring in future years.
3
 
The economics literature concerning the appropriate method for valuing reductions in 
premature mortality risk is still developing.  The adoption of a value for the projected reduction 
in the risk of premature mortality is the subject of continuing discussion within the economics 
and public policy analysis community.  EPA strives to use the best economic science in its 
analyses.  Given the mixed theoretical finding and empirical evidence regarding adjustments to 
VSL for risk and population characteristics, we use a single VSL for all reductions in mortality 
risk. 
Although there are several differences between the labor market studies EPA uses to 
derive a VSL estimate and the PM air pollution context addressed here, those differences in the 
                                                 
1
 In the (draft) update of the Economic Guidelines (U.S. EPA, 2008d), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by the SAB 
with the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be forthcoming in the 
near future.  Therefore, this report does not represent final agency policy.   
2
  In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2006$) and to account for income 
growth to 2014.  After applying these adjustments to the $6.3 million value, the VSL is $7.8M.   
3
 The choice of a discount rate, and its associated conceptual basis, is a topic of ongoing discussion within the 
federal government.  EPA adopted a 3% discount rate for its base estimate in this case to reflect reliance on a 
―social rate of time preference‖ discounting concept.  We have also calculated benefits and costs using a 7% rate 
consistent with an ―opportunity cost of capital‖ concept to reflect the time value of resources directed to meet 
regulatory requirements.  In this case, the benefit and cost estimates were not significantly affected by the choice 
of discount rate.  Further discussion of this topic appears in EPA‘s Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses 
(EPA, 2010). 
 6-37 
affected populations and the nature of the risks imply both upward and downward adjustments.  
Table 6-11 lists some of these differences and the expected effect on the VSL estimate for air 
pollution-related mortality. In the absence of a comprehensive and balanced set of adjustment 
factors, EPA believes it is reasonable to continue to use the $6.3 million value while 
acknowledging the significant limitations and uncertainties in the available literature.

The SAB-EEAC has reviewed many potential VSL adjustments and the state of the 
economics literature.  The SAB-EEAC advised EPA to ―continue to use a wage-risk-based VSL 
as its primary estimate, including appropriate sensitivity analyses to reflect the uncertainty of 
these estimates,‖ and that ―the only risk characteristic for which adjustments to the VSL can be 
made is the timing of the risk‖ (U.S. EPA, 2000a).  In developing our primary estimate of the 
benefits of premature mortality reductions, we have followed this advice and discounted over the 
lag period between exposure and premature mortality. 
Uncertainties Specific to Premature Mortality Valuation.  The economic benefits 
associated with reductions in the risk of premature mortality are the largest category of 
monetized benefits of the Toxics Rule.  In addition, in prior analyses, EPA has identified 
valuation of mortality-related benefits as the largest contributor to the range of uncertainty in 
monetized benefits (U.S. EPA, 1999b).
1
  Because of the uncertainty in estimates of the value of 
reducing premature mortality risk, it is important to adequately characterize and understand the 
various types of economic approaches available for valuing reductions in mortality risk.  Such an 
                                                 
1
 This conclusion was based on an assessment of uncertainty based on statistical error in epidemiological effect 
estimates and economic valuation estimates.  Additional sources of model error such as those examined in the PM 
mortality expert elicitation may result in different conclusions about the relative contribution of sources of 
uncertainty. 
 6-38 
assessment also requires an understanding of how alternative valuation approaches reflect that 
some individuals may be more susceptible to air pollution-induced mortality or reflect 
differences in the nature of the risk presented by air pollution relative to the risks studied in the 
relevant economics literature. 
The health science literature on air pollution indicates that several human characteristics 
affect the degree to which mortality risk affects an individual.  For example, some age groups 
appear to be more susceptible to air pollution than others (e.g., the elderly and children).  Health 
status prior to exposure also affects susceptibility.  An ideal benefits estimate of mortality risk 
reduction would reflect these human characteristics, in addition to an individual‘s WTP to 
improve one‘s own chances of survival plus WTP to improve other individuals‘ survival rates.  
The ideal measure would also take into account the specific nature of the risk reduction 
commodity that is provided to individuals, as well as the context in which risk is reduced.  To 
measure this value, it is important to assess how reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of 
dying from the time that reductions take effect onward and how individuals value these changes.  
Each individual‘s survival curve, or the probability of surviving beyond a given age, should shift 
as a result of an environmental quality improvement.  For example, changing the current 
probability of survival for an individual also shifts future probabilities of that individual‘s 
survival.  This probability shift will differ across individuals because survival curves depend on 
such characteristics as age, health state, and the current age to which the individual is likely to 
survive. 
Although a survival curve approach provides a theoretically preferred method for valuing 
the benefits of reduced risk of premature mortality associated with reducing air pollution, the 
approach requires a great deal of data to implement.  The economic valuation literature does not 
yet include good estimates of the value of this risk reduction commodity.  As a result, in this 
study we value reductions in premature mortality risk using the VSL approach. 
Other uncertainties specific to premature mortality valuation include the following: 
 Across-study variation:  There is considerable uncertainty as to whether the available 
literature on VSL provides adequate estimates of the VSL for risk reductions from air 
pollution reduction.  Although there is considerable variation in the analytical designs 
and data used in the existing literature, the majority of the studies involve the value of 
risks to a middle-aged working population.  Most of the studies examine differences 
in wages of risky occupations, using a hedonic wage approach.  Certain 
characteristics of both the population affected and the mortality risk facing that 
 6-39 
population are believed to affect the average WTP to reduce the risk.  The 
appropriateness of a distribution of WTP based on the current VSL literature for 
valuing the mortality-related benefits of reductions in air pollution concentrations 
therefore depends not only on the quality of the studies (i.e., how well they measure 
what they are trying to measure), but also on the extent to which the risks being 
valued are similar and the extent to which the subjects in the studies are similar to the 
population affected by changes in pollution concentrations. 
 Level of risk reduction:  The transferability of estimates of the VSL from the wage-
risk studies to the context of the PM NAAQS analysis rests on the assumption that, 
within a reasonable range, WTP for reductions in mortality risk is linear in risk 
reduction.  For example, suppose a study provides a result that the average WTP for a 
reduction in mortality risk of 1/100,000 is $50, but that the actual mortality risk 
reduction resulting from a given pollutant reduction is 1/10,000.  If WTP for 
reductions in mortality risk is linear in risk reduction, then a WTP of $50 for a 
reduction of 1/100,000 implies a WTP of $500 for a risk reduction of 1/10,000 (which 
is 10 times the risk reduction valued in the study).  Under the assumption of linearity, 
the estimate of the VSL does not depend on the particular amount of risk reduction 
being valued.  This assumption has been shown to be reasonable provided the change 
in the risk being valued is within the range of risks evaluated in the underlying studies 
(Rowlatt et al., 1998). 
 Voluntariness of risks evaluated:  Although job-related mortality risks may differ in 
several ways from air pollution-related mortality risks, the most important difference 
may be that job-related risks are incurred voluntarily, or generally assumed to be, 
whereas air pollution-related risks are incurred involuntarily.  Some evidence 
suggests that people will pay more to reduce involuntarily incurred risks than risks 
incurred voluntarily.  If this is the case, WTP estimates based on wage-risk studies 
may understate WTP to reduce involuntarily incurred air pollution-related mortality 
risks. 
 Sudden versus protracted death:  A final important difference related to the nature of 
the risk may be that some workplace mortality risks tend to involve sudden, 
catastrophic events, whereas air pollution-related risks tend to involve longer periods 
of disease and suffering prior to death.  Some evidence suggests that WTP to avoid a 
risk of a protracted death involving prolonged suffering and loss of dignity and 
personal control is greater than the WTP to avoid a risk (of identical magnitude) of 
 6-40 
sudden death.  To the extent that the mortality risks addressed in this assessment are 
associated with longer periods of illness or greater pain and suffering than are the 
risks addressed in the valuation literature, the WTP measurements employed in the 
present analysis would reflect a downward bias. 
 Self-selection and skill in avoiding risk:  Recent research (Shogren and Stamland, 
2002) suggests that VSL estimates based on hedonic wage studies may overstate the 
average value of a risk reduction.  This is based on the fact that the risk-wage trade-
off revealed in hedonic studies reflects the preferences of the marginal worker (i.e., 
that worker who demands the highest compensation for his risk reduction).  This 
worker must have either a higher workplace risk than the average worker, a lower risk 
tolerance than the average worker, or both.  However, the risk estimate used in 
hedonic studies is generally based on average risk, so the VSL may be upwardly 
biased because the wage differential and risk measures do not match. 
 Baseline risk and age:  Recent research (Smith, Pattanayak, and Van Houtven, 2006) 
finds that because individuals reevaluate their baseline risk of death as they age, the 
marginal value of risk reductions does not decline with age as predicted by some 
lifetime consumption models.  This research supports findings in recent stated 
preference studies that suggest only small reductions in the value of mortality risk 
reductions with increasing age. 
Chronic Bronchitis Valuation 
The best available estimate of WTP to avoid a case of CB comes from Viscusi, Magat, 
and Huber (1991).  The Viscusi, Magat, and Huber study, however, describes a severe case of 
CB to the survey respondents.  We therefore employ an estimate of WTP to avoid a pollution-
related case of CB, based on adjusting the Viscusi, Magat, and Huber (1991) estimate of the 
WTP to avoid a severe case.  This is done to account for the likelihood that an average case of 
pollution-related CB is not as severe.  The adjustment is made by applying the elasticity of WTP 
with respect to severity reported in the Krupnick and Cropper (1992) study.  Details of this 
adjustment procedure are provided in the Benefits Technical Support Document (TSD) for the 
Nonroad Diesel rulemaking (Abt Associates, 2003). 
We use the mean of a distribution of WTP estimates as the central tendency estimate of 
WTP to avoid a pollution-related case of CB in this analysis.  The distribution incorporates 
uncertainty from three sources:  the WTP to avoid a case of severe CB, as described by Viscusi, 
Magat, and Huber; the severity level of an average pollution-related case of CB (relative to that 
 6-41 
of the case described by Viscusi, Magat, and Huber); and the elasticity of WTP with respect to 
severity of the illness.  Based on assumptions about the distributions of each of these three 
uncertain components, we derive a distribution of WTP to avoid a pollution-related case of CB 
by statistical uncertainty analysis techniques.  The expected value (i.e., mean) of this distribution, 
which is about $340,000 (2006$), is taken as the central tendency estimate of WTP to avoid a 
PM-related case of CB. 
Nonfatal Myocardial Infarctions Valuation 
The Agency has recently incorporated into its analyses the impact of air pollution on the 
expected number of nonfatal heart attacks, although it has examined the impact of reductions in 
other related cardiovascular endpoints.  We were not able to identify a suitable WTP value for 
reductions in the risk of nonfatal heart attacks.  Instead, we use a COI unit value with two 
components:  the direct medical costs and the opportunity cost (lost earnings) associated with the 
illness event.  Because the costs associated with a myocardial infarction extend beyond the initial 
event itself, we consider costs incurred over several years.  Using age-specific annual lost 
earnings estimated by Cropper and Krupnick (1990) and a 3% discount rate, we estimated a 
present discounted value in lost earnings (in 2006$) over 5 years due to a myocardial infarction 
of $8,774 for someone between the ages of 25 and 44, $12,932 for someone between the ages of 
45 and 54, and $74,746 for someone between the ages of 55 and 65.  The corresponding age-
specific estimates of lost earnings (in 2006$) using a 7% discount rate are $7,855, $11,578, and 
$66,920, respectively.  Cropper and Krupnick (1990) do not provide lost earnings estimates for 
populations under 25 or over 65.  As such, we do not include lost earnings in the cost estimates 
for these age groups. 
We found three possible sources in the literature of estimates of the direct medical costs 
of myocardial infarction: 
 Wittels et al. (1990) estimated expected total medical costs of myocardial infarction 
over 5 years to be $51,211 (in 1986$) for people who were admitted to the hospital 
and survived hospitalization.  (There does not appear to be any discounting used.)  
Wittels et al. was used to value coronary heart disease in the 812 Retrospective 
Analysis of the Clean Air Act.  Using the CPI-U for medical care, the Wittels 
estimate is $144,111 in year 2006$.  This estimated cost is based on a medical cost 
model, which incorporated therapeutic options, projected outcomes, and prices (using 
―knowledgeable cardiologists‖ as consultants).  The model used medical data and 
medical decision algorithms to estimate the probabilities of certain events and/or 
 6-42 
medical procedures being used.  The authors note that the average length of 
hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction has decreased over time (from an 
average of 12.9 days in 1980 to an average of 11 days in 1983).  Wittels et al. used 10 
days as the average in their study.  It is unclear how much further the length of stay 
for myocardial infarction may have decreased from 1983 to the present.  The average 
length of stay for ICD code 410 (myocardial infarction) in the year-2000 Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) HCUP database is 5.5 days.  However, this 
may include patients who died in the hospital (not included among our nonfatal 
myocardial infarction cases), whose length of stay was therefore substantially shorter 
than it would be if they had not died. 
 Eisenstein et al. (2001) estimated 10-year costs of $44,663 in 1997$, or $64,003 in 
2006$ for myocardial infarction patients, using statistical prediction (regression) 
models to estimate inpatient costs.  Only inpatient costs (physician fees and hospital 
costs) were included. 
 Russell et al. (1998) estimated first-year direct medical costs of treating nonfatal 
myocardial infarction of $15,540 (in 1995$) and $1,051 annually thereafter.  
Converting to year 2006$, that would be $30,102 for a 5-year period (without 
discounting) or $38,113 for a 10-year period. 
In summary, the three different studies provided significantly different values (see 
Table 6-9).

As noted above, the estimates from these three studies are substantially different, and we 
have not adequately resolved the sources of differences in the estimates.  Because the wage-
related opportunity cost estimates from Cropper and Krupnick (1990) cover a 5-year period, we 
 6-43 
used estimates for medical costs that similarly cover a 5-year period (i.e., estimates from Wittels 
et al. (1990) and Russell et al. (1998).  We used a simple average of the two 5-year estimates, or

6.4.5 Hospital Admissions Valuation 
In the absence of estimates of societal WTP to avoid hospital visits/admissions for 
specific illnesses, estimates of total cost of illness (total medical costs plus the value of lost 
productivity) typically are used as conservative, or lower bound, estimates. These estimates are 
biased downward, because they do not include the willingness-to-pay value of avoiding pain and 
suffering. 
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9, 1979) code-specific COI estimates 
used in this analysis consist of estimated hospital charges and the estimated opportunity cost of 
time spent in the hospital (based on the average length of a hospital stay for the illness). We 
based all estimates of hospital charges and length of stays on statistics provided by the Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ 2000). We estimated the opportunity cost of a day 
spent in the hospital as the value of the lost daily wage, regardless of whether the hospitalized 
individual is in the workforce. To estimate the lost daily wage, we divided the 1990 median 
weekly wage by five and inflated the result to year 2006$ using the CPI-U ―all items.‖ The 
resulting estimate is $127.93. The total cost-of-illness estimate for an ICD code-specific hospital 
stay lasting n days, then, was the mean hospital charge plus $127.93 multiplied by n.

the WTP for a severe case of CB, and $

severity, based on the regression results

(1992). The distribution of WTP for an 
average severity-level case of CB was 
generated by Monte Carlo methods, 
drawing from each of three distributions: 
(1) WTP to avoid a severe case of CB is 
assigned a 1/9 probability of being each 
of the first nine deciles of the distribution 
of WTP responses in Viscusi et al. 
(1991); (2) the severity of a pollution-
related case of CB (relative to the case 
described in the Viscusi study) is 
assumed to have a triangular distribution, 
with the most likely value at severity 
level 6.5 and endpoints at 1.0 and 12.0; 
and (3) the constant in the elasticity of 
WTP with respect to severity is normally 
distributed with mean = 0.18 and 
standard deviation = 0.0669 (from

LRS is the average of the dollar values

that the actual value is likely to be closer

Asthma-Related Emergency Room Visits Valuation 
To value asthma emergency room visits, we used a simple average of two estimates from 
the health economics literature. The first estimate comes from Smith et al. (1997), who reported 
approximately 1.2 million asthma-related emergency room visits in 1987, at a total cost of 
$186.5 million (1987$). The average cost per visit that year was $155; in 2006$, that cost was 
 6-48 
$400.88 (using the CPI-U for medical care to adjust to 2006$). The second estimate comes from 
Stanford et al. (1999), who reported the cost of an average asthma-related emergency room visit 
at $335.14, based on 1996–1997 data. A simple average of the two estimates yields a (rounded) 
unit value of $368. 
Minor Restricted Activity Days Valuation 
No studies are reported to have estimated WTP to avoid a minor restricted activity day. 
However, one of EPA‘s contractors, IEc (1994) has derived an estimate of willingness to pay to 
avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day, using estimates from Tolley et al. (1986) of 
WTP for avoiding a combination of coughing, throat congestion and sinusitis. The IEc estimate 
of WTP to avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day is $38.37 (1990$), or about $62.04 
(2006$). 
Although Ostro and Rothschild (1989) statistically linked ozone and minor restricted 
activity days, it is likely that most MRADs associated with ozone exposure are, in fact, minor 
respiratory restricted activity days. For the purpose of valuing this health endpoint, we used the 
estimate of mean WTP to avoid a minor respiratory restricted activity day. 
Visibility Valuation 
Reductions in NO2 and SO2 emissions along with the secondary formation of PM2.5 
would improve the level of visibility throughout the United States because these suspended 
particles and gases degrade visibility by scattering and absorbing light (U.S. EPA, 2009d). 
Visibility has direct significance to people‘s enjoyment of daily activities and their overall sense 
of wellbeing (U.S. EPA, 2009d).  Individuals value visibility both in the places they live and 
work, in the places they travel to for recreational purposes, and at sites of unique public value, 
such as the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.  This section discusses the measurement of 
the economic benefits of improved visibility. 
Visual air quality (VAQ) is commonly measured as either light extinction, which is 
defined as the loss of light per unit of distance in terms of inverse megameters (Mm
-1
) or the 
deciview (dv) metric (Pitchford and Malm, 1993), which is a logarithmic function of extinction.  
Extinction and deciviews are physical measures of the amount of visibility impairment (e.g., the 
amount of ―haze‖), with both extinction and deciview increasing as the amount of haze increases.  
Pitchford and Malm characterize a change of one deciview as ―a small but perceptible scenic 
change under many circumstances.‖ Light extinction is the optical characteristic of the 
atmosphere that occurs when light is either scattered or absorbed, which converts the light to 
heat.  Particulate matter and gases can both scatter and absorb light.  Fine particles with 
 6-49 
significant light-extinction efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental 
carbon, and soil (Sisler, 1996).  The extent to which any amount of light extinction affects a 
person‘s ability to view a scene depends on both scene and light characteristics.  For example, 
the appearance of a nearby object (i.e. a building) is generally less sensitive to a change in light 
extinction than the appearance of a similar object at a greater distance.  See Figure 6-3 for an 
illustration of the important factors affecting visibility. 
Figure 6-3. Important Factors Involved in Seeing a Scenic Vista (Malm, 1999) 
 
In conjunction with the U.S. National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, other Federal 
land managers, and State organizations in the U.S., the U.S. EPA has supported visibility 
monitoring in national parks and wilderness areas since 1988.  The monitoring network known 
as IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments) now includes 150 
sites that represent almost all of the Class I areas across the country (see Figure 6-4) (U.S. EPA, 
2009d). 
 6-50 
Figure 6-4. Mandatory Class I Areas in the U.S. 
 
Annual average visibility conditions (reflecting light extinction due to both anthropogenic 
and non-anthropogenic sources) vary regionally across the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2009d).  The rural 
East generally has higher levels of impairment than remote sites in the West, with the exception 
of urban-influenced sites such as San Gorgonio Wilderness (CA) and Point Reyes National 
Seashore (CA), which have annual average levels comparable to certain sites in the Northeast 
(U.S. EPA, 2004).  Higher visibility impairment levels in the East are due to generally higher 
concentrations of fine particles, particularly sulfates, and higher average relative humidity levels.  
While visibility trends have improved in most Class I areas, the recent data show that these areas 
continue to suffer from visibility impairment.  In eastern parks, average visual range has 
decreased from 90 miles to 15-25 miles, and in the West, visual range has decreased from 140 
miles to 35-90 miles (U.S. EPA, 2004; U.S. EPA, 1999b). 
EPA distinguishes benefits from two categories of visibility changes:  residential 
visibility and recreational visibility.  In both cases economic benefits are believed to consist of 
use values and nonuse values.  Use values include the aesthetic benefits of better visibility, 
improved road and air safety, and enhanced recreation in activities like hunting and 
birdwatching.  Nonuse values are based on people‘s beliefs that the environment ought to exist 
 6-51 
free of human-induced haze.  Nonuse values may be more important for recreational areas, 
particularly national parks and monuments. 
Residential visibility benefits are those that occur from visibility changes in urban, 
suburban, and rural areas.  In previous assessments, EPA used a study on residential visibility 
valuation conducted in 1990 (McClelland et al., 1993).  Subsequently, EPA designated the 
McClelland et al. study as significantly less reliable for regulatory benefit-cost analysis 
consistent with SAB advice (U.S. EPA-SAB, 1999).  Although a wide range of published, peer-
review literature supports a non-zero value for residential visibility (Brookshire et al., 1982; Rae, 
1983; Tolley et al., 1986; Chestnut and Rowe, 1990c; McClleand et al., 1993; Loehman et al., 
1994), the residential visibility benefits have not been calculated in this analysis. 
For recreational visibility, only one existing study provides defensible monetary 
estimates of the value of visibility changes in a 1988 survey on recreational visibility value 
(Chestnut and Rowe, 1990a; 1990b).  Although there are a number of other studies in the 
literature, they were conducted in the early 1980s and did not use methods that are considered 
defensible by current standards.  The Chestnut and Rowe study uses the CV method.  There has 
been a great deal of controversy and significant development of both theoretical and empirical 
knowledge about how to conduct CV surveys in the past decade.  In EPA‘s judgment, the 
Chestnut and Rowe study contains many of the elements of a valid CV study and is sufficiently 
reliable to serve as the basis for monetary estimates of the benefits of visibility changes in 
recreational areas.
1
  This study serves as an essential input to our estimates of the benefits of 
recreational visibility improvements in the primary benefits estimates. 
For the purposes of this analysis, recreational visibility improvements are defined as 
those that occur specifically in federal Class I areas.
2
  A key distinction between recreational and 
residential benefits is that only those people living in residential areas are assumed to receive 
benefits from residential visibility, while all households in the United States are assumed to 
derive some benefit from improvements in Class I areas.  Values are assumed to be higher if the 
Class I area is located close to their home.

 The Chestnut and Rowe study measured the demand 
for visibility in Class I areas managed by the National Park Service (NPS) in three broad regions

 An SAB advisory letter indicates that ―many members of the Council believe that the Chestnut and Rowe study is 
the best available‖ (EPA-SAB-COUNCIL-ADV-00-002, 1999, p. 13).  However, the committee did not formally 
approve use of these estimates because of concerns about the peer-reviewed status of the study.  EPA believes the 
study has received adequate review and has been cited in numerous peer-reviewed publications (Chestnut and 
Dennis, 1997).

 The Clean Air Act designates 156 national parks and wilderness areas as Class I areas for visibility protection.

Diesel rulemaking (Abt Associates, 2003).

of the country:  California, the Southwest, and the Southeast.  Respondents in five states were 
asked about their WTP to protect national parks or NPS-managed wilderness areas within a 
particular region.  The survey used photographs reflecting different visibility levels in the 
specified recreational areas.  The visibility levels in these photographs were later converted to 
deciviews for the current analysis.  The survey data collected were used to estimate a WTP 
equation for improved visibility.  In addition to the visibility change variable, the estimating 
equation also included household income as an explanatory variable. 
The Chestnut and Rowe study did not measure values for visibility improvement in Class 
I areas outside the three regions.  Their study covered 86 of the 156 Class I areas in the United 
States.  We can infer the value of visibility changes in the other Class I areas by transferring 
values of visibility changes at Class I areas in the study regions.  A complete description of the 
benefits transfer method used to infer values for visibility changes in Class I areas outside the 
study regions is provided in the Benefits TSD for the Nonroad Diesel rulemaking (Abt 
Associates, 2003). 
The Chestnut and Rowe study (Chestnut and Rowe, 1990a; 1990b), although representing 
the best available estimates, has a number of limitations.  These include the following: 
 The age of the study (late 1980s) will increase the uncertainty about the 
correspondence of the estimated values to those that might be provided by current or 
future populations. 
 The survey focused only on populations in five states, so the application of the 
estimated values to populations outside those states requires that preferences of 
populations in the five surveyed states be similar to those of non-surveyed states. 
 There is an inherent difficulty in separating values expressed for visibility 
improvements from an overall value for improved air quality.  The Chestnut and 
Rowe study attempted to control for this by informing respondents that ―other 
households are being asked about visibility, human health, and vegetation protections 
in urban areas and at national parks in other regions.‖  However, most of the 
respondents did not feel that they were able to segregate visibility at national parks 
entirely from residential visibility and health effects. 
 It is not clear exactly what visibility improvements the respondents to the Chestnut 
and Rowe survey were valuing.  The WTP question asked about changes in average 
visibility, but the survey respondents were shown photographs of only summertime 
 6-53 
conditions, when visibility is generally at its worst.  It is possible that the respondents 
believed those visibility conditions held year-round, in which case they would have 
been valuing much larger overall improvements in visibility than what otherwise 
would be the case. For the purpose of the benefits analysis for this rule, EPA assumed 
that respondents provided values for changes in annual average visibility.  Because 
most policies will result in a shift in the distribution of visibility (usually affecting the 
worst days more than the best days), the annual average may not be the most relevant 
metric for policy analysis. 
 The survey did not include reminders of possible substitutes (e.g., visibility at other 
parks) or budget constraints.  These reminders are considered to be best practice for 
stated preference surveys. 
 The Chestnut and Rowe survey focused on visibility improvements in and around 
national parks and wilderness areas.  The survey also focused on visibility 
improvements of national parks in the southwest United States.  Given that national 
parks and wilderness areas exhibit unique characteristics, it is not clear whether the 
WTP estimate obtained from Chestnut and Rowe can be transferred to other national 
parks and wilderness areas, without introducing additional uncertainty. 
In general, the survey design and implementation reflect the period in which the survey 
was conducted.  Since that time, many improvements to the stated preference methodology have 
been developed.  As future survey efforts are completed, EPA will incorporate values for 
visibility improvements reflecting the improved survey designs. 
The estimated relationship from the Chestnut and Rowe study is only directly applicable 
to the populations represented by survey respondents.  EPA used benefits transfer methodology 
to extrapolate these results to the population affected by the reductions in precursor emissions 
associated with this rule.  A general WTP equation for improved visibility (measured in 
deciviews) was developed as a function of the baseline level of visibility, the magnitude of the 
visibility improvement, and household income.  The behavioral parameters of this equation were 
taken from analysis of the Chestnut and Rowe data.  These parameters were used to calibrate 
WTP for the visibility changes resulting from this rule.  The method for developing calibrated 
WTP functions is based on the approach developed by Smith et al. (2002).  Available evidence 
indicates that households are willing to pay more for a given visibility improvement as their 
income increases (Chestnut, 1997).  The benefits estimates here incorporate Chestnut‘s estimate 
that a 1% increase in income is associated with a 0.9% increase in WTP for a given change in 
 6-54 
visibility.  A more detailed explanation of the visibility benefits methodology is provided in 
Appendix I of the PM NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006). 
One major source of uncertainty for the visibility benefits estimate is the benefits transfer 
process used.  Judgments used to choose the functional form and key parameters of the 
estimating equation for WTP for the affected population could have significant effects on the 
size of the estimates.  Assumptions about how individuals respond to changes in visibility that 
are either very small or outside the range covered in the Chestnut and Rowe study could also 
affect the results. 
In addition, our estimate of visibility benefits is incomplete.  For example, we anticipate 
improvement in visibility in residential areas for which we are currently unable to monetize 
benefits, such as the Northeastern and Central regions of the U.S.  The value of visibility benefits 
in areas where we were unable to monetize benefits could also be substantial. EPA requests 
public comment on the approach taken here to quantify the monetary value of changes in 
visibility in Class I areas. 
Growth in WTP Reflecting National Income Growth Over Time 
Our analysis accounts for expected growth in real income over time.  Economic theory 
argues that WTP for most goods (such as environmental protection) will increase if real incomes 
increase.  There is substantial empirical evidence that the income elasticity
1
 of WTP for health 
risk reductions is positive, although there is uncertainty about its exact value.  Thus, as real 
income increases, the WTP for environmental improvements also increases.  Although many 
analyses assume that the income elasticity of WTP is unit elastic (i.e., a 10% higher real income 
level implies a 10% higher WTP to reduce risk changes), empirical evidence suggests that 
income elasticity is substantially less than one and thus relatively inelastic.  As real income rises, 
the WTP value also rises but at a slower rate than real income. 
The effects of real income changes on WTP estimates can influence benefits estimates in 
two different ways:  through real income growth between the year a WTP study was conducted 
and the year for which benefits are estimated, and through differences in income between study 
populations and the affected populations at a particular time.  Empirical evidence of the effect of 
real income on WTP gathered to date is based on studies examining the former.  The 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (EEAC) of the Science Advisory Board (SAB)

 Income elasticity is a common economic measure equal to the percentage change in WTP for a 1% change in 
income.

advised EPA to adjust WTP for increases in real income over time but not to adjust WTP to 
account for cross-sectional income differences ―because of the sensitivity of making such 
distinctions, and because of insufficient evidence available at present‖ (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2000a).  
A recent advisory by another committee associated with the SAB, the Advisory Council on 
Clean Air Compliance Analysis, has provided conflicting advice.  While agreeing with ―the 
general principle that the willingness to pay to reduce mortality risks is likely to increase with 
growth in real income (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a, p. 52)‖ and that  ―The same increase should be 
assumed for the WTP for serious nonfatal health effects (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a, p. 52),‖ they 
note that ―given the limitations and uncertainties in the available empirical evidence, the Council 
does not support the use of the proposed adjustments for aggregate income growth as part of the 
primary analysis (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004a, p. 53).‖  Until these conflicting advisories have been 
reconciled, EPA will continue to adjust valuation estimates to reflect income growth using the 
methods described below, while providing sensitivity analyses for alternative income growth 
adjustment factors. 
Based on a review of the available income elasticity literature, we adjusted the valuation 
of human health benefits upward to account for projected growth in real U.S. income.  Faced 
with a dearth of estimates of income elasticities derived from time-series studies, we applied 
estimates derived from cross-sectional studies in our analysis.  Details of the procedure can be 
found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999).  An abbreviated description of the procedure we used to 
account for WTP for real income growth between 1990 and 2016 is presented below. 
Reported income elasticities suggest that the severity of a health effect is a primary 
determinant of the strength of the relationship between changes in real income and WTP.  As 
such, we use different elasticity estimates to adjust the WTP for minor health effects, severe and 
chronic health effects, and premature mortality.  Note that because of the variety of empirical 
sources used in deriving the income elasticities, there may appear to be inconsistencies in the 
magnitudes of the income elasticities relative to the severity of the effects (a priori one might 
expect that more severe outcomes would show less income elasticity of WTP).  We have not 
imposed any additional restrictions on the empirical estimates of income elasticity. One 
explanation for the seeming inconsistency is the difference in timing of conditions.  WTP for 
minor illnesses is often expressed as a short term payment to avoid a single episode.  WTP for 
major illnesses and mortality risk reductions are based on longer term measures of payment 
(such as wages or annual income).  Economic theory suggests that relationships become more 
elastic as the length of time grows, reflecting the ability to adjust spending over a longer time 
period.  Based on this theory, it would be expected that WTP for reducing long term risks would 
 6-56 
be more elastic than WTP for reducing short term risks.  We also expect that the WTP for 
improved visibility in Class I areas would increase with growth in real income.  The relative 
magnitude of the income elasticity of WTP for visibility compared with those for health effects 
suggests that visibility is not as much of a necessity as health, thus, WTP is more elastic with 
respect to income.  The elasticity values used to adjust estimates of benefits in 2016 are 
presented in Table 6-12.

Derivation of estimates can be found in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) and Chestnut (1997).  COI estimates are 
assigned an adjustment factor of 1.0. 
In addition to elasticity estimates, projections of real gross domestic product (GDP) and 
populations from 1990 to 2020 are needed to adjust benefits to reflect real per capita income 
growth.  For consistency with the emissions and benefits modeling, we used national population 
estimates for the years 1990 to 1999 based on U.S. Census Bureau estimates (Hollman, Mulder, 
and Kallan, 2000).  These population estimates are based on application of a cohort-component 
model applied to 1990 U.S. Census data projections (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2000).  For the 
years between 2000 and 2016, we applied growth rates based on the U.S. Census Bureau 
projections to the U.S. Census estimate of national population in 2000.  We used projections of 
real GDP provided in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) for the years 1990 to 2010.

projections of real GDP (in chained 1996 dollars) provided by Standard and Poor‘s (2000) for

Using the method outlined in Kleckner and Neumann (1999) and the population and 
income data described above, we calculated WTP adjustment factors for each of the elasticity 
estimates listed in Table 6-13.  Benefits for each of the categories (minor health effects, severe 
and chronic health effects, premature mortality, and visibility) are adjusted by multiplying the 
unadjusted benefits by the appropriate adjustment factor.  Note that, for premature mortality, we

2007 to 2010 are based on average GDP growth rates between 1999 and 2007.

 In previous analyses, we used the Standard and Poor‘s projections of GDP directly.  This led to an apparent 
discontinuity in the adjustment factors between 2010 and 2011.  We refined the method by applying the relative 
growth rates for GDP derived from the Standard and Poor‘s projections to the 2010 projected GDP based on the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis projections.

applied the income adjustment factor to the present discounted value of the stream of avoided 
mortalities occurring over the lag period.  Also note that because of a lack of data on the 
dependence of COI and income, and a lack of data on projected growth in average wages, no 
adjustments are made to benefits based on the COI approach or to work loss days and worker 
productivity.  This assumption leads us to underpredict benefits in future years because it is 
likely that increases in real U.S. income would also result in increased COI (due, for example, to 
increases in wages paid to medical workers) and increased cost of work loss days and lost worker 
productivity (reflecting that if worker incomes are higher, the losses resulting from reduced 
worker production would also be higher).

6.5 Unquantified Health and Welfare Benefits 
This analysis is limited by the available data and resources.  As such, we are not able to 
quantify several welfare benefit categories, as shown in Table 6-2.  In this section, we provide a 
qualitative assessment of some of the primary welfare benefit categories from reducing NO2 and 
SO2 emissions: health and ecosystem benefits of reducing nitrogen and sulfur emissions and 
deposition and vegetation benefits from reducing ozone.1
 
 While we were unable to quantify how 
large these benefits might be as a result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule, 
previous EPA assessments show that these benefits could be substantial (U.S. EPA, 2008f; U.S. 
EPA, 2009c; U.S. EPA, 2007b; U.S. EPA, 1999b).  The omission of these endpoints from the 
monetized results should not imply that the impacts are small or unimportant. 
6.5.1 Ecosystem Services 
Ecosystem services can be generally defined as the benefits that individuals and 
organizations obtain from ecosystems.  EPA has defined ecological goods and services as the 
―outputs of ecological functions or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to social 
welfare or have the potential to do so in the future.  Some outputs may be bought and sold, but

 Some quantitative estimates of the total value of certain recreational and environmental goods given current and 
historic emission levels are provided below. They do not reflect benefits that would accrue as a result of this 
result. However, these values would be expected to increase as emissions are decreased a result of this rule.  
 6-58 
most are not marketed‖ (U.S. EPA, 2006b).  Figure 6-5 provides the Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment‘s schematic demonstrating the connections between the categories of ecosystem 
services and human well-being.  The interrelatedness of these categories means that any one 
ecosystem may provide multiple services.  Changes in these services can affect human well-
being by affecting security, health, social relationships, and access to basic material goods 
(MEA, 2005). 
In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005), ecosystem services are 
classified into four main categories: 
1. Provisioning: Products obtained from ecosystems, such as the production of food and water 
2. Regulating: Benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as the control 
of climate and disease 
3. Cultural: Nonmaterial benefits that people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual 
enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and aesthetic experiences 
4. Supporting: Services necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services, such as 
nutrient cycles and crop pollination 
Figure 6-5. Linkages between Categories of Ecosystem Services and Components of Human 
Well-Being from Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA, 2005) 
 
The monetization of ecosystem services generally involves estimating the value of 
ecological goods and services based on what people are willing to pay (WTP) to increase 
ecological services or by what people are willing to accept (WTA) in compensation for 
reductions in them (U.S. EPA, 2006b).  There are three primary approaches for estimating the 
monetary value of ecosystem services: market-based approaches, revealed preference methods, 
 6-59 
and stated preference methods (U.S. EPA, 2006b).  Because economic valuation of ecosystem 
services can be difficult, nonmonetary valuation using biophysical measurements and concepts 
also can be used.  An example of a nonmonetary valuation method is the use of relative-value 
indicators (e.g., a flow chart indicating uses of a water body, such as boatable, fishable, 
swimmable, etc.).  It is necessary to recognize that in the analysis of the environmental responses 
associated with any particular policy or environmental management action, only a subset of the 
ecosystem services likely to be affected are readily identified.  Of those ecosystem services that 
are identified, only a subset of the changes can be quantified.  Within those services whose 
changes can be quantified, only a few will likely be monetized, and many will remain 
nonmonetized.  The stepwise concept leading up to the valuation of ecosystems services is 
graphically depicted in Figure 6-6.

6.5.2 Ecosystem Benefits of Reduced Nitrogen and Sulfur Deposition 
Science of Deposition 
Nitrogen and sulfur emissions occur over large regions of North America.  Once these 
pollutants are lofted to the middle and upper troposphere, they typically have a much longer 
lifetime and, with the generally stronger winds at these altitudes, can be transported long 
distances from their source regions. The length scale of this transport is highly variable owing to 
differing chemical and meteorological conditions encountered along the transport path (U.S. 
EPA, 2008f).  Sulfur is primarily emitted as SO2, and nitrogen can be emitted as NO, NO2, or 
NH3.  Secondary particles are formed from NOx and SOX gaseous emissions and associated 
 6-60 
chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  Deposition can occur in either a wet (i.e., rain, snow, 
sleet, hail, clouds, or fog) or dry form (i.e., gases or particles).  Together these emissions are 
deposited onto terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across the U.S., contributing to the problems of 
acidification, nutrient enrichment, and methylmercury production as represented in Figure 6-7.  
Although there is some evidence that nitrogen deposition may have positive effects on 
agricultural and forest output through passive fertilization, it is likely that the overall value is 
very small relative to other health and welfare effects.

The lifetimes of particles vary with particle size.  Accumulation-mode particles such as 
sulfates are kept in suspension by normal air motions and have a lower deposition velocity than 
coarse-mode particles; they can be transported thousands of kilometers and remain in the 
atmosphere for a number of days.  They are removed from the atmosphere primarily by cloud 
processes.  Particulates affect acid deposition by serving as cloud condensation nuclei and 
contribute directly to the acidification of rain.  In addition, the gas-phase species that lead to the 
dry deposition of acidity are also precursors of particles.  Therefore, reductions in NO2 and SO2 
emissions will decrease both acid deposition and PM concentrations, but not necessarily in a 
linear fashion.  (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Sulfuric acid is also deposited on surfaces by dry deposition 
and can contribute to environmental effects (U.S. EPA, 2008f). 
Ecological Effects of Acidification 
Deposition of nitrogen and sulfur can cause acidification, which alters biogeochemistry 
and affects animal and plant life in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across the U.S.  Soil 
acidification is a natural process, but is often accelerated by acidifying deposition, which can 
decrease concentrations of exchangeable base cations in soils (U.S. EPA, 2008f). Major 
terrestrial effects include a decline in sensitive tree species, such as red spruce (Picea rubens) 
and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Biological effects of acidification in 
terrestrial ecosystems are generally linked to aluminum toxicity and decreased ability of plant 
roots to take up base cations (U.S. EPA, 2008f). Decreases in the acid neutralizing capacity and 
increases in inorganic aluminum concentration contribute to declines in zooplankton, macro 
invertebrates, and fish species richness in aquatic ecosystems (U.S. EPA, 2008f). 
Geology (particularly surficial geology) is the principal factor governing the sensitivity of 
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to acidification from nitrogen and sulfur deposition (U.S. EPA, 
2008f).  Geologic formations having low base cation supply generally underlie the watersheds of 
acid-sensitive lakes and streams.  Other factors contribute to the sensitivity of soils and surface 
waters to acidifying deposition, including topography, soil chemistry, land use, and hydrologic 
flow path (U.S. EPA, 2008f). 
Aquatic Ecosystems 
Aquatic effects of acidification have been well studied in the U.S. and elsewhere at 
various trophic levels.  These studies indicate that aquatic biota have been affected by 
acidification at virtually all levels of the food web in acid sensitive aquatic ecosystems.  Effects 
have been most clearly documented for fish, aquatic insects, other invertebrates, and algae.  
Biological effects are primarily attributable to a combination of low pH and high inorganic 
 6-62 
aluminum concentrations.  Such conditions occur more frequently during rainfall and snowmelt 
that cause high flows of water and less commonly during low-flow conditions, except where 
chronic acidity conditions are severe.  Biological effects of episodes include reduced fish 
condition factor1, changes in species composition and declines in aquatic species richness across 
multiple taxa, ecosystems and regions.  These conditions may also result in direct fish mortality 
(Van Sickle et al., 1996).  Biological effects in aquatic ecosystems can be divided into two major 
categories: effects on health, vigor, and reproductive success; and effects on biodiversity. 
Surface water with ANC values greater than 50 μeq/L generally provides moderate protection for 
most fish (i.e., brook trout, others) and other aquatic organisms (U.S. EPA, 2009c).  Table 6-14 
provides a summary of the biological effects experienced at various ANC levels.

<0 micro

Near complete loss of fish populations is expected.  Planktonic communities

number of individuals in plankton species that are present is greatly 
reduced. 
Severe

20–50 μeq/L 
Fish species richness is greatly reduced (i.e., more than half of expected

sublethal effects, including loss of health, reproduction capacity, and fitness.  
Diversity and distribution of zooplankton communities decline. 
Moderate 
Concern 
50–100 μeq/L 
Fish species richness begins to decline (i.e., sensitive species are lost from 
lakes).  Brook trout populations are sensitive and variable, with possible 
sublethal effects.  Diversity and distribution of zooplankton communities 
also begin to decline as species that are sensitive to acidifying deposition are 
affected. 
Low 
Concern 
>100 μeq/L 
Fish species richness may be unaffected.  Reproducing brook trout 
populations are expected where habitat is suitable.  Zooplankton 
communities are unaffected and exhibit expected diversity and distribution. 
 
A number of national and regional assessments have been conducted to estimate the 
distribution and extent of surface water acidity in the U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  As a result, 
several regions of the U.S. have been identified as containing a large number of lakes and

streams that are seriously impacted by acidification.  Figure 6-8 illustrates those areas of the U.S. 
where aquatic ecosystems are at risk from acidification. 
Figure 6-8. Areas Potentially Sensitive to Aquatic Acidification (U.S. EPA, 2008f) 
 
Because acidification primarily affects the diversity and abundance of aquatic biota, it 
also affects the ecosystem services that are derived from the fish and other aquatic life found in 
these surface waters. 
While acidification is unlikely to have serious negative effects on, for example, water 
supplies, it can limit the productivity of surface waters as a source of food (i.e., fish).  In the 
northeastern United States, the surface waters affected by acidification are not a major source of 
commercially raised or caught fish; however, they are a source of food for some recreational and 
subsistence fishermen and for other consumers.  For example, there is evidence that certain 
population subgroups in the northeastern United States, such as the Hmong and Chippewa ethnic 
groups, have particularly high rates of self-caught fish consumption (Hutchison and Kraft, 1994; 
Peterson et al., 1994).  However, it is not known if and how their consumption patterns are 
affected by the reductions in available fish populations caused by surface water acidification. 
Inland surface waters support several cultural services, including aesthetic and 
educational services and recreational fishing.  Recreational fishing in lakes and streams is among 
 6-64 
the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the northeastern United States.  Based on 
studies conducted in the northeastern United States, Kaval and Loomis (2003) estimated average 
consumer surplus values per day of $36 for recreational fishing (in 2007 dollars); therefore, the 
implied total annual value of freshwater fishing in the northeastern United States was $5.1 billion 
in 2006.1
 
 For recreation days, consumer surplus value is most commonly measured using 
recreation demand, travel cost models. 
Another estimate of the overarching ecological benefits associated with reducing lake 
acidification levels in Adirondacks National Park can be derived from the contingent valuation 
(CV) survey (Banzhaf et al., 2006), which elicited values for specific improvements in 
acidification-related water quality and ecological conditions in Adirondack lakes.  The survey 
described a base version with minor improvements said to result from the program, and a scope 
version with large improvements due to the program and a gradually worsening status quo.  After 
adapting and transferring the results of this study and converting the 10-year annual payments to 
permanent annual payments using discount rates of 3% and 5%, the WTP estimates ranged from 
$48 to $107 per year per household (in 2004 dollars) for the base version and $54 to $154 for the 
scope version.  Using these estimates, the aggregate annual benefits of eliminating all 
anthropogenic sources of NOx and SOx emissions were estimated to range from $291 million to 
$829 million (U.S. EPA, 2009c).
2
 
In addition, inland surface waters provide a number of regulating services associated with 
hydrological and climate regulation by providing environments that sustain aquatic food webs.  
These services are disrupted by the toxic effects of acidification on fish and other aquatic life.  
Although it is difficult to quantify these services and how they are affected by acidification, 
some of these services may be captured through measures of provisioning and cultural services. 
Terrestrial Ecosystems 
Acidifying deposition has altered major biogeochemical processes in the U.S. by 
increasing the nitrogen and sulfur content of soils, accelerating nitrate and sulfate leaching from 
soil to drainage waters, depleting base cations (especially calcium and magnesium) from soils, 
and increasing the mobility of aluminum.  Inorganic aluminum is toxic to some tree roots.  Plants 
affected by high levels of aluminum from the soil often have reduced root growth, which restricts 
the ability of the plant to take up water and nutrients, especially calcium (U. S. EPA, 2008f).

These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a result 
of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

These direct effects can, in turn, influence the response of these plants to climatic stresses such 
as droughts and cold temperatures.  They can also influence the sensitivity of plants to other 
stresses, including insect pests and disease (Joslin et al., 1992) leading to increased mortality of 
canopy trees.  In the U.S., terrestrial effects of acidification are best described for forested 
ecosystems (especially red spruce and sugar maple ecosystems) with additional information on 
other plant communities, including shrubs and lichen (U.S. EPA, 2008f). 
Certain ecosystems in the continental U.S. are potentially sensitive to terrestrial 
acidification, which is the greatest concern regarding nitrogen and sulfur deposition U.S. EPA 
(2008f).  Figure 6-9 depicts the areas across the U.S. that are potentially sensitive to terrestrial 
acidification. 
Figure 6-9. Areas Potentially Sensitive to Terrestrial Acidification (U.S. EPA, 2008f) 
 
Both coniferous and deciduous forests throughout the eastern U.S. are experiencing 
gradual losses of base cation nutrients from the soil due to accelerated leaching from acidifying 
deposition.  This change in nutrient availability may reduce the quality of forest nutrition over 
the long term.  Evidence suggests that red spruce and sugar maple in some areas in the eastern 
U.S. have experienced declining health because of this deposition.  For red spruce, (Picea 
rubens) dieback or decline has been observed across high elevation landscapes of the 
northeastern U.S., and to a lesser extent, the southeastern U.S., and acidifying deposition has 
been implicated as a causal factor (DeHayes et al., 1999).  Figure 6-10 shows the distribution of 
red spruce (brown) and sugar maple (green) in the eastern U.S. 
 6-66 
Figure 6-10. Distribution of Red Spruce (pink) and Sugar Maple (green) in the Eastern 
U.S. (U.S. EPA, 2008f) 
 
Terrestrial acidification affects several important ecological endpoints, including declines 
in habitat for threatened and endangered species (cultural), declines in forest aesthetics (cultural), 
declines in forest productivity (provisioning), and increases in forest soil erosion and reductions 
in water retention (cultural and regulating). 
Forests in the northeastern United States provide several important and valuable 
provisioning services in the form of tree products.  Sugar maples are a particularly important 
commercial hardwood tree species, providing timber and maple syrup.  In the United States, 
sugar maple saw timber was nearly 900 million board feet in 2006 (USFS, 2006), and annual 
production of maple syrup was nearly 1.4 million gallons, accounting for approximately 19% of 
worldwide production.  The total annual value of U.S. production in these years was 
approximately $160 million (NASS, 2008).  Red spruce is also used in a variety of products 
including lumber, pulpwood, poles, plywood, and musical instruments.  The total removal of red 
spruce saw timber from timberland in the United States was over 300 million board feet in 2006 
(USFS, 2006). 
Forests in the northeastern United States are also an important source of cultural 
ecosystem services—nonuse (i.e., existence value for threatened and endangered species), 
recreational, and aesthetic services.  Red spruce forests are home to two federally listed species 
and one delisted species: 
 6-67 
1. Spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga)—endangered 
2. Rock gnome lichen (Gymnoderma lineare)—endangered 
3. Virginia northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus)—delisted, but 
important 
Forestlands support a wide variety of outdoor recreational activities, including fishing, 
hiking, camping, off-road driving, hunting, and wildlife viewing.  Regional statistics on 
recreational activities that are specifically forest based are not available; however, more general 
data on outdoor recreation provide some insights into the overall level of recreational services 
provided by forests.  More than 30% of the U.S. adult population visited a wilderness or 
primitive area during the previous year and engaged in day hiking (Cordell et al., 2008).  From 
1999 to 2004, 16% of adults in the northeastern United States
 
participated in off-road vehicle 
recreation, for an average of 27 days per year (Cordell et al., 2005).  The average consumer 
surplus value per day of off-road driving in the United States was $25 (in 2007 dollars), and the 
implied total annual value of off-road driving recreation in the northeastern United States was 
more than $9 billion (Kaval and Loomis, 2003).  More than 5% of adults in the northeastern 
United States participated in nearly 84 million hunting days (U.S. FWS and U.S. Census Bureau, 
2007).  Ten percent of adults in northeastern states participated in wildlife viewing away from 
home on 122 million days in 2006.  For these recreational activities in the northeastern United 
States, Kaval and Loomis (2003) estimated average consumer surplus values per day of $52 for 
hunting and $34 for wildlife viewing (in 2007 dollars).  The implied total annual value of 
hunting and wildlife viewing in the northeastern United States was, therefore, $4.4 billion and 
$4.2 billion, respectively, in 2006. 
As previously mentioned, it is difficult to estimate the portion of these recreational 
services that are specifically attributable to forests and to the health of specific tree species.  
However, one recreational activity that is directly dependent on forest conditions is fall color 
viewing.  Sugar maple trees, in particular, are known for their bright colors and are, therefore, an 
essential aesthetic component of most fall color landscapes.  A survey of residents in the Great 
Lakes area found that roughly 30% of residents reported at least one trip in the previous year 
involving fall color viewing (Spencer and Holecek, 2007).  In a separate study conducted in 
Vermont, Brown (2002) reported that more than 22% of households visiting Vermont in 2001 
made the trip primarily for viewing fall colors. 
Two studies estimated values for protecting high-elevation spruce forests in the southern 
Appalachian Mountains.  Kramer et al. (2003) conducted a contingent valuation study estimating 
households‘ WTP for programs to protect remaining high-elevation spruce forests from damages 
associated with air pollution and insect infestation.  Median household WTP was estimated to be 
 6-68 
roughly $29 (in 2007 dollars) for a smaller program, and $44 for the more extensive program.  
Jenkins et al. (2002) conducted a very similar study in seven Southern Appalachian states on a 
potential program to maintain forest conditions at status quo levels.  The overall mean annual 
WTP for the forest protection programs was $208 (in 2007 dollars).  Multiplying the average 
WTP estimate from these studies by the total number of households in the seven-state 
Appalachian region results in an aggregate annual range of $470 million to $3.4 billion for 
avoiding a significant decline in the health of high-elevation spruce forests in the Southern 
Appalachian region.1 
Forests in the northeastern United States also support and provide a wide variety of 
valuable regulating services, including soil stabilization and erosion control, water regulation, 
and climate regulation.  The total value of these ecosystem services is very difficult to quantify 
in a meaningful way, as is the reduction in the value of these services associated with total 
nitrogen and sulfur deposition.  As terrestrial acidification contributes to root damages, reduced 
biomass growth, and tree mortality, all of these services are likely to be affected; however, the 
magnitude of these impacts is currently very uncertain. 
6.5.3 Ecological Effects Associated with Gaseous Sulfur Dioxide 
Uptake of gaseous sulfur dioxide in a plant canopy is a complex process involving 
adsorption to surfaces (leaves, stems, and soil) and absorption into leaves.  SO2 penetrates into 
leaves through to the stomata, although there is evidence for limited pathways via the cuticle.  
Pollutants must be transported from the bulk air to the leaf boundary layer in order to get to the 
stomata.  When the stomata are closed, as occurs under dark or drought conditions, resistance to 
gas uptake is very high and the plant has a very low degree of susceptibility to injury.  In 
contrast, mosses and lichens do not have a protective cuticle barrier to gaseous pollutants or 
stomates and are generally more sensitive to gaseous sulfur and nitrogen than vascular plants 
(U.S. EPA, 2008f).  Acute foliar injury usually happens within hours of exposure, involves a 
rapid absorption of a toxic dose, and involves collapse or necrosis of plant tissues.  Another type 
of visible injury is termed chronic injury and is usually a result of variable SO2 exposures over 
the growing season.  Besides foliar injury, chronic exposure to low SO2 concentrations can result 
in reduced photosynthesis, growth, and yield of plants (U.S. EPA, 2008f).  These effects are 
cumulative over the season and are often not associated with visible foliar injury.  As with foliar 
injury, these effects vary among species and growing environment.  SO2 is also considered the

primary factor causing the death of lichens in many urban and industrial areas (Hutchinson et al., 
1996). 
In addition to the role of sulfate deposition on methylation, the technologies installed to 
reduce emissions of NOx and SO2 associated with this proposed rule would also reduce mercury 
emissions. EPA recently commissioned an information collection request that will soon provide 
greatly improved power industry mercury emissions estimates that will enable the Agency to 
better estimate mercury emissions changes from its air emissions control actions. For this reason, 
the Agency did not estimate Hg changes in this rule and will instead wait for these new data 
which will be available in the near future. Due to time and resource limitations, we were unable 
in any event to model mercury dispersion, deposition, methylation, bioaccumulation in fish 
tissue, and human consumption of mercury-contaminated fish that would be needed in order to 
estimate the human health benefits from reducing these mercury emissions. 
6.5.4 Nitrogen Enrichment 
Aquatic Enrichment 
One of the main adverse ecological effects resulting from N deposition, particularly in the 
Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, is the effect associated with nutrient enrichment in 
estuarine waters.  A recent assessment of 141 estuaries nationwide by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that 19 estuaries (13%) suffered from 
moderately high or high levels of eutrophication due to excessive inputs of both N and 
phosphorus, and a majority of these estuaries are located in the coastal area from North Carolina 
to Massachusetts (NOAA, 2007).  For estuaries in the Mid-Atlantic region, the contribution of 
atmospheric distribution to total N loads is estimated to range between 10% and 58% (Valigura 
et al., 2001). 
Eutrophication in estuaries is associated with a range of adverse ecological effects.  The 
conceptual framework developed by NOAA emphasizes four main types of eutrophication 
effects—low dissolved oxygen (DO), harmful algal blooms (HABs), loss of submerged aquatic 
vegetation (SAV), and low water clarity.  Low DO disrupts aquatic habitats, causing stress to 
fish and shellfish, which, in the short-term, can lead to episodic fish kills and, in the long-term, 
can damage overall growth in fish and shellfish populations.  Low DO also degrades the 
aesthetic qualities of surface water.  In addition to often being toxic to fish and shellfish, and 
leading to fish kills and aesthetic impairments of estuaries, HABs can, in some instances, also be 
harmful to human health.  SAV provides critical habitat for many aquatic species in estuaries 
and, in some instances, can also protect shorelines by reducing wave strength; therefore, declines 
 6-70 
in SAV due to nutrient enrichment are an important source of concern.  Low water clarity is the 
result of accumulations of both algae and sediments in estuarine waters.  In addition to 
contributing to declines in SAV, high levels of turbidity also degrade the aesthetic qualities of 
the estuarine environment. 
Estuaries in the eastern United States are an important source of food production, in 
particular fish and shellfish production.  The estuaries are capable of supporting large stocks of 
resident commercial species, and they serve as the breeding grounds and interim habitat for 
several migratory species.  To provide an indication of the magnitude of provisioning services 
associated with coastal fisheries, from 2005 to 2007, the average value of total catch was $1.5 
billion per year.  It is not known, however, what percentage of this value is directly attributable 
to or dependent upon the estuaries in these states. 
In addition to affecting provisioning services through commercial fish harvests, 
eutrophication in estuaries may also affect the demand for seafood.  For example, a well-
publicized toxic pfiesteria bloom in the Maryland Eastern Shore in 1997, which involved 
thousands of dead and lesioned fish, led to an estimated $56 million (in 2007 dollars) in lost 
seafood sales for 360 seafood firms in Maryland in the months following the outbreak (Lipton, 
1999). 
Estuaries in the United States also provide an important and substantial variety of cultural 
ecosystem services, including water-based recreational and aesthetic services.  The water quality 
in the estuary directly affects the quality of these experiences. For example, there were 26 
million days of saltwater fishing coastal states from North Carolina to Massachusetts in 2006 
(FWA and Census, 2007).  Assuming an average consumer surplus value for a fishing day at $36 
(in 2007 dollars) in the Northeast and $87 in the Southeast (Kaval and Loomis, 2003), the 
aggregate value was approximately $1.3 billion (in 2007 dollars). 1 In addition, almost 6 million 
adults participated in motorboating in coastal states from North Carolina to Massachusetts, for a 
total of nearly 63 million days annually during 1999–2000 (Leeworthy and Wiley, 2001).  Using 
a national daily value estimate of $32 (in 2007 dollars) for motorboating (Kaval and Loomis 
(2003), the aggregate value of these coastal motorboating outings was $2 billion per year. 2  
Almost 7 million participated in birdwatching for 175 million days per year, and more than 3 
million participated in visits to non-beach coastal waterside areas.

of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.

 6-71 
Estuaries and marshes have the potential to support a wide range of regulating services, 
including climate, biological, and water regulation; pollution detoxification; erosion prevention; 
and protection against natural hazards from declines in SAV (MEA, 2005).  SAV can help 
reduce wave energy levels and thus protect shorelines against excessive erosion, which increases 
the risks of episodic flooding and associated damages to near-shore properties or public 
infrastructure or even contribute to shoreline retreat. 
Terrestrial Enrichment 
Terrestrial enrichment occurs when terrestrial ecosystems receive N loadings in excess of 
natural background levels, either through atmospheric deposition or direct application.  Evidence 
presented in the Integrated Science Assessment (U.S. EPA, 2008f) supports a causal relationship 
between atmospheric N deposition and biogeochemical cycling and fluxes of N and carbon in 
terrestrial systems.  Furthermore, evidence summarized in the report supports a causal link 
between atmospheric N deposition and changes in the types and number of species and 
biodiversity in terrestrial systems.  Nitrogen enrichment occurs over a long time period; as a 
result, it may take as much as 50 years or more to see changes in ecosystem conditions and 
indicators.  This long time scale also affects the timing of the ecosystem service changes. 
One of the main provisioning services potentially affected by N deposition is grazing 
opportunities offered by grasslands for livestock production in the Central U.S.  Although N 
deposition on these grasslands can offer supplementary nutritive value and promote overall grass 
production, there are concerns that fertilization may favor invasive grasses and shift the species 
composition away from native grasses. This process may ultimately reduce the productivity of 
grasslands for livestock production.  Losses due to invasive grasses can be significant; for 
example, based on a bioeconomic model of cattle grazing in the upper Great Plains, Leitch, 
Leistritz, and Bangsund (1996) and Leistritz, Bangsund, and Hodur (2004) estimated $130 
million in losses due to a leafy spurge infestation in the Dakotas, Montana, and Wyoming. 1 
However, the contribution of N deposition to these losses is still uncertain. 
6.5.5 Benefits of Reducing Ozone Effects on Vegetation and Ecosystems 
Ozone causes discernible injury to a wide array of vegetation (U.S. EPA, 2006a; Fox and 
Mickler, 1996).  In terms of forest productivity and ecosystem diversity, ozone may be the 
pollutant with the greatest potential for regional-scale forest impacts (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  Studies

These estimates reflect the total value of the service, not the marginal change in the value of the service as a result 
of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.   
 6-72 
have demonstrated repeatedly that ozone concentrations commonly observed in polluted areas 
can have substantial impacts on plant function (De Steiguer et al., 1990; Pye, 1988).
 
When ozone is present in the air, it can enter the leaves of plants, where it can cause 
significant cellular damage.  Like carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gaseous substances, ozone 
enters plant tissues primarily through the stomata in leaves in a process called ―uptake‖ (Winner 
and Atkinson, 1986).  Once sufficient levels of ozone (a highly reactive substance), or its 
reaction products, reaches the interior of plant cells, it can inhibit or damage essential cellular 
components and functions, including enzyme activities, lipids, and cellular membranes, 
disrupting the plant‘s osmotic (i.e., water) balance and energy utilization patterns (U.S. EPA, 
2006a; Tingey and Taylor, 1982).  With fewer resources available, the plant reallocates existing 
resources away from root growth and storage, above ground growth or yield, and reproductive 
processes, toward leaf repair and maintenance, leading to reduced growth and/or reproduction.  
Studies have shown that plants stressed in these ways may exhibit a general loss of vigor, which 
can lead to secondary impacts that modify plants‘ responses to other environmental factors.  
Specifically, plants may become more sensitive to other air pollutants, or more susceptible to 
disease, pest infestation, harsh weather (e.g., drought, frost) and other environmental stresses, 
which can all produce a loss in plant vigor in ozone-sensitive species that over time may lead to 
premature plant death.  Furthermore, there is evidence that ozone can interfere with the 
formation of mycorrhiza, essential symbiotic fungi associated with the roots of most terrestrial 
plants, by reducing the amount of carbon available for transfer from the host to the symbiont 
(U.S. EPA, 2006a). 
This ozone damage may or may not be accompanied by visible injury on leaves, and 
likewise, visible foliar injury may or may not be a symptom of the other types of plant damage 
described above.  Foliar injury is usually the first visible sign of injury to plants from ozone 
exposure and indicates impaired physiological processes in the leaves (Grulke, 2003).  When 
visible injury is present, it is commonly manifested as chlorotic or necrotic spots, and/or 
increased leaf senescence (accelerated leaf aging).  Because ozone damage can consist of visible 
injury to leaves, it can also reduce the aesthetic value of ornamental vegetation and trees in urban 
landscapes, and negatively affects scenic vistas in protected natural areas. 
Ozone can produce both acute and chronic injury in sensitive species depending on the 
concentration level and the duration of the exposure.  Ozone effects also tend to accumulate over 
the growing season of the plant, so that even lower concentrations experienced for a longer 
duration have the potential to create chronic stress on sensitive vegetation.  Not all plants, 
however, are equally sensitive to ozone.  Much of the variation in sensitivity between individual 
 6-73 
plants or whole species is related to the plant‘s ability to regulate the extent of gas exchange via 
leaf stomata (e.g., avoidance of ozone uptake through closure of stomata) (U.S. EPA, 2006a; 
Winner, 1994).  After injuries have occurred, plants may be capable of repairing the damage to a 
limited extent (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  Because of the differing sensitivities among plants to ozone, 
ozone pollution can also exert a selective pressure that leads to changes in plant community 
composition.  Given the range of plant sensitivities and the fact that numerous other 
environmental factors modify plant uptake and response to ozone, it is not possible to identify 
threshold values above which ozone is consistently toxic for all plants. 
Because plants are at the base of the food web in many ecosystems, changes to the plant 
community can affect associated organisms and ecosystems (including the suitability of habitats 
that support threatened or endangered species and below ground organisms living in the root 
zone).  Ozone impacts at the community and ecosystem level vary widely depending upon 
numerous factors, including concentration and temporal variation of tropospheric ozone, species 
composition, soil properties and climatic factors (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  In most instances, 
responses to chronic or recurrent exposure in forested ecosystems are subtle and not observable 
for many years.  These injuries can cause stand-level forest decline in sensitive ecosystems (U.S. 
EPA, 2006a, McBride et al., 1985; Miller et al., 1982).  It is not yet possible to predict ecosystem 
responses to ozone with much certainty; however, considerable knowledge of potential 
ecosystem responses has been acquired through long-term observations in highly damaged 
forests in the United States (U.S. EPA, 2006a). 
Ozone Effects on Forests 
Air pollution can affect the environment and affect ecological systems, leading to 
changes in the ecological community and influencing the diversity, health, and vigor of 
individual species (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  Ozone has been shown in numerous studies to have a 
strong effect on the health of many plants, including a variety of commercial and ecologically 
important forest tree species throughout the United States (U.S. EPA, 2007b). 
In the U.S., this data comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest 
Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program.  As part of its Phase 3 program, formerly 
known as Forest Health Monitoring, FIA examines ozone injury to ozone-sensitive plant species 
at ground monitoring sites in forestland across the country (excluding woodlots and urban trees).  
FIA looks for damage on the foliage of ozone-sensitive forest plant species at each site that 
meets certain minimum criteria.  Because ozone injury is cumulative over the course of the 
 6-74 
growing season, examinations are conducted in July and August, when ozone injury is typically 
highest. 
Monitoring of ozone injury to plants by the USDA Forest Service has expanded over the 
last 10 years from monitoring sites in 10 states in 1994 to nearly 1,000 monitoring sites in 41 
states in 2002.  The data underlying the indictor in Figure 6-11 are based on averages of all 
observations collected in 2002, the latest year for which data are publicly available at the time 
the study was conducted, and are broken down by U.S. EPA Regions.  Ozone damage to forest 
plants is classified using a subjective five-category biosite index based on expert opinion, but 
designed to be equivalent from site to site.  Ranges of biosite values translate to no injury, low or 
moderate foliar injury (visible foliar injury to highly sensitive or moderately sensitive plants, 
respectively), and high or severe foliar injury, which would be expected to result in tree-level or 
ecosystem-level responses, respectively (U.S. EPA, 2006a; Coulston, 2004).  The highest 
percentages of observed high and severe foliar injury, which are most likely to be associated with 
tree or ecosystem-level responses, are primarily found in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. 
Assessing the impact of ground-level ozone on forests in the eastern United States 
involves understanding the risks to sensitive tree species from ambient ozone concentrations and 
accounting for the prevalence of those species within the forest.  As a way to quantify the risks to 
particular plants from ground-level ozone, scientists have developed ozone-exposure/tree-
response functions by exposing tree seedlings to different ozone levels and measuring reductions 
in growth as ―biomass loss.‖  Typically, seedlings are used because they are easy to manipulate 
and measure their growth loss from ozone pollution.  The mechanisms of susceptibility to ozone 
within the leaves of seedlings and mature trees are identical, and the decreases predicted using 
the seedlings should be related to the decrease in overall plant fitness for mature trees, but the 
magnitude of the effect may be higher or lower depending on the tree species (Chappelka and 
Samuelson, 1998).  In areas where certain ozone-sensitive species dominate the forest community, the 
biomass loss from ozone can be significant.  Significant biomass loss can be defined as a more than 
2% annual biomass loss, which would cause long term ecological harm as the short-term 
negative effects on seedlings compound to affect long-term forest health (Heck, 1997).

Some of the common tree species in the United States that are sensitive to ozone are 
black cherry (Prunus serotina), tulip-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), and eastern white pine 
(Pinus strobus).  Ozone-exposure/tree-response functions have been developed for each of these 
tree species, as well as for aspen (Populus tremuliodes), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) 
(U.S. EPA, 2007b).  Other common tree species, such as oak (Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya 
spp.), are not as sensitive to ozone.  Consequently, with knowledge of the distribution of 
sensitive species and the level of ozone at particular locations, it is possible to estimate a 
―biomass loss‖ for each species across their range.  As shown in Figure 6-12, current ambient 
levels of ozone are associated with significant biomass loss across large geographic areas (U.S. 
EPA, 2009b).  However, this information is unavailable this rule.

Virginia Pine, Red Maple, and Quaking Aspen Biomass Loss due to Current Ozone 
Exposure, 2006-2008 (U.S. EPA, 2009b) 
 
To estimate the biomass loss for forest ecosystems across the eastern United States, the 
biomass loss for each of the seven tree species was calculated using the three-month, 12-hour 
W126 exposure metric at each location, along with each tree‘s individual C-R functions.  The 
W126 exposure metric was calculated using monitored ozone data from CASTNET and AQS 
sites, and a three-year average was used to mitigate the effect of variations in meteorological and 
soil moisture conditions.  The biomass loss estimate for each species was then multiplied by its 
prevalence in the forest community using the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest 
Service IV index of tree abundance calculated from Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) 
measurements (Prasad, 2003).  Sources of uncertainty include the ozone-exposure/plant-response 
functions, the tree abundance index, and other factors (e.g., soil moisture).  Although these 
factors were not considered, they can affect ozone damage (Chappelka, 1998). 
Ozone damage to the plants including the trees and understory in a forest can affect the 
ability of the forest to sustain suitable habitat for associated species particularly threatened and 
endangered species that have existence value – a nonuse ecosystem service - for the public.  
Similarly, damage to trees and the loss of biomass can affect the forest‘s provisioning services in 
the form of timber for various commercial uses.  In addition, ozone can cause discoloration of 
 6-77 
leaves and more rapid senescence (early shedding of leaves), which could negatively affect fall-
color tourism because the fall foliage would be less available or less attractive.  Beyond the 
aesthetic damage to fall color vistas, forests provide the public with many other recreational and 
educational services that may be impacted by reduced forest health including hiking, wildlife 
viewing (including bird watching), camping, picnicking, and hunting.  Another potential effect of 
biomass loss in forests is the subsequent loss of climate regulation service in the form of reduced 
ability to sequester carbon (Felzer et al., 2005). 
Ozone Effects on Crops and Urban Ornamentals 
Laboratory and field experiments have also shown reductions in yields for agronomic 
crops exposed to ozone, including vegetables (e.g., lettuce) and field crops (e.g., cotton and 
wheat).  Damage to crops from ozone exposures includes yield losses (i.e., in terms of weight, 
number, or size of the plant part that is harvested), as well as changes in crop quality (i.e., 
physical appearance, chemical composition, or the ability to withstand storage) (U.S. EPA, 
2007b).  The most extensive field experiments, conducted under the National Crop Loss 
Assessment Network (NCLAN) examined 15 species and numerous cultivars.  The NCLAN 
results show that ―several economically important crop species are sensitive to ozone levels 
typical of those found in the United States‖ (U.S. EPA, 2006a).  In addition, economic studies 
have shown reduced economic benefits as a result of predicted reductions in crop yields, directly 
affecting the amount and quality of the provisioning service provided by the crops in question, 
associated with observed ozone levels (Kopp et al., 1985; Adams et al., 1986; Adams et al., 
1989).  According to the Ozone Staff Paper, there has been no evidence that crops are becoming 
more tolerant of ozone (U.S. EPA, 2007b).  Using the Agriculture Simulation Model (AGSIM) 
(Taylor, 1994) to calculate the agricultural benefits of reductions in ozone exposure, U.S. EPA 
estimated that meeting a W126 standard of 21 ppm-hr would produce monetized benefits of 
approximately $160 million to $300 million (inflated to 2006 dollars) (U.S. EPA, 2007b). 1 
Urban ornamentals are an additional vegetation category likely to experience some 
degree of negative effects associated with exposure to ambient ozone levels.  Because ozone 
causes visible foliar injury, the aesthetic value of ornamentals (such as petunia, geranium, and 
poinsettia) in urban landscapes would be reduced (U.S. EPA, 2007b).  Sensitive ornamental 
species would require more frequent replacement and/or increased maintenance (fertilizer or 
pesticide application) to maintain the desired appearance because of exposure to ambient ozone 
(U.S. EPA, 2007b).  In addition, many businesses rely on healthy-looking vegetation for their

 These estimates illustrate the value of vegetation effects from a substantial reduction of ozone concentrations, not 
the marginal change in ozone concentrations anticipated a result of the emission reductions achieved by this rule.   
 6-78 
livelihoods (e.g., horticulturalists, landscapers, Christmas tree growers, farmers of leafy crops, 
etc.) and a variety of ornamental species have been listed as sensitive to ozone (Abt Associates, 
1995).  The ornamental landscaping industry is valued at more than $30 billion (inflated to 2006 
dollars) annually, by both private property owners/tenants and by governmental units responsible 
for public areas (Abt Associates, 1995).  Therefore, urban ornamentals represent a potentially 
large unquantified benefit category.  This aesthetic damage may affect the enjoyment of urban 
parks by the public and homeowners‘ enjoyment of their landscaping and gardening activities.  
In the absence of adequate exposure-response functions and economic damage functions for the 
potential range of effects relevant to these types of vegetation, we cannot conduct a quantitative 
analysis to estimate these effects. 
6.5.6 Unquantified SO2 and NO2 -Related Human Health Benefits 
Following an extensive evaluation of health evidence from epidemiologic and laboratory 
studies, the Integrated Science Assessment for Sulfur Dioxide concluded that there is a causal 
relationship between respiratory health effects and short-term exposure to SO2 (U.S. EPA, 2008).  
The immediate effect of SO2 on the respiratory system in humans is bronchoconstriction.  
Asthmatics are more sensitive to the effects of SO2 likely resulting from preexisting 
inflammation associated with this disease.  A clear concentration-response relationship has been 
demonstrated in laboratory studies following exposures to SO2 at concentrations between 20 and 
100 ppb, both in terms of increasing severity of effect and percentage of asthmatics adversely 
affected. Based on our review of this information, we identified four short-term morbidity 
endpoints that the SO2 ISA identified as a ―causal relationship‖: asthma exacerbation, 
respiratory-related emergency department visits, and respiratory-related hospitalizations.  The 
differing evidence and associated strength of the evidence for these different effects is described 
in detail in the SO2 ISA.  The SO2 ISA also concluded that the relationship between short-term 
SO2 exposure and premature mortality was ―suggestive of a causal relationship‖ because it is 
difficult to attribute the mortality risk effects to SO2 alone.  Although the SO2 ISA stated that 
studies are generally consistent in reporting a relationship between SO2 exposure and mortality, 
there was a lack of robustness of the observed associations to adjustment for pollutants.  We did 
not quantify these benefits due to time constraints. 
Epidemiological researchers have associated NO2 exposure with adverse health effects in 
numerous toxicological, clinical and epidemiological studies, as described in the Integrated 
Science Assessment for Oxides of Nitrogen - Health Criteria (Final Report) (U.S. EPA, 2008c).  
The NO2 ISA provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence of health and 
environmental effects of NO2.  The NO2 ISA concluded that the evidence ―is sufficient to infer a 
 6-79 
likely causal relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and adverse effects on the 
respiratory system‖ (ISA, section 5.3.2.1).  These epidemiologic and experimental studies 
encompass a number of endpoints including [Emergency Department (ED)] visits and 
hospitalizations, respiratory symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, and 
lung function.  Effect estimates from epidemiologic studies conducted in the United States and 
Canada generally indicate a 2-20% increase in risks for ED visits and hospital admissions and 
higher risks for respiratory symptoms (ISA, section 5.4).  The NO2 ISA concluded that the 
relationship between short-term NO2 exposure and premature mortality was ―suggestive but not 
sufficient to infer a causal relationship‖ because it is difficult to attribute the mortality risk 
effects to NO2 alone.  Although the NO2 ISA stated that studies consistently reported a 
relationship between NO2 exposure and mortality, the effect was generally smaller than that for 
other pollutants such as PM.  We did not quantify these benefits due to time constraints. 
6.6 Social Cost of Carbon and Greenhouse Gas Benefits 
EPA has assigned a dollar value to reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions using 
recent estimates of the ―social cost of carbon‖ (SCC).  The SCC is an estimate of the monetized 
damages associated with an incremental increase in carbon emissions in a given year.  It is 
intended to include (but is not limited to) changes in net agricultural productivity, human health, 
property damages from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem services due to climate 
change.  The SCC estimates used in this analysis were developed through an interagency process 
that included EPA and other executive branch entities, and concluded in February 2010.  EPA 
first used these SCC estimates in the benefits analysis for the final joint EPA/DOT Rulemaking 
to establish Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy Standards; see the rule‘s preamble for discussion about application of SCC (75 
FR 25324; 5/7/10).  The SCC Technical Support Document (SCC TSD) provides a complete 
discussion of the methods used to develop these SCC estimates.

 The interagency group decided that these estimates apply only to CO2 emissions.  Given that warming profiles and 
impacts other than temperature change (e.g. ocean acidification) vary across GHGs, the group concluded 
 6-80 
2007 dollars.  The first three values are based on the average SCC from three integrated 
assessment models, at discount rates of 2.5, 3, and 5 percent, respectively.  SCCs at several 
discount rates are included because the literature shows that the SCC is quite sensitive to 
assumptions about the discount rate, and because no consensus exists on the appropriate rate to 
use in an intergenerational context. The fourth value is the 95th percentile of the SCC from all 
three models at a 3 percent discount rate.  It is included to represent higher-than-expected 
impacts from temperature change further out in the tails of the SCC distribution. Low 
probability, high impact events are incorporated into all of the SCC values through explicit 
consideration of their effects in two of the three models as well as the use of a probability density 
function for equilibrium climate sensitivity.  Treating climate sensitivity probabilistically results 
in more high temperature outcomes, which in turn lead to higher projections of damages. 
The SCC increases over time because future emissions are expected to produce larger 
incremental damages as physical and economic systems become more stressed in response to 
greater climatic change.  Note that the interagency group estimated the growth rate of the SCC 
directly using the three integrated assessment models rather than assuming a constant annual 
growth rate. This helps to ensure that the estimates are internally consistent with other modeling 
assumptions.  The SCC estimates for the analysis years of 2016, in 2007 dollars are provided in 
Table 6-15.

When attempting to assess the incremental economic impacts of carbon dioxide 
emissions, the analyst faces a number of serious challenges.  A recent report from the National 
Academies of Science (NRC 2009) points out that any assessment will suffer from uncertainty, 
speculation, and lack of information about (1) future emissions of greenhouse gases, (2) the 
effects of past and future emissions on the climate system, (3) the impact of changes in climate 
on the physical and biological environment, and (4) the translation of these environmental 
impacts into economic damages.  As a result, any effort to quantify and monetize the harms 
                                                                                                                                                             
―transforming gases into CO2-equivalents using GWP, and then multiplying the carbon-equivalents by the SCC, 
would not result in accurate estimates of the social costs of non-CO2 gases‖ (SCC TSD, pg. 13).

associated with climate change will raise serious questions of science, economics, and ethics and 
should be viewed as provisional. 
The interagency group noted a number of limitations to the SCC analysis, including the 
incomplete way in which the integrated assessment models capture catastrophic and non-
catastrophic impacts, their incomplete treatment of adaptation and technological change, 
uncertainty in the extrapolation of damages to high temperatures, and assumptions regarding risk 
aversion.  The limited amount of research linking climate impacts to economic damages makes 
the interagency modeling exercise even more difficult.  The interagency group hopes that over 
time researchers and modelers will work to fill these gaps and that the SCC estimates used for 
regulatory analysis by the Federal government will continue to evolve with improvements in 
modeling. Additional details on these limitations are discussed in the SCC TSD. 
In light of these limitations, the interagency group has committed to updating the current 
estimates as the science and economic understanding of climate change and its impacts on 
society improves over time.  Specifically, the interagency group has set a preliminary goal of 
revisiting the SCC values within two years from the February 2010 date of promulgation of the 
Light Duty Vehicle rule referenced above  or at such time as substantially updated models 
become available, and to continue to support research in this area. 
Applying the global SCC estimates to the estimated reductions in CO2 emissions for the 
range of policy scenarios, we estimate the dollar value of the climate related benefits captured by 
the models for each analysis year.  For internal consistency, the annual benefits are discounted 
back to NPV terms using the same discount rate as each SCC estimate (i.e. 5%, 3%, and 2.5%) 
rather than 3% and 7%.

It is possible that other benefits or costs of proposed regulations unrelated to CO2 emissions will be discounted at 
rates that differ from those used to develop the SCC estimates.

6.7 Benefits Results 
Applying the impact and valuation functions described previously in this chapter to the 
estimated changes in ozone and PM yields estimates of the changes in physical damages (e.g., 
premature mortalities, cases, admissions, and change in light extinction) and the associated 
monetary values for those changes.  Estimates of health impacts among Eastern and Western 
states, are presented in Table 6-15.  Monetized values for both health and welfare endpoints 
within the trading region are presented in Table 6-16, along with total aggregate monetized 
benefits. All of the monetary benefits are in constant-year 2007 dollars. 
Not all known PM- and ozone-related health and welfare effects could be quantified or 
monetized.  The monetized value of these unquantified effects is represented by adding an 
unknown ―B‖ to the aggregate total.  The estimate of total monetized health benefits is thus equal 
to the subset of monetized PM- and ozone-related health and welfare benefits plus B, the sum of 
the nonmonetized health and welfare benefits; this B represents both uncertainty and a bias in 
this analysis, as it reflects those benefits categories that we are unable quantify in this analysis.

 Economic value adjusted to 2007$ using GDP deflator. Estimates rounded to two significant figures. The 
negative estimates for certain endpoints are the result of the weak statistical power of the study used to 
calculate these health impacts and do not suggest that increases in air pollution exposure result in decreased 
health impacts. Confidence intervals reflect random sampling error and not the additional uncertainty 
associated with benefits scaling described above. The net present value of reduced CO2 emissions are 
calculated differently than other benefits. The same discount rate used to discount the value of damages from 
future emissions (SCC at 5, 3, 2.5 percent) is used to calculate net present value of SCC for internal 
consistency. This table shows monetized CO2 co-benefits at discount rates at 3 and 7 percent that were 
calculated using the global average SCC estimate at a 3% discount rate because the interagency workgroup on 
this topic deemed this marginal value to be the central value. In section 6.6 we also report he monetized CO2 
co-benefits using discount rates of 5 percent (average), 2.5 percent (average), and 3 percent (95
th
 percentile). 
b 
Monetary value of endpoints marked with dashes are < $100,000.  
 
Total monetized co-benefits are dominated by benefits of mortality risk reductions.  The 
primary analysis projects that the proposed Toxics Rule will result in between 6,800 and 17,000 
PM2.5 -related avoided premature deaths annually in 2016. Our estimate of total monetized co-
benefits in 2016 proposed Toxics Rule is between $59 billion and $140 billion using a 3 percent 
discount rate and between $53 billion and $130 using a 7 percent discount rate.  Health benefits 
account for between 93 and 97 percent of total benefits depending on the PM2.5 estimates used, 
in part because we are unable to quantify most of the non-health benefits.  The next largest 
benefit is for reductions in chronic illness (CB and nonfatal heart attacks), although this value is 
more than an order of magnitude lower than for premature mortality.  Hospital admissions for 
respiratory and cardiovascular causes, visibility, MRADs and work loss days account for the 
majority of the remaining benefits.  The remaining categories each account for a small 
percentage of total benefit; however, they represent a large number of avoided incidences 
affecting many individuals.  A comparison of the incidence table to the monetary benefits table 
reveals that there is not always a close correspondence between the number of incidences 
avoided for a given endpoint and the monetary value associated with that endpoint.  For 
example, there are over 100 times more work loss days than premature mortalities, yet work loss 
days account for only a very small fraction of total monetized benefits.  This reflects the fact that 
many of the less severe health effects, while more common, are valued at a lower level than the 
 6-86 
more severe health effects.  Also, some effects, such as hospital admissions, are valued using a 
proxy measure of WTP.  As such, the true value of these effects may be higher than that reported 
in Table 6-18. Figure 6-13 summarizes an array of PM2.5-related monetized benefits estimates 
based on alternative epidemiology and expert-derived PM-mortality estimate.

Based on our review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA estimated PM-
related mortality without applying an assumed concentration threshold. EPA‘s Integrated 
Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 2009b), which was reviewed by EPA‘s 
Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009b), 
concluded that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-threshold log-linear model 
most adequately portrays the PM-mortality concentration-response relationship while also 
recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape of the concentration-response function. 
Consistent with this finding, we incorporated a ―Lowest Measured Level‖ (LML) assessment, 
which is a method EPA has employed in several recent RIA‘s including the 2010 proposed 
Transport Rule (U.S. EPA, 2010c).

This approach summarizes the distribution of avoided PM mortality impacts according to 
the baseline (i.e. pre-Toxics Rule) PM2.5 levels experienced by the population receiving the 
PM2.5 mortality benefit (Figures 6-14 and 6-15). We identify on this figure the lowest air quality 
levels measured in each of the two primary epidemiological studies EPA uses to quantify PM-
related mortality. This information allows readers to determine the portion of PM-related 
mortality benefits occurring above or below the LML of each study; in general, our confidence in 
the estimated PM mortality decreases as we consider air quality levels further below the LML in 
the two epidemiological studies. While the LML analysis provides some insight into the level of 
uncertainty in the estimated PM mortality benefits, EPA does not view the LML as a threshold 
and continues to quantify PM-related mortality impacts using a full range of modeled air quality 
concentrations. While this figure describes the relationship between baseline PM2.5 exposure and 
mortality for the air quality modeled policy case, we expect the distribution of mortality impacts 
to be fairly similar between the two cases. 
Some proportion of the avoided PM-related impacts we estimate in this analysis occur 
among populations exposed at or above the LML of the Laden et al. (2006) study, while a 
majority of the impacts occur at or above the LML of the Pope et al. (2002) study (Figure 5-17), 
increasing our confidence in the PM mortality analysis. Approximately 30% of the avoided 
impacts occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 10 µg/m
3
 (the LML of the Laden et al. 
2006 study); about 86% occur at or above an annual mean PM2.5 level of 7.5 µg/m
3 
(the LML of 
the Pope et al. 2002 study). As we model mortality impacts among populations exposed to levels 
of PM2.5 that are successively lower than the LML of each study our confidence in the results 
diminishes. 
While the LML of each study is important to consider when characterizing and 
interpreting the overall level PM-related benefits, as discussed earlier in this chapter, EPA 
believes that both cohort-based mortality estimates are suitable for use in air pollution health 
impact analyses. When estimating PM mortality impacts using risk coefficients drawn from the 
Laden et al. analysis of the Harvard Six Cities and the Pope et al. analysis of the American 
Cancer Society cohorts there are innumerable other attributes that may affect the size of the 
reported risk estimates—including differences in population demographics, the size of the 
cohort, activity patterns and particle composition among others. The LML assessment presented 
here provides a limited representation of one key difference between the two studies.

6.8 Discussion 
This analysis demonstrates the significant health and welfare co-benefits of the Toxics 
Rule. We estimate that by 2016 the rule will have reduced the number of PM2.5 and ozone-
related premature mortalities by between 6,800 and 17,000, produce substantial non-mortality 
benefits and significantly improve visibility in Class 1 areas. This rule promises to yield 
significant welfare impacts as well, though the quantification of those endpoints in this RIA is 
incomplete.  These significant health and welfare benefits suggest the important role that 
pollution from the EGU sector plays in the public health impacts of air pollution. 
Inherent in any complex RIA such as this one are multiple sources of uncertainty. Some 
of these we characterized through our quantification of statistical error in the concentration 
response relationships and our use of the expert elicitation-derived PM mortality functions. 
Others, including the projection of atmospheric conditions and source-level emissions, the 
projection of baseline morbidity rates, incomes and technological development are unquantified. 
 6-90 
When evaluated within the context of these uncertainties, the health impact and monetized 
benefits estimates in this RIA can provide useful information regarding the public health impacts 
attributable to EGUs.

APPENDIX C.  
CO-BENEFITS APPENDIX 
In section 1 of this appendix to the co-benefits chapter we report the results of the air 
quality modeled scenario before it was adjusted to account for the updated emissions scenario. In 
section 2 we characterize the distribution of avoided PM2.5-related premature deaths according to 
the baseline level of air pollution-related risk of the population. 
C.1 PM2.5-Related Health Impacts and Monetized Benefits of the Air Quality Modeled 
Scenario 
As noted in Chapter 6 of the RIA, the air quality modeling performed for the RIA does 
not reflect the changes in emissions of PM2.5 precursors associated with the revised policy case. 
For this reason, we updated the benefits analysis to account for the updated policy case using 
methods described in the benefits chapter. In this appendix, we detail the results of the benefits 
analysis associated with the modeled scenario.  Chapter 4 of the RIA describes in detail the air 
quality modeling results. As described in the benefits chapter, the chief difference between the 
modeled and revised cases relate to the level and distribution of SO2 and NOx emission 
reductions: 
While the modeled and revised policy case achieve roughly similar levels of 
SO2 reductions (2.35M versus 2.06M, respectively), the modeled case 
concentrates SO2 reductions primarily among a few Midwestern and 
southeastern states, while the revised case distributes SO2 reductions more 
evenly across both the Midwest, southeast and west. Likewise, the modeled case 
generates the largest NOx reductions in the Midwest, while the revised case 
shifts these reductions to western states including Montana, Colorado and Utah. 
Tables C-1 and C-2 summarize the PM2.5-related health impacts and monetized benefits 
by each health endpoint. Figure C-1 illustrates the distribution of avoided PM-related deaths by 
county across the U.S.

C.2 Characterizing the distribution of health impacts across the population 
This analysis aims to answer two principal questions regarding the distribution of PM2.5 
co-benefits resulting from the implementation of the proposed Toxics Rule: 
1. What is the baseline distribution of PM2.5-related mortality risk according to race, 
income and education? 
2. To what extent does the Toxics Rule deliver PM2.5 co-benefits among those 
populations at greatest risk in the baseline? 
C.2.1 Methodology 
As a first step, we estimate the level of PM2.5-related mortality risk in each county in the 
continental U.S. in 2005, which provides a baseline against which projected changes in PM2.5 
risk attributable to the Toxics rule may be compared. This portion of the analysis follows an 
approach described elsewhere (Fann et al. 2011a, Fann et al. 2011b), wherein modeled 2005 
PM2.5 levels are used to calculate the proportion of total mortality risk attributable to PM2.5 in 
each county. Within each county, we next estimate the distribution of these PM2.5 mortality risks 
for all adult populations as well as risk according to the race, income and educational attainment 
of the population. 
Our approach to calculating PM2.5 mortality risk is generally consistent with the primary 
analysis with the two exceptions: the PM mortality risk coefficients used to quantify impacts and 
the baseline mortality rates used to calculate mortality impacts. We substitute risk estimates 
drawn from the Krewski et al. (2009) extended analysis of the ACS cohort. In particular, we 
applied the all-cause mortality risk estimate random effects Cox model that controls for 44 
individual and 7 ecological covariates, using average exposure levels for 1999-2000 over 116 
U.S. cities (Krewski et al. 2009) (RR=1.06, 95% confidence intervals 1.04—1.08 per 10µg/m3 
increase in PM2.5). When estimating PM mortality impacts among populations according to level 
of education, we applied PM2.5 mortality risk coefficients modified by educational attainment: 
less than grade 12 (RR = 1.082, 95% confidence intervals 1.024—1.144 per 10 µg/m3 change), 
grade 12 (RR = 1.072, 95% confidence intervals 1.020—1.127 per 10 µg/m3 change), and greater 
than grade 12 (RR = 1.055, 95% confidence intervals 1.018—1.094 per 10 µg/m3 change). The 
principal reason we applied risk estimates from the Krewski study was to ensure that the risk 
coefficients used to estimate of all-cause mortality risk and education-modified mortality risk 
were drawn from a consistent modeling framework. 
The other key difference between this sensitivity analysis and the primary analysis relates 
to the baseline mortality rates. As described in the benefits chapter, we calculate PM-related 
 C-6 
mortality risk relative to baseline mortality rates in each county. Traditionally we have applied 
county-level age and sex stratified rates when calculating these impacts (Abt, 2008). For the 
calculation of PM impacts by race, we incorporated race-specific (stratified by 
white/black/asian/Native American) baseline mortality rates. 
This approach yields a distribution of county-level risks stratified by each of these 
population variables (race, income and educational attainment). We next identified the counties 
at the median and upper 95
th
 percentile of the distribution. The second step of the analysis was to 
repeat the sequence above by estimating PM2.5 mortality risk in 2016 prior to, and after, the 
implementation of the proposed Toxics Rule. 
C.2.2 Results 
The level of PM2.5 mortality risk among all populations declines significantly between 
2005, 2016 prior to, and then after, the implementation of the Toxics rule (Figures C-2—C4). In 
each figure we outline in yellow those counties at or above the 2005 median risk level. The 
number of counties at or above this level falls significantly between 2005 and the 
implementation of the 2016 Toxics rule, suggesting that the combination of this rule as well as 
others being implemented between 2005 and 2016 are reducing greatly the level of PM mortality 
risk among adult populations. 
We next stratify the PM mortality risk according to race, income and educational 
attainment. For these analyses we estimated the change in PM mortality risk between 2005 and 
2016 among populations living in those counties at the upper 95
th
 percentile of the mortality risk 
in the baseline; we then compared the change in risk among these populations living in high-risk 
counties with populations living in all other counties. Figures C-5—C-7 summarize these results.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROFILE 
This chapter discusses important aspects of the power sector that relate to the Air Toxics 
Rule, including the types of power-sector sources affected by the Rule, and provides background 
on the power sector and electric generating units (EGUs). 
7.1 Power Sector Overview 
The production and delivery of electricity to customers consists of three distinct 
segments: generation, transmission, and distribution. 
7.1.1 Generation 
Electricity generation is the first process in the delivery of electricity to consumers.  Most 
of the existing capacity for generating electricity involves creating heat to rotate turbines which, 
in turn, create electricity.  The power sector consists of over 17,000 generating units, comprising 
fossil-fuel-fired units, nuclear units, and hydroelectric and other renewable sources dispersed 
throughout the country (see Table 7-1).

These electric generating sources provide electricity for commercial, industrial, and 
residential uses, each of which consumes roughly a quarter to a third of the total electricity 
produced (see Table 7-2).  Some of these uses are highly variable, such as heating and air 
 7-2 
conditioning in residential and commercial buildings, while others are relatively constant, such 
as industrial processes that operate 24 hours a day.

  Source:  EIA Electric Power Annual 2009, Table 7.2 
In 2009, electric generating sources produced 3,950 billion kWh to meet electricity 
demand.  Roughly 70 percent of this electricity was produced through the combustion of fossil 
fuels, primarily coal and natural gas, with coal accounting for almost half of the total (see 
Table 7-3).

Note: Retail sales and net generation are not equal because net generation includes net exported electricity and 
loss of electricity that occurs through transmission and distribution. 
Coal-fired generating units typically supply ―base-load‖ electricity, the portion of 
electricity loads which are continually present, and typically operate throughout the day.  Along 
with nuclear generation, these coal units meet the part of demand that is relatively constant.  
Although much of the coal fleet operates as base load, there can be notable differences across 
various facilities (see Table 7-4).  For example, coal-fired units less than 100 MW in size 
comprise 37 percent of the total number of coal-fired units, but only 6 percent of total coal-fired 
capacity.  Gas-fired generation is better able to vary output and is the primary option used to 
meet the variable portion of the electricity load and typically supplies ―peak‖ power, when there 
is increased demand for electricity (for example, when businesses operate throughout the day or 
 7-3 
when people return home from work and run appliances and heating/air-conditioning), versus 
late at night or very early in the morning, when demand for electricity is reduced.

7.1.2 Transmission 
Transmission is the term used to describe the movement of electricity over a network of 
high voltage lines, from electric generators to substations where power is stepped down for local 
distribution.  In the US and Canada, there are three separate interconnected networks of high 
voltage transmission lines1, each operating at a common frequency.  Within each of these 
transmission networks, there are multiple areas where the operation of power plants is monitored 
and controlled to ensure that electricity generation and load are kept in balance.  In some areas, 
the operation of the transmission system is under the control of a single regional operator; in 
others, individual utilities coordinate the operations of their generation, transmission, and 
distribution systems to balance their common generation and load needs. 
7.1.3 Distribution 
Distribution of electricity involves networks of lower voltage lines and substations that 
take the higher voltage power from the transmission system and step it down to lower voltage 
levels to match the needs of customers.  The transmission and distribution system is the classic 
example of a natural monopoly, in part because it is not practical to have more than one set of 
lines running from the electricity generating sources to substations or from substations to 
residences and business. 
Transmission has generally been developed by the larger vertically integrated utilities 
that typically operate generation and distribution networks.  Distribution is handled by a large 
number of utilities that often purchase and sell electricity, but do not generate it.  Transmission 
and distribution have been considered differently from generation in efforts to restructure the 
industry.  As discussed below, electricity restructuring has focused primarily on efforts to 
reorganize the industry to encourage competition in the generation segment of the industry, 
including ensuring open access of generation to the transmission and distribution services needed 
to deliver power to consumers.  In many state efforts, this has also included separating 
generation assets from transmission and distribution assets into distinct economic entities.  
Transmission and distribution remain price-regulated throughout the country based on the cost of 
service.

 These three network interconnections are the western US and Canada, corresponding approximately to the area 
west of the Rocky Mountains; eastern US and Canada, not including most of Texas; and a third network 
operating in most of Texas.  These are commonly referred to as the Western Interconnect Region, Eastern 
Interconnect Region, and ERCOT, respectively.

7.2 Deregulation and Restructuring 
The process of restructuring and deregulation of wholesale and retail electric markets has 
changed the structure of the electric power industry.  In addition to reorganizing asset 
management between companies, restructuring sought a functional unbundling of the generation, 
transmission, distribution, and ancillary services the power sector has historically provided, with 
the aim of enhancing competition in the generation segment of the industry. 
Beginning in the 1970s, government policy shifted against traditional regulatory 
approaches and in favor of deregulation for many important industries, including transportation 
(notably commercial airlines), communications, and energy, which were all thought to be natural 
monopolies (prior to 1970) that warranted governmental control of pricing.  However, 
deregulation efforts in the power sector were most active during the 1990s.  Some of the primary 
drivers for deregulation of electric power included the desire for more efficient investment 
choices, the possibility of lower electric rates, reduced costs of combustion turbine technology 
that opened the door for more companies to sell power, and complexity of monitoring utilities‘ 
cost of service and establishing cost-based rates for various customer classes (see Figure 7-2). 
The pace of restructuring in the electric power industry slowed significantly in response 
to market volatility and financial turmoil associated with bankruptcy filings of key energy 
companies in California.  By the end of 2001, restructuring had either been delayed or suspended 
in eight states that previously enacted legislation or issued regulatory orders for its 
implementation (shown as ―Suspended‖ in Figure 7-2 below).  Another 18 other states that had 
seriously explored the possibility of deregulation in 2000 reported no legislative or regulatory 
activity in 2001 (DOE, EIA, 2003a) (―Not Active‖ in Figure 7-2 below).  Currently, there are 15 
states where price deregulation of generation (restructuring) has occurred (―Active‖ in Figure 7-2 
below).  The effort is more or less at a standstill; there have been no recent proposals to the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for actions aimed at wider restructuring, and no 
additional states have begun retail deregulation activity

7.3 Pollution and EPA Regulation of Emissions 
The burning of fossil fuels, which generates about 70 percent of our electricity 
nationwide, results in air emissions of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs): mercury, acid gasses, 
and non-mercury metallic particulates.  Additionally, SO2 and NOx emissions from the power 
sector are important precursors in the formation of fine particles and ozone (NOx only).  The 
power sector is a major contributor of all of these pollutants. 
Fossil fuel-fired units vary widely in their air emissions levels for HAPs, particularly 
when uncontrolled.  In 2009, based on the Utility MACT Information Collection Request, HCl 
emissions from coal-fired units range from less than 0.00002 lb/mmBtu (for a unit with a 
scrubber) to over 0.1 lb/mmBtu.  Mercury emissions range from less than 0.3 lb/TBtu to more 
than 20 lbs/TBtu.  Emissions of fine particulates less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5) range 
from 0.002 lb/mmBtu to over 0.06 lb/mmBtu.  For an uncontrolled plant, acid gas, mercury, and 
particulate emissions are directly related to the elemental profile and ash content of the coal 
burned. 
Oil-fired units also have a wide range of HAP emissions.  In 2009, based on the Utility 
MACT Information Collection Request, HCl emissions from oil-fired units range from less than 
0.00001 lb/mmBtu (for a unit with a scrubber) to over 0.003 lb/mmBtu.  Mercury emissions 
 7-7 
range from less than 0.01 lb/TBtu to more than 60 lbs/TBtu.  Emissions PM2.5 range from less 
than 0.004 lb/mmBtu to over 0.07 lb/mmBtu. 
7.4 Pollution Control Technologies 
Acid gas HAPs (e.g., hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF), sulfur dioxide 
(SO2)) from coal-fired power plants are controlled by fuel selection, fuel blending, or post 
combustion controls.  Fossil fuels, and particularly coal, vary widely in the content of pollutants 
like chlorine (Cl), fluorine (F), sulfur (S) and other HAPs, making fuel blending and/or switching 
an effective method for reducing emissions of HAPs.  In general, it is easier to switch fuels 
within a coal rank (rather than across a coal rank) due to similar heat contents and other 
characteristics.  Completely switching fuels across ranks tends to trigger more costly 
modifications.  As a compromise, blending is employed when a complete fuel switch adversely 
affects the unit.  Electric generating units (EGUs) may also choose to retrofit post combustion 
controls to achieve superior pollutant removal.  Post-combustion controls typically remove larger 
proportions of HCl and HF than SO2 due to differences in molecular weight. 
Acid gas emissions (including SO2) can be reduced with flue gas desulfurization (FGD, 
also known as ―scrubbers‖) or with dry sorbent injection (DSI).  EGUs may choose either ―wet‖ 
and ―dry‖ configurations of scrubbers.  Wet scrubbers can use a variety of reagents including 
crushed limestone, quick lime, and magnesium-enhanced lime. The choice of reagent affects 
performance, size, capital and operating costs.  Current wet scrubber technology is capable of 
removing at least 99 percent of HF and HCl emissions while simultaneously achieving 
96 percent SO2 removal.  Modern dry FGD technology incorporates a lime-based slurry with a 
downstream fabric filter to remove at least 93 percent SO2 while also capturing over 99 percent 
HCL and HF.  An alternative to wet and dry scrubber technology is dry sorbent injection (DSI), 
which injects an alkaline powdered material (post combustion) to react with the acid gases.  The 
reacted product is removed by particulate matter (PM) control device.  DSI technology is most 
efficient with a baghouse present downstream but can function with an electrostatic precipitator 
(ESP) downstream as well.  Under these circumstances, the ESP requires more reagent per 
molecule of acid gas removed as compared to a similar operation with a baghouse.  Finally, DSI 
may employ a multitude of sorbents (trona1, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate – and their 
bicarbonate counterparts) for a more tailored approach to reduce emissions based on the source, 
cost, and unit and fuel characteristics.

 Trona refers to the chemical compound sodium sesquicarbonate. 
 7-8 
Mercury capture requires multiple controls to achieve removal.  Upon combustion, 
mercury exits the furnace in three forms: elemental, oxidized, and as a particulate.  Elemental 
mercury is emitted out of the stack.  The particulate form is bound to the ash and removed by PM 
control equipment - either ESP or fabric filter.  A portion of mercury that has converted to 
oxidized compounds may be removed by either a wet scrubber or by activated carbon injection 
(ACI).  The removal mechanism is different between these two control devices; the wet FGD 
system captures oxidized mercury because it is water soluble, while activated carbon injection 
provides a unique physical surface to which oxidized mercury can absorb.  Mercury oxidation 
can occur at multiple locations within a unit as long as an oxidizing agent (namely, a halogen) is 
present for reaction; this allows the unit operator some latitude in selecting a control method and 
injection point based on existing equipment at the particular source.  Halogen can be introduced 
to the fuel prior to combustion, injected directly into the furnace, introduced upstream of a 
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system (primarily used for NOx control but which also 
promotes mercury oxidation), infused with the activated carbon injections, or the unit operator 
may increase halogens by blending in higher chlorine fuels (e.g., Powder River Basin fuel 
blended with bituminous coal).  Operating a wet FGD for SO2 control alongside selective 
catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx control with sufficient halogen present will remove more than 
90 percent of the mercury within the flue gas stream.  On the other hand, if the existing unit is 
absent a wet FGD, activated carbon injection (ACI) can be employed for mercury capture with at 
least 90% removal using a downstream fabric filter; an ESP results in less efficient mercury 
removal with ACI. 
Non-mercury heavy metals and organics are removed by PM control equipment such as 
fabric filters (FF) and electrostatic precipitators (ESP).  Unlike mercury, the heavy metals (e.g., 
selenium and arsenic) are non-volatile and affix to the ash.  Likewise, any organics surviving the 
high temperature combustion process are non-volatile and bind to the ash.  Both control 
technologies are capable of removing more than 99 percent of particulates greater than 2.5 
microns in size (PM2.5) from the emissions stream.  ESPs sap relatively little pressure (energy) 
from the flue gas but are less flexible to fuel switching, since their design basis focuses on a 
specific intended fuel.  Fuel switching or blending that increases gas flow rate, ash resistivity, or 
particle loading may render an existing ESP insufficient for removing particulate matter.  ESPs 
also suffer from ash re-entrainment, which is the release of particulate matter from the last 
compartment due to the self cleaning action).  On the other hand, an ESP with sufficient design 
margin may succeed with these fuel alterations.  Conversely, a fabric filter does not suffer from 
these particulate removal limitations.  Moreover, the fabric filter readily lends itself to mercury 
and acid gas removal since DSI and ACI operate more efficiently with a baghouse.  When 
 7-9 
considering retrofit PM control options, a unit with an existing ESP will examine upgrading the 
precipitator as an alternative to installing a new fabric filter to achieve emission reductions. 
For more detail on the cost and performance assumptions of pollution controls, see the 
documentation for the Integrated Planning Model (IPM), a dynamic linear programming model 
that EPA uses to examine air pollution control policies for various air emissions throughout the 
United States for the entire power system.  Documentation for IPM can be found at 
www.epa.gov/airmarkets/epa-ipm. 
7.5 Air Regulation of the Power Sector 
At the federal level, efforts to reduce emissions have been occurring since 1970.  Policy 
makers have recognized the need to address these harmful emissions, and incremental steps have 
been taken to ensure that the country meets air quality standards.  The Toxics Rule is the next 
step towards further protecting public health by reducing harmful HAP emissions. 
7.5.1 SO2 and NOX Reduction 
Even before widespread regulation of SO2 and NOx for the power sector, total suspended 
particulate matter (TSP) was a related target of state and federal action.  Because larger 
particulates are visible as dark smoke from smokestacks, most states had regulations by 1970 
limiting the opacity of emissions.  Requirements for taller smokestacks also mitigated local 
impacts of TSP.  Notably, such regulations effectively addressed large-diameter, filterable 
particulate matter rather than condensable particulate matter (such as PM2.5) associated with SO2 
and NOx emissions, which are not visible at the smokestack and have impacts far from their 
sources. 
Federal regulation of SO2 and NOx emissions at power plants began with the 1970 Clean 
Air Act.  The Act required the Agency to develop New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) 
for a number of source categories including coal-fired power plants.  The first NSPS for power 
plants (subpart D) required new units to limit SO2 emissions either by using scrubbers or by 
using low sulfur coal.  NOx was required to be limited through the use of low NOx burners.  A 
new NSPS (subpart Da), promulgated in 1978, tightened the standards for SO2, requiring 
scrubbers on all new units. 
The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) placed a number of new requirements on 
power plants.  The Acid Rain Program, established under Title IV of the 1990 CAAA, requires 
major reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions.  The SO2 program sets a permanent cap on the total 
amount of SO2 that can be emitted by electric power plants in the contiguous United States at 
 7-10 
about one-half of the amount of SO2 these sources emitted in 1980.  Using a market-based cap 
and trade mechanism allows flexibility for individual combustion units to select their own 
methods of compliance with the SO2 reduction requirements.  The program uses a more 
traditional approach to NOx emissions limitations for certain coal-fired electric utility boilers, 
with the objective of achieving a 2 million ton reduction from projected NOx emission levels that 
would have been emitted in 2000 without implementation of Title IV. 
The Acid Rain Program comprises two phases for SO2 and NOx.  Phase I applied 
primarily to the largest coal-fired electric generating sources from 1995 through 1999 for SO2 
and from 1996 through 1999 for NOx.  Phase II for both pollutants began in 2000.  For SO2, it 
applies to thousands of combustion units generating electricity nationwide; for NOx it generally 
applies to affected units that burned coal during 1990 through 1995.  The Acid Rain Program has 
led to the installation of a number of scrubbers on existing coal-fired units as well as significant 
fuel switching to lower sulfur coals.  Under the NOx provisions of Title IV, most existing 
coal-fired units installed low NOx burners. 
The CAAA also placed much greater emphasis on control of NOx to reduce ozone 
nonattainment.  This led to the formation of several regional NOx trading programs as well as 
intrastate NOx trading programs in states such as Texas.  The northeastern states of the Ozone 
Transport Commission (OTC) required existing sources to meet Reasonably Available Control 
Technology (RACT) limits on NOx in 1995 and in 1999 began an ozone-season cap and trade 
program to achieve deeper reductions.  In 1998, EPA promulgated regulations (the NOx SIP 
Call) that required 21 states in the eastern United States and the District of Columbia to reduce 
NOx emissions that contributed to nonattainment in downwind states using the cap and trade 
approach.  This program began in May of 2003 and has resulted in the installation of significant 
amounts of selective catalytic reduction. 
The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) built on EPA‘s efforts in the NOx SIP call to 
address specifically interstate pollution transport for ozone, and was EPA‘s first attempt to 
address interstate pollution transport for PM2.5.  It required significant reductions in emissions of 
SO2 and NOx in 28 states and the District of Columbia (see Figure 7-3 below).  EGUs were 
found to be a major source of the SO2 and NOx emissions which contributed to fine particle 
concentrations and ozone problems downwind.  Although the D.C. Circuit remanded the rule to 
EPA in 2008, it did so without vacatur, allowing the rule to remain in effect while EPA addresses 
the remand.  Thus, CAIR is continuing to help states address ozone and PM2.5 nonattainment and 
improve visibility by reducing transported precursors of SO2 and NOx through the 
 7-11 
implementation of three separate cap and trade compliance programs for annual NOx, ozone 
season NOx, and annual SO2 emissions from power plants. 
Figure 7-3. States Covered under the Clean Air Interstate Rule 
 
Perhaps in anticipation of complying with CAIR, especially the more stringent second 
phase that was set to begin in 2015, several sources have recently been installing or planning to 
install advanced controls for SO2 and NOx to begin operating in the 2010 to 2015 timeframe.  
Many EPA New Source Review (NSR) settlements also require controls in those years, as do 
state rules in Georgia, Illinois, and Maryland.  States like North Carolina, New York, 
Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Delaware have also moved to control these emissions to address 
nonattainment.  Thus both federal and state efforts are continuing to bring about sizeable 
reductions in SO2 and NOx from the power sector. 
On July 6, 2010, the U.S. EPA proposed the Transport Rule, designed to replace CAIR.  
A December 2008 court decision kept the requirements of CAIR in place temporarily but 
directed EPA to issue a new rule to implement the Clean Air Act requirements concerning the 
transport of air pollution across state boundaries.  The proposed rule would require 31 states and 
the District of Columbia to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions, which contribute to ozone and fine 
particle pollution in other states, beginning in 2012 (see Figure 7-4). 
 7-12 
Figure 7-4. States Covered under the Transport Rule 
 
7.5.2 HAP Regulation 
In 2000, EPA made a finding that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate coal- and 
oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) under CAA section 112 and listed EGUs 
pursuant to CAA section 112(c).  On March 29, 2005 (70 FR 15,994), EPA published a final rule 
(Section 112(n) Revision Rule) that removed EGUs from the list of sources for which regulation 
under CAA section 112 was required.  That rule was published in conjunction with a rule 
requiring reductions in emissions of mercury from electric utility steam generating units pursuant 
to section 111 of the CAA (Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), May 18, 2005, 70 FR 28606).  
The Section 112(n) Revision Rule was vacated on February 8, 2008, by the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  As a result of that vacatur, CAMR was also 
vacated and EGUs remain on the list of sources that must be regulated under CAA section 112.  
This action provides EPA‘s proposed rule in response to the court‘s decisions.  Under authority 
of section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is proposing a national emissions standard for 
HAP emissions, covering EGUs (also known as the Toxics Rule).  The pollution control required 
to make HAP reductions will also result in SO2 and NOX reductions. 
7.6 Revenues, Expenses, and Prices 
Due to lower retail electricity sales, total utility operating revenues declined in 2009 to 
$276 billion from a peak of almost $300 billion in 2009.  However, operating expenses were 
appreciably lower and as a result, net income actually rose modestly compared to 2008 (see 
 7-13 
Table 7-5).  Recent economic events have put downward pressure on electricity demand, thus 
dampening electricity prices (utility revenues), but have also reduced the price and cost of fossil 
fuels and other expenses.  Electricity sales and revenues associated with the generation, 
transmission, and distribution of electricity are expected to rebound and increase modestly by 
2015, where they are projected to be roughly $360 billion (see Table 7-6).

Notes: Data is from EIA‘s AEO 2011, and is derived by taking either total electricity use (for generation) or sales 
(transmission and distribution) and multiplying by forecasted prices by service category from Table 8 (Electricity 
Supply, Disposition, Prices, and Emissions). 
 7-14 
Based on EIA‘s Annual Energy Outlook 2011, Table 7-6 shows that in the base case, the 
power sector is expected to derive revenues of $360 billion in 2015.  Table 7-5 shows that 
investor-owned utilities (IOUs) earned income of about 11.5% compared to total revenues in 
2009.  Assuming the same income ratio from IOUs (with no income kept by public power), and 
using the same proportion of power sales from public power as observed in 2009, EPA projects 
that the power sector will expend over $320 billion in 2015 alone to generate, transmit, and 
distribute electricity to end-use consumers. 
Over the past 50 years, real retail electricity prices have ranged from around 7 cents per 
kWh in the early 1970‘s, to around 11 cents, reached in the early 1980‘s.  Generally, retail 
electricity prices do not change rapidly and do not display the variability of other energy or 
commodity prices.  Retail rate regulation has largely insulated consumers from the rising and 
falling wholesale electricity price signals whose variation on an hourly, daily, and seasonal basis 
is critical for driving lowest-cost matching of supply and demand.  In fact, the real price of 
electricity today is lower than it was in the early 1960s and 1980s (see Figure 7-5).

On a state-by-state basis, retail electricity prices vary considerably.  The Northeast and 
California have average retail prices that can be as much as double those of other states. (see 
Figure 7-6)

The natural gas market in the United States has historically experienced significant price 
volatility from year to year, between seasons within a year, and can even undergo major price 
swings during short-lived weather events (such as cold snaps leading to short-run spikes in 
heating demand).  Over the last decade, gas prices have ranged from $3 per mmBtu to as high as 
$9 on an annual average basis (see Figure 7-7).  During that time, the daily price of natural gas 
reached as high as $15/mmBtu.  Recent forecasts of natural gas have also experienced 
considerable revision as new sources of gas have been discovered and come to market.

7.7 Electricity Demand and Demand Response 
Electricity performs a vital and high-value function in the economy.  Historically, growth 
in electricity consumption has been closely aligned with economic growth.  Overall, the U.S. 
economy has become more efficient over time, producing more output (GDP) per unit of energy 
input, with per capita energy use fairly constant over the past 30 years (see Figure 7-8).  The 
growth rate of electricity demand has also been in overall decline for the past sixty years (see 
Figure 7-9), with several key drivers that are worth noting.  First, there has been a significant 
structural shift in the U.S. economy towards less energy-intensive sectors, like services.  Second, 
companies have strong financial incentives to reduce energy expenditures.  Third, companies are 
responding to the marketplace and continually develop and bring to market new technologies 
that reduce energy consumption.  Fourth, complementary policies and energy efficiency 
standards at the state and Federal level have helped address market failures.  These broader 
changes have altered the outlook for future electricity growth (see Figure 7-9).

Energy efficiency initiatives have become more common, and investments in energy 
efficiency are projected to continue to increase for the next 5 to 10 years, driven in part by the 
growing number of states that have adopted energy efficiency resource standards.  These 
investments, and other energy efficiency policies at both the state and federal level, create 
incentives to reduce energy consumption and peak load.  According to EIA, demand-side

management provided actual peak load reductions of 31.7 GW in 2009.  For context, the current 
coal fleet is roughly 320 GW of capacity. 
Demand for electricity, especially in the short run, is not very sensitive to changes in 
prices and is considered relatively price inelastic, although some demand reduction does occur in 
response to price.  With that in mind, EPA modeling does not typically incorporate a ―demand 
response‖ in its electric generation modeling (Chapter 8) to the increases in electricity prices 
typically projected for EPA rulemakings.  Electricity demand is considered to be constant in 
EPA modeling applications and the reduction in production costs that would result from lower 
demand is not considered in the primary analytical scenario that is modeled.  This leads to some 
overstatement in the private compliance costs that EPA estimates.  Notably, the ―compliance 
costs‖ are the changes in the electric power generation costs in the base case and pollution 
control options that are evaluated in Chapter 8.  In simple terms, it is the resource costs of what 
the power industry will directly expend to comply with EPA‘s requirements.

COST, ECONOMIC, AND ENERGY IMPACTS 
This chapter reports the cost, economic, and energy impact analysis performed for the 
Toxics Rule.  EPA used the Integrated Planning Model (IPM), developed by ICF Consulting, to 
conduct its analysis.  IPM is a dynamic linear programming model that can be used to examine 
air pollution control policies for SO2, NOx, Hg, HCl, and other air pollutants throughout the 
United States for the entire power system.  Documentation for IPM can be found at 
http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm, and updates specific to the Toxics Rule 
modeling are in the ―Documentation Supplement for EPA Base Case v.4.10_PTox – Updates for 
Proposed Toxics Rule.‖ 
8.1 Background 
Over the last decade, EPA has on several occasions used IPM to consider control options 
for reducing power-sector emissions.  Many EPA analyses with IPM have focused on legislative 
proposals with national scope, such as EPA‘s IPM analyses of the Clean Air Planning Act (S.843 
in 108th Congress), the Clean Power Act (S.150 in 109th Congress), the Clear Skies Act of 2005 
(S.131 in 109th Congress), the Clear Skies Act of 2003 (S.485 in 108th Congress), and the Clear 
Skies Manager‘s Mark (of S.131).  These analyses are available at EPA‘s website: 
(http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-ipm/index.html).  EPA also analyzed several multi-
pollutant reduction scenarios in July 2009 at the request of Senator Tom Carper to illustrate the 
costs and benefits of multiple levels of SO2 and NOx control in the power sector. 
In addition, EPA conducted extensive state-by-state analysis of control levels and 
associated emissions projections related to upwind pollution contribution across state borders to 
downwind air quality monitors for the proposed Transport Rule.  More details on this analysis 
can be found in the Federal Register1 and Significant Contribution Approach TSD for the 
proposed Transport Rule.2 
As discussed in Chapter 7, the proposed Toxics Rule coincides with a period when many 
new pollution controls are being installed.  Many are needed for compliance with NSR 
settlements and state rules, while others may have been planned in expectation of CAIR and its 
replacement, the Transport Rule.  Because CAIR remains in effect until it is replaced by the 
Transport Rule, the power sector is continuing to make emission reductions in the eastern US.

 8-2 
The base case in this RIA assumes that the Transport Rule is in effect and takes into 
account emissions reductions associated with the implementation of all federal rules, state rules 
and statutes, and other binding, enforceable commitments in place by December 2010 that are 
applicable to the power industry and which govern the installation and operation of pollution 
controls in the timeframe covered in the analysis. 
EPA has made these base case assumptions recognizing that the power sector will install 
a significant amount of pollution controls in response to several requirements.  The inclusion of 
the proposed Transport Rule and other regulatory actions (including federal, state, and local 
actions) in the base case is necessary in order to reflect the level of controls that are likely to be 
in place in response to other requirements apart from the Toxics Rule. This base case will 
provide meaningful projections of how the power sector will respond to all the regulatory 
requirements for air emissions in totality, while isolating the incremental impacts of the proposed 
Toxics Rule relative to a base case with other air emission reduction requirements separate from 
today‘s action.  While the Transport Rule could change when it is finalized, EPA believes that 
this updated modeling of the proposed Transport Rule is a satisfactory representation of 
requirements under the CAA that address air transport under 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I), and subsequent 
analyses for the Toxics Rule after its proposal should reflect the Transport Rule as finalized. 
The model‘s base case features an updated Title IV SO2 allowance bank assumption and 
incorporates updates related to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  Some 
modeling assumptions, most notably the projected demand for electricity, are based on the 2010 
Annual Energy Outlook from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  In addition, the 
model includes existing policies affecting emissions from the power sector: the Title IV of the 
Clean Air Act (the Acid Rain Program); the NOx SIP Call; various New Source Review (NSR) 
settlements;1 and several state rules2 affecting emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 that were 
finalized through Fall of 2010.  IPM includes state rules that have been finalized and/or approved 
by a state‘s legislature or environmental agency.  The IPM documentation TSD contains details

 The NSR settlements include agreements between EPA and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company 
(Vectren), Public Service Enterprise Group, Tampa Electric Company, We Energies (WEPCO), Virginia Electric 
& Power Company (Dominion), Santee Cooper, Minnkota Power Coop, American Electric Power (AEP), East 
Kentucky Power Cooperative (EKPC), Nevada Power Company, Illinois Power, Mirant, Ohio Edison, Kentucky 
Utilities, Hoosier Energy, Salt River Project, Westar, Puerto Rico Power Authority, Duke Energy, American 
Municipal Power, and Dayton Power and Light. These agreements lay out specific NOx, SO2, and other emissions 
controls for the fleets of these major Eastern companies by specified dates. Many of the pollution controls are 
required between 2010 and 2015.

 These include current and future state programs in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, 
Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin the cover certain emissions from the power sector.

on all of these other legally binding and enforceable commitments for installation and operation 
of pollution controls.  This chapter focuses on results of EPA‘s analysis with IPM for the 
model‘s 2015 run-year in connection with the compliance date for the proposed Toxics Rule. 
The proposed Toxics Rule establishes National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (NESHAPS) for the ―electric utility steam generating unit‖ source category, which 
includes those units that combust coal or oil for the purpose of generating electricity for sale and 
distribution through the national electric grid to the public. 
Coal-fired electric utility steam generating units include electric utility steam generating 
units that burn coal, coal refuse, or a synthetic gas derived from coal either exclusively, in any 
combination together, or in any combination with other supplemental fuels.  Examples of 
supplemental fuels include petroleum coke and tire-derived fuels.  The NESHAP establishes 
standards for HAP emissions from both coal- and oil-fired EGUs and will apply to any existing, 
new, or reconstructed units located at major or area sources of HAP.  Although all HAP are 
pollutants of interest, those of particular concern are hydrogen fluoride (HF), hydrogen chloride 
(HCl), dioxins/furans, and HAP metals, including antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, 
chromium, cobalt, mercury, manganese, nickel, lead, and selenium. 
This rule affects any fossil fuel fired combustion unit of more than 25 megawatts electric 
(MWe) that serves a generator that produces electricity for sale.  A unit that cogenerates steam 
and electricity and supplies more than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more 
than 25 MWe output to any utility power distribution system for sale is also considered an 
electric utility steam generating unit.  The rule would affect roughly 1,400 coal and oil or gas 
fired steam units with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MW. 
Tables 8-1 and 8-2 show the control requirements of the Toxics Rule that EPA has 
analyzed in the RIA.  For further discussion about the scope and requirements of the Toxics 
Rule, see the Toxics Rule preamble or Chapter 2 of this RIA.

EPA used the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) v.4.10 to assess the impacts of the 
proposed emission limitations for coal-fired electricity generating units (EGU) in the contiguous 
United States.  IPM modeling did not subject oil-fired units to policy criteria.1 Furthermore, IPM 
modeling did not include generation outside the contiguous U.S., where EPA is aware of only 2 
facilities that would be subject to the coal-fired requirements of the proposed rule.  Given the 
limited number of potentially impacted facilities, limited availability of input data to inform the 
modeling, and limited connection to the continental grid, EPA did not model the impacts of the 
proposed rule beyond the contiguous U.S. 
Mercury emissions are modeled as a function of mercury content of the fuel type(s) 
consumed at each plant in concert with that plant‘s pollutant control configuration.  HCl 
emissions are projected in a similar fashion using the chlorine content of the fuel(s).  For both 
mercury and HCl, EGUs in the model must emit at or below the proposed mercury and HCl 
emission rate standards in order to operate from 2015 onwards.  EGUs may change fuels and/or 
install additional control technology to meet the standard, or they may choose to retire if it is 
more economic for the power sector to meet electricity demand with other sources of generation.  
See IPM documentation for more details. 
Total PM emissions are calculated exogenously, using EPA‘s Source Classification Code 
(SCC) and control-based emissions factors.  SCC is a classification system that describes a 
generating unit‘s characteristics.  In the policy case, EPA assumes that most coal- and solid-oil 
derived fuel-fired EGUs require a fabric filter (also known as a baghouse) to meet the total PM 
standard.

 EPA was not able to model the impacts of the proposed rule on oil-fired units.  EPA plans to include an analysis of 
impacts on oil-fired units for the final rule. 
 8-6 
Instead of emission limitations for the organic HAP, EPA is proposing that if requested, 
owners or operators of EGUs submit to the delegated authority or EPA, as appropriate, 
documentation showing that an annual performance test meeting the requirements of the 
proposed rule was conducted.  IPM modeling assumes compliance with these work practice 
standards. 
Electricity demand is anticipated to grow by roughly 1 percent per year, and total 
electricity demand is projected to be 4,104 billion kWh by 2015.  Table 8-3 shows current 
electricity generation alongside EPA‘s base case projection for 2015 generation using IPM.  
EPA‘s IPM modeling for this rule relies on EIA‘s Annual Energy Outlook for 2010‘s electric 
demand forecast for the US and employs a set of EPA assumptions regarding fuel supplies and 
the performance and cost of electric generation technologies as well as pollution controls.  The 
base case includes the proposed Transport Rule (which upon finalization will replace the Clean 
Air Interstate Rule currently in place) as well as other existing state and federal programs for 
emissions control from electric generating units.

fossil facilities in the NEEDS 4.10 IPM framework.  NEEDS reflects available capacity on-line by the end of 
2011; this includes committed new builds and committed retirements.  In areas with a dense concentration of 
facilities, some facilities may be obscured. 
As noted above, IPM has been used for evaluating the economic and emission impacts of 
environmental policies for over a decade.  The economic modeling presented in this chapter has 
been developed for specific analyses of the power sector.  Thus, the model has been designed to 
reflect the industry as accurately as possible.  To that end, EPA uses a series of capital charge 
factors in IPM that embody financial terms for the various types of investments that the power 
sector considers for meeting future generation and environmental constraints.  The model applies 
a discount rate of 6.15% for optimizing the sector‘s decision-making over time.  IPM‘s discount 
rate, designed to represent a broad range of private-sector decisions for power generation, rates 
differs from discount rates used in other analyses in this RIA, such as the benefits and 
macroeconomic analyses which each assume alternative social discount rates of 3% and 7%.  
EPA uses the best available information from utilities, financial institutions, debt rating agencies, 
and government statistics as the basis for the capital charge rates and the discount rate used for 
power sector modeling in IPM. 
More detail on IPM can be found in the model documentation, which provides additional 
information on the assumptions discussed here as well as all other assumptions and inputs to the 
 8-8 
model (http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm).  Updates specific to Toxics Rule 
modeling are also in the ―Documentation Supplement for EPA Base Case v.4.10_PTox – 
Updates for Proposed Toxics Rule.‖ 
8.2 Projected Emissions 
The proposed Toxics Rule is anticipated to achieve substantial emissions reductions.  
Since the technologies available to meet the emission reduction requirements of the rule reduce 
multiple air pollutants, EPA expects the proposed Toxics Rule to yield a broad array of pollutant 
reductions from the power sector.  The primary pollutants of concern under the proposed Toxics 
Rule from the power sector are mercury, acid gases such as hydrogen chloride (HCl), and HAP 
metals, including antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, mercury, 
manganese, nickel, lead, and selenium.  EPA has extensively analyzed mercury emissions from 
the power sector, and IPM modeling assesses the mercury contents in all coals and the removal 
efficiencies of relevant emission control technologies (e.g., ACI).  For the proposed Toxics Rule, 
EPA has included the ability to model emissions and the pollution control technologies 
associated with HCl (a proposed surrogate for acid gas emissions).  Like SO2, HCl is removed by 
both scrubbers and DSI, a control technology included in this updated version of the model.  In 
addition to a better representation of the pollution controls available to reduce HCl in IPM, the 
detailed coal supply curves used in the model have been updated to reflect the chlorine content of 
coals, which corresponds with the supply region, coal grade, and sulfur, mercury, and ash 
content of each coal type.  This information is critical for accurately projecting future HCl 
emissions, and for understanding how the power sector will respond to a policy requiring 
reductions of multiple HAPs. 
Generally, existing pollution control technologies reduce emissions across a range of 
pollutants.  For example, both FGD and SCR can achieve notable reductions in mercury in 
addition to their primary targets of SO2 and NOX reductions.  DSI will reduce HCl emissions 
while also yielding substantial SO2 emission reductions.  Since there are many avenues to reduce 
emissions, and because the power sector is a highly complex and dynamic industry, EPA 
employs IPM in order to reflect the relevant components of the power sector accurately, while 
also providing a sophisticated view of how the industry could respond to particular policies to 
reduce emissions.  For more detail on how EPA models emissions from the power sector, 
including recent updates to include acid gases, see ―Documentation Supplement for EPA Base 
Case v.4.10_PTox – Updates for Proposed Toxics Rule.‖ 
 8-9 
Under the proposed Toxics Rule, EPA projects annual HCl emissions reductions of 87 
percent in 2015, SO2 emission reductions of 53 percent, and annual NOx emissions reductions of 
7 percent from the power sector by 2015, relative to the base case.  In addition, EPA projects Hg 
emissions to be reduced by 67 percent relative to the base case (see Table 8-4).  Mercury 
emission projections in EPA‘s base case are affected by the incidental capture of mercury in 
other pollution control technologies (such as FGD and SCR) as described above.  The emission 
rate limitations for mercury in the proposed Toxics Rule would be the Clean Air Act‘s legal 
constraint on all possible mercury air emissions that could occur from the fuel combusted for 
power generation at the affected sources.  In this analysis, the mercury content of all of the coal 
burned at affected units in the base case would yield 75 tons of mercury emissions if no 
emissions were subsequently captured.  From this perspective, the emission rate limitations in 
the proposed Toxics Rule would assure a 91% reduction in air emissions of mercury from the 
coal-fired units subject to the policy.

*Note: For the purposes of the RIA, EPA modeled a case that included state mercury-specific regulations and 
voluntary ACI, which underestimates potential base case mercury emissions by an estimated 4.7 tons because EPA 
cannot rely on those mercury reductions to be permanent.  As a result of modeling this optimistic scenario, EPA has 
underestimated both costs and benefits; however, EPA does not expect that net benefits are likely to change 
significantly on the basis of these reductions.

8.3 Projected Compliance Costs 
The power industry‘s ―compliance costs‖ are represented in this analysis as the change in 
electric power generation costs between the base case and policy case in which the sector 
pursues pollution control approaches to meet the proposed Toxics Rule HAP emission standards.  
In simple terms, these costs are the resource costs of what the power industry will directly 
expend to comply with EPA‘s requirements. 
EPA projects that the annual incremental compliance cost of the proposed Toxics Rule is 
$10.9 billion in 2015 ($2007).  The annual incremental cost is the projected additional cost of 
complying with the proposed rule in the year analyzed, and includes the amortized cost of capital 
investment and the ongoing costs of operating additional pollution controls, needed new 
capacity, shifts between or amongst various fuels, and other actions associated with compliance.

Generation

Annualized Compliance Cost 
(billions of 2007$) 
$10.9 $10.1 $10.0 
Source: Integrated Planning Model run by EPA, 2011. 
EPA‘s projection of $10.9 billion in additional costs in 2015 should be put into context 
for power sector operations.  As shown in section 7.6, the power sector is expected in the base 
case to expend over $320 billion in 2015 to generate, transmit, and distribute electricity to end-
use consumers.  Therefore, the projected costs of compliance with the Toxics Rule amount to 
less than a 3.5% increase in the cost to meet electricity demand, while securing public health 
benefits that are several times more valuable (as described in Chapter 5). EPA plans to estimate 
the social cost for the final rule using a general equilibrium approach that incorporates the effect 
on electricity price change through the economy. 
8.4 Projected Compliance Actions for Emissions Reductions 
Fossil fuel-fired electric generating units are projected to achieve HAP emission 
reductions through a combination of compliance options.  These actions include improved 
operation of existing controls, additional pollution control installations, coal switching (including 
blending of coals), and generation shifts towards more efficient units and lower-emitting 
generation technologies (e.g., some reduction of coal-fired generation with an increase of 
 8-13 
generation from natural gas).  In addition, there will be some affected sources that find it 
uneconomic to invest in new pollution control equipment and will be removed from service.  
These facilities are generally amongst the oldest and least efficient power plants, and typically 
run infrequently.  In order to ensure that any retirements resulting from the proposed Toxics Rule 
do not adversely impact the ability of affected sources and electric utilities from meeting the 
demand for electricity, EPA has conducted an analysis of the impacts of projected retirements on 
electric reliability.  This analysis is discussed in TSD titled: ―Resource Adequacy and Reliability 
in the IPM Projections for the Toxics Rule‖ which is available in the docket. 
The requirements under the proposed Toxics Rule are largely met through the installation 
of pollution controls (see Figure 8-6).  To a lesser extent, there is a small degree of shifting 
within and across various ranks and types of coals, and a relatively small shift from coal-fired 
generation to greater use of natural gas and non-emitting sources of electricity (e.g., renewables 
and nuclear)  (see Table 8-6).  The largest share of emissions reductions occur from coal-fired 
units installing new pollution control devices, such as FGD, ACI, and fabric filters; a smaller 
share of emission reductions come from fuel shifts and unit retirements.  Mercury emission 
reductions are largely driven by SCR/FGD combinations and ACI installations.  HCl emission 
reductions are largely driven by FGD and DSI installations, which also incidentally provide 
substantial SO2 reductions in the policy case.  Mercury, PM2.5, and HCl emission reductions are 
also facilitated by the installation of fabric filters, which boost mercury and HCl removal 
efficiencies of ACI and DSI, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 8-6, this analysis projects that by 2015, the proposed Toxics Rule 
will drive the installation of an additional 24 GW of FGD (scrubbers), 56 GW of DSI, 93 GW of 
additional ACI, and 3 GW of SCR.  Additionally, EPA is assuming for the purposes of this 
analysis that a subset of all covered coal-fired EGUs will require a fabric filter in order to meet 
the total PM standard.  This assumption results in an additional 49 GW of fabric filter retrofits, 
for a total of 165 GW by 2015.  For more information, see section 8.14.

8.5 Projected Generation Mix 
Table 8-7and Figure 8-7 show the generation mix in the base case and in the proposed 
Toxics Rule policy case.  In 2015, coal-fired generation is projected to decline slightly and 
natural-gas-fired generation is projected to increase slightly relative to the base case.  Coal-fired 
generation is projected to increase above 2009 actual levels.  The vast majority (over 95%) of 
base case coal capacity is projected to remain in service under the proposed Toxics Rule.  In

8.6 Projected Retirements 
Relative to the base case, about 9.9 GW of coal-fired capacity is projected to be 
uneconomic to maintain (roughly 3 percent of all coal-fired capacity) by 2015.  Uneconomic 
units, for the most part, are older, smaller, and less frequently used generating units that are 
dispersed throughout the country (see Table 8-7 and Figure 8-8).  For the proposed Toxics Rule, 
EPA has examined whether these closures may adversely impact reserve margins and reliability 
planning.  The IPM model is specifically designed to ensure that generation resource availability 
is maintained in the projected results subject to reserve margins in 32 modeling regions for the 
contiguous US, which must be preserved either by using existing resources or through the 
construction of new resources.  IPM also addresses reliable delivery of generation resources by 
limiting the ability to transfer power between regions using the bulk power transmission system.  
Within each model region, IPM assumes that adequate transmission capacity is available to 
deliver any resources located in, or transferred to, the region.  The IPM model projects available 
capacity given certain constraints such as reserve margins and transmission capability but does 
not constitute a detailed reliability analysis.  For example, the IPM model does not examine 
frequency response.  For more detail on IPM‘s electric load modeling and power system 
operation, please see IPM documentation (http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-
ipm/index.html) and the TSD on Resource Adequacy and Reliability in the IPM Projections for 
the Toxics Rule.

Rule, 2015 
 
Total operational capacity is lower in the policy scenario, primarily as a result of 
increases in coal retirements.  Since most regions are projected to have excess capacity above 
their target reserve margins, most of these retirements are absorbed by a reduction in excess 
reserves.  Operational capacity changes from the base case in 2015 are shown in Table 8-9.

Note: ―Non-Hydro Renewables‖ include biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind electric generation capacity.  2015 
capacity reflects plant closures planned to occur prior to 2015. 
The policy case analyzed maintains resource adequacy in each region experiencing coal 
unit retirements by using excess reserve capacity within the region, reversing base case 
retirements of non-coal capacity, building new capacity, or by importing excess reserve capacity 
from other regions.  Although any closure of a large generation facility will need to be studied to 
determine potential local reliability concerns, EPA analysis suggests that projected retirements 
 8-19 
under the proposed Toxics Rule could have little to no overall impact on electric reliability.  Not 
only are projected retirements under the proposed Toxics Rule limited in scope, but the existing 
state of the power sector is also characterized by substantial excess capacity.  The weighted 
average reserve margin at the national level is projected to be approximately 25% in the base 
case, while the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) recommends a margin 
of 15%.  EPA projects that the proposed Toxics Rule would only reduce total operational 
capacity by less than one percent in 2015. 
Moreover, projected coal retirements are distributed throughout the power grid with 
limited effect at the regional level, such that any potential impacts should not adversely affect 
reserve margins and should be manageable through the normal industry processes.  For example, 
the coal-fired generating areas in western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana all 
have significant excess generation resources: these areas combined see a decrease of less than 
2% in their reserve margins in the policy case and retain an overall reserve margin of over 20%.  
Furthermore, subregions may share each other‘s excess reserves to ensure adequate reserve 
margins within a larger reliability region.  EPA‘s IPM modeling accommodates such transfers of 
reserves within the assumed limits of reliability of the inter-regional bulk power system.  For 
these reasons, the projected closures of coal plants are not expected to raise broad reliability 
concerns. 
8.7 Projected Capacity Additions 
Due in part to a low growth rate anticipated for future electricity demand levels in the 
latest EIA forecast, EPA analysis indicates that there is sufficient excess capacity through 2015 
to compensate for capacity that is retired from service under the proposed Toxics Rule.  In the 
short-term, most new capacity is projected as a mix of wind and natural gas in response to low 
fuel prices and other energy policies (such as tax credits and state renewable portfolio standards).  
In addition, future electricity demand expectations have trended downwards in recent forecasts, 
reducing the need for new capacity in the 2015 timeframe (see Chapter 7 for more discussion on 
future electricity demand).

8.8 Projected Coal Production for the Electric Power Sector 
Coal production for electricity generation under the proposed Toxics Rule is expected to 
decline modestly relative to the base case without the rule.  The reductions in emissions from the 
power sector will be met through the installation and operation of pollution controls for HAP 
removal.  Many available pollution controls achieve emissions removal rates of up to 99 percent 
(e.g., HCl removal by new scrubbers), which allows industry to rely more heavily on local 
bituminous coal in the eastern and central parts of the country that has higher contents of HCl 
and sulfur, and it is less expensive to transport than western subbituminous coal.  Generally, the 
demand for bituminous coals increases under the proposed rule, while demand for subbituminous 
and lignite coals is reduced slightly (see Tables 8-10 and 8-11).  The trend reflects the reduced 
demand for lower-sulfur coal under the proposed Toxics Rule, where nearly all units are 
operating with a post-combustion emissions control.  In this case, because of the additional 
pollution controls, many of these units no longer find it economic to pay a transportation 
premium to purchase lower-sulfur subbituminous coals.  Instead, EGUs are generally shifting 
consumption towards nearby bituminous coal, which can achieve low emissions when combined 
with post-combustion emissions controls.  This explains the increase in coal supplied from the 
Interior region, which is located in relatively close proximity to many coal-fired generators 
subject to this proposed rule.  The decline in lignite use reflects a decrease in generation from 
lignite-fired boilers, as well as a general shift toward subbituminous for boilers which were 
burning lignite coal in the base case.

Regional retail electricity prices are projected to range from 1 to 7 percent higher with the 
proposed Toxics Rule in 2015.  The extent of regional retail electricity increases correlates with 
states that have considerable coal-fired generation that is less well-controlled (such as in the 
ECAR, MAAC, and SPP regions).  EPA has not presented an analysis of the economy-wide 
impacts from projected electricity price changes but will consider doing so in the final rule.

Figure 8-10. Retail Price Model Regions 
 
8.10 Projected Fuel Price Impacts 
The impacts of the proposed Toxics Rule on coal and natural gas prices before shipment 
are shown below in Tables 8-14 and 8-15.  Overall, average coal price changes are related to 
changes in demand for a wide variety of coals based upon a number of parameters (e.g., chlorine 
or mercury content, heat content, proximity to the power plant, etc.).  Generally, the demand for 
bituminous coals increases under the proposed rule, while demand for subbituminous and lignite 
coals is reduced slightly.  This is reflected in the projected average minemouth price of coal, 
which goes up slightly (about 1 percent) even though total demand for coal is reduced slightly (1 
percent reduction).  Notwithstanding the projected ―mine-mouth‖ coal price changes, many units 
may in fact be realizing overall fuel cost savings by switching to more local coal supplies (which 
reduces transportation costs) after installing additional pollution control equipment.  Gas price 
changes are directly related the projected increase in natural gas consumption under the proposed 
rule.  This increase in demand is met by producing additional natural gas at some increase in 
regional costs, resulting over time in a small price increase. 
IPM modeling of natural gas prices uses both short- and long-term price signals to 
balance supply of and demand in competitive markets for the fuel across the modeled time 
horizon.  As such, it should be understood that the pattern of IPM natural gas price projections 
over time is not a forecast of natural gas prices incurred by end-use consumers at any particular 
point in time.  The natural gas market in the United States has historically experienced 
significant price volatility from year to year, between seasons within a year, and even sees major 
price swings during short-lived weather events (such as cold snaps leading to short-run spikes in 
 8-24 
heating demand).  These short-term price signals are fundamental for allowing the market to 
successfully align immediate supply and demand needs; however, end-use consumers are 
typically shielded from experiencing these rapid fluctuations in natural gas prices by retail rate 
regulation and by hedging through longer-term fuel supply contracts.  IPM assumes these longer-
term price arrangements take place ―outside of the model‖ and on top of the ―real-time‖ shorter-
term price variation necessary to align supply and demand.  Therefore, the model‘s natural gas 
price projections should not be mistaken for traditionally experienced consumer price impacts 
related to natural gas, but a reflection of expected average price changes over the time period 
2015 to 2030. 
For this analysis, in order to represent a natural gas price evolution that end-use 
consumers can anticipate under retail rate regulation and/or typical hedging behavior, EPA is 
displaying the weighted average of IPM‘s natural gas price projections for the 2015-2030 time 
horizon (see Table 8-15).  In that framework, consumer natural gas price impacts are anticipated 
to range from 0.6% to 1.3% based on consumer class in response to the proposed Toxics Rule. 
EPA has not presented an analysis of the economy-wide impacts from projected fuel price 
changes but will consider doing so in the final rule.

8.11 Key Differences in EPA Model Runs for the Toxics Rule Modeling 
The 2015 base case EGU emissions projections of mercury, hydrogen chloride, SO2, and 
PM were obtained from an interim version 4.10 of the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) 
(http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/epa-ipm/index.html).  The IPM is a multiregional, 
dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector.  Version 
4.10 reflects state rules and consent decrees through December 1, 2010, and incorporates 
information on existing controls collected through the Utility MACT ICR.  Units with SO2 or 
NOX advanced controls (e.g., scrubber, SCR) that were not required to run for compliance with 
Title IV, New Source Review (NSR), state settlements, or state-specific rules were allowed in 
IPM to decide on the basis of economic efficiency whether to operate those controls. Units with 
advanced mercury controls (e.g., ACI) were assumed to operate those controls in states with 
mercury requirements.  Note that this base case includes the proposed Transport Rule, which will 
be finalized in June, 2011.  Further details on the EGU emissions inventory used for this 
proposal can be found in the IPM Documentation. 
The length of time required to conduct emissions and photochemical modeling precluded 
the use of IPM version 4.10_PTox (Proposed Toxics Rule).  Thus the air quality modeling for the 
Toxics Rule relied on EGU emission projections from an interim IPM platform that was 
subsequently updated during the rulemaking process for the scenario summarized in this chapter.  
The IPM update reflects additional information obtained primarily from the 2010 ICR and from 
comments submitted on an IPM Notice of Data Availability (NODA) in October 2010.  Notably, 
this IPM update included the addition of over 20 GW of existing ACI reported to EPA via the 
ICR, which explains the majority of the difference in interim and final base case EGU mercury 
projections.  This update also includes additional unit-level updates that were made based on the 
ICR and public comments on the IPM NODA which identified additional existing pollution 
controls which affect base case projections of multiple pollutants, including mercury emissions 
 8-26 
incidentally captured through operation of post-combustion controls (such as scrubbers).  
Additionally, the IPM update corrected an erroneous natural gas PM2.5 emission factor from the 
interim platform which overestimated EGU PM2.5 emissions by about 85,000 tons.  Other 
updates includes adjustments to assumptions regarding the cost and performance of acid gas 
control technologies, a correction to mercury removal from new fabric filters, new costs imposed 
on fuel-switching (e.g., bituminous to subbituminous), correction of lignite availability to some 
plants, incorporation of additional planned retirements, a more inclusive implementation of the 
scrubber upgrade option, and the availability of a scrubber retrofit to waste coal-fired fluidized 
bed combustion units without an existing scrubber. 
The interim policy case modeling of EGU emissions for air quality modeling, presented 
in Chapter 3, was conducted before EPA completed a comprehensive review of ICR data to 
inform the proposed Toxics Rule emissions limits.  This interim policy case reflected more 
stringent HCl and mercury emission reduction requirements than are being proposed in today‘s 
action. 
8.12 Projected Primary PM Emissions from Power Plants 
IPM does not endogenously model primary PM emissions from power plants.  These 
emissions are calculated as a function of IPM outputs, emission factors and control 
configuration.  IPM-projected fuel use (heat input) is multiplied by PM emission factors (based 
in part on the presence of PM-relevant pollution control devices) to determine PM emissions.  
Primary PM emissions are calculated by adding the filterable PM and condensable PM 
emissions. 
Filterable PM emissions for each unit are based on historical information regarding 
existing emissions controls and types of fuel burned and ash content of the fuel burned, as well 
as the projected emission controls (e.g., scrubbers and fabric filters). 
Condensable PM emissions are based on plant type, sulfur content of the fuel, and 
SO2/HCl and PM control configurations.  Although EPA‘s analysis is based on the best available 
emission factors, these emission factors do not account for the potential changes in condensable 
PM emissions due to the installation and operation of SCRs.  The formation of additional 
condensable PM (in the form of SO3 and H2SO4) in units with SCRs depends on a number of 
factors, including coal sulfur content, combustion conditions and characteristics of the catalyst 
used in the SCR, and is likely to vary widely from unit to unit.  SCRs are generally designed and 
operated to minimize increases in condensable PM.  This limitation means that IPM post-
processing is potentially underestimating condensable PM emissions for units with SCRs.  In 
 8-27 
contrast, it is possible that IPM post-processing overestimates condensable PM emissions in a 
case where the unit is combusting a low-sulfur coal in the presence of a scrubber. 
EPA plans to continue improving and updating the PM emission factors and calculation 
methodologies.  For a more complete description of the methodologies used to post-process PM 
emissions from IPM, see ―IPM ORL File Generation Methodology‖ (March, 2011). 
8.13 Illustrative End-use Energy Efficiency Policy Sensitivity 
To explore the possible impacts of this rule under an alternative baseline with increased 
federal and state energy efficiency policies and resultant lower levels of electricity generation, 
EPA developed an end-use energy efficiency policy scenario and analyzed the associated effects.  
By reducing electricity demand, energy efficiency avoids emissions of all pollutants associated 
with electricity generation, including emissions of toxic air pollutants targeted by this rule.  This 
―energy efficiency sensitivity‖ illustrates a possible alternative future where use of energy 
efficiency policies lead to increased investment in cost-effective energy end-use technologies 
beyond what is reflected in the reference electricity demand forecast used for EPA‘s core 
analysis (i.e., the analysis described in the preceding subsections of this chapter).  This 
sensitivity does not represent an EPA forecast of electricity demand. 
EPA based the energy efficiency sensitivity on two policies:  implementation of federal 
appliance standards for products required under existing statutes and the possible increased use 
of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs consistent with recent state policy trends.  The 
projected electricity demand impacts of the federal appliance standards were provided by the 
U.S. Department of Energy‘s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and are 
an estimate of the incremental effects, relative to the AEO 2010 reference case forecast, of 
DOE‘s statutorily mandated appliance standards rulemakings (appliance standards that have been 
implemented are in the base case).  The projected electricity demand impacts of the increased use 
of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs are derived from a 2009 analysis by the 
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL).1  For both of these energy efficiency policies (federal 
appliance standards and ratepayer-funded energy efficiency), EPA assumed the continued use of 
the policies at similar levels of effectiveness, and estimated the associated impacts, through 2050 
(the final year for EPA‘s regulatory analysis. 
After developing the basis for the energy efficiency sensitivity, EPA derived annual 
electricity demand impacts, estimated associated costs, and analyzed impacts on the electricity

generation sector.  The total U.S. electricity demand reductions in 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 
2050, for the energy efficiency scenario represent 2.9%, 5.3%, 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.8% of U.S. 
electricity demand in those years, respectively.  These reductions lower annual average 
electricity demand growth (from 2009 historic data) through 2020 from the reference forecast 
from 1.04% to 0.55%.  Similarly, through 2030 the reduction is from 0.97% to 0.64%, and 
through 2050 the reduction is from 0.91% to 0.77%.  These reductions in demand growth are 
substantially lower than recent estimates of available, cost-effective energy efficiency potential.  
Costs associated with the two policy strategies were estimated based upon historical studies 
specific to each policy.  For more information on the construction of the EE sensitivity, see 
Appendix D. 
EPA analyzed the impacts of the energy efficiency sensitivity on the electricity 
generation sector by conducting alternative scenarios using the Integrated Planning Model.  The 
results from those modeling runs and the associated costs are summarized in Tables 8-16, 8-17, 
and 8-18.1 
The effects of the Toxics Rule under the Energy Efficiency Scenario on total electricity 
generating costs of the power sector are shown below in Table 8-16.  In this table we also see the 
projected costs in the Base and Toxics Rule Cases with and without energy efficiency.  In this 
analysis, the costs of additional energy efficiency investments to ratepayers and consumers are 
treated as a component of the cost of generating electricity and are imbedded in the costs seen in 
this table.  Under the Energy Efficiency Scenario, the incremental costs of the Toxics Rule are 
moderately reduced in 2015, 2020, and 2030, by $0.3 billion, $1.1 billion, and $0.8 billion, 
respectively. When comparing the Toxics Rule Case without energy efficiency to the Toxics 
Rule Case with energy efficiency, the analysis suggests that these energy efficiency policies 
could mitigate the cost of the Toxics Rule such that the overall system costs are reduced by $2.3 
billion in 2015, $6.0 billion in 2020, and $11.4 billion in 2030.

 EPA‘s analysis may not capture the full spectrum of behavior effects associated with energy efficiency policies 
that can mitigate projected reductions in energy demand.  These effects can include: 
―rebound effect‖ (increased use of energy efficient product as a result of perceived energy savings, increased 
consumption of other energy consuming products -- from disposable income freed up by energy savings, 
increased production that might occur as a result of cost savings from energy efficient technologies, or changes 
in energy efficient product utility that lead to increased use).  This analysis does, however, account for many of 
these effects in the estimation of the energy demand reductions associated with the federal appliance standards 
for products.

The effects of the Toxics Rule under the Energy Efficiency Scenario on retail electricity 
prices for the continental U.S. are shown in Table 8-17.  In this table we also see the projected 
retail electricity prices in the Base and Toxics Rule Cases with and without energy efficiency.  
The costs of the energy efficiency investments that would be borne by ratepayers are included in 
these retail electricity prices for the energy efficiency cases.  Under the Energy Efficiency 
Scenario, the incremental impacts of the Toxics Rule on retail electricity prices are to increase 
them in 2015, 2020, and 2030, by 0.36 cents/KWh, 0.26 cents/KWh , and 0.21 cents/KWh, 
respectively. When comparing the Toxics Rule Case without energy efficiency to the Toxics 
Rule Case with energy efficiency, the analysis suggests that these energy efficiency policies 
could mitigate the impacts of the Toxics Rule such that the retail electricity prices are reduced by 
0.04 cents/KWh in 2015, 0.38 cents/KWh in 2020, and 0.42 cents/KWh in 2030.

The effects of the Toxics Rule under the Energy Efficiency Scenario on new capacity 
additions are shown in Table 8-18.  Under the Energy Efficiency Scenario, the incremental 
impacts of the Toxics Rule on new capacity additions are to increase them in 2015, 2020, and 
2030, by 0.1 GW, 0.2 GW, and 5.1 GW, respectively. When comparing the Toxics Rule Case 
without energy efficiency to the Toxics Rule Case with energy efficiency, the analysis suggests 
that these energy efficiency policies reduce the need for new capacity by 0.3 GW in 2015, 8.5 
GW in 2020, and 39.8 GW in 2030.

scenario, and an  expanded set of IPM results for the scenario, including costs, energy prices, 
retirements, emission controls, and air emissions, see Appendix D. 
8.14 Limitations of Analysis 
EPA‘s modeling is based on expert judgment of various input assumptions for variables 
whose outcomes are in fact uncertain.  Assumptions for future fuel supplies and electricity 
demand growth deserve particular attention because of the importance of these two key model 
inputs to the power sector.  As a general matter, the Agency reviews the best available 
information from engineering studies of air pollution controls to support a reasonable modeling 
framework for analyzing the cost, emission changes, and other impacts of regulatory actions. 
The annualized cost estimates of private compliance costs provided in this analysis are 
meant to show the increase in production (generating) costs to the power sector in response to the 
proposed Toxics Rule.  To estimate these annualized costs, EPA uses a conventional and widely-
accepted approach that applies a capital recovery factor (CRF) multiplier to capital investments 
and adds that to the annual incremental operating expenses.  The CRF is derived from estimates 
of the cost of capital (private discount rate), the amount of insurance coverage required, local 
property taxes, and the life of capital.  The private compliance costs presented earlier are EPA‘s 
best estimate of the direct private compliance costs of the Proposed Toxics Rule. 
 8-32 
The annualized cost of the proposed Toxics Rule, as quantified here, is EPA‘s best 
assessment of the cost of implementing the rule.  These costs are generated from rigorous 
economic modeling of changes in the power sector due to the proposed Toxics Rule.  This type 
of analysis using IPM has undergone peer review, and federal courts have upheld regulations 
covering the power sector that have relied on IPM‘s cost analysis. 
The direct private compliance cost includes, but is not limited to, capital investments in 
pollution controls, operating expenses of the pollution controls, investments in new generating 
sources, and additional fuel expenditures.  EPA believes that the cost assumptions used for the 
proposed Toxics Rule reflect, as closely as possible, the best information available to the Agency 
today.  The relatively small cost associated with monitoring emissions, reporting, and record 
keeping for affected sources is not included in these annualized cost estimates, but EPA has done 
a separate analysis and estimated the cost to be approximately $49 million annually (see Section 
10.3, Paperwork Reduction Act). 
Cost estimates for the proposed Toxics Rule are based on results from ICF‘s Integrated 
Planning Model.  The model minimizes the costs of producing electricity (including abatement 
costs) while meeting load demand and other constraints (full documentation for IPM can be 
found at http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm and in the ―Documentation 
Supplement for EPA Base Case v.4.10_PTox – Updates for Proposed Toxics Rule.‖.  IPM 
assumes ―perfect foresight‖ of market conditions over the time horizon modeled; to the extent 
that utilities and/or energy regulators misjudge future conditions affecting the economics of 
pollution control, costs may be understated as well. 
In the policy case modeling, EPA assumes that a subset of covered units might require a 
retrofit fabric filter (also known as a baghouse) in order to meet at least one of the proposed 
emissions standards.  Based on ICR data and existing pollution controls, EPA estimates that 
approximately 54 GW of existing capacity without fabric filters may not require this retrofit for 
compliance with any of the proposed Toxics Rule emissions standards.  It is possible that this 
assumption is conservative, and that more EGUs may be able to comply with the proposed 
Toxics Rule standards without constructing a new fabric filter. 
Additionally, this modeling analysis does not take into account the potential for 
advancements in the capabilities of pollution control technologies as well as reductions in their 
costs over time.  In addition, EPA modeling cannot anticipate in advance the full spectrum of 
compliance strategies that the power sector may innovate to achieve the required emission 
reductions under the proposed Toxics Rule, which would potentially reduce overall compliance 
 8-33 
costs.  Where possible, EPA designs regulations to assure environmental performance while 
preserving flexibility for affected sources to design their own solutions for compliance.  Industry 
will employ an array of responses, some of which regulators may not fully anticipate and will 
generally lead to lower costs associated with the rule than modeled in this analysis.  For example, 
unit operators may find opportunities to improve or upgrade existing pollution control equipment 
without requiring as many new retrofit devices (i.e., meeting the PM standard with an existing 
ESP without requiring installation of a new fabric filter).  With that in mind, the Toxics Rule 
establishes emission rates on key HAPs, and although this analysis projects a specific set of 
technologies and behaviors as EPA‘s judgment of least-cost compliance, the power sector is free 
to adopt alternative technologies and behaviors to achieve the same environmental outcome EPA 
has deemed in the public interest as laid out in the Clean Air Act.  Such regulation serves to 
promote innovation and the development of new and cheaper technologies.  As an example, cost 
estimates of the Acid Rain SO2 trading program by Resources for the Future (RFF) and MIT‘s 
Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR) have been as much as 83 
percent lower than originally projected by the EPA (see Carlson et al., 2000; Ellerman, 2003).  It 
is important to note that the original analysis for the Acid Rain Program done by EPA also relied 
on an optimization model like IPM.  Ex ante, EPA cost estimates of roughly $2.7 to $6.2 billion1 
in 1989 were an overestimate of the costs of the program in part because of the limitation of 
economic modeling to perfectly anticipate technological improvement of pollution controls and 
economic improvement of other compliance options such as fuel switching.  Ex post estimates of 
the annual cost of the Acid Rain SO2 trading program range from $1.0 to $1.4 billion. 
In recognition of this historic pattern of overestimated regulatory cost, EPA‘s mobile 
source program uses adjusted engineering cost estimates of pollution control equipment and 
installation costs.2  To date, and including this analysis, EPA has not incorporated a similar 
approach into IPM modeling of EGU compliance with environmental constraints.  As a result, 
this analysis may overstate costs where such cost savings from as-yet untapped improvements to 
pollution control technologies may occur in the future.  Considering the broad and complex suite 
of generating technologies, fuels, and pollution control strategies available to the power sector, 
as well as the fundamental role of operating cost in electricity dispatch, it is not possible to apply 
a single technology-improving ―discount‖ transformation to the cost projections in this analysis.  
The Agency will consider additional methodologies in the future which may inform the amount

Vehicle Rules (2000).

by which projected compliance costs could be overstated regarding further technological 
development in analyses of power sector regulations. 
EPA‘s latest update of IPM incorporates state rules or regulations and various NSR 
settlements adopted through December of 2010.  Documentation for IPM can be found at 
http://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/progsregs/epa-ipm and in the TSD ―Updates to EPA Base Case 
v.4.10 Using the Integrated Planning Model.‖ 
As configured in this application, IPM does not take into account demand response (i.e., 
consumer reaction to electricity prices).  The increased retail electricity prices shown in Table 8-
13 would prompt end users to increase investment in energy efficiency and/or curtail (to some 
extent) their use of electricity and encourage them to use substitutes.1  Those responses would 
lessen the demand for electricity, resulting in electricity price increases slightly lower than IPM 
predicts, which would also reduce generation and emissions.  Demand response would yield 
certain unquantified cost savings from requiring less electricity to meet the quantity demanded.  
To some degree, these saved resource costs will offset the additional costs of pollution controls 
and fuel switching that EPA anticipates from the proposed Toxics Rule.  Although the reduction 
in electricity use is likely to be small, the cost savings from such a large industry2 are not 
insignificant.  EIA analysis examining multi-pollutant legislation in 2003 indicated that the 
annualized costs of the Toxics Rule may be overstated substantially by not considering demand 
response, depending on the magnitude and coverage of the price increases.3 
EPA‘s IPM modeling of the proposed Toxics Rule reflects the Agency‘s authority to 
allow facility-level compliance with the HAP emission standards rather than require each 
affected unit at a given facility to meet the standards separately.  This flexibility would offer 
important cost savings to facility owners in situations where a subset of affected units at a given 
facility could be controlled more cost-effectively such that their ―overperformance‖ would 
compensate for any ―underperformance‖ of the rest of the affected units.  EPA‘s modeling in this 
analysis required the average emission rate across all affected units at a given facility to meet the 
standard.  This averaging flexibility has the potential to offer further cost savings beyond this

nationwide cap and trade program for SO2, NOX, and mercury), demand response could lower present value costs 
by as much as 47% below what it would have been without an emission constraint similar to the Transport Rule.

analysis if particular units find ways to achieve superior pollution control beyond EPA‘s 
assumptions of retrofit technology performance at the modeled costs (which could then reduce 
the need to control other units at the same facility). 
Additionally, EPA has chosen to express most of the control requirements here as 
engineering performance standards (e.g., lbs/MMBtu of heat input), which provide power plant 
operators goals to meet as they see fit in choosing coals with various pollutant concentrations 
and pollutant control technologies that they adopt to meet the requirements.  Historically, such an 
approach encourages industry to engineer cheaper solutions over time to achieve the pollution 
controls requirements. 
EPA‘s IPM modeling is based on retrofit technology cost assumptions which reflect the 
best available information on current and foreseeable market conditions for pollution control 
deployment.  In the current economic environment, EPA does not anticipate (and thus this 
analysis does not reflect) significant near-term price increases in retrofit pollution control supply 
chains in response to the proposed Toxics Rule.  To the extent that such conditions may develop 
during the sector‘s installation of pollution control technologies under the proposed Toxics Rule, 
this analysis may understate the cost of compliance. 
8.15 Significant Energy Impact 
The Proposed Toxics Rule would have a significant impact according to E.O. 13211: 
Actions that Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use.  Under the provisions of 
this proposed rule, EPA projects that approximately 9.9 GW of coal-fired generation (roughly 3 
percent of all coal-fired capacity and 1% of total generation capacity in 2015) may be removed 
from operation by 2015.  These units are predominantly smaller and less frequently-used 
generating units dispersed throughout the area affected by the rule.  If current forecasts of either 
natural gas prices or electricity demand were revised in the future to be higher, that would create 
a greater incentive to keep these units operational. 
EPA also projects fuel price increases resulting from the proposed Toxics Rule.  Average 
retail electricity price are shown to increase in the contiguous U.S. by 3.7 percent in 2015.  This 
is generally less of an increase than often occurs with fluctuating fuel prices and other market 
factors.  Related to this, the average delivered coal price increases by less than 1 percent in 2015 
as a result of shifts within and across coal types.  As discussed above in section 8.10, EPA also 
projects that electric power sector-delivered natural gas prices will increase by about 1.3% 
percent over the 2015-2030 timeframe and that natural gas use for electricity generation will 
increase by less than 300 billion cubic feet (BCF) over that horizon.  These impacts are well 
 8-36 
within the range of price variability that is regularly experienced in natural gas markets.  Finally, 
the EPA projects coal production for use by the power sector, a large component of total coal 
production, will decrease by 20 million tons in 2015 from base case levels, which is less than 2 
percent of total coal produced for the electric power sector in that year.  The EPA does not 
believe that this rule will have any other impacts (e.g., on oil markets) that exceed the 
significance criteria.

APPENDIX D.  
ILLUSTRATIVE END-USE ENERGY EFFICIENCY POLICY SENSITIVITY 
This appendix summarizes the approach taken to define and analyze an illustrative energy 
efficiency policy sensitivity (―energy efficiency sensitivity‖), and presents the results of the 
analysis.  This appendix provides the basis for the discussion of the energy efficiency sensitivity 
provided in the rule preamble (Section M) and the RIA (Section 8.13).  For completeness some 
discussion is repeated from Section 8.13. 
D.1 Basis for the Energy Efficiency Sensitivity, Electricity Demand Impacts, and 
Associated Energy Efficiency-related Costs 
To explore the possible impacts of this rule under an alternative baseline with increased 
federal and state energy efficiency policies and resultant lower levels of electricity generation, 
EPA developed an illustrative end-use energy efficiency policy scenario and analyzed the 
associated effects.  By possibly reducing electricity demand, this illustrative energy efficiency 
scenario avoids emissions of all pollutants associated with electricity generation, including 
emissions of toxic air pollutants targeted by this rule.  This energy efficiency sensitivity 
illustrates a possible alternative future where increased use of well designed and implemented 
energy efficiency policies lead to increased investment in cost-effective energy end-use 
technologies beyond what is reflected in the reference electricity demand forecast used for 
EPA‘s core analysis.  This sensitivity does not represent an EPA forecast of electricity demand. 
EPA based the energy efficiency sensitivity on two policies:  implementation of federal 
appliance standards for products required under existing statutes and the increased possible use 
of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs consistent with recent state policy trends.  The 
projected electricity demand impacts of the federal appliance standards were provided by the 
U.S. Department of Energy‘s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and are 
an estimate of the incremental effects, relative to the AEO 2010 reference case forecast, of 
DOE‘s statutorily mandated appliance standards rulemakings (appliance standards that have been 
implemented are in the base case).  The projected electricity demand impacts of the increased use 
of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs are derived from a 2009 analysis by the 
Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL).1  For both policy approaches (federal appliance 
standards and ratepayer-funded energy efficiency), EPA assumed the continued use of the 
policies at similar levels of effectiveness, and estimated the associated impacts, through 2050

(the final year for EPA‘s regulatory analysis), which is beyond the timeframes of DOE‘s and 
LBNL‘s analyses (2035 and 2020, respectively). 
After developing the basis for the energy efficiency sensitivity, EPA derived annual 
electricity demand impacts, estimated associated costs, and analyzed impacts on the electricity 
generation sector.  The projected electricity impacts are summarized in Table D-1 and 
information is provided to put these reductions in context relative to the reference case forecast.  
The total U.S. electricity demand reductions in 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050, for the energy 
efficiency scenario represent 2.9%, 5.3%, 6.6%, 6.1% and 5.8% of U.S. electricity demand in 
those years, respectively.  These reductions lower annual average electricity demand growth 
(from 2009 historic data) through 2020 from the reference forecast from 1.04% to 0.55%.  
Similarly, through 2030 the reduction is from 0.97% to 0.64%, and through 2050 the reduction is 
from 0.91% to 0.77%.  These reductions are substantially less than recent estimates of available, 
cost-effective energy efficiency potential1.

Costs associated with the two policy strategies discussed above were estimated based 
upon historical studies specific to each policy.  For the electricity savings resulting from federal 
appliance standards a ―cost of saved energy‖ of $33.70/MWh (2007$) is used based on a study 
by Resources for the Future.1  This figure represents the costs associated with energy savings 
resulting from federally mandated appliance standards and is based upon their analysis of 
historical data.  These costs are borne by appliance manufacturers to produce products meeting 
the mandated energy standards and may be reflected in prices for those products paid by 
consumers.  For the electricity savings resulting from ratepayer-funded energy efficiency 
programs, a value of $46/MWh for the cost of saved energy is used based upon a national survey

D.2 Application within IPM and Summary Results 
The annual estimated electricity demand impacts for the energy efficiency sensitivity 
were used to develop two additional IPM runs, one using the adjusted demand within the EPA 
base case and the other using the adjusted demand within the EPA Toxics Rule case.  The results 
from these runs are summarized in Tables D-2 through D-11 and show the effects of the energy 
efficiency sensitivity on the following key outputs:  total costs (Table D-2), retail electricity 
prices (Table D-3), required new generation capacity (Table D-4), CO2 emissions (Table D-5), 
SO2 emissions (Table D-6), NOx emissions (Table D-7), Hg emissions (Table D-8), total 
retirements (Table D-9), coal retirements (Table D-10), and required FGD retrofits (Table D-11).  
Tables D-2 and D-3 reflect the estimated costs associated with energy efficiency policies as 
discussed above.

ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS 
9.1 Partial Equilibrium Analysis (Multiple Markets) 
Our partial equilibrium analysis uses a market model that simulates how stakeholders 
(consumers and industries) might respond to the additional regulatory program costs. In this 
section, we provide an overview of the economic model and the results for a short-run economic 
impact analysis (in this case, for 2016, the analysis year for this RIA).  More details on the 
economic model, the results, and data used by the model can be found in Appendix E. 
9.1.1 Overview 
Although several tools are available to estimate social costs, current EPA guidelines 
suggest that multimarket models ―…are best used when potential impacts on related markets 
might be considerable‖ and modeling using a computable general equilibrium model is not 
available or practical (EPA, 2010, p. 9-21). Other guides for environmental economists offer 
similar advice (Berck and Hoffmann, 2002; Just, Hueth, and Schmitz, 2004). Multimarket 
models focus on ―short-run‖ time horizons and measure a policy‘s near-term or transition costs 
(EPA, 1999). Our multimarket model contains the following features: 
 Industry sectors and benchmark data set 
– 100 industry sectors 
– multiple benchmark years 
 Economic behavior 
– industries respond to regulatory costs by changing production rates 
– market prices rise and fall to reflect higher energy and other non-energy material 
costs and changes in demand 
– customers respond to price increases and consumption falls 
 Model scope 
– 100 sectors are linked with each other based on their use of energy and other non-
energy materials. For example, the construction industry is linked with the 
petroleum, cement, and steel industries and is influenced by price changes that 
occur in each sector. The links allow EPA to account for indirect effects the 
regulation has on related markets. 
– production adjustments influence employment levels 
– international trade (imports/exports) responds to domestic price changes 
 9-2 
 Model time horizon (―short run‖) for a single period (2015)1 
– fixed production resources (e.g., capital) lead to an upward-sloping industry 
supply function 
– firms cannot alter certain input mixes; there is no substitution among intermediate 
production inputs 
– there is no explicit labor market (a real wage and labor supply is not determined 
within the model) 
– investment and government expenditures are fixed. 
Although the model is intended to examine transition or short-term effects of this 
rulemaking, the results may be muted due to the use of annualized capital cost as 
an input to the model rather than the total capital cost. 
9.1.2 Economic Impact Analysis Results 
Market-Level Results 
Market-level impacts include price and quantity adjustments including the changes in 
international trade (Table 9-1). Under the Toxics rule, the Agency‘s economic model suggests 
the average national price increase for energy is 0.8%.  Higher energy costs result in subsequent 
manufacturing sector price increases nationwide of 0.1% or less.  Imports also slightly rise 
because of higher U.S. prices. The one exception is transportation services; since sectors using 
transportation services are producing less, the demand for transportation services declines.  The 
size of the transportation services demand shift outweighs any supply side cost increases that 
place upward pressure on service prices (e.g. higher electricity and refined petroleum prices).  As 
a result, the average transportation services price falls. 
Social Cost Estimates Toxics Rule 
In the short run, the Agency‘s partial equilibrium multi-market model suggests that 
industries are able to pass on $8.4 billion (2007$) of the Toxic Rule‘s costs to U.S. households in 
the form of higher prices (Table 9-2). Existing U.S. industries‘ surplus falls by $2.6 billion and 
the net U.S. loss in aggregate, is $11.0 billion (2007$).  This is slightly higher than the 
annualized nationwide compliance cost estimate of the proposal as shown in Chapter 8 of the 
RIA because it excludes gains to other countries discussed below.

 For this analysis, we use 2015 as our analysis year and as a proxy for 2016.  This allows us to maintain consistency 
with the results of the analysis using IPM (found in Chapter 8) that serve as inputs to this economic impact 
analysis.

Note:  Approximated using the IPM cost analysis. For example, with the $11 billion increase in compliance costs for 
the electric power sector, IPM projects a 3.77 percent increase in the retail price of electricity.  All other energy 
market-level changes are determined within the multimarket model.  Appendix F provides additional details. 
As U.S. prices rise, other countries are affected through international trade relationships. 
The price of goods produced in the United States increase, domestic exports decline, and 
domestic production is replaced to a certain degree by imports; the model estimates a net gain of 
about $0.1 billion for other countries. The net change in total surplus is lower than the annualized 
nationwide compliance cost estimate of the proposal as shown in Chapter 8 of the RIA. Our 
estimate of social costs for the proposal incorporates the net change in total surplus, and this 
estimate is $10.9 billion (2007 dollars) as shown in Table 9-2, or nearly identical to the 
compliance costs.2  Compliance costs based on the pre-policy output levels would be overstated 
if we do not consider the new lower levels of consumption as a result of higher market prices.3

 The same is true for many recent rulemakings, including the Boiler MACT. 
3
 There are small additional losses associated with the foregone benefits associated with reduced consumption (e.g. 
deadweight loss).  However, in a perfectly competitive market without pre-existing distortions, the costs 
represent only a small fraction of total social costs.  A more detail discussion of the economic costs of regulation 
are discussed in Chapter 8 of EPA (2010).

Net change in Total Surplus  −$10.9 
 
As shown in Figure 9-1, the surplus losses are concentrated in the electric generation 
sector (45.4 percent) and other services (29.9 percent).  Other services include information, 
finance and insurance, real estate, professional services, management, administrative services, 
education, health care, arts, accommodations, and public services.  Although electricity costs 
represent a small share of total service industry production costs, the service sectors represent a 
significant economic sector within the U.S. economy and use a large amount of electricity.  The 
transition or short-term evaluation using a partial equilibrium model does not allow for resources 
to be allocated according to price changes.  So the results of the model does not capture any 
distortions in the economy that may results as the price of electricity changes.  If the distortions 
are significant, the ―true‖ social cost would be higher than the compliance cost and the results of 
this partial equilibrium model.

9.1.3 Alternative Approach to Estimating Social Cost 
In the Transport Rule proposed last summer, EPA used a different model to estimate the 
social cost of the regulatory approach than applied in this RIA.  That model, EPA‘s Economic 
Model for Policy Analysis (EMPAX), is a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) which 
dynamically cascades the cost of a regulation through the entire economy.  However, since that 
rule was proposed, an updated version of EMPAX was used to estimate the social cost of the 
Clean Air Act in a new EPA report entitled ―The Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act from 
1990 to 2020. This report is available at http://www.epa.gov/air/sect812/feb11/fullreport.pdf. 
This updated version of EMPAX added in the benefit-side effects (incorporating labor-
force and health care expenditures) which significantly changed the social cost estimate from the 
previous edition.  In December 2010, EPA‘s Science Advisory Board (SAB) found that  ―The 
inclusion of benefit-side effects (reductions in mortality, morbidity, and health-care 
expenditures) in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model represents a significant step 
forward in benefit-cost analysis.‖ 
http://yosemite.epa.gov/sab/sabproduct.nsf/1E6218DE3BFF682E852577FB005D46F1/$File/EP
A-COUNCIL-11-001-unsigned.pdf.  A description of the changes to the model and implications 
are covered in detail in chapter 8 of the section 812 report.  EPA has determined that it needs to 
update the EMPAX model version used for RIAs to add this benefit-side effect prior to use in 
any additional regulatory analysis.  EPA plans to use the updated version of EMPAX for the 
final RIA. 
9.2 Employment Impacts for the Proposed Toxics Rule 
In addition to addressing the costs and benefits of the proposed Utility Air Toxics Rule 
(Toxics Rule), EPA has estimated preliminary impacts of this rulemaking on labor demand, 
which are presented in this section.4 While a standalone analysis of employment impacts is not 
included in a standard cost-benefit analysis, such an analysis is of particular concern in the 
current economic climate of sustained unemployment. Executive Order 13563, states, ―Our 
regulatory system must protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while 
promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation‖ (emphasis added).  
Therefore, we have provided this analysis to inform the discussion of labor demand and job 
impacts.  We provide an estimate of the employment impacts on the regulated industry over 
time.  We also provide the short-term employment impacts (increase in labor demand) associated

Toxics Rule in 2015.‖

with the construction of needed pollution control equipment until the compliance date of the 
regulation. 
We have not quantified the rule‘s effects on all labor in other sectors not regulated by this 
proposal, or the effects induced by changes in workers‘ incomes. What follows is an overview of 
the various ways that environmental regulation can affect employment, followed by a discussion 
of the estimated impacts of this rule. EPA continues to explore the relevant theoretical and 
empirical literature and to seek public comments in order to ensure that such estimates are as 
accurate, useful and informative as possible. 
From an economic perspective labor is an input into producing goods and services; if 
regulation requires that more labor be used to produce a given amount of output, that additional 
labor is reflected in an increase in the cost of production.  Moreover, when the economy is at full 
employment, we would not expect an environmental regulation to have an impact on overall 
employment because labor is being shifted from one sector to another. On the other hand, in 
periods of high unemployment, an increase in labor demand due to regulation may result in a net 
increase in overall employment. With significant numbers of workers unemployed, the 
opportunity costs associated with displacing jobs in other sectors are likely to be much smaller. 
To provide a partial picture of the employment consequences of this rule, EPA takes two 
approaches.  First, the analysis uses the results of Morgenstern, Pizer, and Shih (2002) to 
estimate the effects of the regulation on the regulated industry, the electric power industry in this 
case.  This approach has been taken by EPA previously in Regulatory Impact Analyses.  (See, 
for example, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the recently finalized Industrial Boilers and 
CISWI rulemakings, promulgated on February 21, 2011).  Second, EPA uses information 
derived from its cost estimation documentation for the IPM model.  Historically, EPA has only 
reported employment impacts on a few regulations.  EPA is interested in public comments on the 
merits of including information derived in this fashion for assessing the employment 
consequences of regulations. 
Section 9.3 discusses the estimates of the employment consequences in the electricity 
sectors, using the Morgenstern, et al. approach.  Section 9.4 estimates the employment 
consequences in the environmental protection sector, using the new approach. 
 9-7 
9.3 Employment Impacts primarily on the regulated industry: Morgenstern, Pizer, and 
Shih (2002) 
EPA examined possible employment effects within the electric utility sector using a peer-
reviewed, published study that explores historical relationships between industrial employment 
and environmental regulations (Morgenstern, Pizer, and Shih, 2002).  The fundamental insight of 
Morgenstern, et al. is that environmental regulations can be understood as requiring regulated 
firms to add a new output (environmental quality) to their product mixes. Although legally 
compelled to satisfy this new demand, regulated firms have to finance this additional production 
with the proceeds of sales of their other (market) products. Satisfying this new demand requires 
additional inputs, including labor, and may alter the relative proportions of labor and capital used 
by regulated firms in their production processes. 
Thus, Morgenstern et al. decompose the overall effect of a regulation on employment into 
the following three subcomponents: 
 The ―Demand Effect‖: higher production costs raise market prices, reducing 
consumption (and production), thereby reducing demand for labor within the 
regulated industry 5; 
 The ―Cost Effect‖: As production costs increase, plants use more of all inputs, 
including labor, to maintain a given level of output.  For example, in order to reduce 
pollutant emissions while holding output levels constant, regulated firms may require 
additional labor; 
 The ―Factor-Shift Effect‖: Regulated firms‘ production technologies may be more or 
less labor intensive after complying with a regulation (i.e., more/less labor is required 
per dollar of output). 
 Decomposing the overall employment impact of environmental regulation into three 
subcomponents clarifies the conceptual relationship between environmental 
regulation and employment in regulated sectors, and permitted Morgenstern, et al. to 
provide an empirical estimate of the net impact. For present purposes, the net effect is 
of particular interest, and is the focus of our analysis. 
Using plant-level Census information between the years 1979 and 1991, Morgenstern et 
al. estimate the size of each effect for four polluting and regulated industries (petroleum, plastic

reductions in output.

material, pulp and paper, and steel). On average across the four industries, each additional $1 
million ($1987) spending on pollution abatement results in a (statistically insignificant) net 
increase of 1.55 (+/- 2.24) jobs. As a result, the authors conclude that increases in pollution 
abatement expenditures do not necessarily cause economically significant employment changes. 
The conclusion is similar to Berman and Bui (2001) who found that increased air quality 
regulation in Los Angeles did not cause in large employment changes6. 
Since the Morgenstern, et al. parameter estimates are expressed in jobs per million 
($1987)7 of environmental compliance expenditures, their study offers a transparent and simple 
way to transfer estimates for other employment analysis. For each of the three job effects 
outlined above, EPA used the Morgenstern et al. four industry average parameters and standard 
errors along with the estimated private compliance costs to provide a range of electricity sector 
employment effects associated with the proposed Toxics Rule. 
By applying these estimates to pollution abatement costs for the proposed rule for the 
electric power sector, we estimated each effect. The results are 
 Demand effect:  −45,000 to +2,500 jobs in the directly affected sector with a central 
estimate of −21,000; 
 Cost effect:  +4,700 to +24,000 jobs in the directly affected sector with a central 
estimate of +14,000; and 
 Factor-shift effect:  +200 to +32,000 jobs in the directly affected sector with a central 
estimate of +16,000. 
 EPA estimates the net employment effect to range from 17,000 to +35,000 jobs in the 
directly affected sector with a central estimate of +9,000.
 8, 9 
These estimates are shown in Table 9-3.

 For alternative views, see Henderson (1996) and Greenstone (2002).

 The Morgenstern et al. analysis uses ―production worker‖ as defined in the US Census Bureau‘s Annual Survey of 
Manufactures (ASM)  in order to define a job.  This definition can be found on the Internet at 
http://www.census.gov/manufacturing/asm/definitions/index.html.

 Since Morgenstern‘s analysis reports environmental expenditures in $1987, we make an inflation adjustment the 
IPM costs using the ratio of the consumer price index, U.S. city, all items reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics: CPI1987/ CPI2007 = (113.6/207.3) = 0.55

 Net employment effect = 1.55× $10,900 million × 0.55.  This estimated net result is not statistically different from 
zero.

According to the 2007 Economic Census, the electric power generation, transmission and distribution sector 
(NAICS 2211) had approximately 510,000 paid employees.  Both the midpoint and range for each effect are 
reported in the last row of the table. 
All ranges for these job changes are based on the 95
th
 percentile of results.  EPA 
recognizes there may be other employment effects which are not considered in the Morgenstern 
et al. study. For example, employment in environmental protection industries may increase as 
firms purchase more pollution control equipment and services to meet the proposed rule‘s 
requirements. EPA does provide such an estimate of employment change later in this section in a 
separate analysis. On the other hand, industries that use electricity will face higher electricity 
prices as the result of the toxics rule, reduce output, and demand less labor. We do not currently 
have sufficient information to quantify these as potential employment gains or losses. 
9.3.1 Limitations 
Although the Morgenstern et al. paper provides information about the potential job 
effects of environmental protection programs, there are several caveats associated with using 
those estimates to analyze the final rule. First, the Morgenstern et al. estimates presented in 
Table 9-3 and used in EPA‘s analysis represent the weighted average parameter estimates for a 
set of manufacturing industries (pulp and paper, plastics, petroleum, and steel). Morgenstern, et 
al. present those industries‘ estimates separately, and they range from -1.13 jobs per $1 million 
(in 1987 dollars) of environmental expenditures for pulp and paper, to +6.90 jobs for plastics.  
Only two of the total jobs estimates are statistically significantly different from zero, and the 
 9-10 
overall weighted average used here, 1.55 jobs per $1 million, is not statistically significant.  
Moreover, here we are applying the estimate to the electricity generating industry. 
Second, relying on Morgenstern et al. implicitly assumes that estimates derived from 
1979–1991 data are still applicable.  Third, the methodology used in Morgenstern et al. assumes 
that regulations affect plants in proportion to their total costs. In other words, each additional 
dollar of regulatory burden affects a plant by an amount equal to that plant‘s total costs relative 
to the aggregate industry costs. By transferring the estimates, EPA assumes a similar distribution 
of regulatory costs by plant size and that the regulatory burden does not disproportionately fall 
on smaller or larger plants. 
9.4 Employment Impacts of the Proposed Toxics Rule-Environmental Protection Sector 
Approach by 2015 10 
Regulations set in motion new orders for pollution control equipment and services. New 
categories of employment have been created in the process of implementing regulations to make 
our air safer to breathe. When a regulation is promulgated, the first response of industry is to 
order pollution control equipment and services in order to comply with the regulation when it 
becomes effective.  Revenue and employment in the environmental technology industry have 
grown steadily between 2000 and 2008, reaching an industry total of approximately $300 billion 
in revenues and 1.7 million employees in 2008.11  While these revenues and employment figures 
represent gains for the environmental technologies industry, they are costs to the regulated 
industries required to install the equipment.  Moreover, it is not clear the 1.7 million employees 
in 2008 represent anything other than workers diverted from other productive employment as 
opposed to new additional employment. 
Regulated firms hire workers to operate and maintain pollution controls. Once the 
equipment is installed, regulated firms hire workers to operate and maintain the pollution control 
equipment – much like they hire workers to produce more output. A study by Resources for the 
                                                 
10
 EPA expects that the installation of retrofit control equipment in response to the requirements of this proposal will 
primarily take place within 3 years of the effective date of the final rule, but there may be a possibility that some 
installations may occur within 4 years of the effective date.  
11
 In 2008, the industry totaled approximately $315 billion in revenues and 1.9 million employees including indirect 
employment effects, pollution abatement equipment production employed approximately 4.2 million workers in 
2008. These indirect employment effects are based on a multiplier for indirect employment = 2.24 (1982 value 
from Nestor and Pasurka - approximate middle of range of multipliers 1977-1991). Environmental Business

Future examined how regulated industries respond to regulation.  They found that on average, 
employment goes up in regulated firms.12
,13 Of course, these firms may also reassign existing 
employees to do these activities. 
Environmental regulations support employment in many basic industries. In addition to 
the increase in employment in the environmental protection industry (increased orders for 
pollution control equipment), environmental regulations also support employment in industries 
that provide intermediate goods to the environmental protection industry.  For example, $1 
billion in capital expenditures to reduce air pollution involves the purchase of abatement 
equipment. The equipment manufacturers, in turn, order steel, tanks, vessels, blowers, pumps, 
and chemicals to manufacture and install the equipment. 
A study (2008) by Bezdek, Wendling, and DiPernab found that investments in 
environmental protection industries create jobs and displace jobs, but the net effect on 
employment is positive.‖14 
The focus of this part of the employment analysis is on short-term jobs related to the 
compliance actions of the affected entities.  This analysis estimates of the employment impacts 
due to the increased demand for pollution control retrofits.15 Results indicate that the Toxics Rule 
has the potential to result in a net increase of labor in these industries, driven by the high demand 
for new pollution controls. Overall, the preliminary results of the environmental protection sector 
approach indicate that the Toxics Rule could support an increase of about 31,000 job-years16 by 
2015.

 Numbers of job years are not the same as numbers of individual jobs, but represents the amount of work that can 
be performed by the equivalent of one full-time individual for a year (or FTE). For example, 25 job years may be 
equivalent to five full-time workers for five years, twenty-five full-time workers for one year, or one full-time 
worker for twenty-five years.

9.4.1 Overall Approach and Methodology for Environmental Protection Sector Approach 
EPA commissioned ICF International to provide estimates for the Environmental 
Protection Sector, and the analysis utilizes a bottom-up engineering based methodology 
combined with macroeconomic data on industrial output and productivity, to estimate 
employment impacts.  It relies heavily on the cost analysis from the IPM model which uses labor 
and capital estimates to derive control costs. The approach also relies upon prior EPA studies on 
similar issues, and in particular uses data and information from an extensive resource study 
conducted in 2002, which was updated for purposes of the proposed rule to reflect more recent 
information.17 The approach involves using IPM projected results from the proposed Toxics Rule 
analysis for the set of pollution control technologies expected to be installed to comply with the 
rule, along with data from secondary sources, to estimate the job impacts using this approach.18 
This will cover the labor needed to design, manufacture and install the needed pollution control 
equipment over the 3 to 4 years leading up to compliance in 2015. 
For construction labor, the labor needs are derived from the 2002 EPA resource analysis 
for installing various retrofits (FGD – Flue Gas Desulfurization scrubbers, SCR- selective 
catalytic reduction, ACI – activated carbon injection, DSI -  dry sorbent injection, and FF 0- 
Fabric Filters) and are further classified into different labor categories, such as boilermakers, 
engineers and a catch-all ―other installation labor.‖  For the inputs needed (e.g., steel), the 2002 
resource study was used to determine the steel demand for each MW of additional pollution 
control and combined with labor productivity data from the Economic Census and BLS for 
relevant industries. 
More detail on methodology, assumptions, and data sources can be found in the TSD 
―Employment Estimates of Direct Labor in Response to the Proposed Toxics Rule in 2015.‖ 
Projections from IPM were used to estimate the incremental retrofit capacities projected 
in response to the proposed rule. These additional pollution controls are shown in Table 9-4 
below, and reflect the added pollution controls needed to meet the requirements of the rule.  
Additional information on the power sector impacts can be found in Chapter 8 of the RIA.

9.4.2 Summary of Employment Estimates from Environmental Protection Sector Approach 
Table 9-5 presents additional detail on the estimated employment impacts using the 
environmental protection sector approach resulting from the proposed Toxics Rule. Results for 
the Environmental Protection Sector Approach indicate the proposed Toxics Rule could support 
or create roughly 31,000 one-time job-years of increased cost of direct labor, driven by the need 
to build the pollution control retrofits.

9.4.3 Other Employment Impacts of the Proposed Toxics Rule 
We expect ongoing employment impacts on regulated and non-regulated entities for a 
variety of reasons.  These include labor changes in the regulated entities resulting from shifts in 
demand for fuel changes, increased demand for materials to operate pollution control equipment, 
changes in employment resulting from coal retirements, and changes in other industries due to 
changes in the price of electricity and natural gas.  We provide preliminary estimates of some of 
                                                 
19
 In the policy case modeling, EPA assumes that a fabric filter (also known as a baghouse) is necessary for coal- 
and solid-oil derived fuel-fired EGUs to meet the total PM standard.  The estimate for FFs include here is for 
stand-alone FFs, and does not include some additional FFs that may be installed in conjunction with other 
pollution controls (e.g., in combination with a dry scrubber).  
 9-14 
these effects below.  The most notable of the ones we are unable to estimate are the impacts on 
employment as a result of the increase in electricity and other energy prices in the economy.  
Because of this inability to estimate all the important employment impacts, EPA neither sums the 
impacts that the Agency is able to estimate for the ongoing non-regulated group or make any 
inferences of whether there is a net gain or loss of employment for the non-regulated group. 
These other ongoing employment impacts are found in Table 9-6.

9.5 Summary 
The three approaches use different analytical techniques and are applied to different 
industries during different time periods, and they use different units of analysis.  These estimates 
should not be summed because of the different metrics, length and methods of analysis.  The 
Morgenstern estimates are used for the ongoing employment impacts for the regulated entities 
(the electric power sector).  The short term estimates for employment needed to design, 
construct, and install the control equipment in the three or four year period leading up to the 
compliance date are also provided.  Finally some of the other types of employment impacts that 
will be ongoing are estimated.

APPENDIX E.  
OAQPS MULTIMARKET MODEL TO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC  
IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
E.1 Introduction 
An economic impact analysis (EIA) provides information about a policy‘s effects (i.e., 
social costs); emphasis is also placed on how the costs are distributed among stakeholders (EPA, 
2010). In addition, large-scale policies that may affect a large number of industries or a 
substantial part of the whole economy require additional analysis to better understand how costs 
are passed across the economy. Although several tools are available to estimate social costs, 
current EPA guidelines suggest that multimarket models ―…are best used when potential 
economic impacts and equity effects on related markets might be considerable‖ and modeling 
using a computable general equilibrium model is not available or practical (EPA, 2010, p. 9-21). 
Other guides for environmental economists offer similar advice (Berck and Hoffmann, 2002; 
Just, Hueth, and Schmitz, 2004). 
Multimarket models focus on ―short-run‖ time horizons and measure a policy‘s near term 
or transition costs (EPA, 1999). Recent studies suggest short-run analyses can complement full 
dynamic general equilibrium analysis. 
The multimarket model described in this appendix is a new addition to the Office of Air 
Quality Planning and Standards‘ (OAQPS‘s) economic model tool kit; it is designed to be used 
as a transparent tool that can respond quickly to requests about how stakeholders in 100 U.S. 
industries might respond to new environmental policy. It was used to analyze the economic 
impacts of the industrial boiler NESHAP and CISWI final rules recently signed by EPA. Next, 
we provide an overview of the model, data, and parameters. 
E.2 Multimarket Model 
The multimarket model contains the following features: 
 Industry sectors and benchmark data set 
– 100 industry sectors 
– a single benchmark year (2015)1 
                                                 
1
 As mentioned in Chapter 9, we use 2015 as a proxy for 2016 in order to maintain consistency between the analysis 
from this model and the IPM outputs (generated for 2015, as mentioned in Chapter 8) that serve as inputs to this 
analysis. 
 E-2 
 Economic behavior 
– industries respond to regulatory costs by changing production rates 
– market prices rise to reflect higher energy and other nonenergy material costs 
– customers respond to these price increases and consumption falls 
 Model scope 
– 100 sectors are linked with each other based on their use of energy and other 
nonenergy materials. For example, the construction industry is linked with the 
petroleum, cement, and steel industries and is influenced by price changes that 
occur in each sector. The links allow EPA to account for indirect effects the 
regulation has on related markets. 
– Links come from input-output information from IMPLAN as used in OAQPS‘s 
computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, the Economic Model for Policy 
Analysis (EMPAX) 
– production adjustments influence employment levels 
– international trade (imports/exports) behavior considered 
 Model time horizon (―short-run‖) 
– fixed production resources (e.g., capital) leads to an upward-sloping industry 
supply function 
firms cannot alter input mixes; there is no substitution among intermediate 
production inputs 
– investment and government expenditures are fixed. 
 Labor  and Capital Markets and Pre-existing Distortions in Other Markets 
– Unlike CGE models, our multimarket model does not include a national labor or 
capital market.  As a result, we do not estimate real wage changes, changes in 
labor /leisure choices, or savings and investment decisions within the model.  
Therefore we do not consider whether policies interact with existing distortions, 
particularly tax distortions in a ways that increase or decrease estimates of the 
social cost.  Since savings and investment decisions are not modeled, social costs 
associated with capital stock changes are also not considered. 
 E.2.1 Industry Sectors and Benchmark Data Set 
The multimarket model includes 100 industries. For the benchmark year, the model uses 
information from OAQPS‘s computable general equilibrium model‘s balanced social accounting 
matrix (SAM) and the following accounting identity holds: 
 Output + Imports = Consumption + Investment + Government + Exports (E.1) 
 E-3 
If we abstract and treat each industry as a national market, the identity represents the 
prepolicy (baseline) market-clearing condition, or benchmark ―equilibrium‖; supply equals 
demand in each market. In Table E-1, we identify the 100 industries for the multimarket model; 
Table E-2 provides the 2015 benchmark data set. Since the benchmark data are reported in value 
terms, we also use the common ―Harberger convention‖ and choose units where are all prices are 
one in the benchmark equilibrium (Shoven and Whalley, 1995).

E.2.2 Economic Behavior 
E.2.2.1 U.S. Supply 
In a postpolicy scenario (e.g. a MACT or NSPS such as those in the Toxics Rule), 
industry responds to changes in the new market-clearing ―net‖ price for the good or service sold: 
 %Δ‖net‖ price = %Δ market price − %Δ direct costs − %Δ indirect costs (E.2) 
The %Δ direct costs are approximated using the IPM cost analysis and baseline value of 
output. For example, with the $11 billion increase in compliance costs for the electricity sector 
(ELE), IPM projects a 3.77 percent increase in the retail price of electricity as mentioned in 
Chapter 8 of this RIA. For the electric power sector (EPS), percentage change in direct costs 
would be represented in the model as follows: 
 %Δ direct costs = 3.77% (E.3) 
To ensure the market-clearing electricity price matches IPM results, we adjust the supply 
elasticity to reflect a horizontal supply function (i.e. supply is infinitely elastic near market 
equilibrium). 
The multimarket model simultaneously considers how the policy influences other 
industry supply functions (via changes in energy and other intermediate material prices). As a 
result, the multimarket model can provide additional information about how policy costs (higher 
electricity prices) are transmitted through the economy in the short run. As shown in Figure E-1, 
the higher electricity prices provide other industries with incentives to alter production rates at 
current market prices; market prices must rise to maintain the original prepolicy production 
levels (Q). As shown in Figure E-2, the other indirect cost change provides the industry with 
additional incentives to alter production rates at current market prices. 
The %Δ indirect effects associated with each input are approximated using an input ―use‖ 
ratio and the price change that occurs in the input market. 
 %Δ indirect costs = input use ratio x %Δ input price (E.4) 
The social accounting matrix provides an internally consistent estimate of the use ratio 
and describes the dollar amount of an input that is required to produce a dollar of output. Higher 
ratios suggest strong links between industries, while lower ratios suggest weaker links. Given the 
short time horizon such as that for this analysis with a compliance year of 2015, we assume the 
 E-11 
input use ratio is fixed and cannot adjust their input mix; this is a standard assumption in public 
and commercial input-output (IO) and SAM multiplier models (Berck and Hoffmann, 2002). 
Morgenstern and colleagues (2004) and Ho and colleagues (2008) also use this assumption when 
examining near-term effects of environmental policy.

Prices

Following guidance in the OAQPS economic resource manual (EPA, 1999), we use a

t  = direct compliance costs per unit of supply 
gi  = input use ratio (g using input i) 
iP  = with-policy input (i) price 
iP  = benchmark input (i) price 
g  = price elasticity of supply for output (g) 
The key supply parameter that controls the industry production adjustments is the price 
elasticity of supply (εg).
 To our knowledge, there is no existing empirical work that estimates 
short-run supply elasticities for all industry groups used in the multimarket model. As a result, 
we assume the U.S. supply elasticities are a function of econometrically estimated rest-of-world 
(ROW) export supply elasticities (see discussion in the next section). We report the values 
currently available in the model in Table E-5.

International competition is captured by a single ROW supply function:

gQ  = with-policy supply quantity (g)

gP   = with-policy U.S. price for output (g) 
ROW
g  = price elasticity of supply of goods from the ROW to the United States (imports) 
(g) 
The key supply parameter that controls the ROW supply adjustments is the price 
elasticity of supply ( ROWg ). We obtained these estimates for a variety of industry groups from a 
recently published article by Broda and colleagues (2008b). 
E.2.2.3 Price Elasticity of Supply: Rest of World (ROW) 
Broda and colleagues (2008a and 2008b) provide an empirical basis for the multimarket 
model supply elasticities. Broda et al. provide over 1,000 long-run trade elasticities that RTI 
organized to be comparable with the 100-sector model. The first step was to match the 
Harmonized Trade System (HS) elasticities estimated in the article to the appropriate NAICS 
 E-13 
codes. Many of the HS codes correspond with a detailed NAICS codes (5- and 6-digit level), 
while the multimarket sector industries typically correspond with more aggregated sectors 
(NAICS 2-, 3-, or 4-digit levels). To adapt these labels to our model, we combined the 5- and 6-
digit NAICS under their 3- and 4-digit codes and calculated an average elasticity value for codes 
that fell within the multimarket model‘s aggregate industrial sectors.1 This gives a crude way to 
account for the variety of products detailed in the original data set. We also restricted the long- 
run elasticity sample to those that Broda et al. classify as ―medium‖ and ―low‖ long-run 
categories; these categories tend to have lower elasticity values that are more likely to be 
consistent with the multimarket model‘s modeling horizon (i.e., in the short run, importers are 
likely to have less flexibility to respond to price changes implying the elasticities are low rather 
than high).2 
Our ideal preference was to use an exact 3- or 4-digit match from the medium category if 
one was available. If the multimarket model had a 4-digit code for which there was no direct 
match, we aggregated up a level and applied the relevant 3-digit elasticity. If a multimarket code 
was not covered in the medium set of elasticities, we used the low elasticity category. This 
method was sufficient for mapping the majority of the sectors in the model. After applying our 
inverse elasticity values to the multimarket sectors, we calculated the inverse of the value to 
arrive at the actual supply elasticity. Since Broda et al.‘s article focused on industrial production 
goods, some of the multimarket sectors were not covered in the elasticity data. These sectors 
included mainly service industries, transportation, and energy sources. 
                                                 
1
 Given Broda et al.‘s research design, the parameter estimates reported are inverse export supply elasticities. For 
example, a reported parameter estimate for inverse export supply elasticity of 1.6 would imply a ROW supply 
elasticity of 1/1.6, or 0.6. A one percent increase in the domestic price lead to an 0.6 increase in the volume of 
goods supplied (i.e., exported) to the U.S. by other countries (p. 2043).  
2
 Broda et al.‘s intent was to use these categories to describe or proxy for domestic market power.

For this analysis, EPA adjusted the domestic supply elasticity parameter to approximate a horizontal market 
supply function. This allows the multi-market model to replicate the predicted retail price changes estimated by 
IPM. 
Note: RTI mapped Broda et al. data for their industry aggregation to the multimarket model‘s 100 industries. 
Domestic supply elasticities are typically assumed to be within one standard deviation of the sample of 
supply elasticities used for the ROW. In selected cases where this information is not available, the U.S. 
supply elasticity is set equal to the ROW.

ities.html. Accessed September 2009. 
In order to fill these gaps, we turned to the source substitution elasticities from Purdue 
University‘s Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP).1  Although the elasticities in the GTAP 
model are a different type of international trade elasticity and cannot be directly applied in the 
multimarket model (e.g., they are based on the Armington structure2), the parameters provide us 
with some additional information about the relative trade elasticity differences between industry 
sectors. To use the GTAP information to develop assumptions about the multimarket model 
sectors with missing elasticities, we chose a base industrial sector (iron and steel) for which we 
had parameter value from Broda et al.  Next, we developed industry-specific ratios for missing 
industries using the corresponding GTAP sector trade elasticities and the GTAP iron and steel 
sector.  We multiplied the resulting ratio by the Broda et al. iron and steel parameter (1.0). For 
example, the GTAP trade elasticity for coal (6.10) is approximately 2.2 times the trade elasticity 
for iron and steel (2.95).  As a result, the multimarket import supply elasticity for coal is 
computed as 2.2 (2.2 x 1.0). 
F.2.2.4 Price Elasticity of Supply: United States 
We also used Broda et al.‘s elasticities to derive a set of domestic supply elasticities for 
the model. We have assumed that a product‘s domestic supply would be equal to or less elastic

 See Chapter 14 of the GTAP 7 Database Documentation for the full description of the parameters at 
https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/4184.pdf; see Table 14.2 for elasticities.

 Detailed documentation of the entire GTAP 7 Database is available at 
https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v7/v7_doco.asp. The GTAP also uses a unique system of 
categorizing commodities that does not match the NAICS or HS system exactly.

than other countries‘ supply of imports. When we aggregated and averaged the original 
elasticities to the 3- and 4-digit NAICS level for our foreign supply elasticities, we also 
calculated the standard deviation of each 3- and 4-digit NAICS sample. By adding the standard 
deviation to the corresponding foreign supply and then taking the inverse, we were able to 
calculate a domestic supply elasticity for each sector that was lower than its foreign counterpart 
while maintaining the structure of the original elasticities. For sectors in which no standard 
deviation was available,1 we used professional judgment to apply the closest available substitute 
from a similar industry. Without a comparable way of scaling our foreign elasticities for the 
sectors in which we used the GTAP elasticities, we elected to keep the domestic and foreign 
supply elasticities the same. 
E.2.2.5 Demand 
Uses for industry output are divided into three groups: investment/government use, 
domestic intermediate uses, and other final use (domestic and exports). Given the short time 
horizon, investment/government does not change. Intermediate use is determined by the input 
use ratios and the industry output decisions. 
 ggii
QQ 
 (E.7) 
iQ  = with-policy input demand quantity (i) 
gi  = input use ratio (g using input i) 
gQ  = with-policy output quantity (g) 
Other final use does respond to market price changes. Following guidance in the OAQPS 
economic resource manual (EPA, 1999), we use a general form for the U.S. industry demand 
function: 
 
  ggg PaQ

 (E.8) 
where 
gQ  = with-policy demand quantity (g) 
a  = calibrated scale parameter for the demand and price relationship 
gP   = with-policy price for output (g) 
g  = price elasticity of demand (g) 
                                                 
1
No standard deviations were calculated for the 3- and 4-digit codes that had only one observation (i.e., Broda 
et al.‘s model used the exact 3- or 4-digit code). 
 E-19 
The key parameter that controls consumption adjustments is the price elasticity of 
demand (ηg). To approximate the response, we use demand elasticities reported in Ho, 
Morgenstern, and Shih (2008). To estimate the demand elasticities, Ho, Morgenstern, and Shih 
used a CGE model1 and simulate the effects of placing a small tax on output and recording the 
quantity change. The general equilibrium quantity change associated with the tax considers all 
price and income changes that led to the quantity change. Table E-6 reports the values taken 
from Ho, Morgenstern, and Shih (2008) that are currently used for demand responses of other 
final uses (domestic and exports). 
The current version of the multimarket model does not currently consider the 
consequences of exogenous demand shocks to the scale parameter (a) that the policy may bring 
about.  For example, IPM explicitly models changes in fuel use (a switch from coal to natural 
gas) that utilities may use to meet the proposed Toxics Rule.  Increases in natural gas demand 
subsequently lead to price increases for natural gas.2  As a result of higher natural gas prices, 
industries with more intensive natural gas use may shrink while those with less intensive natural 
gas use may expand. A similar story with opposite effects occurs in the coal market; reduced 
demand lowers coal prices and may result in surplus loss for the coal industry. The proposed 
Toxics Rule may also increase the demand for materials for retrofits and increases in the prices 
of those goods as well as the demand for retrofit equipment; the demand increase will lead to 
relative expansion and contraction of industries.  EPA acknowledges that the current multimarket 
model does not account for these types of changes in the market demand curves. 
E.2.2.6 Model Scope 
The multimarket model includes 100 sectors covering energy, manufacturing, and service 
applications. Each sector‘s production technology requires the purchase of energy and other 
intermediate goods made by other sectors included in the model. Linking the sectors in this 
manner allows the model to trace direct and indirect policy effects across different sectors. 
Therefore, it is best used when potential economic impacts and equity effects on related markets 
might be important to stakeholders not directly affected by an environmental policy. However, 
the model can also be run in single-market partial equilibrium mode to support and provide 
insights for other types of environmental policies.

  The authors use the Adkins–Garbaccio CGE Model (Adkins, 2006).   
2
 However, IPM treats the natural price increase as a cost to the electricity sector, but does not simultaneously 
consider that higher prices may result in a surplus gain to owners of natural gas reserves.   
 E-20 
E.2.2.7 Model Time Horizon 
The model is designed to address short-run and transitional effects associated with 
environmental policy. Production technologies are fixed; the model does not assess substitution 
among production inputs (labor, energy intermediates, and other intermediates) and assumes 
each investment cannot be changed during the time frame of the analysis. These issues are better 
addressed using other frameworks such as CGE modeling. Similarly, government purchases 
from each sector do not adjust in response to changes in goods/service prices. Although, 
employment levels (number of jobs) adjust as production levels change, wages are assumed to be 
fixed.

STATUTORY AND EXECUTIVE ORDER ANALYSES 
10.1 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA; 5 U.S.C.§ 601 et seq.), as amended by the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law No. 104-121), provides that 
whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking, it must 
prepare and make available an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), unless it certifies that 
the proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities (5 U.S.C. § 605[b]).  Small entities include small businesses, small 
organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.  An IRFA describes the economic impact of 
the proposed rule on small entities and any significant alternatives to the proposed rule that 
would accomplish the objectives of the rule while minimizing significant economic impacts on 
small entities. 
This IRFA has been prepared following EPA‘s guidance document for preparing initial 
and final regulatory flexibility analyses.1 
10.1.1 Reasons why Action is Being Considered 
In 2000, EPA made a finding that it was appropriate and necessary to regulate coal- and 
oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112 
and listed EGUs pursuant to CAA section 112(c).  On March 29, 2005 (70 FR 15,994), EPA 
published a final rule (Section 112(n) Revision Rule) that removed EGUs from the list of sources 
for which regulation under CAA section 112 was required.  That rule was published in 
conjunction with a rule requiring reductions in emissions of mercury from EGUs pursuant to 
CAA section 111 (Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), May 18, 2005, 70 FR 28606).  The Section 
112(n) Revision Rule was vacated on February 8, 2008, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia Circuit.  As a result of that vacatur, CAMR was also vacated and EGUs 
remain on the list of sources that must be regulated under CAA section 112.  This action 
provides EPA‘s proposed rule in response to the court‘s decisions.  Under authority of CAA 
section 112, EPA is proposing a national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants 
(NESHAP) for EGUs that will regulate units at both major and area sources (henceforth referred 
to as the Toxics Rule).

1.1) Statement of Objectives and Legal Basis for Proposed Rules 
The proposed rule would protect air quality and promote public health by reducing 
emissions of the HAP.  In the December 2000 regulatory determination, EPA made a finding that 
it was appropriate and necessary to regulate EGUs under CAA section 112.  The February 2008 
vacatur of the Section 112(n) Revision Rule reverted the status to that of the December 2000 
regulatory determination.  CAA section 112(n)(1)(A) and the 2000 determination do not 
differentiate between EGUs located at major versus area sources of HAP.  Thus, the NESHAP 
for EGUs will regulate units at both major and area sources.  Major sources of HAP are those 
that have the potential to emit at least 10 tons per year (tpy) of any one HAP or at least 25 tpy of 
any combination of HAP. 
1.2) Description and Estimate of the Affected Small Entities 
For the purposes of assessing the impacts of the proposed Toxics Rule on small entities, a 
small entity is defined as: 
(1) A small business according to the Small Business Administration size standards by 
the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) category of the 
owning entity.  The NAICS affected by this proposed rule is 221122 (fossil fuel-
fired electric utility steam generating units) and 921150 (fossil fuel-fired electric 
utility steam generating units in Indian country).  The range of small business size 
standards for electric utilities is 4 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of production or 
less; 
(2) A small government jurisdiction that is a government of a city, county, town, 
district, or special district with a population of less than 50,000; and 
(3) A small organization that is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently 
owned and operated and is not dominant in its field. 
EPA examined the potential economic impacts to small entities associated with this 
rulemaking based on assumptions of how the affected entities will install control technologies in 
compliance with the Toxics Rule.  This analysis does not examine potential indirect economic 
impacts associated with the proposed rule, such as employment effects in industries providing 
fuel and pollution control equipment, or the potential effects of electricity price increases on 
industries and households. 
 10-3 
EPA used Velocity Suite‘s Ventyx data as a basis for identifying plant ownership and 
compiling the list of potentially affected small entities.
1
  The Ventyx dataset contains detailed 
ownership and corporate affiliation information.  The analysis focused only on those EGUs 
affected by the proposed rule, which includes units burning coal, oil, petroleum coke, or coal 
refuse as the primary fuel, and excludes any combustion turbine units or EGUs burning natural 
gas.  Also, because the rule does not affect combustion units with an equivalent electricity 
generating capacity up to 25 megawatts (MW), small entities that do not own at least one 
combustion unit with a capacity greater than  25 MW were removed from the dataset.  For the 
affected units remaining, boiler and generator capacity, heat input, generation, and emissions 
data were aggregated by owner and then by parent company.  Entities with more than 4 billion 
kWh of annual electricity generation were removed from the list, as were municipal-owned 
entities with a population greater than 50,000.  For cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, and 
subdivisions that generate less than 4 billion kWh of electricity annually but which may be part 
of a large entity, additional research on power sales, operating revenues, and other business 
activities was performed to make a final determination regarding size.  Finally, small entities for 
which the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) does not project generation in 2015 in the base case 
were omitted from the analysis because they are not projected to be operating and, thus, will not 
face the costs of compliance with the proposed rule.  After omitting entities for the reasons 
above, EPA identified a total of 83 potentially affected small entities that are affiliated with 102 
electric generating units. 
1.3) Compliance Cost Impacts 
This section presents the methodology and results for estimating the impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities in 2015 based on the following endpoints: 
 annual economic impacts of the proposed Toxics Rule on small entities and 
 ratio of small entity compliance cost impacts to revenues from electricity generation.2 
10.1.2 Methodology for Estimating Impacts of the Toxics Rule on Small Entities 
EPA estimated compliance costs of the proposed Toxics Rule as follows: 
 CCompliance = Δ COperating+Capital + Δ CFuel + Δ R 
                                                 
1
  For more information, please visit www.ventyx.com.  This dataset was also a basis for identifying plant ownership 
and compiling the list of potentially affected small entities for the proposed Transport Rule issued by EPA in 
July, 2010.   
2
 This methodology for estimating small entity impacts has been used in recent EPA rulemakings such as the 
proposed Transport Rule issued by EPA in July, 2010.   
 10-4 
where C represents a component of cost as labeled, and Δ R represents the value of change in 
electricity generation, calculated as the difference in revenues between the base case and the 
proposed Toxics Rule. 
Based on this formula, compliance costs for a given small entity could either be positive 
or negative (i.e., cost savings) based on their compliance choices and market conditions.  Under 
the proposed Toxics Rule, some units will forgo some level of electricity generation (and, thus, 
revenues) to comply and this impact will be lessened on those entities by the projected increase 
in electricity prices under the MACT scenario (which raises their revenues from the remainder of 
their sales).  On the other hand, some units may increase electricity generation, and coupled with 
the increase in electricity prices, will see an increase in electricity revenues resulting in lower net 
compliance costs.  If entities are able to increase revenue more than an increase in retrofit and 
fuel costs, ultimately they will have negative net compliance costs (or savings).  Because this 
analysis evaluates the total costs as a sum of the costs associated with compliance choices as well 
as changes in electricity revenues, it captures savings or gains such as those described.  As a 
result, what EPA describes as a cost is really more of a measure of the net economic impact of 
the rule on small entities. 
For this analysis, EPA used unit-level IPM parsed outputs to estimate costs based on the 
parameters above.  These impacts were then summed for each small entity, adjusting for 
ownership share.1
 
 Net impact estimates were based on the following: changes in operating and 
capital costs, driven mainly by retrofit installations or upgrades, change in fuel costs, and change 
in electricity generation revenues under the proposed Toxics Rule relative to the base case.  
These individual components of compliance cost were estimated as follows: 
(1) Operating and capital costs:  Using the IPM parsed outputs for the base case and 
the proposed Toxics Rule policy case, EPA identified units that installed one or more 
pollution control technologies under the proposed rule.  The equations for calculating 
operating and capital costs were adopted from technology assumptions used in EPA‘s 
version of IPM (version 4.10).  The model calculates the capital cost (in $/MW); the 
fixed operation and maintenance (O&M) cost (in $/MW-year); and the variable O&M 
cost (in $/MWh). 
                                                 
1
 Unit-level cost impacts are adjusted for ownership shares for individual small entities, so as not to overestimate 
burden on each company.  If an individual unit is owned by multiple small entities, total costs for that unit to 
meet the MACT obligations are distributed across all owners based on the percentage of the unit owned by each 
company.  Ownership percentage was estimated based on the Ventyx database. 
 10-5 
(2) Fuel costs:  Fuel costs were estimated by multiplying fuel input (in million British 
thermal units, MMBtu) by region and fuel prices ($/MMBtu) from IPM.  The 
incremental fuel expenditures under the proposed Toxics Rule were then estimated by 
taking the difference in fuel costs between the proposed Toxics Rule and the base 
case. 
(3) Value of electricity generated:  EPA estimated electricity generation by first 
estimating unit capacity factor and maximum fuel capacity.  Unit capacity factor is 
estimated by dividing fuel input (MMBtu) by maximum fuel capacity (MMBtu).  The 
maximum fuel capacity was estimated by multiplying capacity (MW) * 8,760 
operating hours * heat rate (MMBtu/MWh).  The value of electricity generated is then 
estimated by multiplying capacity (MW) * capacity factor * 8,760 * regional-adjusted 
retail electricity price ($/MWh), for all entities except those categorized as ―Private‖ 
in Ventyx.  For private entities, EPA used wholesale electricity price instead retail 
electricity price because most of the private entities are independent power producers 
(IPP).  IPPs sell their electricity to wholesale purchasers and do not own transmission 
facilities and, thus, their revenue was estimated with wholesale electricity prices. 
10.1.3 Results 
The number of potentially affected small entities by ownership type and potential impacts 
of the proposed Toxics Rule are summarized in Table 10-1.  All costs are presented in 2007 
dollars.  EPA estimated the annualized net compliance cost to small entities to be approximately 
$379 million in 2015.

have cost savings under the MACT policy case (see text above for an explanation). 
 * Two of the four identified private entities exceed the 3% threshold of incremental costs as a percentage of 
revenues, while the other two, though not necessarily exceeding the threshold according to EPA‘s 
calculations, are considered to be significantly impacted as a result of having to shut down and are listed as 
such in the table.

EPA assessed the economic and financial impacts of the proposed rule using the ratio of 
compliance costs to the value of revenues from electricity generation, and our results focus on 
those entities for which this measure could be greater than 1 percent or 3 percent.  Of the 83 
small entities identified, EPA‘s analysis shows 59 entities may experience compliance costs 
greater than 1 percent of base generation revenues in 2015, and 45 may experience compliance 
costs greater than 3 percent of base revenues.  Also, 6 small entities are estimated to have all of 
their affected units retire.  The cost of a unit retiring is estimated as the base case profit that is 
forgone by not operating under the policy case.  Because 45 of the 83 total units, or more than 50 
percent, are estimated to incur compliance cost greater than 3 percent of base revenues, EPA has 
concluded that it cannot certify that there will be no SISNOSE for this proposed rule.1

Results for small entities discussed here do not account for the reality that electricity markets are regulated in parts 
of the country.  Entities operating in regulated or cost-of-service markets should be able to recover all of their 
costs of compliance through rate adjustments. 
 10-7 
The separate components of annualized costs to small entities under the proposed Toxics 
Rule are summarized in Table 10-2.  The most significant components of incremental costs to 
these entities are the increased capital and operating costs for retrofits, followed by changes in 
electricity revenues.

Capital and operating costs increase across all ownership types, but the direction of 
changes in electricity revenues vary among ownership types.  Municipals experience a net gain 
in electricity revenues under the proposed Toxics Rule, mainly due to higher electricity prices 
under the policy case.  All other ownership types are estimated to experience a net loss in 
electricity revenue.  The change in electricity revenue takes into account both the profit lost from 
units that do not operate under the policy case and the difference in revenue for operating units 
under the policy case.  According to IPM results, an estimated 1.1 GW of capacity owned by 
small entities are considered uneconomical to operate under the policy case, resulting in a net 
loss of $258 MM (millions 2007$) in profits.  On the other hand, many operating units actually 
increase their electricity revenue due to higher electricity prices under the proposed rule‘s policy 
scenario.  Excluding retirements, small entities gain about $195 million in electricity revenues 
over the base case, resulting in a net loss in electricity revenue of about $63 MM across all 
ownership types 
Federal Rules that May Overlap or Conflict with the Proposed Rule 
As noted above, the ―electric utility steam generating unit‖ source category includes 
those units that combust coal or oil for the purpose of generating electricity for sale and 
distribution through the national electric grid to the public.  Because of the definition provided in 
 10-8 
CAA section 112(a)(8), there should not be any EGU that is regulated under another CAA 
section 112 regulation. 
Combustion units that burn fossil fuels but do not meet the size or electric distribution 
requirements of CAA section 112(a)(8) will be covered under the CAA section 112(d) rules for 
Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Boilers (Area and Major Source Boiler NESHAPs), 
which were proposed on June 4, 2010 (75 FR 31896 and 75 FR 32006).  Combustion units that 
burn a solid waste as defined by the Administrator will be covered as solid waste incineration 
units under CAA section 129.  However, combustion units that burn a homogeneous solid waste 
and are qualifying units and are thus exempt from regulation under CAA section 129 under the 
provisions of CAA section 129(g)(1)(B) will be covered under the Utility NESHAP if they 
combust fossil fuel and meet the size and electric distribution requirements of CAA section 
112(a)(8); otherwise they will likely be covered under one of the Boiler NESHAPs (final action 
required by February 21, 2011). 
In 2007, EPA revised new source performance standards (NSPS) for EGUs having a heat 
input capacity greater than 250 million Btu per hour (40 CFR part 60, subpart Da).  The NSPS 
regulates emissions of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOX) 
from boilers constructed after June 2007.  EPA is currently working on additional revisions to 
the PM, SO2, and NOX emissions limits in subpart Da.  Those revisions will be proposed and 
promulgated along with the Utility NESHAP on March 16, 2011 and November 16, 2011, 
respectively.  Sources subject to the NSPS would also be subject to the Utility NESHAP because 
those rules regulate sources of HAP whereas the NSPS does not.  However, in developing the 
NESHAP for EGUs, EPA will minimize the monitoring requirements, testing requirements, and 
recordkeeping requirements to avoid duplicating requirements to the extent possible. 
On June 3, 2010 (75 FR 31514), EPA issued a final rule that establishes thresholds for 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that define when permits under the New Source Review 
Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and title V Operating Permit programs are 
required for new and existing industrial facilities (the Tailoring Rule).  The final rule addresses 
emissions of six GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).  As of 
January 2, 2011, large industrial sources, including power plants, are subject to permitting 
requirements for their GHG emissions if they otherwise are required to obtain a PSD or title V 
permit due to emissions of other air pollutants. 
 10-9 
On December 23, 2010, EPA announced a settlement agreement, subject to CAA section 
113(g) public comment, under which it would issue a proposed rule under CAA 111 (b) that 
includes standards of performance for GHGs for new and modified EGUs as well as issuing a 
proposed rule under CAA 111(d) that includes emissions guidelines for GHGs from existing 
EGUs.  The rules would establish NSPS for new and modified EGUs and emission guidelines for 
existing EGUs.  In addition to the NSPS requirements established for new and modified sources 
under section 111(b) of the CAA, for pollutants not regulated under other parts of the CAA, EPA 
must establish emission guidelines under CAA section 111(d) that States use to develop plans for 
reducing emissions from existing sources.  The guidelines include targets based on demonstrated 
controls, emission reductions, costs and expected timeframes for installation and compliance, 
and can be less stringent than the requirements imposed on new sources.  Under the agreement, 
EPA commits to issuing these proposed regulations by July 26, 2011 and, after considering any 
public comments received concerning the proposed rule(s), a final rule that takes final action 
with respect to the proposed rule(s) by May 26, 2012.  At this time the Agency has not 
formulated a final approach for regulating GHGs from EGUs; however, there is the potential that 
compliance with requirements of the NESHAP could result in some existing sources becoming 
new sources for purposes of the NSPS. 
On August 2, 2010 (75 FR 45210), EPA proposed a rule that would require 31 states and 
the District of Columbia (D.C.) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant 
emissions that contribute to ozone and fine particle pollution in other states (the Clean Air 
Transport Rule).  Specifically, the proposal would require reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions 
that cross state lines.  In response to a December 2008 court decision, the proposed Transport 
Rule would replace EPA‘s remanded 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).  The Transport 
Rule is expected to be finalized in July 2011.  To the extent that EGUs are located in the final set 
of states or D.C., they would be subject to the Transport Rule. 
Based on the findings from EPA‘s multi-year study of the Steam Electric Power 
Generating industry, EPA plans to revise the current effluent guidelines under the Clean Water 
Act (CWA) that apply to steam electric power plants.  EPA evaluated waste streams generated at 
power plants, including wastewaters from wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) air pollution 
control systems, fly ash and bottom ash handling, coal pile runoff, condenser cooling, equipment 
cleaning, and leachate from landfills and impoundments, but ultimately focused largely on 
discharges associated with coal ash handling operations and wastewater from FGD systems 
because these sources comprise a significant fraction of the pollutants discharged by steam 
 10-10 
electric power plants.  EPA is required by consent decree to propose revised effluent guidelines 
in July 2012 and to finalize the guidelines in January 2014. 
Section 316(b) of the CWA requires EPA to establish best technology available standards 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts from cooling water intake structures.  In developing 
these standards, EPA divided its effort into three rulemaking phases.  Phase I, for new EGU 
plants using cooling water, was promulgated on December 18, 2001 (66 FR 65255).  Minor 
revisions to the Phase I rule were finalized on June 19, 2003 (68 FR 36749).  Phase II, for 
existing EGU plants that use at least 50 million gallons per day (MGD) of cooling water, was 
promulgated on July 9, 2004 (69 FR 41576).  Those regulations were challenged, and several 
provisions of the Phase II rule were remanded on various grounds.  EPA suspended most of the 
rule in response to the remand (72 FR 37107, July 9, 2007).  On June 16, 2006 (71 FR 35005), 
EPA promulgated the Phase III regulations covering existing EGU plants using less than 50 
MGD of cooling water.  Those regulations also were challenged, and EPA requested, and was 
granted, a partial remand.  EPA plans to issue regulations that address both Phase II and III 
facilities.  EPA signed a settlement agreement that requires those regulations to be proposed by 
March 14, 2011, and promulgated by July 27, 2012. 
On June 21, 2010 (75 FR 35128), EPA proposed national rules for the management of 
coal combustion residuals under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  Coal 
combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash, are residues from the combustion of coal in 
power plants and are captured by pollution control technologies, like scrubbers.  The residues are 
disposed of in liquid form at surface impoundments and in solid form at landfills.  EGUs will be 
subject to these coal ash specific regulations when they are issued.  The date of final action has 
not yet been determined. 
1.4) Description of Significant Alternatives 
As required by RFA section 609(b), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Fairness Act (SBREFA), EPA conducted outreach to small entities and convened a Small 
Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panel (composed of EPA, the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)) to obtain the advice 
and recommendations of small entity representatives (SERs) that potentially would be subject to 
the requirements of the proposed Toxics Rule.  The outreach consisted of meeting with some 
organizations that represent and include small entities in their membership, including the 
American Public Power Association (APPA), Edison Electric Institute (EEI), the Utility Air 
Regulatory Group (UARG), the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), and 
 10-11 
the Coal Utilization Research Council (CURC).  As part of the SBAR Panel process, EPA 
conducted outreach with representatives from 18 various small entities that would be affected by 
the proposed Toxics Rule.  The SBAR Panel convened on October 27, 2010.  The Panel held a 
formal outreach meeting/teleconference with SERs on December 2, 2010.The final SBAR Panel 
report was completed on (February 16, 2011). 
The Panel‘s most significant findings and discussion with respect to each of these items 
are summarized below.  To read the full discussion of the Panel findings and recommendations, 
see Section 9 of the Panel Report. 
Number and Types of Entities Affected 
The estimated number of small entities that will be potentially subject to the Utility 
NESHAP includes 66 small State/local governments and 14 small non-government entities.  
These numbers reflect additions and deletions to the initial list of potentially impacted small 
entities as suggested by SERs as appropriate.  For an estimate of the type and number of small 
entities to which the proposed rule will apply, see Section 5 of the Panel Report.  The list of 
potentially affected small entities includes electricity generators.  SERs believe that this list 
should also include distribution cooperatives that own electricity generation and transmission 
(G&T) cooperatives and that qualify as small entities.  SERs stated that the Utility NESHAP will 
have a direct impact on all electric cooperatives generating and/or distributing coal-based power 
given the closely interwoven nature of the G&T cooperatives and the distribution cooperatives.  
The Panel acknowledges that small entity distribution cooperatives that own generation 
processes would be impacted in some way by the Utility NESHAP because generation processes 
will be regulated by the standards, but the extent to which small entity distribution cooperatives 
would be impacted is unclear without more detailed information on these entities. 
Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Other Compliance Requirements 
In general, SERs recommended that recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring 
requirements should be minimized and simplified to the maximum extent possible. 
EPA recommendations:  EPA panel members recommend that the Agency consider 
proposing alternative monitoring approaches (e.g., parameter monitoring in lieu of requiring the 
use of mercury continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS), sorbent traps, periodic stack 
testing, etc.) and consider requiring particulate matter (PM) CEMS only for the largest EGUs or 
allow use of PM CEMS as an alternative to conducting opacity monitoring and periodic 
emissions testing.  With respect to SERs‘ suggestion that if PM CEMS are required by the Utility 
NESHAP, opacity monitoring requirements of other Federal regulations should no longer apply, 
 10-12 
EPA panel members recommend that the Agency consider the available alternatives and options 
to the current opacity provisions. 
OMB recommendations:  OMB recommends that alternative monitoring approaches (e.g., 
parameter monitoring in lieu of requiring the use of mercury CEMS, sorbent traps, periodic stack 
testing) be proposed for small entities and that EPA propose PM CEMS only for the largest 
EGUs or propose allowing use of PM CEMS as an alternative to conducting opacity monitoring 
and periodic emissions testing. 
SBA recommendations:  SBA agrees that EPA should consider relevant factors identified 
by the SERs in developing this rulemaking, but it does not believe that the Panel has sufficient 
information to make recommendations beyond EPA‘s existing obligations under the RFA or 
Paperwork Reduction Act.  SBA agrees that these are flexibilities worthy of consideration, and 
perhaps proposal, but without information necessary to evaluate specific regulatory alternatives 
or the impacts of those decisions on particular small entities or small entities in general, SBA 
believes that the Panel can make no recommendations as to what specific regulatory options 
would ―accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any 
significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities.‖ 
10.1.4 Related Federal Rules 
SERs asked that EPA consider the impact of competing regulatory requirements and 
technologies when developing the Utility NESHAP.  EPA is currently working on revisions to 
the PM, SO2, and NOX emissions limit in subpart Da.  Sources subject to the NSPS would also 
be subject to the Utility NESHAP because those rules regulate sources of HAP whereas the 
NSPS does not. 
In June 2010, EPA issued a final rule that establishes thresholds for GHG emissions that 
define when permits under the New Source Review PSD and title V Operating Permit programs 
are required for new and existing industrial facilities (the Tailoring Rule).  Beginning in January 
2011, large industrial sources, including power plants, became subject to permitting requirements 
for their GHG emissions. 
On December 23, 2010, EPA announced a settlement agreement under which it would 
issue rules that will address GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants.  The rules would 
establish NSPS for new and modified EGUs and emission guidelines for existing EGUs.  Under 
the agreement, EPA commits to issuing proposed regulations by July 26, 2011 and final 
regulations by May 26, 2012. 
 10-13 
In August 2010, EPA proposed a rule that would require 31 states and the District of 
Columbia (D.C.) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that 
contribute to ozone and fine particle pollution in other states (the Transport Rule).  Specifically, 
the proposal would require reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions that cross state lines.  The 
Transport Rule is expected to be finalized in July 2011.  To the extent that EGUs are located in 
the final set of states or D.C., they would be subject to the Transport Rule.  SERs expressed 
concern regarding what the impact of controlling SO2 and NOX emissions as a result of 
complying with the Transport Rule will do to the level of CO emissions. 
Based on the findings from EPA‘s multi-year study of the Steam Electric Power 
Generating industry, EPA plans to revise the current effluent guidelines that apply to steam 
electric power plants.  Revised effluent guidelines will be proposed in July 2012 and finalized in 
January 2014. 
As required by section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), EPA established best 
technology available standards to minimize adverse environmental impacts from cooling water 
intake structures.  In developing these standards, EPA divided its effort into three rulemaking 
phases.  Phase I standards, for new EGU plants using cooling water, were finalized in June 2003.  
Phases II and III standards, which address existing EGU plants that use cooling water, were 
promulgated in July 2004 and June 2006, respectively.  Both regulations were challenged.  
Several provisions of the Phase II rule were remanded and EPA suspended most of the rule in 
response to the remand.  EPA requested, and was granted, a partial remand of the Phase III rule.  
EPA signed a settlement agreement that requires regulations for Phase II and III facilities to be 
proposed by March 14, 2011, and promulgated by July 27, 2012. 
In June 2010, EPA proposed national rules for the management of coal ash, which are 
residues from the combustion of coal in power plants that are captured by pollution control 
technologies, like scrubbers.  EGUs will be subject to these coal ash specific regulations when 
they are issued. 
SBA recommendations:  SBA agrees that EPA should consider relevant factors identified 
by the SERs in development of this rulemaking, including the extent to which other recently 
proposed or finalized regulatory obligations imposed by EPA will impact small entities or make 
compliance with this rulemaking more difficult.  SBA also agrees that EPA should always avoid 
duplication of requirements across programs.  However, SBA does not believe that the Panel has 
information necessary make recommendations beyond a restatement of EPA‘s existing 
obligations or to evaluate specific regulatory decisions and the impacts of those decisions on 
 10-14 
particular small entities or small entities in general.  Therefore, SBA believes that the Panel can 
make no recommendations as to what specific regulatory options would ―accomplish the stated 
objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities.‖ 
Panel recommendations:  Although the requirements of section 112 of the CAA direct 
EPA to establish NESHAP for both major and area sources of HAP and prescribe the processes 
by which the standards are developed, the Panel recommends that the Agency consider the 
various flexibilities within its discretion in developing the proposed standards.  The Panel 
recommends that the Agency investigate other potential surrogate pollutants for organic HAP in 
lieu of CO, given the NOX-CO relationship (i.e., when NOX emissions are reduced, CO 
emissions may increase).  In developing the NESHAP for EGUs, the Panel recommends that the 
Agency avoid duplicating requirements to the fullest extent possible in order to minimize 
unnecessary costs. 
10.1.5 Regulatory Flexibility Alternatives 
MACT Floors and Variability 
SERs raised four issues with respect to determining MACT floors and assessing 
variability:  (1) pollutant-by-pollutant ranking approach, (2) pollutants to be regulated, (3) floor 
determination methodology for existing units, and (4) assessment of emissions variability, 
including periods of startup and shutdown, and fuel, performance, and load variability.  A 
description of each of these issues along with the Panel recommendations is presented in 
succession below. 
SERs stated that the end result of determining a MACT floor for each HAP or HAP 
surrogate (a pollutant-by-pollutant approach) for each subcategory of sources is a set of MACT 
floors that do not represent the emission levels achieved by an actual, best-performing EGU.  
SERs believe that this methodology for setting MACT floors is inconsistent with the 
requirements of CAA section 112(d)(3).  It was suggested that MACT floors should be 
established using a facility-wide approach. 
EPA recommendation:  Consistent with EPA‘s legal interpretation, EPA panel members 
recommend that the Agency use the pollutant-by-pollutant approach for determining MACT 
standards for each HAP or HAP surrogate, while taking into account potential direct conflicts 
between pollution control technologies. 
 10-15 
There are concerns with respect to the suggestion that MACT floors should be 
established using a facility-wide approach.  Determining floors based on a facility-wide approach 
would lead to least common denominator floors – that is floors reflecting mediocre or no control, 
rather than performance which, for existing sources, is the average of what the best performing 
sources have achieved.  For example, if the best performing 12 percent of facilities for HAP 
metals did not control organics as well as a different 12 percent of facilities, the floor for 
organics and metals would end up not reflecting best performance.  This fact pattern has come up 
in every rule where EPA investigated a facility-wide approach.  See, e.g. 75 FR at 54999 (Sept. 
10, 2010).  Thus, utilizing the single-facility theory proffered by the stakeholders would result in 
EPA setting the standards at levels that would, for some pollutants, actually be based on 
emissions limitations achieved by the worst-performing unit, rather than the best-performing 
unit, as required by the statute.  Moreover, a single-facility approach would require EPA to make 
value judgments as to which pollutant reductions are most critical in working to identify the 
single facility that reduces emissions of HAP on an overall best-performing basis. 
OMB and SBA recommendation:  OMB and SBA recommend that in the proposed rule, 
EPA seek comment on reasonable alternative approaches to setting the MACT floor, which 
account for achievement in practice for control of all HAP. 
SERs stated their belief that the Utility NESHAP should be limited to mercury control 
only.  They explained that EPA has not determined that emissions of other HAP in the quantities 
emitted are detrimental to human health or the environment.  SERs continue to support EPA‘s 
2004 legal analysis that stated EPA believed it only had authority to set MACT standards for 
mercury under CAA section 112(d). 
EPA recommendation:  As to the comment that EPA should only regulate mercury from 
coal-fired EGUs and nickel from oil-fired EGUs consistent with the reasoning in the proposed 
NESHAP for these sources that was published on January 30, 2004, EPA panel members note 
that the Agency never finalized that proposed interpretation, and the Agency has determined that 
it must establish CAA section 112(d) standards for all HAP emitted from major source EGUs 
consistent with the statute and case law from the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  For 
these reasons, EPA rejects the proposed interpretation set forth in the 2004 proposed rule. 
OMB and SBA recommendation:  OMB and SBA recommend that in the proposed rule, 
EPA seek comment on the specific elements of the 2004 legal analysis and how subsequent court 
decisions affect that 2004 legal analysis. 
 10-16 
Panel Recommendation:  The Panel recommends that the analysis of impacts be able to 
distinguish the marginal costs and benefits of each required control technology, in order for the 
public to distinguish the impacts of regulating mercury from the impacts of regulating other 
HAPs.  It should be noted that EPA cannot, at this point, estimate monetized benefits for HAP 
reductions other than Hg. 
In addition, by focusing on one HAP at a time, SERs believe that the antagonistic effects 
a given HAP limit will have on other regulated pollutants are missed.  Because production of CO 
during the combustion process is inversely related to NOX production, it may be difficult to meet 
a CO limit if NOX reductions also are required. 
Panel Recommendation:  The Panel recommends that the Agency investigate other 
potential surrogate pollutants for organic HAP (e.g., PAH, formaldehyde).  The SERs‘ example 
of how a pollutant-by-pollutant approach could result in technical infeasibility with respect to 
CO and NOX may argue against using CO as the surrogate pollutant for organic HAP. 
SERs commented that the MACT floor for existing units should be determined using the 
entire inventory of EGUs and not using only the units for which EPA has test data. 
EPA recommendation:  The CAA requires the MACT floor for existing sources be based 
on the best performing sources.  Thus, EPA must be able to show that the best performing units 
are in fact used to establish the MACT floor.  To use the entire inventory of EGUs as the basis 
for determining the average of the best performing twelve percent of units, EPA must be 
confident that the EGUs for which data are available are the best performers.  EPA panel 
members recommend that the Agency establish the MACT floors using all the available ICR data 
that was received to the maximum extent possible consistent with the CAA requirements. 
OMB and SBA recommendations:  OMB and SBA recommend that EPA establish 
MACT standards that minimize the burden on small entities.  OMB and SBA also recommend 
that EPA consider, and present for comment, MACT floors based on the best performing 12 
percent, rather than the best 12 percent of the data EPA collected.  If EPA proposed the latter, 
OMB and SBA recommend that they clearly explain why the subset of sources for which they 
have data is representative of the entire set of sources. 
SERs asked that EPA consider establishing percent reduction limits as an alternative to 
complying with an emissions limit as a means of providing small entities flexibility in complying 
with the NESHAP in addition to providing a means of potentially accounting for variability.  
SERs expressed concern that periods of startup and shutdown could present problems with 
 10-17 
meeting emission limits and suggested that the emissions limits be based on a longer averaging 
time rather than basing limits on 3-run averages.  SERs stated that the three-day stack sampling 
required by EPA‘s ICR provides a snapshot of a unit‘s HAP emissions and is not indicative or 
representative of the unit‘s emissions over longer periods of time.  SERs pointed out that a 
critical question is how EPA plans to modify the stack emissions reported during the ICR to 
account for fuel, performance, and load variability.  One SER suggested that use of a longer-term 
rolling average (i.e., a 12-month minimum rolling average) is necessary in order to account for 
varying levels of mercury in fuel.  Additionally, one SER indicated that a de minimis exemption 
is a regulatory option/small entity flexibility that EPA should consider. 
EPA recommendations:  EPA is limited in its ability to establish percent reduction limits 
as an alternative to complying with an emissions limit.  Even assuming that EPA can establish 
percent reduction standards under CAA section 112, to establish such standards, emissions data 
for the inlet to the EGU and for the stack are necessary.  At this time, EPA does not have such 
data.  EPA panel members recommend that the Agency consider the inclusion of percent 
reduction standards given the legal constraints and the lack of data necessary to establish such 
standards.  Regarding the SERs‘ concerns with meeting emissions limits during periods of 
startup and shutdown, EPA panel members recommend that the Agency base the proposed 
emission limits on reasonable averaging times where appropriate.  In determining reasonable 
averaging times, EPA panel members recommend that in addition to considering performance 
during periods of startup and shutdown, the Agency also consider fuel and load variability.  In 
addition, EPA panel members recommend that the Agency use all data gathered through the ICR 
for EGUs that comprise the MACT floor, to the maximum extent possible consistent with the 
CAA requirements and as appropriate, in order to account for fuel, performance, and load 
variability.  With regard to one SER‘s request that a de minimis exemption be considered, EPA 
must establish standards for all HAP emitted from major sources consistent with CAA section 
112(d) and case law from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. 
Panel recommendations:  The Panel recommends that EPA propose provisions for 
emissions averaging between units at a facility and long averaging times to address startup, 
shutdown, and fuel variability for the proposed emissions limit and, further, that the Agency 
solicit comment on an appropriate averaging time.  The Panel recommends that EPA consider 
fuel variability when deriving the emissions standards.  The Panel recommends that the Agency 
evaluate whether establishing work practice requirements during periods of startup and shutdown 
would be consistent with CAA section 112(h) and investigate whether there are technical bases 
 10-18 
for establishing separate standards (e.g., work practices or subcategorization) for EGUs below a 
certain size and what that size threshold is. 
Subcategorization 
In general, SERs encouraged the broad use of subcategories.  SERs commented that EPA 
should consider subcategorizing EGUs based on fuel type, boiler type, duty cycle, and size.  
Some SERs requested that EPA consider establishing a subcategory for combined heat and 
power (CHP) units that meet the definition of EGU (i.e., generate enough electricity).  SERs 
explained that the duty cycles for some coal-fired EGUs are not primarily base-load, as in the 
past, but may alternate between operating as base-load units and peaking units.  Similar 
comments were not made with regard to consideration of base-load oil-fired EGUs and peaking 
oil-fired EGUs as separate subcategories. 
EPA recommendations:  EPA recognizes subcategorization may be necessary and we will 
consider whether subcategorization is reasonable in light of the data and other information 
obtained in response to the ICR to the utility industry and the information from the SERs.  SERs 
recommended that EPA consider adopting the following subcategories for EGUs: 
 Fuel type 
– North Dakota lignite 
– Gulf Coast lignite 
– Bituminous coal 
– Sub-bituminous coal 
– Blended bituminous/sub-bituminous coal 
– Powder River Basin coal 
– Illinois Basin coal 
 Boiler design 
– Units designed to burn coal 
– Units designed to burn oil 
– IGCC units 
– CHP units 
– Units designed to burn multiple fuels 
 10-19 
 Unit type 
– Fluidized bed 
– Pulverized coal 
– Wall-fired 
– Tangentially-fired 
 Duty cycle 
– Base-load oil-fired units 
– Peaking oil-fired units 
– Base-load coal-fired units 
– Coal-fired units that alternate operating as base-load and peaking 
 Boiler class 
– Small entity non-profit providers 
EPA and OMB recommendations:  EPA panel members and OMB acknowledge that it 
may not be practicable to adopt all of the proposed subcategories, as there may be substantial 
overlap between the groups.  EPA panel members and OMB recommend that EPA consider 
these subcategories and adopt a set of standards that is consistent with the CAA and which 
effectively reduces burden on small entities. 
SBA recommendations:  SBA agrees that EPA should consider various subcategorization 
options in developing this rulemaking, but it does not believe that the Panel has sufficient 
information to recommend a particular subcategorization option that would minimize the 
significant economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities.  While a large number of 
subcategories may serve to establish standards that minimize the economic impacts on some 
particular small entities, it could also disadvantage small entities that would otherwise be among 
the best performing 12 percent of a larger subcategory. 
Area Source Standards 
SERs suggested that EPA establish separate emission standards for EGUs located at area 
sources of HAP and that the standards be based on generally available control technology 
(GACT) as allowed under section 112(d)(5) of the CAA.  Specifically, SERs recommended that 
 10-20 
EPA establish management practice standards for natural area source EGUs as well as synthetic 
area source EGUs.1 
EPA recommendations:  EPA panel members recommend that the Agency consider a 
regulatory approach for EGUs at area sources of HAP based on GACT.  Further, EPA panel 
members recommend that the Agency consider establishing management practices for area 
source EGUs. 
OMB recommendations:  OMB recommends that EPA propose a regulatory approach for 
EGUs at area sources of HAP based on GACT and propose management practices for area 
source EGUs. 
SBA recommendations:  SBA agrees that EPA should consider the use of its authority to 
establish area sources standards for natural and synthetic area sources to the maximum extent 
permitted by statute, but does not believe that the Panel has sufficient information to recommend 
a particular regulatory option that would minimize the significant economic impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities. 
Work Practice Standards.  SERs recommended that EPA establish work practice 
standards for major source EGUs.  A work practice standard, instead of MACT emission limits, 
may be proposed if it can be justified under section 112(h) of the CAA that it is not feasible to 
prescribe or enforce an emission standard (i.e., the application of measurement methodology to a 
particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological and economic limitations).  
Specifically, SERs believe it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard for 
control of a HAP emitted at or below the detection limit of the method that was used to collect 
and analyze HAP emissions.  A number of HAP, including a large percentage of the dioxin/furan 
and non-dioxin organics measurements, are emitted at or below detection limits. 
EPA and OMB recommendation:  EPA panel members and OMB recommend that the 
Agency evaluate the availability of work practice standards, in particular with regards to HAP 
that are emitted at or below the detection limit. 
                                                 
1
 Based on the 2010 national inventory derived from the 2010 ICR data, there are 141 natural or synthetic area 
source units.  Of these 141 units, 23 units are owned in whole or in part by small entities (14 units are owned 
wholly by single small entities; 9 units are owned by a number of small entities holding small percentage 
ownership [less than 5%]). 
 10-21 
SBA recommendation:  SBA recommends that EPA propose work practices standards to 
the maximum extent permitted by statute.  However, the Panel does not have sufficient 
information to specify which work practices standards can be proposed. 
Health-Based Emissions Limits 
SERs commented that health based emission limits (HBELs) should be used to the 
maximum extent possible when facts support their use.  Specifically, SERs encouraged EPA to 
use its CAA section 112(d)(4) authority to set a HBEL for HCl based on its reference 
concentration for the entire EGU source category. 
EPA recommendation:  EPA panel members recommend that the Administrator consider 
her discretionary authority to propose a HBEL for acid gas HAP emissions as a regulatory 
flexibility option. 
OMB and SBA recommendations:  OMB and SBA recommend that in the proposed rule, 
EPA co-propose and seek comment on an HBEL for HAPs to the maximum extent permitted by 
statute, including, but not limited to, the acid gas HAP.  OMB and SBA recommend that in the 
proposal EPA explain their method for deriving these limits, along with sample calculations. 
Potential Adverse Economic Impacts 
SERs commented on a number of concerns they have with respect to small entities‘ 
ability to comply with the potential requirements of the Utility NESHAP.  SERs inquired as to 
EPA‘s authority to (1) move the effective date of the standards, (2) determine when 
implementation begins, (3) allow a phase-in of compliance, and (4) streamline the process for 
petitioning for a fourth year for purposes of complying with the standards.  SERs asked that EPA 
consider the implications of EGU reliability versus compliance with the Utility NESHAP when 
establishing the rule‘s requirements.  SERs expressed concern that, depending on the type and 
stringency of requirements, the regulations could be so expensive that they cause extensive plant 
retirements and job losses. 
SBA recommendation:  SBA recommends that EPA propose a streamlined process for 
granting a fourth year, including aiding small entities in gathering the information necessary to 
support such a petition, and recommends that EPA develop, in consultation with the Department 
of Defense and small entities affected by this rule, to develop the information necessary to 
support a recommendation under section 112(i)(4) of the CAA for consideration by the 
President. 
 10-22 
Panel recommendations:  The Panel recommends that the Agency weigh the potential 
burden of compliance requirements and consider various options for all regulated entities, 
especially small entities.  With respect to dates, EPA does not have the authority to move the 
effective date of the standards (see CAA section 112(d)(10)), to initially provide more than three 
years for compliance (see CAA section112(i)), or to allow a phase-in of compliance.  The Panel 
recommends that the Agency investigate the potential for streamlining the process for petitioning 
for a fourth year for purposes of compliance with the standards and consider the need to invoke 
the national security exemption under section 112(i)(4) of the CAA.  Additionally, the Panel 
recommends that EPA seek comment in the proposed rule on the potential adverse economic 
impacts of the rule for small entities and recommendations for mitigating or eliminating these 
adverse economic impacts on small entities. 
Concerns with the Small Business Advocacy Review Process 
SERs stated that they do not believe they were provided the opportunity for effective 
participation in the Federal regulatory process as required by SBREFA.  SERs indicated that they 
were not provided descriptions of significant alternatives to the proposed rule, differing 
compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available 
to small entities.  SERs further indicated that there was no pre-meeting to go over information on 
the rule, there was only one outreach meeting, and SERs were only provided 14 days to prepare 
written comments.  SERs had various suggestions including that EPA schedule additional panel 
meetings once the Agency has progressed further in its rulemaking preparation, that EPA 
consider starting over with the SBREFA process, and that EPA request an extension to allow 
time to (1) adequately analyze lessons learned in the Boiler MACT rule development process, (2) 
thoroughly analyze the emissions data, (3) continue to meet with utility industry representatives, 
and (4) consider the range of possible emission control options that would allow for 
implementation to take place such that the integrity of the Grid, the national economy, and 
national security will be protected. 
EPA recommendation:  EPA appreciates the SERs‘ concerns, but believes it has fulfilled 
its statutory obligations under SBREFA and has afforded SERs sufficient opportunity to suggest 
regulatory alternatives, and thus, makes no recommendations to address these concerns.  The 
time constraints of the small business advocacy review process with respect to the Utility 
NESHAP were explained at the beginning of the process.  That is, due to the regulatory schedule 
there could only be one SER outreach meeting.  The nature of the information to be provided 
was also outlined to the SERs at the start of the process.  EPA panel members believe they 
provided sufficient information to allow SERs to make suggestions concerning regulatory 
 10-23 
alternatives (e.g., regarding subcategories, HAP and HAP surrogates, monitoring requirements, 
control technologies potentially required to meet standards, CAA authorities to establish health-
based emission limits and work practice standards) as part of the small business advocacy review 
process, and the SERs have in fact made many productive suggestions EPA will seriously 
consider as part of the rulemaking process. 
OMB recommendation:  Although OMB understands the time constraints imposed on 
this rulemaking process, we recommend that once EPA has drafted a set of emissions limits for 
EGUs, they convene another meeting with the SERs to gather insight on the feasibility and 
achievability of those limits for small entities.  To the extent feasible, we recommend this 
meeting take place before the proposal is issued. 
SBA recommendations:  SBA agrees with the concerns raised by the SERs in their 
comments about the adequacy of the information provided to the Panel and the SERs and about 
the schedule for the Panel.  SBA believes that more time is necessary for EPA to develop 
regulatory options and to share them with the SERs, so that the SERs could provide a more 
informed comment and better inform the Panel‘s recommendations. 
SBA recommends that EPA request an extension of the regulatory deadlines imposed by 
the consent decree.  The extension should provide enough time for EPA to: 
 Analyze fully the results of the ICR and other data necessary to understand the 
emissions characteristics of the regulated entities; 
 Develop a robust range of specific regulatory options; 
 Consult with the SERs and provide an additional opportunity for the SERs to provide 
input on the regulatory options; and 
 Allow for the full interagency review required by Executive Order 12866. 
10.2 Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) Analysis 
Title II of the UMRA of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) (UMRA) establishes requirements for 
federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on state, local, and Tribal 
governments and the private sector.  Under Section 202 of the UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1532, EPA 
generally must prepare a written statement, including a cost-benefit analysis, for any proposed or 
final rule that ―includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more ... in 
 10-24 
any one year.‖  A ―Federal mandate‖ is defined under Section 421(6), 2 U.S.C. 658(6), to include 
a ―Federal intergovernmental mandate‖ and a ―Federal private sector mandate.‖  A ―Federal 
intergovernmental mandate,‖ in turn, is defined to include a regulation that ―would impose an 
enforceable duty upon State, Local, or Tribal governments,‖ Section 421(5)(A)(i), 2 U.S.C. 
658(5)(A)(i), except for, among other things, a duty that is ―a condition of Federal assistance,‖ 
Section 421(5)(A)(i)(I).  A ―Federal private sector mandate‖ includes a regulation that ―would 
impose an enforceable duty upon the private sector,‖ with certain exceptions, Section 421(7)(A), 
2 U.S.C. 658(7)(A). 
Before promulgating an EPA rule for which a written statement is needed under Section 
202 of the UMRA, Section 205, 2 U.S.C. 1535, of the UMRA generally requires EPA to identify 
and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and adopt the least costly, most 
cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule.  Moreover, 
section 205 allows EPA to adopt an alternative other than the least costly, most cost-effective or 
least burdensome alternative if the Administrator publishes an explanation why that alternative 
was not adopted. 
In a manner consistent with the intergovernmental consultation provisions of Section 204 
of the UMRA, EPA carried out consultations with the governmental entities affected by this rule. 
EPA held meetings with states and Tribal representatives in which the Agency presented its plan 
to develop a proposal and provided opportunities for participants to provide input as part of the 
rulemaking process. EPA has also analyzed the economic impacts of the proposed Toxics Rule 
on government entities and this section presents the results of that analysis.  This analysis does 
not examine potential indirect economic impacts associated with the proposed rule, such as 
employment effects in industries providing fuel and pollution control equipment, or the potential 
effects of electricity price increases on industries and households. 
Identification of Affected Government Entities 
Using Ventyx data, EPA identified state- and municipality-owned utilities and 
subdivisions that would be affected by the proposed rule.  EPA then used IPM parsed outputs to 
associate these entities with individual generating units.  The analysis focused only on EGUs 
affected by the proposed rule, which includes units burning coal, oil, petroleum coke, or waste 
coal as the primary fuel, and excludes any combustion turbine units.  Entities that did not own at 
least one unit with a generating capacity of greater than 25 MW were also removed from the 
dataset because of their exemption from the rule. Finally, government entities for which IPM 
does not project generation in 2015 under the base case were also exempted from this analysis, 
 10-25 
because they are not projected to be operating and thus will not face the costs of compliance with 
the proposed rule.  Based on this, EPA identified 96 state, municipal and sub-divisions affiliated 
with 169 electric generating units that are potentially affected by the proposed Toxics Rule. 
Compliance Cost Impacts 
After identifying the potentially affected government entities, EPA estimated the impact 
of the proposed rule in 2015 based on the following: 
 total impacts of compliance on government entities and 
 ratio of government entity impacts to revenues from electricity generation. 
 
Methodology for Estimating Impacts of the Toxics Rule on Government Entities 
EPA estimated compliance costs of the proposed Toxics Rulemaking as follows: 
 CCompliance = Δ COperating+Capital + Δ CFuel + Δ R 
where C represents a component of cost as labeled, and Δ R represents the retail value of change 
in electricity generation, calculated as the difference in revenues between the base case and the 
Toxics Rule. 
Based on this formula, compliance costs for a given government entity could either be 
positive or negative (i.e., cost savings) based on their compliance choices and market conditions.  
Under the Toxics Rule, some units will forgo some level of electricity generation (and thus 
revenues) to comply and this impact will be lessened on those entities by the projected increase 
in electricity prices under the MACT scenario.  On the other hand, some units may increase 
electricity generation, and coupled with the increase in electricity prices, will see an increase in 
electricity revenues resulting in lower net compliance costs.  If entities are able to increase 
revenue more than an increase in retrofit and fuel costs, ultimately they will have negative net 
compliance costs (or savings).  Because this analysis evaluates the total costs as a sum of the 
costs associated with compliance choices as well as changes in electricity revenues, it captures 
savings or gains such as those described.  As a result, what EPA describes as a cost is really 
more of a measure of the net economic impact of the rule on government entities. 
For this analysis, EPA used unit-level IPM parsed outputs to estimate costs based on the 
parameters above.  These impacts were then aggregated for each government entity, adjusting for 
ownership share.  Compliance cost estimates were based on the following: changes in capital and 
 10-26 
operating costs, change in fuel costs, and change in electricity generation revenues under the 
proposed rule relative to the base case.  These components of compliance cost were estimated as 
follows: 
(1) Capital and operating costs: Using the IPM parsed outputs for the base case and the 
Toxics Rule policy case, EPA identified units that install control technology under the 
proposed rule and the technology installed.  The equations for calculating operating and 
capital costs were adopted from EPA‘s version of IPM (version 4.10).  The model 
calculates the capital cost (in $/MW); the fixed operation and maintenance (O&M) cost 
(in $/MW-year); and the variable O&M cost (in $/MWh) 
 
(2) Fuel costs: Fuel costs were estimated by multiplying fuel input (MMBtu) by region and 
fuel prices ($/MMBtu) from IPM.  The change in fuel expenditures under the Toxics 
Rule was then estimated by taking the difference in fuel costs between the Toxics Rule 
and the base case. 
 
(3) Value of electricity generated:  EPA estimated electricity generation by first estimating 
the unit capacity factor and maximum fuel capacity.  Unit capacity factor was estimated 
by dividing fuel input (MMBtu) by maximum fuel capacity (MMBtu).  The maximum 
fuel capacity was estimated by multiplying capacity (MW) * 8,760 operating hours * heat 
rate (MMBtu/MWh).  The value of electricity generated was then estimated by 
multiplying capacity (MW) * capacity factor * 8,760 * regional-adjusted retail electricity 
price ($/MWh). 
Results 
As was done for the small entities analysis, EPA assessed the economic and financial 
impacts of the rule using the ratio of compliance costs to the value of revenues from electricity 
generation, and our results focus on those entities for which this measure could be greater than 1 
percent or 3 percent of base revenues. EPA projects that 55 government entities will have 
compliance costs greater than 1 percent of base generation revenue in 2015, and 37 may 
experience compliance costs greater than 3 percent of base revenues.  Also, one government 
entity is estimated to have all of its affected units retire.  Overall, 17 units owned by government 
entities retire.  It is also worth noting that two-thirds of the net compliance costs shown above are 
due to lost profits from retirements.  More than half of those lost profits arise from retiring two 
large units, according to EPA modeling. 
The separate components of the annualized costs to government entities under the 
proposed Toxics Rule are summarized in Table 10-3 below.  The most significant components of 
 10-27 
incremental costs to these entities are the increased capital and operating costs, followed by 
changes in electricity revenues.

The number of potentially affected government entities by ownership type and potential 
impacts of the Toxics Rule are summarized in Table 10-4.  All costs are reported in $2007.  EPA 
estimated the annualized net compliance cost to government entities to be approximately $571 
million in 2015.

Capital and operating costs increase over all ownership types.  All ownership types, 
however, also experience a net gain in electricity revenue, mainly due to higher electricity prices 
under the policy case.  As described in the small entity analysis, the change in electricity revenue 
takes into account both the profit lost from units that do not operate under the policy case and the 
difference in revenue for operating units under the policy case.  According to EPA modeling, an 
estimated 2.1 GW of electricity generation is estimated to be uneconomical to operate under the 
policy case, accounting for about $416 MM in lost profits
1
.  On the other hand, many operating 
units actually increase their electricity revenue due to higher electricity prices under the proposed 
rule‘s policy scenario.  Excluding retirements, government entities gain about $632 MM in 
electricity revenue over the base case, resulting in a net gain in electricity revenue of about $216 
MM across all ownership types. 
10.3 Paperwork Reduction Act 
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule will be submitted for 
approval to the OMB under the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.  An ICR document has been 
prepared by EPA (ICR No. 2028.05). 
The information requirements are based on notification, recordkeeping, and reporting 
requirements in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, subpart A), which are 
mandatory for all operators subject to national emission standards.  These recordkeeping and 
reporting requirements are specifically authorized by CAA section 114 (42 U.S.C. 7414).  All 
information submitted to EPA pursuant to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for 
which a claim of confidentiality is made is safeguarded according to Agency policies set forth in 
40 CFR part 2, subpart B. 
This proposed rule would require maintenance inspections of the control devices but 
would not require any notifications or reports beyond those required by the General Provisions.  
The recordkeeping requirements require only the specific information needed to determine 
compliance. 
The annual monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping burden for this collection (averaged 
over the first 3 years after the effective date of the standards) is estimated to be $49.1 million.  
This includes 329,605 labor hours per year at a total labor cost of 27.0 million per year, and total 
non-labor capital costs of $22.1 million per year.  This estimate includes initial and annual 
performance test, semiannual excess emission reports, maintenance inspections, developing a

monitoring plan, notifications, and recordkeeping.  The total burden for the Federal government 
(averaged over the first 3 years after the effective date of the standard) is estimated to be 18,039 
hours per year at a total labor cost of $877 million per year.  All burden estimates are in 2007 
dollars. 
Burden means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to 
generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency.  This 
includes the time needed to review instructions; develop, acquire, install, and utilize technology 
and systems for the purposes of collecting, validating, and verifying information, processing and 
maintaining information, and disclosing and providing information; adjust the existing ways to 
comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements; train personnel to be able 
to respond to a collection of information; search data sources; complete and review the collection 
of information; and transmit or otherwise disclose the information. 
An Agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.  The OMB 
control numbers for our regulations are listed in 40 CFR part 9 and 48 CFR chapter 15. 
To comment on EPA‘s need for this information, the accuracy of the provided burden 
estimates, and any suggested methods for minimizing respondent burden, including the use of 
automated collection techniques, EPA has established a public docket for this proposed rule, 
which includes this ICR, under the Docket ID numbers for the utility NESHAP and NSPS.  
Submit any comments related to the ICR to EPA and OMB.  The final rule will respond to any

Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) applies to any rule that:  (1) is 
determined to be ―economically significant‖ as defined under EO 12866, and (2) concerns an 
environmental health or safety risk that EPA has reason to believe may have a disproportionate 
effect on children.  If the regulatory action meets both criteria, the Agency must evaluate the 
environmental health or safety effects of this planned rule on children, and explain why this 
planned regulation is preferable to other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives 
considered by the Agency. 
This proposed rule is subject to EO 13045 because it is an economically significant 
regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866, and we believe that the action concerns 
an environmental health risk which may have a disproportionate impact on children. Although 
 10-30 
this proposed rule is based on technology performance, the standards are designed to protect 
against hazards to public health with an adequate margin of safety as described in Section XX 
―Hazard to Public Health of Adverse Environmental Effect‖ in the preamble. The protection 
offered by this rule may be especially important for children, especially the developing fetus. As 
referenced in Chapter 5 of the RIA, ―Consideration of Health Risks to Children and 
Environmental Justice Communities‖ children are more vulnerable than adults to many HAPs 
emitted by EGUs due to differential behavior patterns and physiology.  These unique 
susceptibilities were carefully considered in a number of different ways in the analyses 
associated with this rulemaking, and are summarized in Chapter 5 of the RIA. 
The public is invited to submit comments or identify peer-reviewed studies and data that 
assess effects of early life exposure to this proposed rule. 
10.5 Executive Order 13132, Federalism 
Under EO 13132, EPA may not issue an action that has federalism implications, that 
imposes substantial direct compliance costs, and that is not required by statute, unless the Federal 
government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs incurred by State 
and local governments, or EPA consults with State and local officials early in the process of 
developing the proposed action. 
EPA has concluded that this action may have federalism implications, because it may 
impose substantial direct compliance costs on State or local governments, and the Federal 
government will not provide the funds necessary to pay those costs.  Accordingly, EPA provides 
the following federalism summary impact statement as required by section 6(b) of EO 13132. 
Based on the estimates in EPA‘s RIA for today‘s proposed rule, the proposed regulatory 
option, if promulgated, may have federalism implications because the option may impose 
approximately $666.3 million in annual direct compliance costs on an estimated 97 State or local 
governments.  Specifically, we estimate that there are 81 municipalities, 5 States, and 11 political 
subdivisions (i.e., a public district with territorial boundaries embracing an area wider than a 
single municipality and frequently covering more than one county for the purpose of generating, 
transmitting and distributing electric energy) that may be directly impacted by today‘s proposed 
rule.  Responses to EPA‘s 2010 ICR were used to estimate the nationwide number of potentially 
impacted State or local governments.  As previously explained, this 2010 survey was submitted 
to all coal- and oil-fired EGUs listed in the 2007 version of DOE/EIA‘s ―Annual Electric 
Generator Report,‖ and ―Power Plant Operations Report.‖ 
 10-31 
EPA consulted with State and local officials in the process of developing the proposed 
rule to permit them to have meaningful and timely input into its development.  EPA met with 10 
national organizations representing State and local elected officials to provide general 
background on the proposal, answer questions, and solicit input from State/local governments.  
The UMRA discussion in the preamble and the RIA includes a description of the consultation. 
In the spirit of EO 13132, and consistent with EPA policy to promote communications 
between EPA and State and local governments, EPA specifically solicits comment on this 
proposed action from State and local officials. 
10.6 Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments 
Subject to EO 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) EPA may not issue a regulation 
that has Tribal implications, that imposes substantial direct compliance costs, and that is not 
required by statute, unless the Federal government provides the funds necessary to pay the direct 
compliance costs incurred by Tribal governments, or EPA consults with Tribal officials early in 
the process of developing the proposed regulation and develops a Tribal summary impact 
statement.  EO 13175 requires EPA to develop an accountable process to ensure ―meaningful 
and timely input by tribal officials in the development of regulatory policies that have tribal 
implications.‖ 
EPA has concluded that this action may have Tribal implications.  However, it will 
neither impose substantial direct compliance costs on Tribal governments, nor preempt Tribal 
law.  This proposed rule would impose requirements on owners and operators of EGUs.  EPA is 
aware of three coal-fired EGUs located in Indian Country but is not aware of any EGUs owned 
or operated by tribal entities. 
EPA offered consultation with Tribal officials early in the process of developing this 
proposed regulation to permit them to have meaningful and timely input into its development.  
Consultation letters were sent to 584 Tribal leaders.  The letters provided information regarding 
EPA‘s development of NESHAP for EGUs and offered consultation.  Three consultation 
meetings were held on December 7, 2011 with the Upper Sioux Community of Minnesota; 
December 13 with Moapa Band of Paiutes, Forest County Potawatomi, Standing Rock Sioux 
Tribal Council, Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa; January 5, 2011 with the Forest County 
Potawatomi, and a representative from the National Tribal Air Association.  In these meetings, 
EPA presented the authority under the CAA used to develop these rules, and an overview of the 
industry and the industrial processes that have the potential for regulation.  Tribes expressed 
 10-32 
concerns about the impact of Utility Units on the reservations.  Particularly, they were concerned 
about potential Hg deposition and the impact on the water resources of the Tribes, with 
particularly concern about the impact on subsistence lifestyles for fishing communities, the 
cultural impact of impaired water quality for ceremonial purposes, and the economic impact on 
tourism.  In light of these concerns, the tribes expressed interested in an expedited 
implementation of the rule, they expressed concerns about how the Agency would consider 
variability in setting the standards, use Tribal-specific fish consumption data from the Tribes in 
our assessments, they were not supportive of using work practice standards as part of the rule, 
and asked the Agency to consider going beyond the floor to offer more protection for the Tribal 
communities.  A more specific list of comments can be found in the Docket. 
In addition, to these consultations, EPA also conducted outreach on this rule through 
presentations at the National Tribal Forum in Milwaukee, WI, and on National Tribal Air 
Association calls.  EPA specifically requested tribal data that could support the appropriate and 
necessary analyses and the RIA for this rule.  We will also hold additional meetings with Tribal 
environmental staff to inform them of the content of this proposal as wells as provide additional 
consultation with Tribal elected officials where it is appropriate. 
EPA specifically solicits additional comment on this proposed rule from Tribal officials. 
10.7 Environmental Justice 
Our discussion of environmental justice and distributional impacts associated with the 
proposed Toxics Rule is found in Appendix C, the appendix to Chapter 6 of the benefits analysis. 
10.8 Statement of Energy Effects 
Our analysis to comply with EO 13211 (Statement of Energy Effects) can be found in 
section 8.15 of this RIA.

COMPARISON OF BENEFITS AND COSTS 
11.1 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
The estimated social costs to implement the proposed Toxics Rule, as described earlier in 
this document, are approximately $10.9 billion annually for 2016 (2007 dollars).  Thus, the net 
benefits (social benefits minus social costs) of the program in 2016 are approximately $48 to 130 
+ B billion or $42 to 120 + B billion annually (2007 dollars, based on a discount rate of 3 percent 
and 7 percent for the benefits, respectively and rounded to three significant figures).  (B 
represents the sum of all unquantified benefits and disbenefits of the regulation.)  Therefore, 
implementation of this rule is expected, based purely on economic efficiency criteria, to provide 
society with a significant net gain in social welfare, even given the limited set of health and 
environmental effects we were able to quantify.  Addition of acidification-, and eutrophication-
related impacts would likely increase the net benefits of the rule.  Table 11-1 presents a summary 
of the benefits, costs, and net benefits of the proposed Toxics rule. 
Air quality modeling was not conducted for options other than that for the MACT floor 
for each HAP or its surrogate.  Table 11-2 below presents the social costs and health benefits, 
including net social benefit, of the proposed rule. 
As with any complex analysis of this scope, there are several uncertainties inherent in the 
final estimate of benefits and costs that are described fully in Chapters 5, 6, and 8.

  Estimates rounded to two significant figures and represent annualized benefits and costs anticipated for the year

b
 Note that costs are the annualized total social costs of reducing HAP  in 2016.The social costs are estimated using 
the Multimarket Model.  More information on the social costs and how they are estimated can be found in Chapter 
9 and Appendix F of this RIA. 
c 
Total benefits are comprised primarily of monetized PM-related health benefits.  The reduction in premature 
fatalities each year accounts for over 90 percent of total monetized benefits.  Benefits in this table are nationwide 
and are associated with directly emitted PM2.5, NOx, SO2, and Hg reductions.  The estimate of social benefits also 
includes CO2-related benefits calculated using the social cost of carbon, discussed further in chapter 6. 
d
 Not all possible benefits or disbenefits are quantified and monetized in this analysis.  B is the sum of all 
unquantified benefits and disbenefits.  Data limitations prevented us from quantifying these endpoints, and as 
such, these benefits are inherently more uncertain than those benefits that we were able to quantify. Estimates here 
are subject to uncertainties discussed further in the body of the document.  Potential benefit categories that have 
not been quantified and monetized are listed in Table 1-4. 
e
 Valuation assumes discounting over the SAB-recommended 20-year segmented lag structure.  Results reflect the 
use of 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates consistent with EPA and OMB guidelines for preparing economic 
analyses (EPA, 2000; OMB, 2003). 
f
 Net benefits are rounded to three significant figures.  Columnar totals may not sum due to rounding 
* The 2016 compliance costs (incremental to the base case) for the proposed Toxics Rule are approximately $10.9 
billion in 2007 dollars.
