Executive Summary 
In November 2006, Colorado Governor Bill Owens petitioned the Secretary of Agriculture to 
undertake rule-making requesting certain management direction and flexibility for National 
Forest System (NFS) roadless areas in Colorado. In April 2007, Governor Ritter resubmitted the 
petition with a substantive letter of transmittal, and in June 2007, the State and the U.S. Forest 
Service presented the petition with some modifications to the Department of Agriculture’s 
Roadless Area Conservation National Advisory Committee (RACNAC). In August 2007, based 
on the advisory committee’s review and report, the Secretary of Agriculture accepted the State’s 
petition and directed the Forest Service to work in cooperation with the State of Colorado to 
initiate rulemaking. Based on the petition, the State and the Forest Service collaboratively 
developed the rulemaking (regulatory) language for a proposed Colorado Roadless Rule that 
would govern management of roadless areas on NFS lands in Colorado. The draft rule was 
published July 25, 2008 (FR Vol 73, No. 144, p. 43544) with solicitation of public comment on 
the proposed rule as well as the draft Environmental Impact Statement (draft EIS). Based on 
public comment and additional meetings with RACNAC and the State, the provisions of a 
proposed rule have been revised, in preparation for the publication of a revised version of a 
Colorado Roadless rule. 
This report summarizes the regulatory impact analysis for the proposed Colorado Roadless Rule 
(proposed rule) as directed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 issued September 30, 1993,  on 
Regulatory Planning and Review. These executive orders address regulatory planning and review 
and require that agencies conduct a regulatory analysis for economically significant regulatory 
actions. Significant regulatory actions are those that have an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more or adversely affect the economy or economic sectors. Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars as well as guidance regarding E.O. 12866 indicate 
that regulatory impact analysis should include benefit cost analysis and an assessment of 
distributional effectsTotal annual output associated with oil, gas, and coal production in the 
affected areas is projected to be approximately $970 million under the proposed rule, compared 
to approximately $1,030 million under baseline conditions, implying the annual impact of the 
proposed rule is estimated to be a decrease of approximately $60 million for energy mineral 
sectors. Due to the potential magnitude of economic impacts and the level of interest in 
inventoried roadless area management, the proposed rule is designated as significant and is 
therefore subject to E.O. 12866. 
 
 
The proposed rule is programmatic in nature and intended to guide future development of 
proposed actions in roadless areas. The proposed rule is intended to provide greater management 
flexibility under certain circumstances to address unique and local land management challenges, 
while continuing to conserve roadless values and characteristics. Increased management 
flexibility is primarily needed to reduce hazardous fuels and large-scale insect and disease 
outbreaks, to allow access to coal reserves in the North Fork coal mining areas, and to allow 
access to future utility and water conveyances, while continuing to conserve roadless area values 
and characteristics. This proposal does not authorize the implementation of any ground-
disturbing activities, but rather it describes circumstances under which certain activities may be 
allowed or restricted in roadless areas. Before authorizing land use activities in roadless areas, 
the Forest Service must complete a more detailed and site-specific environmental analysis 
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations at 
2 
 
40 CFR 1500-1508. Because the proposed rule does not prescribe site-specific activities, it is 
difficult to predict changes in benefits under the different alternatives. It should also be 
emphasized that the types of benefits derived from uses of roadless areas in Colorado are far 
ranging and include a number of non-market and non-use benefit categories. As a consequence, 
benefits are discussed qualitatively in many sections of this report. 
 
Details about the environmental effects of the proposed rule can be found in the revised draft 
environmental impact statement (RDEIS) for the proposed rule (USDA Forest Service, 2010), as 
well as ‘specialist’ reports developed to support the effects summarized in the RDEIS. The 
environmental effects for a number of resources are not significantly different across alternatives 
and are therefore not discussed in detail in this regulatory impact analysis; the reader is again 
referred to the RDEIS for details about these resource areas. The following changes have 
occurred since the release of the initial DEIS in 2008: 
 The No Action Alternative has changed from Alternative 1 (2001 rule) to Alternative 3 
(Forest Plan Direction). In August 2008, after the DEIS was released, the Wyoming District 
Court set aside and enjoined the 2001 Roadless Rule. Colorado is under the Wyoming 
Court’s ruling, thus the consequences of taking no action have changed.  In the revised DEIS 
the “no action” or baseline conditions means that IRAs in Colorado will be managed 
according to direction set forth in the applicable forest plan (alternative 3). 
 Effective date of Alternative 1 (2001 rule) is the effective date of the Colorado rule, 
 Changes in the language of the proposed Colorado Roadless rule include: 
 Changes in roadless area boundaries: 1,000 acres from the Indian Peaks Adjacent Area 
Roadless Area (now Wilderness) are removed.  A net increase of approximately 155,000 
acres to be managed as Colorado Roadless Areas (CRAs) under alternative 2; 
 New requirements regarding regional forester responsibilities for making tree-cutting 
determinations; 
 The proposed rule uses the term Community Protection Zone (CPZ) instead of Wildland 
Urban Interface (WUI) to describe an area one-half mile from the boundary of an at-risk 
community or an area within one and one-half miles from the boundary of an at-risk 
community where any land has a sustained steep slope that creates the potential for 
wildfire behavior endangering the at-risk community; or has a geographic feature that 
aids in creating an effective fire break. Within the CPZ, tree-cutting, sale or removal is 
allowed to reduce the wildfire hazard to an at-risk community or municipal water 
supply system. Tree-cutting outside of the CPZ is allowed to reduce the wildfire threat 
to a municipal water supply system only. A temporary road can only be constructed 
within the first ½ mile of the CPZ to facilitate the projects (unlike previous allowances 
for construction within 1.5 miles); 
 Tree-cutting, sale or removal in Colorado Roadless Areas must maintain or improve one 
or more roadless area characteristics; 
 Tree-cutting, sale or removal is allowed within the CPZ or outside of the CPZ with 
Regional Forester concurrence where needed to suppress or prevent an insect or disease 
epidemic once four factors have been considered; 
 Linear Construction Zones (LCZs) and linear facilities have been defined and addressed 
as a temporary linear area of surface disturbance over 50-inches wide that is used for 
motorized transport by vehicles or construction equipment to install a linear facility. The 
proposed Colorado Roadless Rule generally prohibits the construction of LCZs unless 
3 
 
the construction relates to a water conveyance structure, electrical power line or 
telecommunication line or oil and gas pipeline; 
 Road construction in support of water conveyance structures, including reservoirs, is 
only allowed for those that have a pre-existing water court decree as of the effective date 
of the Rule; 
 The North Fork Coal Mining area exception for road construction has changed.  
Approximately 9,000 acres of the Currant Creek CRA remains as CRA acreage but no 
longer allows temporary roads; 
 Any road construction or LCZ construction must not diminish existing native cutthroat 
trout habitat; 
 The Colorado Roadless Rule has identified Colorado Roadless Areas upper tier acres 
and provided a set of draft acreage and prohibitions for these acres for public comment.  
Tree-cutting, sale or removal is prohibited unless the Regional Forester determines it is 
needed incidental to the implementation of a management activity not otherwise 
prohibited by the rule. Road construction or road reconstruction is prohibited unless it is 
needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights or as provided for by statute or 
treaty. Alternative 2 identifies 257,400 upper tier acres with an additional 304,900 acres 
being considered as upper tier; and 
 The term “long-term temporary road” has been eliminated from the Colorado Roadless 
Rule. 
A fourth alternative (Alternative 4) has been added with the same prohibitions and exceptions as 
alternative 2 but with a larger number of upper tier acres (2,614,200) within the CRAs. 
Methods and Assumptions 
 
This report summarizes the benefits, costs, and distributional effects of four alternatives referred 
to as follows: alternative 1 - the 2001 Roadless Rule (2001 rule), alternative 2 - the proposed 
Colorado Roadless rule (proposed rule), and alternative 3 – forest plan direction (forest plans; no 
action); and alternative 4 – proposed Colorado Roadless rule with additional public proposed 
upper tier acreage. 
 
National Forest System (NFS) lands provide a variety of goods and services to the American 
public. Use of the national forests (NFs) and grasslands for both commodities and amenity 
services varies over time in response to changing market conditions, consumer preferences, and 
other factors. In general, the proposed rule indirectly affects the provision of those commodities 
and services (including non-use values) by altering the circumstances under which road 
construction and reconstruction (roading), as well as tree-cutting, are permitted in roadless areas 
on NFS lands in Colorado. 
The State’s original petition also requested that the rulemaking process use the most updated 
roadless boundaries and that all existing congressionally designated areas (e.g., wilderness) be 
removed from roadless areas for all alternatives. In addition, the Colorado roadless areas (CRAs) 
under the proposed rule exclude ski areas and current inventoried roadless areas that do not meet 
roadless criteria (referred to as substantially altered areas), but include new roadless acres that 
meet roadless criteria. As a consequence of these adjustments, inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) 
under the 2001 rule and the forest plan alternative are approximately 4.24 million acres, while 
Colorado roadless areas (CRAs) under the revised proposed rule cover approximately 4.19 
4 
 
million acres. The IRAs described in the original environmental analysis for the 2001 rule 
covered approximately 4.43 million acres.  
For the purpose of regulatory impact analysis, Alternative 3 (Forest Plans) represents baseline 
conditions or goods and services provided by NFS lands in the near future in the absence of the 
proposed rule. 
Because the proposed rule does not prescribe site-specific activities, it is difficult to predict the 
benefits and costs of the different alternatives. In addition, the types of benefits derived from 
roadless characteristics and the uses of roadless areas are far ranging and include a number of 
non-market and non-use benefit categories that are difficult to measure in monetary terms. As a 
consequence, benefits are not monetized, nor are net present values or benefit cost ratios 
estimated. Instead, increases and/or losses in benefits are discussed separately for each resource 
area in a quantitative or qualitative way. Benefits and costs are organized and discussed in the 
context of local land management challenges or concerns (“local challenges”) and “roadless 
characteristics” in an effort to remain consistent with the overall purpose of the proposed rule, 
recognizing that benefits associated with local challenges may trigger or overlap with benefits 
associated with roadless characteristics in some cases (e.g., forest health). Access and 
designations for motorized versus non-motorized recreation is a topic raised in comments during 
scoping, however, the proposed rule does not provide direction on where and when off-highway 
vehicle (OHV) use would be permissible other than roads constructed pursuant to the rule are 
closed to motor vehicles, including OHVs, unless specifically used for the purpose for which the 
road was built.  Other travel planning-related actions should be addressed through travel 
management planning and individual land management plans. 
 
The assessment of benefits and costs begins by distinguishing between the creation of potential 
opportunities and the projection of reasonably foreseeable activities. Potential opportunities for 
generating goods and services are affected by the extent to which activities are permitted in 
roadless areas under each alternative. Projections of reasonable foreseeable activities take into 
account area-specific data and evidence regarding resource utilization and development trends, 
location of resources, and other factors affecting the likelihood that land will be used for specific 
uses. This information is aggregated into assumptions about reasonably foreseeable flows of 
goods (e.g., coal, oil and gas production), services (e.g., reduction of risks from wildfire in the 
wildland urban interface), and resource utilization and then used to project activity levels (tree-
cutting, roading) for each alternative over a 15 year time period. Projected activity levels can 
also be used as indicators of potential changes in benefits derived from roadless characteristics. 
Details about the derivation of activity projections are described in the RDEIS for the proposed 
rule (USDA Forest Service 2010), as well as the resource specialist reports supporting the 
RDEIS, and are not reiterated in this regulatory impact analysis document. 
 
Distributional effects or economic impacts, in terms of jobs and labor income, are quantified for 
the oil and gas and the coal sectors for an economic area consisting of five Colorado counties 
(Delta, Garfield, Mesa, Montrose, and Rio Blanco) using a regional impact model. Fiscal impacts 
(i.e., mineral lease payments) are estimated for counties where changes in mineral activity are 
expected to be physically located (Delta, Garfield, Gunnison, Mesa, Montrose, and Pitkin). The 
distributional effects associated with reducing wildfire hazard are characterized by estimating the 
extent to which CPZ areas (i.e., 0.5 to 1.5 mile buffer areas surrounding communities at-risk 
from wildfire) overlap roadless areas where tree-cutting for fuel treatments has been identified as 
5 
 
being likely to occur. Distributional effects or economic impacts are not evaluated for other 
economic sectors (e.g., timber harvest, recreation) due to evidence presented in respective 
resource sections suggesting that the extent or magnitude of changes in output or services are not 
sufficient to cause significant changes in distributional effects. 
 
The analysis area adopted for this Regulatory Impact Analysis is equivalent for all alternatives 
(4,653,100 acres) to facilitate comparison of effects. However, the portion of the analysis area 
managed as roadless differs across alternatives; inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) under 
alternative 1 (forest plans) amount to 4,243,600 acres while Colorado roadless areas (CRAs) are 
estimated to be 4,186,000 acres under alternatives 2 (proposed rule) and 4 (proposed rule with 
additional upper tier acreage). 
 
Local Resource Challenges 
Local resource challenges include reducing the hazard to communities, property, and resources 
of wildfire; managing forests to reduce the adverse effects of insects and disease; and providing 
access for commodity production, special uses, and other desirable services (Tables E.1, E.2, and 
E.3). 
Projected levels of treatment involving tree-cutting within the analysis area, are greatest under 
the forest plans alternative (16,900 acres per year; 253,500 acres over 15 years) followed by the 
proposed rule (7,000 acres per year; 105,000 acres over 15 years), Alternative 4 (3,000 acres per 
year; 45,000 acres over 15 years), and the 2001 rule (2,300 acres per year; 34,500 acres over 15 
years). The potential timber harvest volumes associated with tree-cutting are likely to differ 
across alternatives, but these differences are not anticipated to result in significant impacts to the 
wood products and forest service sectors. 
 
Approximately 14 percent (600,000 acres) of roadless areas in Colorado are considered high risk 
for insect and disease mortality. Alternative 1 provides limited opportunities to address high risk 
acres with only 500 acres per year (7,500 acres over 15 years) of treatments directed towards 
forest health and protection against insect and disease outbreaks. Alternative 2 provides 
increased treatment opportunities (1,000 acres per year; 15,000 acres over 15 years) to improve 
resiliency to insect and disease outbreaks, particularly in Ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir stands 
as well as community protection zones (CPZs) compared to alternatives 1 and 4, but treatment 
options remain limited in many roadless areas. Alternative 3 provides the most opportunities to 
maintain forest health and improve resiliency against insects and disease with 3,500 acres per 
year of treatments projected (52,500 acres over 15 years) but opportunities are still limited in 
many areas. Treatment opportunities for resiliency under alternative 4 are greater than alternative 
1 but less than alternatives 2 and 3. 
 
Other potential changes to forest or rangeland vegetation in the roadless areas include short-term, 
localized changes in vegetation composition, structure and function related to increases in roads 
and tree-cutting activities. Long term, more widespread improvements in forest and rangeland 
health would be more pronounced under the forest plans alternative and lowest under the 2001 
rule, with the proposed rule and alternative 4 somewhere in between. There would be no 
expectation that the boundary differences in CRAs under the proposed rule would have a 
measurable impact on the opportunities to conduct treatments with the exception that a total of 
6 
 
600 out of 1,000 acres treated, are projected to occur in substantially altered areas (these 
treatments are also projected under the forest plans alternative). 
 
Fuel reduction treatments on all NFS lands in Colorado average approximately 64,000 acres per 
year. The 2001 rule provides the lowest probability of conducting hazardous fuel and forest 
health treatments in roadless areas, and least likelihood of reducing wildfire hazards to at-risk 
communities in and adjacent to roadless areas. Approximately 3 percent of annual fuel 
treatments on NFS lands in Colorado could occur in the analysis area under the 2001 rule. 
Treating 27,000 acres (<1 percent) of the 4.24 million acres in IRAs would not result in a 
significant reduction in wildfire hazard to many of the more than 600 at-risk communities that lie 
within the vicinity (3 miles) of an IRA.  
The proposed rule and the forest plans alternative both provide flexibility to prioritize where 
hazardous fuel and forest health treatments would occur in CRAs, and the associated ability to 
reduce the high-severity wildfire threats to communities and municipal watersheds that lie near 
the roadless areas. For the proposed rule, hazardous fuel reduction treatments, including tree-
cutting, are permitted to occur in CRAs if they are within Community Protection Zones (CPZs) 
and are consistent with forest plan direction. Approximately 9 percent of annual treatments on all 
NFS land in Colorado could occur in the analysis area under the proposed rule. Treating 88,000 
acres over 15 years offers more opportunity for improving fuels and fire management 
effectiveness and could result in significantly more fuels and fire hazard reduction compared to 
the 2001 rule. The proposed rule would result in reduced hazard for at-risk communities and 
other values in proximity to the CRAs. The forest plans alternative offers the greatest 
opportunity to reduce wildfire threats to values at risk. When compared to the average of 64,000 
acres annually treated on all NFS lands in Colorado, the 13,100 acres projected to occur in the 
analysis area could represent 20 percent of the total NFS acres treated annually in Colorado. 
Treating 196,500 of the 4.25 million acres in areas currently inventoried as roadless (IRAs) could 
result in reducing the fuel hazard on a significant portion of the total in IRA acreage, offering the 
greatest opportunity to improve fuels management effectiveness. Options for fuel treatments 
under alternative 4 are similar to alternative 1 where tree-cutting is projected for 2,200 acres or 
approximately 3% of total annual fuel treatments on NFS land within Colorado. However, due to 
the large number of upper tier acres under Alternative 4, fuel treatments would not be possible 
on 48% to 52% of CPZs within roadless areas. In contrast, fuel reductions would not be possible 
on 12% to 13% of CPZs under the proposed rule (under which fewer acres are classified as upper 
tier). 
Mineral and energy resources (oil and gas, coal, geothermal) from roadless areas can be of 
substantial value, and road access for exploration and development can affect future 
development of these resources. Under the 2001 rule, roads would be allowed in IRAs on oil and 
gas leases that were issued before the effective date of this rule, and those leases allowed for road 
construction; foreseeable development and production would be limited to 132,000 leased acres 
on 19 IRAs on the Grand Mesa-Uncompahgre-Gunnison (GMUG), San Juan, and White River 
NFs (i.e., areas in the Piceance Basin). Under the proposed rule, as well as Alternative 4, roading 
would be allowed on oil and gas leases that allow surface occupancy and are issued before the 
proposed Colorado Roadless Rule becomes effective. Forseeable production could occur on 
136,700 acres of leased acres on 20 CRAs on the same forests, similar to Alternative 1. Under 
the forest plans alternative, roading would be allowed on existing and future oil and gas leases 
where roads are allowed under lease terms and stipulations. Foreseeable production under the 
7 
 
forest plans alternative could occur on 173,100 leased acres on 19 IRAs. Based on these 
conditions, the forest plans alternative would have slightly more roads, oil and gas wells, and 
related infrastructure in roadless areas, and corresponding opportunity for oil and gas 
development and foreseeable production. A total of 783 wells (11 miles of roads constructed or 
reconstructed annually) are projected in the analysis area over a 15 year period with access to 
1,154 billion cubic feet of gas (bcfg)) under Alternative 3. The 2001 rule, the proposed rule, and 
Alternative 4 are all projected to have equal oil and gas production with 686 wells (9 to 10 miles 
of roads constructed or reconstructed annually) and access to 1,046 bcfg over 15 years. 
 
Under the 2001 rule, roading in IRAs would be allowed on coal leases issued prior to the 
effective date of this rule, and prohibited on coal leases issued after that date; foreseeable 
production opportunities would be limited to 8,600 acres of road-accessible coal reserves (157 
million tons) involving approximately 16 miles of roads constructed or reconstructed (7 miles in 
IRAs) over a 15 year period (157 million tons) in the West Elk IRA in the GMUG NFs. Under 
the proposed rule, as well as Alternative 4, roading would be approved pursuant to existing and 
future coal leases and coal exploration licenses in CRAs in the North Fork coal mining area on 
the GMUG NFs; foreseeable production opportunities would be limited to 27,900 acres of road-
accessible coal reserves (514 million tons) involving approximately 52 miles of roads (50 in 
CRAs) over a 15 year period in the same areas. Under the forest plans alternative, roading could 
be approved on existing and future coal leases and exploration licenses in IRAs; reasonably 
foreseeable production opportunities would exist on 39,600 acres of coal reserves (724 million 
tons) involving 73 miles of roads over a 15 year period on the GMUG NFs. Consideration could 
also be given to non-quantified reserves on 46,000 acres in the Pagosa Springs coalfield on the 
San Juan NF, as well as the unexplored and unleased coal resources on the Pike and San Isabel, 
Routt, and White River NFs. 
The forest plans alternative would have the highest potential for geothermal resource 
development in roadless areas because most land management plans do not prohibit roading in 
the roadless areas for such development. Geothermal development would not occur in roadless 
areas under the 2001 rule, the proposed rule, or alternative 4 because of prohibitions on road 
construction for this purpose. There are no current leases or lease applications for geothermal 
development on NFS lands in Colorado. A programmatic environmental impact statement (EIS) 
is underway to address the potential for geothermal resources on NFS land in Colorado. 
The Forest Service will continue to respond, under all alternatives, to all potential public health 
and safety situations in roadless areas. Under the 2001 rule, the lower number of road miles 
projected to occur in roadless areas would continue to be more limiting regarding responsiveness 
and timeliness to emergency health and safety situations. Under the proposed rule, Alternative 4, 
and to a greater extent under the forest plans alternative, increases in road miles projected to 
occur in roadless areas could facilitate responses to emergency health and safety situations. 
However, upper tier acres in Alternatives 2 and 4 do not have a specific public health and safety 
exception for road construction, as does Alternative 1. 
In Colorado, there are approximately 3,900 lands-related special use authorizations on NFS lands 
authorized to individuals, business entities, State and local governments, and other Federal 
agencies. These uses include, but are not limited to reservoirs, monitoring stations, 
communication sites, electric transmission, oil and gas pipelines, and water conveyance. All 
alternatives allow for continuation or renewal of existing authorizations in roadless areas. A draft 
8 
 
programmatic EIS (Department of Energy, Bureau of Land Management (BLM)) regarding 
designated energy corridors on Federal lands does not indicate that corridor designations would 
go through IRAs or CRAs. 
Special use authorizations for oil and gas pipelines, electrical and telecommunications lines, and 
water conveyances issued prior to the effective date of this rule are unaffected under all 
alternatives. However, under Alternative 1, future authorizations (i.e., after the effective date of 
this rule) would generally prohibit roads by allow linear construction zones (LCZs), including for 
oil and gas pipelines from lease areas outside of IRAs. Approximately 3.2 miles of LCZs per 
year are projected under Alternative 1 for these types of special use authorizations. Opportunities 
for future authorizations related to these types of uses are similar for alternatives 2 and 4, 
however allowances for LCZs are more limiting – including the requirement that LCZs be 
allowed only if it can be shown that greater environmental damage would occur by constructing 
lines or conveyances around CRAs. Alternatives 2 and 4 also prohibit LCZ and road construction 
for other types of future special use authorizations (i.e., other than OG pipelines, 
electrical/telecommunication lines, and water conveyances). Similar to Alternative 1, 3.2 miles 
of LCZs per year are projected under Alternatives 2 and 4. Road and LCZ construction would 
generally be allowed for a variety of future special use authorizations under Alternative 3, except 
where prohibited under management plans. Approximately 3.6 miles of LCZs per year are 
projected under Alternative 3.  
Ski resorts are one of the major land use authorizations permitted on NFS lands in Colorado. The 
2001 rule would limit opportunities for ski area development (road construction, tree-cutting) for 
those acres associated with ski areas that are in roadless areas that were not authorized in a 
permit prior to the effective date of this rule. As a result, development may occur on 6,600 acres 
in IRAs across multiple ski areas, but road construction and tree-cutting would be prohibited on 
1,700 acres allocated for skiing under plans but outside of existing permits. Under the proposed 
rule and Alternative 4, the ski areas that are currently in IRAs would not be included in the 
CRAs. This would allow road construction and tree-cutting on the additional 1,700 acres outside 
of existing permits. Under the forest plans alternative the potential to construct roads and cut 
trees in IRAs in ski areas would be the same as under the proposed rule. Authorization of roads 
in developed ski areas might facilitate the implementation of required ski area vegetation 
management plans to improve forest health, remove hazard trees, and manage fuels. 
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant impact on other local resource issues or 
concerns including livestock grazing, saleable minerals, other leasable minerals, or locatable 
minerals. 
Roadless Characteristics 
Roadless characteristics include high quality soil, water (including drinking water), and air; plant 
and animal diversity; habitat for sensitive species; reference landscapes and high scenic quality; 
primitive and semi-primitive recreation; cultural resources; and other locally identified unique 
characteristics (Table E.2). Potential effects to roadless characteristics in the next 15 years are 
expected to be a function, in part, of the levels of roading, tree-cutting, and energy resource 
activity that are projected to be reasonably foreseeable during that time. 
Overall, minimal direct effects to roadless area characteristics from tree-cutting and road 
construction or reconstruction are expected under the 2001 rule (Alternative 1) because there is 
little activity projected to occur on 88 - 89% of IRA acres. Some risk of adverse effects to 
9 
 
roadless area characteristics from the construction of LCZs is possible under the 2001 rule, and 
there would be no regulatory protection of roadless characteristics on 409,500 acres currently 
outside of IRA boundaries that exhibit roadless characteristics. 
Under the proposed rule (Alternative 2), minimal direct effects to roadless area characteristics 
are expected because there is little activity projected to occur on 98% of CRA acres. The 
proposed rule has the lowest risk of adverse effect to roadless area characteristics from LCZ 
construction as this activity is generally restricted, and regulatory protection of roadless area 
characteristics on an additional 409,500 acres within CRA boundaries is provided under the 
proposed rule. The direct effects of Alternative 4 (proposed rule with additional public proposed 
upper tier acres) on roadless characteristics are similar to the proposed rule, recognizing that 
little activity is projected to occur on 99% of CRAs. 
In general, the forest plans alternative (Alternative 3) has the potential to pose the greatest direct 
risk to roadless area characteristics because there are no regulatory prohibitions on road 
construction or tree-cutting, sale or removal in areas that have roadless characteristics within the 
analysis area. Approximately 10% of the analysis area is currently substantially altered; an 
additional 5% has projected activities in next 15 years; and 85% will retain roadless area 
characteristics under the forest plans alternative. No regulatory protection of roadless area 
characteristics other than that described in forest plans and the Forest Service Manual (FSM) is 
provided. 
Some of the direct adverse effects of increasing levels of tree-cutting and road construction on 
roadless characteristics under alternatives 4, 2, and 3 respectively may be offset in the long-run 
by the indirect beneficial effects of the vegetation treatments facilitated by the projected 
activities. Forest health and fuel treatments are designed to help increase resiliency to insect and 
disease outbreaks, reduce the ecological and social hazards of high severity wildfires, and 
improve other resource conditions that can contribute to roadless characteristics. More details 
about potential short and long-term effects to roadless characteristics under each alternative are 
presented below. 
 
Roadless area characteristics and values typically include “natural-appearing landscapes with 
high scenic quality. The CRAs currently have a high degree of scenic integrity. The 2001 rule 
would retain the greatest number of roadless area acres at high to very high scenic integrity 
levels; scenic quality would remain largely unaltered. Many substantially altered area acres 
would continue to reflect moderate to low scenic integrity levels, inconsistent with general 
roadless area characteristics and values.  The proposed rule would retain the majority of CRAs at 
high to very high scenic integrity levels, including upper tier acres. Projected levels of road 
construction and other activity could result in a higher potential than the 2001 rule for portions of 
roadless areas to shift to a moderate to low scenic integrity levels. Substantially altered 
landscapes would not be included in the CRAs and would therefore not detract from scenic 
integrity in designated roadless areas. The new unroaded areas included in CRAs would likely 
add to the number of areas protected at high to very high scenic integrity levels compared to the 
forest plans alternative. Tree-cutting associated with treatments under Alternative 2, as well as 
other alternatives, may have long-term beneficial impacts on scenic quality. The forest plans 
alternative would retain fewer acres in the IRAs at the current high to very high scenic integrity 
levels, compared to the other alternatives. More portions of IRAs would gradually shift to a 
moderate to low scenic integrity level due to the levels of projected activity. The effects of 
10 
 
alternative 4 are likely to be similar to alternative 2 but with slightly reduced risk from projected 
activities and greater potential for high scenic integrity in the larger number of upper tier acres. 
Overall, tree-cutting and road construction activities occur on a relatively small percentage of 
total roadless acres, implying scenic quality in large portions of roadless areas will be unaffected. 
Potential effects would be moderated under all alternatives through project-level compliance 
with scenic integrity and visual quality objectives specified in land management plans. 
 
There are a total of 35 designated wilderness areas in Colorado comprising 3,200,000 acres. 
Approximately 457,000 acres in 14 IRAs have been recommended for wilderness in land 
management plans. None of the three alternatives, including the proposed rule, will have a direct 
effect on designated wilderness, because these areas are outside of IRAs or CRAs. The effects to 
areas recommended as wilderness in land management plans, likewise, do not differ across 
alternatives, because land management plans generally prohibit road construction and tree-
cutting and removal activities in those areas. The 2001 rule generally prohibits tree cutting and 
road building in IRAs and would therefore be least likely to result in effects that detract from 
wilderness characteristics in the adjacent wilderness areas. The restrictions on activities in IRAs 
under the 2001 rule provide a greater opportunity to maintain future options for new 
recommendations of roadless acres as wilderness. The activity prohibitions under the proposed 
rule and Alternative 4 would minimize the potential risk of detracting from wilderness 
characteristics or experience in adjacent wilderness areas, but projected activity levels, including 
coal mining, could increase risks compared to the 2001 rule. Projections of increased activity 
could also reduce the number of roadless acres that might support future wilderness 
recommendations. The risk of detracting from wilderness characteristics in adjacent wilderness 
areas would be highest under the forest plans alternative. This alternative could also potentially 
create the greatest reduction in the number of roadless acres that would be capable of supporting 
new wilderness recommendations. Inclusion of 562,300 and 2.6 million CRA acres in upper tiers 
under alternatives 2 and 4 respectively may help establish a uniform management approach for 
recommended wilderness, recognizing that upper tier selection is not based on wilderness 
criteria. 
 
There are portions of a congressionally designated wild and scenic river (Cache la Poudre river), 
and a National Scenic Trail in roadless areas. None of the alternatives would directly impact the 
congressionally designated trail, and none of the alternatives would directly impact the stretches 
of the wild and scenic river corridor classified as “wild” or “recreation,” because the statute 
designating the river is equally or more restrictive. Due to similar statutory precedence, none of 
the altenatives would alter the management or scenic values of the Continental Divide National 
Scenic Trail. However, there could be indirect effects from projected activity levels under the 
various alternatives on the characteristics and values of adjacent designated areas. Road 
construction and tree-cutting are not projected to occur on Research Natural Areas (RNAs) or 
Special Interest Areas (SIAs) under any alternative. Some land management plans allow roads or 
facilities to be built in RNAs or SIAs, although the values for which the area was established 
would need to be maintained. 
 
Soil disturbance from road construction and other ground-disturbing activities can affect the soil 
resource by increasing erosion, compaction, and other soil quality conditions. The potential for 
adverse impacts on the soil resource in roadless areas would differ slightly among the 
11 
 
alternatives based on different levels of projected roading, tree removal, and energy resource 
development activities. The 2001 rule and Alternative 4 would have the least potential for 
adverse impacts, and the forest plans alternative would have the greatest potential for adverse 
soil impacts. However, the differences among alternatives would be insignificant because effects 
from those projected activities would be mitigated through the use of site-specific analysis, 
watershed conservation practices, and other best management practices (BMPs), including post-
project rehabilitation of disturbed soil. The risk of post-fire soil erosion may be highest under 
alternative 1 and lowest under alternative 3 as a result of projected fuel treatment activity. 
Impacts would also be limited in geographic extent and would be distributed over many different 
roadless areas. Thus, the actual effects on soil quality would be minor and of short duration. 
 
The relative differences in potential water quality impacts in roadless areas under any of the 
alternatives would be negligible. The 2001 rule would have the least risk of adverse effects on 
water quality, while the proposed rule and alternative 4 would have a slightly higher risk, 
followed by the forest plans alternative with the greatest risk of adverse impacts in the roadless 
areas. However, actual impacts on water quality anticipated from any alternative would be small 
in magnitude and scattered over a wide geographic area. Most of the potential effects would be 
of short duration, with disturbed soil areas rehabilitated after projects are completed in those 
areas. Future activities under the alternatives are not expected to cause exceedences of water 
quality standards or contribute to the list of impaired water bodies. Increasing levels of projected 
fuel treatment activity under alternatives 2, 4, and 3 respectively are expected to help decrease 
risks to water quality and municipal water supplies from floods and sedimentation resulting from 
wildfire. 
 
There is no major difference in the projected effects on air quality among the alternatives. One 
minor difference is related to potential smoke-related impacts from wildfires, which would be 
more likely to occur in roadless areas under the 2001 rule, and least likely to occur under the 
forest plans alternative. There are projections of methane gas emissions that would contribute to 
cumulative amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  However, the methane would 
dissipate to such diluted concentrations as to be insignificant.   
 
Threatened and endangered (T&E) species are listed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to 
satisfy the goals of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), while sensitive plant species are 
designated by a regional forester for which population viability is a concern. One T&E and 44 
sensitive plant species are known or likely to occur in roadless areas in Colorado. The 
alternatives do not substantially differ in their estimated effect on T&E plant species, because no 
additional roading, tree-cutting, or energy development activities are projected to occur in the 
portions of roadless areas that support T&E plants. The only difference among alternatives in the 
risk to T&E plants is related to potential increases in risk under Alternative 4, the proposed rule, 
and the forest plans alternative, compared to the 2001 rule, from invasive plants spreading into 
T&E plant communities. The risk of impact on sensitive plants could be progressively higher 
under Alternative 4, the proposed rule, and the forest plans alternative compared to the 2001 rule 
primarily because of (a) the higher likelihood of increases in invasive plants spreading into 
sensitive plant communities, and (b) the higher likelihood of inadvertent mistakes that may be 
made during project implementation. These differences in risk are correlated with the differences 
in the amount of projected activities in roadless areas that support sensitive plants. However, 
12 
 
none of the alternatives are expected to result in the loss of viability, nor cause a trend toward 
federal listing of sensitive species due in part to site specific design criteria and mitigation 
measures designed to minimize risk. In contrast to potential adverse effects from projected 
activities, some management actions (e.g., forest health treatments) in roadless areas could 
benefit sensitive plants over the long term, even if there are short-term adverse impacts. 
 
One T&E fish species, five sensitive fish species, six management indicator fish species (MIS) 
(MIS are identified in a forest plan as an indicator of management effectiveness), one aquatic 
mammal MIS (American beaver), and an array of benthic invertebrate MIS are known or likely 
to occur in roadless areas in Colorado. There are also aquatic habitats in many roadless areas that 
have been identified as being ecologically important as well as “rare” (e.g., fens, other wetlands). 
Considering the overall effects of each alternative, regardless of the differences on each forest, 
the 2001 rule would pose the least risk of adverse impact, and would generally have the least 
potential for adverse effects on protecting aquatic species and habitat compared to the more 
intensively managed lands outside roadless areas. The proposed rule and Alternative 4 would 
have more potential for adverse impacts to aquatic species due to projected activities, with the 
greatest potential for adverse effects under the forest plans alternative. Activities projected under 
the proposed rule as well as other alternatives are not expected to result in measurable declines in 
overall population trends on any national forest for any of the aquatic T&E species, sensitive 
species, or MIS due in part to site and project-specific mitigation measures and BMPs. The 
proposed rule and Alternative 4 provide greater protection for cutthroat trout compared to 
alternatives 1 and 3. While potential for adverse effects may be similar for the proposed rule and 
Alternative 4, a portion of upper tier acres under Alternative 4 are within watersheds occupied by 
TES fish, implying potential improvements in protection relative to Alternative 2. A beneficial 
effect of the proposed rule and the forest plans alternative would be associated with the increased 
amount of fuel reduction treatment acres in IRAs, which could reduce wildfire severity in the 
IRAs and CRAs, resulting in beneficial effects on aquatic habitat and species. 
 
The greatest concern for potential impacts to aquatic species and habitat occurs when aquatic 
species and habitat overlap with roadless areas where roading and tree-cutting activities are 
projected, especially where combined with projected oil-gas and/or coal activities. This risk 
would be highest under the forest plans alternative, slightly less under the proposed rule and 
Alternative 4, and lowest under the 2001 rule. The roadless areas of highest concern occur on the 
GMUG, San Juan, and White River NFs. 
 
For terrestrial wildlife, six T&E species, 34 sensitive species, and 36 MIS are known or likely to 
occur in roadless areas in Colorado.  The 2001 rule would afford terrestrial species and habitats 
the most protection because it is most restrictive for activities in the roadless areas that could be 
detrimental to T&E, sensitive, MIS, and migratory bird species. By comparison, the proposed 
rule offers a lower level of protection in roadless areas than the 2001 rule due to activity 
permissions in areas with TES terrestrial species and habitats. The forest plans alternative 
correspondingly would have the highest potential for adverse impacts to terrestrial species and 
habitat. Lower activity projections and increased allocation of acreage to upper tier status under 
Alternative 4 reduces risks compared to Alternatives 2 and 3. Detrimental effects from an 
expected increase in invasive plants, animals, and pathogens would be of greater risk under the 
proposed rule and the forest plans alternative respectively. Given the temporary status of most 
13 
 
roads projected for roadless areas, the impact of these roads would be relatively short-term. 
However, increases in roads could encourage non-motorized recreational use as well as 
unauthorized motorized use that could increase potential impacts to wildlife.  
 
The increasing opportunities to treat acres for forest health and fuels under Alternative 4, the 
proposed rule, and the forest plans alternative respectively could improve terrestrial habitats for 
early seral species in some areas and reduce the potential for a severe stand-replacing wildfire 
that could adversely impact terrestrial habitat. While a majority of projected treatment acreage is 
for forest health and fuels, only a small number of projected treatment acres in roadless areas 
have been identified as being for TEPS habitat improvement (e.g., <5 acres for alternatives 1 and 
4; less than 100 acres for alternatives 2 and 3). Restricting tree-cutting to smaller-diameter trees 
under Alternatives 2 and 4, and the limitations of tree-cutting to small diameter trees under 
Alternative 1 help maintain larger trees and provide more variability in forest structure. 
 
In general, for all alternatives, activities may affect individual terrestrial animals but are not 
likely to adversely affect terrestrial populations or critical habitat of T&E species, nor result in 
the loss of viability or cause a trend toward Federal listing for sensitive species. There is 
increasing potential for change in population trends for MIS under Alternative 4, the proposed 
rule, and the forest plans alternative respectively, depending upon the location, timing, intensity, 
and magnitude of activity. But, as with plants and aquatic species, potential adverse effects to 
terrestrial species are expected to be either avoided or minimized through compliance with 
standards and guidelines in land management plans and other applicable laws, regulations, and 
policy. 
 
The value of roadless areas in conserving biodiversity is likely to increase as habitat loss and 
habitat degradation increase in scope and magnitude in lands outside of roadless areas. Potential 
benefits of conserving roadless areas include protected large contiguous blocks of habitat and 
biological strongholds as well as providing habitat connectivity. These types of benefits would 
be similar for the proposed rule, Alternative 4, and the 2001 rule but would be realized to a lesser 
degree under the forest plans alternative. The forest plans alternative, because of fewer 
restrictions, would probably pose a higher risk of affecting biological diversity. Increasing 
opportunities for treatments under Alternatives 4, 2, and 3 respectively to address hazardous 
fuels and insect and disease outbreaks/spreading may have off-setting beneficial effects on long-
term biodiversity. 
 
Potential damages from invasive plants differ by alternative primarily in terms of the acres 
included in or eliminated from roadless designation. They also differ in terms of projected 
activity levels. The potential spread of invasive plants in roadless areas under the 2001 rule 
would therefore remain low. The risk of increasing invasive plant occurrences would remain 
relatively low under the proposed rule and Alternative 4, with the greatest relative risk under the 
forest plans alternative. Overall, the potential magnitude and geographic extent of ground 
disturbance and spread of invasive plants in roadless areas would still be relatively low under the 
forest plans alternative. 
 
The 2001 rule would retain the greatest proportion of roadless area acres in a primitive or semi-
primitive setting, at the lowest level of human development. Smaller proportions of the IRAs 
14 
 
would show evidence of motorized vehicle use or be in a roaded natural setting. None of the 
projected activities under the 2001 rule would be expected to reduce the quality of hunting and 
fishing opportunities. The proposed rule would retain a majority of the CRA acres in a semi-
primitive setting, although there would be more CRA acres with roads and energy operations. 
The higher levels of human activity and development would shift some areas from offering semi-
primitive opportunities to a more roaded natural setting. Excluding the substantially altered areas 
and developed ski areas in CRAs would allow the CRAs to appear more consistent with semi-
primitive and unroaded characteristics expected in roadless areas. The inclusion of unroaded 
areas in CRAs would further protect and provide for dispersed recreation in generally unroaded 
and semi-primitive settings.  Hunting and fishing opportunities likely would not change under 
the proposed rule because of the dispersed nature of projected road and tree-cutting activity and 
the large amount of NFS lands not altered by these activities. The amount of projected activity 
under the forest plans alternative may create the greatest risk of shifts from primitive/semi-
primitive settings to roaded natural settings in areas where the most roads and energy operations 
are projected to occur. The effects of the IRA boundaries would be the same as described for the 
2001 rule; however, more of the IRAs that offer semi-primitive settings would shift toward 
roaded natural settings as more roading, tree cutting and energy resource development occurs in 
the IRAs. The effects of alternative 4 on dispersed recreation would be similar to alternative 2, 
with more opportunities to retain higher proportions of primitive/semi-primitive acres given 
slight reductions in construction and tree-cutting activity under Alternative 4. In general, 
dispersed recreation opportunities are not expected to change under any alternative, but feelings 
of remoteness and solitude may change for periods of time in areas where activity occurs. 
 
The effects to developed recreation opportunities in roadless areas do not substantially differ 
between the alternatives. Developed recreation sites would not be constructed in the roadless 
areas under the 2001 rule or the proposed rule. One mile of road construction for development of 
a new campground is projected under the forest plans alternative over the next 15 years. 
 
None of the alternatives would be expected to cause a measurable change in the amount of 
carbon dioxide nor other greenhouse gas emissions compared to current conditions and trends in 
the roadless areas under the no-action alternative (the 2001 rule). The cumulative effects of 
climate change, in combination with the direct effects associated with the alternatives, on 
roadless area conditions (e.g., drought, wildfire, insects/disease) and resources (e.g., water yield, 
air quality, T&E species and habitat) cannot be quantitatively described in this programmatic 
evaluation.  
 
The proposed rule is expected to have negligible adverse effects on other resources associated 
with roadless characteristics including geological and paleontological resources, cultural and 
heritage sites, non-timber products, and recreational special uses (including outfitter and guide 
opportunities) based on reasonably foreseeable activity projections. Any adverse impacts to these 
resources and services would be addressed through analysis conducted in accordance with NEPA 
and minimized through compliance with forest plan standards and guidelines. 
Agency Costs 
Agency costs are summarized in Table E.2. The proposed rule does not prescribe project-level or 
site-specific activities. Differences in program costs have therefore not been quantified, but 
qualitative comparisons of relative treatment effectiveness can be made. 
15 
 
Treatment projects associated with fuel reductions and/or forest health may involve one or more 
treatment methods including biomass removal, mechanical mulching, mastication, and 
prescribed fire. In most roadless areas, the limited amount of roads, fuel-breaks, and fuel-treated 
areas makes them more difficult to treat and more vulnerable to high-severity fires. Much of the 
road construction under the proposed rule is expected to be affiliated with biomass removal 
under service contracts with or without salvage rights, stewardship, or a timber sale where 
receipts can help offset the cost of treatment and temporary road construction. Given the 
assumption that program budgets will remain relatively flat, it is unlikely that the alternatives 
will result in significant changes in administrative costs.  
 
Under the 2001 rule, fuel treatments would likely be more expensive and less efficient to 
implement in IRAs because of the lack of established roads and inability to reconstruct or 
construct roads. Compared to the 2001 rule, the proposed rule would provide increased 
flexibility to achieve fire and fuels management objectives in critical areas in Community 
Protection Zones (CPZs), where consistent with forest plan direction. Circumstances allowing 
construction of temporary road miles would increase the Agency’s ability to strategically locate 
fuel treatment areas on the landscape to improve effectiveness and possibly reduce the total 
amount of the landscape that requires treatment. Under the proposed rule, treating 5,900 acres 
per year implies that more hazardous fuel treatments would occur in CRAs, compared with the 
4,400 acres of CRAs treated annually on average from the past several decades, if budgets 
remain flat. Correspondingly, fewer treatments would occur outside CRAs. Under the forest 
plans alternative, there would be a shift to treating even more acres (up to 16,100 acres per year) 
in IRAs and fewer acres outside IRAs compared to the past 9-year trend. The effects of building 
more roads for fuel treatments would generally be the same as described for the proposed rule, 
including increased efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness in wildfire suppression response as 
well as hazardous fuel reduction in WUIs. Alternative 4 is structured similar to Alternative 2, 
thereby offering similar strategic and efficiency advantages regarding treatments. However, due 
to increased acreage assigned to upper tier status, projected treatment levels are reduced under 
Alternative 4. 
 
Road maintenance costs have been exceeding funding levels for at least the past couple decades. 
Thus, there is a backlog of road maintenance needs on NFS land, and the Agency has 
increasingly emphasized the decommissioning of unnecessary roads; for every mile of new road 
constructed over the past 10 years on NFS lands in Colorado, more than 10 miles of authorized 
or unauthorized roads on NFS lands have been decommissioned. It is expected that the trend in 
closing and decommissioning more road miles than are constructed would continue, recognizing 
that it may become more difficult to identify roads for decommissioning over time. The focus on 
temporary roads, in addition to decommissioning, will decrease the need for maintenance 
expenditure. 
Distributional Effects 
The distributional effects are listed in Table E.3. Many roadless areas (IRAs and CRAs) are in 
rural counties in the western and southwestern regions of Colorado, though some roadless areas 
are in counties in the Front Range metro area. A large majority of counties are considered small 
(population less than 50,000). The resource outputs with measurable and quantifiable differences 
between alternatives are oil and gas, and coal. Jobs and income contributed by these output 
levels are estimated for a five county “energy model” area (Delta, Garfield, Mesa, Montrose, Rio 
16 
 
Blanco counties). Changes in output of goods or services associated with timber harvest, 
livestock, recreation/special use permits, and other resource sectors are not projected to be 
significant across alternatives.  
The provisions for enhanced energy mineral development under the proposed rule and the forest 
plans alternative are likely to result in sizeable increases of average annual production, 
employment, and labor income contributed by energy sectors over the next 15 years. Total value 
of annual output from the oil, gas, and coal sectors is estimated to be similar for the proposed 
rule and the forest plans alternative ($969 and $1,026 million per year respectively) and 
substantially higher than output under the 2001 rule ($636 million). Total jobs contributed under 
the 2001 rule are estimated to be 1,557 jobs, increasing to 2,679 under the proposed rule and to 
2,796 under the forest plans alternative. Respective annual labor income is estimated to be $101 
million, $183 million, and $190 million (2006 dollars). Results for Alternative 4 are equivalent 
to the results for the proposed rule. The total annual output, employment, and labor income 
associated with the entire mining sector in the five-county energy model area is estimated to be 
approximately $5.1 billion, 7,027 jobs, and $662.1 million for 2006. 
A pattern similar to economic impacts emerges for average annual State and local government 
revenues (i.e., revenue sharing) from energy mineral leases. Compared with $28.4 million per 
year total payments and taxes received by the State and counties under the 2001 rule, payments 
are estimated to be approximately 67% larger for the proposed rule ($47.3 million per year) and 
75% higher under the forest plans alternative ($49.7 million per year).  Again, results for 
Alternative 4 are equivalent to the proposed rule. Other Federal payments to State and local 
governments, such as those from National Forest (25 percent) Fund and Payments in Lieu of 
Taxes (PILT), are expected to either not change or be more than offset by revenues from Federal 
mineral lease payments. 
 
The distribution of projected fuel treatments and corresponding reduction in wildfire hazard to 
at-risk-communities near roadless areas varies by alternative. Values at risk can include citizen 
health, reliable water and power supplies, infrastructure (e.g., buildings, both public and private), 
business activity, and general quality of life. Potential opportunities for fuel treatments (based on 
projected likelihood of tree-cutting for fuel treatments in roadless areas that overlap with 
community protection zones (CPZs)) decreases for 13 counties under the 2001 rule compared to 
baseline conditions (i.e., forest plans alternative) and increases for one county. Results are 
similar for Alternative 4 compared to baseline conditions where treatment potential decreases for 
18 counties and increases for five. There is little projected change in potential fuel treatments 
within CPZs under the proposed rule compared to forest plans (baseline conditions) (decrease in 
two counties and increase in three counties), suggesting that potential opportunities to address 
wildfire hazards to at-risk communities are similar under the proposed rule and the forest plans 
alternative.   These results simply identify potential opportunities and are not intended to be 
projections of the actual extent or magnitude of WUI treatments.

Timber 
Tree-cutting (sale or removal) in the roadless analysis area is projected to occur in association with treatments on 2,300, 3,000, 
7,000, and 16,900 acres per year respectively under Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, average annual treatment acreage on 
all NFS land is not expected to be affected substantially by the alternatives, with the only change being the extent to which 
treatments occur in roadless versus non-roadless areas on NFS lands. Minimal impacts to the wood products sector are therefore 
expected. 
Oil and Gas 
Projections are for approximately 686 oil and gas wells in the 
analysis area with access to 1,046 bcfg over a 15-year 
period (same for Alternatives 1, 2, and 4). Projected annual 
road construction and reconstruction is about 10 miles in

Geothermal  
Opportunities for geothermal development in roadless areas would not occur under the 2001 rule, the proposed rule, and 
Alternative 4 due to new road prohibitions. Opportunities for geothermal development in roadless areas would occur under the 
forest plans alternative as most land management plans allow new roads in roadless areas for this purpose. There are no 
current leases on NFS lands in Colorado, though potential for geothermal resources is being studied. 
 
Public Safety 
All of the alternatives provide adequate flexibility to respond to emergency situations or major threats to public health and safety 
in roadless areas (refer to features common to all alternatives). In contrast, the potential for accidents and safety hazards 
increases as the amount of activity and traffic increases, The Forest Service will continue to respond to wildfires, chemical or 
oil spills, abandoned mine hazards, road-design hazards, hazard trees, and other similar situations. Roads for this purpose 
must be temporary under the proposed rule, and would be expected to be temporary under the 2001 rule and forest plans.

Other Developed Recreation Only one mile of new road is current projected for recreational purposes over the next 15 years under No Action; effects on developed recreation opportunities therefore do not differ substantially across alternatives.  
 Livestock Management None of the projected activities in roadless areas that vary by alternative would be likely to have any substantial beneficial or adverse impacts on livestock management operations in roadless area grazing allotments. 
Roadless Area Characteristics and Values 
Scenic Quality 
Projected activity levels (e.g., tree-cutting) occur on relatively small percentages of total roadless area under all alternatives. 
 
Maintains the most IRA 
acreage at high to very 
high scenic integrity levels 
where it exists.  
Retains majority of CRAs at 
high or very high integrity, 
including CRAs in upper 
tiers; the scenic integrity of 
some areas would be 
reduced by the roads and 
road-related activities 
projected as likely to occur 
in CRAs. 
Tree-cutting associated with 
treatments may result in 
high quality scenic levels in 
the long-term. 
Highest risk to scenic 
integrity, as more IRA 
acres may shift to a 
moderate to low scenic 
integrity as a result of road 
and tree-cutting activities 
projected. 
Greater opportunities for 
treatments may contribute 
more to high quality scenic 
levels in the long-term.

about preserving high 
quality scenic levels in 
upper tier acres, compared 
to Alternative 2. 
Wilderness and Other 
Congressionally 
Designated Areas 
No major difference among the alternatives related to the risk of adverse effects on congressionally designated areas. There 
would be no potential direct effect on these areas as they are outside the roadless areas that are the subject of each 
alternative.

Alternative 2

Proposed Rule with Public 
Identified Upper Tier Acres 
Effects on areas in forest plans as recommended wilderness would not differ by alternative as land management plans generally 
prohibit road construction and tree-cutting and removal activities in those areas. However, restrictions on activities in IRAs 
under the 2001 rule provide a greater opportunity to maintain future options for recommending roadless acres as wilderness in 
the future, compared to the proposed rule and forest plans.   
Indirect effects on wilderness area characteristics or 
experience from activities in adjacent roadless areas are 
expected to be low under Alternatives 1 and 2 because 
projected activities are not expected to occur adjacent to 
wilderness area boundaries. 
Higher risk of indirect adverse 
effects on wilderness 
experience from activities 
in the analysis area due to 
higher likelihood that 
activities could occur 
adjacent to wilderness 
boundaries. 
Similar to Alternatives 1 and 
2. Greater opportunity to 
establish uniform 
management approaches 
for recommended 
wilderness through 
placement of roadless 
areas in upper tier. 
Soil 
No major difference among alternatives related to the risk of soil impacts. Alternative 1 and 4 would have the least risk of adverse 
effects, and alternative 2 would have a slightly higher risk, followed by alternative 3. However, these differences are expected 
to be small in magnitude and spread over a wide geographic area.  Most of the potential effects would be mitigated by site-
specific mitigation measures. The risk of post-fire soil erosion may be higher under Alternative 1 and lowest under Alternative 3 
as a result of projected levels of fuel treatments. 
Water and Water Quality 
Activities under all alternatives are unlikely to contribute to water quality impairment (i.e., exceeding water quality standards) due 
to application of mitigation measures and BMPs as a result of NEPA process and site-specific analysis. 
 
Lowest risk of direct adverse 
effects from tree-cutting 
and road construction. 
Higher risk from adverse 
impacts from floods and 
sedimentation resulting 
from wildfires. 
Slightly greater risk of direct 
adverse effects from tree-
cutting and road 
construction. Decreased 
risks from floods and 
sedimentation resulting 
from wildfire, relative to 
alternatives 1 and 4, due to 
increased fuel treatments 
to protect communities 
and/or water supplies. 
Higher risk of direct adverse 
effects from tree-cutting 
and road construction.  
Greatest decrease in risk from 
floods and sedimentation 
resulting from wildfire due 
to increased fuel 
treatments to protect 
communities and/or water 
supplies. 
Similar to Alternative 2 though 
slightly lower risk from 
tree-cutting and road 
construction activities. 
Air Resources Differences in effects on air quality do not substantially differ between the alternatives.  Atmospheric emissions within the analysis area are not expected to increase to a level that would be likely to exceed State or Federal air quality standards. 
Threatened Endangered or 
Sensitive Plants 
No adverse impacts to threatened or endangered plants because no road construction or tree-cutting, sale or removal is 
projected to occur where threatened or endangered plants exist.  Site specific design criteria and mitigation measures are 
expected to minimize risk. Individual sensitive plants may be affected by projected activities, however, none of the alternatives 
are expected to result in the loss of viability, nor cause a trend toward Federal listing of sensitive species.

No long-term adverse effects are expected on threatened and endangered (T&E)species, sensitive species, and MIS population

Terrestrial Species and 
Habitat 
For all alternatives, potential adverse effects are expected to be avoided or minimized through compliance with standards and 
guidelines in land management plans and other applicable laws and policies. For all alternatives, activities may affect

Biodiversity 
The value of roadless areas in conserving biodiversity is likely to increase as habitat loss and habitat degradation increase in 
scope and magnitude in lands outside of roadless areas.  Opportunities for protected large contiguous blocks of habitat, 
biological strongholds, and habitat connectivity would be greatest for the 2001 rule and lowest under the forest plans 
alternative. Increasing opportunities for treatments under Alternatives 4, 2, and 3 respectively to address hazardous fuels and 
insect and disease outbreaks/spreading may have off-setting beneficial effects on long-term biodiversity.

Recreation - Primitive and 
Semi-Primitive Recreation 
Settings and Opportunities 
Tree-cutting activity is projected to occur on only a small percentage of roadless areas over 15 years across the alternatives. 
Dispersed recreation opportunities (including hunting and fishing) are therefore not expected to change under any alternative, 
but feelings of remoteness and solitude may change for periods of time in areas where activity occurs.  
Likely to retain the greatest 
proportion of IRA acreage 
in a primitive or semi-
primitive setting. 
The substantially altered 
areas and developed ski 
areas in IRAs may 
continue to appear 
inconsistent with semi-
primitive characteristics 
expected in roadless 
areas. 
Likely to retain a high 
proportion of CRA acreage 
in a semi-primitive setting; 
although some CRA acres 
would shift toward roaded 
natural in areas where the 
most roads and energy 
operations are projected to 
occur in CRAs.  
By not including substantially 
altered areas and 
developed ski areas in 
CRAs and adding 
unroaded areas to CRAs, 
the CRAs would appear 
more consistent with semi-
primitive characteristics 
expected in roadless 
areas. 
Greatest risk of shifts from 
primitive/semi-primitive 
settings to roaded natural 
settings in areas where the 
most roads and energy 
operations are projected to 
occur.   
 
Same as Alternative 2 but 
more likely to retain high 
proportion of 
primitive/semi-primitive 
acres given slight 
reductions in construction 
and tree-cutting activity. 
Outfitters and Guides 
(recreation) 
Out of 1,390 recreational special use permits authorized on NFS lands in Colorado, 1,066 are associated with outfitters and 
guides, some of which are likely to operate in roadless areas. The alternatives are expected to have negligible adverse effects 
on recreational special uses, including outfitter and guide opportunities, based on the magnitude and distribution of reasonably 
foreseeable activity projections; 7,000 acres of tree-cutting and 20 miles of road construction per year are projected over more 
than 4 million CRA acres under the proposed rule . Limitations on road construction and tree-cutting under any alternative 
would not be likely to affect ability to obtain or use a recreation use authorization. 
Cultural Resources 
Least risk of damage to 
cultural resources because 
this alternative has the 
least projections for tree-
cutting, sale or removal. 
Site-specific design criteria 
and mitigation measures 
are expected to minimize 
risk.

Native Plants, Including 
Special Status Plants 
No major difference among alternatives related to the risk of adverse effects on native threatened, endangered or sensitive plant 
species. There would be very little to no increases in roads, tree-cutting, or energy development activities in the roadless areas 
that support those plant species. The main difference is the higher risk under the proposed rule and the forest plans alternative 
that invasive plants would increase from the higher levels of ground-disturbance, thereby increasing this threat to native plant 
communities.  
Geological and Paleotological 
Resources 
None of the projected activities in roadless areas that vary by alternative would be likely to adversely affect geological or 
paleontological resources, which would either be avoided or otherwise protected from potential adverse impacts. 
Climate Change  
None of the alternatives are expected to cause a measurable change in the amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas 
emissions. The cumulative effects of climate change on roadless area conditions cannot be quantitatively described in this 
programmatic evaluation. With regard to energy resources, it is assumed that if production is not allowed in roadless areas, 
the same greenhouse impacts will be moved to  sites outside roadless areas and contribute the same amount to the 
atmosphere. In terms of fuels treatments,biomass removed can be burned, used in products, replace fossil fuels, or be left in 
piles elsewhere on the landscape. Except for prescribed burning, any of these disposal methods would slow release of carbon 
to the atmosphere. 
Agency Costs 
Vegetation and Fuel 
Treatments 
Treatments are likely to be 
less efficient and more 
costly in IRAs. 
Increased flexibility to achieve 
management objectives in 
critical insect and disease 
areas; increase ability to 
strategically locate 
treatments and improve 
efficiency. 
Capacity to shift even more 
treatment acres into IRAs; 
increased efficiency, 
effectiveness and 
timeliness of wildfire 
suppression response as 
well as fuel reductions in 
CPZs 
Management flexibility is 
similar to Alternative 2, but 
projected treatment 
amounts are lower due to 
constraints imposed by 
more upper tier acreage 
under Alternative 4. 
Other Costs 
Administrative costs are unlikely to change due to flat or static budgets and corresponding constraints on projects. Emphasis on 
road decommissioning and temporary roads is expected to ease demands on maintenance backlog. Overall need to address 
invasive plants is expected to remain relatively constant across alternatives; although new roads can contribute to the spread 
of invasive plants, roads can also be an asset in helping to effectively control invasive populations.

Rural Schools and Self Determination Act and Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) are not expected to change significantly. 
(3) CPZs = community protection zones (0.5 to 1.5 mile buffer area surrounding communities that have been identified as being at-
risk to wildfire. “Potential for fuel treatments” implies that at least one CPZ area in a county overlaps with an IRA or CRA where 
tree-cutting has at least a low likelihood of occurring, according to national forest unit field staff.

BACKGROUND 
 
In January 2001, a Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001 rule) was adopted into regulations at 
36 CFR 294. Since its promulgation, the 2001 rule has continued to be the subject of litigation. 
Ongoing uncertainty about the future of the 2001 rule was a key factor that influenced the 
Governor of Colorado to initiate state-specific protections that would conserve the values and 
characteristics of CRAs. To this end, in May 2005, Colorado enacted Senate Bill 05-243 (C.R.S. 
§ 36-7-302), which directed formation of a 13-person bipartisan taskforce to make 
recommendations to the governor regarding the appropriate management of roadless areas on the 
national forests (NFs) in Colorado. 
 
In November 2006, Colorado Governor Bill Owens used the taskforce’s recommendations as the 
basis for petitioning to the Secretary of Agriculture to undertake state-specific roadless 
rulemaking for Colorado. The State’s petition was considered for rulemaking by the Secretary of 
Agriculture in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, section 553(e) of the U.S. 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Department of Agriculture’s rulemaking procedures 
at 7 CFR §1.28. After Governor Owens submitted the State’s petition to the Department of 
Agriculture, Bill Ritter, Jr. was elected Governor of Colorado. In April 2007, Governor Ritter 
resubmitted the petition with a substantive letter of transmittal. In June 2007, the State and the 
U.S. Forest Service presented the petition with some modifications to the Department’s Roadless 
Area Conservation National Advisory Committee. In August 2007, based on the advisory 
committee’s review and report, the Secretary of Agriculture accepted the State’s petition and 
directed the Forest Service to work in cooperation with the State of Colorado to initiate 
rulemaking (USDA RACNAC 2007).  
 
The State’s petition requested the rulemaking process use the most updated roadless boundaries 
(State of Colorado 2007). Updating roadless area evaluation for Colorado resulted in identifying 
approximately 4.031 million acres or about 29 percent of National Forest System (NFS) lands in 
Colorado, as appropriate for management as Colorado’s roadless areas (fig. 1.2). Based on the 
petition, the State and the Forest Service collaboratively developed the rulemaking (regulatory) 
language for a proposed Colorado Roadless Rule that would govern management of roadless 
areas on NFS lands in Colorado. The draft rule was published July 25, 2008 (FR Vol 73, No. 
144, p. 43544) with solicitation of public comment on the proposed rule as well as the draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (draft EIS). The provisions of a revised proposed rule have 
been developed based on public comment and additional meetings with RACNAC and the State. 
  
This report summarizes the regulatory impact analysis for the revised proposal for the Colorado 
Roadless Rule (proposed rule) as directed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 issued September 
30, 1993, as amended. This executive order addresses regulatory planning and review and 
requires that agencies conduct a regulatory analysis for economically significant regulatory 
actions. Significant regulatory actions are those that have an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more or adversely affect the economy or economic sectors. Total annual output 
associated with oil, gas, and coal production in the affected areas is projected to be 
approximately $970 million under the proposed rule, compared to approximately $1,030 million 
under baseline conditions, implying the annual economic impact of the proposed rule is 
 29 
 
estimated to be a decrease of approximately $60 million for energy mineral sectors. Due to the 
potential magnitude of economic impacts and the level of interest in inventoried roadless area 
management, this rule is designated as significant and is therefore subject to E.O. 12866. 
The Office of Management and Budget Circular A-4 provides guidance to Federal agencies on 
the development of regulatory analysis including the use of benefit-cost analysis. Circular A-4 
also recognizes that “it is not always possible to express in monetary units all of the important 
benefits and costs” and that agencies should exercise “professional judgment in determining how 
important the non-quantified benefits or costs are likely to be in the context of the overall 
analysis.” The guidance also notes that regulatory analyses include a “discussion of non-
quantified as well as quantified benefits and costs.” Included in the analysis of benefits and costs 
should be an assessment of distributional effects and equity. 
 
The proposed rule is programmatic in nature and intended to guide future development of 
proposed actions in roadless areas. This rule does not authorize the implementation of any 
ground-disturbing activities, but rather it describes circumstances under which certain activities 
may be allowed or restricted in roadless areas. Before authorizing land use activities in roadless 
areas, the Forest Service must complete a more detailed and site-specific environmental analysis 
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its implementing regulations at 
40 CFR 1500-1508. Because the proposed rule does not prescribe site-specific activities, it is 
difficult to predict changes in benefits under the different alternatives. It should also be 
emphasized that the types of benefits derived from uses of inventoried roadless areas in Colorado 
are far ranging and include a number of non-market and non-use benefit categories. As a 
consequence, benefits are discussed qualitatively in many sections of this report. 
 
This document summarizes information about the benefits, costs, and distributional effects of the 
proposed rule. For details about resource and/or program-specific environmental effects, the 
reader is referred to the revised draft environmental impact statement (revised DEIS or RDEIS) 
for the proposed rule (USDA Forest Service 2010), as well as resource specialist reports cited in 
the RDEIS. 
 
Changes between the Draft EIS (2008) and the Revised DEIS (2010) 
 
Since the release of the DEIS, court actions, changes to the State’s petition, and updated 
inventories have revised the alternatives and language of the proposed Colorado Roadless Rule.  
These changes are described below. 
The No Action Alternative has changed from Alternative 1 to Alternative 3 
In the DEIS, the Forest Service considered “no action” or baseline conditions to mean that the 
2001 Roadless Rule would remain in effect for IRAs in Colorado.  In August 2008, after the DEIS 
was released, the Wyoming District Court set aside and enjoined the 2001 Roadless Rule. 
Colorado is under the Wyoming Court’s ruling, thus the consequences of taking no action has 
changed.  In the revised DEIS the “no action” means that IRAs in Colorado will be managed 
according to direction set forth in the applicable forest plan (alternative 3).  
Effective Date of Alternative 1 
 30 
 
Because the 2001 Roadless Rule was set aside and enjoined, if this alternative is selected, it will 
become Colorado’s state specific roadless rule.  Therefore the provisions will take effect when 
the Colorado’s rule becomes effective and it would not revoke, suspend, or modify any permit, 
contract, or other legal instrument authorizing the occupancy and use of NFS land issued prior 
to the Colorado rule’s effective date.   
Alternative 2 
Between the DEIS and the revised DEIS, the State of Colorado revised their petition for 
rulemaking.  This has resulted in changes to the language of the proposed Colorado Roadless 
Rule. 
(1) There have been changes to the boundaries of roadless areas.  In 2009, the Omnibus 
Public Lands Act was signed into law and enlarged the Indian Peaks Wilderness by 
1,000 acres; thus removing 1,000 acres from the Indian Peaks Adjacent Area Roadless 
Area.  In addition, there is a net increase of approximately 155,000 acres to be 
managed as CRAs under alternative 2. 
(2) The proposed rule requires that the Regional Forester determine that all tree-cutting, 
sale, and removal within CRAs is consistent with applicable land management 
plans, that it meets one of the tree-cutting exceptions, and that one or more roadless 
area characteristics will be maintained or improved over the long-term (except for 
incidental and personal/administrative use circumstances).  The July 2008 proposed 
Colorado Roadless Rule did not elevate the determination for tree-cutting, sale, or 
removal to the Regional Forester for any tree-cutting exceptions. 
(3) The proposed rule uses the term Community Protection Zone (CPZ) instead of 
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). A CPZ is based on the definition of a WUI in the 
Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA), but is specifically defined in this proposed 
rule as an area one-half mile from the boundary of an at-risk community or an area 
within one and one-half miles from the boundary of an at-risk community where 
any land has a sustained steep slope that creates the potential for wildfire behavior 
endangering the at-risk community; or has a geographic feature that aids in creating 
an effective fire break, such as a river or a ridge top; or where the trees are in 
condition class 3.  
Within the CPZ, tree-cutting, sale or removal is allowed to reduce the wildfire 
hazard to an at-risk community or municipal water supply system. Tree-cutting 
outside of the CPZ is allowed to reduce the wildfire threat to a municipal water 
supply system only. In both instances, projects will focus on small-diameter trees to 
create strategic fuel breaks while retaining large trees to the maximum extent 
practicable as appropriate to the forest type. In the DEIS, a temporary road could be 
constructed in the full area of the CPZ, a maximum of 1.5 miles from the community 
boundary. In this RDEIS, a temporary road can only be constructed within the first ½ 
mile of the CPZ to facilitate the projects.   
(4) Tree-cutting, sale or removal in Colorado Roadless Areas must maintain or improve 
one or more roadless area characteristics.  The July 2008 proposed Colorado 
Roadless Rule did not require that tree cutting, sale, or removal maintain or improve 
roadless characteristics except when the tree-cutting was for the management or 
improvement of wildlife or plant species habitat.  The proposed Colorado Roadless 
 31 
 
Rule expands the requirements to maintain or improve roadless area characteristics 
for all but two of the tree-cutting exceptions.  This finding is not required in these 
two exceptions: (1) where the tree-cutting, sale or removal is incidental to the 
implementation of a management activity not otherwise prohibited; or (2) is needed 
or appropriate for personal or administrative use. 
(5) Tree-cutting, sale or removal is allowed within the CPZ or outside of the CPZ with 
Regional Forester concurrence where needed to suppress or prevent an insect or 
disease epidemic once four factors have been considered.   In addition, if a 
temporary road is needed to facilitate tree-cutting, sale or removal for the prevention 
or suppression of an insect or disease epidemic it is only allowed within the first 
one-half mile of the CPZ. The July 2008 proposed Colorado Roadless Rule did not 
contain any of the four required considerations for tree cutting, sale or removal 
within the CPZs, provide direction on the appropriate responsible official for these 
activities, or describe clearly the circumstances where temporary road construction 
would be allowed to facilitate these activities. 
(6) Linear Construction Zones (LCZs) and linear facilities have been defined and 
addressed.  The July 2008 proposed Colorado Roadless Rule did not address linear 
facilities or LCZs.  A linear facility includes pipelines, electrical power lines, 
telecommunications lines, ditches and canals.  A LCZ is a temporary linear area of 
surface disturbance over 50-inches wide that is used for motorized transport by 
vehicles or construction equipment to install a linear facility. It is not used as a motor 
vehicle route and is not engineered to road specifications.  The proposed Colorado 
Roadless Rule generally prohibits the construction of LCZs unless the construction 
relates to a water conveyance structure, electrical power line or telecommunication 
line or oil and gas pipeline. 
(7) Road construction in support of water conveyance structures, including reservoirs, is 
only allowed for those that have a pre-existing water court decree as of the effective 
date of the Rule.  The July 2008 proposed Colorado Roadless Rule allowed for road 
construction for any existing or future authorized water conveyance structure.  The 
proposed Colorado Roadless Rule limits road construction to only those water 
conveyance structures that have an existing water court decree. 
(8) The area covered by the North Fork Coal Mining exception has changed.  The July 
2008 proposed Colorado Roadless Rule allowed for the construction of temporary 
roads in support of coal mining in the North Fork Coal Mining Area.  The North 
Fork Coal Mining Area included approximately 9,000 acres of the Currant Creek 
CRA that remains in the CRA acreage but has now been removed from this 
exception.   
(9) Any road construction or LCZ construction must not diminish existing native 
cutthroat trout habitat.  The July 2008 proposed Colorado Roadless Rule did not 
specifically address native cutthroat trout.  The proposed Colorado Roadless Rule 
prohibits road or LCZ construction unless the responsible official determines that 
within a native cutthroat trout catchment or identified recovery watershed, road 
construction or a LCZ will not diminish conditions in the water influence zone and 
in the native cutthroat habitat. 
(10) The Colorado Roadless Rule has identified Colorado Roadless Areas upper tier acres 
and provided a set of draft acreage and prohibitions for these acres for public 
 32 
 
comment.  The Colorado Roadless Rule identifies “Colorado Roadless Areas upper 
tier acres” which are specific portions of or entire CRAs.  In the CRAs upper tier 
acres tree-cutting, sale or removal is prohibited unless the Regional Forester 
determines it is needed incidental to the implementation of a management activity 
not otherwise prohibited by the rule; or is needed and appropriate for personal or 
administrative use. Road construction or road reconstruction is prohibited in CRAs 
upper tier acres unless it is needed pursuant to reserved or outstanding rights or as 
provided for by statute or treaty. Alternative 2 identifies 257,400 upper tier acres 
with an additional 304,900 acres being considered as upper tier.   
(11) The term “long-term temporary road” has been eliminated from the Colorado 
Roadless Rule. Roads constructed pursuant to existing oil and gas leases that allow 
road construction and roads constructed pursuant to existing coal leases and future 
coal leases within the North Fork coal mining area will be termed temporary roads. 
Alternative 4. There is a fourth alternative. Alternative 4 has the same prohibitions and 
exceptions as alternative 2. This difference between alternative 2 and 4 is the number of upper 
tier acres identified within the CRAs. This alternative proposes 2,614,200 acres as upper tier and 
follows the same prohibitions with exceptions as listed in #10 above. 
 
Purpose and Need 
 
The Department, the Forest Service, and the State of Colorado are committed to conserving and 
managing roadless areas on NFS lands in Colorado. The purpose and need for action is to 
respond to the Secretary of Agriculture’s acceptance of the State of Colorado’s petition for 
rulemaking on the management of the roadless areas in Colorado.   
In the petition, the State of Colorado has indicated that there is a need to develop state specific 
regulations for the management of Colorado’s roadless areas for the following reasons: 
(1) Roadless areas are important because they are, among other things, sources of 
drinking water, important fish and wildlife habitat, semi-primitive or primitive 
recreation areas, and naturally appearing landscapes. There is a need to provide for 
the preservation of roadless area characteristics.  
As recognized in the 2001 Roadless Rule, tree-cutting, sale or removal and road 
construction/reconstruction have the greatest likelihood of altering and fragmenting 
landscapes, resulting in immediate, long-term loss of roadless area values and 
characteristics and there is a need to generally prohibit these activities in roadless 
areas. 
(2) There is a need to accommodate state specific situations and concerns in Colorado’s 
roadless areas.  These include the following:  
a. the risk of wildfire to communities or municipal water supply systems or insect 
and disease epidemics; 
b. exploration and development of coal resources in the North Fork Coal Mining 
Area; 
c. constructing or maintaining an authorized water conveyance structure operated 
pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree; 
 33 
 
d. accessing current and future electrical power lines; 
e. constructing oil or gas pipelines; and 
f. accommodating existing permitted or allocated ski areas.  
In summary, the Department, the Forest Service, and the State of Colorado agree there is a need 
to provide management direction for the conservation of roadless area values and characteristics 
within roadless areas in Colorado. 
 
Roadless area characteristics and values, as defined in the 2001 rule preamble (66 FR 3244) and 
referred to in the final Colorado Roadless Rule, are summarized as follows:  
 High quality or undisturbed soil, water, or air.  
 Sources of public drinking water.  
 Diversity of plant and animal communities.  
 Habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate, and sensitive species, and for 
those species dependent on large, undisturbed areas of land.  
 Primitive, semi-primitive motorized, and semi-primitive non-motorized.  
 Reference landscapes.  
 Natural-appearing landscapes with high scenic quality.  
 Traditional cultural properties and sacred sites.  
 Other locally identified unique characteristics (e.g., uncommon geological formations, 
unique wetland complexes, unique social/cultural/historical characteristics, areas prized for 
collection of non-timber forest products, or exceptional hunting and fishing opportunities). 
 
Proposed rule and Alternatives 
 
Description of Roadless Area Boundaries 
Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 each provide for a state specific roadless rule; however, the provisions of 
each alternative apply to different roadless inventories.  The alternative 1 and 3 inventory 
generally retains the boundaries and acreage of the 2001 Roadless Rule.  For alternatives 2 and 
4, and as requested in the state’s revised petition, the Forest Service re-examined the boundaries 
and acreage of the 2001 Roadless Rule and other Forest Service lands in Colorado for roadless 
area management.  From this effort, the Forest Service identified portions of the 2001 Roadless 
Rule inventory that were substantially altered and did not possess sufficient roadless area 
characteristics.  In addition, the Forest Service identified areas outside the 2001 Roadless Rule 
inventory that did possess sufficient roadless area characteristics.  Taken together, the exclusion 
of the substantially altered lands and inclusion of additional areas became the CRAs. 
Table 1a displays the comparisons between the IRA inventory in alternatives 1 and 3 and the 
CRA inventory in alternatives 2 and 4.  Overall, the CRAs have a net loss of 57,600 acres in 
roadless from the IRA acres.

1 The 2001 Roadless Rule used the inventoried roadless areas from the Forest Plans that were in effect at the time the 2001 Rule was 
developed, or a roadless inventory that had undergone public involvement.  The date of each Forest’s inventory used for the 2001 
Rule is shown here.  Acreages are from the 2001 Roadless Rule FEIS. 
2 The acres to be used for the rulemaking analysis differ from the acres reported in the RACR FEIS because some Wilderness, 
private, and Special Areas were included in the 2001 roadless inventory.  These acres will not be included in this rulemaking 
analysis as acres to be managed under a Colorado Rule because Congress has already set out specific management for those acres.  
Excluded acres are private and wilderness acres that have been found as mapping errors in the 2001 Rule IRA acres as well as those 
acres in the James Peak and Spanish Peak Wildernesses, the Indian Peaks Wilderness, Bowen Gulch and James Peak Protection 
Areas, Roubideau and Tabeguache Special Areas, Fossil Ridge Recreation Management Area, and the Piedra Special Management 
Unit all designated by Congress but were not excluded from the 2001 RACR inventory.   
  
Description of Alternatives 
The range of alternatives is designed to address the purpose and need and issues described 
above. Each alternative offers a different approach to conservation of roadless area 
characteristics, primarily by providing a different mix of prohibitions on land use activities; 
primarily road construction or reconstruction; linear construction zones (LCZs); and tree-
cutting, sale or removal in roadless areas. Alternative comparison tables at the end of this 
chapter summarize the differences in the design of each alternative as well as the differences in 
the environmental consequences or effects of each alternative.  
 35 
 
The four alternatives analyzed in detail are:  
 Alternative 1: the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (2001 Roadless Rule)1. This 
alternative establishes a state-specific roadless rule for Colorado that retains IRA 
boundaries2 and roadless area management provisions contained in the 2001 Roadless 
Rule for management of roadless areas on NFS land in Colorado.  If a decision is made 
to select this alternative, it will not revoke, suspend, or modify any permit, contract or 
other legal instrument authorizing the occupancy and use of NFS lands issued before the 
effective date of this rulemaking.  
 Alternative 2: Proposed Action, Colorado Roadless Rule. This alternative establishes a 
state-specific roadless rule for Colorado.  It modifies Alternative 2 from the DEIS based 
on public comments and the petition submitted by the State of Colorado.  It is based on 
the tenets of the 2001 Roadless Rule, but provides prohibitions and specific exceptions 
relevant to the State of Colorado. There are 257,400 acres identified as CRA upper tier 
with an additional 304,900 acres as an option to identify as upper tier under this 
alternative. If a decision is made to select this alternative, it will not revoke, suspend, or 
modify any permit, contract or other legal instrument authorizing the occupancy and 
use of NFS lands issued before the date of the rulemaking.  
 Alternative 3: No Action, Forest Plan Direction. This alternative does not establish a 
state specific roadless rule for Colorado and all lands would be managed according to 
forest plan direction. The boundaries of the roadless areas are those designated in each 
forest plan and are the same IRAs as those in alternative 1. 
 Alternative 4: Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier. This 
alternative establishes a state-specific roadless rule for Colorado.  This alternative 
provides the same prohibitions and exceptions as alternative 2. The difference is 
2,614,200 acres are identified as CRAs upper tier acres in this alternative (over 2 million 
more acres in upper tier than alternative 2). If a decision is made to select this 
alternative, it will not revoke, suspend, or modify any permit, contract or other legal 
instrument authorizing the occupancy and use of NFS lands issued before the date of the 
rulemaking. 
Table 1b describes the attributes common to all alternatives, and Table 1c describes more detail 
about the attributes exclusive to each alternative.

Congressional designations Nine congressionally designated areas overlap portions of IRAs, totaling about 185,000 acres. These areas are excluded from 
the roadless areas analyzed in this RDEIS. Those areas would not be subject to state-specific rulemaking. Statutory provisions 
supersede rule (regulatory) provisions. 
Federal and state authorities Numerous federal and state laws, regulations, executive orders, and Forest Service directives would continue to govern 
management of roadless areas on NFS lands in Colorado but would not allow for more activity than allowed by the final rule.  
Forest plans The analysis of alternatives in this EIS is predicated on forest plan direction at the time of the analysis, recognizing that forest 
plans are subject to change over time, and that several plans are currently undergoing revision.  
Rulemaking does not alter forest plans nor the ability to update forest plans through an amendment or revision process.  
Activities in roadless areas must adhere to forest plan direction where it is more restrictive than a roadless rule for specific areas 
and situations. 
Project Specific Environmental 
Analysis 
Although the alternatives establish specific prohibitions with exceptions for certain activities within roadless areas, alternatives do 
not compel or authorize implementation of any ground-disturbing actions in the roadless areas. Should such actions be proposed 
in the future, they must undergo environmental analysis, public involvement, and decision making processes pursuant to the 
NEPA and its associated regulations at 40 CFR §1500-1508.  
Reserved and outstanding 
rights, statutes or treaties 
 Alternatives allow road construction or reconstruction, tree-cutting, sale or removal and other activities in roadless areas that 
are associated with rights allowed by existing laws or treaties. This includes allowing road access, surface occupancy, and use 
of NFS land in roadless areas for purposes of:   
 Accessing private lands within or adjacent to NFS land, as authorized under Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act 
(ANILCA). 
 Accessing NFS lands for exploration and development of locatable minerals (e.g., gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, uranium, and 
tungsten), as authorized under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended. 
 Accessing NFS lands for American Indian land uses, as authorized under various American Indian treaties. 
 Accessing NFS lands to conduct a response action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act (CERCLA), including a natural resource restoration action under CERCLA, Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, or 
the Oil Pollution Act. 
 Accessing NFS lands for a Federal Aid Highway project, as authorized under Title 23 of the U.S. Code (23 USC).  
 37 
 
Existing authorizations  Alternatives allow road construction / reconstruction, tree-cutting, sale or removal, and other activities in roadless areas that are 
associated with valid authorizations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture or designated Forest Service official as of the 
effective date of the rule. These include authorizations granted by permits, contracts, or leases.  
 No alternative affects decisions related to renewal, continuation, or transfer of existing authorizations.  
 Road construction/reconstruction, tree-cutting, sale or removal, motor vehicle uses, and other activities are not prohibited in 
roadless areas where they have been authorized under an existing land use authorization. This includes, but is not limited to, 
activities authorized for:  
 Livestock grazing operations 
 Utility operations  
 Ski area operations  
 Mineral resource extraction operations, pursuant to 36 CFR part 228 regulations 
 Other activities under lands or recreation special use permits, contracts, or leases.   
Other Land Uses Activities that are otherwise not prohibited under the alternatives are permissible in roadless areas.  This includes, but is not 
limited to: 
Prescribed burning 
Trail construction or maintenance (motorized and non-motorized) 
Public hunting, fishing, camping, or other dispersed recreation uses 
Livestock grazing.

Comparison of Tree-cutting, Sale, or Removal by Alternative 
General tree-cutting, sale, and 
removal provisions  
 Tree-cutting, sale, or removal, is generally 
prohibited in roadless areas, with some 
exceptions (see below).  
 In some IRAs, forest plans add more 
restrictions related to conducting this 
activity, to protect other resource values.  
 Tree-cutting for all exceptions is expected 
to be infrequent. 
 Similar to the general prohibition in 
alternative 1, although there are more 
exceptions under this alternative (see 
below). An additional limitation is:  
 The Regional Forester determines the 
activity is consistent with the forest 
plan and one or more of the roadless 
characteristics will be maintained or 
improved over the long-term except 
when tree-cutting is for incidental, 
personal or administrative uses. In 
some CRAs, forest plans add more 
restrictions related to conducting this 
activity to protect other resource 
values. 
 In some IRAs tree-cutting is 
prohibited or limited to protect 
resource values. 
 Forest plans in Colorado generally 
allow tree-cutting for non-timber 
purposes on any NFS lands, 
subject to specific resource 
management direction. Forest plans 
also identify lands suitable for 
timber harvest for timber production 
purposes. 
Tree-cutting, sale, or removal 
for incidental, personal, 
administrative uses 
 This activity is allowed in IRAs: 
 Where incidental to other management 
activities (e.g., road or trail construction or 
maintenance, minerals operations, and 
other authorized uses). 
 For personal or administrative uses, as 
provided for in 36 CFR part 223 (e.g., 
firewood, Christmas trees). 
 Same as alternative 1 within CRAs 
including upper tier acres.  
 Same as alternative 1. 
Tree-cutting, sale, or removal 
in substantially altered areas 
 This activity is not rule-limited in 
substantially altered areas in IRAs and is 
only limited by applicable management 
direction in forest plans. 
 Substantially altered acres have been 
removed from CRAs and are only 
limited by applicable management 
direction in forest plans.  
 This activity is only limited by 
applicable management direction in 
forest plans. 
Tree-cutting to maintain or 
restore ecosystem 
composition and structure 
within the range of variability 
expected to occur under 
natural disturbance regimes of 
the current climatic period 
 An example of this activity given in the rule 
is to reduce the risk of wildfire effects but 
could have other purposes. 
 Generally small-diameter trees and will 
maintain or improve one or more roadless 
characteristics. 
 
 This exception has been narrowed to 3 
specific exceptions to address tree-
cutting to reduce the wildfire hazard to 
an at-risk community or municipal 
water supply system and to address 
insect and disease outbreaks. They 
are described below. 
 Tree-cutting is only limited by 
applicable management direction in 
forest plans.

prevent or suppress an insect or disease 
epidemic. 
 
 This activity is allowed in CRAs within 
the community protection zones (CPZ) 
to prevent or suppress an insect or 
disease epidemic.  Within the first ½ 
mile of the CPZ, there is an associated 
temporary road provision. Not allowed

allowed when the Regional Forester 
determines tree-cutting, sale or 
removal is needed to prevent or 
suppress an insect or disease 
epidemic. Not allowed within CRA 
upper tier acres. 
 To determine whether tree-cutting, sale 
or removal is needed both within and 
outside of the CPZ, the Responsible 
Official, through site-specific NEPA 
analysis, will: 
 determine the opportunity and 
effectiveness of the treatment for 
reducing insect or disease damage, 
 weigh the potential effects of the insect 
or disease epidemic on roadless area 
characteristics over the long-term, 
 weigh the potential effects of the insect 
or disease epidemic on resource 
values outside CRAs, and 
 determine the beneficial and adverse 
effects of tree-cutting, sale or removal 
within a CRA. 
 Such insect and disease projects are 
expected to be infrequent and focus on 
stand composition and structure. 
 The areas are governed by the 
applicable management direction in

where needed to reduce wildland fire 
hazard to an at-risk community or 
municipal water supply system 
 Within the first ½ mile of the CPZ;  
 Within the next one-mile of the CPZ if 
HFRA conditions are met and where 
projects would be within the area of a 
Community Wildfire Protection Plan. If 
no CWPP exists, no projects will be 
proposed in this next one-mile 
 There is an associated temporary road 
provision within the first ½ mile of the 
CPZ. 
 Outside of the CPZ this activity is 
allowed within CRAs, except not in 
upper tier acres, where the Regional 
Forester has determined there is a 
significant risk that a wildland fire 
disturbance event could affect a 
municipal water supply system or the 
maintenance of the system.  A 
significant risk exists where the history 
of fire occurrence and fire hazard 
indicate a serious likelihood that a 
wildland fire disturbance event would 
have adverse effects to a municipal 
water supply system. 
 Such projects will focus on small 
diameter trees to create strategic fuel 
breaks that modify fire behavior while 
large trees will be retained to the 
extent practical, as appropriate to the 
forest type,  
 Projects outside of the CPZ are 
expected to be infrequent.  
 
 Forest plans allow tree-cutting in 
most IRAs for purposes described 
in alternatives 1 or 2, with 
exceptions in some specific 
management areas. 
 Not limited to generally small-

Implications of Related Planning Efforts and Federal Direction 
 
The Council on Environmental Quality asks agencies to look at the effects of their similar and 
different actions to see if they may produce a cumulative effect greater than the sum of the 
effects (synergistic interaction). The Agency has reviewed the proposed Colorado Roadless Rule 
and its alternatives with the Federal direction listed below for any possible cumulative effects. 
The directions selected are those the Agency determined were most likely to have an influence 
on or from the Colorado Roadless Rule. While it is possible that changes to roadless area 
conservation could happen at a national scale, by future congressional or Executive action, these 
possibilities for change are too speculative and therefore, not analyzed. After review, the Agency 
found there would be no cumulative effect because all these directions are procedural and do not 
require a specific action to take place. However, as noted in the discussions below, the Agency 
has determined that the Colorado Roadless Rule, 2001 rule, and other state-specific rules may 
affect site-specific projects or plans designed to follow some of these procedural directions. 
 
Forest Service Budget  
The Forest Service budget is part of the annual budget appropriations for the Department of 
Interior and Related Agencies. From fiscal year (FY) 2000 through FY 2011, the portion of the 
Forest Service budget devoted to wildland fire management has steadily increased from 25% to 
over 40%. For the foreseeable future, the Agency expects to have a “flat” or declining budget, 
with nearly half of the budget going to fire management. A flat budget will not allow the Agency 
to increase funding for proposed projects in inventoried roadless areas over the current level 
nationally, regionally, and within the State of Colorado. There will also be little funding to deal 
with the backlog of road and facilities work. Priority is expected to continue to be given to 
projects and proposals in response the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) and the 
Energy Policy Act of 2005. Those effects are discussed below. 
 
Planning Rule 
On April 21, 2008, the Agency published 36 CFR 219 National Forest System Land 
Management Planning Proposed rule (the 2008 Planning Rule) in the Federal Register. 
However, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California invalidated the 
2008 rule, holding that it was developed in violation of the NEPA and the Endangered Species 
Act. The district court vacated the 2008 rule, enjoined the USDA from further implementing it 
and remanded it to the USDA for further proceedings (Citizens for Better Forestry v. USDA, 632 
F. Supp. 2d 968 (N.D. Cal. 2009)). . The Forest Service is currently operating under the 
transition provisions of the 2000 planning rule, as an interim measure until a new planning rule is 
issued. The 2000 planning rule allows forests to develop, revise, and amend forest plans using 
the procedures of the 1982 planning rule. 
 
On December 18, 2009, the Agency issued a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact 
statement for a new planning rule, starting a new planning rule revision. The new planning rule is 
expected to improve public participation in decisionmaking. The emphasis of the proposed rule 
on collaboration, use of science, and monitoring and evaluation will contribute to the long-term 
sustainability and health of NFS lands. 
 51 
 
The current planning rule as clarified is procedural only, and does not cause NFs and grasslands 
to make decisions contrary to other national rules like the 2001 rule. However, the 2001 rule and 
any future state-specific rules will have an indirect effect on forest plan revision efforts under 
any Agency planning rule, as they would restrict certain types of actions on those lands affected 
by the rule. Agency line officers may not be able to change those restrictions during the land 
management plan revision process. Conversely, as with the 2001 rule, during individual forest 
plan development in Colorado, it is anticipated that forest supervisors and regional foresters 
would consider plan alternatives that would, in the long-term, more closely mirror the goals 
established under the Colorado Roadless Rule. This alignment would not increase or decrease 
acreage, but would better parallel the types of activities and/or restrictions allowed. It is not 
anticipated all lands affected by the rule would conform during land management planning for a 
variety of reasons, including wildlife management issues, recreational demands, fiscal concerns, 
and congressional action. This would also be true if other state-specific rules are promulgated. 
 
The Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing the procedural provisions of 
NEPA define a cumulative effect as “the impact on the environment which results from the 
incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
future actions regardless of what Agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such 
other actions” (40 CFR § 1508.7).  
For cumulative impacts to accrue there must first be an impact from the action under review that 
can then be added to the impacts of other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions. 
The current planning rule establishes administrative procedures. It does not dictate how 
administrative units of the NFS are to be managed or the mix of uses on any or all units of the 
NFS. Consequently, there are no direct or indirect effects from the planning rule that can be 
aggregated with any effects of the Colorado Roadless Rule.  
It is anticipated the Agency will continue with its “two-filter” approach for compliance with 
either the Roadless Area Conservation Rule or the State Petitions for Inventoried Roadless Area 
Management Rule and with the portion of land management plans covering those IRAs. This 
means, that no matter which roadless rule is in place, the procedures of the planning rule would 
not affect the provisions of the roadless rule. Neither would individual land management plans 
developed, revised, or amended under the planning rule affect provisions of the roadless rule. 
However, the Agency recognizes the 2001 rule or State-specific roadless rule would place 
constraints on individual IRAs in individual land management plans. In the case of the proposed 
Colorado Roadless Rule, the proposed rule seeks to narrow differences between the rule and land 
management plans. Therefore, a responsible official’s discretion on the development, 
amendment, or revision of individual land management plans developed under any planning rule 
(all alternatives) would be constrained to ensure compliance with any roadless rule in effect for 
the specific IRAs. 
Travel Management Rule 
In response to its growing backlog in road maintenance and the increase of motorized cross-
country travel, the Agency implemented its travel management regulations in November 2005. 
(70 FR 68264). This rule requires the designation of routes (roads and trails) on each NF and 
grassland. The public is allowed to participate. Motor vehicle use outside of designated routes 
will be prohibited. This is a procedural rule and there is no mandated outcome that would affect 
 52 
 
this Colorado Roadless Rule. Additionally, the Governor of Colorado has specifically stated his 
desire to keep travel management separate from the State’s roadless petition.  
 
However, the Agency recognizes as each NF and grassland finishes their travel management 
process, there will be areas in IRAs where roads are determined to be no longer warranted. 
Eventually, these roads will be decommissioned and the area will recover or otherwise improve 
its roadless characteristics. Ecotypes which have faster growing vegetation will visually recover 
faster. These are generally found in the South, southeast Alaska, and areas west of the Cascades 
and Sierra Nevada Mountains (Pacific coast). If some of these areas are large enough or are 
adjoining existing roadless or wilderness areas, they may eventually be considered for wilderness 
recommendation through the Agency’s forest plan revision process (Planning Rule). Because the 
2001 rule did not provide for inclusion or exclusion of areas (36 CFR §294.14e) they would not 
be included under its prohibitions.3 Changes to the 2001 rule prohibitions would come through 
individual rulemaking like this effort for Colorado. 
 
Forest Service NEPA Procedures 
The Agency has promulgated a procedural rule to guide its implementation of NEPA. Although 
the Final Rule includes some changes, most of the Agency’s prior NEPA procedures found in 
agency directives were moved to regulation unchanged including categorical exclusions. No 
cumulative effects are expected from these actions because these are procedural requirements, 
which do not have effects on the human environment. 
 
Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) of 2003 
The Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) (Pub.L. 108-148), provides processes for 
implementing hazardous fuel reduction projects on certain types of "at-risk" NFS and Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) lands. It also provides other authorities and direction to help reduce 
hazardous fuel and restore healthy forest and rangeland conditions on lands of all ownerships. 
When implementing hazardous fuel reduction projects, HFRA protects existing old growth 
stands and “[f]ocuses largely on small diameter trees, thinning, strategic fuel breaks, and 
prescribed fire to modify fire behavior, as measured by the projected reduction of 
uncharacteristically severe wildfire effects for the forest type (such as adverse soil impacts, tree 
mortality or other impacts);” and “maximizes the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the 
forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fires-resilient stands”4  
 
The establishment of WUI areas and CWPPs helps to implement the Act. At the national-level, 
the majority of WUIs areas are not in IRAs; however, there are overlaps. WUI distances vary by 
individual CWPP.5 These plans are developed following A Collaborative Approach for Reducing 
Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment: 10-Year Comprehensive Strategy 
(2001).  
 
                                                 
3 Section 294.14(e) states: The prohibitions and restrictions established in this subpart are not subject to 
reconsideration, revision, or rescission in subsequent project decisions or land and resource management plan 
amendments or revisions undertaken pursuant to 36 CFR part 219. 
4 See Sections 102(e) and (f) of HFRA 
5 The definition of Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) is found at Section 101 (16) of the Healthy Forest Restoration 
Act of 2003 
 53 
 
Except for the effects discussed in the body of the EIS on the implementation of the Act, the 
proposed rule and its alternatives will have no effect on hazardous fuel reduction projects outside 
the State of Colorado. 
 
Energy Policy Act of 2005 
Key provisions of the Act provide for the development of streamline procedures for energy 
exploration and development, but the Act does not direct energy development in areas, such as 
IRAs. In response to the Act, a programmatic EIS (PEIS) has been developed by a multi-agency 
team to designate a system of West-wide energy corridors. This PEIS recognizes the Agency’s 
policy on IRAs.  Any proposal derived from West-wide energy corridor designation will be 
subject to this rule. 
 
 
METHODS, DATA, AND ASSUMPTIONS 
 
Scope of Analysis  
 
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars as well as guidance regarding E.O. 
12866 indicate that regulatory impact analysis should include benefit cost analysis, as well as an 
assessment of distributional effects. This report summarizes the benefits, costs, and distributional 
effects of three alternatives referred to as follows: 2001 rule, the forest plans alternative, and the 
Colorado Roadless Rule (proposed rule) (see section “Proposed Action and Alternatives” for 
details about management direction under the alternatives). The term roadless areas, as used 
throughout this chapter, generally refer to both the IRAs and CRAs. 
 
The scope of this rulemaking consists of broad regulatory management prohibitions and 
exceptions. This is not a proposal for implementing any site-specific projects or activities in 
roadless areas. When a specific action is proposed for implementation in a roadless area, it would 
undergo environmental analysis and public review pursuant to NEPA before implementation 
could be authorized. 
 
Commensurate with the broad geographic scale of this rule—covering more than 4 million acres 
of land—and the lack of any site-specific proposed projects or activities; the potential effects are 
primarily described in qualitative and comparative terms. The analysis of potential effects relies 
on resource information readily available from geographic information system (GIS) map 
coverage, resource inventory databases, and resource specialist reports (see chapter 3 of the 
RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010)). 
 
The two primary activities that differ between the alternatives are (1) roading, and (2) tree-
cutting and removal. These two activities have the greatest likelihood of altering and fragmenting 
landscapes with a result of immediate, long-term loss of roadless area values and characteristics. 
Thus, to set the stage for subsequent sections, this section describes the relative differences in the 
amount of tree-cutting and roading projected to occur in roadless areas over the next 15 years. 
Projecting the potential for future tree-cutting and roading activities in roadless areas beyond a 
15-year time horizon would be overly speculative in the context of this analysis.  
 
 54 
 
Budgetary constraints include an assumption that the congressionally appropriated budget would 
remain flat over the next 15 years. Forest plan direction is another factor that constrains activities 
in roadless areas. Roading and tree-cutting are restricted in roadless areas wherever the 
applicable forest plan direction is more restrictive than what is allowed under each alternative. 
 
Benefits and Costs 
 
Because the proposed rule does not prescribe site-specific activities, it is difficult to predict the 
benefits and costs of the different alternatives. In addition, the types of benefits derived from 
roadless characteristics and the uses of roadless areas are far ranging and include a number of 
non-market and non-use benefit categories that are difficult to measure in monetary terms. The 
rule potentially affects opportunities associated with future resource access and availability. As a 
consequence, benefits are not monetized, nor are net present values or benefit cost ratios 
estimated. Instead, increases and/or losses in benefits are discussed in a quantitative or 
qualitative manner in the context of the following measures: 
 Changes in private sector opportunities associated with activities permitted or precluded 
(e.g., coal, oil and gas),  
 Changes in non-market goods and services, ecosystem services, and sources of non-use 
benefits (e.g., recreational opportunities, forest health and wildfire management 
conditions, water quality provision, wilderness characteristics, status of threatened 
species) indirectly affected by activities permitted or precluded on roadless areas under 
the alternatives, and 
 Agency costs and revenues accruing to the Forest Service (e.g., financial efficiency) from 
activities directly affected by the proposed rule. 
 
The assessment of benefits and costs begins by distinguishing between the creation of potential 
opportunities and the projection of reasonably foreseeable activities. Potential opportunities for 
generating goods and services are affected by the extent to which activities are permitted in 
roadless areas under each alternative. Projections of reasonable foreseeable activities take into 
account area-specific data and evidence regarding resource utilization and development trends, 
location of resources, and other factors affecting the likelihood that land will be used for specific 
uses. This information is aggregated into assumptions about reasonably foreseeable flows of 
goods (e.g., coal, oil and gas production), services (e.g., reduction of risks from wildfire in the 
wildland urban interface), and resource utilization and then used to project activity levels (tree-
cutting, roading) for each alternative over a 15 year time period. See “Data Sources” for details 
about estimates of projected activity levels. Projected activity levels can also be used to describe 
potential changes in benefits derived from roadless characteristics. Details about the derivation 
of activity projections are described in the revised DEIS for the proposed action (USDA Forest 
Service 2010), as well as the resource specialist reports supporting the RDEIS, and are not 
reiterated in this regulatory impact analysis document. 
Benefits and costs are organized and discussed in the context of ‘local resource challenges’ and 
‘roadless characteristics’ in an effort to remain consistent with the overall purpose of the 
proposed rule, recognizing that benefits associated with local concerns may trigger indirect 
benefits in the roadless characteristics in some cases (e.g., forest health). Access and 
designations for motorized versus non-motorized recreation are topics raised in comments during 
 55 
 
scoping, however, the proposed rule does not provide direction on where and when OHV use 
would be permissible and makes clear that travel planning-related actions should be addressed 
through travel management planning and individual land management plans. 
A number of resource and service areas are assessed in detail in chapter 3 of the RDEIS, but the 
differences in impacts to or from many of these resources or services are found to be minimal or 
insignificant across alternatives and therefore not discussed in detail in this report. These areas 
include livestock grazing, saleable minerals, other leasable minerals), locatable minerals6, 
recreational special uses (including outfitters and guides), and non-timber products. 
 
Distributional Effects 
 
The details about economic impact analysis for this report are provided in the revised Economics 
Specialist Report (USDA Forest Service 2010b). Distributional effects are discussed in the 
context of (1) changes in jobs and income for sectors where measurable output differs 
significantly across alternatives, (2) changes in revenue sharing (payments to states and counties) 
associated with receipts from sectors where output differs significantly, and (3) changes in 
opportunities for protecting values at risk in communities and counties adjacent to roadless areas. 
 
Economic impact analysis is used to evaluate potential direct, indirect, and induced effects on the 
economy. Economic impacts are estimated using input-output analysis. Input-output analysis is a 
means of examining relationships in an economy, both between businesses and between 
businesses and final consumers. It captures all monetary market transactions for consumption in 
a given time period. The resulting mathematical representation allows one to examine the effect 
of a change in one or several economic activities on an entire economy, all else constant.  This 
examination is called impact analysis.  IMPLAN (Minnesota IMPLAN Group 2003) translates 
changes in final demand for goods and services into resulting changes in economic effects, such 
as labor income and employment of the affected area’s economy.  The IMPLAN modeling 
system allows the user to build regional economic models of one or more counties for a 
particular year. The regional model for this analysis uses the 2006 IMPLAN data to be consistent 
with the model used for the analysis of the first proposed Colorado Roadless Rule and DEIS 
completed in 2008. IMPLAN was used to estimate regional or local economic impacts and the 
data used are compliant with the Data Quality Act (Section 515 of Public Law 106-554). The 
IMPLAN multipliers are derived from a specific set of cross-sectional data regarding 
employment, output, and expenditures from a single point in time (i.e., year). There is 
uncertainty associated with predicted impacts from the use of multipliers, but the uncertainty is 
expected to have a consistent effect on projected impacts across alternatives. As a consequence, 
greater attention should be focused on the relative differences in impacts across alternatives, and 
not the absolute values or precision of the predicted impacts; projected impacts are 
approximations. 
 
To provide a statewide context for the analysis, all Colorado counties were organized into four 
model areas. Table 2 summaries the counties in each of these model areas. Figure 1 is map 
displaying the county composition of each model area. 
                                                 
6 None of the alternatives affect rights of reasonable access to prospect and explore lands open to mineral entry and 
development of valid claims under the General Mining Laws of 1872.

      Figure 1. Colorado Roadless Analysis: Economic Impact Model Areas 
 
 
Natural gas and coal industry sectors, potentially affected by roadless area management, are 
primarily in five western slope counties:  Delta, Garfield, Mesa, Montrose, and Rio Blanco.  The 
physical locations of natural gas and coal resources are found in other counties around the State 
of Colorado, but these locations are either (1) not affected by roadless management alternatives 
or (2) are isolated with somewhat small deposits.  Pitkin and Gunnison Counties are exceptions 
to this characterization. 
Important natural gas and coal resources associated with roadless areas are in the northwest 
corners of Pitkin and Gunnison Counties7.  Development of these resources would likely impact 
jobs and labor income in the five counties noted above rather than in the counties where the 
deposits are located.  Labor and material flows to the resource locations, as well as production 
transport after extraction, are far more likely to impact Mesa, Garfield, and Delta Counties 
instead of Pitkin and Gunnison Counties.  Two coal mining operations in Gunnison County 
currently provide a good example of these flows.  Nearly all employees working at the mines 
                                                 
7 Other counties within the San Juan basin (e.g., Archuleta, Mineral) have gas reserves and roadless area boundaries 
that change by alternative in Archuleta. However, oil and gas development is not projected to vary by alternative in 
the San Juan basin (see Energy and Minerals section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010)). 
 58 
 
live in Delta, Montrose, and Mesa Counties.  All the coal is transported out of the area down the 
North Fork Valley by rail. 
 
For the reasons cited above, the economic impacts for oil, gas, and coal are modeled using only 
Delta, Garfield, Mesa, Montrose, and Rio Blanco Counties to represent changes in oil and gas 
production. Total annual production for the respective energy sectors (see “Distributional 
Effects: Economic Impacts” section for details about energy mineral production and output value 
estimation) are multiplied by current prices to estimate annual production value. The energy 
minerals model relies on annual production value to estimate employment (jobs/year) and labor 
income ($/year) contributed or supported by reasonably foreseeable projections of annual oil, 
gas, and coal production values. 
For calculating fiscal impacts associated with revenue sharing (mineral lease payments – see 
Local Governments section), output values, by activity and alternative, have been allocated by 
county based on acres leased and/or available on which roads are allowed, as presented in the 
Energy Minerals section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). The model8 has been 
adjusted to fully account for all coal mining operations in Gunnison County. The Energy 
Roadless model area includes a variety of communities, ranging from small towns – such as 
Somerset – to the economic center of western Colorado – Grand Junction. 
Protecting values-at-risk from wildfire in communities near roadless areas is a function, in part, 
of fuel treatment opportunities to reduce fuels in the wildland urban interface (WUI), as 
represented by the community protection zones (CPZs) which are defined as buffer areas ranging 
from 0.5 and 1.5 miles beyond at-risk communities. The communities that could potentially 
benefit from protection are assumed to be represented by those CPZs that overlap roadless areas 
where tree-cutting for fuel treatments is projected to be likely or highly likely under each 
alternative (see Fire Ecology and Fuels and Economic Impacts sections in this document for 
details). 
 
 
  
                                                 
8 The model is developed using IMPLAN and is based on economic data from 2006. For details about the economic 
model development and application, see Economic section of the DEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2008). 
 59 
 
 
Baseline Description and Assumptions 
 
For the purpose of regulatory impact analysis, Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3) is assumed 
to be the no action alternative to represent baseline conditions or goods and services provided by 
national forests and grasslands in the near future in the absence of the proposed rule. The 
baseline assumption is consistent with no action alternative used in the revised DEIS for the 
proposed rule (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Time Frame and Geographic Scope 
 
Environmental effects analysis for the different resource and service areas completed for the  
RDEIS for the proposed rule focuses primarily on a 15 year period, typical of a planning period. 
As such, the assessment of benefits, costs, and distributional effects (economic impacts) 
associated with projected activity levels also adopt a 15 year time period of analysis. The 
management direction associated with the alternatives applies to CRAs under the proposed rule 
and IRAs under the 2001 rule and the Forest Plans alternative. As such, the geographic scope of 
direct impacts from the proposed rule is primarily the State of Colorado; however, it is 
recognized that the scope of non-use benefits from roadless characteristics may extend well 
beyond local or State populations, up to the nation. Distributional effects and some benefit 
categories are characterized in the context of economic areas in Colorado, as noted above, to 
more accurately capture the direct, indirect, and induced effects of renewable and non-renewable 
commodity impacts.  
 
Data Sources 
 
The results discussed in this report are often based on analyses presented in the RDEIS for the 
proposed rule (USDA Forest Service 2010) as well as separate resource Specialist Reports (e.g., 
Minerals, Social and Economics, Recreation) completed to support and cited in the RDEIS. As 
such, this report makes frequent reference to the RDEIS and specialist reports to avoid the 
burden of reproducing analyses already presented in other supporting documentation; the reader 
is encouraged to review those reports and chapter 3 of the RDEIS for details about 
environmental effects as well as sources of data and information for effects analysis. Examples 
of data sources cited in specialist reports include:

 Region 2 INFRA database for roads 
 Region 2 Cumulative Set Aside Program Analysis worksheets, by Forest unit 
 LANDFIRE Rapid Assessment (RA) data for fire regime condition class 
 Forest Health Composite Maps for insect and disease risk

 BLM and USGS reports and leasable minerals databases for coal, and oil+gas 
reserves.

 State 303(d)/305(b) Reports: Lists of Impaired Waters. 
Public comments on the proposed rule were considered. In addition, each forest provided 
information regarding projected tree-cutting, harvest volumes, and roading that would likely 
occur in CRAs and substantially altered areas under each alternative for the proposed rule; no 
changes were made to this information for the proposed rule and RDEIS. Projections for activity 
levels consider flat budget trends. Each resource area section in the RDEIS provides further 
descriptions of the information used to project activity levels (USDA Forest Service 2010). 
 
Analysis Area for Road Construction and Tree-Cutting Projections 
 
The area of analysis is limited to National Forest System (NFS) lands roadless areas within the 
state of Colorado.  Roadless areas in Colorado are generally undeveloped areas, typically 
exceeding 5,000 acres and meet the minimum criteria for inclusion in the National Wilderness 
Preservation System.  These areas were identified through a variety of assessments and 
inventories including, the Forest Service’s Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II) 
processes, and forest planning.  
While the areas and acreages for each alternative are different, the analysis area for all of the 
alternatives covers the same number of acres in order to compare the environmental effects of 
each alternative.  The alternatives differ in terms of which acres would be managed according to 
a roadless rule and forest plan direction and which acres would be managed according to 
direction in the forest plan direction only.  Table 3 displays the number of acres of the analysis 
area that would be managed according to a roadless rule and how many acres would be 
managed according to the forest plan under each alternative.

contain roadless area characteristics would be managed according to the respective forest plans. 
Alternative 2 identifies 4.19 million acres (3,776,500 acres of the 2001 Roadless Rule IRAs and an 
additional 409,500 acres that were found to have roadless area characteristics) that would be 
managed according to the forest plan and the Colorado Roadless Rule. The 467,100 acres that 
includes permitted or forest plan allocated ski area acres and those that have been substantially 
altered would be managed according to the respective forest plans.  This alternative designates 
257,400 acres as CRA upper tier acres; with an additional 304,900 acres that are being 
considered for upper tier, labeled as optional upper tier acres. 
Alternative 3 would require that all of the acres within the analysis area be managed according 
to the respective forest plans.  
Alternative 4 identifies 4.19 (3,776,500 acres of the 2001 Roadless Rule IRAs and an additional 
409,500 acres that were found to have roadless area characteristics) that would be managed 
according to the forest plan and the Colorado Roadless Rule.  The 467,100 acres that includes 
permitted or forest plan allocated ski area acres and those that have been substantially altered 
would be managed according to the respective forest plans.  This alternative designates 
2,614,200 acres as CRA upper tier acres. 
 
Projections of roading and tree-cutting activities are made based on the analysis area description 
above. 
 
Road Construction and Reconstruction (roading) 
 
The projections are not equivalent to a proposal for an action. All projections for road 
construction or reconstruction are annual averages and can be expected to vary from year to 
year. The projections are based on the exceptions for road construction or reconstruction that 
may occur in roadless areas under the alternatives along with the assumptions described above. 
The projections do not identify roads that may be needed in response to emergencies. The 
greatest number of road miles for all activities is projected to occur under Alternative 3 
 62 
 
followed by Alternatives 2, 4 and 1 respectively.  The majority of road construction or 
reconstruction would take place in areas previously leased for oil and gas development, and 
coal extraction, and for hazardous fuels reduction (adjacent to communities). Details are 
outlined below.

Table 4 shows projected road construction across alternatives for ‘general purposes’. Table 5 
displays the annual projections for road construction and reconstruction by alternative that 
could occur in the analysis area for coal development. 
The majority of projected coal-related temporary roads are for exploration or methane drainage 
purposes, and these would be on the landscape for 2-5 years. A small number of coal roads 
access ventilation shafts and monitoring facilities that are expected to be on the landscape for 30 
years or more. The projections for roads associated with coal lease, exploration and 
development were based on a 39,600 acres analysis area.  The 39,600 acre analysis area is the 
only place on NFS lands in Colorado where economically viable coal resources are presently 
being developed. There are 7,100 acres currently leased within the 39,600 acre analysis area. Of 
the 7,100 acres leased, 5,900 acres are within IRAs and 4,000 acres are within CRAs. No 
additional coal could be leased within the IRAs under alternative 1. Alternatives 2 and 4 allow 
additional coal leasing in the CRAs only within the 20,000 acre North Fork coal mining area; 
where approximately 15,630 acres are not currently leased. Alternative 3 allows additional coal 
leasing within the entire 39,600 acre analysis area.

Road construction and reconstruction for oil and gas development would occur almost 
exclusively on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison (GMUG) and White River 
National Forests.   
Overall, alternative 3 projects the greatest number of miles of road construction or 
reconstruction because under the other alternatives all future oil and gas leases as of the date of 
the Colorado Rule must have a no road construction stipulation.  Under alternatives 2 and 4, 
roads for this purpose are only temporary and would not become forest or permanent roads.

Under alternatives 1 and 3 they are considered forest or administrative roads and could become 
permanent roads if determined appropriate according to the forest plan.

Tree-cutting and Removal 
 
The projections are not equivalent to a proposal for an action. Projections are based on the 
exceptions under the alternatives where tree-cutting, sale and removal may occur in roadless 
areas under the four alternatives along with the assumptions described above.  All projections 
for tree-cutting, sale or removal are annual averages and can be expected to vary from year to 
year. For each alternative, projections considered areas within the analysis area for the next 15 
years.  Table 9 displays the purpose for and number of acres where tree-cutting, sale, or 
removal is projected to occur under the alternatives over the next 15 years. The greatest number 
of acres where tree-cutting, sale or removal is projected to occur is under alternative 3 followed 
by alternatives 2, 4 and 1 respectively.  More information about the likelihood of tree-cutting, 
sale or removal activities, including projected acreages for each aspect of the analysis area 
within each roadless area is contained in Appendix D of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010).

Benefits and Costs 
 
Overview of Benefits Associated with Roadless Areas 
 
Benefits and costs are divided into two parts: 1) those which are financial and captured in the 
fiscal records of the Forest Service, and 2) those which are realized by any organization or 
individual. Financial considerations include revenues and costs from the perspective of the 
Forest Service or other government agencies. Other benefits and costs can be realized by users of 
roadless areas in NFs, including backpackers, hunters, viewers of wildlife, permitted outfitters 
and guides, ski areas, ranchers, timber processors, and water users. Other benefits and costs can 
also be realized by those who never set foot in CRAs areas and/or who desire the retention of 
wildland characteristics for their children.  
 
The word “value” can have a variety of meanings. In one sense, value can mean that which is 
desirable or worthy for its own sake. In another, value can mean a fair or equivalent in terms of 
money or commodities (Freeman, 2003). Economics considers value in the latter sense, using 
tradeoffs to determine the “equivalence.” Often these values and tradeoffs are expressed in 
monetary terms. At other times where monetary expressions are not available, value and 
tradeoffs are considered in qualitative terms. In this section, tradeoffs are discussed qualitatively.  
 
In considering the financial benefits and costs of roadless area management alternatives in 
Colorado, revenues to the government can range from none to very high. Few revenues are 
typically obtained when road access is not permitted. At times, revenues in roadless areas might 
be limited to permit fees from outfitters and guides and livestock grazing. Conversely, road 
access can provide opportunities for large revenues, such as when leasable minerals are present 
and recoverable. Financial costs can also vary widely.  
 
 68 
 
In considering non-financial benefits and costs of roadless area management, both market and 
non-market goods and services can vary widely. Market goods or services are those for which 
one can observe transactions in the marketplace. Water rights, ski lift tickets, and the sale of 
cattle which graze on public lands are some examples of market values that are not captured in 
the financial records of government agencies. When road building and vegetative treatments are 
not allowed, these values may be minimal or non-existent. With roads and treatment options, 
these uses of roadless areas have a greater opportunity to develop and market values are realized. 
 
Goods and services not found in the marketplace are also affected by roadless area management. 
Non-market goods and services are those for which there are no observable transactions. The 
value of these benefits are often estimated by economists using “willingness to pay” concepts 
(Peterson et al., 1988). Examples of non-market benefits include dispersed recreation, viewing 
scenery and wildlife, solitude, health benefits, biological diversity, and ecosystem functions. 
Another group of benefits includes those who desire to retain options for the future use, either for 
themselves or for others. All of these pertain to roadless areas in Colorado, and can potentially be 
affected by road or vegetative treatment activities. 
 
Preferences and Values Affected by Alternatives 
 
Since its inception, the Forest Service has managed NFS lands according to the principle of 
multiple-use.  Multiple-use allows the Agency to manage land for a variety of uses, including 
amenity, commodity, noncommodity, recreation, and access. Designating certain areas for 
selected types of management requires consideration of not only the resources or commodities, 
but also of the full range of people’s values. Because Americans show diverse orientations to 
these resources, the use, management, and designation of national forest lands is often inherently 
controversial. For details about the discussion below, see the Social Assessment section in 
chapter 3 of the RDEIS. 
 
Likewise, management designation for roadless areas in Colorado is controversial.  One of the 
central questions that frame the debate is commodity and noncommodity uses and how they can 
be balanced.  Whereas people once valued NFs primarily for sources of commodities (e.g., 
timber, minerals, other goods traded in open markets), people’s values for NFs have shifted 
toward recreation, environmental qualities, aesthetics, and amenities (e.g., non-market goods and 
services).  Another central question for roadless area management is access, particularly for the 
designation of motorized and nonmotorized areas and how they can be balanced.  This topic was 
raised in public comments for this rulemaking, but is better addressed in independent travel 
management planning (see section “Implications of Related Planning Efforts” in this report). 
 
Forest values represent the importance and worth that people have assigned to CRAs.  Forest 
values include, but are not limited to, aesthetic (e.g., scenery), biological diversity, cultural, 
economic/markets, bequest (consideration of future generations), ecosystem services/life 
sustaining, recreation, spiritual, subsistence, and existence/intrinsic (no direct or indirect use of 
forest is needed to gain value). People can hold multiple values for the same resource or may 
hold very separate values for specific places or experiences. The same place or roadless area will 
have different values to different people. 
 
 69 
 
The values and interests associated with roadless area management in Colorado can be identified 
from responses to comments the public has provided during the 2001 rule comment periods, the 
2006 Colorado Task Force public hearings, and to the 2007 Colorado Roadless Rulemaking 
Notice of Intent and 2008 proposed rule comment periods. This is not a random sample; people 
who chose to respond to any Forest Service comment period are self-selected. By focusing on 
those who commented, the analysis focuses on those people who hold strong values regarding 
roadless area resources. A total of nine broad categories of roadless values/interests are identified 
(see Table 10) and can be used to display the differences between alternatives, recognizing that 
value categories do not define specific individuals or groups. 
 
Table 10.  Forest value/interest categories used for Colorado Roadless Area analysis 
Value/Interest Category Defined for Colorado roadless area analysis 
Conservation  Values the balance of roadless area management between active management of 
resources for use and areas where natural processes dominate. 
Industry Access Values commercial activities in roadless areas such as timber, oil and gas 
development, mining, coal extraction, utilities, and other uses where appropriate.  
Value future access as needed to facilitate continued resource development and 
support of resource jobs and income. 
Preservation Values roadless areas for the natural processes and opportunities provided without 
additional management or infrastructure development.  Much of the value is in 
knowing roadless areas exist and are protected from future development rather than 
values associated with actual use or visitation.   
Recreational use –  
motorized  
Value focuses on maintaining current motorized use of roadless areas for 
recreational opportunities, as well as, where appropriate, increasing backcountry 
motorized opportunities in the future, which may be trails/single-track rather than 
roads. 
Recreational use –  
non motorized 
Values maintaining or expanding non-motorized opportunities in roadless areas.  
There is some division in this category between those interested in mechanized use 
(mountain bikes) and those who would like to limit access to hiking and horses.  
Overall the desire is for quiet/non motorized experiences in roadless areas. 
Roaded access  Values gaining access via roads to the forest, including roadless areas.  For some, 
driven by need or disability, the desire for roaded access is due to the inability to get 
into the forest without the road system.  For others, desire for additional roaded 
access is the preferred method of travel, the travel itself is the recreational 
experience. 
Tourism (including ski 
resorts) 
This category is another commercial interest, but capitalizing on the roadless areas 
as a natural amenity that attracts customers to the area for leisure activities.  Scenery 
is of concern to this category, but the value of roading depends on the types of 
experiences the operation is providing. 
Wilderness Values roadless areas as roadless so those areas can be included in the wilderness 
system in the future.  This category focuses on future primitive and protected 
wilderness experiences and wilderness resources. 
Wildland urban interface This category is specific to those activities in WUI or CWPP acres that overlap in 
roadless areas where vegetation treatments are desired to reduce hazards of wildfire.  
This category values reducing wildfire hazards to houses and communities no matter 
the location.  This category does not focus on individuals living in the WUI. 
 
Table 11 demonstrates how individuals or groups who share or hold the respective values may 
respond to the alternatives. Some interests are more adaptable to differences between 
alternatives, and so more than one of the alternatives may be acceptable.  Other interests are 
specific in their needs and values of roadless area resources, even small variations in potential 
impacts can result in undesired outcomes.  The actual response of any group or individual to 
 70 
 
activities related to roadless area management will depend on location, substitute sites, timing, 
mitigation measure, and other trends and events occurring outside Forest Service control.

As noted in the section regarding “Purpose and Need,” the proposed rule aims to provide greater 
management flexibility to address unique and local land management challenges while 
continuing to conserve roadless values and characteristics. State or local concerns revolve around 
commodity utilization (e.g., oil and gas, coal), access, forest health, and implications of forest 
health on community conditions (e.g., risk from severe wildfires). Roadless characteristics 
include a number of benefit categories involving a range of ecosystem services (e.g., water 
quality, biodiversity), primitive recreation, cultural sites, and other unique characteristics, many 
of which incorporate concepts of non-market or non-use values. The categories of benefits 
associated with local concerns and roadless characteristics clearly overlap in a number of cases 
(e.g., water quality protection), however, to facilitate discussion about the capability of the 
proposed rule to achieve a balance between local management challenges or concerns and 
roadless characteristics, benefits are grouped and presented according to these two areas. 
 
 
Analysis of Local Resource Concerns 
 
Timber (Wood Products) Supply 
 
The National Forests in Colorado sold approximately 200 million board feet (MMBF) annually 
from the 1950s through the 1980s. The level decreased to approximately 50 MMBF annually 
between 1995 and 2005. Timber sales then increased to approximately 100 MMBF annually 
since 2006 in response to the current mountain pine beetle epidemic. 
 
Within the analysis area there are approximately 2,700,000 acres available for timber 
management to achieve multiple use objectives and provide a sustainable supply of timber. Most 
of the area available for tree-cutting in the roadless areas is not associated with timber 
production.  Tree-cutting and harvest are primarily permitted to achieve multiple resource 
management objectives, including improving forest health and reducing hazardous fuels where 
timber volume is sometimes a secondary objective or a by-product. Roads are used where timber 
is removed and to increase economic feasibility. Removal of trees to reduce hazardous fuels or 
 71 
 
reduce the spread of forest diseases or insects is often economically feasible only if a road 
system is present. 
 
Reducing hazardous fuels has been an important objective in forest vegetation management in 
recent years. The emphasis on hazardous fuel reduction has focused on commercial and non-
commercial thinning in the pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir cover types. 
Lodgepole pine and aspen are early successional species. These species are typically regenerated 
using even-aged methods; thinning is not generally an option as they are susceptible to wind 
throw. Forest vegetation management in spruce-fir forests primarily relies on uneven-aged 
methods with limited thinning. 
 
When considering the assumption that agency or program budgets will remain relatively flat, 
average total volume sold from NFS land may experience little change across all alternatives. 
Overall, the volume differences across alternatives are not anticipated to result in significant 
impacts to the wood products and forest service sectors9. 
 
Minerals and Energy 
 
Mineral and energy resources from IRAs can be of substantial value, and road access for 
exploration and development can have affect future development of these resources. On a 
national scale, mineral and energy contributions from IRAs are small, but, these contributions 
can have important economic impacts on local communities.  
 
A wide variety of mineral and energy resources occur in CRAs. Mineral resources may be 
classified into three categories: locatable minerals, leasable minerals, and saleable minerals. 
Locatable minerals include commodities like gold, silver, molybdenum, copper, lead, zinc, 
cobalt, uranium, dimension stone, and certain varieties of limestone. Leasable minerals in 
Colorado include energy mineral resources such as oil, gas, coal and geothermal. Saleable 
minerals are common varieties of sand, stone, gravel, soil, and clay. Generally, they are 
widespread and of low value, primarily used for construction or landscaping materials. Their 
value is dependent upon market factors, quality of the material, and availability of transportation. 
 
The lessees have exclusive rights to development of the Federal mineral estate covered by their 
lease, subject to standard lease terms, lease stipulations, and applicable regulations at the time of 
lease issuance. Under the referenced statutes, the Forest Service provides BLM with stipulations 
(operating constraints) to be included as needed for surface resource protection in leases on NFS 
lands. The Forest Service determines whether lease stipulations are needed during the 
environmental analysis that is completed for leasing. 
 
This section addresses oil and gas, as well as coal and geothermal development; the effects of the 
proposed action on other minerals and energy sectors are expected to be minimal (see section 
“Other Resources, Services, and Programs”). For details as well as references and citations about

counties (USDA Forest Service, 2005).

the discussion below, see Leasable Minerals and Social and Economic sections in chapter 3 of 
the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Analysis of Alternatives: Oil and Gas 
 
Development of natural gas and oil resources generally consists of road and well pad  
construction, drilling of wells, and installation of infrastructure necessary for production.  Roads 
are considered necessary for exploration and development of oil and gas.  Clearing of vegetation 
and construction of well pads and right-of-ways for roads and pipelines are also necessary for 
development of oil and gas resources. Development activity (initial road and pad construction 
and drilling of wells) usually occurs intensively over a few months, or sometimes a few years in 
the case of large fields.  Once production has been established, subsequent activity generally 
consists of well and road maintenance and inspections by operators and agency personnel.  These 
activities usually occur on a regular, though not intensive (e.g., once weekly), basis as long as 
wells are in production.  Producing wells and associated facilities and roads are likely to exist on 
the landscape for more than 15 years.   Exploration wells that are dry holes (incapable of 
producing in paying quantities) are plugged and abandoned , and the well pad and access road 
are reclaimed, unless needed for other purposes. 
 
Areas with high potential for oil and gas development to occur are in nationally significant 
natural gas-producing basins:  the Piceance Basin (portions of the GMUG and White River 
National Forests) and the San Juan Basin (a portion of the San Juan National Forest). Natural gas 
resource development in these basins and roadless areas are active and there are leases currently 
being developed.  Natural gas production from these lands contributes to supply necessary to 
meet demand locally, regionally, and nationally. The remainder of the analysis area is considered 
to have moderate to no potential for oil and gas occurrence, and low to no potential for 
development in the next 15 years. 
 
Estimated projections of oil and gas wells, roads, and production carry a very high level of 
uncertainty about whether or not wells might be drilled and where they might be drilled.  
Projections do not represent any kind of binding limit on the number of future wells, but 
generally represent a maximum development scenario. Projections of oil and gas road miles, 
wells, and production that could occur in IRAs and CRAs in the next 15 years were estimated 
based on existing information, in particular, BLM Reasonably foreseeable development 
scenarios (see Minerals section within Chapter 3 of the RDEIS). 
 
Differences in oil production across the alternatives are relatively inconsequential. Projected oil 
production ranges from approximately 50,000 barrels under Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 compared to 
approximately 110,000 barrels under Alternative 3 over a period of 15 to 30 years (see Tables 
16, 17, and 18). 
 
The extent to which oil and gas production can occur in roadless areas varies by alternative as 
noted below. See “Distributional Effects: Economic Impacts” for additional discussion of oil and 
gas production and output across alternatives. 
 
 Alternative 1 (2001 Rule) 
 73 
 
 
Under Alternative 1, road construction and reconstruction for oil and gas development would be 
allowed in IRAs only in conjunction with oil and gas leases that are issued before the effective 
date of the Colorado Roadless Rule and whose terms allow surface occupancy.  Oil and gas 
leasing after the effective date of the Colorado Roadless Rule would be allowed per forest plans 
and leasing availability decisions, but road construction and reconstruction in conjunction with 
those leases would be prohibited. The newly identified roadless acres that are not within the 
IRAs under alternative 1, but included within CRAs under Alternative 2 and make up the 
remainder of the analysis area, follow forest plan and oil and gas leasing availability direction. 
 
There are nineteen IRAs with more than 640 acres under lease (see Table 12).  These 19 IRAs 
had approximately 154,200 acres leased as of September 2009.  Roads would be allowed in 
conjunction with leases covering approximately 132,000 acres (85% of the leased area) and 
roads would be prohibited in conjunction with leases covering approximately 22,600 acres (15% 
of the leased area).    
 
For effects analysis purposes, fourteen IRAs within the GMUG, White River, and San Juan NTs 
are considered to have high potential for oil and gas roads and development activity over the 15-
year analysis timeframe and therefore be likely to have oil and gas development and associated 
road construction in conjunction with leases issued as of the effective date of the Colorado 
Roadless Rule. 
 
Table 12.  Acres leased in IRAs as of September 20091 (IRAs in boldface are those considered 
most likely to have oil and gas development activity and associated roads in conjunction with 
leases issued as of the effective date of the Colorado Roadless Rule.).  
 
 74 
 
 
Acres rounded to nearest 100.  Totals may not add due to rounding. 
1  IRAs with fewer than 640 acres under lease are not listed, as they are considered to have such a 
small percentage of the roadless area leased that there would be essentially no potential for 
development and associated roads in the IRA. Leased acres with terms allowing surface occupancy 
and road construction or reconstruction are distinguished from leased acres with terms prohibiting 
surface occupancy, including road construction or reconstruction.    
2  IRAs with low development potential due to No Surface Occupancy stipulations on leases. 
3  IRAs with low development potential due to less favorable positions in oil and gas basins, relatively 
small lease areas, distance from proven production, and/or unsuccessful attempts at establishing 
production in or near the IRAs. 
 
Table 13 summarizes projections of oil and gas road miles, road acres, wells, well pads, pad 
acres, and production under Alternative 1 within IRA boundaries as well as for the analysis area 
as a whole which is the sum of land within IRAs and within new CRAs10 (see Minerals section 
within Chapter 3 of the RDEIS for details about activity projections). 
                                                 
10 Differences in projected production as well as activity levels within roadless area boundaries under the 2001 Rule 
compared to the proposed action, as originally reported in the RDEIS, were due to the differences in areas enclosed 
by IRA and CRA boundaries. When a consistent set of boundaries are used to represent an analysis area of 
equivalent size for all alternatives (i.e., IRAs plus new CRA roadless areas not included within IRA boundaries) for 
the GMUG, White River, and San Juan NFs, then production and development activity will be essentially the same 
for Alternatives 1 and 2. This result is supported by the fact that restrictions on road construction for oil and gas 
operations are the same for Alternatives 1 and 2 for their respective roadless areas. Given that IRAs exceed CRAs 
for the GMUG, CRAs exceed IRAs for the San Juan, and IRAs are approximately equal to CRAs for the White 
River NF, production and activity levels for the “analysis area” are approximated by taking the sum of production 
and activity levels for the GMUG and White River within IRAs for Alternative 1 and for the San Juan within CRAs 
for Alternative 2.

Table 13 - Estimated 15-year projections of oil and gas production and development 
activities for the Analysis Area and within IRAs under Alternative 1.   
 
1   GMUG:  13 wells on single-well pads of 1 acre each, 30 wells on 6 well pads of 3.5 acres each, average estimated ultimate per-
well recovery of 0.8 BCFG and 3,500 BO from Mesaverde sandstones and 5 BCFG from Mesaverde coals. 
2 San Juan:  Some wells are on multi-well pads.  Well and pad numbers and average estimated ultimate per-well recovery of 3.6 
bcfg verified by Walt Brown, San Juan National Forest, May 14, 2008. 
3 White River:  All wells on 7-well pads of 6 acres each, average estimated per-well recovery of 1.15 BCFG. 
4 Road disturbance in acres is based on an estimated average disturbance of 4 acres/mile of road.  Actual road miles and acres for 
an individual well may vary considerably from the average, depending on terrain and actual distance of the well from an existing 
road. Road miles include assumed co-located pipelines. 
5 Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) is the estimated amount of oil or natural gas the projected wells could produce during average 
well life, which for the purpose of this reported is considered to be 30 years. 
6 The analysis area includes (1) land common to IRAs and CRAs, (2) substantially altered land within IRAs only, and (3) new 
roadless areas within CRAs only. 
Source:  As cited in Chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010),  projections are based on BLM RFDs, existing 
development decisions, existing lease terms allowing surface occupancy, and prohibitions on road construction and 
reconstruction in conjunction with future leases.  Projections are considered maximums; actual activity levels could be less than 
shown. 
 
The 308 IRAs that do not have existing leases are assumed to have low to no potential for 
development.  The quantified extent of potential oil and gas production from these IRAs has not 
been estimated for this analysis.  Potential production from these IRAs is assumed to be 
considerably less than that projected for the IRAs identified as having high potential for oil and 
gas occurrence and development. 
 
The estimated effects over a 15 year timeframe include the following: 
 There are a total of approximately 130 miles of roads and 1,074 acres of disturbance 
projected in IRAs. This level of disturbance constitutes about 1% of the acres in the 14 
IRAs projected to have oil and gas roads and development, or about 0.03% of total IRA 
acres in Colorado. There are approximately 14 miles of additional roads and 200 
additional acres of disturbance within the analysis area that are outside of IRAs

boundaries but within land that would be considered roadless (i.e., new CRAs) under 
Alternative 2. 
o If a consistent set of boundaries are used to represent the same analysis area for 
all alternatives (i.e., IRAs plus new CRA roadless areas not included within IRA 
boundaries), then production and development activity are approximated to be 
essentially the same for Alternatives 1 and 2. This result is supported by the fact 
that restrictions on road construction for oil and gas operations are the same for 
Alternatives 1 and 2 for their respective roadless areas. 
 Access to an estimated 1046 bcfg of gas from the analysis area, including 949 bcfg from 
within IRAs and an additional 97 bcfg from lands outside of IRAs but within new CRAs.  
 Though unlikely, there could be some non-quantified low level of activity, including 
roads, in conjunction with existing leases in IRAs with low development potential. 
 Opportunities for exploration and development of oil and gas resources in all IRAs with 
potential for resource occurrence and not under lease prior to the effective date of the 
Colorado Roadless Rule would be foregone for the 15-year analysis timeframe. 
  
 
Alternative 2 (Colorado Roadless Rule, Proposed Action) 
 
Under Alternative 2, road construction and reconstruction for oil and gas development would be 
allowed in CRAs only in conjunction with oil and gas leases that are issued before the effective 
date of the Colorado Roadless Rule and whose terms allow surface occupancy and roads, similar 
to Alternative 1 with the exception that roadless boundaries differ.  Future oil and gas leasing 
would be allowed per forest plans and leasing availability decisions, but road construction and 
reconstruction in conjunction with those leases would be prohibited. The substantially altered 
acres that are within the analysis area but not within the CRAs under alternative 2 follow forest 
plan and oil and gas leasing availability direction. 
 
There are twenty CRAs with more than 640 acres under lease on the GMUG, White River, and 
San Juan National Forests.  These 20 CRAs had approximately 159,300 acres leased as of 
September 2009.  Roads would be allowed in conjunction with leases covering approximately 
136,700 acres (86% of the leased area), and roads would be prohibited in conjunction with leases 
covering 22,700 acres (14% of the leased area). For effects analysis purposes, fifteen CRAs on 
the GMUG, White River, and San Juan NFs (Table 14, CRAs in boldface) are considered to have 
high potential for oil and gas roads and development activity in the next 15 years and therefore 
projected to be likely to have oil and gas development as of the effective date of the Colorado 
Roadless Rule. 
 
 
 
Table 14 - Acres leased in CRAs as of September 20091  (CRAs in boldface are those 
considered most likely to have oil and gas development activity and associated roads in 
conjunction with leases issued as of the effective date of the Colorado Roadless Rule)

Acres rounded to nearest 100.  Totals may not add due to rounding. 
1  CRAs with fewer than 640 acres under lease (including the S. San Juan CRA on the SJ NF) are not 
listed, as they are considered to have such a small percentage of the roadless area leased that there 
would be essentially no potential for development and associated roads in the IRA. Leased acres 
with terms allowing surface occupancy and road construction or reconstruction are distinguished 
from leased acres with terms prohibiting surface occupancy, including road construction or 
reconstruction.    
2  CRAs with low development potential due to No Surface Occupancy stipulations on leases. 
3  CRAs with low development potential due to less favorable positions in oil and gas basins, relatively 
small lease areas, distance from proven production, and/or unsuccessful attempts at establishing 
production in or near the CRAs. 
 
Table 15 summarizes projections of oil and gas production and development activity under 
Alternative 2 within CRA boundaries as well as for the analysis area as a whole which is the sum 
of land within CRAs and substantially altered lands previously included within IRAs but 
excluded from CRAs.

an individual well may vary considerably from the average, depending on terrain and actual distance of the well from an existing

6 The analysis area includes (1) land common to IRAs and CRAs, (2) substantially altered land within IRAs only, and (3) new 
roadless areas within CRAs only. 
Source:  As cited in Chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010), projections are based on BLM RFDs, existing 
development decisions, existing lease terms allowing surface occupancy, and prohibitions on road construction and 
reconstruction in conjunction with future leases.  Projections are considered maximums; actual activity levels could be less than 
shown. 
 
Under Alternative 2, 343 CRAs that do not have existing leases are assumed to have low to 
moderate potential for oil and gas occurrence and low to no potential for development.  The 
quantified extent of potential oil and gas production from these CRAs has not been estimated for 
this analysis.  Potential production from these CRAs is assumed to be considerably less than that 
projected for the CRAs identified as having high potential for oil and gas occurrence and 
development. 
 
The estimated effects of Alternative 2 over a 15-year time period include the following: 
 There are a total of approximately 139 miles of road and 1,134 acres of disturbance 
projected in CRAs. This level of disturbance constitutes about 1% of the acres in the 
fifteen CRAs projected to have oil and gas roads and development, or about 0.03% of the 
total proposed CRA acres in Colorado. There are approximately 5 miles of additional 
roads and 141 additional acres of disturbance within the analysis area that are outside of 
CRA boundaries but within substantially altered IRA lands that would be considered 
roadless under Alternative 1.

o As noted for Alternative 1, if a consistent set of boundaries are used to represent 
the same analysis area, then production and development activity are 
approximated to be essentially the same for Alternatives 1 and 2. This result is 
supported by the fact that restrictions on road construction for oil and gas 
operations are the same for Alternatives 1 and 2 for their respective roadless 
areas. 
 Access to an estimated 1046 bcfg of gas from the analysis area, including 1028 bcfg from 
within CRAs and an additional 18 bcfg from lands outside of CRAs but within 
substantially altered IRAs. 
 Though unlikely, there could be some non-quantified low level of activity, including 
roads, in conjunction with existing leases in CRAs with low development potential. 
 Opportunities for exploration and development of oil and gas resources in all CRAs with 
potential for resource occurrence and not under lease prior to the effective date of the 
Colorado Roadless Rule would be foregone over the 15-year analysis timeframe. 
 
Alternative 3 (Forest Plan Direction, No Action) 
 
Under Alternative 3, road construction and reconstruction for oil and gas development would be 
allowed in IRAs in conjunction with existing and future oil and gas leases whose terms allow 
surface occupancy and roads as well as the analysis acres that are not within the IRAs.  Future oil 
and gas leases could be offered, sold, and issued under the direction of forest plans and oil and 
gas leasing availability decisions.   Road construction and reconstruction would be prohibited in 
conjunction with existing and future leases where lease stipulations prohibit surface occupancy 
or roads.  Waivers, exceptions, or modifications to stipulations prohibiting surface occupancy on 
existing leases would be considered (not necessarily granted) at the time operations are proposed, 
if such are requested, in contrast to Alternatives 1 and 2 where no waivers are allowed. 
 
Oil and gas leasing with subsequent development could also occur in currently unleased IRAs 
where lands are available for leasing under forest plans and leasing availability decisions.  
Development could occur on future leases where lease terms allow surface occupancy and roads. 
 
Though IRAs or CRAs are not retained under Alternative 3, effects results for lands within IRA 
boundaries are discussed to provide comparison with other alternatives. There are 19 IRAs with 
more than 640 acres are under lease.  These 19 IRAs had approximately 268,500 acres leased or 
available for leasing as of September 2009.  Roads would be allowed in conjunction with 
existing and future leases covering approximately 173,100 acres (64% of the leased and available 
acres), and roads would be prohibited in conjunction with existing and future leases covering 
approximately 95,400 acres (36% of the leased and available acres). For effects analysis 
purposes, fourteen IRAs (see Table 16) are considered to have high potential for oil and gas 
roads and development activity associated with existing and future leases over the 15-year 
analysis timeframe and therefore likely to have oil and gas development in conjunction with 
existing leases and future leases issued under direction of forest plans and leasing availability 
decisions.

leasing availability decisions as of September 2009 under Alternative 3 (7).  (IRA lands in

boldface are those considered most likely to have oil and gas development activity and 
associated roads in conjunction with existing leases and future leases issued under direction of 
forest plans and leasing availability decisions) 
 
Acres rounded to nearest 100.  Totals may not add due to rounding. 
1  IRAs with fewer than 640 acres under lease are not included, as they are considered to have such a small percentage of 
the roadless area leased that there would be essentially no potential for development and associated roads in the IRA.    
2  IRAs have low development potential due to No Surface Occupancy stipulations on leases. 
3  51,658 acres of Priest Mountain Roadless Area is designated not available for leasing. 
4 3,091 acres of Raggeds Roadless Area is designated not available for leasing. 
5  IRAs have low development potential due to less favorable positions in oil and gas basins, relatively small lease areas, 
distance from proven production, and/or unsuccessful attempts at establishing production in or near the IRAs. 
6  San Juan National Forest currently is conducting analysis for oil and gas leasing availability, so for purposes of this 
report, no lands are shown as being available for leasing.  Once the leasing decision is issued, there may be additional 
lands designated as available for lease in the HD Mountains and South San Juan IRAs. 
7 Leased acres and acres available but not leased are distinguished as follows:  Acres with terms allowing surface 
occupancy, including road construction or reconstruction in conjunction with a lease, and acres with terms prohibiting 
surface occupancy, including road construction or reconstruction in conjunction with a lease.  
 
There are 115 IRAs that are available for leasing, but have no existing leases or less than 640 
acres leased in an individual IRA.  These areas are considered to have some level of potential for 
oil and gas occurrence, but low to no development potential.  No oil and gas development 
activity or road construction or reconstruction is projected in these IRAs.  However, because 
projections are uncertain estimates, it is possible that there could be some level of oil and gas

Table 17 summarizes projections of production and development activity under Alternative 3 for 
lands that would have been included within IRA boundaries under Alternative 1, as well as for 
the analysis area as a whole which is the sum of land within IRAs and within new CRAs.

1   GMUG:  15 wells on single-well pads of 1 acre each, 35 wells on 7 well pads of 3.5 acres each, average estimated ultimate per-
well recovery of 0.8 BCFG and 3,500 BO from Mesaverde sandstones and 5 BCFG from Mesaverde coals. 
2 San Juan:  Some wells are on multi-well pads.  Well and pad numbers and average estimated ultimate per-well recovery of 3.6

3 White River:  All wells on 7-well pads of 6 acres each, average estimated per-well recovery of 1.15 BCFG. 
4 Road disturbance in acres is based on an estimated average disturbance of 4 acres/mile of road.  Actual road miles and acres for 
an individual well may vary considerably from the average, depending on terrain and actual distance of the well from an existing

5 Estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) is the estimated amount of oil or natural gas the projected wells could produce during average 
well life, which for the purpose of this reported is considered to be 30 years.

IRAs that are available for leasing but do not have existing leases are assumed to have low to 
moderate potential for occurrence of oil and gas and low to no potential for development.  The 
quantified extent of potential oil and gas production from these IRAs has not been estimated for 
this analysis.  Potential production from these IRAs is assumed to be considerably less than that

have low to no potential for development. 
 
The estimated effects of Alternative 3 over a 15-year time period include the following: 
 There are approximately 146 miles of road and 1,210 acres of disturbance projected in 
IRAs. This level of disturbance constitutes about 1% of the acres in the 14 IRAs 
projected to have oil and gas roads and development, or about 0.03% of total IRA acres 
in Colorado. There are approximately 19 miles of additional roads and 108 additional 
acres of disturbance with the analysis area that are outside of IRA boundaries but within 
new CRA boundaries that would be considered roadless under Alternative 2. 
o In contrast to Alternatives 1 and 2 where production and development activity is 
approximately equal for the analysis area, production and activity are projected to 
be somewhat greater under Alternative 3 due to the availability of additional acres 
not yet leased in IRAs with high potential for development (compare Tables 15 
and 17.5). 
 Access to an estimated 1154 bcfg of gas from the analysis area, including 1053 bcfg from 
within IRAs and an additional 101 bcfg from lands outside of IRAs but within new 
CRAs. 
 Though unlikely, there could be some non-quantified low level of activity, including 
roads, in conjunction with existing leases in IRAs with low development potential. 
 Opportunities for exploration and development of oil and gas resources in IRAs would be 
limited only by direction in forest plans and oil and gas leasing availability decisions.  
Forest plan direction and leasing availability decisions prohibit roads for oil and gas 
operations in a limited number of IRAs in areas with potential for oil and gas resource 
occurrence. 
 
Alternative 4 (Colorado Roadless Rule with Proposed Public Upper Tier) 
 
The effect under alternative 4 would be the same as alternative 2, with the exception that of the 
upper tier discussion.  The upper tier acres proposed by members of the public contain existing 
leases. While the upper tier acres for alternative 4 have a road construction/reconstruction 
prohibition, road construction/reconstruction would be allowed pursuant to reserved or 
outstanding rights as provided for by statute or treaty, which would include a valid existing 
mineral leases.  Upper tier designation would have no effect on road construction or 
reconstruction prohibitions as roads would be authorized under existing leases.  Any lands lease 
in a CRA (alternative 4 proposed upper tier), after the effective date of the Colorado Roadless 
Rule, would prohibit road construction or reconstruction but would otherwise be available for 
development as described in future programmatic leasing analyses or a site-specific analysis 
prepared pursuant to NEPA. 
 
Analysis of Alternatives: Coal 
 
This section presents information and effects on accessibility to coal resources on National 
Forest System (NFS) lands subject to roadless rulemaking in Colorado.  This analysis presents 
estimated projections of activities that might occur in the areas that would be managed as 
 83 
 
roadless under each alternative, as well as the activities that would occur outside of the 
alternative’s roadless areas that are within the analysis area.  The analysis presents only effects 
on accessibility to coal resources for national forest units on which coal resource development is 
likely to occur in the analysis timeframe of 15 years.  The only unit for which coal resource 
development is anticipated is the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre, and Gunnison National Forests 
(GMUG NF). For details about the information presented below, as well as citations/references, 
please see the “Coal” section in Chapter 3 of the revised DEIS (RDEIS) (USDA Forest Service, 
2010). For a discussion of effects related to projected length of time for mining operations (and 
roads), as well as employment, income, and mineral payments/royalties paid to federal, state, and 
local governments, see the “Distributional Effects” section in this document. 
 
Five national forest units in Colorado acknowledge that coal resources may exist within their 
boundaries; the Pike - San Isabel NF, the Routt NF, the San Juan NF, the White River NF and 
the GMUG NF. The Forest Service does not currently have sufficient site-specific information to 
estimate the amount of coal resources that may occur in IRAs or CRAs on the Pike-San Isabel, 
Routt or White River National Forests.  On the San Juan National Forest, an estimated 1.5 billion 
tons of coal reserves may exist in the Durango Known Recoverable Coal Resource Area 
(overlaps with Pagosa Springs coalfield) in IRAs, CRAs, and non-roadless lands according to the 
San Juan Forest Plan.  On the GMUG NF, there is currently insufficient site-specific information 
to estimate the amount of coal resources in the Carbondale, Crested Butte and Tongue Mesa 
coalfields.  The GMUG NF estimates that about 1.6 billion tons of in-place coal reserves occur in 
IRAs, CRAs and non-roadless areas in the Somerset and Grand Mesa coalfields.  About 1.2 
billion tons these reserves are estimated to occur in IRAs and CRAs. 
 
As of November 2009, there were about 14,000 acres of land under lease for coal development 
on IRAs, CRAs and non-roadless lands in the Somerset Coalfield on the GMUG NF, of which 
about 7,100 acres are in IRA and/or CRAs.  There were no approved coal exploration licenses in 
roadless areas in November 2009.  There were no leases or exploration licenses in place on the 
Pike-San Isabel, Routt, San Juan, or White River National Forests. 
 
Three underground mines (West Elk, Bowie #2, and Elk Creek) produce coal from private lands 
and leases on federal lands.  Collectively, the three existing mines currently produce about 15 
million tons per year, which accounts for about 40% of the coal production in Colorado.  
 
Approximately 75 miles of roads have been constructed or reconstructed since the 1960s in IRAs 
and CRAs on the GMUG NF for the purposes of coal exploration, methane drainage and 
monitoring activities. Approximately 65 of those miles have been decommissioned and 
reclaimed. Currently about 15 miles of roads are in place for coal-mining purposes. Based on 
experience in the West Elk IRA, the decommissioning and subsequent reclamation is well 
established two to three years after reclamation. 
 
No active coal-related activity is presently occurring or foreseen on the Pike-San Isabel, Routt, 
San Juan, or White River National Forests in the 15-year analysis timeframe.  However, coal 
exploration and development is expected to continue on the GMUG NF in the Somerset 
Coalfield, and some activity in the Grand Mesa coalfield is expected in the analysis timeframe. 
The GMUG roadless area of analysis is 39,600 acres which includes the 7,100 leased acres. 
 84 
 
 
This analysis assumes that roads will be necessary pursuant to issuance of coal exploration 
licenses, and to exercise the rights granted by a coal lease (whether existing or future). Certain 
coal-related surface facilities and associated roads may exist on the landscape for many years 
(20- 30) in the case of ventilation shafts and monitoring or other facilities, or be of shorter term 
(less than 2, or 3 to 5 years) in the case of exploration holes or methane drainage (vent) wells, 
and other short term uses. Because initial road construction normally occurs over a concentrated 
period and subsequent use can occur over a range of subsequent years (from less than one year to 
10 or more), projections for roads are presented over a 15-year period. For all alternatives, 
roading and mining activities would be done in a way that minimizes adverse effects by 
complying with lease stipulations, forest plan direction, regulations, and laws.  
 
 Alternative 1 (2001 Rule) 
 
Alternative 1, road construction or reconstruction in IRAs would be limited to areas under lease 
prior to the effective date of the Colorado Rule.  About 5,900 acres of the 14,000 acres currently 
under lease are in IRAs, and substantially altered acres of IRA. There are also about 1,200 acres 
of lands currently leased, and an additional 1,500 acres of currently unleased lands in CRA that 
are not within IRA that would be accessible under this alternative. 
   
Effects of Alternative 1 on coal leasing and development include the following estimated 
projections of activities on the GMUG NF over the 15-year analysis period: 
 About 16 miles of temporary road construction is projected.  About 7 miles of this 
temporary road construction is on the 5,900 acres of existing leases in IRAs.   
o Any road construction would be done in a manner that minimizes effects to 
resources, prevents unnecessary disturbance, and complies with lease stipulations, 
Forest Plan direction, regulations, and laws.  Roads would be decommissioned by 
obliteration when no longer needed for the purposes of the lease.  Most roads 
would be in place for approximately three to five years, and would then be 
decommissioned.   
 Decommissioning and obliteration of at least 6 miles of road constructed in the 15 year 
analysis timeframe. Other roads would likely be constructed and decommissioned 
consistent with coal lease, license, or permit terms in this same timeframe. 
 Access to approximately 157 million tons of coal reserves including (1) 108 million tons 
of in IRAs that are currently under lease, and (2) about 49 million tons on 2,700 acres of 
coal resources within CRAs that are not within IRAs.  
 
Effects of road prohibitions on development of coal resources under Alternative 1 include the 
following:  
 Lost opportunities for exploration and development of unknown quantities of federal coal 
resources and potential bypassing of economic federal coal resources in areas within 
IRAs not leased by the effective date of the Colorado Rule.  These areas include all 
identified coalfields/regions on the GMUG NF (not leased), and the Pike-San Isabel, 
Routt, San Juan, and White River National Forests. 
 Lost opportunity for exploration of un-leased federal coal resources on about 31,000 
acres of the GMUG NF in IRAs that overlap with the Somerset and Grand Mesa 
 85 
 
coalfields. Recoverable coal reserves rendered inaccessible are estimated to be 568 
million tons. 
 Limits on the overall longevity of the existing mines operating on the GMUG NF, and 
bypassing of federal coal resources due to prohibitions on road construction that may be 
needed to support mining.  Estimated effects on longevity of existing mining operations 
are discussed in the “Distributional Impacts” section.  
 Limits on placing facilities to manage coal mine methane. Methane capture opportunities 
would use existing coal mine roads, or new roads built on coal leases in place prior to the 
date of the Rule, or on an oil and gas lease effective prior to the date of the Rule if 
methane is captured pursuant to a gas lease.  Use of existing coal roads for methane 
capture could result in the roads remaining on the landscape for a longer period of time. 
 
Alternative 2 (Colorado Roadless Rule, Proposed Action) 
 
Under Alternative 2, road construction or reconstruction in proposed CRAs could be approved 
pursuant to existing and future coal leases, and on future coal exploration licenses, in the North 
Fork coal mining area on the GMUG NF. About 4,000 acres of the CRA lands in the North Fork 
Coal Mining area are currently under lease, as well as about 15,600 acres of currently unleased 
lands in CRAs for a combined access to about 20,000 acres. On lands within the CRAs that are 
not currently under lease, only coal in the North Fork Coal mining area in the Somerset coalfield 
would be accessible. Coal resources outside CRAs, including those in substantially altered acres 
would remain accessible according to Forest Plan direction. 
  
Effects of Alternative 2 on coal leasing and development, include the following projected 
activities in the North Fork coal mining area over the 15-year analysis period: 
 Access to approximately 514 million tons of coal reserves including (1) 130 million tons 
on existing leases on about 4,000 acres of CRAs, and 3,100 acres in IRA not in CRA,  (2) 
285 million tons on about 15,600 acres of unleased lands within CRAs, and (3) 97 
million tons on about 5,305 acres of unleased land in the substantially altered acres 
outside the CRA.     
 A total of about 52 miles of roads constructed, including 50 miles of coal-related 
temporary or long-term temporary road construction and reconstruction within CRAs and 
2 miles of coal-related temporary or administrative road construction and reconstruction 
on IRA acres that are not part of a CRA.  This road construction primarily would be for 
coal exploration and/or methane drainage purposes.  Roads would be constructed in a 
manner that minimizes adverse effects consistent with Forest Plan direction, regulation 
and laws.  These roads would be closed to the public. When no longer needed, roads 
would be decommissioned by obliteration, and reclaimed and restored to natural 
conditions as specified in the applicable lease, license, or permit.  Coal mine permit 
conditions would call for reclaiming disturbed lands to support the post-mining land use, 
which would be based on Forest Plan direction. 
 At least 6 miles of road are expected to be decommissioned in the 15 year analysis 
timeframe.  
 Within CRAs, coal mine methane capture operations would be restricted to using existing 
coal mine roads, and would be prohibited from constructing new roads solely for methane 
capture operations, unless roads were constructed pursuant to an oil and gas lease issued 
 86 
 
prior to the effective date of the Colorado rule.  Coal mine roads used to access sites of 
wells used for methane capture may be in use longer than if methane were vented to the 
atmosphere. 
Effects of road prohibitions on development of coal resources under Alternative 2 include the 
following:  
 Lost opportunity for exploration of un-leased federal coal resources on about 11,600 
acres of the GMUG NF in IRAs that overlap with the Somerset and Grand Mesa 
coalfields. Recoverable coal reserves rendered inaccessible are estimated to be 212 
million tons. 
 
 Lost opportunities for exploration and development of federal coal resources and 
potential bypassing of economic federal coal resources not within the North Fork coal 
mining area, and not leased as of the effective date of the rule.  These areas include all 
identified coalfields/regions on the GMUG NF (except the North Fork coal mining area), 
and the Pike-San Isabel, Routt, San Juan, and White River National Forests. 
 
Alternative 3 (Forest Plan Direction, No Action) 
 
Under Alternative 3, road construction or reconstruction could be approved on existing and 
future coal leases and coal exploration licenses in IRAs as well as the entire analysis area with 
coal resource potential according to management direction in existing forest plans. 
   
Effects of Alternative 3 on coal leasing and development include the following projected 
activities in IRAs during the 15-year analysis period:  
 Access to portions of 46,000 acres of coal reserves in the Pagosa Springs coalfield 
(estimated at 1.5 billion tons for whole coalfield) that would be included within CRA or 
IRA boundaries under the other alternatives on the San Juan National Forest for coal 
leasing. Management area prescriptions which allow for leasing with protections for 
specific resources, and either, allow road construction, limit or restrict road building in 
some areas, or require no surface occupancy for leases that are in roadless areas. A total 
of approximately 39,600 acres would be accessible for coal-related activities in the 
analysis area; 7,100 acres are under existing leases in CRAs and/or IRAs. 
  
 87 
 
 Ability to consider lands in IRAs for leasing in the Trinidad coalfield on the Pike-San 
Isabel National Forest (accessible under current Forest Plan direction, and road 
construction would be allowed), Carbondale coalfield on the White River National Forest 
(some management area designations allow road construction, others do not; there are 
some management designations that restrict mineral development), and the Green River 
coal region on the Routt National Forest (variety of management area designations some 
of which allow road construction, others do not; there are also some management 
designations that restrict mineral development).     
 Access to approximately 724 million tons of recoverable coal reserves including (1) 130 
million tons on existing leases on CRAs and/or IRAs, and (2) an estimated 595 million 
tons of unleased recoverable coal resources in the analysis area. 
 A total of 73 miles of road constructed including approximately 64 miles of temporary or 
administrative road construction and reconstruction on about 31,000 acres of IRAs in the 
Somerset and Grand Mesa coalfields and 9 miles of temporary or administrative road 
construction or reconstruction on about 2,700 acres that are not in IRA but are in the 
analysis area.  These lands are in a variety of management area prescriptions which allow 
road construction; however, one management area specifically calls for obliterating 
temporary roads in one season after use, another management area calls for minimizing 
mineral disturbance in riparian areas and timely reclamation to restore productivity 
comparable to that before disturbance.  Road construction and decommissioning would 
be subject to the same forest standards and direction as noted for Alternatives 1 and 2. 
 At least 6 miles of coal-related road decommissioning within the 15 year analysis 
timeframe.  
 Access to coal in the Carbondale, Crested Butte and Tongue Mesa coalfields. These lands 
are in a variety of management area prescriptions which allow road construction; 
however, one management area specifically calls for obliterating temporary roads in one 
season after use, and another calls for minimizing mineral disturbance in riparian areas 
and timely reclamation to restore productivity comparable to that before disturbance. 
 
Alternative 4 (Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier) 
 
Since there are no proposed upper tier acres that overlap with current or projected coal leases, the 
effects would be the same as Alternative 2. 
 
 Analysis of Opportunities: Geothermal 
 
Geothermal resources are underground reservoirs of hot water or steam created by heat from the 
earth.  Geothermal steam and hot water can be utilized when they occur naturally on the surface 
of the earth in the form of hot springs, geysers, mud pots, or steam vents. The extent of 
Colorado’s geothermal resource potential has yet to be assessed fully, and there is no definitive 
data indicating where and to what extent geothermal resources might occur in the roadless areas. 
 
As noted in the “Minerals and Energy” section in Chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest 
Service, 2010), there is currently only one geothermal lease application for geothermal resources 
on the GMUG National Forest.  The area of interest is not in an IRA or CRA.  There are no other 
leases, lease applications, operations, or applications for operations on NFS lands in Colorado.  
 88 
 
The BLM-Forest Service programmatic EIS  addressed Forest Service-managed lands that have 
potential for geothermal resources.  The programmatic EIS provides the basis for future 
geothermal leasing availability analyses and decisions on NFS lands in Colorado and other 
states. 
 
Because road construction and reconstruction in IRAs (and CRAs) would be prohibited under 
Alternative 1, as well as Alternatives 2 and 4, with some exceptions that do not include 
geothermal development (see “Proposed Rule and Alternatives”), and roads are assumed to be 
necessary for the development of geothermal resources, these resources would not be developed 
under these Alternatives.  Opportunities for exploration and development of geothermal 
resources in all IRAs and CRAs would be foregone for the 15-year analysis timeframe, 
recognizing that recent interest in geothermal development on National Forest land is limited to 
one lease application (located outside of roadless areas). 
 
Alternative 3 would allow for development of geothermal resources in IRAs and CRAs to the 
extent that forest plans would allow for the necessary development activities (road construction) 
in areas within IRA/CRA boundaries.  Specific geothermal assessment information is insufficient 
to quantify or even qualify the extent and location of possible development. 
 
Compliance with Executive Order 13211 (Statement of Energy Effects) 
 
Based on guidance for implementing Executive Order 13211 (E.O. 13211) of May 18, 2001, 
Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution or Use, 
issued by Office of Management and Budget (Memorandum for Heads of Executive 
Departments and Agencies, and Independent Regulatory Agencies (M-01-27), July 13, 2001), 
this proposed rule constitutes a “significant energy action” as defined in E.O. 13211 because 
projected reductions in coal production under the proposed rule are in excess of 5 million tons 
per year after 2024. 
 
Projections of natural gas production are discussed in the RDEIS and the “Minerals and Energy: 
Analysis of Alternatives – Oil and Gas” and “Distributional Effects: Economic Impacts” sections 
within this report. Based on those projections, it has been determined that natural gas production 
varies across alternatives for only two National Forests (the Grand Mesa, Gunnison, and 
Uncompahgre (GMUG) and White River National Forests). It has also been determined that 
there is no appreciable difference in projected natural gas production between Alternatives 1 
(2001 rule) and 2 (proposed rule) or alternative 4. The difference in potential natural gas 
production between alternatives 1, 2, or 4 (27 billion cubic feet per year) and alternative 3 (no 
action) (31 billion cubic feet per year) is a decrease of only 4 bcf/year, or 4 million mcf/year, 
which is well below the E. O. 13211 criterion for adverse effects of 25 million mcf. 
Projected oil production ranges from approximately 50,000 barrels under Alternatives 1, 2, and 4 
to approximately 110,000 barrels under Alternative 3 over a period of 15 to 30 years. The 
corresponding reduction in oil production per day under alternatives 1 or 2 or alternative 3 (no 
action) is inconsequential compared to the E. O. 13211 criterion of 10,000 barrels per day. 
Based on average annual coal production rates estimated for economic impact analysis purposes, 
annual aggregate production across the three mines operating in the affected area is projected to 
be the same under the proposed rule and the no action alternative (i.e., forest plans alternative) 
 89 
 
for the first 24 years after implementation (2011 to 2034). Coal production and production 
schedules are also projected to be the same for the proposed rule and alternative 4. It is only after 
24 years (2035) that annual coal production is projected to decrease under the proposed rule 
compared to the no action alternative by an amount of 5.6 million tons per year which is the 
average annual production from the Elk Creek mine which ends after 2034. A decrease of 5.6 
million tons is only slightly above the E. O. 13211 criterion of 5 million tons per year for 
significant adverse effects. Production is estimated to decrease by 6.0 million tons per year under 
the proposed rule compared to no action by 2058 when production ceases for all mines under the 
proposed rule. Coal production is projected to continue for an additional 22 years (until 2079) 
under the no action alternative. 
The total reduction in recoverable coal reserves from roadless areas that are made accessible 
under the proposed rule, relative to no action alternative, is estimated to be 210 million tons (i.e., 
724 - 514 = 210 million ton reduction). In comparison, the recoverable coal reserves11 reported 
for the State of Colorado by the US Energy Information Administration ranges from 629 million 
tons in 2002 to 328 million tons by 200712, recognizing that direct comparisons of accessible 
coal reserves under the alternatives with recoverable reserves estimated by USEIA are difficult 
due to differences in estimation procedures. However, the reduction of 210 million tons made 
accessible under the proposed rule is only 2% of the total estimated recoverable reserves13 for the 
state of Colorado in 2007 (9,692 million tons) and less than 0.1% of total estimated recoverable 
reserves for the nation in 2007 (262,689 million tons). 
The estimated reductions in the production life of affected mines under the proposed rule 
compared to the no action alternative may be significant, particularly when considering potential 
increases in demand for coal from western mines14 and the Nation as a whole15. However, both 
the proposed rule and the no action alternatives are projected to sustain similar production rates 
over an extended period of 24 years after implementation of the rule, and there are many other 
factors that are likely to have a more significant effect on energy markets after that time, 
compared to the effect of reduced production under the proposed rule which begins 25 years 
after implementation of this rule would occur (i.e., 2034). It is also noted that approximately 
67% of all coal produced from Colorado in 2008 (32.7 million tons) was exported to other states, 
suggesting that regional markets and prices are likely to be heavily influenced by national prices, 
supplies, and market trends.

14 In 2007, the Energy Information Administration called for a 5% per year increase in coal production from western 
mines, but revised this statement in 2009, suggesting a slower rate of increase. 
15 Demand for coal is anticipated to increase as a consequence of 153 new coal-fired electricity plants to be built by 
2025, many of which will be in states such as FL, TX, IL, KY that import Colorado coal. (“Colorado Mineral and 
Energy Industry Activities, 2006”, Colorado Geological Survey, Department of Natural Resources, Denver CO.)

The reduction in coal production under the proposed rule (as well as alternative 4), relative to the 
no action alternative is not expected to have adverse effects on the productivity, competition, or 
prices in the energy sector regionally (or nationally) due to the following observations: 
- Potential reductions in coal production under the proposed rule, relative to no action are 
not projected to occur until 24 years in the future (2035) and estimated reductions after 
year 24 (i.e., 5.6 million tons/yr) exceed the criterion of 5.0 million tons per year by only 
a small fraction. A second decrease in production of similar magnitude (6.0 million tons 
per year) is projected to occur farther in the future (2059) when all mines cease operation 
under the proposed rule. 
- The reduction in total accessible coal reserves under the proposed rule relative to the no 
action alternative amounts to a relatively small percentage of total estimated recoverable 
reserves in the State of Colorado (2%) and the nation (<0.1%), and 
- The reductions in reserves and production rates under the proposed rule compared to no 
action are estimated to occur well into the future (e.g., 24 and 48 yrs), and the relative 
impact of these reductions is expected to be insignificant compared to the impact of other 
factors that could affect regional and national energy markets by that time. 
 
The reductions in annual production under the 2001 rule, compared to the no action (reductions 
range from 5.6 million tons per year beginning as early as 2013 and increase to 11.6 million tons 
by 2019) are somewhat greater than the reductions noted for the proposed rule (and Alternative 
4), and production life is anticipated to extend for only 7 to 10 years under the 2001 rule 
compared to a longer production life under the no action alternative. 
 
There is a substantial reduction in annual production under the 2001 rule alternative compared to 
the no action alternative (reductions range from 5.6 million tons per year beginning as early as 
2013 and increase to 11.6 million tons by 2019), and production life is anticipated to extend for 
only 7 to 10 years under the 2001 rule compared to a longer production life under the no action 
alternative. The production reductions under the 2001 rule (i.e., 11.6 million tons/yr beginning 
around 2019) exceed the criterion of 5 million tons per year for adverse effects (but reductions 
are still relatively small), and decreases in operating life of the mines as well as total reserves 
may suggest the potential for adverse effects to regional markets. The impacts of a number of 
other factors affecting energy markets and national market trends are still expected to outweigh 
the effects of implementing the 2001 rule alternative. 
 
Alternative 1 has the greatest reduction in production, and alternatives 2 and 4 have some 
reduction compared to forest plans. 
 
No novel legal or policy issues regarding adverse effects to supply, distribution or use of energy 
are anticipated beyond what has already been addressed in the RDEIS, or the Regulatory Impact 
Analysis (RIA). None of the proposed corridors designated for oil, gas, and/or electricity under 
Section 368 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 are within Colorado Roadless Areas. 
 
The proposed rule does not disturb existing access or mineral rights, and restrictions on saleable 
mineral materials are narrow. The proposed rule also provides regulatory mechanism for 
consideration of requests for modification of restrictions if adjustments are determined to be 
 91 
 
necessary in the future. As this action is a significant energy action, the above constitutes the 
Statement of Energy Effects.

Forest Vegetation and Health 
 
Forest health is the perceived condition of forests based on age, structure, composition, function, 
vigor, level of insect and disease, presence and absence of exotic organisms, and resilience to 
disturbance including wildland fire. The following is a summary of information provided in the 
vegetation and forest health section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Roadless areas provide a diverse array of forest vegetation, ranging from warm, dry pinyon-
juniper woodlands to cold, moist sub-alpine forests. Approximately 28 percent of the Colorado 
roadless rule areas consist of non-forest cover types, composed of grasslands and meadows, 
shrublands, areas devoid of vegetation such as exposed bedrock, and a minor amount of surface 
water. The remaining 72 percent is forest, dominated by various species of trees. 
 
Forest health conditions in roadless areas in Colorado are highly variable, with some areas 
considered healthier than others. Lower montane forests, primarily ponderosa pine and Douglas-
fir, are generally considered outside their historic range of variation. These forests are at risk of 
uncharacteristic, high-intensity fire as well as forest health concerns. Fire suppression in the 20th 
century reduced tree mortality and resulted in forests with much higher tree density than existed 
historically. The forest structure in more mesic upper montane ponderosa pine – Douglas-fir 
forests, particularly in the northern Front Range may not have been as severely altered. The 
departure from historic conditions is smaller in the infrequent, high intensity fire regimes of 
spruce-fir and lodgepole pine forests. Although the departure from historic conditions is less than 
in lower elevation forest types, dramatic changes can and have occurred with high-intensity fires 
and beetle epidemics such as the on-going mountain pine epidemic and spruce beetle epidemic. 
Roadless areas by their very nature have limited access and therefore have had little timber 
management. Forest vegetation changes in roadless areas have primarily been influenced by 
natural processes in concert with management such as fire suppression and grazing that affected 
fire frequency in some areas. 
 
Recent outbreaks of insects and disease in Colorado have been larger than most historical 
outbreaks, although a spruce beetle outbreak in the 1940s and 1950s affected hundreds of 
thousands of acres on the White River Plateau In addition, recent outbreaks have been more 
synchronized than in the past, affecting different forest types. Recent outbreaks are attributable 
to stand conditions with high portions of susceptible, mature trees and a warmer climate. Some 
of the forest pests of high concern include the mountain pine beetle (activity was detected on 
over 200,000 acres in roadless areas within the analysis area in 2009; the current epidemic 
threatens to kill most mature lodgepole pine in Colorado and affects ponderosa pine that 
encompasses 183,000 acres as well as other pines), spruce beetle (activity was detected on 
approximately 27,000 acres in 2009), subalpine fir decline (a combination of forest pests have 
affected approximately 53,000 acres of subalpine fir in roadless areas as of 2009), and sudden 
aspen decline (SAD is estimated to occur on over 70,000 acres of aspen in 2009). Other insect 
and disease effects have been documented in relation to douglas fir beetle and white pine blister 
rust.

Forest health prevention and treatment options vary by forest type, pest species and other factors. 
Treatment methods may include, but are not limited to: pesticide spraying, pheromones, 
biological controls, trap trees, thinning, salvage and sanitation harvests, prescribed burning, 
and/or reforestation of non-host tree species. A combination of tree-cutting, removal, and 
prescribed burning are used to reduce the occurrence or spread of damaging insects and diseases, 
address other forest health concerns, and provide desirable forest conditions to reduce fire 
hazard. Management practices vary by management objectives and habitat type. Specific forest 
health treatments involving tree-cutting can include the following: (1) thinning to improve stand 
health (important long-term strategy for mitigating bark beetles and fire); (2) sanitation (very 
effective in small isolated infestations, but may not be effective in outbreak conditions); (3) 
felling and treatment on site (very effective in small isolated infestations, but may not be 
effective in outbreak situations); (4) trap trees (baited with aggregation pheromones to attract 
large numbers of beetles). 
 
Lower elevation mountain forests, primarily composed of ponderosa pine and douglas-fir, are 
generally considered outside their historical range of variation in terms of stand density. These 
forests are at risk of uncharacteristic, high-intensity fire and other forest health concerns. 
Management typically includes thinning of smaller trees and prescribed burning to reduce 
hazardous fuels, improve forest health, and restore ecological processes. Mastication is often 
used as a thinning method where there are no roads or no timber removal objective; roads are 
used when timber is removed and to increase the economic feasibility of treatments. 
 
More moist (mesic) forest ecosystems, primarily lodgepole pine and spruce-fir, generally have 
too much biomass to use mastication to achieve management objectives. The current mountain 
pine beetle epidemic exceeds the Forest Service’s ability to control it. Management in these 
forest types is limited to reducing hazardous fuels and salvaging dead and dying trees to recover 
economic value. The removal of large mature spruce trees within 2 years of being windthrown 
can prevent spruce beetle outbreaks. For details about forest cover, recent trends in forest cover 
and health, treatment methods, and analysis of forest health, see chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA 
Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Analysis of Alternatives 
 
Tree-cutting within roadless areas is anticipated to be relatively modest under any alternative. 
Almost all of the forest vegetation would remain unmanaged over the next 15 years. Unmanaged 
areas, particularly in the ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir cover types, would likely continue to 
depart from historic conditions and would likely experience uncharacteristic fire behavior.  
 
Tree-cutting and road construction restrictions indirectly affect tree mortality associated with 
insect and disease agents and would result in some landscapes being less resilient to large-scale 
insect and disease outbreaks because of high stocking levels. These outbreaks could worsen with 
projected climate change impacts.  Climate change projections do not currently have the 
accuracy at fine resolutions to anticipate site-specific outcomes and responses.  Therefore, 
alternatives that offer the most management flexibility would be more likely to achieve healthy 
forest stands, more resilient to climate change and other stressors.   
 93 
 
 
Assisted migration through reforestation of species or genetics that are better adapted to future 
climates could potentially increase the resiliency of forests to increased temperatures and 
variable precipitation.  Alternatives that would treat more acres would create more opportunities 
to respond proactively to climate change   
 
Larger areas of stands with forest health concerns may conflict with land management objectives 
including a potential increased wildfire hazard and effects on adjacent lands. Standing and down 
dead trees add to the hazardous fuel load, which can result in wildfire impacts on forest and 
adjacent lands. 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
Under this alternative, tree-cutting would be limited to the following: 1) small diameter timber 
needed to restore ecosystem composition and structure or improve threatened, endangered, 
proposed or sensitive species habitat; 2) incidental cutting associated with permitted activities; 3) 
necessary personal or administrative use; or 4) within areas that have already been substantially 
altered that do not require road construction. 
 
There is no associated road construction exception to facilitate the tree-cutting. Costs often 
increase substantially with the distance of a project from a road. Lands within one-quarter to one-
half mile of existing roads would be the most likely to have some trees cut and/or removed 
consistent with the above tree-cutting limitations.  
 
Under this alternative, based on forest projections, 2,300 acres per year are projected to have 
tree-cutting activities for hazardous fuels reduction and other forest management purposes. This 
includes 1,200 acres in IRAs and 1,100 acres in CRAs that are not in IRAs. Tree-cutting on 
approximately 500 of the 2,300 acres is expected to be for protection against insect and disease 
outbreaks. Tree-cutting and road construction have more restrictions on the majority of the IRA 
acres. The restrictions on these activities under this alternative are more restrictive than 
restrictions for any of the other alternatives, except for the upper tier of alternatives 2 and 4. 
There would be some limited opportunities to reduce hazardous fuels near communities but in 
many cases, the forest conditions, technical and economic conditions may not fit the exceptions 
in this alternative. This alternative will not substantially improve forest health and hazardous fuel 
conditions. 
 
Similar forest health concerns exist outside of roadless areas with the potential to spread into 
adjacent roadless areas. Conversely, forest health concerns within roadless areas have potential 
to expand to adjacent areas. From a cumulative perspective, the 2001 rule would have an 
additive impact on reduced opportunities to improve forest health on forest lands as a whole 
when considering that similar activity constraints are in place in other protected areas such as 
wilderness and designated special areas, some of which are adjacent to roadless areas. 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Alternative 2, Proposed Action) 
This alternative provides greater opportunities to improve forest health to meet desired 
vegetation conditions compared to alternatives 1 or 4. This alternative has three exceptions to the 
prohibition on tree-cutting, sale or removal for forest health purposes. These exceptions would 
not be allowed within the 562,300 upper tier acres. 
 94 
 
 
Tree-cutting to reduce the wildfire hazard to an at-risk community is restricted to within the 
CPZ. The CPZ within one-half mile of communities is approximately 285,000 acres; 29,000 are 
upper tier acres.  Where the CPZ meets the requirements and extends an additional mile, there 
are an additional 750,000 CPZ acres; 108,000 of these are upper tier acres.  
 
Tree-cutting to reduce the wildfire hazard to a municipal supply system can extend beyond the 
CPZ if warranted and tree-cutting to prevent or suppress an insect or disease epidemic is not 
limited to a specific area of the CRAs. Neither is allowed within the upper tier acres; 425,000 
upper tier acres are outside of the CPZs.  
 
Temporary roads can be constructed to facilitate the tree-cutting only within the first one-half 
mile of the CPZ which will greatly restrict what tree-cutting will be accomplished for forest 
health purposes.  
 
Approximately 7,000 acres per year (5,800 acres within CRAs and 1,200 acres in the 
substantially altered acres within IRAs but not within CRAs) are projected to be treated by tree-
cutting practices for hazardous fuels reduction and/or forest health purposes. Approximately 
1,000 of the 7,000 acres are expected to focus on protection against insect and disease outbreaks. 
 
Although this alternative is unlikely to substantially improve forest health and hazardous fuel 
conditions overall, the increased flexibility compared to alternatives 1 and 4 would increase the 
likelihood of achieving management objectives in critical areas, especially in the community 
protection zones. Like alternative 1, the feasibility of tree-cutting without temporary road access 
would limit the extent of forest health treatments in large portions of roadless areas. The upper 
tier CRA acres will impact forest health treatments, particularly within the CPZ. 
 
Similar to the 2001 rule, the proposed rule would, to a slightly lesser extent, have an additive 
impact on reduced opportunities to improve forest health on forest lands as a whole when 
considering that similar activity constraints are in place in other protected areas such as 
wilderness and designated special areas, some of which are adjacent to roadless areas. 
Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3, No Action) 
Compared to the other three alternatives, this alternative provides the greatest opportunities to 
achieve resource management objectives that include improving forest health and reducing 
hazardous fuels. While forest plan direction may limit tree-cutting, sale or removal and road 
construction in some of the analysis acres, generally forest management to improve forest health 
would be allowed on most acres. Economics would limit the extent of forest management in 
portions of roadless areas that would continue to be unroaded. 
 
Approximately 16,900 acres per year within the analysis area are projected to be treated with 
tree-cutting practices for hazardous fuels management and/or forest health purposes. An 
estimated 3,700 of the 16,900 acres are expected to be implemented for the purpose of protection 
against insect and disease outbreaks. Although this alternative provides the most flexibility for 
management, accessibility and other resource requirements would result in most of the roadless 
area remaining unmanaged and at high risk of mortality over the next 15 years.  
 
 95 
 
Alternative 3 would not improve forest health or reduce hazardous fuels on most of the area 
within roadless areas but it provides more flexibility than the other three alternatives to address 
concerns that arise and increases the likelihood of achieving management objectives in critical 
areas, especially in the wildland urban interface. 
 
Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier ( Alternative 4, No Action) 
This alternative provides greater opportunities to improve forest health to meet desired 
vegetation conditions compared to alternative 1 but less than alternatives 3 or 2. This alternative 
has the same three exceptions to the prohibition on tree-cutting, sale or removal for forest health 
purposes as alternative 2. Like alternative 2, these exceptions would not be allowed within the 
upper tier acres. The upper tier acres under this alternative are 2,614,200, over 2 million acres 
more than alternative 2. 
 
Tree-cutting to reduce the wildfire hazard to an at-risk community is restricted to within the 
CPZ. The CPZ within one-half mile of communities is approximately 285,000 acres; 43% or 
122,000 are upper tier acres.  Where the CPZ meets the requirements and extends an additional 
mile, there are an additional 750,000 CPZ acres; 415,000 of these are upper tier acres, or 55% of 
the additional CPZ acres. Where the CPZ has the conditions to extend to 1.5 miles, slightly over 
half are upper tier acres where no forest health tree-cutting is allowed. 
 
Tree-cutting to reduce the wildfire hazard to a municipal supply system can extend beyond the 
CPZ if warranted and tree-cutting to prevent or suppress an insect or disease epidemic is not 
limited to a specific area of the CRAs. Neither is allowed within the upper tier acres; over 2 
million upper tier acres are outside of the CPZs.  
 
Temporary roads can be constructed to facilitate the tree-cutting only within the first one-half 
mile of the CPZ which will greatly restrict what tree-cutting will be accomplished for forest 
health purposes.  
 
Approximately 3,000 acres per year (1,800 acres in CRAs and 1,200 acres in the substantially 
altered acres that are within the IRAs but are not within the CRAs) are projected to be treated 
using tree-cutting practices for hazardous fuels reduction and/or other forest health purposes. An 
estimated 800 of the 3,000 acres are expected to be treated for insect and disease purposes.  
 
This alternative is unlikely to substantially improve forest health and hazardous fuel conditions 
overall. There is some increased flexibility compared to alternative 1 to achieve management 
objectives in critical areas, especially in the community protection zones but much less than 
alternative 3 and less than alternative 2 because of the large amount of upper tier acres. Like 
alternatives 1 and 2, the feasibility of tree-cutting without temporary road access would limit the 
extent of forest health treatments in large portions of roadless areas. 
 
Similar to Alternatives 1 and 2, Alternative 4 would have an additive impact on reduced 
opportunities to improve forest health on forest lands as a whole when considering that similar 
activity constraints are in place in other protected areas such as wilderness and designated special 
areas, some of which are adjacent to roadless areas.

Fire Ecology and Fuels 
 
This section addresses potential effects of each alternative on ability to treat hazardous fuels 
primarily within the wildland urban interface (WUI) and municipal watersheds because these are 
the major focus areas of the National Fire Plan, Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA), Healthy 
Forest Initiative and congressional budget direction. The information in this section is primarily a 
summary of material presented in the “Fire and Fuels” section within Chapter 3 of the Revised 
EIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010); refer to that section for additional details. 
 
A WUI refers to those areas where flammable wildland fuels are adjacent to homes and 
communities. The management of roadless areas under each alternative has different exceptions 
for road construction or reconstruction and tree-cutting, sale or removal which can affect the 
amount of hazardous fuels, frequency and intensity of wildfire, and responses to wildfires. This 
section is related to other vegetation and forest health topics which are addressed in the previous 
section of this report. The Fuels and Fire section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010) 
contains details about the material presented below and should be referred to for more 
information and references about fire ecology and fuels. 
 
In April 1999, the General Accounting Office (GAO) published a report titled Western National 
Forests: a Cohesive Strategy is Needed to Address Catastrophic Wildfire Threats (GAO 1999). 
In the report, the GAO asserts, “The most extensive and serious problem related to the health of 
national forests in the interior West is the over-accumulation of vegetation.” In response to this 
study, as well as other studies and multi-agency initiatives, a report titled Managing Impacts of 
Wildfires on Communities and the Environment was published by the US Department of 
Agriculture and US Department of the Interior in 2000, describing a National Fire Plan. The 
National Fire Plan addresses: firefighting resource availability, rehabilitation, hazardous fuels 
reduction, community assistance, and accountability. It established a long-term hazardous fuels 
reduction program to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire to people, communities, and 
natural resources, while restoring forest and rangeland ecosystems to closely match their 
historical structure, function, and dynamics. As a result, hazardous fuel reduction treatments on 
NFS lands became a national priority. Reducing fuel loadings can be accomplished by several 
methods; however, the most common used in Colorado include; thinning, commercial timber 
harvest, stewardship projects, prescribed burning, and other mechanical biomass treatments such 
as hydro-mulching. The Cohesive Strategy identifies priority areas for fuel reduction across the 
interior West. The priority areas include: (1) WUI areas where flammable wildland fuels are 
adjacent to homes and communities; (2) readily accessible municipal watersheds; (3) threatened 
and endangered species habitat; (4) maintenance of existing low risk Condition Class 1 areas. 
 
Fire Conditions and Fuel Treatments 
 
Natural disturbances such as fire, wind, and insects and diseases help shape forests.  Although 
fire is widespread, it is seldom uniform; every forest has its own characteristic pattern of fire 
intensity, frequency, and size. Fire regime and condition class are used to characterize fire.  
 
"Fire regime" refers to the nature of fire occurring over long periods and the prominent 
immediate effects of fire that generally characterize an ecosystem. The analysis area for this rule-
 97 
 
making generally falls into two fire regimes: III (less frequent, mixed severity); and IV (less 
frequent, high severity).  Approximately 60% of the analysis area acreage, within 1½ miles of at-
risk community, are in Fire Regime III and 20% are in Fire Regime IV.  This is important, 
especially in the WUI because these fire regimes (mixed severity and stand replacement, 
respectively) are difficult for firefighters to control leaving communities at-risk vulnerable to the 
negative impacts and potentially adverse consequences of wildland fires. 
 
Fire Regime Condition Class, also referred to as “Condition Class”, describes the degree of 
departure from reference conditions, potentially resulting in changes to key ecosystem 
components such as vegetation characteristics; fuel composition, fire frequency, severity, and 
pattern; and other associated disturbances, such as insect and disease mortality, grazing, and 
drought.  Condition Class 1 refers to ecosystems still within estimated historical ranges of 
variability where there is low risk of losing key ecosystem components in the event of fire. 
Condition Classes 2 and 3 exhibit moderate and high departure and risk of losing key ecosystem 
components respectively. 
 
In CRAs, seven wildland fires over 1,000 acres in size have occurred since 1980. From 1980 - 
2008, over 1,700 ignitions affecting over 45,000 acres occurred in CRAs/IRAs. Approximately 
75% of the fires were caused by lightening and 25% were human-caused. In Colorado and 
throughout much of the Rockies, lodgepole pine forests are experiencing a severe and 
widespread epidemic of mountain pine beetle. In Colorado, tree mortality from the beetle 
currently covers nearly 2.9 million acres, which includes virtually all of the Colorado’s mature 
lodgepole pine in addition to other forest types. Generally speaking, crown and surface-fire risks 
change with time following outbreaks, and factors such as weather and forest composition play 
large roles in determining whether and how intensely a fire will burn. 
 
Fuel treatments are not performed to prevent fires but to alter fuel profiles so that public and 
firefighter safety is improved and communities, watershed, infrastructure, and other values-at-
risk are less vulnerable to impacts from wildfire impacts.  The goals of hazardous fuel treatments 
are to achieve some combination of (a) reducing flammability, (b) reducing fire intensity, (c) 
reducing the potential for creating firebrands (spotting) and crown fires, and (d) increasing 
firefighter safety and effectiveness. For hazardous fuels management to create the desired effect 
on fire behavior, management strategies must address the local and landscape scales. Treatment 
of fuels only within the structure ignition zone (within 200 feet of structures) is not sufficient to 
reduce the threat to neighborhoods and individual structures. 
 
While fuel treatments in themselves will not stop wildland fires, they can change fire behavior 
such that the outcomes are less catastrophic or may increase the effectiveness of fire suppression 
by reducing resistance to control. Fire behavior alteration is accomplished by removing ladder 
fuels and reducing stand densities. Priorities for hazardous fuels reduction are to reduce surface 
and ladder fuels, raise the bottom of the live canopy, reduce stand density by thinning, and 
provide safe zones for firefighters. Some key findings from recent studies include: 
 
 Treatment location and juxtaposition and the treatments of surface fuels, ladder fuels and 
crown fuels (in order of importance) are major determinates of both wildfire intensity and 
burn severity. 
 98 
 
 The presence of fuels treatments directly impacted the survivability of structures.  Area 
fuel treatments adjacent to subdivisions provided important safety zones, increasing 
suppression effectiveness which saved houses. Fuel treatments, when of sufficient size, 
often provide safe zones for firefighters. 
 Fuel treatments that create irregular forest structures and compositions, both within and 
among stands (macro and micro mosaics), tend to produce wildfire resilient forests. 
 Fuel treatment longevity and effectiveness are dependent on location, dead and live fuel 
ratios, and rate, composition, and structure of vegetation recovery. Large fuel removal 
alone, without the follow-up treatment of smaller diameter fuels, may not provide 
adequate fuels reduction to prevent a fire from becoming stand-replacing. 
 Fuel treatments increase suppression effectiveness.  By modifying the fire’s behavior, 
fuel treatments present suppression opportunities that otherwise may not have been 
available. 
 
In addition to structures in the WUI there are other values to be considered for fuels treatments.  
In July 2007, The Pinchot Institute for Conservation released an assessment report titled 
“Protecting Front Range Forest Watershed from High Severity Wildfires”. Key findings in the 
report include: 
 
“When forests burn, watersheds also are affected and in the case of high-severity 
wildfires, watersheds are substantially altered.  Depending on intensity and duration, 
wildfires can change the soil composition of a watershed by consuming the litter layer at 
the surface of the soil and by destroying binding organic matter in the soil itself. A water-
repellent zone or layer forms when hydrophobic organic compounds from burning 
vegetation coat soil aggregates or minerals at or parallel to the surface. This hydrophobic 
layer prevents water from penetrating soil aggregates and seals off soil during rainfall 
events, which accelerates surface runoff resulting in the transport and deposit of 
sediments.  
 
The adverse impacts continue when the water, sediment and debris pour off slopes into 
receiving channels, scouring banks and bottoms, often overwhelming them and causing 
flooding, sometimes many miles away from the precipitating wildfire event. Such 
sediment and organic debris can dramatically alter water courses. 
 
Wildfires are not only a threat to water supplies but the sediment transport and organic 
debris flows that often follow wildfires can be even more problematic. If watersheds are 
not protected through mitigation projects such as fuel-breaks, then sediment and organic 
debris can destroy reservoirs as a functional part of the water supply system.” 
 
On National Forests in the State of Colorado from FY 2001 to 2009, an average of 
approximately 64,000 acres of fuels treatments occurred per year. There was an average of 4,400 
acres within the IRAs, 1,200 of which was mechanical treatments. There was an average of 
3,400 acres within the CRAs, 1,100 acres of which was mechanical treatments. Approximately 
19% of the acres treated within the IRAs occurred within 1.5 miles of the Forests on the Edge 
(FOTE) 2000 at-risk communities while 22% of the acres treated within the CRAs occurred 
within 1.5 miles of the FOTE 2000 at-risk communities. 
 99 
 
 
Wildland Urban Interface (Community Protection Zones) 
 
At-risk communities (ARCs) are generally those with homes or other structures with basic 
infrastructure and services (such as utilities and roads), in or adjacent to Federal land, in which 
conditions are conducive to a large-scale wildfire that may cause a significant threat to human 
life or property. In Colorado, there are currently 1,712 at-risk communities listed in the Federal 
Register (66 FR 751). For analysis purposes, housing density information from the National 
Forests on the Edge (FOTE) (see USDA Forest Service, 2010) analysis is used as a proxy for 
communities-at-risk. The FOTE data maps communities at-risk in Colorado in the year 2000 and 
projects the communities at risk in the year 2030, based on projections of housing growth. 
 
Census blocks identified as Rural II or Exurban/Urban (i.e., lands with 17 or more housing units 
per square mile) were buffered with an area defined as the “community protection zone” (CPZ). 
CPZ and WUI are used interchangeably in this analysis. The CPZ extends one-half mile from the 
boundary of an at-risk community, and up to one additional mile if any land exhibits one or more 
of the following characteristics: 
 
 Has a sustained steep slope that creates the potential for wildfire behavior endangering 
the at-risk community;  
 Has a geographic feature that aids in creating an effective fire break, such as a road or a 
ridge top; or 
 Is in condition class 3 as defined by HFRA. 
 
The delineation of the CPZ around communities was determined using the 0.5 mile default 
distance and 1.5 miles as the maximum CPZ distance. Approximately 6% and 25% of the 
roadless acres are within 0.5 mile and 1.5 mile respectively of the FOTE 2000 ARCs. Over 30% 
of the roadless acres on three National Forests, the Arapaho Roosevelt, Pike San Isabel and 
White River, are within 1½ miles of the FOTE 2000 at-risk communities. 
 
By 2030, it is projected that 35% or greater of the roadless acres on each of the forests will be 
within 1½ miles of the FOTE 2030 at-risk communities. Within 1 ½ miles of the 2000 FOTE at-
risk communities, approximately 43% of the IRA and CRA acreage is in Condition Class 2; and 
15% of the IRA acreage and 16% of the CRA acreage is in Condition Class 3. These areas are 
generally in need of some type of fuel treatment to reduce the wildland fire threat to the public 
and firefighters, as well as to reduce the hazard to communities, municipal water supplies, and 
other local resources. 
 
Analysis of Alternatives 
 
All fuel treatments; whether in roaded or roadless areas are performed to modify burning 
conditions. The fuel treatments are not performed to prevent fires but to alter fuel profiles so that 
public and firefighter safety is improved and communities, watershed, infrastructure, and other 
values-at-risk are less vulnerable to impacts from wildfire impacts. Fuel treatment projects 
around and within communities are performed to reduce fire hazard, thus reducing the potential 
damage to community resources and to increase the safety for the public and firefighters. 
 100 
 
 
The four alternatives vary in the ability to use temporary roads to facilitate tree-cutting, sale or 
removal activities for hazardous fuels management. Critical locations within roadless areas may 
not be treated if the area cannot be accessed by roads; restrictions on roads affects capacity to 
implement a combination of treatment practices involving prescribed fire and mechanical 
treatments. Prescribed fire alone, without mechanical treatments, is not likely to be a primary 
fuels treatment within the WUI due to risk of escape. 
 
Depending on the degree to which each alternative limits treatment activities in roadless areas, 
the following components of the wildland fire management program may be affected: 
 
 No alternative restricts the management response to a wildfire. 
 The inability to conduct vegetation treatments to create defensible fuels profiles in the 
WUI/CPZ and in areas outside of the WUI/CPZ could result in an increase in fire 
suppression costs, property loss, and other economic impacts.  
 Less hazardous fuels treatments can result in a higher risk of high-severity wildfires.  The 
inability to disrupt the flow of fire across the landscape could impact both prescribed fire 
and wildfire management.  
 Prohibitions on tree-cutting could result in fewer tactical options being available to fire 
management personnel. Areas where there have been fuel treatments present suppression 
opportunities that otherwise may not be available.  
 Depending on the point of ignition, as well as other factors, wildland fires could have the 
potential to become larger and more damaging as a result of no road access. Roads serve 
as fuel breaks, suppression fire lines, anchor points, and most importantly as safety zones 
for firefighters.  
 Roads provide efficient access for firefighting crews and other suppression resources 
such as engines and heavy equipment for fire line construction, as well as aviation 
support needs. A lack of access can increase the exposure of firefighters to possible 
injury due to an increased reliance on hand treatment methods resulting in multiple trips, 
longer periods of exposure, and exposure to multiple hazards including rolling materials, 
lifting and burns.  
 Larger and more damaging fires may result in the need for extensive and costly 
restoration and rehabilitation needs within roadless areas. The higher severity and larger 
fire size could result in increased adverse post fire effects due to erosion and slower 
vegetation recovery on community or municipal water supplies.   
 
As a measure of potential effects, each alternative was evaluated to determine the impact it 
would have on the ability to conduct hazardous fuels reduction treatments in the WUI/CPZ and 
the resulting impact on wildland fire management. For details about potential changes in the 
likelihood of fuel treatments within CPZ areas (acres), by county, see the “Local Governments: 
Fuels Treatments” section within “Distributional Effects” in this report. 
 
Fires can dramatically impact the amount of stored carbon released into the atmosphere. Stand-
replacing fires switch forest ecosystems from a carbon sink to a net source of carbon added to the 
atmosphere.  Fires are a natural part of much of the western landscape; however, they have been 
altered though fire suppression and other forest management activities.  Climate change is likely 
 101 
 
to increase the magnitude and frequency of fires in Colorado, as well as other Western states. 
Precise magnitude and rate of climate change is uncertain, especially at finer scales. General 
conclusions in the western United States include temperature and precipitation increases, but also 
high variability in annual precipitation, including severe drought.  As a majority of forest 
ownership in Colorado is on Federal lands, national forests are important for carbon storage.  
 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
This alternative is the most restrictive of the four alternatives in treating hazardous fuels. Under 
this alternative, tree-cutting, sale or removal is generally prohibited in IRAs with very limited 
exceptions. The one tree-cutting exception that could be used to reduce hazardous fuels is the 
cutting of generally small diameter timber to maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem 
composition and structure within the range of variability that would be expected to occur under 
natural disturbance regimes of the current climatic period. This exception would be utilized 
primarily in the ponderosa pine/Douglas fir and pinyon-juniper forest cover types. Lodgepole 
pine cover types rarely fit this exception. There is no corresponding road construction exception. 
Fuel reduction activities will generally consist of prescribed burning, mechanical treatments 
using existing roads, and hand treatments. 
 
Under this alternative the Forests project approximately 900 acres per year of mechanical fuels 
treatments (tree-cutting, sale or removal) within the IRAs. The analysis area outside of the IRAs, 
managed according to direction in the forest plans, have a projected 900 acres per year of 
mechanical fuels treatments. The Forests project an additional 500 acres per year of tree-cutting 
for purposes other than hazardous fuels reduction that may or may not modify fire behavior to 
meet desired conditions (not including incidental, administrative or personal use tree-cutting). 
Three hundred of the 500 acres are within IRAs and 200 acres are within the rest of the analysis 
area. Approximately 0.2% of the IRA acres will be treated per decade with an additional 2.6% of 
the analysis area outside of the IRAs treated per decade according to forest plan management 
direction. 
 
Indirect effects of this alternative include increased exposure of firefighters and/or contract 
workers to possible injury due to reliance on hand treatment methods. Further, the reduction of 
priority treated acres over time is likely to impact the ability to reduce threats to at-risk 
communities and other WUI values which may result in increase fire suppression costs, property 
loss and other economic impacts. The restrictions on treatments and road construction could 
result in fewer tactical options being available to fire management personnel (e.g., fewer roads to 
serve as fuel breaks, suppression firelines, anchor points, and most importantly as safety zones 
for firefighters). By modifying fire behavior, fuel treatments present suppression opportunities 
that otherwise may not have been available. The lack of established or temporary travel-ways 
may directly affect the efficiency and timeliness of wildland fire suppression response should it 
occur within an IRA. 
 
With the limited level of fuel treatments projected in this alternative, fire severity may be higher 
and fires may be larger.  The higher severity and larger fire size could (1) adversely affect critical 
resources such as wildlife habitat, vegetation, critical watersheds, and cultural resources, (2) 
result in the need for extensive and costly restoration and rehabilitation needs within roadless 
 102 
 
areas, and (3) result in increased adverse post fire effects due to erosion and slower vegetation 
recovery on community or agricultural water supplies as compared to other alternatives. The 
2001 Rule places the most limits on capacity to more strategically locate treatment areas on the 
landscape to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to reduce wildfire risks 
associated with National Forest lands as well as cumulatively across all ownerships. 
 
In general, the prohibition on road construction will result in less hazardous fuels treatment. Fuel 
reduction treatments will likely be focused in the substantially altered portion of the IRAs where 
there is existing roads. Other than in these roaded areas of the IRAs, fuel treatments that are 
completed are likely to be more expensive and less efficient to implement. This will result in the 
timeline for treating priority fuels being extended with incrementally increasing costs.  
 
There will be a higher risk of a high-severity wildfire than in the other alternatives because of the 
smaller amount of hazardous fuels treatments. The lack of tree-cutting and road construction will 
impact suppression opportunities and could result in the need for extensive and costly restoration 
and rehabilitation. 
 
The cumulative effect of climate change and excess fuels on wildfire severity and insect and 
disease outbreaks is relatively higher under the 2001 rule compared to the other alternatives. 
 
Colorado Roadless Rule (Alternative 2, Proposed Action) 
 
This alternative is less restrictive than alternatives 1 and 4, but more restrictive than alternative 3 
in treating hazardous fuels. Under this alternative, tree-cutting, sale, or removal is generally 
prohibited in CRAs with limited exceptions. Two of the tree-cutting exceptions are available 
within the CRAs to reduce hazardous fuels in all but the upper tier acres, where there is no tree-
cutting for this purpose. Within the CPZ, trees can be cut to reduce the wildfire hazard to an at-
risk community or municipal water supply system. The additional conditions that extend the CPZ 
beyond 0.5 miles are specific and may not allow for many additional treatments outside the ½ 
mile portion of the CPZ.  
 
Outside of the CPZ, trees can be cut to reduce the wildfire hazard to a municipal water supply 
system. Temporary road construction is allowed to facilitate the treatments within the first 0.5 
mile of the CPZ only. All of these treatments will focus on small diameter trees to create 
strategic fuel breaks while retaining large trees to the maximum extent practical to the forest 
type. Fuel reduction activities will generally consist of prescribed burning, mechanical 
treatments, and hand treatments.   
 
Under this alternative, the Forests project approximately 5,300 acres per year of mechanical fuels 
treatments (tree-cutting, sale or removal) in the CRAs, with the majority within the first ½ mile 
of the CPZ.  Approximately 12% of the CRA acres within 0.5 miles of the FOTE 2000 at-risk 
communities (the 0.5 CPZ) are in upper tier where no tree-cutting can be done for hazardous 
fuels treatments. This percentage increases to 13% of the CRA acres within 1.5 miles of the 
FOTE 2000 at-risk communities (the maximum 1.5 CPZ) are in upper tier where no tree-cutting 
can be done for hazardous fuels treatments. The analysis area outside of the CRAs, managed 
according to direction in the forest plans, have a projected 600 acres per year of mechanical fuels 
 103 
 
treatments. The Forests project an additional 1,100 acres per year of tree-cutting for purposes 
other than hazardous fuels reduction that may or may not modify fire behavior to meet desired 
conditions (not including incidental, administrative or personal use tree-cutting). Five hundred of 
the 1,100 acres are within CRAs and 600 acres are within the rest of the analysis area. 
Projections show that 1.3% of the CRA acres are treated per decade with an additional 2.6% of 
the “substantially altered acres” treated per decade according to forest plan direction. 
 
The increased flexibility for temporary road construction in the first 0.5 mile of the CPZ as 
opposed to alternative 1 could: reduce the costs of treatment; improve the efficiency of treatment 
implementation; increase the tools available to for fire prevention; and facilitate the removal and 
utilization of woody biomass from treated areas. All of these items assist in the ability to treat 
priority acres and achieve desired conditions.  
 
Although there is increased flexibility over alterative 1, critical locations outside the 0.5 mile 
CPZ may not be treated due to the limitations on temporary road construction. The alternative 
limits the purpose of hazardous fuels reduction outside of the CPZ to reducing the wildfire risk to 
municipal water supply systems only. Upper tier acres of the CRAs cannot have fuel treatments. 
 
There will be a higher risk of a high-severity wildfire than in alternative 3 but less than 
alternatives 1 or 4, because of the projected amount of hazardous fuels treatments. Although 
there is a tree-cutting exception and a temporary road construction exception for hazardous fuels 
treatment, the purpose and area available for treatment and temporary road construction is 
restricted. Analysis has shown that under moderate fire weather conditions, gusts of 20  mph 
produce spotting distance of over ½ miles and that under the influence of stronger gusts, such as 
those experienced from passing thunderstorms spotting distances in excess of 1.5 miles are 
possible from groups of Subalpine fir and lodgepole pine. Therefore the ½ mile may not be 
sufficient for community protection goals as spotting could easily breach the treatments. There 
may be critical locations in fire pathways that cannot be treated outside the CPZ. 
 
The higher severity and larger fire size could result in increased adverse post fire effects from 
erosion and slower vegetation recovery on community or agricultural water supplies as compared 
to other alternatives. Short term consequences may include potential impacts on wildlife, 
especially during periods of use; localized soil disturbance, and aesthetic qualities of the area. 
 
Although this alternative does not restrict the management response to a wildfire, the restrictions 
on treatments and road construction outside the CPZ could result in fewer tactical options being 
available to fire management personnel in these areas. With the level of treatments projected in 
this alternative there will be fewer areas that firefighters could utilize in suppression efforts than 
Alternative 3 but more than Alternative 1. Suppression opportunities will be impacted by the 
restrictions on tree-cutting and road construction. During the active life of the temporary roads 
constructed for hazardous fuels treatments, they will provide short term increased firefighting 
efficiencies in the event a fire starts in that area. In the event of a wildfire, there could be the 
need for extensive and costly restoration and rehabilitation. 
 
Other longer term environmental consequences may include loss of vegetation within the 
temporary road corridor and decreased aesthetic qualities associated with roadway closure 
 104 
 
through obliteration and rehabilitation. Additional effects, though likely to be minimal due to the 
temporary nature of the road, may include increased soil erosion, sedimentation, and 
compaction; and conduits for moving organisms across the landscape including invasive species. 
In contrast, roads may also serve as barriers that prevent or impede movement of some 
organisms. 
 
The cumulative effect of climate change and excess fuels on wildfire severity and insect and 
disease damage would be slightly reduced under Alternative 2, compared to Alternative 1 and 4, 
but greater than Alternative 3. 
 
 Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3, No  Action) 
 
This alternative is the least restrictive of the four alternatives in treating hazardous fuels. Under 
this alternative, tree-cutting, sale or removal and road construction follows the direction in the 
forest plans. Depending on the forest plan direction, this alternative provides the most 
management flexibility of the three alternatives. Under this alternative, the options available for 
fuel reduction include prescribed fire, mechanical treatment, and road construction as needed to 
facilitate treatment. 
 
Based on forest projections, approximately 13,100 acres per year of mechanical fuels treatments 
(tree-cutting, sale or removal) is projected to occur in the analysis area. The forests project an 
additional 3,600 acres per year of tree-cutting for purpose other than hazardous fuels reduction 
that may or may not modify fire behavior to meet desired conditions (not including incidental, 
administrative or personal use tree-cutting). Projections show 3.6% of the analysis area will be 
treated per decade under alternative 3.  
 
The increase in treatments being implemented reflects the ability of the forests to treat priority 
acres that are not easily treated under the other three alternatives. The increased flexibility for 
road construction would allow for cost effective and efficient implementation of hazardous fuels 
reduction projects as well as an efficient means of removing the resulting biomass. In addition, 
greater access would be available to do maintenance treatments in the long term and at-risk 
communities would receive substantial benefit from hazardous fuels reduction treatments. 
Alternative 3 places the fewest limits on capacity to strategically locate treatment areas on the 
landscape to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to reduce wildfire risks 
associated with National Forest lands as well as cumulatively across all land ownerships. 
 
This alternative would likely have increased positive benefits to wildland fire management 
including a reduction in the cost of suppression. The ability to treat areas without limitation as to 
the distance from the at-risk communities or purpose (i.e. watershed protection rather than 
municipal water supplies only) may result in reduced fire severity and adverse fire effects. There 
may be more areas that firefighters could utilize in suppression efforts with a reduction in 
firefighter exposure. The increase in projected roads would facilitate efficient initial attack 
response and increase firefighting efficiencies in both the short and long term during the active 
lifespan of the road. 
 
 105 
 
The cumulative effect of climate change and excess fuels on wildfire severity and insect and 
disease damage would be reduced the most under Alternative 3, compared to the other 
alternatives. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
This alternative is less restrictive than alternative 3, but more restrictive than alternatives 1 and 2 
in treating hazardous fuels. This alternative has the same prohibitions and exceptions as 
alternative 2. The difference is there are more upper tier acres where tree-cutting, sale or removal 
for hazardous fuels treatment is prohibited. As with alternative 2, fuel reduction activities 
allowed in this alternative will generally consist of prescribed burning, mechanical treatments, 
and hand treatments.   
 
Under this alternative the Forests project approximately 1,600 acres per year of mechanical fuels 
treatments (tree-cutting, sale or removal) in the CRAs, with the majority within the first ½ mile 
of the CPZ.  Approximately 48% of the CRA acres within 0.5 miles of the FOTE 2000 at-risk 
communities (the 0.5 CPZ) are in upper tier where no tree-cutting can be done for hazardous 
fuels treatments. This percentage increases to 52% of the CRA acres within 1.5 miles of the 
FOTE 2000 at-risk communities (the maximum 1.5 CPZ) are in upper tier where no tree-cutting 
can be done for hazardous fuels treatments. The analysis area outside of the CRAs, managed 
according to direction in the forest plans, have a projected 600 acres per year of mechanical fuels 
treatments. The Forests project an additional 800 acres per year of tree-cutting for purposes other 
than hazardous fuels reduction that may or may not modify fire behavior to meet desired 
conditions (not including incidental, administrative or personal use tree-cutting). Two hundred of 
the 800 acres are within the CRAs and 600 acres are in the remainder of the analysis area. 
Projections show that 0.4% of the CRA acres are treated per decade with an additional 2.6% of 
the “substantially altered acres” treated per decade according to forest plan direction. 
 
The decrease in projected treatments being implemented in roadless areas from alternative 2 
reflects the number of upper tier acres within the CRAs where tree-cutting for this purpose is 
prohibited.  
 
On the acres within the CRAs that are not upper tier, the treatment options and effects are 
identical as that listed in alternative 2. Because of the large number of upper tier acres in this 
alternative that are within the CPZ, there will be a higher risk of a high-severity wildfire than in 
alternative 2 or 3 but slightly less than alternative 1. Suppression opportunities will be impacted 
by the restrictions on tree-cutting and road construction. During the active life of the temporary 
roads constructed for hazardous fuels treatments, they will provide short term increased 
firefighting efficiencies in the event a fire starts in that area. In the event of a wildfire, there 
could be the need for extensive and costly restoration and rehabilitation.  
 
Public Health and Safety 
 
Under all alternatives, roads may be constructed or reconstructed in the roadless areas: (a) where 
needed to protect public health and safety in cases of threat of flood, fire, or other catastrophic 
event that, without intervention, would cause the loss of life or property (temporary roads only 
 106 
 
under the proposed rule); (b) where needed to conduct a response action under the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Section 
311 of the Clean Water Act, or the Oil Pollution Act; and (c) where needed to improve road 
safety of a forest road determined to be hazardous on the basis of accident experience or accident 
potential on that road. The Forest Service will therefore continue to respond, under all 
alternatives, to all potential public health and safety situations in roadless areas including 
response to wildfires, chemical or oil spills, abandoned mine hazards, road-design hazards, 
hazard trees, and others. Roads may be constructed or reconstructed in roadless areas for 
required health and safety responses. The roads built for these purposes would generally be 
temporary.  
   
The key difference among alternatives with respect to effects on public health and safety is 
related to how differences in the amount of roads in roadless areas influence agency response to 
public health and safety emergencies in those areas. Under the 2001 rule, the lower number of 
road miles projected to occur in roadless areas would continue to limit the responsiveness and 
timeliness to emergency health and safety situations that may arise in those areas. Under the 
Alternative 4, the proposed rule (Alternative 2), and even more so under Alternative 3, the 
respectively increasing number of road miles projected to occur in roadless areas may facilitate 
responses to emergency health and safety situations, however, upper tier acres in Alternatives 2 
and 4 do not have a specific public health and safety exception for road construction, as does 
alternative 1. 
 
In addition, as the projected road miles increase under Alternative 4, the proposed rule, and 
Alternative 3 respectively, there would be associated increases in the amount of management 
activities and vehicle traffic in those roadless areas. As the amount of management activity and 
traffic increases, so does the potential for increases in safety hazards and accidents. 
    
For mitigating risks associated with safety hazards at abandoned mines and some other non-
CERCLA safety issues, it is expected that most of these can be handled by means that do not 
require additional roading. 
 
Special Use Authorizations: Non-Recreational 
 
In Colorado, there are approximately 3,900 lands-related special use authorizations on NFS lands 
authorized to individuals, business entities, State and local governments, and other Federal 
agencies (for detailed discussion of special uses, see Lands – Special Use Authorizations in 
chapter 3 of the RDEIS). These uses include roads, reservoirs, weather and climate monitoring 
stations, communication lines and sites (for cellphone, radio, television, microwave, or other 
transmissions), railroads, service buildings of all types, electric transmission and distribution 
lines, oil and gas pipelines, ditches and other water conveyance facilities (see Recreation and Ski 
Areas sections for specials uses associated with recreation). These authorized uses provide a 
variety of products to individuals and the general public and are part of the multiple-use 
management mission of the Forest Service. The number of land use authorizations in the roadless 
areas in Colorado is not known at this time because of incomplete GIS spatial (map) information 
for each authorization. However, personnel from each NF in Colorado provided projections for 
 107 
 
new roads that would likely be needed to support current or anticipated land use authorizations in 
roadless areas. 
 
Where these kinds of special land use authorizations occur in the roadless areas in Colorado, they 
can result in both beneficial and detrimental effects on roadless area characteristics and values, 
depending on the use, the requirements and administration of the authorization, the responsibility 
taken by the holder of the authorization, environmental conditions, and personal values. 
 
The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) requires the Agency to provide 
access to private properties on public lands based on the reasonable use and enjoyment of the 
property. There are currently some private properties that require road access authorizations 
through portions of roadless areas. Additionally, there are currently authorized third-party-owned 
facilities in roadless areas that require some type of access in parts of some roadless areas. Roads 
built to access privately owned facilities or properties are constructed to minimum standards, 
based on site-specific analysis and resource conditions, and the planned use of the property. 
These roads are generally closed to public vehicle traffic. Proposed uses in the near future may 
include irrigation ditches, wells and other water systems, fences, access roads, powerlines, or 
other facilities. 
 
Temporary roads are sometimes built in roadless areas for emergency fire suppression purposes, 
other emergency situations, or as needed for public health and safety purposes. All alternatives 
would continue to allow temporary roads in roadless areas for those circumstances. 
 
The Department of Energy and BLM are leading the preparation of an EIS regarding designated 
energy corridors on Federal lands in 11 contiguous western states including Colorado. The 
RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010) does not indicate that energy corridor designations would 
go through IRAs or CRAs in Colorado. Currently there is one proposal for authorized use of 
NFS land in a roadless area (on the Routt NF) for development and operation of wind energy 
facilities.  
 
The Agency anticipates an increase in proposals for new reservoirs and associated water 
conveyance systems on NFS lands in the future. There is also the potential for proposals for new 
microwave, radio, or television communication facilities on NFS lands in roadless areas.    
 
Incidental tree removal occurs in roadless areas as needed to support special use authorizations 
for pipelines, utilities, water conveyance systems, and all other needs. Incidental tree-cutting 
would continue to be allowed in roadless areas under all alternatives. 
 
No alternative revokes, suspends or modifies any permit or other legal instrument authorizing the 
occupancy and use of NFS lands prior to the effective date of the rule. Forest plan direction that 
discourages or restricts the location of certain SUA facilities is followed in all alternatives and 
does not vary by alternative. 
 
The following land SUA facilities are evaluated in this report: oil and gas pipelines from sources 
located outside of roadless areas, electric power lines and telecommunications facilities, water 
conveyance structures, and a fourth category of all other land uses (including renewable energy 
 108 
 
facilities such as wind and solar). Oil and gas pipelines for existing leases within roadless areas 
are analyzed in the oil and gas section of this EIS.  
 
Oil and Gas Pipelines from Sources Located Outside of Roadless Areas 
 
There are existing oil and gas leases within and on lands adjacent to IRAs and CRAs. Pipelines 
are a necessary component of infrastructure for production and transportation of natural gas and 
fulfillment of lease rights. Construction or reconstruction of pipelines for existing leases within 
roadless areas does not vary by alternative. 
 
Agency policy reflects Bureau of Land Management (BLM) policy that recognizes authorized oil 
and gas pipeline construction does not require a road-- the area of disturbance for the installation 
of the pipeline is considered a linear construction zone. This analysis follows that policy and all 
pipelines located within roadless areas from sources outside of roadless areas are constructed or 
reconstructed using linear construction zones; as dictated by pipeline direction in each of the four 
alternatives.   
 
2001 Roadless Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
There is no rule language limiting the use of linear construction zones and no rule language 
limiting the location of future oil and gas pipelines in IRAs from sources outside of IRAs. Within 
the limits of forest plan direction, oil and gas pipelines can be constructed in IRAs from oil and 
gas leases located outside of IRAs using linear construction zones. Forests project 0.7 miles of 
LCZ annually to construct oil and gas pipelines from sources outside of roadless areas. 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action, Alternative 2) 
 
Construction of an oil and gas pipeline from a source or sources located exclusively outside of a 
CRA is prohibited after the [effective date of the rule] unless they connect to infrastructure 
within a CRA and the Regional Forester determines such a connection would cause substantially 
less environmental damage. Once it is determined that the pipeline will be located in a CRA, a 
linear construction zone can be used for its construction with a determination by the Regional 
Forester.  The upper tier acres follow this same direction. Forests project 0.7 miles of LCZ 
annually to construct oil and gas pipelines from sources outside of CRAs. 
 
If it is determined that the pipeline will not be located within a CRA, the decision may 
necessitate longer routes, and larger pipelines to increase capacity for the future. This may have 
an economic effect on the proponent and all other agencies involved because of limited siting 
locations.   
 
Forest Plan Direction (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
This alternative is the same as alternative 1. Forests project 1.1 miles of LCZ annually to 
construct oil and gas pipelines from sources outside of roadless areas. 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 109 
 
 
This alternative is the same as alternative 2. Forests project 0.7 miles of LCZ annually to 
construct oil and gas pipelines from sources outside of CRAs. 
 
Electrical Power Lines and Telecommunication Lines 
 
Electrical power lines and telecommunication lines currently are located in IRAs and CRAs. The 
agency will continue to receive proposals as energy sources are identified and developed. These 
energy sources need to be connected to the electrical grid. 
 
2001 Roadless Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
There is no rule language limiting the location of future electrical power lines and 
telecommunication lines in IRAs or limiting the use of linear construction zones for their 
construction, reconstruction or maintenance. If uses are authorized in IRAs in the future, there is 
no provision for road construction for the construction, operation or maintenance of electrical 
power lines or telecommunication lines. Within the limits of forest plan direction, electrical 
power lines and telecommunication lines could be constructed in IRAs using linear construction 
zones. Forests project 2.0 miles of LCZ annually to construct electrical power lines or 
telecommunications lines within IRAs. 
 
Not allowing roaded access to future proposed uses could create economic consequences and 
environmental effects if siting is located outside of IRAs (e.g., longer and more expensive 
construction of the linear facility, difficulty connecting to electrical grid, etc.). 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action, Alternative 2) 
 
Electrical power lines and telecommunication lines shall only be authorized within CRAs if a 
Responsible Official determines there is no opportunity for the project to be implemented outside 
of a CRA without causing substantially greater environmental damage. Once it is determined that 
the location will be within a CRA, the Regional Forester must determine a linear construction 
zone can be utilized for the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of existing or future 
authorized electrical power lines or telecommunication lines. The upper tier acres follow this 
same direction. Forests project 2.0 miles of LCZ annually to construct electrical power lines or 
telecommunications lines within CRAs. 
 
Not allowing roaded or LCZ access to future proposed uses could create economic consequences 
and environmental effects if siting is located outside of IRAs (e.g., longer and more expensive 
construction of the linear facility, difficulty connecting to electrical grid, etc.). 
 
Forest Plan Direction (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
Other than forest plan direction that discourages or restricts the location of certain SUA facilities 
or restricts road construction, electrical power lines and telecommunication lines can be 
constructed through IRAs. Roaded access or linear construction zones can be used. This can 
benefit the proponent by placing the electrical power line or telecommunication line in the most 
 110 
 
economically viable location for connection to the electrical grid.  Forests project 2.0 miles of 
LCZ annually to construct electrical power lines or telecommunications lines within the analysis 
area. 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
This alternative is the same as alternative 2. Forests project 2.0 miles of LCZ annually to 
construct electrical power lines or telecommunications lines within CRAs. 
 
Water Conveyance Structures 
As water needs increase throughout the country and drought cycles continue, holders are asking 
for authorization to expand and enlarge existing reservoirs and water conveyance structures. The 
agency also anticipates an increase in proposals for new reservoirs and the associated water 
conveyance systems on NFS lands. The location of water conveyance structures is only limited 
by forest plan direction and does not vary by alternative. What does change by alternative is how 
the water conveyance structures are constructed, reconstructed or maintained. Three of the 
alternatives allow for road construction for at least some of the future water conveyance structure 
SUAs. All of the alternatives allow for linear construction zones for at least some of the future 
water conveyance structure SUAs. 
 
2001 Roadless Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
If uses are authorized in IRAs in the future, there is no provision for road construction for the 
construction, operation or maintenance of water conveyance SUAs. Linear construction zones 
are not prohibited under this alternative so conceivably, any water conveyance structure could be 
constructed in an IRA under this alternative. Forests project 0.5 miles of LCZ within IRAs for 
this purpose.  
 
If roaded access is necessary, future water conveyance structures would not be located in IRAs. 
Not allowing roaded access to future proposed uses could create economic consequences and 
environmental effects if siting is located outside of IRAs (e.g., longer and more expensive 
construction of the linear facility, difficulty connecting to electrical grid, etc.). 
 
For currently authorized water conveyance structures, estimates are for 0.8 miles of road 
construction/reconstruction annually for IRA acres.  No construction/reconstruction is estimated 
for the additional CRA acres that are not roadless under this alternative.   
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action, Alternative 2) 
 
If uses are authorized in CRAs in the future, the Regional Forester must determine if road 
construction and linear construction zones are allowed and this is limited to authorized water 
conveyance structures operated pursuant to a pre-existing water court decree [as of the effective 
date of the rule].  In the upper tier acres, only linear construction zones could be used. Forests 
project 0.5 miles of LCZ within CRAs for this purpose.  
 
 111 
 
If roaded or linear construction zone access are necessary for future water conveyance structures 
that do not currently have a pre-existing water court decree, those conveyances cannot be located 
in CRAs. Not allowing roaded access to future proposed uses could create economic 
consequences and environmental effects if siting is located outside of IRAs (e.g., longer and 
more expensive construction of the linear facility, difficulty connecting to electrical grid, etc.). 
 
For currently authorized and future authorized water conveyance structures operated pursuant to 
a pre-existing water court decree, estimates are for 0.3 miles within CRAs and 0.5 miles within 
the remainder of the analysis area of road construction/reconstruction annually.  This will be 
beneficial to the proponents for these new facilities because it does not limit their most modern 
means of construction, operation and maintenance. 
 
Forest Plan Direction (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
Other than forest plan direction that discourages or restricts the location of certain SUA facilities 
or restricts road construction, water conveyance structures can be located in IRAs. This can 
benefit the proponent by placing the water conveyance structure in the most feasible and 
economically viable location.   
 
For currently authorized and future water conveyance structures within the analysis area, 
estimates are for 1.0 miles of road construction/reconstruction and 0.5 miles of LCZ annually. 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
This alternative is the same as alternative 2 with the exception that there are more upper tier 
acres under Alternative 4 compared to Alternative 2. Water conveyance structures in the upper 
tier acres can only use linear construction zones for their construction, reconstruction or 
maintenance. Forests project 0.5 miles of LCZs within CRAs annually for this purpose.  
 
If roaded or linear construction zone access are necessary for future water conveyance structures 
that do not currently have a pre-existing water court decree, those conveyances cannot be located 
in CRAs. Not allowing roaded access to future proposed uses could create economic 
consequences and environmental effects if siting is located outside of IRAs (e.g., longer and 
more expensive construction of the linear facility, difficulty connecting to electrical grid, etc.). 
 
For currently authorized and future authorized water conveyance structures operated pursuant to 
a pre-existing water court decree, estimates are for 0.2 miles of road construction/reconstruction 
annually within the CRAs and 0.5 miles within the remainder of the analysis area. 
 
All Other Special Land Uses 
 
As alternative energy sources are explored, proposals for wind energy testing and eventual build 
out, and solar facilities may become more prevalent.  Proposals for wind, solar, and geothermal 
development seem to focus on NFS lands adjacent to private land that is already being developed 
on ridge tops and on the National Grasslands.  Subject to forest plan direction, wind and solar 
facilities, and other SUA uses could be allowed under all alternatives. Depending on the 
 112 
 
alternative, road construction to these facilities may or may not be allowed. Depending on the 
alternative, a linear construction zone may or may not be allowed for the construction or 
maintenance of these facilities. 
 
2001 Roadless Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
If uses are authorized in IRAs in the future, there is no provision for road construction for the 
construction, operation or maintenance of SUAs. Linear construction zones are allowed under 
this alternative. Some SUAs may be able to be constructed or periodically maintained using a 
linear construction zone as opposed to a road. If roaded access is necessary, future water 
conveyance structures would not be located in IRAs. Not allowing roaded access to future 
proposed uses could create economic consequences and environmental effects if siting is located 
outside of IRAs (e.g., longer and more expensive construction of the linear facility, difficulty 
connecting to electrical grid, etc.). However, by not allowing road construction in IRAs, greater 
assurances are provided for preserving roadless area characteristics. 
 
For other uses authorized prior to [the effective date of the rule] estimates are for 0.4 miles of 
road construction/reconstruction annually.  No roads are projected for the additional CRA acres 
that are not within the roadless areas in this alternative. 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action, Alternative 2) 
 
Alternative 2 does not allow for roaded access or linear construction zones for any other future 
uses. This will necessitate siting all new facilities outside of CRAs if they would require 
motorized roaded or linear construction zone access for construction, operation and maintenance.  
This would limit options for siting, and could cause economic issues for the proponent by 
limiting options, and environmental concerns for the public and the agency.  Not allowing 
additional lands uses in CRAs may preserve some of the roadless area characteristics. 
 
Continued avoidance of CRAs for certain authorized third party uses necessitates siting in areas 
adjacent to the CRAs.  Allowing additional facilities outside of CRAs may conflict with visual 
and noise objectives for the individual CRA. Site specific NEPA analysis for these uses will 
allow for mitigation for potentially conflicting adjacent uses. 
 
For other uses authorized prior to [the effective date of the rule] estimates are for 0.1 miles of 
road construction/reconstruction annually within the CRAs and 0.3 miles annually in the 
substantially altered acres that are not within the CRAs in this alternative. 
 
Forest Plan Direction (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
Forest Plans may allow for all these uses, and the associated road construction or linear 
construction zones.  Forest Plans are normally silent on linear construction zones, and do not 
specifically prohibit them.  If not allowed under the current forest plan management direction, 
the Plan may be amended if necessary, with site and project specific NEPA. For other uses 
estimates are for 0.6 miles of road construction/reconstruction annually within the analysis area 
in this alternative. 
 113 
 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
This alternative is the same as Alternative 2 with the exception of greater numbers of upper tier 
acres. For other uses authorized prior to the effective date of the rule, no miles of road 
construction/reconstruction are projected within the CRAs and 0.3 miles annually in the 
substantially altered acres that are not within the CRAs in this alternative. 
 
Ski Areas 
 
This section evaluates effects of the alternatives on developed ski area recreation opportunities 
and experiences.  Developed ski areas are all those areas authorized under the Ski Area Permit 
Act of 1986 and have constructed facilities. For details about the evaluation of ski area impacts, 
see “Developed Ski Areas” section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Ski resorts are one of the major land use authorizations permitted on NFS lands in Colorado. 
Colorado has the highest number of ski areas under permit on NFs (22 areas) and the highest 
number of annual skier visits on NFs of any state, with 12.56 million skier visits for the 2006-07 
season, spending approximately 2.6 billion dollars annually. 
 
With the population growth in many of the key western ski states, as well as overall income 
growth, the rising ski area visitor trend is projected to continue into the foreseeable future.  The 
settings, experience, and activities usually associated with ski areas are more in line with the 
developed end of the recreation opportunity spectrum (ROS).  Some NFS lands adjacent to 
developed ski areas in Colorado are roadless and fall into the semi-primitive non-motorized, or 
semi-primitive motorized, ROS classes.  This means expansions of ski areas may directly impact 
the adjacent NF lands roadless characteristics and move these areas into the more developed end 
of the ROS spectrum in the winter.  Summer use in and around ski resorts is also growing, which 
may also push the ROS class in the summer to the more developed end of the spectrum. 
 
 Analysis of Alternatives 
 
2001 Rule 
 
By maintaining the restrictions on future road construction or reconstruction and tree-cutting, 
sale or removal activities within IRAs, opportunities for ski area development and expansion at 
some ski areas would be limited. In other ski areas this alternative would have no effect on 
developed ski area recreation in the 15-year planning time frame. Currently, 6,550 NFS acres are 
within IRAs and were under a ski area permit prior the final date of this rule.  In these areas, road 
construction and tree-cutting activities are allowed to continue according to master ski area 
plans. 
 
In the case of Loveland Ski Area and Durango Mountain Resort, the forest plan allocation for the 
ski area is larger than the existing permit area. Under alternative 1, no road construction or 
reconstruction may occur outside the existing permit boundary established prior to the date of 
this rule; including those areas that have been allocated under forest plans.  
 114 
 
 
Ski area development can still occur without road construction in IRAs.  Over the snow 
construction of lift towers can be accomplished in some locations, similarly, tree-cutting, sale or 
removal can be completed over snow to clear ski trails and runs without the construction of 
roads.  Therefore, it is possible that ski area expansion into roadless areas may occur without 
road construction in areas that are not currently under permit, but it would be limited. 
 
Under alternative 1, although there would be limitations on future ski area expansion, 
backcountry skiing would continued to be enjoyed by those users who prefer roadless 
opportunities. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Alternative 2; Proposed Action) 
 
Under this alternative, ski areas that are permitted or allocated by forest plans are not included 
within CRAs boundaries. Therefore, road construction or reconstruction and tree-cutting, sale or 
removal in those ski areas (outside CRAs) would be allowed as prescribed in the forest plans, ski 
area master plans, and project-level NEPA documents.  
 
In the future, if the Forest Service authorizes a ski permit boundary to expand into a CRA, road 
construction could not occur on those CRA acres. However, like Alternative 1, ski area 
development could occur without road construction and it would be permissible to cut trees 
where incidental to the implementation of a permitted ski area management activity not 
otherwise prohibited in a CRA, such as to create a new ski run. Such ski area expansions without 
road construction could take place in upper tier acres as well as regular CRA acres. 
 
As areas allocated under a forest plan are not included within the CRA boundaries, there is 
potential for further development and expansion, compared to alternative 1, of an additional 
1,710 acres. The authorization of roads in developed ski areas would facilitate the 
implementation of required ski area vegetation management plans to improve forest health, 
remove hazard trees, and manage fuel hazards associated with the current mountain pine beetle 
epidemic affecting lodgepole pine within developed ski areas. 
 
If road construction and tree removal are authorized in developed ski areas and a decision is 
made to expand the permit boundary at Durango Mountain Resort and Loveland Ski Area, there 
would likely be a change of the ROS from semi-primitive non-motorized to semi-primitive 
motorized or roaded natural within those areas. 
 
 Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3; No Action) 
 
 
Under this alternative the potential to construct roads, cut trees, and develop more ski facilities in 
the ski areas would be the same as under alternative 2 or 4. If a currently undeveloped ski area is 
developed in the future under alternative 2, 3, or 4, there would be a higher potential for semi-
primitive non-motorized setting to shift to semi-primitive motorized or roaded natural setting. 
Benefits to the developed ski area recreation resource would be the same as described in 
alternative 2 or 4. 
 115 
 
 
Under alternative 3, ski areas can potentially construct roads to expand their permit boundaries in 
any direction, without a rule-related roadless area constraint. Under alternative 2, 3, or 4, forest 
plan management direction may still constrain road construction or tree-cutting activities related 
to ski area development or expansion. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier 
 
The effects are the same as under alternative 2.This is due to the fact that the permitted ski area 
acres are removed from Colorado Roadless Areas. In the upper tier, including the expanded 
upper tier, ski area expansion could occur without road construction. 
 
 
Other Resources, Services, and Programs 
 
 Livestock Management 
 
Livestock grazing is managed in portions of many of the roadless areas. In addition to actively 
grazed allotments (lands allocated to grazing management), there are a number of vacant 
allotments where there is no current grazing permit in effect, but where livestock grazing may be 
permitted in the future. Permitted livestock may include cattle, sheep, or other kinds of livestock 
such as horses. Authorized livestock grazing use occurs less extensively in the roadless areas 
compared to many other portions of the NFs and national grasslands in Colorado due to forage 
cover type. 
 
Under the 2001 Rule, the proposed action (Alternative 2), and Alternative 4,  road construction 
exceptions do not exist for the purpose of livestock grazing. However, those who have grazing 
permits for allotments in roadless areas have been effectively managing their livestock in those 
areas over long time periods without the necessity of additional roads. They typically rely on 
pack and saddle stock to manage the livestock and maintain their range improvement structures. 
Range management personnel on the NFs in Colorado do not foresee a need for additional roads 
in roadless areas in support of livestock grazing management in those areas over the next 15 
years under any alternative (see “Livestock Management” in chapter 3 of RDEIS).  
 
Road and tree-cutting activities can affect rangeland vegetation and result in detrimental effects 
to livestock management. However, under any of the alternatives, there would be a low 
likelihood that the projected new roads would significantly affect authorized livestock 
management use in the roadless areas. Recent tree-cutting activities such as for fuel reduction or 
forest health treatments have not typically resulted in significant adverse impacts on permitted 
grazing management in those affected allotments. While the Forest Plans alternative would pose 
the highest potential for adverse impacts on livestock grazing management in roadless area 
allotments, there would be no substantial difference in risk to livestock operations under any of 
the alternatives. Under all alternatives the risk would be low for the potential tree-cutting 
activities to result in significant adverse impacts on livestock management in roadless areas. 
 
 
 116 
 
 Saleable Minerals 
 
A small fraction of this production from NFS lands, if any, is estimated to have come from 
roadless areas (a specific spatial breakdown of amounts of mineral materials generated from 
IRAs is not available). This minor production from roadless areas would likely have been free 
use disposals for public road projects, or for local Forest Service use, and then only where roads 
already exist or are being constructed under an allowed exception. The projected amount of 
saleable materials that would come from within roadless areas during the next 15 years is 
assumed to be little to none, and no roads would likely be constructed or reconstructed for the 
purpose of developing commercial mineral material sites, suggesting that there are no significant 
differences in effects to this sector across alternatives. 
 
 Locatable Minerals 
 
Locatable minerals (e.g., base and precious metals: gold, silver, zinc) are appropriated through 
the location of mining claims under the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended (Mining 
Law). This law provides U.S. citizens a possessory right to these minerals, use of the surface 
reasonably incident to mining, and a right to reasonable access to these minerals across Federal 
land.  IRAs are not withdrawn from the location of new mining claims and these new mining 
claims will have the same rights under the mining laws as mining claims outside IRAs. None of 
the alternatives differ in projections for roading related to future locatable mineral activity in 
roadless areas. Under all alternatives, less than ¼-mile per year of roading is projected by the 
forests to occur in the roadless areas during the next 15 years for the purposes of locatable 
mineral exploration or development. Overall, the alternatives do not differ in permissions or 
prohibitions related to extraction of locatable minerals. 
 
 
Analysis of Roadless Area Characteristics 
 
Scenic Quality 
 
Roadless area characteristics and values typically include “natural-appearing landscapes with 
high scenic quality. High quality scenery, especially scenery with natural-appearing landscapes, 
is a primary reason that people choose to recreate. Quality scenery contributes directly to real 
estate values in neighboring communities and residential areas, as noted in chapter 1 of the 
RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). Scenic quality is based on two definable elements, 
landscape character and scenic integrity. Roadless areas inherently have high scenic quality 
because of the lack of human-induced disturbance. 
 
The scenic quality of a forest is not static; it changes over time. To varying degrees, roads and 
tree cutting and removal activities in a roadless area can affect the scenic integrity of that 
landscape. The positive effects on scenic quality that can result from management activities that 
reduce insect and disease mortality in forest stands or the severity of a wildfire, may be offset by 
the negative effects of road construction and vegetative treatments. However, wildfire events, 
insect or disease infestations, avalanches, and other natural events are considered a part of that 
landscape’s natural processes. Within the Forest Service’s scenery management classification 
 117 
 
system, such natural disturbance events and resultant landscape changes (even if visually 
unappealing) are consistent with high or very high levels of scenic integrity.   
 
All resource management activities in roadless areas in Colorado strive to achieve long-term 
sustainable landscape character goals  in the scenic integrity objectives (SIOs) identified in the 
land management planning process using the Scenery Management System (SMS) or with 
establishment of visual quality objectives (VQOs) using the Visual Management System (VMS). 
These visual or scenic management objectives define allowable levels of change on specific land 
areas (see “Scenic Quality” section of the revised DEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010) for details 
about these systems and scenic quality analysis). 
 
Generally, the current condition of roadless areas in Colorado does not show extensive evidence 
of management activities. Thus, the roadless areas currently have a high degree of scenic 
integrity. There is evidence of some roads, past tree cutting and other management activities in 
portions of the IRAs. In many of those areas, the scenic integrity has likely been modified and 
the resulting scenic integrity is considered moderate to low. The substantially altered areas in 
IRAs do not meet the desired scenic quality conditions for maintaining roadless area 
characteristics and values.  
 
Analysis of Alternatives 
 
When considering the effects described below, it should be noted that population growth and 
increasing development on lands adjacent to roadless areas can have a cumulative impact on 
scenic quality. 
 
 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
The 2001 Roadless Rule is anticipated to maintain high levels of scenic integrity in the roadless 
areas. By maintaining the restrictions or limitations on future road construction or reconstruction 
and tree-cutting activities within IRAs, the scenic quality would remain substantially unaltered 
by future management activities, consistent with High to Very High SIO’s or Retention to 
Preservation VQO’s. 
 
The 2001 Roadless Rule would allow road construction under limited situations. About 11 miles 
per year of road construction/reconstruction are projected to occur within the IRAs and an 
additional 3 miles per year within the remainder of the analysis area over the next 15 years under 
this alternative, the majority of these would be temporary roads associated with existing oil and 
gas or coal leases.  It is anticipated that the amount of change from such new road construction 
would have a negligible change on the current High and Very High scenic integrity in most 
roadless areas. In those few areas where roads are constructed, the scenic integrity could change 
from High to Low or Moderate. 
 
There are existing oil and gas leases within the IRAs as well as existing coal leases. The 
disturbance in these areas, which includes both road construction and tree-cutting, while 
operations are ongoing, can be expected to have an impact on the scenic value.  However, as 
 118 
 
areas are reclaimed and roads are removed, the scenic values will increase over time, 
commensurate with the revegetation.  
 
The 2001 Roadless Rule would allow limited tree-cutting of generally small-diameter material 
for specific purposes within IRAs. About 1,200 acres within the IRAs and an additional 1,100 
acres within the remainder of the analysis area are anticipated to be treated annually over the 
next 15 years. The intensity of change associated with such activities is not expected to create a 
measurable change in scenic integrity, though there could be minor localized effects. The 
magnitude or amount of area per project that would potentially be affected is also considered to 
be relatively minor, typically several hundred acres or less. Vegetation management would result 
in short-term changes in scenic quality. These projected activities would be spread out over very 
large acreages. 
 
Based on the anticipated intensity and magnitude of change from potential vegetation 
management, it is anticipated that the most of the current High and Very High scenic integrity 
within all IRAs would be retained. 
 
Retaining the substantially altered areas and developed ski areas inside the roadless areas would 
allow portions of the roadless areas to continue to depart from desired roadless area 
characteristics and values regarding scenic quality.   
 
The acres within the analysis area that are not within the IRAs have been identified by the forests 
as having roadless area characteristics and are most likely High/Retention and Very 
High/Preservation scenic integrity. Where tree-cutting, sale or removal and road construction is 
projected to occur, the SIO/VQO’s could change on those acres from High/Retention to 
Moderate/Partial Retention.    
 
By not allowing new roading to improve forest health or reduce hazardous fuels, this alternative 
would pose a higher risk of having large-scale insect-disease outbreaks and high-severity 
wildfires, compared to the other alternatives. However, natural disturbance events that change 
the landscape appearance would not change the scenic integrity level. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed rule; Alternative 2) 
 
Under this alternative limiting human activities in CRAs helps minimize adverse modifications 
to existing scenic quality. Removing the substantially altered areas and developed ski areas from 
the CRAs and redefining the CRA boundaries to include areas with roadless area characteristics 
would increase values regarding scenic quality.   
 
Annually, 16 miles of road construction are projected within the CRAs and an additional 4 miles 
within the remainder of the analysis area. Most of these roads are temporary roads, including 
those temporary roads associated with existing oil/gas and existing and future coal leases within 
the North Fork coal mining area and all would be decommissioned following the specific 
permitted use. It is anticipated that the amount of change from such new road construction would 
have a negligible change on the current High and Very High scenic integrity in most roadless 
 119 
 
areas. In those few areas where roads are constructed, the scenic integrity could change from 
High to Low or Moderate. 
 
There are existing oil and gas leases within the CRAs as well as existing coal leases. In the 
future, an additional 16,000 acres within the North Fork coal mining area is available for future 
coal leases including road construction. The disturbance in these areas, which includes both road 
construction and tree-cutting, while operations are ongoing, can be expected to have an impact 
on the scenic value.  However, as areas are reclaimed and roads are removed, the scenic values 
will increase over time, commensurate with the revegetation.  
 
Limited tree-cutting, sale or removal is permissible in CRAs, primarily to reduce the wildfire 
hazard to at-risk communities or municipal water supply systems. Annually tree-cutting, sale or 
removal is projected to occur on about 5,800 acres within the CRAs, the majority within the 
CPZ. Forests project an additional 1,200 acres of tree-cutting annually within the remainder of 
the analysis area. Tree-cutting within the CRAs, other than for the purpose of incidental, 
personal, or administrative, must maintain or improve one or more of the roadless area 
characteristics over the long-term.  
 
Tree-cutting could modify scenic integrity at least in the short term, but is assumed to maintain at 
least a Moderate/Partial Retention level of scenic quality. In the long term SIO/VQO’s associated 
with these tree-cutting treatments would result in High/Retention to Very High/Preservation 
scenic levels.  It is likely that tree-cutting would be spread across multiple roadless areas across 
the State, thus reducing the potential change in any one CRA. Also, potential effects across 
CRAs would be moderated because of priority treatment of hazardous fuels would be 
concentrated around communities. These treatments would minimize impacts to communities by 
applying SIOs and VQOs guidelines from forest plans. 
 
Based on the anticipated intensity and magnitude of change from potential vegetation 
management, it is anticipated that the most of the current High and Very High scenic integrity 
within all upper tier acres would be retained due to the limited activities allowed. 
Removing the substantially altered areas and developed ski areas from the roadless areas allows 
these areas to be managed according to forest plan direction regarding scenic quality which may 
no longer reflect roadless area characteristics.  However, the substantially altered acres were 
specifically removed because they currently do not reflect roadless characteristics. The additional 
CRA acres added to the inventory are mostly High/Retention and Very High/Preservation scenic 
integrity and would be retained as such due to the limited activities allowed under alternative 2 
over the long-term.  
 
Forest Plans (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
This alternative would incur the highest risk of increased adverse impacts to existing scenic 
quality. This is because this alternative allows for the most additional road construction or 
reconstruction and tree-cutting, sale or removal activities in IRAs as defined by individual Forest 
Plans.  Based on the forest plan restrictions on activities within the areas analysis area including 
within the IRAs, together with topographic or economic constraints, new roads or tree-cutting 
 120 
 
activities would be projected to occur on only a small percentage of the existing roadless area 
acreage.  
 
Management prescriptions similar to Wilderness/Primitive settings are likely to retain their 
High/Retention to Very High/Preservation SIO/VQO’s because limited activity is permitted to 
occur in these areas. Generally natural processes dominate.  
Annually within the analysis area, approximately 28 miles of road are projected to be constructed 
or reconstructed and tree-cutting, sale or removal is projected to occur on approximately 16,900 
acres.  
 
There are existing oil and gas leases within the analysis area as well as existing coal leases. 
Under this alternative, future leasing can occur.  The disturbance in these areas, which includes 
both road construction and tree-cutting, while operations are ongoing, can be expected to have an 
impact on the scenic value.  However, as areas are reclaimed and roads are removed, the scenic 
values will increase over time, commensurate with the revegetation.  
 
Scenic quality could be reduced in areas where road construction/reconstruction occurs. In areas 
with prescriptions similar to the Backcountry theme, it is likely that scenic quality would not be 
reduced as much because these prescriptions generally encourage the use of temporary roads 
(short-term impact) and retention of more trees because of wildlife considerations. There may be 
some beneficial effects on scenic quality from silvicultural and fuels treatments that reduce the 
potential magnitude of natural events such as insect infestations and wildland fires. Also, 
potential effects would be moderated because of priority treatment of hazardous fuels around 
communities and by applying SIOs and VQOs guidelines from forest plans. 
  
Potential effects in all IRAs would be moderated because of priority treatment of hazardous fuels 
around communities and by applying SIO and VQO guidelines from the forest plans alternative. 
 
 Colorado Proposed Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
Under this alternative limiting human activities in CRAs helps minimize adverse modifications 
to existing scenic quality. Removing the substantially altered areas and developed ski areas from 
the CRAs and redefining the CRA boundaries to include areas with roadless area characteristics 
would increase values regarding scenic quality.   
 
Annually, 14 miles of road construction are projected within the CRAs and an additional 4 miles 
within the remainder of the analysis area. Most of these roads are temporary roads, including 
those temporary roads associated with existing oil/gas and existing and future coal leases within 
the North Fork coal mining area. All would be decommissioned following the specific permitted 
use. It is anticipated that the amount of change from such new road construction would have a 
negligible change on the current High and Very High scenic integrity in most roadless areas. In 
those few areas where roads are constructed, the scenic integrity could change from High to Low 
or Moderate. 
 
There are existing oil and gas leases within the CRAs as well as existing coal leases. In the 
future, an additional 16,000 acres within the North Fork coal mining area is available for future 
 121 
 
coal leases including road construction. The disturbance in these areas, which includes both road 
construction and tree-cutting, while operations are ongoing, can be expected to have an impact 
on the scenic value.  However, as areas are reclaimed and roads are removed, the scenic values 
will increase over time, commensurate with the revegetation.  Those acres within the upper tier 
acres that have existing oil/gas leases would continue to allow development according to lease 
stipulations and may not provide additional scenic quality until after operations have been 
completed and reclaimed. 
 
Limited tree-cutting, sale or removal is permissible in CRAs, primarily to reduce the wildfire 
hazard to at-risk communities or municipal water supply systems. Annually tree-cutting, sale or 
removal is projected to occur on about 1,800 acres within the CRAs, the majority within the 
CPZ. Forests project an additional 1,200 acres of tree-cutting annually within the remainder of 
the analysis area. Tree-cutting within the CRAs, other than for the purpose of incidental, 
personal, or administrative, must maintain or improve one or more of the roadless area 
characteristics over the long-term and would be limited to those acres not within the upper tier.  
 
Tree-cutting outside the upper tier acres could modify scenic integrity at least in the short term, 
but is assumed to maintain at least a Moderate/Partial Retention level of scenic quality. In the 
long term SIO/VQO’s associated with these tree-cutting treatments would result in 
High/Retention to Very High/Preservation scenic levels.  It is likely that tree-cutting would be 
spread across multiple roadless areas across the State, thus reducing the potential change in any 
one CRA. Also, potential effects across CRAs would be moderated because of priority treatment 
of hazardous fuels would be concentrated around communities that are not within the upper tier. 
These treatments would minimize impacts to communities by applying SIOs and VQOs 
guidelines from forest plans. 
 
Based on the anticipated intensity and magnitude of change from potential vegetation 
management, it is anticipated that the most of the current High and Very High scenic integrity 
within all upper tier acres would be retained due to the limited activities allowed. 
 
Removing the substantially altered areas and developed ski areas from the roadless areas allows 
these areas to be managed according to forest plan direction regarding scenic quality which may 
no longer reflect roadless area characteristics.  However, the substantially altered acres were 
specifically removed because they currently do not reflect roadless characteristics. The additional 
CRA acres added to the inventory are mostly High/Retention and Very High/Preservation scenic 
integrity and would be retained as such due to the limited activities allowed under alternative 4 
over the long-term. 
 
Wilderness and Recommended Wilderness 
 
In 1964, Congress established a National Wilderness Preservation System, composed of 
federally owned areas designated by Congress as “wilderness areas” (16 U.S.C. 1131–1136, 78 
Stat 890). A wilderness is recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are 
untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain, and where motorized 
equipment and transport, development, and commercial enterprise are prohibited. In addition, a 
wilderness is said to generally appear to be affected by the forces of nature; have opportunities 
for primitive and unconfined recreation; are of sufficient size (typically greater than 5,000 acres) 
 122 
 
to be managed as wilderness; and contain other ecological, geological, scientific, educational, 
scenic, or historical values. 
 
The Wilderness Act does not constrain projects proposed adjacent to wilderness boundaries 
because of the mere presence of wilderness. The effects from projects adjacent to wilderness 
areas should not be the sole reason for deferring or declining a project proposal.  
 
Recommended wilderness areas are lands identified in land management plans as having 
undeveloped character and wilderness potential through forest planning. Forest plan management 
direction calls for managing recommended wilderness areas to maintain wilderness 
characteristics and values until such time as Congress acts upon the Agency recommendation or 
a different agency recommendation is made. 
 
There are a total of 35 designated wilderness areas in Colorado comprising 3,200,000 acres. 
Approximately 87,500 acres within the roadless analysis area have been recommended for 
wilderness in land management plans (see “Wilderness” in chapter 3 of the RDEIS). 
 
 Analysis of Alternatives 
 
None of the three alternatives, including the proposed action, will have a direct effect on 
designated wilderness, because these areas are outside of IRAs or CRAs. The effects to areas 
recommended as wilderness in land management plans, likewise, do not differ across 
alternatives, because land management plans generally prohibit road construction and tree-
cutting and removal activities in those areas. 
 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
The 2001 rule generally prohibits tree cutting and road building in IRAs and therefore, retains 
the existing roadless area characteristics, so it would not detract from wilderness characteristics 
(e.g., solitude, scenery) in the adjacent wilderness areas. However, the amount of projected road 
construction and tree cutting activities, and road-related increases in energy resource operations 
in roadless areas under the 2001 rule would affect some wilderness characteristics in wilderness 
areas adjacent to IRAs where activity occurs, due to the increases in noise and human 
disturbances in the IRAs that may be heard or seen by people in the adjacent wildernesses. 
However, it is likely that very few projects would occur adjacent to wilderness. 
 
The restrictions on activities in IRAs under this alternative provide a greater opportunity to 
maintain future options for recommending roadless acres as wilderness, compared to the 
proposed action or the forest plans alternative. 
 
Alternative 1 would not directly affect any of the recommendations made in forest plans for 
recommended wilderness areas as existing plans generally exclude tree-cutting and road 
construction activities in recommended wilderness unless a site-specific amendment was 
completed. 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action; Alternative 2) 
 123 
 
Like the 2001 rule, the general prohibitions on roading and tree cutting under the proposed action 
would minimize the potential risk of detracting from wilderness characteristics or experience in 
adjacent wilderness areas. However, the risk of potential impacts would be higher than under the 
2001 rule due to increases in the projected levels of roading, tree cutting, and energy resource 
operations in CRAs, and the corresponding potential for increases in noise and human 
disturbance that may be seen or heard from adjacent wilderness. In particular, the projected 
activities in the North Fork Coal Mining Area would potentially impact the solitude and other 
wilderness experience opportunities in the adjacent West Elk wilderness. 
   
By allowing more roading and tree-cutting activities in CRAs, this alternative could reduce the 
number of roadless acres that might have characteristics that could support future wilderness 
recommendations, compared to the 2001 rule. 
 
For those acres included as upper tier in alternative 2, they will also be more consistent with 
future wilderness designation than either alternative 1 direction or general forest plan direction 
due to the additional restrictions on activities. 
 
Implementation of the alternative 2, with 562,300 acres assigned to upper tier roadless areas, 
would help establish a uniform approach to managing areas already identified in forest plans and 
draft forest plans as being recommended for wilderness or being similar to wilderness in 
management.  It should be noted that upper tier acres may not necessarily meet the conditions for 
recommended wilderness as defined by the Forest Service handbook.  Any changes to that 
direction would require a rule-making effort. 
 Forest Plans (No Action; Alternative 3) 
In general, Alternative 3 allows more risk of potential impacts from tree-cutting and road 
construction than alternatives 1, 2 or 4.  The risk of detracting from wilderness characteristics in 
adjacent wilderness areas would be highest under Alternative 3 due to the higher levels of road 
construction and tree-cutting activity projected for IRAs. In particular, the projected activities in 
the North Fork Coal Mining Area would potentially impact the solitude and other wilderness 
experience opportunities in the adjacent West Elk wilderness. 
 
The relative amount of projected activity (road construction and tree-cutting) under Alternative 
3, could affect a greater number of roadless acres that could potentially be considered for 
wilderness in the future, compared to other alternatives. 
 
Under some existing forest plans, recommended wilderness has been identified and those areas 
will continue to be managed as recommended wilderness. Currently, there are 12 areas 
(approximately 87,500 acres) identified in existing plans as recommended for wilderness 
designation within Colorado.  Other Colorado Roadless Areas were not recommended for 
wilderness because they fall short of the Agency’s recommended wilderness evaluation criteria, 
(FSH 1909.12, Chapter 70). Effects on roadless characteristics in light of the prohibitions on 
these other Colorado Roadless Areas are evaluated in the other sections. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
 124 
 
In general, alternative 4 impacts will be similar to alternative 2. There will be additional acres 
included as upper tier in alternative 4, but these acres may not necessarily meet the conditions for 
recommended wilderness as defined by the Forest Service handbook, but some acres will be 
subject to additional restrictions of the upper tier. The upper tier acres in alternative 4 do overlap 
with existing oil and gas leases that allow for road construction, such activities will be allowed to 
continue under the conditions of the rule language, but over the long term, these areas will be 
managed for upper tier roadless area characteristics. 
 
Implementation of the alternative 4 with 2.6 million acres in the upper tier would establish a 
uniform approach to managing over half the CRA acres (similar to the 562,300 upper tier acres 
under Alternative 2). Any changes to that direction would require a rule-making effort. The 
selection of the alternative 4 upper tier acres is not specifically based on wilderness criteria. 
 
Other Congressionally or Administratively Designated Areas and Trails 
 
There are six congressionally designated areas in Colorado, established by the 1980 or 1993 
Colorado Wilderness Acts, and the James Peak Wilderness and Protection Area Act of 2002 
(P.L. 107-216).  These areas include about 165,500 acres, 147,600 acres are in the 2001 rule IRA 
boundaries. Colorado has only one congressionally designated river, the Cache la Poudre River 
on the Arapaho-Roosevelt NF. There is a small part of the congressionally designated river in the 
Comanche Peak Adjacent Area and the Green Ridge East roadless areas (IRA and CRA). The 
designation protects 61 miles of river under Forest Service administration in the following 
classifications:  16 miles of wild classification and 45 miles as recreation classification. Congress 
has also enacted the National Trails System Act (P.L. 90-543) on October 2, 1978, which 
established a nationwide trail system, including the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, 
part of which is in Colorado. 
 
The congressionally designated areas are not included in IRAs being analyzed in this EIS. There 
would be no difference in management of these protected areas under any of the alternatives. In 
addition, none of the alternatives would directly impact any of these congressionally designated 
areas, outside roadless areas. Similarly, none of the alternatives would directly impact the 
stretches of the wild and scenic river corridor classified as “wild” or “recreation,” because the 
statute designating the river is equally or more restrictive compared to any of the alternatives in 
terms of roading and tree-cutting (i.e., the law does not allow activities that would degrade those 
values for which the river corridor was designated). Due to similar statutory precedence, none of 
the altenatives would alter the management or scenic values of the Continental Divide National 
Scenic Trail. 
 
However, there could be indirect effects from projected activities that vary by alternative, on the 
characteristics or values of the adjacent designated areas noted above. Indirect impact would be 
minimal under the 2001 rule, greater under the proposed rule, and greatest under the forest plans 
alternative, based on the relative amounts of roading, tree-cutting and road-related energy 
development activities projected to occur in the adjacent roadless areas16. 
                                                 
16 Exceptions being that the Fossil Ridge Recreation Area, James Peak Protection Area and Bowen Gulch Protection 
Area allow some motorized and mechanized travel and some other activities. Thus, increases in noise and human 
 125 
 
 
None of the alternatives project roading, or tree-cutting activities in the administratively 
designated areas such as research natural areas (RNAs) or special interest areas (SIAs). Thus, 
there would be no difference in effects predicted to occur in roadless area RNAs or SIAs under 
any of the alternatives. Under the forest plans alternative, road building could potentially occur 
in the future in RNAs or SIAs in roadless areas, where it is not entirely prohibited. Some land 
management plans allow roads or facilities to be built in RNAs or SIAs, although the values for 
which the area was established would need to be maintained. 
 
Soils, Water, and Air 
 
Roads are recognized a significant human-caused source of soil and water disturbances in 
forested environments, and water quality also affects the value or water-based recreation 
activities. Air quality affects human health as well as visibility and scenic quality. This section 
addresses potential effects of the alternatives on water, soil, and air resources, focusing on key 
differences in foreseeable activities under each rulemaking alternative. For details about the 
discussion below, see the physical resources section in chapter 3 of the RDEIS. 
 
 
Analysis of Alternatives: Soil 
 
Soil in the potentially affected CRAs is generally in satisfactory condition. There do not appear 
to be large acreages of excessive soil erosion, detrimental soil disturbance, or landslides 
attributed to management activities. Localized areas devoid of vegetation and subject to 
accelerated soil erosion occur on relatively small, scattered acreages where human activities have 
routinely occurred. At higher elevations the rate of soil formation is much slower than in the 
more temperate lower elevations. High-elevation soils are generally not as well-developed or as 
fertile as those occurring at lower elevations. 
 
Erosion hazard on most of the soils in the analysis area can be characterized as low to moderate, 
with the moderate rating being dominant. High erosion hazards are associated with soils on 
slopes greater than 40 percent. During project-level analysis, areas sensitive to surface erosion 
are identified and appropriate mitigation measures are used to reduce surface erosion and 
sediment production. Implementation of a well-prepared surface erosion and sediment control 
program in conjunction with road building and forestry activities can mitigate the potentially 
degrading impacts of surface erosion. 
 
The relative percentage of each erosion hazard class for soil types in the roadless areas (IRAs 
and CRAs) under all alternatives is 35 percent high, 50 percent moderate, and 15 percent is low. 
 
 2001 Rule 
 
The 2001 rule would have the least potential for accelerated rates of erosion in roadless areas 
because of the general prohibitions on roading and tree-cutting activities. 
                                                                                                                                                             
activities in adjacent roadless areas would not be expected to significantly detract from the values for which those 
areas were designated. 
 126 
 
 
There would be little risk of significant amounts of soil movement or loss of soil quality from 
increases in soil erosion or landslides. Roads would typically not be on steep slopes (over 40 
percent) because some areas are more prone to landslides on steep slopes. The likelihood would 
be low that project road construction would occur on highly sensitive soils and result in a 
substantial increase in soil erosion. Maintaining the restrictions on new road construction in the 
substantially altered areas would further help to maintain desirable soil conditions in the roadless 
areas, even though tree-cutting activities would continue to occur along existing roads in those 
areas.  
 
No major long-term impacts on soil resources would be anticipated to occur as a result of 
projected new development in ski areas. Unroaded areas outside IRAs would continue to incur 
the same soil effects that are currently occurring, and potential soil impacts may increase if roads 
are built in the future. The potential for post-fire erosion and other wildfire-related impacts on 
soil quality in roadless areas would remain high under this alternative.  
  
Other ongoing activities in roadless areas that would continue to affect soil resource conditions 
include: prescribed fire and wildfire use, some hard-rock mining, livestock grazing, recreational 
use, and many other ongoing activities. These activities are known to contribute to localized 
impacts on soil quality. However, these activities would not be measurably different under any of 
the alternatives. 
 
Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Rule, Alternative 2) 
 
Compared to the 2001 rule, the proposed rule would result in slightly higher risk of affecting the 
soil resource. Like the 2001 rule, changes in soil conditions would be limited to relatively small 
acreages, geographically scattered over millions of acres of roadless areas. Temporary roads and 
other disturbed areas would be revegetated after a project is completed. 
  
Similar to the 2001 rule, the soil resource in the roadless areas would remain in a functioning 
condition, with no significant loss of long-term soil productivity under the proposed rule. 
 
The new roads projected to be constructed under this alternative would cause a slightly higher 
increase in soil erosion and disturbance in roadless areas compared to the 2001 rule. While the 
roads remain in place, prior to decommissioning, there would be a temporary loss of soil 
productivity on those affected acres. Because nearly all the future roads in CRAs would be 
decommissioned, there would be very little permanent loss of soil productivity in the roadless 
areas. A temporary but longer-term loss of productivity would occur on roadless acres devoted to 
new oil, gas, and coal drilling pads and associated roads because the life of these commitments 
would be expected to continue for many decades. However, because of the mitigation measures 
anticipated to protect soil quality, the post-project rehabilitation of disturbed soils, and the 
localized nature of projected activities, the activities projected under the final rule that would 
differ from the 2001 rule would not be expected to result in significant increases in soil erosion 
rates that would reduce long-term soil productivity in the roadless areas. Modifications and 
clarifications regarding permissions for road construction and tree-cutting made to the proposed 
rule in developing the proposed rule provide additional assurances about soil protection. 
 127 
 
 
Overall, there would not be a significant reduction in long-term soil productivity in the roadless 
areas resulting from higher levels of tree-cutting activities or energy resource development 
activities in roadless areas.  
 
Projections of greater roading under the proposed rule would result in a slightly higher risk of 
road-related soil erosion compared to the 2001 rule, although those impacts would be mitigated 
to a large extent. The new roads in those substantially altered areas would be removed from soil 
productivity while they remain as roads, prior to decommissioning.  
 
Not including ski areas in the CRAs under the proposed rule would not be anticipated to result in 
more or less soil resource impacts on those ski area acres. Ground-disturbing activity projected 
to occur over the next 15 years in those ski areas would not significantly differ by alternative.  
 
The addition of 409,000 acres of unroaded areas into CRAs under this alternative would reduce 
the potential for road-related impacts on soil quality in those areas. The potential for wildfire-
related impacts on soil quality in roadless areas would be lower under the proposed rule 
compared to the 2001 rule. 
 
 Forest Plans (No Action, Alternative 3) 
 
The level of projected road construction, tree-cutting, and energy development activities under 
this alternative may result in higher risk to soil quality, compared to the 2001 rule and the 
proposed rule, however the overall soil resource impacts would not substantially differ from the 
other alternatives, and long-term soil productivity in IRAs would be expected to be maintained at 
a satisfactory level. Soil impacts would be minimized for the reasons previously described for 
the other alternatives.  
 
Like the other alternatives, the soil resources on a landscape scale in the roadless areas would 
remain in satisfactory condition under the forest plans alternative, with no significant loss of 
long-term soil productivity. However, there would be an increased risk of localized and short-
term soil impacts because there would be more acres of soil disturbance in this alternative.  
 
A higher risk of road-related soil erosion in substantially altered areas under the forest plans 
alternative compared to the 2001 rule, and would be essentially the same as impacts described 
below for the proposed rule.  Impacts on soil quality in ski areas in IRAs would be essentially the 
same as described for the other two alternatives.  
 
Soil quality impacts on the unroaded areas not included in IRAs under the forest plans alternative 
would be the same as described for the 2001 rule. Like the 2001 rule, there would be a higher 
potential for adverse soil quality impacts from future roading and other development activities in 
these unroaded areas.   
 
The potential for post-fire accelerated erosion and other wildfire-related impacts to soil quality in 
roadless areas would be slightly reduced under this alternative compared to the 2001 rule.   
 
 128 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
Alternative 4 would result in slightly higher risk than alternative 1 but less than alternatives 2 or 
3, of affecting the soil resource. The soil resource would remain in a functioning condition, with 
no significant loss of long-term soil productivity.  
 
The environmental consequences of this alternative are similar to alternative 2. The difference 
between the two alternatives is the extent of the upper tier acres within CRAs.  Because of over 2 
million additional upper acres, the forests project less tree-cutting and road construction than 
alternative 2. The potential for accelerated rates of erosion or landslides in roadless areas caused 
by tree-cutting activities and road construction, or reconstruction is less than alternative 2 but 
there is an increased risk of a high-severity wildfire event over alternative 2, which could 
increase post-fire soil erosion or landslides. 
 
Analysis of Alternatives: Water 
 
Colorado has approximately 95,500 miles of rivers and streams (Table 3-6), of which 12,800 
miles (13 percent) are listed in the 305(b) report as impaired stream miles as provided by the 
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (2008). Only 13 percent of the stream 
miles in Colorado are listed as impaired, and only 1 percent of those impaired stream miles occur 
in roadless areas (IRAs or CRAs). There are only 3,700 lake or reservoir acres on NFS lands in 
Colorado, or less than 1 percent of the 252,300 acres of lakes and reservoirs in Colorado, and a 
much smaller fraction of those occur in the roadless areas. Very few miles of streams (5,810 
miles) in roadless areas (IRAs or CRAs) are listed as impaired (150 to 155 miles). The most 
common sources of potential water quality impacts in the roadless areas are: roading, mining, 
oil-gas or coal development and operations, off-highway vehicle use, livestock grazing, 
dispersed camping, and activities related  to tree-cutting (such as log skidding), especially if 
these activities occur near streams or lakes. 
 
Despite the potential for water quality degradation from management activities in roadless areas, 
the streams and lakes in roadless areas in Colorado generally have good to excellent water 
quality, as previously described. This is partly because potential impacts from management 
activities on NFS lands are mitigated (avoided, reduced, or minimized) by following best 
management practices (BMPs) designed to control nonpoint sources of pollutants and meet 
Clean Water Act standards for water quality (FSM 2532). Water quality impacts are also 
mitigated through application of the Forest Service regional watershed conservation practices 
handbook (FSH 2509.25). 
 
Approximately 68 percent of the water yield in Colorado originates on NFS lands and much of 
this is from within the roadless and wilderness areas. More than 95 percent of the roadless areas 
(IRAs and CRAs) in Colorado overlap one or more source water assessment areas, which are 
watersheds, identified by the State around public surface and groundwater supply sources, 
according to Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and Source Water 
Protection databases. 
 
 129 
 
The wide-spread mountain pine beetle epidemic that is killing lodgepole pine and other pine 
species throughout Colorado is likely contributing to some temporary increases in water yield. 
Many roadless areas will continue to be affected by continued pine tree mortality, together with 
potential wildfires, resulting in future short-duration increases in water yield. 
 
Large, high-severity, stand-replacing wildfires are known to cause temporary increases in water 
yield and peak flows on NFS lands in Colorado. Short-duration, high-intensity rainstorms 
following a fire can produce high peak flows and flash floods that can change channel structures 
and adversely affect water quality because of high sediment loads. The risk of post-fire floods 
during summer convective storms is greatest in the first 2 or 3 years following the fire. 
 
All projects are subject to the NEPA process and site-specific analysis to determine appropriate 
mitigation measures. With the application of mitigation measures and BMPs to each project, the 
potential would be very low for exceeding water quality standards. Activities are unlikely to 
contribute to further impairment of streams currently listed on the state 303(d) list. 
 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
This alternative projects the least amount of tree-cutting or road construction over the next 15 
years of the four alternatives. It has the least risk of potential direct adverse effects on water 
quality from these activities. Maintaining the substantially altered areas within IRAs with the 
general prohibition on new roads would further help to maintain desirable soil and water quality 
conditions in the IRAs. Tree-cutting would continue to occur along existing roads in those areas, 
but it would not be expected to result in adverse impacts on water quality. On the 409,500 acres 
of unroaded area outside IRAs, there could be an increase in potential impacts on water quality 
from future land use activities that otherwise would be prohibited in IRAs.  
 
Alternative 1 projects the least amount of coal-drilling activity in roadless areas. It would have 
the lowest risk of accidental spills or other water quality impacts compared to the other three 
alternatives.  
 
Alternative 1 poses a slightly increased risk of experiencing a high-severity wildland fire because 
of the low amount of fuel reduction projected to occur in IRAs. The risk of indirect effects to 
water quality from flash floods and increased sedimentation in streams is increased. 
Implementing the BAER program (Burned Area Emergency Response) would reduce the risk to 
municipal water supplies and other critical values at risk.  
 
This alternative does not limit the use of linear construction zones. New water conveyance 
structures could be constructed or maintained using a linear construction zone. However, the lack 
of a road construction exception for this purpose could limit some new water conveyance 
structures from being located in IRAs. New water developments could occur in the 409,500 acres 
not in IRAs that are guided by Forest Plan direction. It is likely this alternative would have the 
least risk for water quality effects from construction of new water conveyance structures 
including reservoirs, or for changes in stream flow regimes due to new flow diversions or storage 
facilities of all the alternatives. 
 
 130 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action; Alternative 2) 
 
This alternative projects an increased level of both tree-cutting and road construction than 
alternatives 1 and 4, but less than 3. There is a slightly greater risk of direct adverse impacts on 
water quality in CRAs from these activities. Removing the substantially altered acres and adding 
the acres of unroaded into the CRAs, slightly decreases the amount of roadless acres in this 
alternative from the IRA acres in alternatives 1 and 3. There would be a slight increase in the 
potential for water quality impacts on those lands where ground disturbing activities could occur.  
 
Alternative 2 has increased projections for coal mining and associated new roads in the North 
Fork coal mining area and would increase the potential for adverse water quality impacts in those 
CRAs. There would be an increased risk of higher sediment, chemical contamination and 
accidental chemical spills in streams within the North Fork coal mining area. Mitigation 
measures and BMPs would reduce the likelihood of significant impacts from large sediment 
loads or accidental chemical spills. Remediation actions are applied if such accidents occur. The 
potential for significant adverse impacts from sediment and chemical inputs from increased coal 
activities would be expected to be negligible.  
 
The risk of a high-intensity wildland fire in a roadless area resulting in water quality impacts on 
a municipal water supply would be decreased under alternative 2 compared to alternatives 1 or 4. 
More acreage would be treated to abate wildland fire hazards in CRAs to protect at-risk 
communities and municipal water supply sources.  Implementing the BAER program would 
reduce the risk to municipal water supplies and other critical values at risk. 
 
This alternative includes both a road construction exception (other than in the upper tier acres) 
and a linear construction zone exception for new water conveyance structures authorized 
pursuant to water rights granted by a pre-existing water court decree. All of the water 
conveyance structures that have a pre-existing water court decree within CRAs could be 
constructed but future structures within CRAs will be extremely limited. Water quality effects, 
including changes in stream flow regimes, from the construction of new flow diversions, storage 
facilities (e.g. reservoirs) or water conveyance structures may be higher in this alternative than 
alternatives 1 or 4.  
 
 Forest Plans (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
Alternative 3 projects the highest level of tree-cutting and road construction than the other 
alternatives. There is a slightly greater risk of direct adverse impacts on water quality in CRAs 
from these activities. With effective mitigations, this alternative is not expected to cause water 
quality standards to be exceeded in the analysis area. 
 
Alternative 3 has the greatest amount of projected oil, gas and coal operations and therefore has 
the greatest potential risk of adverse effects on water quality from those activities. Site-specific 
mitigation measures and regulatory requirements would be expected to adequately protect water 
quality during these activities. However, the risk of accidental chemical spills or increased 
sediment or chemical levels in streams would be the highest under this alternative.  
 
 131 
 
Alternative 3 poses a decreased risk of experiencing a high-severity wildland fire because of the 
flexibility and level of fuel reduction projected to occur in the analysis area. As in the other 
alternatives, in the event that water quality for a municipal water supply is threatened by the 
effects of a high severity wildland fire, the BAER program would be implemented. 
 
Construction and maintenance of water conveyance structures would be guided by forest plan 
direction in alternative 3. In most of the analysis area, there is no restriction or limitation and the 
potential for new water conveyance structures is greatest in this alternative. The potential for 
risks to water quality or to changes in streamflow regime in the analysis area would be greatest 
in alternative 3. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier 
 
The environmental consequences of this alternative are similar to alternative 2. However, there 
are over 2 million more upper tier acres in this alternative.  Because of this, tree-cutting and road 
construction projections are less than alternative 2; reducing the risk of direct adverse impacts on 
water quality in CRAs.  
 
Coal mining development levels are the same as alternative 2. The risk of a high-intensity 
wildland fire in a roadless area resulting in water quality impacts on a municipal water supply is 
increased under Alternative 4 compared to Alternative 2 because of the smaller amount of 
projected fuel reduction treatments. Fewer water conveyance structures will be located within 
CRAs due to the lack of a road construction exception in the upper tier acres. A linear 
construction zone could be used on the upper tier acres. 
Analysis of Alternatives: Air 
The Forest Service coordinates with the State of Colorado to help prevent air quality impacts on 
Forest Service administered lands, in accordance with Clean Air Act, the Wilderness Act, and 
the Organic Act.  Of the airsheds that overlap parts of roadless areas in Colorado, no areas are 
currently designated as “non-attainment” for particulate matter. 
 
There are 11 class I areas within a 10-mile radius of roadless areas. Class I areas are typically 
large wilderness areas and other large congressionally designated areas. Most of the roadless 
areas lie adjacent to wilderness areas, many of which are class I areas. Class I areas must be 
managed to meet more stringent air quality levels compared to other areas. All class I areas 
however, have existing visibility impairment and do not meet the national visibility goal of 
having no anthropogenic (human) caused visibility impairment. 
 
 All Alternatives 
 
Differences in effects on air quality do not substantially differ among alternatives. Based on the 
projected land management activities that differ among alternatives, as described in the analysis 
framework, atmospheric emissions in roadless areas are not anticipated to directly, indirectly, or 
cumulatively increase to a level that would be likely to exceed State or Federal air quality 
standards. This estimate of potential impact is based on the estimated magnitude, extent, and 
duration of atmospheric emissions from those activities, as projected for each alternative. 
 
 132 
 
Alternative 3 allows for a higher level of oil and gas development than the other three 
alternatives, increasing the risk to air pollution.  Forest projections indicate a slight increase 
under this alternative; however, analysis will occur when a development proposal is received by 
the Forest Service as part of the NEPA analysis. 
 
The alternatives do not differ in the amount of prescribed burning that is allowed in roadless 
areas, so there would be little to no difference in effects from prescribed burning among 
alternatives. Prescribed burning in the roadless areas would continue to produce short-duration 
increases in particulates, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), organics, and hydrocarbons.  
 
The difference among alternatives is relatively minor in terms of the potential for smoke from 
large wildfires in roadless areas. Air quality impacts from dust emissions would be negligible 
and would not vary significantly by alternative.  
 
Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Species 
 
Details about information below about the occurrence of effects to threatened, endangered, 
proposed, candidate, and sensitive, as well as MIS in Colorado’s roadless areas are provided in 
detail in chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service 2010). 
 
Analysis of Alternatives: Botanical Resources 
 
This section focuses on the effects to threatened, endangered, and sensitive (TES) plants. For 
details about the following discussion, see section threatened, endangered, and sensitive plants in 
chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 
One threatened plant species is known to occur in CRAs: penland’s eutrema (Eutrema 
penlandii)17. Based on projections of foreseeable activities in roadless areas where this species 
exists (Hoosier Ridge, White River NF; Silver Heels, Pike San Isabel NF) under any alternative, 
there is no likely potential for oil, gas, or coal development, new roads, or tree-cutting activities 
in the penland’s eutrema habitat that occurs in roadless areas. 
 
Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance with section 7 of the ESA 
has been initiated and is ongoing for this proposed rule-making action. As part of the section 7 
process, the estimated effects on federally listed plants from the preferred alternative will 
subsequently be documented in a biological assessment and submitted for U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service concurrence, once a preferred alternative has been clearly identified (between the draft 
and final EIS). 
 
Forest Service sensitive species are those designated by a regional forester for which population 
viability is a concern. There are 44 sensitive plant species known or likely to occur in the 
roadless areas in Colorado. Inventories of sensitive plant species on NFS lands in Colorado are 
incomplete, especially in roadless areas. However, based on available information from the 
Colorado Natural Heritage Program and personnel on the NFs, approximately 31% of existing 
                                                 
17 Two other plants are listed under the ESA were thought to occur, but have since been shown not to occur in 
roadless areas (see Chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 133 
 
IRAs and 27% of CRAs are known or likely to support sensitive plants. New plants designated 
as sensitive during the next 15 years that are identified as occurring within roadless areas would 
likely be addressed during project-level analysis. 
 
Sixteen sensitive plant species that are known or likely to occur in IRAs or CRAs are considered 
endemic, because they occur only in Colorado. Endemic species may be at higher risk of 
extinction because of small population number and very limited geographic range. Two sensitive 
plants, one of which is endemic and a candidate for TE status under ESA, occur in portions of 
IRAs under Alternative 1 that are not included in CRAs under Alternative 2, while three 
sensitive species, one of which is endemic, occur in portions of CRAs that are not included in 
IRAs. 
 
Projects may also be designed to have beneficial effects on sensitive plant populations. For 
example, projects implemented for forest health, fuel reduction, or other purposes where 
management activities may occur in roadless areas could be designed to correct poor road 
alignments or existing soil erosion impacts on sensitive plants, or to reduce the risk of a high-
severity wildfire that might eliminate a sensitive plant population and its seed bank. Thus, some 
management actions in roadless areas could benefit sensitive plants over the long term, even if 
there are short-term adverse impacts. Of the 44 sensitive plant species known or likely to occur 
in roadless areas, five sensitive plant species (roughly 10 percent of the total sensitive plant 
species) grow in forest habitats that might benefit from tree-cutting to reduce the risk of severe 
stand-replacing wildfires. However, depending on where and how equipment is brought on-site 
for fuel reduction projects, there also could be increased risk of adverse impacts on sensitive 
plant species (for example, temporary road construction or skidder operations across shrublands 
or open areas). 
 
Forest Service Manual (FSM) direction requires that potential adverse impacts to sensitive 
species be avoided or minimized so as not to result in loss of viability or create trends toward 
federal listing. Under all alternatives, management actions such as roading or tree-cutting and 
removal typically include mitigation measures that adjust locations of these activities to avoid 
populations of sensitive plants. However, the manual direction also provides discretion to the 
line officer making the project-level decision to allow adverse impacts to sensitive species, 
provided that the decision does not result in loss of species viability or create significant trends 
toward Federal listing of the species under the ESA. 
 
Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities and events in roadless areas as well as 
surrounding lands of all ownerships can contribute to cumulative impacts to TES plant species. 
Fragmentation of T&E or sensitive plant species habitat can result from the combined effects of 
a wide array of ongoing, future, or past management actions in and around roadless areas. 
Habitat fragmentation effects can vary widely depending on a species’ breeding system, capacity 
for migration, and other factors. Habitat fragmentation can also affect plant populations through 
a loss of genetic diversity within populations. The relative risk of fragmentation to sensitive plant 
species is lower under Alternative 1 and 4 and somewhat higher for Alternatives 2 and 3. 
Climate change may also have a cumulative effect on the distribution of plants and other species. 
Some species will be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than others. Some of these 
changes are unlikely to occur to a measurable extent over the next 15 years, but other changes 
 134 
 
have already been documented. Changes in land use can challenge the ability of plants to adapt 
to climate change. The effects of these past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities or 
events would likely combine with the effects described below for each of the alternatives to raise 
the risk to T&E or sensitive plants. These adverse cumulative effects cannot be quantitatively 
described in this programmatic evaluation. 
 
The overall relative risks to T&E and sensitive plant species are summarized in Table 18 (as 
presented in Chapter 3 of the Revised DEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010); details about risks are 
presented below.

 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
As mentioned above, there would be no expected direct impacts on the threatened or endangered 
plant (Penland’s eutrema) from roading, tree-cutting and removal activities, or energy resource 
development activities in IRAs, because these activities are not projected to occur in the roadless 
areas where this plant occurs. There is some risk of indirect impacts on the TE plant from the 
spread of invasive plants that could increase as a result of activities on more distant roadless 
areas, however this risk is the lowest for Alternative 1 because of the tighter restrictions on road 
construction and tree-cutting. Continued management under Alternative 1 could benefit TE 
plants because of these activity restrictions within IRA boundaries. 
 
For sensitive plant species, various types of activities are projected to be likely under provisions 
of the 2001 Rule in some portion of 25 out of 101 IRAs where sensitive plants are known or 
likely to occur. Examples of these projections include road construction for oil and gas leases or 
access to private inholdings, as well as tree-cutting and removal to reduce wildfire hazards.   
Under Alternative 1 (the 2001 Rule), sensitive plants in the balance of the analysis area (outside 
of IRAs) would be managed under existing forest plans.  This would include 19 locations 
proposed for inclusion in CRAs under Alternative 2, seven of which have proposed activities 
(e.g., cutting trees, or road construction). The overall risk of adverse impacts on sensitive plants 
 135 
 
from projected activities in the analysis area would be lower under Alternative 1 compared to 
Alternatives 2 or 3, because of the lower number of management activities projected to occur in 
the IRAs that are known or likely to support sensitive plants. 
 
In general, the limitations on road construction and other activities under Alternative 1 would 
result in less risk of adverse effects to sensitive plants from invasive plants than would be 
expected under Alternatives 2 and 3. 
 
Under any alternative, there would be some level of risk of accidental damage to sensitive plants 
or their habitats during project implementation, or indirect impacts from increases in invasive 
plant populations. Those risks would be lowest under Alternative 1 because of the smaller 
number of roadless areas supporting sensitive plants where activities are projected to occur over 
the next 15 years, compared to Alternatives 2 or 3. 
 
There would be small potential beneficial effects on sensitive species from projected forest 
health and fuels treatment activities. However, treating approximately 800 acres per year in IRAs 
to maintain or restore characteristics of the ecosystem would not likely be of sufficient 
magnitude to have measureable effects. 
 
Overall, Alternative 1 may adversely affect individual sensitive plants but is not likely to result 
in a loss of viability for sensitive plant species, nor cause a trend toward federal listing for the 
sensitive species analyzed for this rule. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action, Alternative 2) 
 
Similar to Alternative 1, no activities (road construction, tree-cutting, or energy resource 
development) are projected to occur in roadless areas supporting the one TE plant species known 
or likely to occur in CRAs.  The only difference among alternatives would be a slightly higher 
risk of indirect effects from invasive plants that could spread from distant activity areas in other 
areas into threatened plant habitat within CRAs. This increased risk is due to the additional 
circumstances under which road construction and tree-cutting activities are allowed under 
Alternative 2, compared to Alternative 1. 
 
Based on activity projections in roadless areas, 34 of the 97  CRAs (35%) that are known or 
likely to support sensitive plants are projected to be likely to have road construction, tree-cutting, 
or energy resource development under provisions of the Colorado Roadless Rule, compared to 
25% of IRAs under Alternative 1. Sensitive plants in the balance of the analysis area (outside of 
CRAs) would be managed under existing forest plans.  This would include 15 areas which would 
no longer be managed as IRAs, 10 of which are projected to be likely to have activities like tree 
cutting and/or road construction over the next 15 years. Therefore, the risk of adverse impacts on 
sensitive plants would be higher under Alternative 2 than under Alternative 1. 
 
Under all alternatives, the Forest Service would try to avoid adverse impacts to sensitive plants 
during project implementation, or would apply appropriate mitigation measures. However, there 
would be a risk of unintended adverse impacts related to the level of projected activities in the 
CRAs known or likely to support sensitive plants.  
 136 
 
 
Indirect adverse impacts on sensitive plants from the expected spread of invasive non-native 
plants (noxious weeds) would be similar to the impacts described for Alternative 1. However, 
there would be a higher potential for such impacts under Alternative 2 due to the greater number 
of projected activities over the next 15 years in the CRAs where sensitive plants are known or 
likely to occur.   
 
Compared to Alternative 1, the projected fuels/forest health treatments in CRAs under 
Alternative 2 would have a better chance of reducing the potential for severe wildfires to 
eliminate a sensitive plant population and its seed bank. But, only about five of the 44 sensitive 
plant species in roadless areas (11%) occur in forests or similar habitats that would benefit from 
projected treatment activities. 
 
Overall, Alternative 2 may adversely affect individual sensitive plants but is not likely to result 
in a loss of viability for sensitive plant species or cause a trend toward federal listing for the 
sensitive plant species analyzed for this rule-making. 
 
 Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3, No Action) 
 
Similar to Alternatives 1 and 2, no activities (road construction, tree-cutting, or energy resource 
development) are projected to occur in roadless areas supporting the one TE plant species known 
or likely to occur in CRAs. However, Alternative 3 would result in a slightly higher risk of 
invasive plants affecting T&E plants due to a higher level of activities, compared to Alternative 
1, and the potential for their spread into areas supporting T&E plants. This risk would be 
approximately the same as described for Alternative 2. 
 
The effects on sensitive plants under Alternative 3 would be essentially the same as those 
described for Alternative 2, because under Alternative 3, one third of the analysis area is 
projected to include road construction, tree-cutting, or energy resource development activities 
under forest plans over the next 15 years. 
  
The potential for indirect effects from invasive plants would be similar to Alternative 2, because 
the level of activity in roadless areas where sensitive plants occur would be roughly the same 
under both alternatives. The risk is higher than under Alternative 1. 
 
The potential for beneficial effects to sensitive plants would be the same as described for 
Alternative 2 and would affect only a small percentage of the habitats where sensitive plants are 
known or likely to occur in roadless areas. Most sensitive plants in IRAs do not occur in habitats 
where tree cutting would reduce wildfire hazard. 
 
Overall, Alternative 3 may adversely affect individual sensitive plants but is not likely to result 
in a loss of viability for sensitive plant species or cause a trend toward federal listing for the 
sensitive plant species analyzed for this rule-making. In terms of relative risk, the risk of adverse 
impacts on sensitive plants would be higher under Alternatives 2 and 3 compared to Alternative 
1 primarily because of: (a) the higher likelihood of invasive plants spreading into sensitive plant 
communities, and (b) the higher likelihood of inadvertent mistakes that may be made during 
 137 
 
implementation of a larger number of projects. These differences in risk are correlated with the 
differences in the amount of projected activities in roadless areas that support sensitive plants. 
 
Colorado Roadless Rule with Proposed Public Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
No projected activities occur in any CRA where federally listed or proposed plants occur under 
this alternative. As discussed in the Environmental Consequences section for all alternatives, 
there is some risk of indirect impacts on federally listed plants from the spread of invasive non-
native plants. The risk is the higher than alternative 1 but lower than alternatives 2 or 3 because 
of the projected activities. Continued management under alternative 4 could benefit threatened or 
proposed plants because it restricts or limits new road construction, linear construction zones and 
other management activities within CRAs in general as well as on the upper tier acres. 
 
The risk to sensitive plants would be lower under alternative 4 than alternatives 2 or 3 but greater 
than alternative 1. Due to the greater number of upper tier acres under this alternative than 
alternative 2, there are less projected activities. Sensitive plants in the balance of the analysis 
area (outside of CRAs) would be managed under existing forest plans.  This would include 15 
areas which would no longer be managed as IRAs, more than half of which are projected to have 
activities like tree cutting and/or road construction over the next 15 years. 
 
Indirect adverse impacts on sensitive plants from the expected spread of invasive non-native 
plants would be similar to the impacts described for alternative 1. However, there would be a 
higher potential for such impacts under alternative 4 due to the greater number of projected 
activities over the next 15 years in the CRAs where sensitive plants are known or likely to occur. 
 
Compared to alternative 1, the projected treatments in CRAs under alternative 4 would have a 
better chance of reducing the potential for extremely hot wildfires to eliminate a sensitive plant 
population and its seed bank. However, only about five of the 43 sensitive plant species in 
roadless areas occur in forests or similar habitats that would benefit from projected activities 
intended to reduce the risk of severe wildfires. The great majority of sensitive plant species in 
roadless areas would not benefit from projected activities intended to reduce fire hazards. 
 
Overall, alternative 4 may adversely affect individual sensitive plants but is not likely to result in 
a loss of viability for sensitive plant species on any national forest in Colorado or cause a trend 
toward federal listing for the sensitive plant species analyzed in this document.  The 
programmatic biological evaluation in the EIS record will contain additional details about the 
potential effects to sensitive species, in accordance with policy requirements in FSM 2670.32. 
 
Analysis of Alternatives: Aquatic Habitat and Species 
 
This section addresses the activities that are identified as part of the roadless rule alternatives for 
Colorado and associated risks. Specific activities, including vegetation management; road 
construction; oil, gas and mineral development; and ski area development have been identified as 
possibly affecting aquatic habitat and associated biota between alternatives.  For details 
regarding the discussion below, see Aquatic Habitat and Species section in chapter 3 of the 
RDEIS. 
 138 
 
 
One threatened or endangered (T&E) fish species (greenback cutthroat trout) is known or likely 
to occur in any of the roadless areas and is known to occur on two of the NFs in Colorado: (1) 
Pike and San Isabel, and (2) Arapaho and Roosevelt NFs. There are no fish species identified as 
proposed under ESA, nor any designated critical habitat for T&E fish, in Colorado.   
 
Where there are more roadless area acres in close proximity to large population centers in 
Colorado, such as on the Arapaho and Roosevelt or Pike and San Isabel NFs, there is a higher 
potential for cumulative impacts to aquatic species and habitat. Various land use activities where 
they occur in the same vicinity may cumulatively limit the potential for reestablishment of 
greenback cutthroat trout on these two NFs. 
 
Forest Service sensitive species are species identified by a regional forester for which population 
viability is a concern, as evidenced by significant current or predicted downward trends in 
population numbers or density, or in habitat capability that would reduce a species’ existing 
distribution (FSM 2670.5). There are five sensitive fish species that occur or are likely to occur 
in roadless areas:  two trout species (Rio Grande cutthroat trout in addition to the threatened 
greenback cutthroat trout) and three sucker species (flannelmouth, bluehead, and mountain 
suckers).  Through a variety of human influences, including stocking of non-native trout and 
habitat fragmentation and reduction, the trout populations are primarily limited to areas such as 
wilderness, roadless, national parks, and other relatively remote areas of the State.  All three of 
the suckers are apparently being out-competed by more common western white suckers 
(Catostomus commersoni) and longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus) that have been 
introduced west of the Continental Divide. While the exact mechanism for this replacement is 
only beginning to be understood, it appears that competition, hybridization, habitat fragmentation 
and stocking have contributed to this problem. 
 
There are four T&E fish species (razorback sucker, bonytail chub, Colorado pike minnow, and 
humpback chub)  that occur downstream of NFS lands in the Colorado River and some of its 
larger tributaries that could be indirectly affected by activities in the roadless areas. These 
residents of relatively large river systems have become increasingly rare, mostly due to dramatic 
changes in hydrology, water quality, and habitat conditions. Although these fish do not occur in 
rivers in Colorado, they could be affected by the combination of different activities that are likely 
to occur in the roadless areas that affect their habitat conditions. 
 
There are aquatic habitats in many of the roadless areas in Colorado that have been identified as 
being ecologically important as well as “rare.” Fens act as carbon sinks, are typically produced at 
the toes of slopes, and are often associated with high elevation glaciated valleys. Wetlands are 
also an important habitat for many species and have been reduced in Colorado by as much as 50 
percent of their historic extent, through numerous management activities. In some areas in 
Colorado, conversion of riparian forest and shrub dominated ecosystems to unvegetated and 
grass dominated habitat has resulted in a loss of important habitat for a variety of plants and 
animals. 
 
Management Indicator Species (MIS) are species identified in land management plans for each 
NF, as indicators of the effects of management activities on specific habitat types or features, as 
 139 
 
a means of compliance with the NFMA. There are 36 MIS animal species (terrestrial and 
aquatic) represented for the NFs in Colorado excluding those selected for national grassland 
ecosystems: 11 mammals, 23 birds, 1 amphibian (toad), and 1 invertebrate (insect). All 36 MIS 
are likely to occur in one or more roadless area, and therefore are relevant to this analysis. 
Aquatic MIS identified in Forest plans in Colorado include: six specific species of fish (trout), 
one mammal (American beaver), and the array of benthic (bottom-dwelling) macro invertebrates 
(such as insects, mollusks, or crayfish). 
 
For all alternatives, Forest Service authorized roading (as well as the projected tree-cutting 
activities) would be designed to avoid or mitigate direct impacts to aquatic habitat and species. 
Thus, the main threat to T&E species, sensitive species, and MIS would be from the potential 
increase in invasive species associated with the new roads and other activities projected to occur 
under this alternative. 
 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
The roading and tree-cutting restrictions under the 2001 rule would be expected to adequately 
protect the roadless area characteristics and the T&E species, sensitive species, and MIS found in 
the IRAs. The potential for impacts to aquatic species and habitat in IRAs would be less than for 
the other alternatives. The majority of the IRAs would continue to provide adequate protection 
for aquatic ecosystems and the species that inhabit them. The 2001 rule would be expected to 
have no adverse impacts on TES species in roadless areas or downstream from roadless areas. 
Additionally, there would be no adverse impact on MIS, or the wetlands and other aquatic 
habitat characteristics. 
This alternative does not include 409,500 acres of unroaded lands that are outside IRAs, which 
would be managed according to forest plan direction. The biggest potential effect of not 
including those acres in IRAs that are in the CRAs would be to the wetlands and fens that may 
be affected by increased human activity on those acres. 
The relatively high percentage of roadless areas with T&E or sensitive species within the AR, 
GMUG, Routt, SJ, and WR National Forests suggests that these areas are “strongholds” for 
native populations and/or native trout reintroduction/improvement areas. The 2001 Rule is 
expected to have no adverse effects on T&E and sensitive species, MIS, downstream T&E, 
wetlands and fens, riparian areas, or the use of roadless areas for future native fish species 
recovery in roadless areas across all National Forests in Colorado. Under Alternative 1, as well 
as the other alternatives, appropriate mitigation measures and best management practices would 
help avoid or minimize impacts from the activities permitted in roadless areas. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Alternative 2, Proposed Action) 
The primary difference between this alternative and the 2001 rule is related to the amount of new 
roads allowed and projected to occur in the roadless areas, as well as in the differences in the 
CRA boundaries compared to IRA boundaries. In the substantially altered and other IRA acres 
outside the CRAs (467,100 acres), there would be a greater potential for impacts to aquatic 
habitat and species compared to the 2001 rule. However, this alternative includes unroaded 
acreage in CRAs (409,500 acres) that is outside IRAs, which would afford greater protection 
from potential impacts from new roads in those additional CRA acreages. Another significant 
 140 
 
difference is that Alternative 2 requires that any road or linear construction zone (LCZ) 
construction must maintain or improve existing native cutthroat trout habitat; Alternative 2 
therefore provides greater protection for cutthroat trout compared to Alternatives 1 and 3. Similar 
to Alternative 1 (and 3), the primary risk is associated with potential increases in invasive 
species. 
The risks of impacts to individual fish populations and wetlands/fens are predicted to be greater 
in the roadless areas where oil, gas, and coal development activities and/or tree-cutting are 
projected to increase under the Alternative 2 compared to Alternative 1, but decrease relative to 
No Action (Alternative 3), particularly in roadless areas on the GMUG, as well as the San Juan 
and White River National Forests. Tree-cutting is projected for many roadless areas within the 
Pike/San Isabel NF, but mitigation measures are expected to be adequate to protect aquatic 
species. The additions of new unroaded areas to CRAs may offer increased protection for aquatic 
habitat in those areas, but mitigation strategies may not be adequate to protect sensitive species 
in some substantially altered areas on some forests (e.g., San Juan). 
The increases in activities projected in CRAs and substantially altered areas (removed from 
roadless area protections under the rule) would be expected to increase risks to individual fish 
populations but would not likely result in measurable declines in overall population trends on 
any NF for any of the aquatic TES species or MIS. The unroaded acres added to CRAs that are 
not in IRAs would provide more protection of aquatic habitat compared to the 2001 rule and the 
forest plans alternative for those acres, due to the limitations on roads and tree-cutting in those 
areas. 
Some of the IRA acres that are not included in CRAs (i.e., substantially altered areas) under 
Alternative 2 may have more new roads and associated management activities approved by 
responsible officials under the governing forest plans. The IRA acres and stream miles that are 
not included in CRAs are greatest on the GMUG NF administrative unit. Across all forest units, 
there would be 19 fewer stream miles in CRAs, compared to IRAs under Alternative 1. The 
biggest potential impact in substantially altered areas as a result of increased human activity 
might be to wetlands and fens. 
Compared to the 2001 rule, where projected activities increase for this alternative and T&E or 
sensitive species occur, there would be an increased risk of negative impacts. The roadless areas 
on the GMUG, San Juan, and White River NFs are where the risk may be highest due to the 
increases in roads to support additional oil, gas, and coal development activities, in addition to 
other fuels or forest health projects projected in those same affected areas under Alternative 2 
compared to Alternative 1; risks are expected to be lower relative to Alternative 3. 
 
The MIS or sensitive species population viability would not be significantly affected on any of 
the NFs, assuming that appropriate mitigation and BMPs would be applied at the project level.  
 
Overall, population trends would not be negatively affected, although there would be impacts in 
roadless areas where invasive species are introduced, human activity are increased, or 
inadvertent accidental damage to aquatic habitat occurred as a result of management activities 
The increasing potential for adverse impacts associated with Alternatives 2 and 3 respectively 
would add to the existing cumulative impacts from all the other land use activities discussed. 
While these alternatives would not individually result in highly significant adverse impacts, they 
 141 
 
would contribute negatively to cumulative effects in these aquatic ecosystems in the roadless 
areas. 
Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3, No Action) 
The general effects of the projected roading, tree-cutting and road-related oil, gas, and coal 
development activities under existing land management plans would be similar to those 
described for Alternative 2. However, the extent of those projected activities in roadless areas 
would be greatest under this alternative. Thus, this alternative poses the greatest risk of impact to 
aquatic species and habitat. There are relatively more roadless areas with projected activities and 
T&E and sensitive species on some forests (e.g.,  Pike San Isabel, San Juan, and White River), 
implying an increased risk of adverse impacts on individual populations as well as habitat, 
wetlands, and riparian areas in this forest compared to Alternatives 1, 2, and 4. 
 
One beneficial effect of this alternative would be associated with the increased amount of fuel 
reduction treatment acres in IRAs, which could reduce wildfire severity in the roadless areas 
resulting in beneficial effects on aquatic habitat and species.  
 
Overall, this alternative would result in reduced “resiliency” and population fitness of some MIS 
species, potentially impact populations of aquatic T&E and sensitive species, and further reduce 
wetland and riparian abundance and health. This alternative could potentially create more impact 
to aquatic species and ecosystems compared to the other two alternatives, as the forest plans 
alternative is generally less restrictive on more acres of IRAs/CRAs, and there are more 
projected activities under this alternative. 
Though there is a higher risk than other alternatives for impacts on individual threatened species 
habitat, wetlands, and riparian areas, there is no long-term adverse effect on T&E species, 
sensitive species, and MIS population trends; downstream T&E species; or wetlands and riparian 
areas. This assumption presumes that appropriate mitigation measures and best management 
practices would help avoid or minimize impacts from the activities allowed to occur under 
alternative 3. The specialist report in the EIS record contains further details for each national 
forest and specific roadless areas. 
 
Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
Alternative 4 contains identical prohibitions and exceptions as alternative 2; however, there are 
more acres identified as Colorado Roadless Area upper tier acres.  A portion of these upper tier 
acres have been identified as being within watersheds that are currently occupied by T&E, 
sensitive, and MIS fish.  For this reason, there is more protection in alternative 4 than alternative 
2.   In addition, these additional acres contain stream riparian and wetland acres not included in 
the other alternatives.  In these areas, alternative 4 will provide additional restrictions on 
management activities thereby reducing the risks described above that are associated with tree 
cutting, sale or removal or road construction and reconstruction below those risks for alternative 
1.   
On all of the national forests, there is no adverse effect on the T&E, sensitive species and MIS 
that occur there or on T&E species downstream. There is no adverse effect on fens, other 
wetlands or riparian areas. This assumption presumes that appropriate mitigation measures and 
 142 
 
best management practices would help avoid or minimize impacts from the activities allowed to 
occur in roadless areas under alternative 4. 
 
Analysis of Alternative: Wildlife 
This section evaluates effects of the alternatives on terrestrial (land-based) animal habitats and 
species including birds and invertebrates. For details about the discussion below, see the 
terrestrial habitat and species section in chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
Roadless areas provide large, relatively undisturbed blocks of important habitats for terrestrial 
animal species and communities. Because roadless areas are usually more than 5,000 acres in 
size, often border wilderness areas, and are largely unroaded and undeveloped, they typically 
provide travel corridors, habitat connectivity, habitat diversity/complexity, seclusion for 
reproduction, island of refugia, and viability assurances given loss of habitat in adjacent lands.  
 
Roadless area characteristics and values relevant to terrestrial species and habitats include the 
following:  
 
 A diversity of native and desired non-native plant and animal communities, due to the 
absence of disturbances caused by roads and accompanying activities. 
 Conservation of native biodiversity by serving as a bulwark against the spread of non-
native invasive species. 
 Habitats for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate, Forest Service sensitive 
species, and Colorado priority species, and for species dependent on large, undisturbed 
areas of land. 
 Biological strongholds and refuges for many species, including terrestrial and aquatic 
plant and animal species. 
 
Roadless areas in Colorado are composed predominantly of coniferous forests in mountainous 
terrain (7,000 to 14,000 feet). Habitat structural types range from early through late successional 
stages, dominated by coniferous forest. Most roadless areas provide high-quality late-
successional habitat, supporting a rich array of species that depend on the abundance of snags 
and down logs, large trees, and dense canopy cover. Virtually all the roadless areas (except two 
or three) have a threatened, endangered, or sensitive species or habitat in them, based on known 
species occurrences and habitat requirements. 
There are six federally listed threatened or endangered (T&E) terrestrial animal species known or 
likely to occur in the analysis area. Critical habitat has been designated by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service for two of the potentially affected T&E species: Preble’s meadow jumping 
mouse and Mexican spotted owl in two National Forests. Four roadless areas on the Arapaho and 
Roosevelt NFs and two roadless areas on the Pike and San Isabel NFs have critical habitat for the 
preble’s mouse. Nine roadless areas on the Pike and San Isabel NFs have critical habitat for 
Mexican spotted owl. There are no species proposed for listing that occur in Colorado, and two 
species are identified as candidates for listing and are included in the list of ‘sensitive’ species. 
There are 34 sensitive animal species that occur or are likely to occur in roadless areas. These 
consist of 19 birds, 10 mammals, 3 amphibians, and 2 invertebrate (insect) (see the terrestrial 
habitat and species section in chapter 3 of the RDEIS for list of species and habitat 
 143 
 
requirements). Inventories of sensitive species on NFS lands are incomplete, especially in 
roadless areas.  
There are 36 terrestrial MIS animal species represented for the NFs in Colorado excluding those 
selected for national grassland ecosystems: 23 birds, 11 mammals, 1 amphibian (toad), and 1 
invertebrate (insect). All 36 MIS are likely to occur in at least one roadless area and therefore are 
relevant to this analysis. Four MIS are also identified as T&E species. 
Of the 53 important bird areas (IBAs) (defined by National Audubon Society) designated in 
Colorado, two are in roadless areas or their adjacent wilderness areas on the White River NF: 
Hanging Lake IBA (in Grizzly Creek IRA), and Alfred M. Bailey Bird Nesting Area IBA (in 
Eagles Nest Wilderness adjacent to the Maryland Creek Roadless Area). Potential threats to the 
Hanging Lake IBA are habitat disturbance from recreational rock and ice climbers. The Alfred 
M. Bailey Bird Nesting Area IBA was so-designated because it is one of the most diverse 
mountain bird breeding sites in Colorado, with approximately 44 species of breeding birds 
identified. Audubon has identified potential threats to this IBA as habitat conversion of the 
surrounding forest by logging. 
Roadless areas provide important habitats for wild ungulates (elk, deer, bighorn sheep, mountain 
goats), and black bear and mountain lion. Deer fawning and/or elk calving habitat has been 
documented to occur within more than 40 percent of IRAs in the state, and about one-third 
contain seasonal migration corridors for big game animals. 
 All Alternatives 
The discussions in this section focus on the potential for adverse effects from roads and other 
management activities that differ by alternative. Those potential adverse effects are expected to 
be either avoided or minimized during project planning and implementation through compliance 
with standards and guidelines in land management plans and other applicable laws, regulations, 
and agency policy.  
Each new undertaking on NFS lands requires evaluation of effects on T&E and sensitive species, 
MIS, and migratory bird species.  Appropriate conservation measures must be considered in the 
decisionmaking process. The actual extent of effects would be based on site-specific factors such 
as location, timing, duration, frequency, and magnitude of the ground-disturbing activities. 
Road construction and road use can affect habitat availability. Construction and reconstruction of 
roads can contribute to an immediate loss of habitat by removing existing vegetation and altering 
the substrate. Because forest roads, especially in roadless areas, tend to be narrow 
(approximately 12 to 14 ft. wide), their contribution to habitat loss on a landscape scale may 
appear minimal. However, the total extent of the landscape that is roaded has consequences for 
habitat availability. The higher road densities that exist outside roadless and wilderness areas 
increase the role of roadless areas and wilderness as refugia for terrestrial animal species.  
The indirect effects of road construction and use include noise and visual disturbance that can 
displace wildlife by causing them to avoid suitable habitats that would otherwise be available to 
them.  The reduction in habitat effectiveness can be substantial; even a limited amount of 
administrative traffic behind closed gates is sufficient to reinforce the avoidance behavior. 
The effects of roads, tree-cutting, and minerals/energy activity on animal habitats can be 
organized into the following categories: habitat availability and effectiveness; habitat 
fragmentation; invasive species; and human caused disturbance and mortality. These categories 
 144 
 
are not mutually exclusive as they represent many interrelated effects. Beneficial effects on 
terrestrial species from tree-cutting and associated activities are derived from projects where the 
primary objective considers creating or maintaining some specific habitat condition (e.g., age-
class diversity, ecosystem condition improvement, reduced risk of large stand-replacing insect 
and disease outbreaks, and severe wildfire). 
The effects from all alternatives may combine with effects from other activities or land uses in or 
adjacent to roadless areas to result in a cumulative effect. Considering the population growth rate 
of the State and the high demand for resources available in Colorado, some non-Federal lands 
will continue to experience impacts on natural resources from urbanization and development, 
resource demands (for example, minerals), and recreation. Some effects that result in lower 
habitat quality on non-Federal land may limit the potential effectiveness of habitat conservation 
and restoration on Federal lands. Development of non-Federal lands displaces mobile animals to 
adjacent NFS lands. Other events that may contribute to cumulative effects include climate 
change and increases in energy demand. 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
The 2001 rule would provide the highest level of protection to T&E species, sensitive species, 
MIS, and migratory bird species, compared to the other alternatives, due in large part to lower 
levels of permitted and projected activity in roadless areas. Areas with low road densities, less 
altered or modified forest vegetation, and lower levels of human activity and ground disturbance 
are generally better for wildlife species and habitat conditions. Limitation of tree-cutting to 
“generally small-diameter trees” under Alternative 1 would help maintain larger trees and would 
provide for more variability in forest structure. The limitations on the type and extent of tree-
cutting under this alternative would make it unlikely that tree-cutting would measurably increase 
habitat fragmentation, reduce habitat connectivity, or otherwise adversely affect habitat 
effectiveness for wildlife. Potential detrimental effects would be less likely to involve 
measurable adverse impacts on any of the potentially affected species. 
Substantially altered portions of IRAs would continue to experience higher levels of roads, tree-
cutting, and human activity than the other portions. Over time, some of the existing roads might 
be decommissioned, but those that access private lands or infrastructure under special use permit 
would likely remain. 
New road construction within roadless areas would be very limited, primarily related to oil and 
gas operations under existing leases. Tree-cutting would also occur only under very limited 
circumstances, primarily to reduce wildfire hazard.  Tree-cutting would primarily focus on 
protecting human communities, but could be used as a tool to enhance habitat for T&E or 
sensitive species, where ecological restoration is needed. 
Overall for T&E species, based on the very protective guidance that would apply to the 
inventoried roadless areas, and the low level and intensity of road construction, tree cutting, and 
oil and gas development under this alternative, the anticipated effects are mostly beneficial, with 
the potential for minor, local adverse effects to the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Mexican 
spotted owl, Pawnee montane skipper, Canada lynx, and Preble’s meadow jumping mouse, and 
to designated critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl and Preble’s meadow jumping mouse. 
Effects are expected to be wholly beneficial for the Uncompahgre fritillary, because of the higher 
degree of certainty of protection of its habitat under this alternative and the lack of any impacts 
anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
 145 
 
For sensitive species, because of the limited amount of road construction anticipated under this 
alternative, the probability of adverse effects is low or minimal for species associated with 
wetland, stream, lake, waterfalls, subalpine conifer forest (including ptarmigan), aspen (purple 
martin), cave/cliff/talus/canyonland, grassland, meadow, and sagebrush habitats. Adverse effects 
are also unlikely for lower elevation coniferous forest species (e.g., flammulated owl, northern 
goshawk), but treatment of fuels and emphasis on removal of small diameter rather than large 
diameter trees could be beneficial for maintaining habitat for these species over time. 
This alternative could result in some positive changes in the projected population trends of MIS, 
and in no case would reduce the probability of maintaining viable populations of any species.  
Due to the lower level of development in IRAs, fewer adverse impacts on habitat or species 
would be expected as compared with the other alternatives. 
The 2001 rule would also not likely affect the Forest Service’s ability to adhere to requirements 
under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 or the executive order for protection of migratory 
birds. 
In general, the road construction and tree-cutting allowed under the exceptions could potentially 
have detrimental effects. However, the magnitude of this effect likely would be small, since it 
would be limited to small portions of roadless areas. The actual effects on wildlife would depend 
on the location, timing, duration, and frequency of the ground-disturbing activities, which would 
be designed and conducted in accordance with direction in forest plans. It is estimated that the 
2001 rule may affect individuals but is not likely to adversely affect populations of any of the 
T&E species identified as known or likely to occur in the roadless areas. The 2001 rule may 
adversely affect individual sensitive species but is not likely to result in a loss of viability or 
cause a trend toward Federal listing for the sensitive species populations on any of the NFs. 
There are not likely to be any significant changes in population trends for MIS because of the 
highly protective nature of the 2001 rule. 
Alternative 1, when combined with other cumulative effects, would be beneficial to maintenance 
of biological diversity, including species habitats, populations, and landscape diversity. 
Conservation of roadless areas will be increasingly important with the growing population and 
pressures on the land in Colorado. 
 Colorado Roadless Rule (Alternative 2, Proposed Action) 
By continuing to limit human activities in CRAs through general prohibitions and limitations, 
this alternative would help maintain important protections for T&E species, sensitive species, 
MIS, and migratory birds and their habitats. 
 
Under this alternative, most roads within CRAs are temporary, used only for the permitted 
activity, and decommissioned immediately after completion of the activity.  However, temporary 
roads would be available to foot traffic, bicycles, horseback riding, etc. which can have negative 
effects on wildlife. In addition, unauthorized use of closed or restricted roads has historically 
been difficult to control and enforce. Consequently, an assumption of minimal impacts from 
temporary roads may not always hold true. 
 
The increased ability to treat acres for forest health and fuels management under Alternative 2 
could improve habitats for species that inhabit early seral stages and lower elevation forests with 
frequent low-intensity fire regimes. Removal of diseased, dead, and down materials could have 
 146 
 
negative impacts on primary cavity nesters, although Forest Plan requirements for retention of 
snags and down logs would help limit negative effects. 
 
This alternative adjusts the CRA boundaries to remove existing roadless acres that fall within 
current ski area permit boundaries or Forest Plan Management Areas that have ski area 
emphasis. Three areas are of particular concern for wildlife habitat connectivity: Williams Fork 
Ptarmigan Adjacent (Loveland ski area on Arapaho-Roosevelt NF) serving as a land bridge for 
large carnivores and other species, Game Creek (Vail ski area on White River NF) serving as a 
corridor or linkage area for lynx, deer, and elk, and Porcupine Creek (Arapaho Basin ski area on 
White River NF) serving as a lynx linkage and critical movement areas between Arapahoe Basin 
and Keystone Ski area. Any future development within these areas will be subject to project-
level analysis that will carefully consider impacts on habitat connectivity. 
 
For T&E species, as described for Alternative 1, the Pawnee montane skipper and Mexican 
spotted owl could benefit from fuels treatments that restored more natural conditions. Temporary 
road construction and energy development could remove some habitat and cause displacement, 
although site-specific analysis and design would likely reduce those potential impacts. Under this 
alternative, some of the lands adjacent to ski areas that are within landscape linkages for the 
Canada lynx, where the Forest Plan would allow further ski area development, are exempted 
from the roadless prohibitions that would otherwise apply. As compared to Alternative 1, this 
elevates the risk to lynx. However, in accordance with the Southern Rockies Lynx Amendment 
decision, any projects would have to be designed in a way that maintains habitat connectivity. 
It is anticipated that fuels treatments and associated temporary road construction would occur in 
many of the CRAs that contain Preble’s meadow jumping mouse habitat. Overall, the level of 
protection for roadless areas under the Colorado rule is higher than under current Forest Plan 
direction, with a generally low level and intensity of road construction, tree cutting, oil and gas 
development, and ski area development.  The anticipated effects are mostly beneficial, with the 
potential for some minor impacts to the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Mexican spotted owl, 
Pawnee montane skipper, Canada lynx, and Preble’s meadow jumping mouse, and to designated 
critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl and Preble’s meadow jumping mouse. Effects are 
expected to be wholly beneficial for the Uncompahgre fritillary, because of the higher degree of 
certainty of protection of its habitat under this alternative and the lack of any impacts anticipated 
in the foreseeable future. 
 
The effects to sensitive species are similar to those described previously for Alternative 1, 
although the exceptions allow higher levels of road construction and tree cutting in areas 
surrounding cities and towns, for energy development, and adjoining certain ski areas. Road 
construction would have the greatest potential to have negative effects on seven sensitive species 
associated with wetland, stream, lake and waterfall habitats. Because of the limited 
circumstances under which roads could be constructed, the potential for adverse impacts is low. 
As described for Alternative 1, fuels treatments within lower elevation conifer forests could have 
long-term benefits to five sensitive bird species. There is low risk of adverse effects associated 
with subalpine forests (e.g., boreal owl, American marten), however, there could be local 
impacts on these species from increasing edge effects, fragmentation and invasive species. There 
is potential for additional oil and gas development to occur, which could have local adverse 
effects on purple martin if the activities occur in its aspen habitat. Most fuels treatments would 
 147 
 
occur at lower elevations, but ski area expansion and oil and gas development could cause some 
additional impacts to white-tailed ptarmigan, although at a generally low level under this 
alternative. Only minor disturbances to sensitive species associated with cliffs/caves/canyons, 
grasslands, meadows, and shrublands would be expected. 
 
Given the large acreage afforded roadless protection under this alternative, any changes in 
population trends for MIS would likely be an increase above current Forest Plan projections. 
Some adverse habitat modifications or species impacts could occur from the exceptions allowing 
temporary roads, tree-cutting activities, and energy resource exploration and development, as 
described previously. 
 
Overall, there would be no increased risk to IBAs in roadless areas, and the Forest Service’s 
ability to adhere to requirements under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the executive order for 
protection of migratory birds would not be affected. 
 
Alternative 2, with its exceptions development and treatment activities, when combined with 
other cumulative effects would be less beneficial to biological diversity, including species 
habitats, populations, and landscape diversity, than Alternative 1. However, designating 
approximately 4.2 million acres of roadless area will represent a net benefit to T&E species, 
sensitive species, and other terrestrial wildlife.  
Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3, No Action) 
 
The higher levels of road construction and vegetation management under Alternative 3 would 
allow direct habitat reduction and disturbance and fragmentation that would negatively affect 
terrestrial species. The specific location and design of these activities would influence the actual 
effects and would be addressed at the project level. 
 
In contrast to the other alternatives, the roads allowed under Alternative 3 may be permanent 
roads.  However, based on recent trends on NFS lands in Colorado, it is likely that many of the 
roads would be temporary and closed to public motorized use, and would be decommissioned 
after completion of the activity under Alternative 3.  The increased mileage of road construction 
would facilitate recreation uses such as hiking, biking, and horseback riding in the backcountry. 
This could increase impacts related to human disturbance to terrestrial species and habitat as 
described in the general effects discussion. 
 
The increased flexibility to treat fuels under this alternative would improve habitats for early 
seral species in some areas and in the short term. The projected treatments would be expected to 
reduce the potential for an uncharacteristically severe wildfire. Reducing fuel loading and 
wildland fire hazard in beetle-killed stands in areas of high importance to T&E and sensitive 
species could be beneficial because of the reduced fire severity expected. 
 
The amount of road construction associated with energy resource exploration and development is 
predicted to be higher under Alternative 3 than the other alternatives. In the long term, 
Alternative 3 would allow the most impact on IRAs or CRAs as a result of energy development.   
 
 148 
 
Alternative 3 would likely have effects similar to Alternative 2 on lynx habitat connectivity, deer 
migration corridors, elk winter range, and other habitats of concern in those areas. Project 
planning and design would consider maintaining the integrity of wildlife habitats and movement 
corridors. The higher level of anticipated road construction, vegetation management and other 
activities under Alternative 3 could lead to higher impacts on key wildlife habitats. However, the 
current Forest Plans were designed to ensure that viable populations of wildlife would be 
maintained through time. Project analysis and design would address the location, timing, 
duration, and magnitude of activities to minimize any possible adverse effects. 
 
Potential effects to T&E species under Alternative 3 are often forest-specific. Under the current 
Pike-San Isabel Forest Plan, management direction is less restrictive for all roadless areas where 
the Pawnee montane skipper and its habitat are known to occur than under the other two 
alternatives.  For the Mexican spotted owl, all of the roadless areas on the Pike-San Isabel, 
GMUG and San Juan National Forests with known occurrences or suitable habitat have less 
restrictive management direction under those Forest Plans, while the management direction on 
the Arapaho-Roosevelt, Rio Grande and White River Forest Plans is generally comparable to or 
more restrictive than Alternatives 1 or 2. These two species could benefit from fuels treatments 
that restored more natural conditions and the use of prescribed fire, if applied to the appropriate 
areas and at the proper time of year.  
 
A review of the roadless areas that contain known populations or habitat for the T&E species 
Uncompahgre fritillary shows much less restrictive management direction under the current 
Forest Plans for the GMUG and Pike-San Isabel NFs, with generally comparable direction for 
the Rio Grande and White River Forest Plan, compared with the other two alternatives. Current 
management direction for the roadless areas containing habitat for the southwestern willow 
flycatcher is generally comparable to the other two alternatives, with less restrictive direction in 
some portions of the roadless areas. Thus there is a somewhat higher potential for adverse 
impacts to these species under existing Forest Plans. Again, site-specific analysis and design 
could likely reduce potential impacts to the specific habitats utilized by these two species. 
 
Lynx habitat occurs within most of the roadless areas, and for a number of those roadless areas 
there is the potential for some road construction, tree-cutting and other activities under the 
current Forest Plans.  Fuels treatments that occur in the spruce-fir habitats used by lynx could 
reduce available snowshoe hare prey. Projects would consider the recommended management 
guidance for lynx in their design. All Forest Plans also include management direction to maintain 
lynx habitat connectivity, which would remain in effect. Under the current Forest Plans, 
vegetation management and associated road construction could occur in many of the roadless 
areas that contain the lower-elevation riparian habitats that are utilized by the Preble’s meadow 
jumping mouse. At the same time, reducing the risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfires 
would be beneficial for this species in the long term. 
 
Overall, based on the activities allowed and projected to occur in roadless areas, Alternative 3 is 
not likely to adversely affect any T&E species.  Additionally, Alternative 3 would not likely 
result in adverse modification of designated critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl or 
Preble’s meadow jumping mouse. However, there is a substantially increased risk of negative 
 149 
 
effects or adverse habitat modification on those forests with older Forest Plans: the Grand Mesa, 
Uncompahgre, and Gunnison; Pike-San Isabel; Manti-La Sal; and San Juan National Forests. 
 
Potential risks of adverse effects to sensitive species would be higher under Alternative 3 
compared to other alternatives, based on the increased level of development in roadless areas. As 
with any of the alternatives, project level analysis and design would likely minimize the potential 
impacts to sensitive species. 
 
Road construction is the activity that would have the greatest potential to have negative effects 
on these species associated with wetland, stream, lake and waterfall habitats. As described for 
the other alternatives, fuels treatments within lower elevation conifer forests could have long-
term benefits to sensitive avian species (e.g., flammulated owl, northern goshawk).  Vegetation 
treatment and road construction in subalpine forests could have local adverse impacts on boreal 
owl, three-toed woodpecker, American marten, and pygmy shrew. These impacts would be 
attributed to the potential for increased edge effects, fragmentation and invasive species 
associated with the much higher level of development allowed within roadless areas. 
 
Similar to Alternative 2, there is potential for additional oil and gas development to occur within 
the GMUG and White River NFs, which could have local adverse effects on purple martin if the 
activities occur in its aspen habitat. There is a also higher potential under this alternative for 
adverse impacts to white-tailed ptarmigan. Only low or minor disturbances or impacts would be 
expected for species associated with cliffs/caves/canyonlands, grasslands, meadows, and 
shrublands. 
   
Based on the effects on sensitive species and habitats described above, Alternative 3 may 
adversely affect individuals but would not likely result in a loss of viability or cause a trend 
toward federal listing of any sensitive species on the national forests in Colorado. 
 
There would not be any changes expected in MIS habitat or population trends projected under 
the current Forest Plans. Some local adverse habitat modifications or species impacts could occur 
from road construction and reconstruction, tree-cutting activities, and energy resource 
exploration and development. The risks are associated with direct habitat loss, reduction in 
habitat effectiveness, fragmentation, increased risk of establishment and spread of invasive 
species and pathogens, and human-caused disturbance and mortality. 
 
The status and protection of important bird areas within roadless areas differ with Alternative 3 
with respect to one designated IBA. Under Alternative 3, the Maryland Creek Roadless Area 
may experience some timber management because the area would be managed for general forest 
products. The Forest Service would continue to conserve migratory birds through application of 
Forest Plan management direction and project planning and design. 
 
The effects of Alternative 3, with fewer restriction on land use activities in roadless areas, when 
combined with other cumulative effects activities (increased population/recreation/energy 
demand, climate change), would pose a higher risk of affecting biological diversity, species 
habitats, and populations than the other alternatives. However, these effects will not be uniform 
across forests or roadless areas. As previously described, some forest plans place more 
 150 
 
restrictions on road construction or tree-cutting activities in some of their roadless areas. For 
those with Forest Plans that are less restrictive on activities within roadless areas, effects from 
activities outside the roadless area boundary would add to the potential adverse effects described 
for this alternative. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier 
 
The CRA boundaries are the same as alternative 2, where about 4.19 million acres would be 
managed to maintain roadless characteristics, which would benefit a wide range of wildlife 
species. There are 2,614,200 acres of upper tier within the CRAs; over 2 million more acres than 
alternative 2. The projected amount of new roads and tree-cutting expected in CRAs over the 
next 15 years is described in the Analysis Framework section of this chapter. Under this 
alternative, the Forest Service will offer cooperating agency status to the State of Colorado for all 
proposed projects and planning activities to be implemented on lands within Colorado Roadless 
Areas.   
 
Alternative 4 contains identical prohibitions and exceptions as alternative 2. The difference in the 
projected activities is due to the amount of acres within upper tier. Under this alternative, there 
are 14 miles per year of road construction projected within the CRAs and an additional 4 miles 
per year of road construction projected within the remainder of the analysis area. There are 1,800 
acres per year of tree-cutting projected within the CRAs (1,600 are for hazardous fuels 
treatment). An additional 1,200 acres per year of tree-cutting is projected within the remainder of 
the analysis area (half of which is for hazardous fuels treatment), identical to alternative 2. As 
with alternative 1, there is less than 5 acres per year is projected within the CRAs to improve 
habitat for threatened or endangered species. The same 3 miles/year of linear construction zones 
are projected within the CRAs as alternative 2.  
 
There is an increased ability to treat acres for forest health and fuels management under 
Alternative 4 than alternative 1 but much less than alternative 2; these treatments could improve 
habitats for species that inhabit early seral stages and lower elevation forests with frequent low-
intensity fire regimes. Removal of diseased, dead, and down materials could have negative 
impacts on primary cavity nesters, although forest plan requirements for retention of snags and 
down logs would help limit negative effects. 
 
As this alternative contains more upper tier acres within Colorado Roadless areas, there is a 
lower risk of adverse effects to threatened, endangered, and proposed species as a result of 
temporary road construction and other resource management activities in these areas. However, 
the removal of the provision allowing tree cutting, sales or removal for habitat improvement of 
threatened, endangered or sensitive species in the upper tier may result in higher risk for the 
Mexican spotted owl over the long term of adverse impacts from uncharacteristically severe 
wildfires in its lower elevation montane forest habitat.  None of the CRAs that provide habitat 
for Pawnee montane skipper are included in the upper tier, so the effects are identical to 
Alternative 2 for this species. 
 
Alternative 4 will have similar effects to Alternative 2 for sensitive species. As this alternative 
contains more acres upper tier within the Colorado Roadless areas, there is a lower risk of 
 151 
 
adverse effects as a result of temporary road construction and other resource management 
activities to sensitive species in these areas. However, the removal of the provision allowing tree 
cutting, sales or removal for habitat improvement of threatened, endangered or sensitive species 
may result in higher risk over the long term of adverse impacts from uncharacteristically severe 
wildfires in lower elevation montane forests, shrublands and grasslands. 
 
Given the large acreage afforded roadless protection under this alternative and the upper tier 
acres where little if any activity will occur, any changes in population trends for MIS would 
likely be an increase above current forest plan projections. As this alternative contains more 
upper tier acres within the CRAs, there is a lower risk of adverse effects as a result of temporary 
road construction and other resource management activities to management indicator species in 
these areas. 
 
The Forests would continue to adhere to requirements under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and 
the Executive Order for protection of migratory birds. Similar to the other alternatives, the status 
and protection of important bird areas within roadless areas would not change. 
 
Biodiversity 
 
Based on current literature (see the terrestrial habitat and species section in chapter 3 of the 
RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010), it is possible to conclude that with or without conservation 
of roadless areas, biodiversity is at an increased risk of adverse cumulative effects from 
increased population growth and associated land uses, land conversions, and non-native species 
invasions. Maintenance of roadless areas characteristics may lessen this risk at least in the short 
term (20 years). By reducing the level of potential adverse impacts on roadless areas, some of the 
last relatively undisturbed large blocks of land outside of designated wilderness areas that 
contribute to species biodiversity would be conserved. 
 
The local, regional, and national cumulative beneficial effects of conserving roadless areas on 
threatened, endangered, and sensitive (TES) species and biodiversity could include: 
 
 Conserving and protecting large contiguous blocks of habitat that provide habitat 
connectivity and biological strongholds for a variety of terrestrial and aquatic plant and 
animal species including TES species. 
 Providing important local and regional components of conservation strategies for 
protection and recovery of listed TES species. 
 Providing increased assurances that biological diversity would be conserved at a 
landscape level, including increased area of ecoregions protected, improved elevational 
distribution of protected areas, decreased risk of additional timber harvest and road 
caused fragmentation, and maintenance and restoration of some natural disturbance 
processes. 
 Providing increased assurance that biodiversity would be supported in IRAs including the 
maintenance of native plant and animal communities where non-native species are 
currently rare, uncommon, or absent.  
 
 152 
 
The value of roadless areas in conserving biodiversity is likely to increase as habitat loss and 
habitat degradation increase in scope and magnitude elsewhere. Many roadless areas are adjacent 
to wilderness, national parks, and other designated areas that provide large contiguous habitat 
blocks with national significance for biodiversity conservation. 
 
Some of the potential beneficial effects to biodiversity under the 2001 rule include: 
 Protected large contiguous blocks of habitat providing habitat connectivity for a 
variety of species that need large connected landscapes. 
 Protected large contiguous blocks of effective habitat providing for solitude and 
freedom from disturbance that is required by some species. 
 Decreased risk associated with fragmentation and isolation from timber cutting, 
roading, and leasable minerals activities.  
 Conservation and protection of biological strongholds and other important habitats for 
terrestrial animals, including TES species.  
 Decreased risk associated with invasive species introductions and spread. 
 Maintenance of native animal communities where non-native-species are currently 
rare, uncommon, or absent.  
 Provision of increased assurances that biological diversity would be conserved, both 
in the area and the overall landscape in which it is found. 
 Provision of important components of conservation strategies for protection and 
recovery of Federally listed proposed, threatened, and endangered species and NFS 
regional forester sensitive species. 
 Maintenance or restoration of some level of natural disturbance processes at local and 
landscape levels, which are important controls for ecosystem composition, structure, 
and function. 
The types of potential beneficial effects under the proposed rule and Alternative 4 would be 
similar to those listed for Alternative 1. Relative increases in projected road construction and 
tree-cutting activities in roadless areas under Alternatives 2 and 4 may have adverse effects, but 
corresponding opportunities for fuel treatments and insect and disease outbreak mitigation 
afforded by road construction and tree-cutting could have offsetting beneficial effects. 
 
The forest plans direction alternative (Alternative 3), because of fewer restrictions of land use 
activities in roadless areas, may pose a higher risk of affecting biological diversity, species 
habitats, and populations. However, these effects will not be uniform across forests or roadless 
areas. As previously described, some land management plans are more restrictive of land uses in 
roadless areas than other land management plans. For forests with plans that are less restrictive 
on activities in IRAs, effects from activities outside the IRA boundary would add to the potential 
adverse effects described for this alternative. Potential for beneficial effects resulting from fuel 
treatments and insect and disease mitigation also exists under Alternative 3. 
 
Invasive Plants 
 
 153 
 
Invasive plants for purposes of this discussion include non-indigenous plant species that 
adversely affect the habitats they invade economically, environmentally, or ecologically. 
Invasive plants become established after seed or other plant parts have been imported to an area 
through roads, vehicular traffic, and/or other ground-disturbing activities, and where suitable 
environments exist. They often become detrimental to resource values, and the effects are often 
irreversible. Details regarding the background, analysis, and references for the discussion below 
can be found in the invasive plants section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010). 
 
Opportunity for invasive plant infestations have been created by soil disturbance where native 
vegetation was temporarily removed and weeds invaded the site. Although roadless areas have 
substantially fewer acres of disturbed sites and invasive plants than roaded areas, there are 
localized sites in roadless areas that provide increased opportunity for invasive plant introduction 
and spread, such as where the following activities have occurred or continue to occur: wildfires 
and prescribed burning; mining; timber harvest activities including creating skid trails and 
landings; concentrated livestock grazing; road-building; and recreation activities including 
hiking, horseback riding, camping, and off-road vehicle use. Areas of disturbed soil, especially 
where open to sunlight, can serve as long-term vectors that aid the spread of invasive plants. 
 
Numerous natural mechanisms also spread invasive plants, including wildlife, wind, and flowing 
water. Birds and rodents ingest seed from invasive plants and disperse them in their feces. Big 
game animals carry seed or other propagates on their fur or hooves. Seed ingested by larger 
mammals is carried in the gut, and deposited in the feces, enabling germination in a new 
location. After seed is imported into an area, invasive plants are often able to successfully 
establish in certain habitats even without ground disturbance, because of their aggressive nature 
and adaptability. Once new populations are established by wind, then wildlife or subsequent 
increases of human activity and ground disturbance have been proven to accelerate the spread. 
 
To minimize spread of invasive plants in roadless areas and other NFS lands, the Forest Service 
follows direction in the Invasive Species Executive Order 13112. This E. O. directs Federal 
agencies to use relevant programs and authorities to (1) prevent the introduction of invasive 
plants; (2) detect and respond rapidly to and control invasive populations efficiently and safely; 
(3) accurately monitor invasive populations; (4) provide for restoration of native species and 
habitat conditions in ecosystems that have been invaded; and (5) promote public education on 
invasive plants. To further minimize the risk of invasive plant establishment and spread during 
road building, decommissioning, or other projects, BMPs for invasive plant prevention are 
typically followed. 
 
Although roads can be a contributing factor to invasive plant invasion, roads are often an asset to 
managing and controlling invasive plant populations. For example, the traditional cost of 
chemical or mechanical treatment in Colorado’s forests on an acre of invasive plants is 
approximately $50 to $75 where there is a reasonable amount of road access. Comparatively, 
remote infestations cost five to eight times that amount when hiking, horseback riding, or other 
means of transport need to be used. 
 
Analysis of Alternatives 
 
 154 
 
Since no site-specific activities or effects are proposed as part of the analysis, the potential for 
invasive plants to spread is expressed in general terms, with no site-specific information 
provided. Future planned activities in any of the areas would undergo site-specific analysis to 
assess the localized impacts at that time. 
 
As of 2001, according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture, approximately 3 percent of all 
lands in Colorado were estimated to be occupied by invasive plants at some density. It is 
estimated that on average, NFs in Colorado are treating approximately 5 percent of known 
infestations per year. Current invasive plant management programs on Colorado NFs are at best 
staying even with, rather than reducing, total acres of invasive plant populations, because of 
competing priorities.  Substantial increases in invasive plants on a broad scale are likely to have 
a measurable effect on long term health of forest and rangelands on all NFs. A critical factor in 
the site-specific planning and implementation of future projects is the degree to which prevention 
and early detection/rapid response measures are used. 
 
Rates of spread for invasive plants are variable according to species, habitat, and a variety of 
other factors. Annual spread-rate estimates as high as 14 percent have been documented but may 
be more conservatively estimated to be 5 percent. The amount of acres disturbed can be assumed 
to be 2.9 acres of disturbance per mile of roading. It is difficult to quantify the actual number of 
acres potentially affected by the establishment of invasive plants, however, it can be assumed 
that one half of 1 percent of acres disturbed would actually be invaded. 
 
Equally under all four alternatives, invasive plant populations would continue to become 
established and spread in roadless areas as a result of natural dispersal mechanisms. 
 
A number of human developments and project activities that are ongoing or expected in the 
foreseeable future, as listed in the appendices for the RDEIS, would contribute to the cumulative 
increases in opportunities for invasive plant infestations. Particularly as human populations 
continue to increase adjacent to roadless areas, these developments and human activities will 
likely increase invasive plants. The invasive plants that become established in the WUI areas 
would likely spread into adjacent roadless areas.  
 
2001 Roadless Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
Under Alternative 1, ground disturbance in the roadless areas resulting from potential future road 
construction and other management activities are the lowest of the four alternatives under 
consideration except for the upper tier acres in Alternatives 2 and 4.  By maintaining a high level 
of limitation on future road construction or reconstruction, tree-cutting activities, and leasable 
minerals development within roadless areas, the introduction or spread of invasive plants would 
remain limited to the current rate of invasive species spread resulting primarily from the natural 
mechanisms mentioned in the introductory part of this section.  The use of linear construction 
zones is not limited in this alternative. Although linear construction zones are used for only a 
short duration of time, invasive plants could be introduced. For those areas not included in 
roadless area classification under this alternative, new invasive populations could more readily 
become established due to vehicular transport of seed, and higher levels of human activity, thus 
the rate of spread would likely be expected to be higher. 
 155 
 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule (Proposed Action, Alternative 2) 
 
Under Alternative 2, potential future ground disturbance resulting from management activities is 
intermediate among the alternatives under consideration. Invasive plant expansion due to 
vehicles and human activity, including foreseeable management activities, would likely be 
slightly higher than Alternatives 1 and 4 and less than Alternative 3.  
 
Foreseeable activities that are increased from Alternatives 1 and 4 include road construction and 
tree-cutting for forest health and community protection purposes. Coal development is higher 
under this alternative than alternative 1. Although most roads constructed in this alternative are 
temporary, there is a moderate risk of import of noxious weed seed for the length of the project. 
The use of linear construction zones is limited in this alternative. Increased risks of invasive 
plant establishment and spread are only expected in the small percentage of the CRA acreage 
where these activities will occur. For the majority of the CRA acres, including the newly 
identified roadless acres within the CRAs and the upper tier acres, there is a minimized risk of 
future plant establishment and spread.  The acres that have been removed from the CRAs will 
likely have some increased management activities and may see elevated levels of invasive plant 
establishment and spread. 
 
Forest Plan Direction (No Action; Alternative 3) 
 
Alternative 3 has the highest amounts of potential ground disturbance due to projected road 
construction/reconstruction, tree-cutting, fuels management, and future oil and gas activities, and 
coal activities outside the North Fork coal mining area in roadless areas. The use of linear 
construction zones is not limited in this alternative. Although linear construction zones are used 
for only a short duration of time, invasive plants could be introduced. This alternative would 
therefore result in a substantially higher risk scenario for invasive plant establishment, as 
compared to the other three alternatives.     
 
Under Alternative 3, forest plans include allowances for temporary or permanent forest road 
construction, and tree-cutting, sale or removal for a variety of purposes on many of the acres. In 
these cases, there would be a moderately higher risk of import of noxious weed seed, and 
therefore a higher risk of establishing and spreading new populations. Indirect effects could 
result from the gradual steady encroachment of newly established invasive plant populations 
over the long term. 
 
Proposed Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier (Alternative 4) 
 
Under alternative 4, invasive plant expansion due to vehicles and human activity, including 
foreseeable management activities, would likely be somewhat higher than alternative 1 but less 
than alternatives 2 and 3 due to the activities projected.   
 
Foreseeable activities include road construction and tree-cutting for hazardous fuel treatments 
around communities and coal development in the North Fork coal mining area. The use of linear 
construction zones is limited in this alternative. Although most roads constructed in this 
 156 
 
alternative are temporary, there is a moderate risk of import of noxious weed seed for the length 
of the project. Increased risks of invasive plant establishment and spread are only expected in the 
small percentage of the CRA acreage where these activities will occur. For the majority of the 
CRA acres, including the newly identified roadless acres within the CRAs and the upper tier 
acres, there is a minimized risk of future plant establishment and spread compared to alternatives 
1 and 2. A much greater percentage of CRA acres are identified as upper tier, where little to no 
activity will occur. The acres that have been removed from the CRAs will likely have some 
increased management activities and may see elevated levels of invasive plant establishment and 
spread. 
 
Recreation 
 
Nationally, the top five activities pursued on NFS lands are viewing natural features, general 
relaxation, hiking, viewing wildlife, and driving for pleasure. The roadless areas in Colorado 
often provide outstanding dispersed recreation opportunities, such as camping, canoeing, cross-
country skiing, fishing, hiking, hunting, picnicking, wildlife viewing and OHV trail use. 
Roadless areas in Colorado also provide some of the best gold-medal stream fishing and big-
game hunting opportunities in the United States. While hunting and fishing can occur in areas 
managed for the more developed end of the ROS class spectrum, roadless areas typically provide 
a semi-primitive setting, which is important to some hunters.  
 
As noted in the human dimensions: recreation section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 
2010), the standard Forest Service recreational opportunity spectrum (ROS) classification system 
is used as the basis for analyzing the effects of alternatives on various types of recreation 
opportunities and settings. In general, roadless area characteristics and values include primitive, 
semi-primitive non-motorized (SPNM), semi-primitive motorized (SPM), and recreation classes 
of dispersed recreation in the ROS. However, the presence of motorized trails may provide more 
Roaded Natural (RN) environments. 
 
Dispersed recreation refers to recreational activities that do not require constructed facilities such 
as toilets, camping pads, tables and grills, and other structures. Dispersed recreation includes 
non-motorized activities such as hiking, biking, and backcountry skiing, as well as motorized 
activities such as snowmobiling and OHV use. Dispersed recreation generally occurs in ROS 
settings classified in the Forest Service as primitive, semi-primitive non-motorized, and semi-
primitive motorized classes. Thus, dispersed recreation activities occur primarily outside 
developed campgrounds, picnic grounds, ski areas, and other developed recreation sites that have 
constructed facilities. Much of the dispersed recreational value of roadless areas lies in the 
unique primitive, SPNM, and SPM recreation opportunities and settings they offer. While 
hunting and fishing can occur in areas managed for the more developed end of the ROS class 
spectrum, roadless areas typically provide a semi-primitive setting, which is important to some 
hunters. 
 
In contrast, developed recreation refers to activities that occur at sites with developed or 
modified settings. Developed recreation sites are those with constructed facilities, such as 
campgrounds, picnic or day use sites, trailheads and scenic overlooks with parking areas, 
interpretive sites, ski areas, and visitor centers. Developed recreation sites typically provide 
 157 
 
semi-primitive motorized, roaded natural, rural, and urban ROS class opportunities and settings. 
The roadless areas in Colorado do not generally contain developed recreation sites, except for 
portions of developed ski areas, discussed in a subsequent section. However, access roads, 
campgrounds, and trailheads at roadless area boundaries provide services and entry points into 
roadless areas. 
 
 Analysis of Alternatives: Developed Recreation 
 
None of the roadless areas in Colorado contain developed recreation sites, except for portions of 
developed ski areas. However, access roads, campgrounds, and trailheads along the outer 
boundaries of many of the roadless areas provide public services and entry points into the 
roadless areas. Other than one mile of road projected for construction to facilitate campground 
access under the Alternative 3, the effects of reasonably foreseeable activities on developed 
recreation opportunities in roadless areas do not substantially differ across alternatives. Under 
Alternative 3, there would potentially be additional opportunities for development of recreational 
sites or facilities in IRAs in accordance with forest plan direction. However, as noted, only one 
mile of new road is currently projected for recreation over the next 15 years. 
 
 Analysis of Alternatives: Dispersed Recreation 
 
Under all alternatives, no new roads would be expected to be built in areas allocated in the forest 
plans alternative to a primitive ROS setting, implying that areas with this ROS setting are not 
likely to be affected by any of the alternatives. 
 
 2001 Rule (Alternative 1) 
 
By maintaining the restrictions or limitations on future road construction or reconstruction, tree-
cutting activities, and leasable minerals development within roadless areas, opportunities for 
dispersed recreation in a semi-primitive setting would remain substantially unaltered by future 
management activities. The limited road construction and reconstruction exceptions could 
change the dispersed recreation opportunities within a given area. This level of disturbance 
would not measurably change the dispersed recreation opportunities in any given area. 
   
Existing road density in roadless areas may gradually be reduced over time, as more miles of 
road would likely be decommissioned or obliterated than constructed. Many unauthorized roads 
would be eliminated or naturally disappear. The associated effects would increase the semi-
primitive setting and recreation opportunities from fewer roads in the long-run. 
 
The 2001 Roadless Rule prohibits tree-cutting, sale or removal, with a few exceptions. 
Generally, incidental timber cutting would retain roadless characteristics and would be natural-
appearing, especially after a couple of years when the vegetation has regrown. The projected 
levels of tree-cutting activity would not measurably alter roadless area characteristics or ROS 
classes currently identified, especially over time.  
 
IRAs would continue to provide excellent habitat for wildlife and fisheries; therefore, hunting 
and fishing opportunities would continue.  Retaining the substantially altered areas and 
 158 
 
developed ski areas inside the roadless areas would allow portions of the roadless areas to 
continue to depart from desired roadless area characteristics and values regarding ROS semi-
primitive settings. Visitors would expect IRAs to be substantially unroaded and undeveloped. 
Thus, those portions of the IRAs would continue to conflict with visitor expectations. 
 
None of the projected activities under the 2001 rule would be expected to reduce the quality of 
hunting and fishing opportunities. Retaining substantially altered areas and developed ski areas 
inside roadless boundaries would continue to create conflict or inconsistency with desired and 
expected roadless characteristics and values regarding semi-primitive settings. 
 
Overall, the 2001 Roadless Rule alternative contains large areas with roadless characteristics 
based on limited activities that maintain Primitive and SPNM ROS classes.  Also included in 
these IRA boundaries are areas of substantially altered landscapes from previous tree-cutting 
activities and permanent roads that maintain SPM ROS class. 
 
Colorado Roadless Rule (Alternative 2, Proposed Action) 
 
Most of the projected road construction and tree-cutting activity would likely occur in the semi-
primitive motorized areas, with lesser amounts in semi-primitive non-motorized and primitive 
roadless areas. 
 
Projected road construction/reconstruction could change dispersed recreation opportunity 
settings in some areas from a SPM to RN; however, when roads are decommissioned and 
obliterated after use then the change in ROS would be more temporary in nature. The proposed 
Colorado Rule requires the use of temporary roads or where applicable, linear construction zones 
(LCZs), unless there is specific reason to warrant a permanent road.  
 
Projected Tree-cutting within the CRAs over the next 15 years may change the natural 
appearance of some areas for a period of time until the area regenerates. Under the Colorado 
Roadless Rule, tree-cutting would primarily be done for hazardous fuels management. A 
majority of the tree cutting activities would be within one-half mile of community protection 
zones (CPZs) that are close to communities in Rural, RM, and RN classifications. None of these 
activities would take place in the upper tier acres where roads and tree-cutting for fuel treatments 
is prohibited.  So, dispersed recreation in those upper tier acres would not likely see any changes 
due to exceptions.  Based on projected levels of cutting, a small percentage of the roadless areas 
would be affected over 15 years. Dispersed recreation opportunities would not change as a result 
of tree-cutting, but the feeling of remoteness and solitude may change in some locations for a 
period of time. 
 
Hunting and fishing opportunities likely would not change in areas where tree cutting and 
associated road construction occurs because of the dispersed nature of these activities and the 
large amount of NFS lands not altered by these activities.  
 
The additional roadless acres added into the CRAs under this alternative would help maintain the 
semi-primitive setting and associated dispersed recreation opportunities in the total roadless 
acreage over time. The removal of substantially altered acres and developed ski areas from 
 159 
 
CRAs would help insure that roadless areas appear more natural, less developed and more 
consistent with the typical roadless area characteristics and values. Many of the areas associated 
with commercial ski activity that are removed from roadless boundaries could be developed with 
roads, pending NEPA; removal of these areas would reduce inconsistency with desired and 
expected roadless characteristics and values regarding semi-primitive settings. 
 
In general, under Alternative 2, previously designated roadless areas of limited activity would 
remain Primitive and SPNM ROS classes.  Areas of substantially altered landscapes are removed 
from CRAs and other acres with roadless area characteristics are added resulting in an overall 
increase of Primitive and SPNM ROS classes.  Mitigation techniques would be used to maintain 
ROS classes when tree cutting activities focus on hazardous fuel reductions and temporary road 
construction. 
 
Forest Plan Direction (Alternative 3, No Action) 
 
The higher likelihood of roading, tree-cutting, and energy development under the land 
management plan alternative would create the greatest potential for changes from semi-primitive 
recreation settings to settings that reflect a higher level of development and human activity. 
However, based on the forest plan restrictions on activities in the IRAs, together with 
topographic or economic constraints, new roads and tree-cutting would be projected to occur 
only an a small percentage of roadless area acreage. 
 
Under existing forest plans road construction/reconstruction, tree-cutting, and discretionary 
mineral activities are generally not permitted on areas with management prescriptions of 
Primitive, SPNM and SPM. Some tree-cutting could occur in the RN theme but would likely not 
be done to a degree that would change the roadless character.  
 
The projected levels of road construction/reconstruction could change dispersed recreation 
opportunity settings in some areas from a SPM to RN; however, if roads are decommissioned 
after use then the change would be more temporary in nature. 
 
Projected tree-cutting over the next 15 years may change the natural appearance of some areas 
for a period of time until the area regenerates. The type of cutting would depend on the existing 
forest plan prescriptions and visual quality requirements (see “Scenery” section). Based on this 
level of cutting, a small percentage of the roadless areas would be affected over 15 years. 
Dispersed recreation opportunities would not change as a result of tree-cutting, but the feeling of 
remoteness and solitude may change for a period of time. 
 
Portions of previously designated roadless areas under Alternative 3 could be subject to 
increased tree-cutting, sale or removal and road construction activities that could result in 
substantially altered landscapes not consistent with roadless characteristics.  Based on these 
activities, ROS classes could have the potential to be modified from current SPNM and SPM 
ROS classes to SPM and RN ROS classes. 
 
 Colorado Roadless Rule with Public Proposed Upper Tier 
 
 160 
 
Under alternative 4, tree-cutting, sale or removal and road construction/reconstruction are 
prohibited with specific exceptions.  Approximately 14 miles of roads are projected to be 
constructed or reconstructed within the CRAs; the majority of roads are temporary and 
associated with fuel treatments within the CPZ, for existing oil/gas leases, and within the North 
Fork Coal mining area for coal removal.  No new road construction is projected within the upper 
tier acres. An additional 4 miles of road construction on the substantially altered acres is 
projected over the next 15 years with most of the activity occurring in SPM areas, with lesser 
amounts in SPNM and Primitive settings in roadless areas.  
 
This level of road construction/reconstruction could change dispersed recreation opportunity 
settings in some areas from a SPM to a more roaded type opportunity; however, because the 
roads are decommissioned and obliterated after use, the change in the type of recreation 
opportunity would be temporary. There are currently 8.5 miles of road within the CRAs with 8.0 
miles identified as no longer needed, and the majority of roads projected (14 miles) will also be 
decommissioned after use.  Those roads remaining on the system are generally associated with 
access to private inholdings and will not be open for public use. 
 
Tree-cutting is projected to occur annually on about 1,800 acres within the CRAs and about 
1,200 acres on the substantially altered acres that are not within the CRAs. Depending on 
whether the tree cutting occurs as thinning or as removal of dead material, the projected tree-
cutting on 27,000 acres within the CRAs over 15 years may change the natural appearance of 
some areas for a period of time until the area regenerates. Based on this level of tree-cutting, a 
small percentage of the CRAs would be affected over 15 years. 
 
A majority of this tree-cutting would be done for hazardous fuels management, and would be 
done within one-half mile to one and half mile from at-risk communities in more developed 
recreation settings outside of the upper tier acres.  The acre in upper tier would remain in their 
current recreation setting, but may create concern for local communities if not being able to treat 
those acres would cause hazards for fire fighters or local people if a fire should occur. 
 
Dispersed recreation opportunities would not change as a result of such tree-cutting but the 
feeling of remoteness may change in a few locations for a period of time. Dispersed recreation in 
those upper tier acres would not likely see any changes due to exceptions. 
 
Hunting and fishing opportunities likely would not change in areas where tree-cutting and 
associated road construction occurs because of the dispersed nature of these activities. Some 
species are likely to thrive in the openings created by the tree-cuttings prior to the recovery of 
vegetative conditions.  The use of temporary roads will limit the impact to wildlife and fish 
habitat with decommissioning of the road will be completed as soon as the use is completed. 
 
Recreation Special Uses 
 
Recreation special use authorizations consist of permits, leases, or other written instruments that 
authorize a range of commercial recreational activities, both motorized and non-motorized, in 
dispersed and developed recreation settings. Generally, there is little infrastructure aside from 
 161 
 
existing developed sites that is needed for the permitted activity – with the exception of hut 
systems.   
 
There are about 1,390 recreation special use permits currently authorized in NFS lands in 
Colorado (Region-2 INFRA-SUA database April 2008).  These permits include outfitter and 
guides for hunting, fishing rafting, backpacking, sightseeing, jeep tours, day hiking, ATV tours, 
and educational tours, as well as huts systems, educational camps, resorts/lodges, recreation 
events, and others. Outfitter and guide permits account for about 75 percent of all the recreation 
special uses on NFS lands in Colorado, and some are likely to occur in roadless areas. 
 
There is little difference between alternatives with respect to recreation special use authorizations 
in roadless areas, because limitations on roading and tree-cutting under any alternative would not 
be likely to affect ability to obtain or use a recreation use authorization. Because the 2001 rule, 
the proposed action (Alternative 2), and Alternative 4 do not allow for roading to facilitate 
recreation activities, the special use authorizations in IRAs or CRAs would be limited to uses 
that do not need new roads. Under Alternative 3 (Forest Plans), recreation use authorizations 
could include activities facilitated by new roads in IRAs or CRAs, however, as noted in the 
“Recreation” section above, only one mile of new road is currently projected for recreation over 
the next 15 years. 
 
The agency has also prepared an assessment of small entity impacts (“Opportunities for Small 
Entities (Revised)”) (USDA Forest Service, 2010a) as part of the project record to comply with 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act and subsequent amendments (SBREFA). The section regarding 
Special Use Permits: Recreation in that report states that it is possible that projected road 
development (the majority of which will be termporary) and tree-cutting under the proposed 
action could change some of the semi-primitive recreation opportunity spectrum (ROS) settings 
in the CRAs toward roaded natural settings, implying a change in the feeling of solitude and 
remoteness for some period of time. These effects may have adverse impacts on the capacity for 
some outfitters and guides to provide a quality outdoor experience. However, these effects are 
spread out across 4 million acres of CRAs, and additional areas are added to CRAs under the 
proposed rule, thereby increasing the level of protection of areas currently known to have 
roadless characteristics. Correspondingly, hunting and fishing opportunities likely would not 
change in areas where tree cutting and associated road construction occurs because of the 
dispersed nature of these activities and the large amount of NFS lands not altered by these 
activities under the proposed action. As a consequence, it is unlikely that the adverse impacts to 
special use permit holders reliant upon dispersed or primitive recreation settings will be 
significant. 
 
Other Resources, Services, and Programs 
 
 Geological and Paleontological Resources 
 
Geological resources include such features as large rock formations, craters, and caves. The 
Forest Service often develops geologic interpretive sites or designates special areas based on 
outstanding geologic features. Paleontological resources are fossils of plants, animals, and other 
organisms that lived in former geologic (prehistoric) times. Paleontological resources are 
 162 
 
recognized as important both for their scientific value and intrinsic natural resource value. 
Paleontological resources on NFS lands are protected by laws, regulations, and policies. 
 
The estimated effects on geological and paleontological resources described in the RDEIS 
(USDA Forest Service, 2010) are not expected to vary by alternative. None of the projected 
roading, tree-cutting, and energy resource operations in roadless areas that vary by alternative 
would be likely to adversely affect these geological or paleontological resources. 
 
 Cultural and Heritage Sites 
 
All alternatives require compliance with existing laws and regulations; therefore, before any 
management actions take place the standard process for considering effects would be conducted 
as required by the implementing regulations for the National Historic Preservation Act. In most 
cases, a cultural resource inventory would be conducted. Impacts would be avoided or mitigated. 
Tribal consultation is an integral part of the planning process for management actions; as well as 
consultations with the State Historic Preservation Officer and other interested parties. 
 
For cultural and heritage sites, prior to management actions taking place on the ground under any 
alternative, resource inventories and appropriate mitigation are required by law. Increasing risk 
to cultural resources may occur under Alternatives 1, 4, 2, and 3 respectively, as a result of 
increasing activity projections; however, the risk of adverse effects from uncharacteristic wildfire 
is lowest under the forest plans alternative. In general, the effects on cultural resources are not 
significantly different among the three alternatives. 
 
 Non-timber Products 
 
Current access for the harvest of non-timber products is not expected to change under the 
proposed rule. Conserving roadless areas may limit access opportunities for some individuals, 
but construction and/or tree-cutting may also adversely impact the availability of some species.   
  
 Climate Change/Global Warming 
 
The assessment of effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change is in its formative 
phase. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently (2007) concluded that 
“warming of the climate system is unequivocal” and “most of the observed increase in globally 
average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in 
anthropogenic (human caused) greenhouse gas concentrations.” The lack of scientific tools to 
predict climate change on regional or local scales limits the ability to quantify potential future 
impacts. 
 
None of the alternatives are expected to cause a measurable change in the amount of carbon 
dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions compared to current conditions and trends in the 
roadless areas under the no-action alternative (Alternative 3/Forest Plan Direction). The potential 
categories of cumulative effects of climate change on resources in roadless areas are summarized 
in various specialist sections in the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010), however, the 
cumulative effects of climate change on roadless area conditions cannot be quantitatively 
 163 
 
described in this programmatic evaluation. With regard to energy resources, it is assumed that if 
production is not allowed in roadless areas, the same greenhouse impacts will be moved to  sites 
outside roadless areas and contribute the same amount to the atmosphere. In terms of fuels 
treatments, biomass removed can be burned, used in products, replace fossil fuels, or be left in 
piles elsewhere on the landscape. Except for prescribed burning, any of these disposal methods 
would slow release of carbon to the atmosphere. 
 
Climate change may cause warming and drying trends that could eventually increase the 
magnitude, frequency, or extent of wildfires. Those same climate trends may increase droughts, 
which result in greater insect and disease outbreaks. These effects would be exacerbated in the 
large portions of roadless areas that remain untreated. This cumulative effect may be slightly 
greater under the 2001 rule, followed by Alternatives 2/4 and then Alternative 3 due to forest 
health treatments that would potentially occur under these alternatives. Increases in drought, 
wildfire, and insects/disease would affect hydrologic functions, water yield, and water quality in 
roadless area watersheds. 
 
Cool-season plant species’ ranges are predicted to move north and to higher elevations, and 
extinction of native vegetation may be accelerated; these changes in vegetation may further 
affect air quality. Climate change can also affect terrestrial and aquatic animal species and 
habitats (e.g., changes in snowpack, runoff, base stream flow; changes in hibernation and 
migration patterns; decreases in suitable habitat due to warmer temperatures). Climatic changes 
can combine with direct effects associated with the alternatives; these cumulative effects cannot 
be quantitatively described in this programmatic evaluation. 
 
Agency Costs and Revenues 
 
This section discusses the potential for relative changes in agency costs, across alternatives, for 
activities related to fuels treatments and roads. The proposed rule does not prescribe project-level 
or site-specific activities. As a consequence, agency costs and differences in program costs 
across alternatives have not been quantified. Much of the discussion focuses on cost per acre or 
cost effectiveness to provide a more consistent means of comparing alternatives in the absence of 
quantified changes in agency or program costs. 
 
Treatment projects associated with fuel reductions (that may have secondary effects regarding 
insect and disease outbreak risk reductions) may involve one or more treatment methods 
including biomass removal, mechanical mulching, mastication, and prescribed fire (see fire 
ecology and forest health sections in chapter 3 of the revised DEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010) 
for details about treatment methods). Much of the road construction under the proposed rule is 
expected to be affiliated with biomass removal under service contracts with or without salvage 
rights, stewardship, or a timber sale where receipts can help offset the cost of treatment and 
temporary road construction. However, there may be projects where temporary road construction 
would be needed to gain access for mechanical mulching or mastication. Estimates of the 
number of miles of temporary road construction in roadless areas under each alternative are 
provided by the individual forest units (see chapter 3 of the RDEIS). 
 
 164 
 
The Forest Service also incurs costs associated with planning, preparation, and administration of 
treatment projects. Given the assumption that program budgets will remain relatively flat, it is 
unlikely that the alternatives will result in a change in these costs. The proportion of funds 
allocated to projects in roadless areas may increase or decrease as a function of the amount of 
treatment (e.g., cutting) and road construction projected to occur under each alternative. 
 
 Road Maintenance 
 
Annual road maintenance averages $350 to $6,500 per mile depending on the road maintenance 
level and other factors (based on the Forest Service Region 2 cost guide and forest planning cost 
estimates). Road maintenance costs have been exceeding funding levels for at least the past 
couple of decades18. Thus, there is a backlog of road maintenance needs on NFS land, and the 
Agency has increasingly emphasized the decommissioning of unnecessary roads. The total 
number of forest system road miles has been decreasing over the last 10 years as miles of roads 
decommissioned exceeds new road construction, particularly when considering removal of 
unauthorized roads. For every mile of new road constructed over the past 10 years on NFS lands 
in Colorado, more than 10 miles of authorized or unauthorized roads on NFS lands have been 
decommissioned. It is expected that the trend in closing and decommissioning more road miles 
than are constructed would continue under all alternatives, recognizing that it may become more 
difficult to identify roads for decommissioning over time. There will be a net reduction in road 
density in roadless areas as the Forest Service continues to decommission unauthorized roads or 
authorized roads that are no longer needed. 
 
 Fuel Treatments 
 
If it is not feasible to selectively locate treatments, then a significantly larger percentage of the 
landscape may have to be treated to achieve a given degree of alteration in landscape fire 
behavior. Effectiveness and efficiency of fuel treatments depend in part on locations of access 
roads and natural fuelbreaks. In most roadless areas, the limited amount of roads, fuelbreaks, and 
fuel-treated areas makes them more difficult to treat and more vulnerable to high-severity fires. 
 
To effectively reduce wildfire threats in a WUI, it is usually necessary to strategically place 
treatments at a range of distances from homes or other values at risk. Treatments up to several 
miles away from the value at risk can reduce the fire threat if located where the treatment can 
affect the way fire spreads and behaves. 
 
Under the 2001 rule, fuel treatments would likely be more expensive and less efficient to 
implement in IRAs because of the lack of established roads and inability to reconstruct or 
construct roads. Treatments would generally occur near existing roads, which limits the ability to 
more strategically locate treatment areas on the landscape to improve effectiveness. Prohibiting 
roading in the IRAs would reduce opportunities to cut trees to reduce hazardous fuels in IRAs. 
 
                                                 
18 Up until 1990, the timber sale program provided for substantial amounts of pre-sale and post-sale road 
maintenance, partially mitigating low road maintenance budgets. Increasing recreational use of roads contributes to 
maintenance responsibilities. 
 165 
 
Under the proposed rule, tree-cutting and temporary road construction is permitted for treating 
hazardous fuels in WUI areas within Community Protection Zones (CPZs) extending one half 
mile from at-risk-communities (ARCs), and conditionally permitted in areas that extend an 
additional mile from ARCs (see “Fire Ecology and Fuels” section of this report for details about 
conditions). Roads are often necessary to make treatments economically feasible. Compared to 
the 2001 rule, the proposed rule would therefore provide increased flexibility to achieve fuel 
reductions in critical areas, with some potential for secondary benefits associated with increased 
protection against or insect and disease outbreaks19. Increased road miles would increase the 
Agency’s ability to strategically locate fuel treatment areas on the landscape to improve 
effectiveness and possibly reduce the total amount of the landscape that requires treatment. 
 
Under the proposed rule, treating 5,900 acres per year in CRA and/or IRA areas would yield an 
increasing trend of conducting hazardous fuel treatments in roadless areas, compared with the 
4,400 acres of CRAs treated annually on average from 2001 to 2009. If the Agency treats 5,900 
acres rather than 4,400 acres annually in designated roadless areas, there would likely be fewer 
acres treated for fuels outside the roadless areas, assuming the allocation of funds for fuel 
reductions on NFS lands remains flat. If fuel reduction funds were to increase, this alternative 
provides the opportunity to yield an improvement in reducing wildfire hazard at a landscape 
scale. Alternative 4 is structured similar to Alternative 2, thereby offering similar strategic and 
efficiency advantages regarding treatments. However, due to increased acreage assigned to upper 
tier status, projected treatment levels are reduced under Alternative 4. Assuming 64,000 acres of 
treatments occur on NFS lands within Colorado each year, approximately 9 percent of treatments 
could occur in roadless areas under Alternative 2, decreasing to about 3 percent under 
Alternatives 1 and 4. 
 
Under the forest plans alternative (Alternative 3), if the total NFS budget for hazardous fuel 
treatment remains flat, there would be a shift to treating more acres in roadless areas and fewer 
acres outside roadless areas compared to the past 9-year trend. Given that 13,100 acres of 
hazardous fuels treatments are projected for roadless areas under Alternative 3, approximately 20 
percent of annual fuel treatments (13,100 out of 64,000 acres) on NFS lands in Colorado could 
occur in roadless areas if the Agency continues to conduct treatments on approximately 64,000 
acres per year. If funding for fuel reduction projects increases, this alternative would provide the 
greatest opportunity to reduce wildfire threats to values at-risk. The types of effects of building 
more roads for fuel treatments would generally be the same as described for the proposed rule, 
including increased efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness in wildfire suppression response as 
well as hazardous fuel reduction in WUIs. Under Alternative 3, some permanent roads may be 
constructed in the IRAs for fuel reduction and forest health purposes. Maintaining more 
permanent roads in the IRAs would enhance the effectiveness and value of roads for fuels and 
wildfire management purposes over the long-term. The increased flexibility to build both 
permanent and temporary roads in IRAs would improve the Agency’s ability to conduct 
additional fuel reduction treatments and maintain lower wildfire hazards in WUIs in the long 
term, compared to the other alternatives. 
 
Invasive Plant Management and Control 
                                                 
19 Tree-cutting and road construction are not permitted solely for protection against insect and disease outbreaks 
under the proposed rule, unlike the proposed rule. 
 166 
 
 
As noted in the invasive plants section of this document, the potential magnitude and geographic 
extent of ground disturbance and spread of invasive plants in roadless areas would remain low 
under the proposed rule and Alternative 4, and relatively low under the forest plans alternative as 
well. The overall need to address occurrence of invasive plants on NFS land, in aggregate, may 
also remain somewhat constant across alternatives given the assumption of flat budgets and 
corresponding constraints on the capacity for increasing the annual extent of treatment activity 
and roading. 
 
Although roads can be a contributing factor to invasive plant occurrence, roads are often an asset 
to managing and controlling invasive plant populations. For example, the traditional cost of 
chemical or mechanical treatment in Colorado’s forests on an acre of invasive plants is 
approximately $50 to $75 where there is a reasonable amount of road access. Comparatively, 
remote infestations cost five to eight times that amount when hiking, horses, or other means of 
transport need to be used. 
 
Distributional Effects 
Economic impact analysis requires resource outputs by alternative to estimate associated jobs 
and income. As discussed in respective sections in the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010), 
resource specialists have found that recreation use – both developed and dispersed, water yield, 
and livestock management will not vary significantly by alternative. Assuming no change to 
these resource areas, no change in economic impacts has been estimated across the alternatives, 
and no analysis was completed.  
Commercial timber products (outputs) coming from roadless areas may vary by alternative as a 
function of treatment acreage (see “Road Construction and Tree-Cutting Projections” section), 
but the forest program levels are expected to remain constant. Program budget levels were 
assumed to remain constant across alternatives for all resources. The implication of  is that 
timber program output levels across all National Forests lands in Colorado would also remain 
constant under all alternatives, varying only by location of tree-cutting (i.e., the proportion of 
cutting activity occurring within versus outside of roadless areas will vary). While biological 
implications for roadless areas are dependent upon the location of forest products removed, 
economic impact implications are unchanged. Resource specialists could not distinguish 
differences between alternatives for program level volumes and mix of products removed, so 
additional economic impact analysis was not completed.  
The only resources found to have sufficient measurable and quantitative differences between 
alternatives are energy mineral extraction and fuels management. Production levels of natural 
gas and coal vary by alternative. For natural gas, exploration/drilling differences could be 
estimated as well. In the case of fuels management, the potential for changing community 
exposure to losses by wildfire is also estimated by alternative. 
For details about information discussed in the economic sections below, as well as references 
and citations, see the revised economic specialist report (USDA Forest Service, 2010b). 
 
Economic Impacts

Economic Profile 
 
The Colorado economy is diverse, ranging from urban centers along the front range (the urban 
development from the Denver metro area north to Fort Collins and south to Pueblo) to rural 
communities in the mountains and plains. Known world-wide for skiing and beautiful scenery, 
Colorado enjoys a strong tourism industry. It also benefits from sizable cable and satellite, 
defense, technology, and mining industries (including energy). Roadless area management, as 
described in this document, directly affects only one of these sectors – mining (natural gas and 
coal) – but indirectly affects many others. 
 
As noted in the methodology: distributional effects section, to provide a statewide context for the 
analysis, all Colorado counties were organized into four model areas. A brief description of those 
areas is provided below. 
 
Table 19 offers the same economic variables for all model areas in Colorado. The front range 
metro area dominates the Colorado economy in all respects with over 80 percent of production, 
jobs, and labor income. Some roadless areas are in these thirteen counties (see appendix J). The 
rural roadless model area, with 30 counties, follows in economic importance.  All but one county 
in this area contains roadless areas. The energy roadless area, with only 5 counties, trails only 
slightly in the size of its economy and includes roadless areas in all counties. The eastern plains 
of Colorado complete the picture with about two percent of statewide totals. No roadless areas 
are in this model area.

Table 20 focuses on the mining industry in each model area of Colorado. The energy roadless 
area has greater production than any other part of the State. This is notable given the large oil 
and gas fields north of Denver that have been producing for many years. Employment in the 
energy roadless area ranks second to the front range metro area, primarily because of Denver-
 168 
 
based corporate headquarters for mining companies doing business in Colorado and other parts 
of the United States. For the same reason, income in the energy roadless area trails the front 
range metro area.

The energy roadless model area includes a variety of communities, ranging from small towns – 
such as Somerset – to the economic center of western Colorado – Grand Junction. In prior years, 
this area was primarily defined by retirees, tourism, and agriculture. The area has developed into 
the center of energy development in western Colorado. Table 21 provides a picture of economic 
indicators by industrial sector. The totals are strongly influenced by Grand Junction, a regional 
provider of goods and services.

In a recent study of the Colorado oil and gas industry (McDonald et al., 2007), this sector was 
estimated to provide over 2 percent of statewide employment and 3 percent of earnings. When 
compared with the travel industry, oil and gas provided 56 percent fewer jobs, but only 14 
percent less income. As energy development continues in the State, especially on the western 
slope, these differences can be expected to narrow. Natural gas development in the energy 
roadless area has brought new employees to the region. Some settle in the area as residents while 
others re-locate temporarily. The influx of workers can put strain on housing stocks, goods, and 
services in many communities in these counties. These strains are not expected to dissipate 
quickly. 
All coal mines are up the North Forest Valley of the Gunnison River near the towns of Paonia 
and Somerset. Most coal from Colorado is shipped by rail to the South and Midwest where it is 
used in electricity generation. The balance remains in Colorado where a third is used for 
industrial purposes and two-thirds is used for electricity generation, along the front range. In 
2008, coal from North Fork Valley mines accounted for 42 percent of all coal production in 
Colorado and 1.2 percent in the United States20. These operations are among the largest 
underground coal mines in the county. Like other coal in Colorado, coal from this area is highly 
valuable because of its high energy and low sulfur content. This coal is classified as 
“supercompliant” for electric generation because of these characteristics. Typically, it is mixed 
with coal from other parts of the country to meet air quality standards at electricity generation 
plants. 
 
Values at Risk from Wildfire 
Early in the last century, immigrants from the East and West coasts were drawn to the mountain 
west by the lure of wealth from natural assets such as gold, silver, timber, and forage. 
Communities sprung up – some lasting beyond initial wave of resource extraction and utilization. 
Today many of those communities still find their dependency and identity linked to mountain 
landscapes and benefit from visitors who come to admire the landscapes for their beauty and 
their recreation opportunities (McDonald et al., 2007; Center for Business and Economic 
Forecasting, Inc., 2001; Dean Runyan Associates, Inc., 2006). 
Some visitors come for brief periods, creating the Colorado tourism industry. Small-town appeal, 
big-town amenities, and scenic landscapes have transformed some parts of western Colorado into 
clusters of national and international destinations such as Vail, Telluride, and more rural 
communities, such as Lake City and Ouray. In recent decades, the in-migration of full-time 
residents and proliferation of second homes with seasonal residents have reached significant 
proportions in a number of towns both seasonally or year-round. The economy of these towns 
has become dependent upon their presence and activities (Lloyd Levy Consulting, 2004).  
Table 22 offers a picture of the economy for rural counties not part of the energy minerals areas 
discussed above. This table shows a strong presence of the “accommodation and food services” 
and “arts, entertainment, and recreation” sectors, common in tourism-based economies. There is 
                                                 
20 Sources: Colorado Coal Fact sheets (2006-2007), Energy Information Agency (2008-2009) , and Colorado Mining 
Association (2009) as cited in the revised economic specialist report (USDA Forest Service, 2010b).

also a strong “finance, insurance, and real estate” sector – another hallmark of tourism and 
second home based areas.

High-country communities in Colorado are rich in amenities and have always attracted new 
residents. In recent decades, the in-migration of full-time residents and proliferation of second 
homes with seasonal residents have reached new levels.  Whether they come to stay seasonally 
or year-round, the economy of these towns has become highly dependent upon their presence 
and activities. Many mountain communities are becoming particularly susceptible to natural 
disturbances, such as mountain pine beetle infestations, drought, and wildfire. 
 
The values at risk can include such things as citizen health, reliable water and power supplies, 
infrastructure (both public and private), business activity, and general quality of life. Community 
infrastructure is the most visible and quantifiable value at risk. Homes, schools, retail shops, 
office buildings, libraries, hospitals, and police stations are examples of infrastructure at risk of 
wildfire loss.  Should these assets be lost, property tax revenues, employment, income, health 
care, emergency services, and the general welfare of communities may be affected. 
 
Homes provide a good indicator of more comprehensive community values at risk of wildfire.  
Table 23 displays the 2009 county assessor valuation of non-agricultural, single residence homes 
 171 
 
in Colorado counties that overlap IRAs or CRAs (Colorado Department of Local Affairs, 
Division of Property Taxation. 2010).  The table also displays an estimate of home values within 
500 meters (about 0.3 mile) of public forest land in each county (U.S. Department of Agriculture 
[USDA], Forest Service. 2010), and puts these values in context by comparing the estimated 
home value with total valuation in the county.  The infrastructure value of homes in this setting 
averages 2.8% of total valuation across all counties with either RIAs or CRAs, but exceeds 10% 
in Eagle, San Miguel, Summit, and Teller Counties. Higher ratios may reflect greater economic 
and financial vulnerability to losses by wildfire.  Table 23 does not imply that all properties are 
at risk equally.  It should also be noted that the share of residential valuation to total valuation 
is not equivalent to the share of total property taxes paid by residential owners to local 
governments.

Economic Impacts: Oil, Gas, and Coal Production 
All economic impacts are shown in Table 24.  Results are expressed on an average annual basis 
over the 15-year analysis period.  Only those impacts associated with roadless analysis area are 
included. Job and income impacts are estimated using the annual output of oil, gas, and coal as 
well as the average number of wells developed per year. Projected oil, gas, and coal production 
are equal for alternatives 2 and 4. As noted in the methodology section, the IMPLAN multipliers 
used to estimate job and income impacts are derived from a specific set of cross-sectional data 
regarding employment, output, and expenditures from a single point in time (i.e., year). There is 
uncertainty associated with predicted impacts from the use of multipliers, but the uncertainty is 
expected to have a consistent effect on projected impacts across alternatives. As a consequence, 
greater attention should be focused on the relative differences in impacts across alternatives, and 
not the absolute values or precision of the predicted impacts; projected impacts are 
approximations.The data used to develope IMPLAN multipliers are compliant with the Data 
Quality Act (Section 515 of Public Law 106-554).  For the reasons cited in the “Methodology” 
section, the economic impacts for oil, gas, and coal are modeled using only Delta, Garfield, 
Mesa, Montrose, and Rio Blanco Counties to represent changes in oil and gas production. 
Output Impacts are estimated based on the following development and production levels: 41.5 
wells/yr, 27 billion cubic feet gas/year (bcfg/year), and 4.9 million tons/year coal for Alternative 
1 (2001 Rule); 41.5 wells/yr, 27 bcfg/year, and 12.6 million tons/year coal for Alternative 2 (the 
Proposed Action); and 47.3 wells/yr, 31 bcfg/year, and 12.6 million tons/year coal for 
Alternative 3 (No Action). Annual gas production are therefore equal for Alternatives 1 and 2/4, 
and annual coal production is equal for Alternatives 2/4 and 3. Oil production is included in the 
impact analysis but is relatively inconsequential or negligible (production ranges from 1,750 
(Alternatives 1 and 2/4) to 4,200 (Alternative 3) barrels per year) in comparison to contributions 
by coal and gas production.  Natural gas is the primary energy product in this area (i.e., GMUG 
and White River National Forest areas within the Piceance Basin) with oil being a secondary or 
ancillary product. Annual oil and gas production amounts are estimated only for the GMUG and 
White River National Forest portions of the analysis area as these are the only two forests in 
which production varies across alternatives within the roadless analysis area. Additional 
information about the estimation of gas and coal production is presented below (see “Minerals 
and Energy” section for details about production projections). 
 
Oil and gas production across the three forests with roadless areas where leases currently exist, 
and/or where it has been determined that development is likely to occur under future leases under 
Alternative 3, is presented in the “Minerals and Energy” section in this document. Based on 
those projections, it is evident that production does not vary across alternatives for the San Juan 
National Forest. As a consequence, oil and gas production is added for the two remaining forests 
(i.e., GMUG and White River NFs) and divided by 30 years (i.e., average life of a well). Annual 
gas production is estimated to be approximately 27 bcfg/yr for Alternatives 1 and 2/4 (i.e., 667 
bcfg from White River plus 152 bcfg from GMUG divided by 30 years) and slightly greater for 
Alternative 3 at approximately 31 bcfg/yr (i.e., 753 bcfg from White River plus 174 bcfg from 
GMUG divided by 30 years). Annual oil production is similarly estimated to be 1,750 
(Alternatives 1 and 2/4) and 4,200 (Alternative 3) barrels per year. The value of gas and oil 
production is estimated by multiplying production by 2006 prices ($6.13/Mcf or $6.13 
million/bcfg and $60.23/bo) provided by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission

Price Indices for 2006, as cited in the revised Economic Specialist report (USDA Forest Service, 
2010b). Prices from 2006 are consistent with the economic impact model used to create job and 
income multipliers which is based on 2006 data, as noted in the “Methodology, Data, and 
Assumptions: Distributional Effects” section. The total number of wells developed are presented 
in the “Minerals and Energy” section for the GMUG and White River NFs for each alternative; 
total well numbers are divided by 15 years based on the assumption that all wells will be 
developed within 15 years (even though the average life of a well is 30 years). 
 
While oil and gas extraction in roadless areas is characterized by changes in annual production, 
coal extraction in roadless areas is characterized by constant production over differing lengths of 
time. All recoverable coal reserves in roadless areas are assumed to be economically viable. 
These coal reserves are located in Gunnison County adjacent to the Elk Creek and West Elk 
mines.  There are no reserves in roadless areas adjacent to the Bowie mine.  It is assumed that 
current coal production levels for each mine will continue in the future until these reserves are 
exhausted.  
 
The accessible coal reserves that vary by alternative and are discussed in the Energy Minerals 
section of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010) are gross totals of potentially recoverable 
reserves within roadless areas, estimated to range from 157 million tons under Alternative 1 
(2001 Rule), to 514 million tons under Alternatives 2/4, to 724 million tons under Alternative 3 
(No Action, Forest plan direction).  Gross reserves are estimated at a coarse scale without benefit 
of specific exploration data, and are based on estimations made by the USGS, as noted in the 
Energy Minerals section of the RDEIS. The estimated gross reserves are used to estimate 
average annual production across the three mines currently operating with leases on GMUG 
National Forest land21 over the next 15 years for each alternative using the following steps: 
- Assume that the current remaining reserves on roadless and non-roadless areas available 
to the three mines under the 2001 Rule are equal to the 2004 recoverable reserves for the 
three mines estimated by the State of Colorado22 (i.e., 180.9 million tons), adjusted for 
the documented production that occurred from 2004 to 2009 for the three mines23. The 
adjusted available reserves remaining for the three mines, as of the end of 2009, are 
estimated to be 88.8 million tons24. 
- Estimate additional reserves made available in roadless areas under the proposed action 
and the forest plans alternatives by subtracting the gross recoverable reserves from 
roadless areas under the 2001 Rule from gross reserves available under the other 
alternatives (e.g., 514 - 157 = 357 million tons of additional reserves are available from 
roadless areas under the proposed action or Alternatives 2/4), 
                                                 
21 Production is summed across the three mines (i.e., Bowie No 2+3, Elk Creek, and West Elk mines) to capture 
aggregate production for the North Fork coal area, even though changes in recoverable reserves from roadless areas 
within the GMUG National Forest are projected to occur for only two of the mines (Elk Creek and West Elk).

24 This calculation assumes that the 110 million tons of recoverable reserves in roadless area estimated for the 2001 
Rule in the Energy Minerals section of the RDEIS are included within the 180.9 million tons of reserves estimated 
by the State of Colorado

- Estimate additional years of production for the three mines under each alternative, based 
on the additional reserves and assuming that future production rates are equivalent to the 
average annual production rates from 2004 to 2009. 
- Calculate the average annual production rates, aggregated across the three mines, for a 15 
year period between 2011 (rule implementation) and 2025, for each alternative. Average 
annual production is estimated to be 4.9 million tons per year for Alternative 1 and 12.6 
million tons per year for Alternatives 2/4 and 3. 
Average annual coal production is estimated to be 4.9 million tons per year under the 2001 Rule 
and 12.6 million tons per year under Alternatives 2/4 and 3; these production rates are multiplied 
by $27.44/ton (2006$)25 to estimate output value which is used to estimate economic impacts 
(see Table 24). The estimated production life of the three mines is estimated to range from 8 
years (up to 2018) for the 2001 Rule, to 47 years (up to 2057) under the proposed action (and 
Alternative 4), to 69 years (up to 2079) under the forest plans26 (see Table 23a).

As noted above, the coal reserves available to the Bowie mine are unaffected by the roadless 
alternatives. Under Alternative 3 (No Action), the Elk Creek and West Elk mines are projected to 
continue operations for another 38 years and 69 years (beyond 2010) respectively (see Table 
23a). Under Alternatives 2 (the Proposed Action) and 4, these two mines are projected to 
continue operations for another 24 and 47 years respectively – still an extended period of time 
but less than would occur under Alternative 3. Under Alternative 1, restrictions on road 
construction would result in operations continuing for only two and eight years for Elk Creek 
and West Elk respectively. 
Tables 24 shows the direct, indirect, and induced effects for output (production value), 
employment, and labor income by alternative for the five counties (Delta, Garfield, Mesa, 
Montrose, and Rio Blanco) in the “energy model” area.  Direct effects are realized by the 
extraction and drilling companies from the sale of oil, natural gas, coal, and well drilling 
services.  Indirect effects are realized by local companies that provide goods and services to the 
extraction and drilling industries.  Induced effects result from local spending of employee 
                                                 
25 Price of coal from Colorado Geological Survey, Colorado Mineral and Energy Industry Activities, 2006 (pgs 17-

based on 2006 data, as noted in the economic section in Chapter 3 of the RDEIS. 
26 These estimated production lives are somewhat longer than those estimated in the Energy Minerals section of the 
RDEIS due to the use of slightly lower and more refined production rates compared to a more general production 
rate of 15 million tons per year adopted in the Energy Minerals section.

income paid by the companies directly and indirectly affected by extraction and well drilling 
activities.  
Alternative 3 – the No Action alternative – has the largest total effects on output, employment, 
and labor income contributions associated with oil, gas, and coal related activities. Alternatives 
2/4 has the next largest effects. Compared with Alternative 3, average output would be lower by 
about 6 percent annually and average employment and income would be lower by about 4 
percent. Alternative 1 has the smallest effects.  Compared with Alternative 3, average output 
would be lower by about 38 percent annually, average employment by about 44 percent, and 
average labor income by 47 percent annually over the 15 year analysis period. 
Coal would provide about seventy percent of the labor income under Alternatives 2/4 and 3, and 
50 percent under Alternative 1.  Coal would also provide about two-thirds of the employment 
and slightly more than half of the production value under Alternatives 2/4 and 3. 
Economic impacts displayed in Table 24 are substantially larger than those presented in the 
initial draft EIS (DEIS) completed for the first proposed Colorado roadless rule.  Impacts 
attributable to oil and gas are very similar to those estimated in the DEIS for Alternatives 2 and 
3.  However, impacts under Alternative 1 are nearly three times larger.  In the DEIS, the 2001 
roadless rule was in effect and severely limited the leasing of roadless acres.  In the RDEIS, the 
2001 roadless rule is no longer in effect and substantial leasing of these lands has already 
occurred.  Limitations on road activity to develop the lands for energy production would not 
occur until a Colorado rule is in effect.  Leases awarded prior to the decision can be developed, 
resulting in much higher projections of drilling and production under Alternative 1.   
The largest change compared with the DEIS is associated with coal production, where estimates 
are up to three times larger.  This change is based on revised estimates of recoverable coal 
reserves and its repercussion on mine life.  Because the two mines in Gunnison County are 
expected to operate through the 15-year analysis period under Alternatives 2/4 and 3, annual 
average production, employment, and labor income is nearly as high as current levels.  Larger 
impacts associated with coal under Alternative 1 are the result of a technical correction made in 
the RDEIS.

Local Governments 
 
Mineral Lease Payments 
Sizeable revenues accrue to State and local governments from the production of energy resources 
on Federal lands. These revenues are important contributions to the fiscal health of small and 
large governmental entities alike. Royalties of 12.5 percent are paid on production value from 
Federal mineral leases. Half of these revenues are paid to the states where production originated. 
In Colorado, these revenues are allocated to a variety of State funds, including the State Public 
School Fund, and to local jurisdictions where employees of mining companies reside.

State and local taxes are also levied on the extraction of Federal minerals. County assessors 
determine the taxable value of both production and equipment then apply local mill levies to 
calculate property taxes due. Property tax revenues by county originating only from energy 
mineral activity could not be obtained for this report. 
 
The State of Colorado imposes a severance tax that applies to energy minerals, as well as other 
mineral production. These revenues are distributed among state funds and local jurisdictions in a 
way similar to Federal mineral lease payments. 
 
Analysis of Alternatives 
Federal mineral lease payments, property taxes, and severance taxes have been estimated using 
information provided by the Colorado Department of Local Affairs, Division of Property 
Taxation and the Colorado Department of Revenue (as cited in the revised economic specialist 
report (USDA Forest Service, 2010b)). Payments are estimated for Delta, Garfield, Gunnison, 
Mesa, Montrose, and Pitkin counties (all of which can be considered small entities with the 
exception of Mesa) due to the presence of roadless areas where the likelihood of energy minerals 
activity is projected to change across alternatives27. For property taxes, only revenue based on 
production is estimated.  Personal and other real property may vary by alternative, but estimates 
for these could not be made. 
According to Tables 25-27, Alternatives 2/4 and 3 have the largest state and local government 
revenue effects, totaling $49.7 and $47.3 million, respectively. Total revenues under Alternative 
1 are $28.4 million. Generally, property tax revenues account for the largest share of local 
government revenues.  
Gunnison and Mesa Counties consistently garner the largest shares of local government 
revenues.  Gunnison County is the largest beneficiary of revenues because of sizable coal and 
natural gas production.  Mesa County revenues are solely based on oil and gas production.  
Details regarding production by roadless area can be found in prior oil and gas and in the coal 
sections in this document. 
Property tax revenues vary depending upon the level of oil and gas development, where oil and 
gas development is likely to occur, and whether coal reserves can be mined. Total property tax 
revenues are the highest under Alternative 3, but not all counties share equally . Gunnison 
County shows the largest decrease under Alternative 1 compared with No Action ($1.8 million); 
Pitkin shows the largest increase under Alternative 1 compared with No Action ($0.2 million). 
Montrose County shows property tax revenues only for Alternatives 2/4.  The Horsefly Canyon 
Roadless Area is entirely contained within Montrose County, has oil and gas potential, allows 
roads, but is only available under Alternatives 2/4.  The Montrose County share of total 
production in Alternatives 2/4 is estimated to yield about $111,000 in property taxes per year. 
Because of state distribution formulas for severance taxes and Federal mineral lease payments, 
Colorado counties outside of the energy minerals model area would share approximately $2.0 
million under Alternatives 2 and 3, and approximately $1.3 million under the Alternative 1. 
                                                 
27 The list of counties included in the energy impacts model differs from the list of counties that are projected to 
experience changes in mineral lease payments due to the fact that the location of employees associated with energy 
sector jobs does not coincide exactly with the physical location of mineral activity in roadless areas responsible for 
determining lease payments.

Impacts on revenues for state and local governments are substantially larger than the DEIS.  
Reasons for the change follow those noted above for economic impacts:  a high level of current 
oil and gas leasing  that was not available under Alternative 1 in the DEIS, and longer lives of 
coal mines under Alternatives 2/4 and 3.  Larger impacts associated with coal under Alternative 
1 are the result of a technical correction made in the RDEIS.

Other Revenue Sharing 
Historically, decisions on the management of NFS lands have affected forest revenues and 
subsequent payments to states and counties – often referred to as “25% payments” in reference to 
the share of receipts paid back to state and local governments.  In 2000, the Secure Rural Schools 
and Community Self-Determination Act (SRSCSA) gave counties the opportunity to elect 
payments that would not vary and be independent of NFS receipts.  All counties in Colorado 
elected to receive the SRSCSA, except Douglas, Gilpin, Jefferson, and San Miguel.  Only San 
Miguel could experience a change in forest payments resulting energy mineral development 
activities in roadless areas.  Only fees associated with Forest Service permits for oil, gas, and 
coal exploration and development would affect 25 percent payments to San Miguel County.  
Federal mineral lease royalties are collected by the Department of Interior and not subject to 
“25% fund” payments.  Changes in the payment to the county are not expected to be sizeable 
under any alternative. 
Counties with Federal lands also receive “Payments in Lieu of Taxes,” or PILT. These payments 
are administered by the Department of Interior to help offset the loss of property tax revenues 
caused by Federal ownership. Using a system of formulas, payments are based on county 
population and acreage in Federal ownership less Federal payments from land use in the prior 
year. Federal mineral lease payments are included in prior year deductions. A minimum payment 
is established so that every qualifying county receives some PILT, regardless of prior year 
payments. Federal mineral lease payments estimated for all alternatives could reduce PILT by 
equal amounts. However, PILT payments are subject to Congressional appropriation, and have 
not been fully funded in recent years. Consequently, any reduction in PILT for Colorado counties 
is likely to be smaller than the increase in Federal mineral lease payments. For those counties 
already receiving the minimum PILT payment, no change would occur. 
 
Fuels Treatments 
 
Some roadless areas pose a higher wildfire hazard to communities than others. In addition, each 
alternative poses different management restrictions that may influence the ability to treat 
hazardous fuels within roadless areas.  The combination of these factors can influence potential 
vulnerabilities of wildfire losses to at-risk communities located nearby.  
 
A Community Protection Zone (CPZ) has been defined around all at-risk communities near 
inventoried or proposed roadless areas28.  The CPZ extends a minimum of 0.5 miles and up to 
1.5 miles beyond at-risk communities.  The CPZ that intersects an IRA or CRA is the focus of 
this analysis.  A more detailed description of this analysis area can be found in “Fire and Fuels 
Ecology” section.   
                                                 
28 For the first proposed Colorado Roadless Rule (2008), a CWPP-based definition of the wildland urban interface 
was used to identify at-risk communities that could be affected by roadless area management.  To approximate a 
CWPP-defined WUI and to provide a consistent analysis area, a 3-mile radius from the community center was 
circumscribed around all communities identified to be at risk. 
  
 
 
185 
 
 
National forest field personnel in Colorado projected the likelihood of mechanical fuel 
treatments in each roadless area under each alternative.  The purpose of these treatments would 
be to reduce the risk of losses from wildfire in nearby at-risk communities.  The likelihood 
ranged from “none” to “low” to “high”.  Table 28 shows the CPZ land area, by county, that 
overlaps with roadless areas (i.e., CRAs and/or IRAs) where likelihood of treatments are 
projected to be low to high. Some potential is defined as the combination of both “low” and 
“high”   likelihoods.  High potential is defined as only the “high” likelihood projected by forest 
personnel.  Potential does not mean that these acres will be treated – that depends on project 
funding, overall fuel treatment priorities both in and outside of roadless areas, and other factors.  
However, Table 28 provides a cursory indication of options and likelihoods for reducing wildfire 
risks to at-risk communities by county.   
 
A potential for fuel treatments in either IRAs or CRAs in the CPZ exists in 24 counties.  Across 
these counties, the greatest acreages of potential treatment occur under Alternatives 2 and 3.  The 
counties with the greatest CPZ overlap with roadless areas where there is high potential for 
treatment include La Plata, Park, and Larimer counties. Those with moderate overlap with areas 
of high potential include Archuleta, Chaffee, Custer, and Douglas.  By referencing Table 23 
above, these counties have a minimum of 0.4% to 8.8% of their total valuation in homes located 
in the wildland urban interface. 
 
Under Alternative 1, 16 counties have potential for fuel treatments in the CPZ. The counties with 
the greatest overlap with areas of high potential treatment include La Plata, Larimer, Archuleta, 
and Douglas.  Under Alternative 4, 22 counties have potential for treatments in the CPZ.   The 
counties with the greatest overlap with areas of high potential treatment include La Plata, Park, 
and Douglas.   
 
Table 29 provides a comparison of potential treatment acres between each alternative and 
Alternative 3 (No Action alternative).  This table shows more clearly that there are few 
differences between Alternative 2 and 3 with only two counties showing a decrease and three 
counties showing an increase in potential under Alternative 2.  It also shows clearly a reduction 
in overlap with areas of low to high potential treatment acres under Alternatives 1 and 4.  
Thirteen counties would have a lower potential of treatment under Alternative 1, while Eighteen 
counties would have a lower potential of treatment under Alternative 4. Based on Table 23, 
Eagle and Summit Counties have a sizeable tax dependence on properties in the urban interface 
and would also have some of the largest reduction in overlap with roadless areas with potential 
treatment under Alternative 1.  Clear Creek County is the only one to have an increase in overlap 
under Alternative 1.  Boulder, Clear Creek, Dolores, Grand, and Montezuma Counties could 
have an increase in overlap under Alternative 4, mostly with lower potential for treatment.  
Based on Table 23, Clear Creek and Grand Counties have a modest, but not insignificant tax 
dependence on properties in the urban interface.   
 
Tables 30 and 31 provide another context for understanding potential treatment implications.  
These tables display the share of CPZ acres within National Forest System land that intersect 
with roadless areas where potential exists for treatment.  A high percentage means that potential 
treatments in IRAs and CRAs could play an important role in overall reduction of community 
  
 
 
186 
 
vulnerabilities due to wildfire.  A low percentage implies that treatments in IRAs or CRAs may 
not be as critical for this purpose – though exceptions to this rule may exist.  Fuel treatments 
under Alternatives 2 and 3 in IRAs or CRAs may be especially important for La Plata, Custer, 
Huerfano, Pueble, and Fremont Counties.  Acres with a high likelihood of treatment range from 
about 16% to 38% of all NFS acres in the CPZ.    Of these counties, Custer has the highest 
relative tax dependence (4.2%) on homes in the wildland urban interface.  For most other 
counties, high potential acres are a relatively small share of all NFS acres in the CPZ.  Under 
Alternative 1, only La Plata County shows a high share of all NFS acres for high potential acres.  
Under Alternative 4, high potential treatment acres are a small share of all NFS acres in the CPZ 
for all counties. 
 
Table 31 shows the difference in shares of CPZ acres when comparing each alternative to 
Alternative 3.  This table clearly shows that there are very small differences between Alternative 
2 and 3 when considering the share of all NFS acres available for fuel treatment in the CPZ.  
Alternatives 1 and 4, on the other hand, are lower compared with Alternative 3 in the proportion 
of NFS acres available for fuel treatment in the CPZ.  Compared with Alternative 3, IRAs and 
CRAs under these alternatives may have a reduced role on NFS lands in the context of fuel 
treatments and protecting values at risk associated with at-risk-communities.

Other Community Impacts 
 
The development and production of energy minerals in roadless areas may impose additional 
demands on services provided by local governments.  Higher levels of traffic, greater demands 
for social services, and increased loads on utility infrastructure are examples of additional costs 
that may be incurred by local governments in the Piceance Basin.  While these costs are common 
for areas jurisdictions near energy development, the specific timing, magnitude, and location of 
energy development cannot be estimated at this level of analysis.  Such impacts on local 
governments are typically addressed at the project level when site-specific development is 
proposed.  Because energy markets can be volatile, energy development can begin and end 
quickly, posing significant challenges to local governments in serving residents and visitors 
alike.
