SECTION 1  
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
EPA estimates that complying with the final RICE rule will have an annualized cost of 
approximately $373 million per year (2008 dollars) in the year of full implementation of the rule 
(2013). Using these costs, EPA estimates in its economic impact analysis that the NESHAP will 
have limited impacts on the industries affected and their consumers. Using sales data obtained 
for affected small entities in an analysis of the impacts of this proposal on small entities, EPA 
expects that the NESHAP will not result in a SISNOSE (significant economic impacts for a 
substantial number of small entities). EPA also does not expect significant adverse energy 
impacts based on Executive Order 13211, an Executive Order that requires analysis of energy 
impacts for rules such as this one that are economically significant under Executive Order 12866.  
The RICE rule is also considered subject to the requirements of the Office of 
Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Circular A-4 because EPA expects that either the benefits 
or the costs are potentially $1 billion or higher. EPA, estimates the total monetized co-benefits of 
the NESHAP to be $940 million to $2.3 billion (2008$) at a 3% discount rate and $850 million 
to $2.1 billion at a 7% discount rate in the year of full implementation of the rule (2013). EPA 
believes that the benefits are likely to exceed the annualized costs of $373 million by a 
substantial margin under this rulemaking even when taking into account uncertainties in the cost 
and benefit estimates.  These estimates are “snapshots” of benefits and costs at year 2013.

SECTION 2  
INTRODUCTION 
EPA is promulgating national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for existing 
stationary compression ignition reciprocating internal combustion engines that either are located 
at area sources of hazardous air pollutant emissions or that have a site rating of less than or equal 
to 500 brake horsepower and are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutant emissions. 
In addition, EPA is promulgating national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for 
existing nonemergency stationary compression ignition engines greater than 500 brake 
horsepower that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutant emissions. 
The rule is economically significant according to Executive Order 12866. As part of the 
regulatory process of preparing these standards, EPA has prepared a regulatory impact analysis 
(RIA). This analysis includes an analysis of impacts to small entities as part of compliance with 
the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) and an analysis of impacts 
on energy consumption and production to comply with Executive Order 13211 (Statement of 
Energy Effects).  
2.1 Organization of this Report 
The remainder of this report supports and details the methodology and the results of the 
EIA: 
 Section 3 presents a profile of the affected industries. 
 Section 4 presents a summary of regulatory alternatives considered in the proposed 
rule, and provides the compliance costs of the rule.  
 Section 5 describes the estimated costs of the regulation and describes the EIA 
methodology and reports market, welfare, and energy impacts.  
 Section 6 presents estimated impacts on small entities. 
 Section 7 presents the benefits estimates.

SECTION 3  
INDUSTRY PROFILE 
Compression-ignition (CI) engines CI units almost always operate as lean burn engines. 
They can be configured as either two-stroke lean burn (2SLB) or 4-stroke lean burn (4SLB); the 
distinction is that CI engines are fueled by distillate fuel oil (diesel oil), not by natural gas. 
Industries in which CI engines are found are: 
 
 electric power generation, transmission, and distribution (NAICS 2211) 
 oil and gas extraction (including marginal wells) (NAICS 211111) 
 pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 211112), 
 general medical and surgical hospitals (NAICS 622110) 
 irrigation sets and welding equipment (NAICS 335312 and 333992). 
This section provides an introduction to the industries affected by the rule. The purpose is 
to give the reader a general understanding of the economic aspects of the industry; their relative 
size, relationships with other sectors in the economy, trends for the industries, and financial 
statistics. The sectors discussed are 
3.1 Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution 
3.1.1 Overview 
Electric power generation, transmission, and distribution (NAICS 2211) is an industry 
group within the utilities sector (NAICS 22). It includes establishments that produce electrical 
energy or facilitate its transmission to the final consumer.  
From 1997 to 2002, revenues from electric power grew about 10% to over $373 billion 
($2007) (Table 3-1). At the same time, payroll rose about 6.5% and the number of employees 
decreased by over 5%. The number of establishments rose by over 15%, resulting in a decrease 
in average establishment revenue of almost 7%. Industrial production within NAICS 2211 has 
increased 25% since 1997 (Figure 3-1).  
Electric utility companies have traditionally been tightly regulated monopolies. Since 
1978, several laws and orders have been passed to encourage competition within the electricity 
market. In the late 1990s, many states began the process of restructuring their utility regulatory 
framework to support a competitive market. Following market manipulation in the early 2000s, 
however, several states have suspended their restructuring efforts. The majority (58%) of diesel 
 3-2 
power generators controlled by combined heat and power (CHP) or independent power 
producers are located in states undergoing active restructuring (Figure 3-2).

associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines (oil and gas extraction, pipeline 
transportation, petroleum refineries, and turbine manufacturing) represent around 10% of the 
value of services.

establishments in the same state and industry that were specified under common 
ownership or control. The firm and the establishment are the same for single-
establishment firms. For each multiestablishment firm, establishments in the same 
industry within a state are counted as one firm; the firm employment and annual 
payroll are summed from the associated establishments. 
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
 3-5 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multiestablishment company forms one enterprise; the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
In 2002, Texas had almost 1,000 power establishments, while California, Georgia, and 
Ohio all had between 400 and 500 (Figure 3-3). Hawaii, Nebraska, and Rhode Island all had 
fewer than 20 establishments in their states.

As shown in Table 3-3, the four largest firms owned over 1,200 establishments and 
accounted for about 16% of total industry receipts/revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for 
almost 6,000 establishments and about 78% of total receipts/revenue.  
Investor-owned energy providers accounted for 67.5% of retail electricity sold in the 
United States in 2006 (Table 3-4). In 2007, less regulated investor-owned electric utility 
companies were on average more profitable than companies with greater regulation (Table 3-5). 
In 2006, enterprises within NAICS 2211 had a pre-tax profit margin of only 0.9% (Table 3-6). 
 3-6 
In 2002, about 82% of firms generating, transmitting, or distributing electric power had 
receipts of under $50 million (Table 3-7). However, these firms accounted for only 11% of 
employment, with 89% of employees working for firms with revenues in excess of $100 million. 
3.2 Oil and Gas Extraction 
3.2.1 Overview 
Oil and gas extraction (NAICS 211) is an industry group within the mining sector 
(NAICS 21). It includes establishments that operate or develop oil and gas field properties

through such activities as exploring for oil and gas, drilling and equipping wells, operating on-
site equipment, and conducting other activities up to the point of shipment from the property.  
Oil and gas extraction consists of two industries: crude petroleum and natural gas 
extraction (NAICS 211111) and natural gas liquid extraction (NAICS 211112). Crude petroleum 
and natural gas extraction is the larger industry; in 2002, it accounted for 93% of establishments 
and 75% of oil and gas extraction revenues. 
Industrial production in this industry is particularly sensitive to hurricanes in the Gulf 
Coast. In September of both 2005 and 2008, production dropped 14% from the previous month. 
Production is currently 6% lower than it was in 1997 (Figure 3-4). 
From 1997 to 2002, revenues from crude petroleum and natural gas extraction (NAICS 
211111) grew less than 1% to almost $100 billion ($2007) (Table 3-8). At the same time, payroll 
 3-7 
dropped almost 8% and the number of employees dropped by almost 6%. The number of 
establishments dropped by over 8%; as a result, the average establishment revenue increased by 
2.5%. Materials costs were approximately 25% of revenue over the period. 
From 1997 to 2002, revenue from natural gas liquid extraction (NAICS 211112) grew 
over 7% to about $34 billion (Table 3-9). At the same time, payroll dropped 12% and the number 
of employees dropped by almost 9%. The number of establishments dropped by over 3%, 
resulting in an increase of revenue per establishment of about 10%.

3.2.2 Goods and Services Used 
The oil and gas extraction industry has similar labor and tax requirements as the electric 
power generation sector. Extraction, support, power, and equipment requirements potentially 
associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines (oil and gas extraction, support 
activities, electric power generation, machinery and equipment rental and leasing, and pipeline 
transportation) represent around 8% of the value of services (Table 3-10). 
3.2.3 Business Statistics 
The U.S. Economic Census and SUSB programs provide national information on the 
distribution of economic variables by industry, location, and size of business. Throughout this 
section and report, we use the following definitions:

This industry includes small-volume wells that are mature in age, are more difficult to extract oil 
or natural gas from than other types of wells, and generally operate at very low levels of 
profitability. As a result, well operations can be quite responsive to small changes in the benefits 
and costs of their operation. 
In 2006, there were approximately 420,000 marginal oil wells and 300,000 marginal gas 
wells (Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission [IOGCC], 2007). These wells provide the 
United States with 18% of oil and 9% of natural gas production (IOGCC, 2007). Data for 2006 
show that revenue from the over 700,000 wells was approximately $31.3 billion (Table 3-14). 
Historical data show marginal oil production fluctuated between 1997 and 2006, 
reflecting the industry’s sensitivity to changes in economic conditions of fuel markets (see

Figure 3-7). In contrast, the number of marginal gas wells has continually increased during the 
past decade; the IOGCC estimates that daily production levels from these wells reached a 
10-year high in 2005. Although we have been unable to find data on what fraction of these 
marginal wells are operated by small businesses, the IOGCC states that many are run by “mom 
and pop operators” (IOGCC, 2007). 
3.3 Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas 
3.3.1 Overview 
Pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 48621) is an industry group within the 
transportation and warehousing sector (NAICS 48-49), but more specifically in the pipeline 
transportation subsector (486). It includes the transmission of natural gas as well as the 
distribution of the gas through a local network to participating businesses.  
From 1997 to 2002, natural gas transportation revenues fell by 7% to just under $23 
billion ($2007) (Table 3-15). At the same time, payroll decreased by 7%, while the number of 
paid employees decreased by nearly 9%. However, the number of establishments increased by 
17% from 1,450 establishments in 1997 to 1,701 in 2002. 
3.3.2 Goods and Services Used 
The BEA reports pipeline transportation of natural gas only for total pipeline 
transportation (3-digit NAICS 486). In addition to pipeline transportation of natural gas (NAICS 
4862), this industry includes pipeline transportation of crude oil (NAICS 4861) and other 
pipeline transportation (NAICS 4869). However, the BEA data are likely representative of the 
affected sector since pipeline transportation of natural gas accounts for 68% of NAICS 486 
establishments and 72% of revenues (Figures 3-8 and 3-9).

(2002) to identify the goods and services used by pipeline transportation (NAICS 486). As 
shown, labor, refineries, and maintenance requirements represent significant share of the cost 
associated with pipeline transportation. Power and equipment requirements potentially associated 
with reciprocating internal combustion engines (electric power generation and commercial and 
industrial machinery and equipment repair and maintenance) represent less than 2% of the value 
of services.

3.3.3 Business Statistics 
The pipeline transportation of natural gas is clearly concentrated in the two states closest 
to the refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2002, Texas and Louisiana contributed to 31% of all 
pipeline transportation establishments in the United States (Figure 3-10) and 41% of all U.S. 
revenues. Other larger contributors with over 50 establishments in their states include Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia.

Geographic Distribution—Pipeline transportation of natural gas: 2002.” <http://factfinder.census.gov>; 
(November 10, 2008). 
According to 2002 U.S. Census data, about 86% of transportation of natural gas 
establishments were owned by corporations and about 8% were owned by individual 
proprietorships. About 6% were owned by partnerships (Figure 3-11). As shown in Table 3-17, 
the four largest firms accounted for nearly half of the establishments with 698, and just over half, 
51%, of total revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for over 1,354 establishments and about 
99% of total revenue. The average number of employees per establishment was approximately 
17 across all groups of firms.  
Enterprises within pipeline transportation (NAICS 486) generated $6.6 billion in total 
receipts in 2006. Including those enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after-
tax profit margin of 7.9% (Table 3-18). 
The 2002 SUSB shows that 47% of all firms in this industry made under $5 million in 
revenue. Enterprises with revenue over $100 million provided an overwhelming share of 
employment in this industry (98%) (Table 3-19).

3.4 General Medical and Surgical Hospitals 
3.4.1 Overview 
General medical and surgical hospitals (NAICS 6221) is an industry group within the 
health care and social assistance sector (NAICS 62). It includes hospitals engaged in diagnostic 
and medical treatment (both surgical and nonsurgical) for inpatients with a broad range of 
medical conditions. They usually provide other services as well, including outpatient care, 
anatomical pathology, diagnostic X-rays, clinical laboratory work, and pharmacy services.  
From 1997 to 2002, hospital revenues grew about 18% to over $500 billion ($2007) 
(Table 3-20). At the same time, payroll rose about 14%, while the number of employees 
increased by only 5%. The number of establishments declined during this period by almost 6%, 
resulting in an increase in revenue per establishment of almost 22%. 
3.4.2 Goods and Services Used 
The BEA reports hospital expenditures only for hospitals (3-digit NAICS 622). In 
addition to general hospitals (NAICS 6221), this industry includes psychiatric and substance 
abuse hospitals (NAICS 6222) and specialty hospitals (NAICS 6223). However, these data 
should be representative of the affected sector since in 2002, general medical and surgical 
hospitals accounted for 92% of NAICS 622 establishments and 94% of revenues. 
In Table 3-21, we use the latest detailed benchmark input-output data report by the BEA 
(2002) to identify the goods and services used by hospitals (NAICS 622). As shown, labor and 
land requirements represent a significant share of the value of hospital services. Power and 
equipment requirements potentially associated with reciprocating internal combustion engines 
(electric power generation and commercial and industrial machinery and equipment repair and 
maintenance) represent less than 2% of the value of services.

(November 10, 2008). 
According to 2002 Census data, 79.6% of general hospitals were owned by corporations, 
19.5% were individual proprietorships, and about 0.7% were partnerships (Figure 3-13). As 
shown in Table 3-22, the four largest firms accounted for almost 400 establishments and about 
10% of total revenue. The 50 largest firms accounted for over 1,100 establishments and about 
30% of total revenue. In addition, about 27% of all general hospitals are owned or controlled by 
the government, with most of those at the local level (Table 3-23). 
In 2006, the United States had 4,927 community hospitals (Table 3-24); 
nongovernmental not-for-profit hospitals accounted for 59% of these hospitals, and 75% of the 
expenses of all community hospitals.  
Enterprises including hospitals, nursing and residential care facilities, and social 
assistance (NAICS 622-4) generated $108 billion in total receipts in 2006. Including those 
enterprises without net income, the industry averaged an after-tax profit margin of 3.1% (Table 
3-25).

3.5 Irrigation Sets and Welding Equipment 
3.5.1 Overview 
The U.S. Economic Census classifies irrigation equipment under the farm machinery and 
equipment manufacturing industry group (NAICS 333111). This U.S. industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing agricultural and farm machinery and 
equipment and other turf and grounds care equipment, including planting, harvesting, and grass-
mowing equipment (except lawn and garden type).  
From 1997 to 2002, farm machinery and equipment manufacturing revenues fell by $3 
billion from $18 billion to $15 billion (Table 3-27). At the same time, payroll decreased by 19% 
and the number of paid employees decreased by nearly 19%. The number of establishments 
dropped by 9% from 1,339 establishments in 1997 to 1,214 in 2002. Industrial production in the 
industry is currently 13% lower than in 1997 (Figure 3-14). 
The U.S. Economic Census classifies welding equipment under the welding and 
soldering equipment manufacturing industry group (NAICS 333992). This U.S. industry 
comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing welding and soldering equipment 
and accessories (except transformers), such as welding electrodes, welding wire, and soldering 
equipment (except handheld). 
From 1997 to 2002 welding and soldering equipment manufacturing revenue fell by 
about 22% to $1 billion (Table 3-28). At the same time, payroll decreased by 21% and the 
number of paid employees decreased by nearly 28%. The number of establishments dropped by 
8% from 250 establishments in 1997 to 231 in 2002. 
3.5.2 Irrigation and Welding Services 
The demand for equipment is derived from the demand for the services the equipment 
provides. We describe uses and industrial consumers of this equipment. 
3.5.2.1 Irrigation 
Demand for irrigation equipment is driven by farm operation decisions, optimal 
replacement considerations, and climate and weather conditions. The National Agriculture 
Statistics Service (NASS) 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (USDA-NASS, 2004) shows

that the top five states ranked by total acres irrigated are California, Nebraska, Texas, Arkansas, 
and Idaho. Approximately 32 million of the 53 million, or 68%, of U.S. irrigated acres are used 
to support oilseed and grain farming and other crop farming (tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and 
other).  Virtually all of these irrigated areas are west of the Mississippi River.   
The survey reported that approximately 500,000 pumps were used on U.S. farms in 2003 
with energy expenses totaling $1.6 billion. Electricity is the dominant form of energy expense for 
irrigation pumps, accounting for 60% of total energy expenses. Diesel fuel is second (18%), 
followed by natural gas (18%) and other forms of energy such as gasoline (4%).  
Per-acre operating costs for these irrigation systems vary by fuel type, and natural gas 
was the most expensive in 2003 ($57 per acre for well systems and $34 per acre for surface water 
systems) (Table 3-29). Systems using diesel fuel were operated at approximately half of these 
per-acre costs ($25 per acre for well systems and $16 per acre for surface water systems). 
Gasoline- and gasohol-powered systems offered the least expensive operating costs ($12 per acre 
for well systems and $18 per acre for surface water systems).  
As shown in Table 3-30, the number of on-farm pumps fell from 508,727 to 497,443 
(2%) between 1998 and 2003. However, the use of electric- and diesel-powered pumps increased 
during this period (3% and 4%, respectively), while other fuel sources such as gasoline declined 
significantly. Pumps powered by gasoline and gasohol, for example, declined from 8,965 to 
6,178, a 31% change during this period. Pumps powered by natural gas, LP gas, propane, and 
butane also declined by 26% to 29%. Although 1998 operating cost data are not available, the 
change in relative costs of operation across fuels between 1998 and 2003 may partly explain

these patterns. Although no information is available on the use and construction of on-farm 
pumps specifically, their use is tied to the amount of agricultural land in production. USDA 
reports that planted acres of the eight major crops hit a 5-year high of 252 million acres in 2008 
but will fall and level off to around 244 million acres over the next 2 to 4 years (USDA, 2008). 
3.5.2.2 Welding  
Welding is used in a wide variety of applications. One of the biggest manufacturers of 
welding products identifies the following key end-user segments: 
 general metal fabrication; 
 infrastructure including oil and gas pipelines and platforms, buildings, bridges, and 
power generation; 
 3-33 
 transportation and defense industries (automotive, trucks, rail, ships, and aerospace); 
 equipment manufacturers in construction, farming, and mining; 
 retail resellers; and 
 rental market (Lincoln Electric Holdings, 2006). 
Lincoln Electric further describes the following key applications: power generation and process 
industries, offshore production of oil and gas, pipelines/pipemills, and heavy fabrication 
(earthmoving and construction equipment and agricultural and farm equipment. 
3.5.3 Business Statistics 
In 2003, California and Texas each had more than 5 million irrigated acres (Figure 3-15). 
Midwest states like Arkansas and Nebraska had more than 2.5 million irrigated acres. Heavy and 
civil engineering construction establishments are spread throughout the United States, 
particularly in areas such as California, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida (Figure 3-16). Each 
of these states has more than 2,000 establishments.

As shown in Table 3-31, the market value of agriculture products sold was less than 
$25,000 per year on almost half the irrigated farms in the 2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation 
Survey. Over 90% of the irrigated farms had agricultural product revenue below $750,000. It is 
not clear what fraction of these farms use stationary diesel engines or are owned by corporate 
farming operations. Thus, there is uncertainly about how many of these irrigated farms have 
stationary diesel engines that will be impacted by this rule.  In addition, there is uncertainty about 
what fraction of these farms are small businesses.  However, SUSB data also suggest 65% of 
firms in NAICS 11 have receipts less than $500,000 per year.

As noted earlier, welding equipment is used in heavy fabrication such as earthmoving and 
construction equipment. We focus on the size distribution for a representative sector in this 
section (NAICS 327, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction); other subsections in Section 2 
cover other sectors that potentially use equipment powered by diesel engines (e.g., power 
generation and offshore gas distribution). As shown in Table 3-33, SUSB data suggest 60% of 
firms in this industry have receipts less than $1 million per year; 90% are below the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) threshold on $50 million per year. However, it is not clear what 
fraction of these firms use stationary diesel engines.

SECTION 4  
REGULATORY ALTERNATIVES, COSTS, AND EMISSION IMPACTS 
4.1 Background 
This section of the RIA includes a discussion of the regulatory alternatives considered for 
the final rule, the costs associated with these regulatory alternatives, and the impacts on affected 
emissions (both HAP and non-HAP). All impacts presented are for the year of full 
implementation, 2013.   Although the estimates presented are annualized, they should be 
understood as a “snapshot” in analyzing costs. 
This action promulgates NESHAP for existing stationary CI RICE with a site rating of 
less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources, existing non-emergency CI engines with a 
site rating greater than 500 hp at major sources, and existing stationary CI RICE of any power 
rating located at area sources. EPA is finalizing these requirements to meet its statutory 
obligation to address HAP emissions from these sources under sections 112(d), 112(c)(3) and 
112(k) of the CAA. The final NESHAP for stationary CI RICE will be promulgated under 40 
CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, which already contains standards applicable to new stationary RICE 
and some existing stationary RICE.  
EPA promulgated NESHAP for existing, new, and reconstructed stationary RICE greater 
than 500 hp located at major sources on June 15, 2004 (69 FR 33474). EPA promulgated 
NESHAP for new and reconstructed stationary RICE that are located at area sources of HAP 
emissions and for new and reconstructed stationary RICE that have a site rating of less than or 
equal to 500 hp that are located at major sources of HAP emissions on January 18, 2008 (73 FR 
3568). At that time, EPA did not promulgate final requirements for existing stationary RICE that 
are located at area sources of HAP emissions or for existing stationary RICE that have a site 
rating of less than or equal to 500 hp that are located at major sources of HAP emissions. 
Although EPA proposed requirements for these sources, EPA did not finalize these requirements 
due to comments received indicating that the proposed Maximum Achievable Control 
Technology (MACT) determinations for existing sources were inappropriate and because of a 
decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on March 13, 2007, 
which vacated EPA’s MACT standards for the Brick and Structural Clay Products 
Manufacturing source category (40 CFR part 63, subpart JJJJJ). Sierra Club v. EPA, 479 F.3d 
875 (DC Cir 2007). Among other things, the D.C. Circuit found that EPA’s no emission 
reduction MACT determination in the challenged rule was unlawful. Because in the proposed 
stationary RICE rule, EPA had used a MACT floor methodology similar to the methodology 
 4-2 
used in the Brick MACT, EPA decided to re-evaluate the MACT floors for existing major 
sources that have a site rating of less than or equal to 500 brake hp consistent with the Court’s 
decision in the Brick MACT case. EPA has also re-evaluated the standards for existing area 
sources in light of the comments received on the proposed rule.  
In addition, stakeholders have encouraged the Agency to review whether there are further 
ways to reduce emissions of pollutants from existing stationary diesel engines. In its comments 
on EPA’s 2005 proposed rule for new stationary diesel engines (70 FR 39870), the 
Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) suggested several possible avenues for the regulation of 
existing stationary diesel engines, including use of diesel oxidation catalysts or catalyzed diesel 
particulate filters (CDPF), as well as the use of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel. EDF 
suggested that such controls can provide significant pollution reductions at reasonable cost. EPA 
issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in January 2008, where it solicited 
comment on several issues concerning options to regulate emissions of pollutants from existing 
stationary diesel engines, generally, and specifically from larger, older stationary diesel engines. 
EPA solicited comment and collected information to aid decision-making related to the reduction 
of HAP emissions from existing stationary diesel engines and specifically from larger, older 
engines under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112 authorities. The Agency sought comment on the 
larger, older engines because available data indicate that those engines emit the majority of 
particulate matter (PM) and toxic emissions from nonemergency stationary engines as a whole. 
A summary of comments and responses that were received on the ANPRM is included in docket 
EPA-HQ-OAR-2007-0995. 
EPA has taken several actions over the past several years to reduce exhaust pollutants 
from stationary diesel engines, but believes that further reducing exhaust pollutants from 
stationary diesel engines, particularly existing stationary diesel engines that have not been 
subject to Federal standards, is justified. Therefore, EPA is finalizing emissions reductions from 
existing stationary diesel engines. 
4.2 Summary of the Proposed Rule 
4.2.1 What Is the Source Category Regulated by this Proposed Rule?  
This final rule addresses emissions from existing stationary CI engines less than or equal 
to 500 hp located at major sources and all existing stationary CI engines located at area sources. 
This final rule also addresses emissions from existing stationary nonemergency CI engines 
greater than 500 hp at major sources. A major source of HAP emissions is a stationary source 
that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or 
 4-3 
more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per 
year, except that for oil and gas production facilities, a major source of HAP emissions is 
determined for each surface site.  An area source of HAP emissions is a source that is not a major 
source.  
This action revises the regulations at 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, currently applicable 
to new and reconstructed stationary RICE and to existing stationary RICE greater than 500 hp 
located at major sources. Through this action, we are adding to subpart ZZZZ requirements for:  
existing CI stationary RICE less than or equal to 500 HP located at major sources and existing CI 
stationary RICE located at area sources. When the subpart ZZZZ regulations were promulgated 
(see 69 FR 33474, June 15, 2004), EPA deferred promulgating regulations with respect to 
stationary engines 500 hp or less at major sources until further information on the engines could 
be obtained and analyzed. EPA decided to regulate these smaller engines at the same time that it 
regulated engines located at area sources. EPA issued regulations for new stationary engines 
located at area sources of HAP emissions and new stationary engines located at major sources 
with a site rating of 500 hp or less in the rulemaking issued on January 18, 2008 (73 FR 3568), 
but did not promulgate a final regulation for existing stationary engines.  
4.2.1.1 Stationary CI RICE ≤500 hp at Major Sources  
This action revises 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, to address HAP emissions from 
existing stationary CI RICE less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources. For stationary 
engines less than or equal to 500 hp at major sources, EPA must determine what is the 
appropriate MACT for those engines under section 112(d) (2) and (d)(3) of the CAA. 
EPA has divided stationary CI RICE into emergency and nonemergency engines in order 
to capture the unique differences between these types of engines. 
4.2.1.2 Stationary CI RICE at Area Sources 
This action revises 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, in order to address HAP emissions 
from existing stationary RICE located at area sources. Section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA) requires EPA to establish national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 
(NESHAP) for both major and area sources of HAP that are listed for regulation under CAA 
section 112(c).  
Section 112(k)(3)(B) of the CAA calls for EPA to identify at least 30 HAP that, as a 
result of emissions of area sources, pose the greatest threat to public health in the largest number 
of urban areas. EPA implemented this provision in 1999 in the Integrated Urban Air Toxics 
 4-4 
Strategy (64 FR 38715, July 19, 1999). Specifically, in the Strategy, EPA identified 30 HAP that 
pose the greatest potential health threat in urban areas, and these HAP are referred to as the “30 
urban HAP.” Section 112(c)(3) requires EPA to list sufficient categories or subcategories of area 
sources to ensure that area sources representing 90 percent of the emissions of the 30 urban HAP 
are subject to regulation. EPA implemented these requirements through the Integrated Urban Air 
Toxics Strategy (64 FR 38715, July 19, 1999). The area source stationary engine source category 
was one of the listed categories. A primary goal of the Strategy is to achieve a 75 percent 
reduction in cancer incidence attributable to HAP emitted from stationary sources.  
Under CAA section 112(d)(5), EPA may elect to promulgate standards or requirements 
for area sources “which provide for the use of generally available control technologies or 
management practices by such sources to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants.” 
Additional information on generally available control technologies (GACT)- or management 
practices is found in the Senate report on the legislation (Senate report Number 101-228, 
December 20, 1989), which describes GACT as: 
. . . methods, practices and techniques which are commercially available and appropriate 
for application by the sources in the category considering economic impacts and the 
technical capabilities of the firms to operate and maintain the emissions control systems. 
 
Consistent with the legislative history, EPA can consider costs and economic impacts in 
determining GACT, which is particularly important when developing regulations for source 
categories, like this one, that have many small businesses. 
Determining what constitutes GACT involves considering the control technologies and 
management practices that are generally available to the area sources in the source category. 
EPA also considers the standards applicable to major sources in the same industrial sector to 
determine if the control technologies and management practices are transferable and generally 
available to area sources. In appropriate circumstances, EPA may also consider technologies and 
practices at area and major sources in similar categories to determine whether such technologies 
and practices could be considered generally available for the area source category at issue. 
Finally, as EPA has already noted, in determining GACT for a particular area source category, 
EPA considers the costs and economic impacts of available control technologies and 
management practices on that category.  
The urban HAP that must be regulated at stationary RICE to achieve the section 
112(c)(3) requirement to regulate categories accounting for 90 percent of the urban HAP are: 7 
PAH, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, arsenic, benzene, beryllium compounds, and cadmium 
 4-5 
compounds. As explained below, EPA chose to select formaldehyde to serve as a surrogate for 
HAP emissions. Formaldehyde is the hazardous air pollutant present in the highest concentration 
from stationary engines. In addition, emissions data show that formaldehyde emission levels are 
related to other HAP emission levels. EPA has previously demonstrated that CO is an 
appropriate surrogate for formaldehyde from stationary CI engines and is consequently finalizing 
emission standards in terms of CO for existing stationary CI RICE at area sources.  
Consistent with stationary CI RICE at major sources, EPA has also divided the stationary 
CI RICE at area sources into emergency and nonemergency engines in order to properly take 
into account the differences between these engines. 
4.2.1.3 Stationary Non-Emergency CI RICE >500 hp at Major Sources 
In addition, EPA is finalizing emission standards for non-emergency stationary CI 
engines greater than 500 hp at major sources under its authority to review and revise emission 
standards as necessary under section 112(d) of the CAA.  
4.2.2 What Are the Pollutants Regulated by this Proposed Rule? 
The final rule regulates emissions of HAP. Available emissions data show that several 
HAP, which are formed during the combustion process or which are contained within the fuel 
burned, are emitted from stationary engines. The HAP which have been measured in emission 
tests conducted on diesel fired RICE include: 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, acrolein, benzene, 
ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, n-hexane, naphthalene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 
polycyclic organic matter, styrene, toluene, and xylene. Metallic HAP from diesel fired 
stationary RICE that have been measured are: cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, 
nickel, and selenium. 
EPA described the health effects of these HAP and other HAP emitted from the operation 
of stationary RICE in the preamble to 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ, published on June 15, 
2004 (69 FR 33474). These HAP emissions are known to cause, or contribute significantly to air 
pollution, which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  More 
details on the health effects of these HAP and other HAP emitted from operation of stationary 
RICE can be found in Section 7 of this RIA.  
The final rule will limit emissions of HAP through emissions standards for CO for 
existing stationary CI RICE. Carbon monoxide has been shown to be an appropriate surrogate 
for HAP emissions from CI engines. For the NESHAP promulgated in 2004, EPA found that 
there is a relationship between CO emissions reductions and HAP emissions reductions from CI 
 4-6 
stationary engines. Therefore, because testing for CO emissions has many advantages over 
testing for HAP emissions, CO emissions were chosen as a surrogate for HAP emissions 
reductions for CI stationary engines. 
For the standards being finalized in this action, EPA believes that previous decisions 
regarding the appropriateness of using CO in concentration (ppm) levels as has been done for 
stationary sources before as surrogates for HAP are still valid.1 Consequently, EPA is finalizing 
emission standards for CO for CI engines in order to regulate HAP emissions. In addition, EPA 
is promulgating separate provisions relevant to emissions of metallic HAP from existing diesel 
engines, as discussed in section III.C. of the preamble. 
In addition to reducing HAP and CO, the final rule will result in the reduction of PM 
emissions from existing diesel engines. The aftertreatment technologies expected to be used to 
reduce HAP and CO emissions also reduce emissions of PM from diesel engines. Also, the final 
rule requires the use of ULSD for diesel-fueled stationary nonemergency CI engines greater than 
300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder. This will result in lower emissions 
of sulfur oxides (SOx) and sulfate particulate from these engines by reducing the sulfur content in 
the fuel.  
4.2.3 What Are the Final Requirements? 
4.2.3.1 Existing Stationary RICE at Major Sources 
The emission requirements that are being finalized in this action for stationary CI RICE 
less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources and stationary nonemergency CI RICE 
greater than 500 hp located at major sources are shown in Table 4-1. The numerical emission 
standards are in units of ppm by volume, dry basis (ppmvd) or percent reduction.   
In addition, certain existing stationary RICE located at major sources are subject to fuel 
requirements. Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency diesel-fueled CI 
engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder located at 
major sources that use diesel fuel must use only diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 
80.510(b). This section requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 parts per 
million (ppm) and either a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 
volume percent.  These fuel requirements are being finalized in order to reduce the potential 
formation of sulfate compounds that are emitted when high sulfur diesel fuel is used in 
                                                 
1In contrast, mobile source emission standards for diesel engines (both nonroad and on-highway) are promulgated 
on a mass basis rather than concentration.  
 4-7 
combination with oxidation catalysts and to assist in the efficient operation of the oxidation 
catalysts.   
EPA is also including work practices in the final rule that will capture and collect 
metallic HAP emissions. Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI engines 
greater than 300 hp located at major sources must do one of the following if the engine is not 
already equipped with a closed crankcase ventilation system:  1) install a closed crankcase 
ventilation system that prevents crankcase emissions from being emitted to the atmosphere, or 2) 
install an open crankcase filtration emission control system that reduces emissions from the 
crankcase by filtering the exhaust stream to remove oil mist, particulates, and metals.

new; or 
• viscosity of the oil has changed by more than 20 percent from the viscosity of the oil 
when new; or 
• percent water content (by volume) is greater than 0.5.  
Pursuant to the provisions of 40 CFR 63.6(g), sources can also request that the Administrator 
approve alternative work practices. 
4.2.3.2 Existing Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
The emission requirements that are being finalized in this action for existing stationary CI 
RICE located at area sources are shown in Table 4-2. Existing stationary emergency engines at 
area sources located at residential, commercial, or institutional facilities are not part of the source 
category and therefore are not subject to any requirements under this final rule. 
 4-9 
Existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE greater than 300 hp located at area sources in 
Alaska not accessible by the Federal Aid Highway System (FAHS) do not have to meet the CO 
emission standards specified in Table 4-2. Existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE greater 
than 300 hp located at area sources in Alaska not accessible by the FAHS must meet the 
maintenance practices that are shown for stationary nonemergency CI RICE less than or equal to 
300 hp in Table 4-2. 
Also, owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency diesel-fueled CI engines 
greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder located at area sources 
that use diesel fuel must use only diesel fuel meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 80.510(b). This 
section requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur content of 15 ppm and either a minimum 
cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 35 volume percent. Finally, in order to 
reduce metallic HAP emissions, existing stationary nonemergency CI engines greater than 300 
hp located at area sources must do one of the following if the engine is not already equipped with 
a closed crankcase ventilation system:  1) install a closed crankcase ventilation system that 
prevents crankcase emissions from being emitted to the atmosphere, or 2) install an open 
crankcase filtration emission control system that reduces emissions from the crankcase by 
filtering the exhaust stream to remove oil mist, particulates, and metals.

must be based on specific factual information indicating the reason that a longer period is necessary for that 
engine.  
 
4.2.3.3 Operating Limitations for Nonemergency CI Engines >500 hp  
In addition to the standards discussed above, EPA is finalizing operating limitations for 
stationary nonemergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp. Owners and operators of engines 
that are equipped with oxidation catalyst must maintain the catalyst so that the pressure drop 
across the catalyst does not change by more than 2 inches of water from the pressure drop across 
the catalyst that was measured during the initial performance test. Owners and operators of these 
engines must also maintain the temperature of the stationary RICE exhaust so that the catalyst 
inlet temperature is between 450 and 1350 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) for engines with an oxidation 
catalyst. Owners and operators of engines that are not using oxidation catalyst must comply with 
any operating limitations approved by the Administrator.  
4.2.3.4 Startup Requirements 
As shown in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, the following stationary engines are subject to specific 
operational standards, during engine startup:  
 Existing CI RICE less than or equal to 500 hp located at major sources, 
 Existing nonemergency CI RICE greater than 500 hp located at major sources, 
 Existing CI RICE located at area sources,  
 New or reconstructed nonemergency 2SLB >500 hp located at a major source of HAP 
emissions, 
 4-11 
 New or reconstructed nonemergency 4SLB >500 hp located at a major source of HAP 
emissions, 
 Existing nonemergency 4SRB >500 hp located at a major source of HAP emissions, 
 New or reconstructed nonemergency 4SRB >500 hp located at a major source of 
HAP emissions, and 
 New or reconstructed nonemergency CI >500 hp located at a major source of HAP 
emissions. 
Engine startup is defined as the time from initial start until applied load and engine and 
associated equipment reaches steady state or normal operation. For stationary engine with 
catalytic controls, engine startup means the time from initial start until applied load and engine 
and associated equipment reaches steady state, or normal operation, including the catalyst. 
Owners and operators must minimize the engine’s time spent at idle and limit startup time to 30 
minutes. These requirements will limit the HAP emissions during periods of engine startup. 
Pursuant to the provisions of 40 CFR 63.6(g), engines at major sources may petition the 
Administrator for an alternative work practice.  An owner or operator of an engine at an area 
source can work with its state permitting authority pursuant to EPA’s regulations at 40 CFR 
subpart E for approval of an alternative management practice.  See 40 C.F.R. Subpart E (setting 
forth requirements for, among other things, equivalency by permit, rule substitution). 
What Are the Operating Limitations? 
In addition to the standards discussed above, EPA is finalizing operating limitations for 
stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 HP.  Owners and operators of 
engines that are equipped with oxidation catalyst must maintain the catalyst so that the pressure 
drop across the catalyst does not change by more than 2 inches of water from the pressure drop 
across the catalyst that was measured during the initial performance test.  Owners and operators 
of these engines must also maintain the temperature of the stationary RICE exhaust so that the 
catalyst inlet temperature is between 450 and 1350 degrees Fahrenheit (°F).  Owners and 
operators may petition for a different temperature range; the petition must demonstrate why it is 
operationally necessary and appropriate to operate below the temperature range specified in the 
rule (see 40 CFR 63.8(f)).  Owners and operators of engines that are not using oxidation catalyst 
must comply with any operating limitations approved by the Administrator. 
 Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI engines greater than 300 
HP meeting the requirement to use open or closed crankcases must follow the manufacturer’s 
 4-12 
specified maintenance requirements for operating and maintaining the open or closed crankcase 
ventilation systems and replacing the crankcase filters, or can request the Administrator to 
approve different maintenance requirements that are as protective as manufacturer requirements. 
4.2.3.5 Fuel Requirements 
In addition to emission standards and management practices, certain stationary CI RICE 
located at existing area sources are subject to fuel requirements. These fuel requirements are 
being finalized in order to reduce the potential formation of sulfate compounds that are emitted 
when high sulfur diesel fuel is used in combination with oxidation catalysts and to assist in the 
efficient operation of the oxidation catalysts. Thus, owners and operators of stationary 
nonemergency diesel-fueled CI engines greater than 300 hp with a displacement of less than 30 
liters per cylinder located at existing area sources must only use diesel fuel meeting the 
requirements of 40 CFR 80.510(b), which requires that diesel fuel have a maximum sulfur 
content of 15 ppm and either a minimum cetane index of 40 or a maximum aromatic content of 
35 volume percent.  
4.2.4 What Are the Requirements for Demonstrating Compliance? 
The following sections describe the requirements for demonstrating compliance under the 
final rule. 
4.2.4.1 Existing Stationary CI RICE at Major Sources  
Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE located at major 
sources that are less than 100 hp and stationary emergency CI RICE located at major sources 
must operate and maintain their stationary RICE and after-treatment control device (if any) 
according to the manufacturer’s emission-related written instructions or develop their own 
maintenance plan. Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE located 
at major sources that are less than 100 hp and existing stationary emergency CI RICE located at 
major sources do not have to conduct any performance testing because they are not subject to 
numerical emission standards. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE located at major 
sources that are greater than or equal to 100 hp and less than or equal to 500 hp must conduct an 
initial performance test to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards.  
Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE greater than 500 hp 
located at major sources must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 8,760 hours 
 4-13 
of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are achieving the 
required emission standards.  
Owners and operators of stationary nonemergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 hp 
and are located at a major source must continuously monitor and record the catalyst inlet 
temperature if an oxidation catalyst is being used on the engine. The pressure drop across the 
catalyst must also be measured monthly. If an oxidation catalyst is not being used on the engine, 
the owner or operator must continuously monitor and record the operating parameters (if any) 
approved by the Administrator. 
4.2.4.2 Existing Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE located at area sources that are subject 
to management practices, as shown in Table 4-2, must develop a maintenance plan that specifies 
how the management practices will be met. Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE 
that are subject to management practices do not have to conduct any performance testing.  
Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE greater than 300 hp 
that are located at area sources must conduct an initial performance test to demonstrate that they 
are achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency RICE that are greater than 
500 hp and located at area sources must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 
8,760 hours of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are 
achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary nonemergency CI RICE that are greater than 
500 hp and are located at an area source must continuously monitor and record the catalyst inlet 
temperature if an oxidation catalyst is being used on the engine. The pressure drop across the 
catalyst must also be measured monthly. If an oxidation catalyst is not being used on the engine, 
the owner or operator must continuously monitor and record the operating parameters (if any) 
approved by the Administrator. 
On October 9, 2008 (73 FR 59956), EPA proposed performance specification 
requirements for continuous parametric monitoring systems (CPMS).  Currently there are no 
performance specifications for the CPMS that are required for continuously monitoring the 
catalyst inlet temperature.  The timetable for finalizing the proposed performance specification 
requirements is uncertain; therefore, EPA plans to finalize performance specification 
 4-14 
requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart ZZZZ for the CPMS systems used for continuous 
catalyst inlet temperature monitoring when the final requirements are promulgated for existing SI 
engines in August 2010.          
2.  Existing Stationary RICE at Area Sources 
Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE located at area sources that are subject 
to management practices, as shown in Table 4-2, must develop a maintenance plan that specifies 
how the management practices will be met.  Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE 
that are subject to management practices do not have to conduct any performance testing.  
Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 
300 HP and located at area sources and are not limited use stationary RICE must conduct an 
initial performance test to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 500 
HP and located at area sources and are limited use stationary RICE must conduct an initial 
performance test and must test every 8,760 hours of operation or 5 years, whichever comes first, 
to demonstrate that they are achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency RICE that are greater than 
500 HP and located at area sources must conduct an initial performance test and must test every 
8,760 hours of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first, to demonstrate that they are 
achieving the required emission standards. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI RICE that are greater than 
500 HP and are located at an area source must continuously monitor and record the catalyst inlet 
temperature if an oxidation catalyst is being used on the engine.  The pressure drop across the 
catalyst must also be measured monthly.  If an oxidation catalyst is not being used on the engine, 
the owner or operator must continuously monitor and record the operating parameters (if any) 
approved by the Administrator. 
4.2.5 What Are the Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements? 
The following sections describe the reporting and recordkeeping requirements that are 
required under the final rule. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary emergency RICE that do not meet the 
requirements for nonemergency engines are required to keep records of their hours of operation. 
Owners and operators of existing stationary emergency RICE must install a non-resettable hour 
 4-15 
meter on their engines to record the necessary information. The information must include how 
many hours are spent for emergency operation, including what classified the operation as 
emergency and how many hours are spent for nonemergency operation. 
Emergency stationary RICE may be operated for the purpose of maintenance checks and 
readiness testing, provided that the tests are recommended by the Federal, State or local 
government, the manufacturer, the vendor, or the insurance company associated with the engine. 
Maintenance checks and readiness testing of such units are limited to 100 hours per year. Owners 
and operators can petition the Administrator for additional hours, beyond the allowed 100 hours 
per year, if such additional hours should prove to be necessary for maintenance and testing 
reasons. A petition is not required if the engine is mandated by regulation such as State or local 
requirements to run more than 100 hours per year for maintenance and testing purposes. There is 
no time limit on the use of emergency stationary engines in emergency situations; however, the 
owner or operator is required to record the length of operation and the reason the engine was in 
operation during that time. Records must be maintained documenting why the engine was 
operating to ensure the 100 hours per year limit for maintenance and testing operation is not 
exceeded. In addition, owners and operators are allowed to operate their stationary emergency 
RICE for nonemergency purposes for 50 hours per year, but those 50 hours are counted towards 
the total 100 hours provided for operation other than for true emergencies and owners and 
operators may not engage in income-generating activities during those 50 hours. The 50 hours 
per year for nonemergency purposes cannot be used to generate income for a facility, for 
example, to supply power to an electric grid or otherwise supply power as part of a financial 
arrangement with another entity. However, owners and operators may operate the emergency 
engine for a maximum of 15 hours per year as part of an emergency demand response program if 
the utility distribution company has determined that a blackout is imminent. The engine 
operation must be terminated immediately after the utility distribution company advises that a 
blackout is no longer imminent. The 15 hours per year of emergency demand response operation 
are counted as part of the 50 hours of operation per year provided for nonemergency situations. 
Owners and operators must keep records showing how they were notified of the emergency 
condition and by whom, and the time that the engine was operated as part of demand response.        
Owners and operators of existing stationary RICE located at area sources that are subject 
to management practices as shown in Table 4-2, are required to keep records that show that 
management practices that are required are being met. These records must include, at a 
minimum: oil and filter change dates, oil amounts added and corresponding hour on the hour 
 4-16 
meter, fuel consumption rates, air filter (if applicable) change dates, records of repairs and other 
maintenance performed. 
Owners and operators of existing non-emergency stationary CI RICE greater than 300 HP 
must keep records of the manufacturer’s recommended maintenance procedures for the closed 
crankcase ventilation system or open crankcase filtration system and records of the maintenance 
performed on the system.  
In terms of reporting requirements, owners and operators of existing stationary RICE, 
except stationary RICE that are less than 100 hp, existing emergency stationary RICE, and 
existing stationary RICE that are not subject to numerical emission standards, must submit all of 
the applicable notifications as listed in the NESHAP General Provisions (40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A), including an initial notification, notification of performance test, and a notification of 
compliance for each stationary RICE which must comply with the specified emission limitations. 
4.3 Summary of Significant Changes Since Proposal 
Most of the rationale used to develop the proposed rule remains the same for the final 
rule. Therefore, the rationale previously provided in the preamble to the proposed rule is not 
repeated in the final rule, and the rationale sections of the rule, as proposed, should be referred 
to. Major changes that have been made to the rule since proposal are discussed in this section 
with rationale following in the Summary of Responses to Comments report that is in the docket 
for this rulemaking. 
4.3.1 Applicability 
EPA proposed to regulate HAP emissions from existing stationary engines less than or 
equal to 500 hp located at major sources and all existing stationary engines located at area 
sources. EPA also proposed NESHAP for existing stationary CI engines greater than 500 hp that 
are located at major sources. 
In the final rule, EPA is only regulating HAP emissions from existing stationary CI 
engines. EPA will address HAP emissions from existing stationary SI engines in a separate 
rulemaking later this year. 
Another change from the proposal is that the final rule is not applicable to existing 
stationary emergency engines at area sources that are located at residential, commercial, or 
institutional facilities. These engines are not subject to any requirements under the final rule 
because they are not part of the regulated source category. EPA has found that existing 
 4-17 
emergency engines located at residential, commercial, and institutional facilities were not 
included in the original Urban Air Toxics Strategy inventory and were not included in the listing 
of urban area sources. More information on this issue can be found in the memorandum entitled 
“Analysis of the Types of Engines Used to Estimate the CAA Section 112(k) Area Source 
Inventory for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines,” available from the 
rulemaking docket. 
4.3.2 Final Emission Limits 
4.3.2.1 Existing Stationary CI Engines <100 hp Located at Major Sources  
For the proposed rule, EPA required existing stationary engines less than 50 hp that are 
located at major sources to meet a formaldehyde emission standard that was based on the levels 
achievable without aftertreatment. Based on comments received including the feasibility of being 
able to achieve the proposed emission standard and being able to measure formaldehyde 
emissions of that magnitude, EPA is not finalizing a formaldehyde emission standard for this 
group of engines. In addition, in light of several comments asserting that the cutoff for requiring 
emission standards for engines less than 50 hp at major sources was inappropriate, EPA is 
finalizing a threshold of 100 hp.  
In the proposed rule, existing stationary CI engines less than 100 HP located at major 
sources were required to meet a 40 ppmvd CO at 15 percent oxygen (O2) standard.  In the final 
rule, all existing stationary CI engines less than 100 HP located at major sources must meet work 
practices.  These work practices are described in section III.C. of the preamble.  EPA believes 
that work practices are appropriate and justified for this group of stationary engines because the 
application of measurement methodology is not practicable due to technological and economic 
limitations.  Further information on EPA’s decision can be found in the memorandum entitled 
“MACT Floor Determination for Existing Stationary Non-Emergency CI RICE Less Than 100 
HP and Existing Stationary Emergency CI RICE Located at Major Sources and GACT for 
Existing Stationary CI RICE Located at Area Sources,” which is available from the rulemaking 
docket.   
4.3.2.2 Existing Stationary Nonemergency CI Engines 100≤hp≤300 Located at Major Sources 
EPA is finalizing a CO emission standard for existing nonemergency CI engines greater 
than or equal to 100 hp and less than or equal to 300 hp located at major sources based on levels 
achieved without add-on control. All existing stationary CI engines less than or equal to 300 hp 
located at major sources must meet a 157 ppmvd CO at 15 percent O2 standard. EPA revised the 
proposed CO standard for this group of engines based on additional information received after 
 4-18 
the proposal, which led to a reevaluation of the MACT floor for these engines. A discussion of 
the final MACT floor determination can be found in the memo entitled “Subcategorization and 
MACT Floor Determination for Existing Stationary CI Reciprocating Internal Combustion 
Engines at Major Sources,” which is available from the rulemaking docket. All existing 
stationary CI engines less than or equal to 300 hp located at area sources, both emergency and 
nonemergency, are subject to management practice standards under the final rule, as was 
proposed.  
4.3.2.3 Existing Stationary Nonemergency CI Engines >300 hp  
EPA proposed that existing stationary nonemergency CI engines greater than 300 hp 
meet a 4 ppmvd at 15 percent O2 CO standard or a 90 percent CO reduction standard. Numerous 
commenters indicated that EPA’s dataset was insufficient and urged EPA to gather more data to 
obtain a more complete representation of emissions from existing stationary CI engines. 
Commenters also questioned the emission standard setting approach that EPA used at proposal 
and claimed that the proposed standards did not take into account emissions variability and may 
not be achievable. For the final rule EPA has obtained additional test data for existing stationary 
CI engines and has included this additional in the MACT floor analysis. EPA is also using an 
approach that better considers emissions variability as well. 
In the final rule, EPA is providing owners and operators the option of meeting either a 
CO concentration or a CO percent reduction standard.  Owners and operators of existing 
stationary non-emergency CI engines greater than 300 HP and less than or equal to 500 HP 
located at major and area sources must either reduce CO emissions by at least 70 percent or limit 
the concentration of CO in the engine exhaust to 49 ppmvd, at 15 percent O2.  Owners and 
operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI engines greater than 500 HP located at major 
and area sources must either reduce CO emissions by at least 70 percent or limit the 
concentration of CO in the engine exhaust to 23 ppmvd, at 15 percent O2.  EPA’s review of the 
data indicate that it is appropriate to base the MACT standard on a reduction level of 70 percent, 
which takes into account the variability of the emission reduction efficiency of aftertreatment 
under various operational conditions.  
4.3.2.4 Existing Stationary Emergency CI Engines 100≤hp≤500 Located at Major Sources 
For existing stationary emergency engines located at major sources, we proposed that 
these engines be subject to a 40 ppmvd CO at 15 percent O2 standard.  In the final rule, existing 
stationary emergency CI engines greater than or equal to 100 HP and less than or equal to 500 
HP and located at major sources must meet work practices.  These work practices are described 
 4-19 
in section III.C. of the preamble.  EPA believes that work practices are appropriate and justified 
for this group of stationary engines because the application of measurement methodology is not 
practicable due to technological and economic limitations.  Further information on EPA’s 
decision can be found in the memorandum entitled “MACT Floor Determination for Existing 
Stationary Non-Emergency CI RICE Less Than 100 HP and Existing Stationary Emergency CI 
RICE Located at Major Sources and GACT for Existing Stationary CI RICE Located at Area 
Sources,” which is available from the rulemaking docket. 
4.3.2.5 Existing Stationary Emergency CI Engines >500 hp Located at Area Sources  
For existing stationary emergency engines located at area sources, EPA reevaluated the 
information available for emergency engines and considered extensive input received from 
industry and other groups who asserted that the proposed standards were not GACT for 
emergency engines at area sources. 
In the final rule, all existing stationary emergency CI engines located at area sources must 
meet management practice standards.  
4.3.3 Management Practices 
EPA proposed management practices for several subcategories of engines located at area 
sources. EPA explained that the proposed management practices would be expected to ensure 
that emission control systems are working properly and would help minimize HAP emissions 
from the engines. EPA proposed specific maintenance practices and asked for comments on the 
need and appropriateness for those procedures. Based on feedback received during the public 
comment period, which included information submitted in comment letters and additional 
information EPA specifically asked for following the close of the comment period from different 
industry groups, EPA is finalizing management practices for existing stationary nonemergency 
CI engines less than or equal to 300 hp located at area sources and all existing emergency 
stationary CI engines located at area sources.  
Existing stationary nonemergency CI engines less than or equal to 300 hp located at area 
sources are required to change the oil and filter every 1,000 hours of operation or annually, 
whichever comes first, inspect air cleaner every 1,000 hours of operation or annually, whichever 
comes first, and inspect all hoses and belts every 500 hours of operation or annually, whichever 
comes first, and replace as necessary. EPA is adding an option for sources to use an oil change 
analysis program to extend the oil change frequencies specified above.  The analysis program 
must at a minimum analyze the following three parameters:  Total Base Number, viscosity, and 
percent water content.  If any of the limits below are exceeded, the engine owner or operator 
 4-20 
must change the oil before continuing to operate the engine.  The condemning limits are as 
follows:  
• Total Base Number is less than 30 percent of the Total Base Number of the oil when 
new; or 
• viscosity of the oil has changed by more than 20 percent from the viscosity of the oil 
when new; or 
• percent water content (by volume) is greater than 0.5.  
Owners and operators of all engines subject to management practices also have the option work 
with state permitting authorities pursuant to EPA’s regulations at 40 CFR subpart E for 
alternative maintenance practices to be used instead of the specific maintenance practices 
promulgated in this rule.  The maintenance practices must be at least as stringent as those 
specified in the final rule. 
The final rule specifies that in situations where an emergency engine is operating during 
an emergency and it is not possible to shut down the engine in order to perform the work or 
management practice requirements on the schedule required in the final rule, or if performing the 
work or management practice on the required schedule would otherwise pose an unacceptable 
risk under federal, state, or local law, the maintenance activity can be delayed until the 
emergency is over or the unacceptable risk under federal, state, or local law has abated.  The 
maintenance should be performed as soon as practicable after the emergency has ended or the 
unacceptable risk under federal, state, or local law has abated.  Sources must report any failure to 
perform the work practice on the schedule required and the federal, state or local law under 
which the risk was deemed unacceptable. 
4.3.3.1 Startup, Shutdown and Malfunction 
EPA proposed formaldehyde and CO emission standards for existing stationary engines 
at major sources to apply during periods of startup and malfunction.  EPA also proposed certain 
standards for existing stationary engines at area sources that would apply during startup and 
malfunction.  Based on various comments and concerns with the proposed emission standards for 
periods of startup, EPA has determined that it is not feasible to finalize numerical emission 
standards that would apply during startup because the application of measurement methodology 
to this operation is not practicable due to technological and economic limitations.  As a result, 
EPA is promulgating operational standards during startup that specify that owners and operators 
 4-21 
must limit the engine startup time to no more than 30 minutes and must minimize the engine’s 
time spent at idle during startup.  Based on information reviewed by EPA, engine startup 
typically requires no more than 30 minutes.  We received comments indicating that there are 
conditions where it may take more than 30 minutes to startup the engine, for example for cold 
starts or where the ambient conditions are very cold.  However, commenters did not provide 
enough specificity in their comments, nor did commenters provide data, to determine whether 
any scenarios were appropriate to allow a longer startup period.  Owners and operators of 
engines at major sources have the option to petition the Administrator pursuant to 40 CFR 
63.6(g) for alternative work practices.  Any petition must be based on specific factual 
information indicating the reason the alternative work practice is necessary for that engine and is 
no less stringent than start-up requirements in the rule.  An owner or operator of an engine at an 
area source can work with its state permitting authority pursuant to EPA’s regulations at 40 CFR 
subpart E for approval of an alternative management practice, based on specific factual 
information indicating the reason that a longer period is necessary for that engine.  Such 
alternative management practice must be demonstrated to be no less stringent than EPA 
promulgated standards.    
As discussed further below, EPA is not setting separate standards for malfunctions in this 
rule.  Therefore, the standards that apply during normal operation also apply during malfunction.  
EPA believes that any emissions occurring during a malfunction would be of such a short 
duration compared to the emissions averaged during overall testing time (three one-hour runs) 
that the engine would still be able to comply with the emission standard.  In addition, EPA does 
not view malfunction as a distinct operating mode and, therefore, any emissions that occur at 
such times do not need to be taken into account in setting CAA section 112(d) standards.  
Further, as is explained in more detail in Section V.D. of the preamble, even if malfunctions 
were considered a distinct operating mode, we believe it would be impracticable to take into 
account malfunctions in setting CAA section 112(d) standards.   
4.3.3.2 Other 
EPA is including an additional requirement in the final rule that will reduce metallic HAP 
emissions.  Owners and operators of existing stationary non-emergency CI engines greater than 
300 HP must do one of the following if the engine is not already equipped with a closed 
crankcase ventilation system:  1) install a closed crankcase ventilation system that prevents 
crankcase emissions from being emitted to the atmosphere, or 2) install an open crankcase 
filtration emission control system that reduces the crankcase emissions by filtering the exhaust 
stream to remove oil mist, particulates, and metals.  Owners and operators must follow the 
 4-22 
manufacturer’s specified maintenance requirements for operating and maintaining the open or 
closed crankcase ventilation systems and replacing the crankcase filters, or can request the 
Administrator to approve different maintenance requirements that are as protective as 
manufacturer requirements. 
EPA is including special provisions in the final rule for existing stationary non-
emergency CI RICE greater than 300 HP located at area sources in Alaska not accessible by the 
FAHS.  Owners and operators of these engines do not have to meet the CO emission standards 
specified in Table 4-2, but must instead meet the management practices that are described for 
stationary non-emergency CI RICE less than or equal to 300 HP in section III.C. of the 
preamble. 
The final rule specifies that stationary CI engines that are used to startup combustion 
turbines should meet the same requirements as stationary emergency CI engines. 
 
4.4 Cost Impacts 
4.4.1 Introduction 
The cost impacts associated with the final rule consist of different types of costs, which 
include the annual and capital costs of controls, costs associated with keeping records of 
information necessary to demonstrate compliance, costs associated with reporting requirements 
under the General Provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, costs of purchasing and operating 
equipment associated with continuous parametric monitoring, and the cost of conducting 
performance testing to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards. The capital and 
annual costs presented in this section are calculated based on the control cost methodology 
presented in the EPA (2002) Air Pollution Control Cost Manual prepared by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency.2 This methodology sets out a procedure by which capital and 
annualized costs are defined and estimated, and this procedure is often used to estimate the costs 
of rulemakings such as this one. The capital costs presented in this section are annualized using a 
7% interest rate, a rate that is consistent with the guidance provided in the Office of Management 
and Budget’s (OMB’s) (2003) Circular A-4.3  The following sections describe how the various 
cost elements were estimated.

 4-23 
4.4.1.1 Control Costs 
For engines that will need to add control technology to meet the emission standards, the 
following equations were used to estimate capital and annual control costs as shown in Table 4-
3: 
Table 4-3: CI RICE Control Technologies and Costs 
Technology Capital Cost ($2008) Annual Cost ($2008) 
Diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) $27.4 x hp − $939 $4.99 x hp + $480 
Open crankcase ventilation (OCV) $0.26 x hp + $997 $0.065 x hp + $254 
 
The control costs for DOC were calculated using cost data obtained from a California Air 
Resources Board (CARB) study.4 The study provided cost ranges for diesel engines ranging from 
40 hp to 1400 hp. The average cost from the range was selected and was adjusted to 2008 
dollars. The capital and annual cost were calculated using maintenance data from the CARB 
study and cost assumptions from the EPA Air Pollution Control Cost Manual. The control costs 
for the OCV system were calculated using 2008 cost data obtained from a diesel engine 
equipment vendor. An equipment life of 10 years was used to calculate the capital recovery 
factor (CRF) for developing the annual cost for each of the control devices. A linear regression 
equation was developed for the capital cost of the DOC and OCV using the capital cost data and 
the engine size in horsepower (hp). This approach was used to develop a linear regression 
equation for annual cost. 
4.4.1.2 Recordkeeping 
No recordkeeping costs were attributed to the requirement of following the 
manufacturer’s emission-related operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements or the owner 
or operator’s own maintenance plan. It is expected that the majority of owners and operators are 
already following some type of O&M requirements and minimal to no additional burden is 
expected. Labor costs associated with recording the hours of operation of emergency engines are 
based on a technical labor rate of $68 per hour which was obtained from the Department of 
Labor Statistics web site.5 The final total wage rate was based on the 2005 compensation rates 
for professional staff and adjusted by an overhead and profit rate of 167 percent. The year 2005 
was used for consistency in order to have the same basis for all costs. All costs were later 
converted to 2008 dollars for purposes of presenting costs associated with the rule in present day

terms. One hour per year is expected to be sufficient to record hours of operation for stationary 
emergency engines. No cost is attributed to purchasing and installing an hour-meter since the 
majority of stationary engines already come equipped with such equipment. For owner/operators 
of nonemergency CI engines, EPA assumed that one hour per year was sufficient for 
recordkeeping for these engines. 
4.4.1.3 Reporting 
Most engines affected by this rule will be subject to reporting requirements such as 
reading instructions, training personnel, submitting an initial notification, submitting a 
notification of performance test(s), and submitting a compliance report. .  However, owners and 
operators of engines less than 100 HP, existing stationary emergency engines, and existing 
stationary engines less than 300 HP located at area sources are not subject to any specific 
reporting requirements.  . For stationary non-emergency limited use CI engines that operate less 
than 100 hours per year, EPA is finalizing less burdensome reporting requirements by requiring 
these engines to submit compliance reports on an annual basis, as opposed to semiannually as is 
required for other engines subject to numerical emission limitations.  The reporting requirements 
are based on $68 per hour for technical labor to comply with the reporting requirements. It is 
estimated that a total of 14 hours will be needed, and 13 hours for limited use engines. 
4.4.1.4 Monitoring 
The cost of monitoring includes the purchase of a continuous parametric monitoring 
system (CPMS). Nonemergency engines greater than 500 hp that have add-on controls are 
required to use a CPMS to monitor the catalyst inlet temperature and pressure drop across the 
catalyst to ensure those parameters do not exceed the operating limitations. The cost of 
purchasing and operating a CPMS was obtained from vendor quotes received for previous 
rulemaking and adjusted to 2008 dollars.6 The capital cost of a CPMS for a large engine facility 
is $531. It is estimated that 30 hours per year is necessary to operate and maintain the CPMS and 
that 6 hours per year (or 0.5 hours per month) is needed to record information from the CPMS. It 
is assumed that all engines subject to continuous monitoring would be located at large engine 
facilities.  
4.4.1.5 Performance Testing 
Initial performance testing is required for nonemergency engines greater than 100 hp at 
major sources and nonemergency engines greater than 300 hp located at area sources. The cost of

 4-25 
conducting a performance test on a CI engine is based on cost information gathered for previous 
rulemakings.7 The performance testing cost is based the use of a portable analyzer and was 
estimated to cost $1,000 per day of testing. This daily performance test cost was adjusted to 2008 
dollars and was estimated to be $1,165. Because the regulation requires three-1 hour runs, EPA 
assumed that two engines could be tested at each facility in one day. Therefore, the estimated 
impacts performance testing cost will be assumed to be $583 per engine (or half of the $1,165 
daily cost) using a portable analyzer. 
4.4.1.6 Work Practices 
The costs for performing work practices for CI engines less than 100 hp located at a 
major source was assumed to be negligible and were not included in these impact calculations. 
The work practices are based on engine maintenance procedures that the owner/operators 
perform regardless of the regulation. These work practices include: 
 Changing the oil and filter; 
 Inspecting the air cleaner;  
 Inspecting all hoses and belts, and replacing as necessary. 
EPA believes that these work practices will limit HAP emissions from these engines, 
because these work practices ensure that the engine is operating efficiently. Owner/operators of 
these engines regularly perform these work practices as part of the preventive maintenance 
schedule for the engine. Therefore, EPA believes that it is appropriate to not include these work 
practice costs in the impacts determination. 
4.4.1.7 Management Practices 
The costs for performing management practices for nonemergency CI engines less than 
or equal to 300 hp located at area sources and all emergency engines located at area sources was 
assumed to be negligible and were not included in these impact calculations. The management 
practices are based on engine maintenance procedures that the owner/operators perform 
regardless of the regulation. These management practices include: 
 Changing the oil and filter; 
 Inspecting the air cleaner; and  
 Inspecting all hoses and belts, and replacing as necessary.

EPA believes that these work practices will limit HAP emissions from these engines, 
because these work practices ensure that the engine is operating efficiently. Owner/operators of 
these engines regularly perform these work practices as part of the preventive maintenance 
schedule for the engine. Therefore, EPA believes that it is appropriate to not include these work 
practice costs in the impacts determination. 
4.4.2 Major Sources 
The cost impacts for stationary RICE vary depending on the engine type and size. The 
following sections describe the specific costs that apply to each subcategory of CI engines 
located at major sources. 
4.4.2.1 All CI Engines hp < 100 
The costs associated with CI engines less than 100 hp include minimal requirements. 
Owners and operators of engines less than 100 hp are required to follow the manufacturer’s 
emission-related O&M requirements or must develop their own maintenance plan to follow. 
Emergency engines must record the hours of operation, which is estimated at one hour per year 
at $72 per hour.  
4.4.2.2 Nonemergency CI Engines 100 ≤ hp ≤ 300 hp  
The costs associated with nonemergency CI engines greater than or equal to 100 hp and 
less than or equal to 300 hp include the cost of an initial test, recordkeeping, and reporting. In 
addition, EPA assumes that some of these engines will be required to install a control device to 
meet the emissions standard. To estimate the number of CI engines that would be required to 
install control technology, EPA compared the emission rate of the test that was used to determine 
the MACT floor with the CI nonroad emission factors.8 EPA found that only the emission factors 
for Tier 0 CI engines were greater than the 1.2 g/hp-hr value that was used to set the MACT 
floor. Therefore, it was assumed that Tier 1 engines and greater would be able to meet the final 
emission standard. The model year for Tier 1 engines begins in 1997 for 100 to 175 CI engines, 
and 1996 for 175 to 300 hp CI engines. Using the model year data in the population 
memorandum, EPA estimated that 35 percent of the existing CI engines greater than or equal to 
100 hp and less than or equal to 300 hp are Tier 0 engines and would need to install control 
technology to meet the emission standard. The cost estimates for this subcategory of engines do 
not account for possible fuel price increases that may result from using ultra-low sulfur diesel 
(ULSD). EPA estimated the cost of lubricity additives to ULSD would increase the cost of the

fuel by 0.2 cents per gallon,9 which EPA believes is negligible. In addition, there are no 
additional maintenance requirements for owner/operators using ULSD in existing diesel engines. 
Many owner/operators have found that time between oil changes can be extended for engines 
using ULSD fuel, which would decrease the overall cost of switching to ULSD fuel. Therefore, 
EPA believes that it is appropriate to not include any costs for switching to ULSD in the impacts 
for this NESHAP. 
4.4.2.2 Nonemergency CI Engines > 300 hp 
The costs associated with nonemergency CI engines above 300 hp include the cost of 
installing and operating an oxidation catalyst for reducing HAP, as well as the cost of installing 
an open crankcase ventilation system. Nonemergency CI engines greater than 500 hp are also 
subject to continuous monitoring requirements. In addition, owners and operators must conduct 
an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation. Owners and 
operators of engines above 500 hp must conduct subsequent performance testing every 8,760 
hours or 3 years, whichever comes first to demonstrate compliance. The cost estimates for this 
subcategory of engines do not account for possible fuel price increases that may result from 
using ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD). EPA estimated the cost of lubricity additives to ULSD 
would increase the cost of the fuel by 0.2 cents per gallon,10 which EPA believes is negligible. In 
addition, there are no additional maintenance requirements for owner/operators using ULSD in 
existing diesel engines. Many owner/operators have found that time between oil changes can be 
extended for engines using ULSD fuel, which would decrease the overall cost of switching to 
ULSD fuel. Therefore, EPA believes that it is appropriate to not include any costs for switching 
to ULSD in the impacts for this NESHAP.  
4.4.2.3 Emergency CI Engines  
The costs associated with emergency CI engines greater than 300 hp and less than or 
equal to 500 hp (emergency CI engines above 500 hp were subject to an earlier rule and are not 
subject to further regulation in this rule) include minimal recordkeeping requirements. The 
owners and operators must follow the manufacturer’s emission-related operating and 
maintenance (O&M) requirements or must develop their own maintenance plan to follow and 
must also keep records of the hours of operation. It is estimated that one hour per year at $68 per 
hour would be sufficient to record the hours of operation. No costs were included in the impacts

for following the manufacturer’s emission-related O&M plan, because it is expected that 
owner/operators will follow this plan regardless of the regulation.  
4.4.3 Area Sources 
4.4.3.1 All Emergency CI Engines 
The costs associated with emergency CI engines include recordkeeping requirements for 
tracking the hours of operation, but these engines are not subject to any performance testing. The 
owners and operators must follow the manufacturer’s emission-related O&M requirements or 
must develop their own maintenance plan to follow. It is estimated that one hour per year at $68 
per hour would be sufficient to record the hours of operation. Emergency CI engines at areas 
sources will be subject to management practices, rather numerical emission limits. The 
management practices do not require aftertreatment controls. Therefore, no control costs have 
been estimated for these engines. These engines will be subject to management practices which 
are not included in the costs, because it is assumed that these management practices are 
performed regardless of the regulation. 
4.4.3.2 Nonemergency CI Engines ≤ 300 hp 
The costs associated with nonemergency CI engines less than or equal to 300 hp are 
minimal and only include following the manufacturer’s emission-related O&M requirements or 
the owner or operator’s own maintenance plan. These engines are not subject to any numerical 
emission limitations, therefore no control costs apply and no performance testing is required. 
These engines will be subject to management practices which are not included in the costs, 
because it is assumed that these management practices are done regardless of the regulation. 
4.4.3.3 Nonemergency CI Engines > 300 hp 
The costs associated with nonemergency CI engines above 300 hp include the cost of 
installing and operating an oxidation catalyst for reducing HAP, as well as the cost of installing 
an open crankcase ventilation system. Nonemergency CI engines greater than 500 hp are also 
subject to continuous monitoring requirements. In addition, owners and operators must conduct 
an initial performance test to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation and engines 
above 500 hp must conduct subsequent performance testing every 8,760 hours or 3 years, 
whichever comes first. The cost estimates for this subcategory of engines do not account for 
possible fuel price increases that may result from using ultra-low sulfur diesel. The cost 
estimates for this subcategory of engines do not account for possible fuel price increases that 
may result from using ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD). EPA estimated the cost of lubricity 
additives to ULSD would increase the cost of the fuel by 0.2 cents per gallon, which EPA 
 4-29 
believes is negligible. In addition, there are no additional maintenance requirements for 
owner/operators using ULSD in existing diesel engines. Many owner/operators have found that 
time between oil changes can be extended for engines using ULSD fuel, which would decrease 
the overall cost of switching to ULSD fuel. Therefore, EPA believes that it is appropriate to not 
include any costs for switching to ULSD in the impacts for this NESHAP. 
A summary of the total costs associated with the rule by major source and area source 
categories is found in Table 4-4.  A summary of the costs by NAICS codes is found in Table 4-5.  
Table 4-6 provides a summary of costs by engine size, and a presentation of the number of 
engines by engine size is in Table 4-7.   All cost estimates are from “Impacts Associated with

4.5  Emissions and Emission Reductions 
The emissions reductions associated with the final rule are based on requiring emission 
standards that are based on applying add-on controls to non-emergency CI engines greater than 
300 HP.  Baseline emissions from the current population of stationary RICE less than or equal to 
500 HP at major sources and existing stationary RICE at area sources were calculated based on 
non-emergency CI engines operating 1,000 hrs/yr, and emergency CI engines operating 50 
hrs/yr.  The following additional assumptions were used: 
 
 
Emission Factors: 
Engine HAP  
(lb/hp-hr) 
CO  
(lb/hr) 
PM  
(lb/hp-hr) 
SO2  
(lb/hp-hr) 
CI 1.07x10-4  6.96x10-1  7.00x10-4 0.00809xS1* 
*Obtained from AP-42, section 3.4 where S1 is sulfur content. 
     
 
Control Efficiencies: 
Technology HAP CO PM 
Oxidation catalyst 70% 70% 30% 
 
 
 Based on the above assumptions and the existing population of engines shown earlier in 
this section, the HAP, CO, and PM baseline emissions and reductions were calculated.  In 
addition to the final rule reducing HAP, CO, and PM, the rule will also lead to reductions in 
sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by requiring existing non-emergency CI engines greater than 300 
HP that use diesel fuel to use diesel fuel containing no more than 15 parts per million (ppm) of 
sulfur.  We have not quantified the SOx reductions that would occur as a result of engines 
switching to ULSD because we are unable to estimate the number of engines that already use 
ULSD and therefore we are unable to estimate the percentage of engines that may switch to 
ULSD due to this rule.  If none of the affected engines would use ULSD without this rule, then 
we estimate the SOx reductions are 31,000 tpy in the year 2013.  If all of the affected engines 
would use ULSD regardless of the rule, then the additional SOx reductions would be zero. 
The estimated reductions in tons per year (tpy) as a result of the final rule are shown in 
Table 4-8.  In addition, it is expected that additional PM reductions will be achieved by the 
requirement to use ULSD for CI engines that install a DOC.  The use of ULSD reduces the 
formation of sulfates in the exhaust gas, therefore reducing the emission of these sulfate PM 
emissions from the exhaust.  EPA has estimated that the use of ULSD can reduce PM emissions 
  
4-39 
by 5-30 percent depending on the sulfur concentration of the diesel fuel that is being replaced.  
Because EPA has no information on the type of fuel that CI engines are currently using, the PM 
reductions from switching to ULSD were not quantified and included in this summary. 
 The work practice requirement of using an open crankcase ventilation system to control 
metallic HAP emissions is expected to achieve additional HAP reductions from CI engines.  
However, the metallic HAP emission reduction cannot be quantified because of the difficulty of 
measuring metallic HAP from the crankcase exhaust.  Therefore, the metallic HAP reductions 
are not included in the total emission reductions.

SECTION 5  
ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS, ENERGY IMPACTS, AND SOCIAL COSTS 
The EIA provides decision makers with social cost estimates and enhances understanding 
of how the costs may be distributed across stakeholders (EPA, 2000). Although several 
economic frameworks can be used to estimate social costs for regulations of this size and sector 
scope, OAQPS has typically used partial equilibrium market models. However, the current data 
do not provide sufficient details to develop a market model; the data that are available have little 
or no sector/firm detail and are reported at the national level. In addition, some sectors have 
unique market characteristics (e.g., hospitals) that make developing partial equilibrium models 
difficult. Given these constraints, we believed the direct compliance costs as a reasonable 
approximation of total social costs. In addition, we also provide a qualitative analysis of the final 
rule’s economic impact on stakeholder decisions, a qualitative discussion on if unfunded 
mandates occur as a result of this final rule, and a qualitative discussion of the potential 
distribution of social costs between consumers and producers. 
5.1 Compliance Costs of the Final Rule 
For the year 2013, EPA’s engineering cost analysis estimates the total annualized costs of 
the final rule are $373 million (in 2008 dollars) (Nelson, 2010).  
As shown in Figure 5-1, the majority of the costs fall on the electric power sector (79%), 
followed by national security (9%). The remaining industries each account for 5% or less of the 
total annualized cost.  The industrial classification for each engine is taken from the Power 
Systems Research (PSR) database, which is the major source of data for the engines affected by 
the final rule.  The PSR database used as a basis for the analyses in this RIA contains 
information on both mobile and stationary onroad and nonroad engines, among other data, and 
does so not only for the U.S. but worldwide.  PSR has collected such data for more than 30 
years.  The Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) uses this database frequently in the 
development of their mobile source rules.  
The annualized compliance costs per engine vary by the engine size (see Figure 5-2). For 
300 hp engines or less, the annualized per-engine costs are below $215 per engine. Per-engine 
costs for higher horsepower (hp) engines range between $950 and $1,900. 
The final rule will affect approximately one million existing stationary diesel engines. As 
shown in Figure 5-3, most of the affected engines fall within the 100 to 175 hp category (31%). 
 5-2 
The next highest categories are 50 to 100 hp (24%) and 175 to 300 hp (23%). The remaining 
engines are concentrated in the 300 to 600 hp category (16%).

To assess the size of the compliance cost relative to the value of the goods and services 
for industries using affected engines, we collected Census data for selected industries. At the 
industry level, the annualized costs represent a very small fraction of revenue (less than 0.07%) 
(Table 5-1). These industry level cost-to-sales ratios can be interpreted as an average impact on 
potentially affected firms in these industries. Based on the cost-to-sales ratios, we can conclude 
that the annualized cost of this rule should be no higher than 1% of the sales on average for a 
firm in each of these industries.

5.2 How Might People and Firms Respond? A Partial Equilibrium Analysis 
Markets are composed of people as consumers and producers trying to maximize utility 
(consumers) and maximize profits (producers) they can given their economic circumstances. One 
way economists illustrate behavioral responses to pollution control costs is by using market 
supply and demand diagrams. The market supply curve describes how much of a good or service 
firms are willing and able to sell to people at a particular price; this curve is typically upward 
sloping because some production resources are fixed. As a result, the cost of producing an 
additional unit typically rises as more units are made. The market demand curve describes how 
much of a good or service consumers are willing and able to buy at some price. Holding other 
factors constant, the quantity demand is assumed to fall when prices rise. In a perfectly 
competitive market, equilibrium price (P0) and quantity (Q0) is determined by the intersection of 
the supply and demand curves (see Figure 5-4). 
5.2.1 Changes in Market Prices and Quantities  
To qualitatively assess how the regulation may influence the equilibrium price and 
quantity in the affected markets, we assumed the market supply function shifts up by the 
additional cost of producing the good or service; the unit cost increase is typically calculated by 
dividing the annual compliance cost estimate by the baseline quantity (Q0) (see Figure 5-4). As 
shown, this model makes two predictions: the price of the affected goods and services are likely 
to rise and the consumption/production levels are likely to fall.  
 
 5-6 
 
consumer surplus = –[fghd + dhc] 
producer surplus = [fghd – aehb] – bdc 
total surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus =  
–[aehb + dhc + bdc] 
Figure 5-4. Market Demand and Supply Model: With and Without Regulation 
 
The size of these changes depends on two factors: the size of the unit production cost 
increase (supply shift) and differences in how each side of the market (supply and demand) 
responds to changes in price. Economists measure responses using the concept of price elasticity, 
which represents the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price. 
This dependence has been expressed in the following formula:1 
( )Demand) of Elasticity Price -Supply  of Elasticity Price
Supply of Elasticity Price=cost  productionuniter-Share of p
 
As a general rule, a higher share of the per-unit cost increases will be passed on to 
consumers in markets where  
 goods and services are necessities and people do not have good substitutes that they 
can switch to easily (demand is inelastic) and 
                                                 
1For examples of similar mathematical models in the public finance literature, see Nicholson (1998), pages 444–447, 
or Fullerton and Metcalf (2002). 
 5-7 
 suppliers have excess capacity and can easily adjust production levels at minimal 
costs, or the time period of analysis is long enough that suppliers can change their 
fixed resources; supply is more elastic over longer periods.  
Short-run demand elasticities for energy goods (electricity and natural gas), agricultural 
products, and construction are often inelastic. Specific estimates of short-run demand elasticities 
for these products can be obtained from existing literature. For the short-run demand of energy 
products, the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) buildings module uses values between 
0.1 and 0.3; a 1% increase in price leads to a 0.1 to 0.3% decrease in energy demand (Wade, 
2003). For the short-run demand of agriculture and construction, the EPA has estimated 
elasticities to be 0.2 for agriculture and approximately 1 for construction (EPA, 2004). As a 
result, a 1% increase in the prices of agriculture products would lead to a 0.2% decrease in 
demand for those products, while a 1% increase in construction prices would lead to 
approximately a 1% decrease in demand for construction. Given these demand elasticity 
scenarios (shaded in gray), approximately a 1% increase unit costs would result in a price 
increase of 0.1 to 1% (Table 5-2). As a result, 10 to 100% of the unit cost increase could be 
passed on to consumers in the form of higher goods/services prices. This price increase would 
correspond to a 0.1 to 0.8% decline in consumption in these markets (Table 5-3).

5.2.2 Regulated Markets: The Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution 
Sector 
Given that the electric power sector bears majority of the estimated compliance costs 
(Figure 5-1) and the industry is also among the last major regulated energy industries in the 
United States (EIA, 2000), the competitive model is not necessarily applicable for this industry.

Although the electricity industry continues to go through a process of restructuring, whereby the 
industry is moving toward a more competitive framework (see Figure 5-5 for the status of 
restructuring by state),2 in many states, electricity prices continue to be fully regulated by Public 
Service Commissions. As a result, the rules and processes outlined by these agencies would 
ultimately determine how these additional regulatory costs would be recovered by affected 
entities. 
5.2.3 Partial Equilibrium Measures of Social Cost: Changes Consumer and Producer 
Surplus  
In partial equilibrium analysis, the social costs are estimated by measuring the changes in 
consumer and producer surplus, and these values can be determined using the market supply and 
demand model (Figure 5-4). The change in consumer surplus is measured as follows: 
 ΔCS = – [ΔQ1 × Δp] + [0.5 × ΔQ × Δp]. (5.1) 
Higher market prices and lower quantities lead to consumer welfare losses. Similarly, the change 
in producer surplus is measured as follows: 
 ΔPS = [ΔQ1 × Δp] – [ΔQ1 × t] – [0.5 × ΔQ × (Δp – t)]. (5.2) 
Higher unit costs and lower production level reduce producer surplus because the net 
price change (Δp – t) is negative. However, these losses are mitigated because market prices tend 
to rise.

5.3 Social Cost Estimate 
As shown in Table 5-1 the compliance costs are only a small fraction of the affected 
product value; this suggests that shift of the supply curve may also be small and result in small 
changes in market prices and consumption. EPA believes the national annualized compliance 
cost estimates provide a reasonable approximation of the social cost of this final rule.  EPA 
believes this approximation is better for industries whose markets are well characterized as 
perfectly competitive.  This approximation is less well understood for industries where the 
characterization of markets is not always perfectly competitive such as electric power generation 
.whose legal incidence of this rule is approximately 80 percent of the annualized compliance 
cost.   However, given the data limitation noted earlier, EPA believes the accounting for 
compliance cost is a reasonable approximation to inform policy discussion in this rulemaking.  
To shed more light on this issue, EPA ran hypothetical analyses and the results are in Tables 5-2 
and 5-3.    
 5-10 
5.4 Energy Impacts 
Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) provides that agencies will prepare 
and submit to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, a Statement of Energy Effects for certain actions identified as 
“significant energy actions.” Section 4(b) of Executive Order 13211 defines “significant energy 
actions” as any action by an agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that 
promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including 
notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking: 
(1) (i) that is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or any successor order, 
and (ii) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use of energy; 
or (2) that is designated by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
as a significant energy action. 
This rule is not a significant energy action as designated by the Administrator of the 
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs because it is not likely to have a significant adverse 
impact on the supply, distribution, or use of energy. EPA has prepared an analysis of energy 
impacts that explains this conclusion as follows below. 
With respect to energy supply and prices, the analysis in Table 5-1 suggests at the 
industry level, the annualized costs represent a very small fraction of revenue (less than 0.7%). 
As a result, we can conclude supply and price impacts should be small.  
To enhance understanding regarding the regulation’s influence on energy consumption, 
we examined publicly available data describing energy consumption for the electric power sector 
that will be affected by this rule. The Annual Energy Outlook 2010 (EIA, 2009) provides energy 
consumption data. As shown in Table 5-4, this industry account for less than 0.5% of the U.S. 
total liquid fuels and less than 5.2% of natural gas. As a result, any energy consumption changes 
attributable to the regulatory program should not significantly influence the supply, distribution, 
or use of energy. 
5.5 Unfunded Mandates 
Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538, 
requires Federal agencies, unless otherwise prohibited by law, to assess the effects of their 
regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. This rule 
contains a Federal mandate that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more for State, 
local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector in any one year. 
 5-11 
Accordingly, EPA has prepared under section 202 of the UMRA a written statement which is 
summarized below in this section.

5.5.1 Future and Disproportionate Costs 
The UMRA requires that we estimate, where accurate estimation is reasonably feasible, 
future compliance costs imposed by the rule and any disproportionate budgetary effects. Our 
estimates of the future compliance costs of the final rule are discussed previously in Section 4 of 
this RIA. We do not believe that there will be any disproportionate budgetary effects of the final 
rule on any particular areas of the country, State or local governments, types of communities 
(e.g., urban, rural), or particular industry segments.  
5.5.2 Effects on the National Economy 
The UMRA requires that we estimate the effect of the final rule on the national economy. 
To the extent feasible, we must estimate the effect on productivity, economic growth, full 
employment, creation of productive jobs, and international competitiveness of the U.S. goods 
and services if we determine that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible and that such effect 
is relevant and material. The nationwide economic impact of the final rule is presented earlier in 
this RIA chapter. This analysis provides estimates of the effect of the final rule on most of the 
 5-13 
categories mentioned above, and these estimates are presented earlier in this RIA chapter. In 
addition, we have determined that the final rule contains no regulatory requirements that might 
significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, today’s rule is not subject to the 
requirements of section 203 of the UMRA.  
5.6 Environmental Justice 
 
Executive Order (EO) 12898 (59 FR 7629 (Feb. 16, 1994)) establishes federal executive 
policy on environmental justice.  Its main provision directs federal agencies, to the greatest 
extent practicable and permitted by law, to make environmental justice part of their mission by 
identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or 
environmental effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-
income populations in the United States.   
EPA has determined that this final rule will not have disproportionately high and adverse 
human health or environmental effects on minority or low-income populations because it 
increases the level of environmental protection for all affected populations without having any 
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on any population, 
including any minority or low-income population.  This rule is a nationwide standard that 
reduces air toxics emissions from existing stationary CI engines, thus decreasing the amount of 
such emissions to which all affected populations are exposed.  
 
 
 6-1 
SECTION 6  
SMALL ENTITY SCREENING ANALYSIS 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act as amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) generally requires an agency to prepare a regulatory 
flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the 
Administrative Procedure Act or any other statute, unless the agency certifies that the rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities 
as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) include small businesses, small 
governmental jurisdictions, and small not-for-profit enterprises. 
After considering the economic impact of the final rule on small entities, the screening 
analysis indicates that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities (or “SISNOSE”). Under the primary cost analyses EPA considered, 
sales and revenue tests for establishments owned by model small entities are less than 3% and 
only one group of establishments (irrigated farms with receipts less than $25,000) has a ratio 
exceeding 1%.  
6.1 Small Entity Data Set 
The industry sectors covered by the final rule were identified during the development of 
the cost analysis (Nelson, 2009). The SUSB provides national information on the distribution of 
economic variables by industry and enterprise size (U.S. Census, 2006a, b).1 The Census Bureau 
and the Office of Advocacy of the SBA supported and developed these files for use in a broad 
range of economic analyses.2 Statistics include the total number of establishments and receipts 
for all entities in an industry; however, many of these entities may not necessarily be covered by 
the final rule. SUSB also provides statistics by enterprise employment and receipt size.  
The Census Bureau’s definitions used in the SUSB, which are stated in Section 3 and 
restated here for clarity of presentation, are as follows: 
 Establishment: An establishment is a single physical location where business is 
conducted or where services or industrial operations are performed.  
 Receipts: Receipts (net of taxes) are defined as the revenue for goods produced, 
distributed, or services provided, including revenue earned from premiums, 
                                                 
1The SUSB data do not provide establishment information for the national security NAICS code (92811) or irrigated 
farms. Since most national security installations are owned by the federal government (e.g., military bases), EPA 
assumes these entities would not be considered small. For irrigated farms, we relied on receipt data provided in 
the 2008 Farm and Irrigation Survey (USDA, 2009). 
2See http://www.census.gov/csd/susb/ and http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/data.html for additional details. 
 6-2 
commissions and fees, rents, interest, dividends, and royalties. Receipts exclude all 
revenue collected for local, state, and federal taxes.  
 Enterprise: An enterprise is a business organization consisting of one or more 
domestic establishments that were specified under common ownership or control. The 
enterprise and the establishment are the same for single-establishment firms. Each 
multiestablishment company forms one enterprise—the enterprise employment and 
annual payroll are summed from the associated establishments. Enterprise size 
designations are determined by the summed employment of all associated 
establishments. 
Because the SBA’s business size definitions (SBA, 2008) apply to an establishment’s 
“ultimate parent company,” we assumed in this analysis that the “enterprise” definition above is 
consistent with the concept of ultimate parent company that is typically used for SBREFA 
screening analyses and the terms are used interchangeably.  
6.2 Small Entity Economic Impact Measures 
The analysis generated a set of establishment sales tests (represented as cost-to-receipt 
ratios)3 for NAICS codes associated with sectors listed in Table 6-1. Although the appropriate 
SBA size definition should be applied at the parent company (enterprise) level, we can only 
compute and compare ratios for a model establishment owned by an enterprise within an SUSB 
size range (employment or receipts). Using the SUSB size range helps us account for receipt 
differences between establishments owned by large and small enterprises and also allows us to 
consider the variation in small business definitions across affected industries. Using 
establishment receipts is also a conservative approach, because an establishment’s parent 
company (the “enterprise”) may have other economic resources that could be used to cover the 
costs of the final rule. 
6.2.1 Model Establishment Receipts and Annual Compliance Costs 
The sales test compares a representative establishment’s total annual engine costs to the 
average establishment receipts for enterprises in several size categories.4 For industries with SBA 
                                                 
3The following metrics for other small entity economic impact measures (if applicable) would potentially include 
• small governments (if applicable): “revenue” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
government revenues and 
• small nonprofits (if applicable): “expenditure” test; annualized compliance cost as a percentage of annual 
operating expenses, 
4For the 1 to 20 employee category, we excluded SUSB data for enterprises with zero employees. These enterprises 
did not operate the entire year. 
 6-3 
employment size standards, we calculated average establishment receipts for each enterprise 
employment range (Table 6-2).5 For industries with SBA receipt size standards, we calculated

average establishment receipts for each enterprise receipt range (Table 6-3). We included the 
utility sector in the second group, although the SBA size standard for this industry is defined in 
terms of physical units (megawatt hours) versus receipts. Crop and animal production (NAICS 
111 and 112) also have an SBA receipt size standard that defines a small business as receiving 
$750,000 or less in receipts per year. However, SUSB data were not available for these 
industries. Therefore, we conducted the sales test using the following range of establishment 
receipts: farms with annual receipts of $25,000 or less, farms with annual receipts of $100,000 or

Annual entity compliance costs vary depending on the size of the diesel engines used at 
the affected establishment. Absent facility-specific information, we computed per-entity 
compliance costs based for three different cases based on representative establishments—Cases 
1, 2, and 3 (see Table 6-4). Each representative establishment differs based on the size and 
number of diesel engines being used. Compliance costs are calculated by summing the total 
annualized compliance costs for the relevant engine categories, dividing the sum by the total 
existing population of those engines, and multiplying the average engine cost by the number of 
engines assumed to be at the establishment. Since NAICS 2211 and 622110 are fundamentally 
different than other industries considered in this analysis, we used different assumptions about 
what constitutes the representative establishment and report these assumptions separately.  
 Case 1: The representative establishment for all industries uses three 750+ hp engines 
with an average compliance cost of $1,877 per engine, resulting in a total annualized 
compliance cost of approximately $5,631 for this representative establishment.  
 Case 2: The representative establishment in NACIS 2211 and 622110 uses two 50 to 
750+ hp engines with an average compliance cost of $437 per engine, resulting in a 
total annualized compliance cost of $874 for this representative establishment. For all 
other industries, the representative establishment uses two 50 to 300 hp engines with 
an average compliance cost of $155 per engine, resulting in a total compliance cost of 
$310 for this representative establishment.  
 Case 3: The representative establishment for all industries uses two 50 to 100 hp 
engines with an average compliance cost of $68 per engine, resulting in a total 
compliance cost of $137 for this representative establishment.  
EPA believes that small entities are most likely to face costs similar to Case 2 (columns 
shaded in gray in Table 6-4) because most of the engines to be affected by this proposal in 
NAICS 335312, 333992, 211111, and 211112 are under 300 hp capacity, and most small entities 
in these industries will own engines of this size or smaller. This is corroborated by Figure 6-1 
and 6-2 which shows the distribution of engine population and compliance costs by engine size 
for all industries. However, it is difficult to make a similar claim for NAICS 2211 and 622110 
based on the existing distribution of engines in these industries.6  As noted earlier in the RIA, 
only 20 percent of the existing distribution of engines is expected to be classified as non-
emergency.   
                                                 
6This claim also cannot be made for NAICS 92811: National Security. However, since most national security 
installations are owned by the federal government (e.g., military bases), EPA assumes these entities would not be 
considered small.

For the sales test, we divided the representative establishment compliance costs reported 
in Table 6-4 by the representative establishment receipts reported in Tables 6-2 and 6-3. This is 
known as the cost-to-receipt (i.e., sales) ratio, or the “sales test.” The “sales test” is the impact

methodology EPA employs in analyzing small entity impacts as opposed to a “profits test,” in 
which annualized compliance costs are calculated as a share of profits. 
This is because revenues or sales data are commonly available data for entities normally 
impacted by EPA regulations and profits data normally made available are often not the true 
profit earned by firms because of accounting and tax considerations. Revenues as typically 
published are usually correct figures and are more reliably reported when compared to profit 
data. The use of a “sales test” for estimating small business impacts for a rulemaking such as this 
one is consistent with guidance offered by EPA on compliance with SBREFA7 and is consistent 
with guidance published by the U.S. SBA’s Office of Advocacy that suggests that cost as a

percentage of total revenues is a metric for evaluating cost increases on small entities in relation 
to increases on large entities.8 
If the cost-to-receipt ratio is less than 1%, then we consider the final rule to not have a 
significant impact on the establishment company in question. We summarize the industries with 
cost-to-receipt ratios exceeding 1% below: 
Primary Analysis: 
 Case 2: NAICS 2211 with receipts less than $100,000 per year  
 Case 3: No industries 
Sensitivity Analysis (unlikely): 
 Case 1: NAICS 211111, 211112, with less than 20 employees, NAICS 2211 with 
receipts less than $500,000 per year, NAICS 234 with receipts less than $500,000 per 
year, and irrigated farms with receipts of $500,000 or less per year 
In the Case 2 primary analysis, only establishments in NAICS 2211 with receipts less 
than $100,000 per year have cost-to-receipt ratios above 1%. These establishments represent less 
than 5 percent of affected small establishments.  However, establishments earning this level of 
receipts are likely to be using smaller engines than those assumed in Case 2, such as 50 to 100 hp 
engines. The results of our Case 3 analysis demonstrate that these establishments are not 
significantly impacted when taking this engine size into account.  
6.3 Small Government Entities 
The rule also covers sectors that include entities owned by small and large governments. 
However, given the uncertainty and data limitations associated with identifying and 
appropriately classifying these entities, we computed a “revenue” test for a model small 
government, where the annualized compliance cost is a percentage of annual government 
revenues (U.S. Census, 2005a, b). The use of a “revenue test” for estimating impacts to small 
governments for a rulemaking such as this one is consistent with guidance offered by EPA on 
compliance with SBREFA,9 and is consistent with guidance published by the US SBA’s Office 
of Advocacy.10 For example, from the 2002 Census (in 2008 dollars), the average revenue for

small governments (counties and municipalities) with populations fewer than 10,000 are $3 
million per entity, and the average revenue for local governments with populations fewer than 
50,000 is $8 million per entity. For the smallest group of local governments (<10,000 people), 
the cost-to-revenue ratio would be 0.2% or less under each case. For the larger group of 
governments (<50,000 people), the cost-to-revenue ratio is 0.1% or less under all cases.

SECTION 7  
HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS 
7.1 Synopsis 
In this section, we provide an estimate of the particulate matter (PM) co-benefits for the 
final NESHAP for existing stationary compression ignition (RICE). Specifically, we calculated 
the benefits of this rule in terms of the co-benefits associated with reducing PM rather than 
calculating the benefits associated with reducing hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). These PM 
reductions are a consequence of the technologies installed to reduce HAP emissions from RICE.  
These estimates reflect the monetized human health co-benefits of reducing cases of morbidity 
and premature mortality associated with reducing exposure to the PM2.5 precursors from the 
current RICE technology. We estimate the total monetized PM2.5 co-benefits to be $940 million 
to $2.3 billion (2008$) at a 3% discount rate and $850 million to $2.1 billion at a 7% discount 
rate in the year of full implementation (2013).     Data, resource, and methodological limitations 
prevented EPA from quantifying or monetizing the benefits from several important benefit 
categories, including benefits from reducing carbon monoxide (CO) and HAPs, ecosystem 
effects, and visibility impairment. The benefits from reducing 1,014 tons of hazardous air 
pollutants each year have not been monetized in this analysis.  
These estimates of the reduction in particulate matter-related health effects reflect EPA’s 
most current interpretation of the scientific literature and include four key updates: (1) a no-
threshold model for PM2.5 that calculates incremental co-benefits down to the lowest modeled air 
quality levels; (2) a revised Value of a Statistical Life (VSL); (3) two technical updates to the 
population dataset and aggregation method; (4) presentation of results derived from Pope et al. 
(2002) and Laden et al. (2006) instead of using the extremes of EPA’s Expert Elicitation on PM 
Mortality (Roman et al., 2008). Higher or lower estimates of co-benefits are possible using other 
assumptions; examples of this are provided in Figure 7-2.  
7.2 Calculation of PM2.5 Human Health Co-benefits 
  This rulemaking would reduce emissions of PM2.5, SO2, and VOCs. Because SOx and 
VOCs are also precursors to PM2.5, reducing these emissions would also reduce PM2.5 formation, 
human exposure and the incidence of PM2.5-related health effects. In this analysis, we estimated 
the co-benefits of reducing PM2.5 exposure for the alternative standards. Due to analytical 
limitations, it was not possible to provide a comprehensive estimate of PM2.5-related co-benefits. 
Instead, we used the “benefit-per-ton” method to estimate these co-benefits (Fann et al., 2009). 
The PM2.5 benefit-per-ton methodology incorporates key assumptions described in detail below. 
 7-2 
These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton estimates provide the total monetized human health co-benefits (the 
sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) of reducing one ton of PM2.5 from a 
specified source. EPA has used the benefit per-ton technique in previous RIAs, including the 
recent SO2 NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009b). Table 7-1 shows the quantified and unquantified 
co-benefits captured in those benefit-per-ton estimates.

Consistent with the Portland Cement NESHAP (U.S. EPA, 2009a), the co-benefits 
estimates utilize the concentration-response functions as reported in the epidemiology literature, 
as well as the 12 functions obtained in EPA’s expert elicitation study as a sensitivity analysis.  
 One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from 
the extended analysis of American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as reported in Pope 
et al. (2002), a study that EPA has previously used to generate its primary PM co-
benefits estimate. When calculating the estimate, EPA applied the effect coefficient 
as reported in the study without an adjustment for assumed concentration threshold of 
10 µg/m3 as was done in recent (post-2006) Office of Air and Radiation RIAs. 
 One estimate is based on the C-R function developed from the extended analysis of 
the Harvard Six Cities cohort, as reported by Laden et al (2006). This study, 
published after the completion of the Staff Paper for the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS, has 
been used as an alternative estimate in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and PM2.5 co-
benefits estimates in RIAs completed since the PM2.5 NAAQS. When calculating the 
estimate, EPA applied the effect coefficient as reported in the study without an 
adjustment for assumed concentration threshold of 10 µg/m3 as was done in recent 
(post 2006) RIAs.  
 7-3 
 Twelve estimates are based on the C-R functions from EPA’s expert elicitation study 
(Roman et al., 2008) on the PM2.5 -mortality relationship and interpreted for PM co-
benefits analysis in EPA’s final RIA for the PM2.5 NAAQS. For that study, twelve 
experts (labeled A through L) provided independent estimates of the PM2.5-mortality 
concentration-response function. EPA practice has been to develop independent 
estimates of PM2.5-mortality estimates corresponding to the concentration-response 
function provided by each of the twelve experts, to better characterize the degree of 
variability in the expert responses. 
The effect coefficients are drawn from epidemiology studies examining two large 
population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002) and the Harvard Six 
Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006).1 These are logical choices for anchor points in our presentation 
because, while both studies are well designed and peer reviewed, there are strengths and 
weaknesses inherent in each, which we believe argues for using both studies to generate co-
benefits estimates. Previously, EPA had calculated co-benefits based on these two empirical 
studies, but derived the range of co-benefits, including the minimum and maximum results, from 
an expert elicitation of the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and premature mortality 
(Roman et al., 2008).2 Within this assessment, we include the co-benefits estimates derived from 
the concentration-response function provided by each of the twelve experts to better characterize 
the uncertainty in the concentration-response function for mortality and the degree of variability 
in the expert responses. Because the experts used these cohort studies to inform their 
concentration-response functions, co-benefits estimates using these functions generally fall 
between results using these epidemiology studies (see Figure 7-2). In general, the expert 
elicitation results support the conclusion that the co-benefits of PM2.5 control are very likely to be 
substantial. 
Readers interested in reviewing the methodology for creating the benefit-per-ton 
estimates used in this analysis should consult Fann et al. (2009). As described in the 
documentation for the benefit per-ton estimates cited above, national per-ton estimates are 
developed for selected pollutant/source category combinations. The per-ton values calculated 
therefore apply only to tons reduced from those specific pollutant/source combinations (e.g., 
NO2 emitted from electric generating units; NO2 emitted from mobile sources). Our estimate of 
PM2.5 co-control benefits is therefore based on the total PM2.5 emissions controlled by sector and 
multiplied by this per-ton value.  
                                                 
1 These two studies specify multi-pollutant models that control for SO2, among other co-pollutants. 
2 Please see the Section 5.2 of the Portland Cement RIA in Appendix 5A for more information regarding the change 
in the presentation of benefits estimates.  
 7-4 
The underlying emissions modeling and air quality modeling account for the current 
distribution of emissions sources, including both urban and rural sources.  In addition, the air 
quality modeling included 14 vertical layers to simulate the differences between ground-level 
emissions and higher stack emissions (U.S. EPA, 2006a). The distance that particles travel 
primarily depends on the size of the particle, the amount and release height of emissions, terrain, 
and meteorological conditions, such as wind speed and precipitation.  Fine particles can have an 
atmospheric half-life of days to weeks and travel hundreds to thousands of kilometers, whereas 
ultrafine and coarse particles travel less than ten kilometers (U.S. EPA, 2009c). Because we have 
not undertaken a study specific to emissions at ground level from RICE, with regard to transport 
issues and to size fraction of PM2.5 emissions (e.g., ultrafines and near ultrafines), there is 
uncertainty as to how far such emissions will travel and thus with regard to populations affected.  
Evidence from recent air quality modeling for mobile source rules with similar engines (U.S. 
EPA, 1999; U.S. EPA, 2000; U.S. EPA, 2004; U.S. EPA, 2008e; U.S. EPA, 2010c) shows that 
some fine particles can travel long distances in the atmosphere, but the proportion of such 
emissions from RICE that travel more than short distances is not yet definitively known. 
The benefit-per-ton coefficients in this analysis were derived using modified versions of 
the health impact functions used in the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis (U.S. EPA, 
2006b). Specifically, this analysis uses the benefit-per-ton method first applied in the Portland 
Cement NESHAP RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009a), which incorporated three updates: a new population 
dataset, an expanded geographic scope of the benefit-per-ton calculation, and the functions 
directly from the epidemiology studies without an adjustment for an assumed threshold.3 
Removing the threshold assumption is a key difference between the method used in this analysis 
of PM co-benefits and the methods used in RIAs prior to that for the Portland Cement NESHAP, 
and we now calculate incremental co-benefits down to the lowest modeled PM2.5 air quality 
levels.  
EPA strives to use the best available science to support our benefits analyses, and we 
recognize that interpretation of the science regarding air pollution and health is dynamic and 
evolving. Based on our review of the body of scientific literature, EPA applied the no-threshold 
model in this analysis. EPA’s Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. EPA, 
2009c), which was recently reviewed by EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. 
EPA-SAB, 2009a; U.S. EPA-SAB, 2009b), concluded that the scientific literature consistently 
finds that a no-threshold log-linear model most adequately portrays the PM-mortality

discussed on the next page.

concentration-response relationship while recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact 
shape of the concentration-response function.4 Although this document does not necessarily 
represent agency policy, it provides a basis for reconsidering the application of thresholds in 
PM2.5 concentration-response functions used in EPA’s RIAs. 5  
Because the co-benefits are sensitive to the assumption of a threshold, we also provide a 
sensitivity analysis using the previous methodology (i.e., a threshold model at 10 µg/m3 without 
the two technical updates) as a historical reference. Table 7-5 shows the sensitivity of an 
assumed threshold on the monetized results, with and without an assumed threshold at 10 µg/m3.  
As is the nature of Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs), the assumptions and methods 
used to estimate air quality benefits evolve over time to reflect the Agency’s most current 
interpretation of the scientific and economic literature. For a period of time (2004–2008), the 
Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued mortality risk reductions using a value of statistical 
life (VSL) estimate derived from a limited analysis of some of the available studies. OAR arrived 
at a VSL using a range of $1 million to $10 million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of 
the wage-risk literature. The $1 million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range 
from the Mrozek and Taylor (2002) meta-analysis of 33 studies. The $10 million value 
represented the upper end of the interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003) meta-
analysis of 43 studies. The mean estimate of $5.5 million (2000$)6 was also consistent with the 
mean VSL of $5.4 million estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006) meta-analysis. However, the 
Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rule-makings nor subjected 
the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board 
(SAB) or other peer-review group.  
During this time, the Agency continued work to update its guidance on valuing mortality 
risk reductions, including commissioning a report from meta-analytic experts to evaluate 
methodological questions raised by EPA and the SAB on combining estimates from the various 
data sources. In addition, the Agency consulted several times with the Science Advisory Board 
Environmental Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) on the issue. With input from the 
                                                 
4 It is important to note that uncertainty regarding the shape of the concentration-response function is conceptually 
distinct from an assumed threshold. An assumed threshold (below which there are no health effects) is a 
discontinuity, which is a specific example of non-linearity.  
5 In the Portland Cement RIA (U.S. EPA, 2009a), EPA solicited comment on the use of the no-threshold model for 
benefits analysis within the preamble of that proposed rule. The comment period for the Portland Cement 
proposed NESHAP closed on September 4, 2009 (Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OAR–2002–0051 available at 
http://www.regulations.gov). EPA is currently reviewing those comments. 
6 In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2008$) and to account for income 
growth to 2015. After applying these adjustments to the $5.5 million value, the VSL is $7.9 million.  
 7-6 
meta-analytic experts, the SAB-EEAC advised the Agency to update its guidance using specific, 
appropriate meta-analytic techniques to combine estimates from unique data sources and 
different studies, including those using different methodologies (i.e., wage-risk and stated 
preference) (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2007). 
Until updated guidance is available, the Agency determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the SAB-EEAC advice it has received. Therefore, the 
Agency has decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines 
for Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)7 while the Agency continues its efforts to 
update its guidance on this issue. This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates 
derived from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 
1991. The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).8 The Agency is committed to 
using scientifically sound, appropriately reviewed evidence in valuing mortality risk reductions 
and has made significant progress in responding to the SAB-EEAC’s specific recommendations. 
The Agency anticipates presenting results from this effort to the SAB-EEAC in Spring 2010 and 
that draft guidance will be available shortly thereafter. 
Figure 7-1 illustrates the relative breakdown of the monetized PM2.5 health co-benefits.  
                                                 
7 In the (draft) update of the Economic Guidelines (U.S. EPA, 2008), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by the SAB 
with the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be forthcoming in the 
near future. Therefore, this report does not represent final agency policy.  
8 In this analysis, we adjust the VSL to account for a different currency year (2008$) and to account for income 
growth to 2015. After applying these adjustments to the $6.3 million value, the VSL is $9.1m.

Figure 7-1. Breakdown of Monetized PM2.5 Health Co-benefits using Mortality 
Function from Pope et al. (2002)a 
a This pie chart breakdown is illustrative, using the results based on Pope et al. (2002) as an example. Using the 
Laden et al. (2006) function for premature mortality, the percentage of total monetized PM2.5 co-benefits due to 
adult premature mortality would be 97%. This chart shows the breakdown using a 3% discount rate, and the 
results would be similar if a 7% discount rate was used.  
Table 7-2 provides a general summary of the results by pollutant, including the emission 
reductions and monetized benefits-per-ton at discount rates of 3% and 7%.9. Table 7-3 provides a 
summary of the reductions in health incidences as a result of the pollution reductions. In Table 7-
4, we provide the co-benefits using our anchor points of Pope et al. and Laden et al. as well as 
the results from the expert elicitation on PM2.5-related premature mortality. Figures 7-2 and 7-3 
provide a visual representation of the range of co-benefits estimates and the pollutant breakdown 
of the monetized co-benefits.  
                                                 
9 To comply with Circular A-4, EPA provides monetized benefits using discount rates of 3% and 7% (OMB, 2003). 
These benefits are estimated for a specific analysis year (i.e., 2013), and most of the PM co-benefits occur within 
that year with two exceptions: acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) and premature mortality.  For AMIs, we 
assume 5 years of follow-up medical costs and lost wages.  For premature mortality, we assume that there is a 
“cessation” lag between PM exposures and the total realization of changes in health effects. Although the 
structure of the lag is uncertain, EPA follows the advice of the SAB-HES to assume a segmented lag structure 
characterized by 30% of mortality reductions in the first year, 50% over years 2 to 5, and 20% over the years 6 to 
20 after the reduction in PM2.5 (U.S. EPA-SAB, 2004). Changes in the lag assumptions do not change the total 
number of estimated deaths but rather the timing of those deaths.  Therefore, discounting only affects the AMI 
costs after the analysis year and the valuation of premature mortalities that occur after the analysis year.  As 
such, the monetized benefits using a 7% discount rate are only approximately 10% less than the monetized 
benefits using a 3% discount rate.

7.3 Unquantified Benefits 
The monetized co-benefits estimated in this RIA only reflect the portion of benefits 
attributable to the health effect reductions associated with ambient fine particles. Data, resource, 
and methodological limitations prevented EPA from quantifying or monetizing the benefits from 
several important benefit categories, including benefits from reducing carbon monoxide and 
hazardous air pollutants, ecosystem effects, and visibility impairment. The health benefits from 
reducing 1,014 tons of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and the 14,000 tons of carbon monoxide 
each year have not been monetized in this analysis. 
In this analysis, we have not quantified the benefits attributable to the SO2 reductions that 
would occur as a result of these engines switching to ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD).  Although 
we are confident that some SO2 reductions would occur as a result of this rule, we are unable to 
estimate the percentage of engines that may switch to ULSD in the absence of this rule or the 
number of engines that already use ULSD.  As a PM2.5 precursor, these SO2 emission reductions 
would lead to fewer PM2.5-related health effects.  Because of uncertainty in the magnitude of the 
attributable SO2 reductions and to avoid the appearance of double-counting, we have chosen to 
not include these estimates in any of the results tables or graphics in this RIA.  If none of the 
affected engines would use ULSD without this rule, then we estimate the additional monetized 
PM2.5-related health co-benefits would be $720 million to $1.8 billion in 2013 (2008$, 3% 
discount rate).  This is based on reductions of 31,000 tons of SO2 emission reductions in the year 
2013 that will take place if all affected engines would switch to ULSD for higher-sulfur diesel 
fuel (3000 ppm sulfur content) as mentioned in Section 4.  If all of the affected engines would 
use ULSD regardless of the rule, then the monetized co-benefits from SO2 reductions would be 
zero. In addition to being a PM2.5 precursor, SO2 emissions also contribute to adverse effects 
from acidic deposition in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as well as visibility impairment.  
HAP benefits 
Due to data, resource, and methodology limitations, we were unable to estimate the 
benefits associated with the 1,014 tons of hazardous air pollutants that would be reduced as a 
result of this rule.  Available emissions data show that several different HAPs are emitted from 
stationary engines, either contained within the fuel burned or formed during the combustion 
 7-12 
process.10  Although numerous HAPs may be emitted from diesel stationary RICE, a few HAPs 
account for 80% of the total mass of HAPs emissions emitted.  These HAPs are formaldehyde 
(25%), acetaldehyde (19%), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (18%), naphthalene (9%), 
and acrolein (9%). Other HAPs from diesel stationary RICE represent less than 5% each of the 
total mass of HAP emissions, including 1,3-butadiene (4.4%), toluene (3.8%), styrene (3.5%) , 
benzene (2.8%), xylene (2.7%), hexane (1.8%), and ethylbenzene (0.3%).  Metallic HAPs from 
diesel fired stationary RICE represent less than 0.3% each of total mass of HAP emissions, 
including  cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, selenium, and mercury.  Below we describe the 
health effects associated with the top 5 HAPs by mass emitted from RICE.   
Formaldehyde 
  Since 1987, EPA has classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen based on 
evidence in humans and in rats, mice, hamsters, and monkeys.11  EPA is currently reviewing 
recently published epidemiological data.  For instance, research conducted by the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) found an increased risk of nasopharyngeal cancer and 
lymphohematopoietic malignancies such as leukemia among workers exposed to 
formaldehyde.12,13  In an analysis of the lymphohematopoietic cancer mortality from an extended 
follow-up of these workers, NCI confirmed an association between lymphohematopoietic cancer 
risk and peak exposures.14 A recent National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH) study of garment workers also found increased risk of death due to leukemia among 
workers exposed to formaldehyde.15  Extended follow-up of a cohort of British chemical workers 
did not find evidence of an increase in nasopharyngeal or lymphohematopoietic cancers, but a 
continuing statistically significant excess in lung cancers was reported.16

 In the past 15 years there has been substantial research on the inhalation dosimetry for 
formaldehyde in rodents and primates by the CIIT Centers for Health Research (formerly the 
Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology), with a focus on use of rodent data for refinement of 
the quantitative cancer dose-response assessment.17,18,19  CIIT’s risk assessment of formaldehyde 
incorporated mechanistic and dosimetric information on formaldehyde. However, it should be 
noted that recent research published by EPA indicates that when two-stage modeling 
assumptions are varied, resulting dose-response estimates can vary by several orders of 
magnitude.20,21,22,23  These findings are not supportive of interpreting the CIIT model results as 
providing a conservative (health protective) estimate of human risk.24  EPA research also 
examined the contribution of the two-stage modeling for formaldehyde towards characterizing 
the relative weights of key events in the mode-of-action of a carcinogen.  For example, the 
model-based inference in the published CIIT study that formaldehyde’s direct mutagenic action 
is not relevant to the compound’s tumorigenicity was found not to hold under variations of 
modeling assumptions.25 
Based on the developments of the last decade, in 2004, the working group of the IARC 
concluded that formaldehyde is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), on the basis of sufficient 
evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in experimental animals - a higher classification than 
previous IARC evaluations.  After reviewing the currently available epidemiological evidence, 
the IARC (2006) characterized the human evidence for formaldehyde carcinogenicity as 
“sufficient,” based upon the data on nasopharyngeal cancers; the epidemiologic evidence on

NCI and NIOSH, as well as the analysis by the CIIT Centers for Health Research and other 
studies, as part of a reassessment of the human hazard and dose-response associated with 
formaldehyde. 
Formaldehyde exposure also causes a range of noncancer health effects, including 
irritation of the eyes (burning and watering of the eyes), nose and throat.  Effects from repeated 
exposure in humans include respiratory tract irritation, chronic bronchitis and nasal epithelial 
lesions such as metaplasia and loss of cilia.  Animal studies suggest that formaldehyde may also 
cause airway inflammation – including eosinophil infiltration into the airways. There are several 
studies that suggest that formaldehyde may increase the risk of asthma – particularly in the 
young.27,28 
  Acetaldehyde 
Acetaldehyde is classified in EPA’s IRIS database as a probable human carcinogen, 
based on nasal tumors in rats, and is considered toxic by the inhalation, oral, and intravenous 
routes.29  Acetaldehyde is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen by the U.S. DHHS in 
the 11th Report on Carcinogens and is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) 
by the IARC.30,31  EPA is currently conducting a reassessment of cancer risk from inhalation 
exposure to acetaldehyde. 
The primary noncancer effects of exposure to acetaldehyde vapors include irritation of 
the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.32  In short-term (4 week) rat studies, degeneration of

Data from these studies were used by EPA to develop an inhalation reference concentration.  
Some asthmatics have been shown to be a sensitive subpopulation to decrements in functional 
expiratory volume (FEV1 test) and bronchoconstriction upon acetaldehyde inhalation.35  The 
agency is currently conducting a reassessment of the health hazards from inhalation exposure to 
acetaldehyde.   
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) At least eight PAH compounds are classified 
by EPA as probable human carcinogens based on animal data, including acenaphthene36, 
benzo(a)anthracene37, benzo(b)fluoranthene38, benzo(k)fluoranthene39, benzo(a)pyrene40, 
chrysene41, dibenz(a,h)anthracene42, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene43.   Recent studies have found 
that maternal exposures to PAHs  in a population of pregnant women were associated with

several adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight and reduced length at birth, as well as 
impaired cognitive development at age three.44,45  EPA has not yet evaluated these recent studies. 
 Naphthalene 
Naphthalene is found in small quantities in gasoline and diesel fuels.  Naphthalene 
emissions have been measured in larger quantities in both gasoline and diesel exhaust compared 
with evaporative emissions from mobile sources, indicating it is primarily a product of 
combustion.  EPA released an external review draft of a reassessment of the inhalation 
carcinogenicity of naphthalene based on a number of recent animal carcinogenicity studies.46  
The draft reassessment completed external peer review.47  Based on external peer review 
comments received, additional analyses are being undertaken.  This external review draft does 
not represent official agency opinion and was released solely for the purposes of external peer 
review and public comment.  The National Toxicology Program listed naphthalene as 
"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen" in 2004 on the basis of bioassays reporting 
clear evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and some evidence of carcinogenicity in mice.48  
California EPA has released a new risk assessment for naphthalene, and the IARC has 
reevaluated naphthalene and re-classified it as Group 2B: possibly carcinogenic to humans.49  
Naphthalene also causes a number of chronic non-cancer effects in animals, including abnormal 
cell changes and growth in respiratory and nasal tissues.50

  Acrolein 
 EPA determined in 2003 that the human carcinogenic potential of acrolein could not be 
determined because the available data were inadequate.  No information was available on the 
carcinogenic effects of acrolein in humans and the animal data provided inadequate evidence of 
carcinogenicity.51  The IARC determined in 1995 that acrolein was not classifiable as to its 
carcinogenicity in humans.52 
Acrolein is extremely acrid and irritating to humans when inhaled, with acute exposure 
resulting in upper respiratory tract irritation, mucus hypersecretion and congestion.  The intense 
irritancy of this carbonyl has been demonstrated during controlled tests in human subjects, who 
suffer intolerable eye and nasal mucosal sensory reactions within minutes of exposure.53  These 
data and additional studies regarding acute effects of human exposure to acrolein are 
summarized in EPA’s 2003 IRIS Human Health Assessment for acrolein.54  Evidence available 
from studies in humans indicate that levels as low as 0.09 ppm (0.21 mg/m3) for five minutes 
may elicit subjective complaints of eye irritation with increasing concentrations leading to more 
extensive eye, nose and respiratory symptoms.55  Lesions to the lungs and upper respiratory tract 
of rats, rabbits, and hamsters have been observed after subchronic exposure to acrolein.56  Acute 
exposure effects in animal studies report bronchial hyper-responsiveness.57  In a recent study, the 
acute respiratory irritant effects of exposure to 1.1 ppm acrolein were more pronounced in mice 
with allergic airway disease by comparison to non-diseased mice which also showed decreases in 
respiratory rate.58  Based on these animal data and demonstration of similar effects in humans 
(i.e., reduction in respiratory rate), individuals with compromised respiratory function (e.g., 
emphysema, asthma) are expected to be at increased risk of developing adverse responses to

strong respiratory irritants such as acrolein.   
Other Air Toxics 
In addition to the compounds described above, other compounds in gaseous hydrocarbon 
and PM emissions from RICE engines would be affected by this rule.  Information regarding the 
health effects of these compounds can be found in EPA’s IRIS database.59 
The distance that these HAPs travel away from the emission source depends on several 
factors.  HAPs such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, PAHs, and acrolein are emitted as gases.  
Regional photochemical model simulations, examining particular scenarios,  have shown that 
gaseous HAPs like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde can be transported hundreds of kilometers 
from their emissions source in distinct plumes (U.S. EPA, 2010b).  Further, these emissions can 
contribute to regional airmasses with elevated concentrations of gaseous HAPs.  These polluted 
airmasses can be transported thousands of kilometers and affect locations well distant from the 
original emissions source.  Some gaseous HAPs with higher molecular weight, such as toluene, 
can transform into particles in the atmosphere.  For engines examined in this rule, EPA does not 
have enough information to determine the extent of transport specific to the HAPs.  In general, 
for HAPs emitted as particles, such as metals, the travel distance primarily depends on the size of 
the particle and meteorological conditions, such as wind speed and precipitation.  Fine particles 
can have an atmospheric half-life of days to weeks and travel hundreds to thousands of 
kilometers, whereas ultrafine and coarse particles travel less than ten kilometers (U.S. EPA, 
2009c).   
Carbon monoxide co-benefits 
Carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is associated with a variety of health effects.  Without 
knowing the location of the emission reductions and the resulting ambient concentrations using 
fine-scale air quality modeling, we were unable to estimate the exposure to CO for nearby 
populations.  Due to data limitations, we were unable to estimate the benefits associated with the 
14,000 tons reductions in CO emissions that would occur as a result of this rule.   
Carbon monoxide in ambient air is formed primarily by the incomplete combustion of 
carbon-containing fuels and photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. The amount of CO 
emitted from these reactions, relative to carbon dioxide (CO2), is sensitive to conditions in the 
combustion zone, such as fuel oxygen content, burn temperature, or mixing time.  Upon 
                                                 
59 U.S. EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database is available at:  http://www.epa.gov/iris  
 7-19 
inhalation, CO diffuses through the respiratory system to the blood, which can cause hypoxia 
(reduced oxygen availability).  Carbon monoxide can elicit a broad range of effects in multiple 
tissues and organ systems that are dependent upon concentration and duration of exposure.  
The Integrated Science Assessment for Carbon Monoxide (U.S. EPA, 2010a) concluded 
that short-term exposure to CO is “likely to have a causal relationship” with cardiovascular 
morbidity, particularly in individuals with coronary heart disease. Epidemiologic studies 
associate short-term CO exposure with increased risk of emergency department visits and 
hospital admissions.  Coronary heart disease includes those who have angina pectoris (cardiac 
chest pain), as well as those who have experienced a heart attack. Other subpopulations 
potentially at risk include individuals with diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), anemia, or diabetes, and individuals in very early or late life stages, such as 
older adults or the developing young. The evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship from 
short-term exposure to CO with respiratory morbidity and mortality, from long-term exposure to 
CO with adverse birth outcomes and developmental effects, and from short- and long-term 
exposure to CO with central nervous system effects.  
Other SO2co- benefits 
In addition to being a precursor to PM2.5, SO2 emissions are also associated with a variety 
of respiratory health effects.  Unfortunately, we were unable to estimate the health benefits 
associated with reduced SO2 exposure in this analysis because we do not have air quality 
modeling data available.  Without knowing the location of the 31,000 tons of SO2 emission 
reductions and the resulting ambient concentrations, we were unable to estimate the exposure to 
SO2 for nearby populations.  Therefore, this analysis only quantifies and monetizes the PM2.5 co-
benefits associated with those SO2 emissions reductions.   
Following an extensive evaluation of health evidence from epidemiologic and laboratory 
studies, the U.S. EPA has concluded that there is a causal relationship between respiratory health 
effects and short-term exposure to SO2 (U.S. EPA, 2008b).  The immediate effect of SO2 on the 
respiratory system in humans is bronchoconstriction.  Asthmatics are more sensitive to the 
effects of SO2 likely resulting from preexisting inflammation associated with this disease.  A 
clear concentration-response relationship has been demonstrated in laboratory studies following 
exposures to SO2 at concentrations between 20 and 100 ppb, both in terms of increasing severity 
of effect and percentage of asthmatics adversely affected. The SO2 ISA identified four short-term 
morbidity endpoints with a “causal relationship”: asthma exacerbation, respiratory-related 
emergency department visits, and respiratory-related hospitalizations.  The SO2 ISA also 
 7-20 
concluded that the relationship between short-term SO2 exposure and premature mortality was 
“suggestive of a causal relationship” because it is difficult to attribute the mortality risk effects to 
SO2 alone.  Although the SO2 ISA stated that studies are generally consistent in reporting a 
relationship between SO2 exposure and mortality, there was a lack of robustness of the observed 
associations to adjustment for co-pollutants.  The differing evidence and associated strength of 
the evidence for these different effects is described in detail in the SO2 ISA.   
SO2 emissions also contribute to adverse welfare effects from acidic deposition, mercury 
methylation, and visibility impairment. Sulfur deposition causes acidification, leading to a loss of 
biodiversity of fishes, zooplankton, and macro invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems, as well as a 
decline in sensitive tree species, such as red spruce (Picea rubens) and sugar maple (Acer 
saccharum) in terrestrial ecosystems.  In the northeastern United States, the surface waters 
affected by acidification are a source of food for some recreational and subsistence fishermen 
and support several cultural services, including aesthetic and educational services and 
recreational fishing. Biological effects of acidification in terrestrial ecosystems are generally 
linked to aluminum toxicity, which can reduce root growth and restrict the ability of the plant to 
take up water and nutrients.  These direct effects increase the sensitivity of these plants to 
stresses, such as droughts, cold temperatures, insect pests, and disease leading to increased 
mortality of canopy trees.  Terrestrial acidification affects several important ecological services, 
including declines in forest productivity (provisioning), declines in habitat for threatened and 
endangered species (cultural), declines in forest aesthetics (cultural), and increases in forest soil 
erosion and reductions in water retention (cultural and regulating).  (U.S. EPA, 2008c) 
Mercury is a highly neurotoxic contaminant that enters the food web as a methylated 
compound, methylmercury (U.S. EPA, 2008c).  The contaminant is concentrated in higher 
trophic levels, including fish eaten by humans.  Experimental evidence has established that only 
inconsequential amounts of methylmercury can be produced in the absence of sulfate.  Current 
evidence indicates that in watersheds where mercury is present, increased SOx deposition very 
likely results in methylmercury accumulation in fish (Drevnick et al., 2007; Munthe et al, 2007).  
The SO2 ISA concluded that evidence is sufficient to infer a casual relationship between sulfur 
deposition and increased mercury methylation in wetlands and aquatic environments.  
Reducing SO2 emissions and the secondary formation of PM2.5 would improve the level 
of visibility throughout the United States.  Fine particles with significant light-extinction 
efficiencies include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and soil.  These 
suspended particles and gases degrade visibility by scattering and absorbing light.  Higher 
visibility impairment levels in the East are due to generally higher concentrations of fine 
 7-21 
particles, particularly sulfates, and higher average relative humidity levels.  In fact, particulate 
sulfate is the largest contributor to regional haze in the eastern U.S. (i.e., 40% or more annually 
and 75% during summer).  In the western U.S., particulate sulfate contributes to 20-50% of 
regional haze.  Visibility has direct significance to people’s enjoyment of daily activities and 
their overall sense of wellbeing.  Good visibility increases the quality of life where individuals 
live and work, and where they engage in recreational activities.  (U.S. EPA, 2009c) 
 
7.4 Characterization of Uncertainty in the Monetized Co-benefits 
 
In any complex analysis, there are likely to be many sources of uncertainty. Many inputs 
are used to derive the final estimate of economic benefits, including emission inventories, air 
quality models (with their associated parameters and inputs), epidemiological estimates of 
concentration-response (C-R) functions, estimates of values, population estimates, income 
estimates, and estimates of the future state of the world (i.e., regulations, technology, and human 
behavior). For some parameters or inputs it may be possible to provide a statistical representation 
of the underlying uncertainty distribution. For other parameters or inputs, the necessary 
information is not available.  
 
The annual benefit estimates presented in this analysis are also inherently variable due to 
the processes that govern pollutant emissions and ambient air quality in a given year. Factors 
such as hours of equipment use and weather are constantly variable, regardless of our ability to 
measure them accurately. As discussed in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5) (U.S. EPA, 2006), 
there are a variety of uncertainties associated with these PM co-benefits. Therefore, the estimates  
of annual co-benefits should be viewed as representative of the magnitude of co-benefits 
expected, rather than the actual benefits that would occur every year. 
We performed a couple of sensitivity analyses on the benefits results to assess the 
sensitivity of the primary results to various data inputs and assumptions. We then changed each 
default input one at a time and recalculated the total monetized co-benefits to assess the percent 
change from the default. We present the results of this sensitivity analysis in Table 7-5. We 
indicated each input parameter, the value used as the default, and the values for the sensitivity 
analyses, and then we provide the total monetary co-benefits for each input and the percent 
change from the default value.

Above we present the estimates of the total monetized co-benefits, based on our 
interpretation of the best available scientific literature and methods and supported by the SAB-
HES and the NAS (NRC, 2002). The co-benefits estimates are subject to a number of 
assumptions and uncertainties. For example, for key assumptions underlying the estimates for 
premature mortality, which typically account for at least 90% of the total monetized benefits, we 
were able to quantify include the following:  
1. PM2.5 co-benefits were derived through benefit per-ton estimates, which do not reflect 
local variability in population density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health 
incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an over-estimate or under-
estimate of the actual benefits of controlling directly emitted fine particulates.  
2. We assume that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, are 
equally potent in causing premature mortality. This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 produced via transported precursors emitted from EGUs may differ 
significantly from direct PM2.5 released from diesel engines and other industrial 
sources, but no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting differential effects 
estimates by particle type.  
3. We assume that the health impact function for fine particles is linear down to the 
lowest air quality levels modeled in this analysis. Thus, the estimates include health 
benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied concentrations of PM2.5, 
including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and those that 
do not meet the standard down to the lowest modeled concentrations.  
4. To characterize the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 and premature 
mortality (which typically accounts for 85% to 95% of total monetized benefits), we 
include a set of twelve estimates based on results of the expert elicitation study in 
 7-23 
addition to our core estimates. Even these multiple characterizations omit the 
uncertainty in air quality estimates, baseline incidence rates, populations exposed and 
transferability of the effect estimate to diverse locations. As a result, the reported 
confidence intervals and range of estimates give an incomplete picture about the 
overall uncertainty in the PM2.5 estimates. This information should be interpreted 
within the context of the larger uncertainty surrounding the entire analysis. For more 
information on the uncertainties associated with PM2.5 co-benefits, please consult the 
PM2.5 NAAQS RIA (Table 5.5). 
This RIA does not include the type of detailed uncertainty assessment found in the PM 
NAAQS RIA (U.S. EPA, 2006b) because we lack the necessary air quality input and monitoring 
data to run the benefits model. Moreover, it was not possible to develop benefit-per-ton metrics 
and associated estimates of uncertainty using the benefits estimates from the PM RIA because of 
the significant differences between the sources affected in that rule and those regulated here. 
However, the results of the Monte Carlo analyses of the health and welfare benefits presented in 
Chapter 5 of the PM RIA can provide some evidence of the uncertainty surrounding the co-
benefits results presented in this analysis.  
It is important to note that the monetized benefit-per-ton estimates used here reflect 
specific geographic patterns of emissions reductions and specific air quality and benefits 
modeling assumptions. For example, these estimates do not reflect local variability in population 
density, meteorology, exposure, baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors.  Use of 
these $/ton values to estimate co-benefits associated with different emission control programs 
(e.g., for reducing emissions from large stationary sources like EGUs) may lead to higher or 
lower benefit estimates than if co-benefits were calculated based on direct air quality modeling. 
Great care should be taken in applying these estimates to emission reductions occurring in any 
specific location, as these are all based on national or broad regional emission reduction 
programs and therefore represent average benefits-per-ton over the entire United States. The 
benefits- per-ton for emission reductions in specific locations may be very different than the 
estimates presented here.  
7.5 Comparison of Benefits and Costs 
EPA estimates the range of co-benefits of this final rule to be $940 million to $2.3 billion 
(2008$) at a 3% discount rate and $850 million to $2.1 billion at a 7% discount rate in the year of 
implementation (2013). The annualized costs are $373 million (2008$) at a 7% interest rate.60 
Thus, net benefits are $570 million to $1.9 billion at a 3% discount rate for the benefits and $480 
million to $1.7 billion at a 7% discount rate. Figures 7-4 and 7-5 show the full range of net 
                                                 
60For more information on the annualized costs, please refer to Section 4 of this RIA. 
 7-24 
benefits estimates (i.e., annual co-benefits minus annualized costs) utilizing the 14 different 
PM2.5 mortality functions at discount rates of 3% and 7%. In addition, the benefits from reducing 
1,014 tons of hazardous air pollutants each year have not been included in these estimates. EPA 
believes that the benefits are likely to exceed the costs under this rulemaking even when taking 
into account uncertainties in the cost and benefit estimates.
