FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Captain William Blanche, TRICARE 
Management Activity, telephone (703)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Background 
Section 703 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 
(NDAA–08) (Pub. L. 110–181) enacted 
10 U.S.C. 1074g(f). It provides that with 
respect to any prescription filled on or 
after the date of enactment of the 
NDAA, the TRRx shall be treated as an 
element of the DoD for purposes of 
procurement of drugs by Federal 
agencies under section 8126 of title 38, 
United States Code (U.S.C.), to the 
extent necessary to ensure 
pharmaceuticals paid for by the DoD 
that are provided by network retail 
pharmacies under the program to 
eligible covered beneficiaries are subject 
to the pricing standards in such section 
8126. NDAA–08 was enacted on January 
28, 2008. The statute requires 
implementing regulations. 
The Veterans Health Care Act (VHCA) 
of 1992, codified at 38 U.S.C. 8126, 
established Federal Ceiling Prices 
(FCPs) of covered pharmaceuticals 
(requiring a minimum 24% discount off 
non-Federal average manufacturing 
prices—‘‘non-FAMP’’) procured by the 
four designated agencies covered in the 
Act: Department of Veterans Affairs 
(VA), DoD, Coast Guard, and the Public 
Health Service/Indian Health Service. 
The non-FAMP is the average price paid 
to the manufacturer by wholesalers (or, 
if there are insufficient wholesale sales, 
others who purchase directly from the 
manufacturer) for drugs distributed to 
non-federal purchasers, taking into 
account any cash discounts or similar 
reductions given to those purchasers. 
The VA administers the VHCA discount 
program on behalf of the four specified 
agencies. The DoD consulted closely 
with the VA in the development of this 
proposed rule. 
The TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits 
Program operates under the authority of 
10 U.S.C. 1074g. It provides outpatient 
drugs to TRICARE beneficiaries through 
Military Treatment Facility (MTF) 
pharmacies, the TRICARE mail order 
pharmacy program (TMOP), and a TRRx 
consisting of TRICARE Retail Pharmacy 
Network and retail non-network 
pharmacies. As implemented, the new 
statutory requirement will only apply to 
pharmaceuticals paid for by DoD and 
provided to eligible beneficiaries 
through the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy 
Network. 
The TRICARE Retail Pharmacy 
Network is managed under a single 
Pharmacy Benefits Manager contract, 
linked to the DoD Pharmacy Benefits 
Office, and enabled by a management 
information system to verify beneficiary 
eligibility, check for potential drug 
interactions, and authorize payment for 
the pharmaceuticals used to fill the 
beneficiary’s prescription. The 
management information system also 
records data on all prescriptions filled 
through the Retail Pharmacy Network, 
permitting an accurate accounting of all 
retail network pharmaceuticals paid for 
by DoD under the TRICARE Pharmacy 
Benefits Program. Since the beginning of 
the FCP program, outpatient 
pharmaceuticals provided by DoD 
through MTF pharmacies have been 
subject to FCPs, as have those under the 
TMOP program since it began. 
Implementation of similar applicability 
to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy 
Network component of the Program is 
the subject of this proposed regulation. 
B. Provisions of the Rule 
The proposed rule would add a new 
paragraph (q) to § 199.21. Paragraph 
(q)(1) repeats the new statutory 
requirement. Paragraph (q)(2) provides 
that an agreement by a manufacturer to 
honor the FCPs in the Retail Pharmacy 
Network component of the Pharmacy 
Benefits Program is a condition of 
inclusion of a drug on the uniform 
formulary. Further, it states that a drug 
not under such an agreement requires 
preauthorization to be provided through 
the Retail Pharmacy Network. In 
addition, it indicates that drugs covered 
by this requirement are TRICARE Retail 
Pharmacy Network provided drugs that 
are covered by the VA’s FCP program, 
except any prescription for which the 
TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program is 
the second payer. While DoD proposes 
in this rulemaking to enter into 
voluntary agreements with 
manufacturers that would make 
prescriptions filled on or after the date 
of enactment of NDAA–08 subject to 
FCPs, the Department solicits comment 
regarding any other appropriate and 
legally permissible implementation 
approach and/or date from which to 
begin making prescriptions filled in the 
Retail Pharmacy Network subject to 
FCPs. DoD is specifically interested in 
the legal justification, including under 
section 703 of NDAA–08, for any 
alternative implementation approaches 
and/or dates that commenters may 
propose. 
Paragraph (q)(3) establishes refund 
procedures to, in the words of the 
statute, ‘‘ensure that pharmaceuticals 
paid for by the DoD that are provided 
by pharmacies under the program to 
eligible covered beneficiaries under this 
section are subject to the pricing 
standards’’ of the FCP program. The 
refund procedures will, to the extent 
practicable, incorporate common 
industry practices for implementing 
pricing agreements between 
manufacturers and large pharmacy 
benefit plan sponsors. Such procedures 
shall provide the manufacturer at least 
70 days from the date of submission by 
TMA to the manufacturer (initially 
expected to be on a quarterly basis) of 
the TRICARE pharmaceutical utilization 
data needed to calculate the refund 
before the refund payment is due. The 
basis of the refund will be the difference 
between the average non-federal price of 
the drug sold by the manufacturer to 
wholesalers, as represented by the most 
recent annual non-FAMP (reported to 
VA) and the FCP or, in the discretion of 
the manufacturer, the difference 
between FCP and direct commercial 
contract sales prices specifically 
attributable to TRICARE paid 
pharmaceuticals, determined for each 
applicable National Drug Code (NDC) 
listing. Further, this paragraph of the 
rule provides that a refund due under 
the statute is subject to the overpayment 
recovery procedures of § 199.11 of the 
TRICARE regulation. 
Finally, paragraph (q)(4) states that in 
the case of the failure of a manufacturer 
of a covered drug to make or honor an 
agreement to ensure that DoD pays no 
more than the FCP for covered drugs 
provided through the TRICARE Retail 
Pharmacy Network component of the 
program, the Director, TMA, in addition

43396 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 144 / Friday, July 25, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
to other actions referred to in the rule, 
may take any other action authorized by 
law. 
C. Regulatory Procedures 
Executive Order 12866, ‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review’’ 
Executive Order (EO) 12866 requires 
that a comprehensive regulatory impact 
analysis be performed on any 
economically significant regulatory 
action, defined primarily as one that 
would result in an effect of $100 million 
or more in any one year. The DoD has 
examined the economic, legal, and 
policy implications of this proposed 
rule and has concluded that it is an 
economically significant regulatory 
action under section 3(f)(1) of the EO. 
The economic impact of applying 
Federal Ceiling Prices to the TRICARE 
Retail Pharmacy Network is in the form 
of reducing the prices of drugs paid for 
by DoD in the retail pharmacy 
component of the TRICARE Pharmacy 
Benefits Program, making them 
comparable to the prices paid by DoD in 
the Military Treatment Facility and Mail 
Order Pharmacy components of the 
program. 
A recent Government Accountability 
Office Report, ‘‘DoD Pharmacy Program: 
Continued Efforts Needed to Reduce 
Growth in Spending at Retail 
Pharmacies,’’ April 2008 (GAO–08– 
327), found that DoD’s drug spending 
‘‘more than tripled from $1.6 billion in 
fiscal year 2000 to $6.2 billion in fiscal 
year 2006’’ and that retail pharmacy 
spending ‘‘drove most of this increase, 
rising almost nine-fold from $455 
million to $3.9 billion and growing from 
29 percent of overall drug spending to 
63 percent.’’ DoD concurs in these 
findings. The principal economic 
impact of this proposed rule is to 
moderate somewhat the rate of growth 
in the retail pharmacy component of the 
program. 
DoD has estimated the reduced 
spending associated applying Federal 
Ceiling Prices to the Retail Pharmacy 
Network. DoD funds the Military Health 
System through two separate 
mechanisms. One is the Defense Health 
Program (DHP) appropriation, which 
pays for health care for all beneficiaries 
except those who are also eligible for 
Medicare. DoD-funded health care for 
DoD beneficiaries who are also eligible 
for Medicare is paid for by way of an 
accrual fund called the Medicare- 
Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund 
(MERHCF) under 10 U.S.C Chapter 56. 
Funds are paid into the MERHCF from 
military personnel appropriations and 
the general U.S. treasury. DoD estimated 
cost reductions from applying Federal 
Ceiling Prices to the TRICARE Retail 
Pharmacy Network in Fiscal Years 2009 
through 2011 are: 
Millions 
FY–2009 DHP Reduced Spend-
ing ........................................... $352 
FY–2009 MERHCF Reduced 
Spending ................................. 367 
FY–2010 DHP Reduced Spend-
ing ........................................... 388 
FY–2010 MERHCF Reduced 
Spending ................................. 404 
FY–2011 DHP Reduced Spend-
ing ........................................... 427 
FY–2011 MERHCF Reduced 
Spending ................................. 444 
As a frame of reference, total TRICARE 
Pharmacy Benefits Program spending 
(incorporating these spending 
reductions) is estimated to be $8 billion 
in FY–2009, $8.4 billion in FY–2010, 
and $9.3 billion in FY–2011. 
Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801, 
et seq. 
Under the Congressional Review Act, 
a major rule may not take effect until at 
least 60 days after submission to 
Congress of a report regarding the rule. 
A major rule is one that would have an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more or have certain other 
impacts. This proposed rule is a major 
rule under the Congressional Review 
Act. As noted above, applying Federal 
Ceiling Prices to the TRICARE Retail 
Pharmacy Network will reduce DoD 
spending on pharmaceuticals by more 
than $100 million per year. 
Sec. 202, Pub. L. 104–4, ‘‘Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act’’ 
This rule does not contain a Federal 
mandate that may result in the 
expenditure by State, local and tribunal 
governments, in aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million or more 
(adjusted for inflation) in any one year. 
Public Law 96–354, ‘‘Regulatory 
Flexibility Act’’ (5 U.S.C. 601) 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires that each Federal agency 
prepare and make available for public 
comment, a regulatory flexibility 
analysis when the agency issues a 
regulation which would have a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. DoD does not 
anticipate that this regulation will result 
in changes that would impact small 
entities, including retail pharmacies, 
whose reimbursements are not affected 
by the proposed rule. In addition, drugs 
newly subject to implementation of 
Federal Ceiling Prices under the 
proposed rule represent less than 2% of 
manufacturers’ prescription drug sales. 
Therefore, this proposed rule is not 
expected to result in significant impacts 
on a substantial number of small 
entities. 
Public Law 96–511, ‘‘Paperwork 
Reduction Act’’ (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) 
This proposed rule contains 
information collection requirements 
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501–3511). 
This consists of responding to the 
periodic TMA report of the TRICARE 
prescription utilization data needed to 
calculate the refund. This information 
collection has been approved with OMB 
Control Number 0720–0032. No person 
is required to respond to, nor shall any 
person be subject to a penalty for failure 
to comply with, a collection of 
information subject to the requirements 
of the PRA, unless that collection of 
information displays a currently valid 
OMB Control Number. 
Executive Order 13132, ‘‘Federalism’’ 
This proposed rule does not have 
federalism implications, as set forth in 
Executive Order 13132. This rule does 
not have substantial direct effects on the 
States; the relationship between the 
National Government and the States; or 
the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of Government. 
Public Comments Invited 
This is a proposed rule. DoD invites 
public comments on all of its 
provisions.

43397 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 144 / Friday, July 25, 2008 / Proposed Rules 
DoD for purposes of the procurement of 
drugs by Federal agencies under 38 
U.S.C. 8126 to the extent necessary to 
ensure pharmaceuticals paid for by the 
DoD that are provided by pharmacies 
under the program to eligible covered 
beneficiaries under this section are 
subject to the pricing standards in such 
section 8126. 
(2) Manufacturer written agreement. 
(i) A written agreement by a 
manufacturer to honor the pricing 
standards required by 10 U.S.C. 1074g(f) 
and referred to in paragraph (q)(1) of 
this section for pharmaceuticals 
provided through retail network 
pharmacies shall with respect to a 
particular covered drug be a condition 
for: 
(A) Inclusion of that drug on the 
uniform formulary under this section; 
and 
(B) Availability of that drug through 
retail network pharmacies without 
preauthorization under paragraph (k) of 
this section. 
(ii) A covered drug not under an 
agreement under paragraph (q)(2)(i) of 
this section requires preauthorization 
under paragraph (k) of this section to be 
provided through a retail network 
pharmacy under the Pharmacy Benefits 
Program. This preauthorization 
requirement does not apply to other 
points of service under the Pharmacy 
Benefits Program. 
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph 
(q)(2), a covered drug does not include: 
(A) A drug that is not a covered drug 
under 38 U.S.C. 8126; 
(B) A drug provided under a 
prescription that is not covered by 10 
U.S.C. 1074g(f); 
(C) A drug that is not provided 
through a retail network pharmacy 
under this section; 
(D) Any pharmaceutical for which the 
TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program is 
the second payer under paragraph (m) of 
this section; and 
(E) Any other exception, consistent 
with law, established by the Director, 
TMA. 
(3) Refund procedures. (i) The 
agreement referred to in paragraph (q)(2) 
of this section shall include refund 
procedures to ensure that 
pharmaceuticals paid for by the DoD 
that are provided by retail network 
pharmacies under the pharmacy 
benefits program are subject to the 
pricing standards referred to in 
paragraph (q)(1) of this section. 
(ii) The refund procedures referred to 
in paragraph (q)(3)(i) of this section 
shall, to the extent practicable, 
incorporate common industry practices 
for implementing pricing agreements 
between manufacturers and large 
pharmacy benefit plan sponsors. Such 
procedures shall provide the 
manufacturer at least 70 days from the 
date of the submission of the TRICARE 
pharmaceutical utilization data needed 
to calculate the refund before the refund 
payment is due. The basis of the refund 
will be the difference between the 
average non-federal price of the drug 
sold by the manufacturer to wholesalers, 
as represented by the most recent 
annual non-Federal average 
manufacturing prices (non-FAMP) 
(reported to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA)) and the FCP or, in the 
discretion of the manufacturer, the 
difference between the FCP and direct 
commercial contract sales prices 
specifically attributable to the reported 
TRICARE paid pharmaceuticals, 
determined for each applicable NDC 
listing. 
(iii) A refund due under this 
paragraph (q) is subject to § 199.11 of 
this part. 
(4) Remedies. In the case of the failure 
of a manufacturer of a covered drug to 
make or honor an agreement under this 
paragraph (q), the Director, TMA, in 
addition to other actions referred to in 
this paragraph (q), may take any other 
action authorized by law.
