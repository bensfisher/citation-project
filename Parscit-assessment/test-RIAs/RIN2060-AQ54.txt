Executive Summary

Executive Summary 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) are issuing a joint proposal to establish new standards for 
light-duty highway vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel 
economy.  The joint proposed rulemaking is consistent with the Presidential Memorandum 
issued by President Obama on May 21, 2010, requesting that NHTSA and EPA develop 
through notice and comment rulemaking a coordinated National Program to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and improve the fuel economy of light-duty vehicles for model 
years 2017-2025.  This proposal, consistent with the President’s request, responds to the 
country’s critical need to address global climate change and to reduce oil consumption.  .  
EPA is proposing greenhouse gas emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, and NHTSA 
is proposing Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards under the Energy Policy and 
Conservation Act, as amended.  These standards apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, 
and medium-duty passenger vehicles, covering model years 2017 through 2025. They require 
these vehicles to meet an estimated combined average emissions level of 163 grams of CO2 
per mile in MY 2025 under EPA’s GHG program, and 49.6 mpg in MY 2025 under 
NHTSA’s CAFE program and represent a harmonized and consistent national program 
(National Program).  These standards are designed such that compliance can be achieved with 
a single national vehicle fleet whose emissions and fuel economy performance improves each 
year from MY2017 to 2025.  This document describes the supporting technical analysis for 
areas of these jointly proposed rules which are consistent between the two agencies. 
NHTSA and EPA have coordinated closely to create a nationwide joint fuel economy 
and GHG program based on consistent compliance structures and technical assumptions.  To 
the extent permitted under each Agency’s statutes, NHTSA and EPA have incorporated the 
same compliance flexibilities, such as averaging, banking, and trading of credits, off-cycle 
credits, and the same testing protocol for determining the agencies’ respective fleet-wide 
average proposed standards.  In addition, the agencies have worked together to create a 
common baseline fleet and to harmonize most of the costs and benefit inputs used in the 
agencies’ respective modeling processes for this joint proposed rule. 
  Chapter 1 of this Draft TSD provides an explanation of the agencies’ 
methodology used to develop the baseline and reference case vehicle fleets, including the 
technology composition of these fleets, and how the agencies projected vehicle sales into the 
future.  One of the fundamental features of this technical analysis is the development of these 
fleets, which are used by both agencies in their respective models.  In order to determine 
technology costs associated with this joint rulemaking, it is necessary to consider the vehicle 
fleet absent a rulemaking as a “business as usual” comparison.  In past CAFE rulemakings, 
NHTSA has used confidential product plans submitted by vehicle manufacturers to develop 
the reference case fleet.  In responding to comments from these previous rulemakings that the 
agencies make these fleets available for public review, the agencies created a new 
methodology for creating baseline and reference fleets using data, the vast majority of which 
is publicly available.   
Executive Summary

 Chapter 2 of this document discusses how NHTSA and EPA developed the 
mathematical functions which provide the bases for the proposed car and truck standards.  
NHTSA and EPA worked together closely to develop regulatory approaches that are 
fundamentally the same, and have chosen to use an attribute-based program structure based 
on the footprint attribute, similar to the mathematical functions used in the MYs 2012-2016 
rule.  The agencies revisited other attributes as candidates for the standard functions, but 
concluded that footprint remains the best option for balancing the numerous technical and 
social factors.  However, the agencies did adjust the shape of the truck footprint curve, in 
comparison to the MYs 2012-2016 rule.  The agencies also modified the way the car and 
truck curves change from year to year compared to the MYs 2012-2016 rule.  In determining 
the shape of the footprint curve, the agencies considered factors such as the magnitudes of 
CO2 reduction and fuel savings, how much that shape may incentivize manufacturers to 
comply in a manner which circumvents the overall goals of the joint program, whether the 
standards’ stringencies are technically attainable, the utility of vehicles, and the mathematical 
flexibilities inherent to the statistical fitting of such a function. 
Chapter 3 contains a detailed analysis of NHTSA and EPA’s technology assumptions 
on which the proposed regulations were based.  Because the majority of technologies that 
reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy are identical, it was crucial that NHTSA 
and EPA use common assumptions for values pertaining to technology availability, cost, and 
effectiveness.  The agencies collaborated closely in determining which technologies would be 
considered in the rulemaking, how much these technologies would cost the manufacturers 
(directly) in the time frame of the proposed rules, how these costs will be adjusted for learning 
as well as for indirect cost multipliers, and how effective the technologies are at 
accomplishing the goals of improving fuel efficiency and GHG emissions.   
Chapter 4 of this document provides a full description and analysis of the economic 
factors considered in this joint proposal.  EPA and NHTSA harmonized many inputs 
capturing economic and social factors, such as the discount rates, fuel prices, social costs of 
carbon, the magnitude of the rebound effect, the value of refueling time, and the social cost of 
importing oil and fuel.   
Chapter 5 of this draft TSD discusses proposed adjustments and credits to reflect 
technologies that improve air conditioner efficiency, that improve efficiency under other off-
cycle driving conditions, and that reduce leakage of air conditioner refrigerants that contribute 
to global warming.  The air conditioner credits are similar to the MYs 2012-2016 rule, with 
two notable exceptions: NHTSA is proposing to allow A/C efficiency improvements to help 
come into compliance with fuel economy standards, and a new air conditioner test procedure 
is introduced to help capture efficiency credits.  NHTSA is now also allowing off-cycle 
improvements to help manufacturers come into compliance with fuel economy standards.  A 
list of some technologies and their credits and a streamlined methodology is provided by the 
agencies to help simplify the credit generating process.  Chapter 5 also discusses proposed 
adjustments to encourage “game changing” technologies (such as hybridized powertrains) for 
full-size pickup trucks.

The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-1 
 
Chapter 1:  The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
The passenger cars and light trucks sold currently in the United States, and those 
which are anticipated to be sold in the MYs 2017-2025 timeframe, are highly varied and 
satisfy a wide range of consumer needs.  From two-seater miniature cars to 11-seater 
passenger vans to large extended cab pickup trucks, American consumers have a great 
number of vehicle options to accommodate their needs and preferences.  Recent volatility in 
oil prices and the state of the economy have demonstrated that consumer demand and choice 
of vehicles within this wide range can be sensitive to these factors.  Although it is impossible 
to precisely predict the future, the agencies need to characterize and quantify the future fleet 
in order to assess the impacts of rules that would affect that future fleet.  The agencies have 
examined various publicly-available sources, and then used inputs from those sources in a 
series of models to project the composition of a baseline and reference fleet for purposes of 
this analysis.  This chapter describes this process. 
The agencies have made every effort to make this analysis transparent and duplicablea.  
Because both the input and output sheets from our modeling are public,1 stakeholders can 
verify and check NHTSA’s and EPA’s modeling, and perform their own analyses with these 
datasets.   
 
1.1 Why do the agencies establish a baseline and reference vehicle fleet? 
In order to calculate the impacts of the proposed future GHG and CAFE standards, it is 
necessary to estimate the composition of the future vehicle fleet absent those proposed 
standards in order to conduct comparisons.  EPA and NHTSA have developed a comparison 
fleet in two parts.  The first step was to develop a baseline fleet based on model year 2008 
data, discussed further below.  NHTSA and EPA create a baseline fleet in order to track the 
volumes and types of fuel economy-improving and CO2-reducing technologies which are 
already present in the existing vehicle fleet.  Creating a baseline fleet helps to keep, to some 
extent, the agencies’ models from adding technologies to vehicles that already have these 
technologies, which would result in “double counting” of technologies’ costs and benefits.  
The second step was to project the baseline fleet sales into MYs 2017-2025.  This is called the 
reference fleet, and it represents the fleet volumes (but, until later steps, not levels of 
technology) that the agencies believe would exist in MYs 2017-2025 absent any change due 
to regulation in 2017-2025.   
                                                 
a
 In endeavoring to be transparent and duplicable in every aspect of the analysis supporting the joint proposed 
rules discussed in this TSD, the agencies seek to facilitate public participation in the rulemaking process 
consistent with Executive Order 13563 (76 Fed. Reg. 3821, Jan. 21, 2011) and OMB Circular A-4 (September 
17, 2003, available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a004_a-4/ (last accessed Aug. 15, 2011)). 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet

After determining the reference fleet, a third step is needed to account for technologies 
(and corresponding increases in cost and reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) 
that could be added to MY 2008-technology vehicles in the future, taking into account 
previously-promulgated standards, and assuming MY 2016 standards are extended through 
MY2025.  This step uses the Omega and Volpe models to add technologies to that MY 2008-
based market forecast such that each manufacturer’s car and truck CAFE and average CO2 
levels reflect baseline standards.  The models’ output, the reference case, is the light-duty fleet 
estimated to exist in MYs 2017-2025 without new GHG/CAFE standards covering MYs 
2017-2025.  All of the agencies’ estimates of emission reductions/fuel economy 
improvements, costs, and societal impacts for purposes of this NPRM are developed in 
relation to the agencies’ reference cases.  This chapter describes the first two steps of the 
development of the baseline and reference fleets.  The third step of technology addition is 
developed separately by each agency as the outputs of the OMEGA and Volpe models (see 
Chapter 3 of the TSD for an explanation of how the models apply technologies to vehicles in 
order to evaluate potential paths to compliance). 
1.2 The 2008 baseline vehicle fleet 
1.2.1 Why did the agencies choose 2008 as the baseline model year? 
The baseline that EPA developed in consultation with NHTSA for the 2012-2016 final 
rule was comprised of model year 2008 CAFE compliance data (specifically, individual 
vehicles with sales volumes disaggregated at the level of specific engine/transmission 
combinations) submitted by manufacturers to EPA, in part because full MY 2009 data was not 
available at the time.  For this NPRM, the agencies chose again to use MY 2008 vehicle data 
as the basis of the baseline fleet, but for different reasons than in the 2012-2016 final rule.  
First, MY 2008 is now the most recent model year for which the industry had what the 
agencies would consider to be “normal” sales.  Complete MY 2009 data is now available for 
the industry, but the agencies believe that the model year was disrupted by the economic 
downturn and the bankruptcies of both General Motors and Chrysler.  CAFE compliance data 
shows that there was a significant reduction in the number of vehicles sold by both companies 
and by the industry as a whole.  These abnormalities led the agencies to conclude that MY 
2009 data was likely not representative for projecting the future fleet for purposes of this 
analysis.  And second, while MY 2010 data is likely more representative for projecting the 
future fleet, it was not complete and available in time for it to be used for the NPRM analysis.  
Therefore, for purposes of the NPRM analysis, the agencies chose to use MY 2008 CAFE 
compliance data for the baseline since it was the latest, most representative transparent data 
set that we had available.  However, the agencies plan to use the MY 2010 data, if available, 
to develop an updated market forecast for use in the final rule.  To the extent the MY 2010 
data becomes available within the time frame of the comment period for this proposal the 
agencies will place a copy of this data into each agencies docket. 
 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-3 
 
1.2.2 On what data is the baseline vehicle fleet based? 
As part of the CAFE program, EPA measures vehicle CO2 emissions and converts 
them to mpg, and generates and maintains the federal fuel economy database.  See 49 U.S.C 
32904 and 40 CFR Part 600.  Most of the information about the vehicles that make up the 
2008 fleet was gathered from EPA’s emission certification and fuel economy database, most 
of which is available to the public.  These data included, by individual vehicle model 
produced in MY 2008,  vehicle production volume, fuel economy rating for CAFE 
certification (i.e., on the 2-cycle city-highway test), carbon dioxide emissions (equivalent to 
fuel economy rating for CAFE certification), fuel type (gasoline, diesel, and/or alternative 
fuel), number of engine cylinders, displacement, valves per cylinder, engine cycle, 
transmission type, drive (rear-wheel, all-wheel, etc.), hybrid type (if applicable), and 
aspiration (naturally-aspirated, turbocharged, etc.).  In addition to this information about each 
vehicle model produced in MY 2008, the agencies also need information about the fuel 
economy-improving/CO2-reducing technologies already on those vehicle models in order to 
assess how much and which technologies to apply to determine a path toward future 
compliance.  However, EPA’s certification database does not include a detailed description of 
the types of fuel economy-improving/CO2-reducing technologies considered in this NPRM 
because this level of information was not reported in MY 2008 for emission certification or 
fuel economy testing.  Thus, the agencies augmented this description with publicly-available 
data which includes more complete technology descriptions from Ward’s Automotive 
Group.b,c  The agencies also need information about the footprints of MY 2008 vehicles in 
order to create potential target curves (as discussed in Chapter 2 of the TSD, vehicles are 
plotted as data points defined by (footprint, fuel economy) or (footprint, CO2 emissions).  In a 
few instances when relevant vehicle information (such as, for example, vehicle footprint) was 
not available from these two sources, the agencies obtained this information principally from 
publicly-accessible internet sites such as Motortrend.com or Edmunds.com, and occasionally 
from other sources (such as articles about specific vehicles revealed from internet search 
engine research).d,e,f   
The baseline vehicle fleet for the analysis informing these proposed rules is highly 
similar to the baseline vehicle fleet used in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, and like that 
baseline, is comprised of publicly-available data to the largest extent possible.  Whereas some 
of the technology data included in the MYs 2012-2016 analysis’ baseline fleet was based on 
confidential product plan information about MY 2008 vehicles, specifically, data about which 
vehicles already have low friction lubricants, electric power steering, improved accessories,

 A small amount of footprint data from manufacturers’ MY 2008 product plans submitted to the agencies was 
used in the development of the baseline.

and low rolling resistance tires applied, the agencies no longer consider that information as 
needing to be withheld, because by now all MY 2008 vehicle models are already in the on-
road fleet.  As a result, the agencies are able to make public the exact baseline used in this 
rulemaking analysis. 
As explained in the MYs 2012-2016 TSD, creating the 2008 baseline fleet Excel file 
was an extremely labor-intensive process.  EPA in consultation with NHTSA first considered 
using EPA’s CAFE certification data, which contains most of the required information.  
However, since the deadline for manufacturers to report this data did not allow enough time, 
in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, for early modeling review, the agencies began to create 
the baseline fleet file using an alternative data source. 
The agencies ultimately relied on a combination of EPA’s vehicle emissions 
certification data, data from a paid subscription to Ward’s Automotive Group, and CAFE 
certification data.  EPA’s vehicle emissions certification data contains much of the 
information required for creating a baseline fleet file, but it lacked the production volumes 
that are necessary for the OMEGA and Volpe models, and also contains some vehicle models 
that manufacturers certified but did not produce in MY 2008.  The data from Ward’s 
contained production volumes (which were not ultimately used, because they did not have 
volumes for individual vehicles down to the resolution of the specific engine and transmission 
level) and vehicle specifications, and eliminated extraneous vehicles. 
The EPA vehicle emissions certification dataset came in two parts, an engine file and a 
vehicle file, which the agencies combined into one spreadsheet using their common index.  
The more-specific Ward’s data also came in two parts, an engine file and a vehicle file, and 
also required mapping, which was more difficult than combining the EPA vehicle emissions 
certification dataset files because there was no common index between the Ward’s files.  A 
new index was implanted in the engine file and a search equation in the vehicle file, which 
identified most of the vehicle and engine combinations.  Each vehicle and engine combination 
was reviewed and corrections were made manually when the search routine failed to give the 
correct engine and vehicle combination.  The combined Ward’s data was then mapped to the 
EPA vehicle emissions certification data by creating a new index in the combined Ward’s 
data and using the same process that was used to combine the Ward’s engine and vehicle files.   
In the next step, CAFE certification data had to be merged in order to fill out the 
needed production volumes.  NHTSA and EPA reviewed the CAFE certification data for MY 
2008 as it became available in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking.  The CAFE certification set 
could have been used with the Ward’s data without the EPA vehicle emission certification 
data set, but was instead appended to the combined Ward’s and EPA vehicle emission 
certification dataset.  That combined dataset was then mapped into the CAFE dataset using 
the same Excel mapping technique described above.  Finally EPA and NHTSA obtained the 
remaining attribute and technology data, such as footprint, curb weight, and others (for a 
complete list of data with sources see Table 1-1 below) from other sources, thus completing 
the baseline dataset. 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-5 
 
We note that, besides the use of updated AEO and CSM information, the baseline fleet 
for this rulemaking is different from the fleet used in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking in one 
fairly minor way.  Specifically, in the MYs 2012-2016 the agencies aggregated full-size 
pickup data in the baseline by using average values to represent all variants of a given pickup 
line.  While full-size pickups might be offered with various combinations of cab style (e.g., 
regular, extended, crew) and box length (e.g., 5 ½’, 6 ½’, 8’), and therefore multiple footprint 
sizes, CAFE compliance data for MY 2008 did not contain footprint information, and 
therefore could not reliably be used to identify which pickup entries correspond to footprint 
values estimable from public or commercial sources.  Therefore, the agencies used the known 
production levels of average values to represent all variants of a given pickup line (e.g., all 
variants of the F-150, or all variants of the Sierra/Silverado) in order to calculate the sales-
weighted average footprint/fuel economy value for each pickup family.  In retrospect, this 
may have affected how we fit the light truck target curve, among other things, so the agencies 
have since created an expanded version of the fleet to account for the variation in 
footprint/wheelbase for the large pickups of Chrysler, Ford, GM, Nissan and Toyota.  In MY 
2008, large pickups were available from Nissan with 2, Chrysler and Toyota with 3, and Ford 
and GM with 5 wheelbase/footprint combinations.  The agencies got this footprint data from 
MY 2008 product plans submitted by the various manufacturers, which can be made public at 
this time because by now all MY 2008 vehicle models are already in production, which makes 
footprint data about them essentially public information. 
The agencies created the expanded fleet by replicating original records from a single 
pickup footprint model into multiple pickup models with distinct footprint values, in order to 
reflect the additional pickup model footprints just noted.  For example, an F-150 in the MY 
2008 baseline used in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking analysis with a footprint value of 67 
square feet, is disaggregated by replicating 2 times in all respects, except with footprint values 
of 58, 67, and 73 square feet.  Sales volumes of these pickups from the original record were 
distributed to each of the “58 square feet” and “73 square feet” duplicates based on the 
distribution of MY 2008 sales by these pickups’ wheelbase/footprint, which the agencies took 
from product plan data submitted by the manufacturers in 2008/2009 in response to requests 
to support the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking analysis.  The agencies were able to distribute the 
sales for each of the original pickups by wheelbase/footprint by matching each of the pickups 
in the baseline fleet with pickups in the product plans on the basis of drive type, transmission 
type, and engine displacement, cylinders/configuration and HP, and then sorting and summing 
the sales of the matched pickups in the product plans by wheelbase/footprint. 
Both agencies used this fleet forecast to populate input files for the agencies’ 
respective modeling systems.  The structure of the market forecast input file used for DOT’s 
CAFE Compliance and Effects Modeling System (a.k.a. “the Volpe model”) is described the 
model documentation.2  To help readers who wish to directly examine the baseline fleet file 
for EPA’s OMEGA model, and to provide some idea of its contents for those readers who do 
not, Table 1-1 shows the columns of the complete fleet file, which includes the MY 2008 
baseline data that was compiled.  Each column has its name, definition (description) and 
source.  Most elements shown in Table 1-1 also appear in the market forecast input file for

The data in Table 1-2 indicates that manufacturers had already begun implementing a 
number of fuel economy/GHG reduction technologies in the baseline (2008) fleet.  For 
example, VW stands out as having a significant number of turbocharged direct injection 
engines, though it is uncertain whether their engines are also downsized.  Some of the valve 
and cam technologies are quite common in the baseline fleet: for example, nearly half the 
baseline fleet already has dual cam phasing, while Honda and GM have considerable levels of 
engines with cylinder deactivation.  Honda also has already implemented continuously 
variable valve lift on a majority of their engines.  Part of the implication of these technologies 
already being present in the baseline is that if manufacturers have already implemented them, 
they are therefore not available in the rulemaking analysis for improving fuel economy and 
reducing CO2 emissions further, requiring the agencies to look toward increasing penetration 
of these and other technologies and increasingly advanced technologies to project continued 
improvements in stringency over time. 
The section below provides further detail on the conversion of the MY 2008 baseline 
into the MYs 2017-2025 reference fleet.  It also describes more of the data contained in the 
baseline spreadsheet. 
1.3 The MY 2017-2025 Reference Fleet 
The reference fleet aims to reflect the current market conditions and expectations 
about conditions of the vehicle fleet during the model years to which the agencies’ rules 
apply.  Fundamentally, constructing this fleet involved projecting the MY 2008 baseline fleet 
into the MYs 2017-2025 model years.  It also included the assumption that none of the vehicle 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-11 
 
models had changes during this period.  Projecting this future fleet is a process that is 
necessarily uncertain.  NHTSA and EPA therefore relied on many sources of reputable 
information to make these projections.   
1.3.1 On what data is the reference vehicle fleet based? 
EPA and NHTSA have based the projection of total car and light truck sales on the 
most recent projections available made by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).  EIA 
publishes a projection of national energy use annually called the Annual Energy Outlook 
(AEO).3  EIA published its Early Annual Energy Outlook for 2011 in December 2010.  EIA 
released updated data to NHTSA in February (Interim AEO).  The final release of AEO for 
2011 came out in April 2011, but by that time EPA/NHTSA had already prepared modeling 
runs for potential 2017-2025 standards using the interim data release to NHTSA.  EPA and 
NHTSA will use the newest version of AEO available in projecting the reference fleet for the 
final rule.   
Similar to the analyses supporting the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, the agencies have 
used the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s) National Energy Modeling System 
(NEMS) to estimate the future relative market shares of passenger cars and light trucks. 
However, NEMS methodology includes shifting vehicle sales volume, starting after 2007, 
away from fleets with lower fuel economy (the light-truck fleet) towards vehicles with higher 
fuel economies (the passenger car fleet) in order to facilitate compliance with CAFE and 
GHG MYs 2012-2016 standards (the car and truck volumes based on this analysis are shown 
in Table 1-3).  Because we use our market projection as a baseline relative to which we 
measure the effects of new standards, and we attempt to estimate the industry’s ability to 
comply with new standards without changing product mix (i.e., we analyze the effects of the 
proposed rules assuming manufacturers will not change fleet composition as a compliance 
strategy, as opposed to changes that might happen due to market forces), the Interim AEO 
2011-projected shift in passenger car market share as a result of required fuel economy 
improvements creates a circularity.  Therefore, for the current analysis, the agencies 
developed a new projection of passenger car and light truck sales shares by running scenarios 
from the Interim AEO 2011 reference case that first deactivate the above-mentioned sales-
volume shifting methodology and then hold post-2017 CAFE standards constant at MY 2016 
levels.  Incorporating these changes reduced the projected passenger car share of the light 
vehicle market by an average of about 5% during 2017-2025.  This case is referred to as the 
“Unforced Reference Case,” and the values are shown below in Table 1-4.

In 2017, car and light truck sales are projected to be 8.4 and 7.4 million units, 
respectively.  While the total level of sales of 15.8 million units is similar to pre-2008 levels, 
the fraction of car sales in 2017 and beyond is projected to be higher than in the 2000-2007 
time frame.  Note that EIA’s definition of cars and trucks follows that used by NHTSA prior 
to the MY 2011 CAFE final rule.  The MY 2011 CAFE final rule reclassified approximately 1 
million 2-wheel drive sport utility vehicles from the truck fleet to the car fleet.  EIA’s sales 
projections of cars and trucks for the 2017-2025 model years under the old NHTSA truck 
definition are shown above in Table 1-3 and Table 1-4. 
In addition to a shift towards more car sales, sales of segments within both the car and 
truck markets have also been changing and are expected to continue to change in the future.  
Manufacturers are continuing to introduce more crossover models which offer much of the 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet

utility of SUVs but use more car-like designs and unibody structures.  In order to reflect these 
changes in fleet makeup, EPA and NHTSA used a custom long range forecast purchased from 
CSM Worldwide (CSM).  CSM Worldwide (CSM) g is a well-known industry analyst, that 
provided the forecast used by the agencies for the 2012-2016 final rule.  NHTSA and EPA 
decided to use the forecast from CSM for several reasons.  One, CSM uses a ground up 
approach (e.g., looking at the number of plants and capacity for specific engines, 
transmissions, and vehicles) for their forecast, which the agencies believe is a robust 
forecasting approach.  Two, CSM agreed to allow us to publish their high level data, on which 
the forecast is based, in the public domain.  Three, the CSM forecast covered all the 
timeframe of greatest relevance to this analysis (2017-2025 model years).  Four, it provided 
projections of vehicle sales both by manufacturer and by market segment.  And five, it 
utilized market segments similar to those used in the EPA emission certification program and 
fuel economy guide, such that the agencies could include only the vehicle types covered by 
the proposed standards.   
CSM created a forecast that covered model years 2017-2025.  Since the agencies used 
this forecast to generate the reference fleet (i.e., the fleet expected to be sold absent any 
increases in the stringency regulations after the 2016 model year), it is important for the 
forecast to be independent of increases during 2017-2025 in the stringency of CAFE/ GHG 
standards.  However, CSM assumed that CAFE and GHG standards would continue to 
increase in stringency after 2016, although CSM did not use specific future standards as 
quantitative inputs to its model.  In its quantitative analysis, CSM used fuel price, industry 
demand, consumer demand and other economic factors to project the composition of the 
future fleet.  In response to question by the agencies, CSM indicated that their assumption of 
future standards had a negligible (non-discernable) impact on their forecast since it was not a 
direct quantitative input to the model such that CSM’s forecast would have been essentially 
the same had CSM assumed no stringency increases after 2016. 
The agencies combined the CSM forecast with data from other sources to create the 
reference fleet projections.  This process is discussed in sections that follow. 
1.3.2 How do the agencies develop the reference vehicle fleet? 
The process of producing the 2017-2025 reference fleet involved combining the 
baseline fleet with the projection data described above.  This was a complex multistep 
procedure, which is described in this section.   
1.3.3 How was the 2008 baseline data merged with the CSM data? 
EPA and NHTSA employed the same methodology as in the 2012-16 rule for mapping 
certification vehicles to CSM vehicles.  Merging the 2008 baseline data with the 2017-2025

CSM data required a thorough mapping of certification vehicles to CSM vehicles by 
individual make and model.  One challenge that the agencies faced when determining a 
reference case fleet was that the sales data projected by CSM had different market 
segmentation than the data contained in EPA’s internal database.  In order to create a common 
segmentation between the two databases, the agencies performed a side-by-side comparison 
of each vehicle model in both datasets, and created an additional “CSM segment” modifier in 
the spreadsheet to map the two datasets.  The reference fleet sales based on the “CSM 
segmentation” was then projected. 
The baseline data and reference fleet volumes are available to the public.  The baseline Excel 
spreadsheet in the docket is the result of the merged files.4  The spreadsheet provides specific 
details on the sources and definitions for the data.  The Excel file contains several tabs.  They 
are: “Data”, “Data Tech Definitions”, “SUM”, “SUM Tech Definitions”, “Truck Vehicle 
Type Map”, and “Car Vehicle Type Map”.  “Data” is the tab with the raw data.  “Data Tech 
Definitions” is the tab where each column is defined and its data source named.  “SUM” is the 
tab where the raw data is processed to be used in the OMEGA and Volpe models.  The 
“SUM” tab minus columns A-F and minus the Generic vehicles is the input file for the 
models.  The “Generic” manufacturer (shown in the “SUM” tab) is the sum of all 
manufacturers and is calculated as a reference, and for data verification purposes.  It is used to 
validate the manufacturers’ totals.  It also gives an overview of the fleet.    
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet

Table 1-5 shows the sum of the models chosen.  The number of models is determined 
by the number of unique segment and vehicle type combinations.  These combinations of 
segment and vehicle type (the vehicle type number is the same as the technology package 
number) are determined by the technology packages discussed in the EPA RIA.   “SUM Tech 
Definitions” is the tab where the columns of the “SUM” tab are defined.  The “Truck Vehicle 
Type Map” and “Car Vehicle Type Map” map the number of cylinder and valve actuation 
technology to the “tech package” vehicle type number.

In the combined EPA certification and CSM database, all 2008 vehicle models were 
assumed to continue out to 2025, though their volumes changed in proportion to CSM 
projections.  Also, any new models expected to be introduced within the 2009-2025 
timeframe are not included in the data.  These volumes are reassigned to the existing models 
to keep the overall fleet volume the same.  All MYs 2017-2025 vehicles are mapped to the 
existing vehicles by a process of mapping to manufacturer market share and overall segment 
distribution.  The mappings are discussed in the next section.  Further discussion of this 
limitation is discussed below in section 1.3.4.  The statistics of this fleet will be presented 
below since further modifications were required to the volumes as the next section describes.   
1.3.4 How were the CSM forecasts normalized to the AEO forecasts? 
The next step in the agencies’ generation of the reference fleet is one of the more 
complicated steps to explain.  Here, the projected CSM forecasts for relative sales of cars and 
trucks by manufacturer and by market segment was normalized (set equal) to the total sales 
estimates of the Early Release of the 2011 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO).  NHTSA and EPA 
used projected car and truck volumes for this period from Early AEO 2011.  However, the 
AEO projects sales only at the car and truck level, not at the manufacturer and model-specific 
level, and the agencies’ analysis requires this further level of detail.  The CSM data provided 
year-by-year percentages of cars and trucks sold by each manufacturer as well as the 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-17 
 
percentages of each vehicle segment.  Using these percentages normalized to the AEO-
projected volumes then provided the manufacturer-specific market share and model-specific 
sales for model years 2017-2025 (it is worth clarifying that the agencies are not using the 
model-specific sales volumes from CSM, only the higher-level volumes by manufacturer and 
segment).  This process is described in greater detail in the following paragraphs.     
In order to determine future production volumes, the agencies developed multipliers 
by manufacturer and vehicle segment that could be applied to MY 2008 volumes.  The 
process for developing the multipliers is complicated, but is easiest to explain as a three-step 
process, though the first step is combined with both the second and third step, so only one 
multiplier per manufacturer and vehicle segment is developed. 
The three steps are: 
1) Adjust total car and truck sales to match AEO projections. 
2) Adjust car sales to match CSM market share projections for each manufacturer 
and car segment. 
3) Adjust truck sales to match CSM market share projections for each 
manufacturer and truck segment. 
The first step is the adjustment of total car and truck sales in 2008 to match AEO 
projections of total car and truck sales in 2017-2025.  The volumes for all of the trucks in 
2008 were added up (TruckSum2008), and so were the volumes of all the cars (CarSum2008).  
A multiplier was developed to scale the volumes in 2008 to the AEO projections.  The 
example equation below shows the general form of how to calculate a car or truck multiplier.  
The AEO projections are shown above in Table 1-3. 
 
Example Equation : 
TruckMultiplier(Year X) = AEOProjectionforTrucks(Year X) / TruckSum2008 
CarMultiplier(Year X) = AEOProjectionforCars(Year X) / CarSum2008 
Where: Year X is the model year of the multiplier. 
The AEO projection is different for each model year.  Therefore, the multipliers are 
different for each model year.  The multipliers can be applied to each 2008 vehicle as a first 
adjustment, but multipliers based solely on AEO have limited value since those multipliers  
can only give an adjustment that will give the correct total numbers of cars and trucks without 
the correct market share or vehicle mix.  A correction factor based on the CSM data, which 
does contain market share and vehicle segment mix, is therefore necessary, so combining the 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-18 
 
AEO multiplier with CSM multipliers (one per manufacturer, segment, and model year) will 
give the best multipliers. 
There were several steps in developing an adjustment for Cars based on the CSM data.  
CSM provided data on the market share and vehicle segment distribution.  The first step in 
determining the adjustment for Cars was to total the number of Cars in each vehicle segment 
by manufacturer in MY 2008.  A total for all manufacturers in each segment was also 
calculated.  The next step was to multiply the volume of each segment for each manufacturer 
by the CSM market share.  The AEO multiplier was also applied at this time.  This gave 
projected volumes with AEO total volumes and market share correction for Cars.  This is 
shown in the “Adjusted for 2017AEO and Manufacturer Market Share” column of Table 1-6. 
The next step is to adjust the sales volumes for CSM vehicle segment distribution.  
The process for adjusting for vehicle segment is more complicated than a simple one step 
multiplication.  In order to keep manufacturers’ volumes constant and still have the correct 
vehicle segment distribution, vehicles need to move from segment to segment while 
maintaining constant manufacturers’ totals.  Six rules and one assumption were applied to 
accomplish the shift.  The assumption (based on the shift in vehicle sales in 2008 and 2009) is 
that people are moving to smaller vehicles in the rulemaking time frame independently of 
regulatory requirements.  A higher-level (less detailed) example of this procedure is provided 
in Section II of the preamble.   
Vehicles from CSM’s “Luxury Car,” “Specialty Car,” and “Other Car” segments, if 
reduced, will be equally distributed to the remaining four categories (“Full-Size Car,” “Mid-
Size Car,” “Small Car,” “Mini Car”).  If these sales increased, they were taken from the 
remaining four categories so that the relative sales in these four categories remained constant. 
Vehicles from CSM’s “Luxury Car,” “Specialty Car,” and “Other Car” segments, if 
increased will take equally from the remaining categories (“Full-Size Car,” “Mid-Size Car,” 
“Small Car,” “Mini Car”). 
All manufacturers have the same multiplier for a given segment shift based on moving 
all vehicles in that segment to achieve the CSM distribution.  Table 1-6 shows how the 2017 
vehicles moved and the multipliers that were created for each adjustment.  This does not mean 
that new vehicle segments will be added (except for Generic Mini Car described in the next 
step) to manufacturers that do not produce them.  Vehicles within each manufacturer will be 
shifted as close to the distribution as possible given the other rules.  Table 1-7 has the 
percentages of Cars per CSM segment.  These percentages are multiplied by the total number 
of vehicles in a given year to get the total sales in the segment.  Table 1-6 shows the totals for 
2017 in the “2017 AEO-CSM Sales Goal” column. 
When “Full-Size Car,” “Mid-Size Car,” “Small Car” are processed, if vehicles need to 
move in or out of the segment, they will move into or out of the next smaller segment.  So, if 
Mid-Size Cars are being processed they can only move to or be taken from Small Cars.  Note:  
In order to accomplish this, a “Generic Mini Car” segment was added to manufacturers who 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-19 
 
did not have a Mini (type) Car in production in 2008, but needed to shift down vehicles from 
the Small Car segment. 
The data must be processed in the following order: “Luxury Car,” “Specialty Car,” 
“Other Car,” “Full-Size Car,” “Mid-Size Car,” “Small Car.”  The “Mini Car” does not need to 
be processed separately.  By using this order, it works out that vehicles will always move 
toward the correct distribution.  There are two exceptions, BMW and Porsche only have 
“Luxury Car,” “Specialty Car,” and “Other Car” vehicles, so their volumes were not changed 
or shifted since these rules did not apply to them. 
When an individual manufacturer multiplier is applied for a segment, the vehicles 
move to or from the appropriate segments as specified in the previous rules and as shown in 
Table 1-6.

Mathematically, an individual manufacturer multiplier is calculated by making the 
segment the goal and dividing by the previous total for the segment (shown in Table 1-7).  If 
the number is greater than 1, the vehicles are entering the segment, and if the number is less 
than 1, the vehicles are leaving the segment.  So, for example, if Luxury Cars have an 
adjustment of 1.5, then for a specific manufacturer who has Luxury Cars, a multiplier of 1.5 is 
applied to its luxury car volume, and the total number of vehicles that shifted into the Luxury 
segment is subtracted from the remaining segments to maintain that company’s market share.  
On the other hand, if Large Cars have an adjustment of 0.7, then for a specific manufacturer 
who has Large Cars, a multiplier of 0.7 is applied to its Large Cars, and the total number of 
vehicles leaving that segment is transferred into that manufacturer’s Mid-Size Cars.  
After the vehicle volumes are shifted using the above rules, a total for each 
manufacturer and vehicle segment is maintained.  The total for each manufacturer segment for 
a specific model year (e.g., 2017 General Motors Luxury Cars) divided by the MY 2008 total 
for that manufacturer segment (e.g., 2008 General Motors Luxury Cars) is the new multiplier 
used to determine the future vehicle volume for each vehicle model.  This is done by taking 
the multiplier (which is for a specific manufacturer and segment) times the MY 2008 volume 
for the specific vehicle model (e.g., 2008 General Motors Luxury Car Cadillac CTS).  This 
process is repeated for each model year (2017-2025).   
The method used to adjust CSM Trucks to the AEO market share was different than 
the method used for Cars.  The process for Cars is different than Trucks because it is not 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-21 
 
possible to predict how vehicles would shift between segments based on current market 
trends.   This is because of the added utility of some trucks that makes their sales more 
insensitive to factors like fuel price.  Again, CSM provided data on the market share and 
vehicle segment distribution.  The process for having the fleet match CSM’s market share and 
vehicle segment distribution was iterative. 
The following totals were determined: 
• The total number of trucks for each manufacturer in 2008 model year. 
• The total number of trucks in each truck segment in 2008 model year. 
• The total number of truck in each segment for each manufacturer in 2008 model 
year. 
• The total number of trucks for each manufacturer in a specific future model year 
based on the AEO and CSM data.  This is the goal for market share. 
• The total number of trucks in each truck segment in a specific future model year 
based on the AEO and CSM data.  This is the goal for vehicle segment 
distribution.  Table 1-8 has the percentages of Trucks per CSM segment.

To start, two different types of tables were created.  One table had each manufacturer 
with its total sales for 2008 (similar to Table 1-10).  This table will have the goal for each 
The Baseline and Reference Vehicle Fleet 
1-22 
 
manufacturer, and a column added for each iteration with the current total.  The second table 
has a truck segment total by manufacturer.  The second table starts out with a “Generic” 
manufacturer (Table 1-10) which is the table where the goal resides.  Each manufacturer 
(BMW for example is shown in Table 1-11) is then listed below the “Generic” manufacturer.  
With each iteration, a new total is added for each segment that is calculated and added to the 
table.  This is not shown in the tables below.  The agencies then engaged in a process of first 
adjusting the numbers in the tables to the goal for market share distribution.  This was 
followed by adjusting to the goal for vehicle segment distribution.  Each time an adjustment 
was done a new column was added.  An adjustment was done by creating a multiplier (either 
segment distribution-based or manufacturer distribution-based) and applying it to each vehicle 
segment total in the current iteration.  A manufacturer-based multiplier is calculated by taking 
the goal total for a manufacturer and dividing by the current total (starting with 2008 model 
year volumes) for a manufacturer.  A segment distribution-based multiplier is calculated by 
taking the goal distribution volumes in the Generic manufacturer set and dividing them by the 
current volume.  Table 1-9, Table 1-10, and Table 1-11 below illustrates two iterations using 
BMW as an example.

Using this process, the numbers will get closer to the goal of matching CSM’s market 
share for each manufacturer and distribution for each vehicle segment after each of the 
iterations.  The iterative process is carried out until the totals nearly match the goals. 
After 19 iterations, all numbers were within 0.01% of CSM’s distributions.  The 
calculation iterations could have been stopped sooner, but they were continued to observe 
how the numbers would converge. 
After the market share and segment distribution were complete, the totals need to be 
used to create multipliers that could be applied to the original individual 2008 model year 
vehicle volumes (each unique manufacture models volume).  The total for each manufacturer

segment divided by the 2008 model year total for each manufacturer segment gives a 
multiplier that can be applied to each vehicle based on its manufacturer and segment. 
The above process is done for each model year needed (2017-2025).  The multipliers 
are then applied to each vehicle in 2008 model year, which gives a volume for each vehicle in 
2017 through 2025 model year.

Table 1-18 also shows how the change in fleet make-up may affect the footprint 
distributions over time.  The resulting data indicate that footprint will not change significantly 
between 2008 and 2025.  There will be an increase in the number of cars sold, which will 
cause the average footprints for cars and trucks combined to be slightly smaller (about 2%).  
This is the result of AEO projecting an increased number of cars, and CSM predicting that 
most of that increase will be in the subcompact segment.  Again, we note that in order to 
ensure that our baseline inputs were not influenced by the proposed regulations, agencies re-
ran AEO to hold standards constant after 2016 (the reader will remember from the text above 
that CSM had indicated that its projections were not sensitive to assumptions about new 
standards).

Table 1-19 below shows the changes in engine cylinders over the model years.  The 
current assumptions show that engines will be downsized over the model years to which these 
proposed rules apply.  This shift is a projected consequence of the expected changes in class 
and segment mix as predicted by AEO and CSM, and does not represent engine downsizing 
attributable to the 2012-2016 light-duty CAFE and GHG standards.

For the final rule, the agencies intend to use a more recent version of EIAs AEO, and we also 
will consider using MY 2010 for the baseline, and potentially an updated future market 
forecast.

Chapter 2:  What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are 
Proposing, and How Were They Developed?  
2.1 Why are standards attribute-based and defined by a mathematical function?  
As in the MYs 2012-2016 CAFE/GHG rules, and as NHTSA did in the MY 2011 
CAFE rule, NHTSA and EPA are proposing to set attribute-based CAFE and CO2 standards 
that are defined by a mathematical function. EPCA, as amended by EISA, expressly requires 
that CAFE standards for passenger cars and light trucks be based on one or more vehicle 
attributes related to fuel economy, and be expressed in the form of a mathematical function.1  
The CAA has no such requirement, although such an approach is permissible under section 
202 (a) and EPA has used the attribute-based approach in issuing standards under analogous 
provisions of the CAA (e.g., criteria pollutant standards for non-road diesel engines using 
engine size as the attribute,2 in the recent GHG standards for heavy duty pickups and vans 
using a work factor attribute,3 and in the MYs 2012-2016 GHG rule itself which used vehicle 
footprint as the attribute).  Public comments on the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking widely 
supported attribute-based standards for both agencies’ standards. 
Under an attribute-based standard, every vehicle model has a performance target (fuel 
economy and CO2 emissions for CAFE and CO2 emissions standards, respectively), the level 
of which depends on the vehicle’s attribute (for this proposal, footprint, as discussed below).  
The manufacturers’ fleet average performance is determined by the production-weighteda 
average (for CAFE, harmonic average) of those targets. 
The agencies believe that an attribute-based standard is preferable to a single-industry-
wide average standard in the context of CAFE and CO2 standards for several reasons.  First, if 
the shape is chosen properly, every manufacturer is more likely to be required to continue 
adding more fuel efficient technology each year across their fleet, because the stringency of 
the compliance obligation will depend on the particular product mix of each manufacturer.  
Therefore a maximum feasible attribute-based standard will tend to require greater fuel 
savings and CO2 emissions reductions overall than would a maximum feasible flat standard 
(that is, a single mpg or CO2 level applicable to every manufacturer). 
 Second, depending on the attribute, attribute-based standards reduce the incentive for 
manufacturers to respond to CAFE and CO2 standards in ways harmful to safety.

 The 2002 NAS Report described at length and quantified the potential safety problem with average fuel 
economy standards that specify a single numerical requirement for the entire industry.  See 2002 NAS Report at 
5, finding 12.  Ensuing analyses, including by NHTSA, support the fundamental conclusion that standards 
structured to minimize incentives to downsize all but the largest vehicles will tend to produce better safety 
outcomes than flat standards. 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing

based standards provide little, if any, incentive to build smaller vehicles simply to meet a 
fleet-wide average, because the smaller vehicles will be subject to more stringent compliance 
targets.c 
Third, attribute-based standards provide a more equitable regulatory framework for 
different vehicle manufacturers.d  A single industry-wide average standard imposes 
disproportionate cost burdens and compliance difficulties on the manufacturers that need to 
change their product plans to meet the standards, and puts no obligation on those 
manufacturers that have no need to change their plans. As discussed above, attribute-based 
standards help to spread the regulatory cost burden for fuel economy more broadly across all 
of the vehicle manufacturers within the industry. 
Fourth, attribute-based standards better respect economic conditions and consumer 
choice, as compared to single-value standards.  A flat, or single value standard, encourages a 
certain vehicle size fleet mix by creating incentives for manufacturers to use vehicle 
downsizing as a compliance strategy.  Under a footprint-based standard, manufacturers are 
required to invest in technologies that improve the fuel economy of the vehicles they sell 
rather than shifting the product mix, because reducing the size of the vehicle is generally a 
less viable compliance strategy given that smaller vehicles have more stringent regulatory 
targets.   
 
2.2 What attribute are the agencies proposing to use, and why? 
As in the MYs 2012-2016 CAFE/GHG rules,  and as NHTSA did in the MY 2011 
CAFE rule, NHTSA and EPA are proposing to set CAFE and CO2 standards that are based on 
vehicle footprint, which has an observable correlation to fuel economy and emissions.  There 
are several policy and technical reasons why NHTSA and EPA believe that footprint is the 
most appropriate attribute on which to base the standards, even though some other vehicle 
attributes (notably curb weight) are better correlated to fuel economy and emissions. 
First, in the agencies’ judgment, from the standpoint of vehicle safety, it is important 
that the CAFE and CO2 standards be set in a way that does not encourage manufacturers to 
respond by selling vehicles that are in any way less safe.  While NHTSA’s research of 
historical crash data also indicates that reductions in vehicle mass that are accompanied by 
reductions in vehicle footprint tend to compromise vehicle safety, footprint-based standards 
provide an incentive to use advanced lightweight materials and structures that would be 
discouraged by weight-based standards, because manufacturers can use them to improve a 
vehicle’s fuel economy and CO2 emissions without their use necessarily resulting in a change 
in the vehicle’s fuel economy and emissions targets.

Further, although we recognize that weight is better correlated with fuel economy and 
CO2 emissions than is footprint, we continue to believe that there is less risk of “gaming” 
(changing the attribute(s) to achieve a more favorable target)  by increasing footprint under 
footprint-based standards than by increasing vehicle mass under weight-based standards—it is 
relatively easy for a manufacturer to add enough weight to a vehicle to decrease its applicable 
fuel economy target a significant amount, as compared to increasing vehicle footprint.  We 
also continue to agree with concerns raised in 2008 by some commenters on the MY 2011 
CAFE rulemaking that there would be greater potential for gaming under multi-attribute 
standards, such as those that also depend on weight, torque, power, towing capability, and/or 
off-road capability.  The agencies agree with the assessment first presented in NHTSA’s MY 
2011 CAFE final rule4 that the possibility of gaming is lowest with footprint-based standards, 
as opposed to weight-based or multi-attribute-based standards.  Specifically, standards that 
incorporate weight, torque, power, towing capability, and/or off-road capability in addition to 
footprint would not only be more complex, but by providing degrees of freedom with respect 
to more easily-adjusted attributes, they could make it less certain that the future fleet would 
actually achieve the average fuel economy and CO2 reduction levels projected by the 
agencies.  
The agencies recognize that based on economic and consumer demand factors that are 
external to this rule, the distribution of footprints in the future may be different (either smaller 
or larger) than what is projected in this rule.  However, the agencies continue to believe that 
there will not be significant shifts in this distribution as a direct consequence of this proposed 
rule.  The agencies also recognize that some international attribute-based standards use 
attributes other than footprint and that there could be benefits for a number of manufacturers 
if there was greater international harmonization of fuel economy and GHG standards for light-
duty vehicles, but this is largely a question of how stringent standards are and how they are 
tested and enforced.  It is entirely possible that footprint-based and weight-based systems can 
coexist internationally and not present an undue burden for manufacturers if they are carefully 
crafted.  Different countries or regions may find different attributes appropriate for basing 
standards, depending on the particular challenges they face—from fuel prices, to family size 
and land use, to safety concerns, to fleet composition and consumer preference, to other 
environmental challenges besides climate change.  The agencies anticipate working more 
closely with other countries and regions in the future to consider how to address these issues 
in a way that least burdens manufacturers while respecting each country’s need to meet its 
own particular challenges. 
The agencies continue to find that footprint is the most appropriate attribute upon 
which to base the proposed standards, but recognizing strong public interest in this issue, we 
seek comment on whether the agencies should consider setting standards for the final rule 
based on another attribute or another combination of attributes.  If commenters suggest that 
the agencies should consider another attribute or another combination of attributes, the 
agencies specifically request that the commenters address the concerns raised in the 
paragraphs above regarding the use of other attributes, and explain how standards should be 
developed using the other attribute(s) in a way that contributes more to fuel savings and CO2 
reductions than the footprint-based standards, without compromising safety.

2.3 What mathematical functions have the agencies previously used, and why? 
2.3.1 NHTSA in MY 2008 and MY 2011 CAFE (constrained logistic) 
For the MY 2011 CAFE rule, NHTSA estimated fuel economy levels after 
normalization for differences in technology, but did not make adjustments to reflect other 
vehicle attributes (e.g., power-to-weight ratios).e  Starting with the technology adjusted 
passenger car and light truck fleets, NHTSA used minimum absolute deviation (MAD) 
regression without sales weighting to fit a logistic form as a starting point to develop 
mathematical functions defining the standards.  NHTSA then identified footprints at which to 
apply minimum and maximum values (rather than letting the standards extend without limit) 
and transposed these functions vertically (i.e., on a gpm basis, uniformly downward) to 
produce the promulgated standards.  In the preceding rule, for MYs 2008-2011 light truck 
standards, NHTSA examined a range of potential functional forms, and concluded that, 
compared to other considered forms, the constrained logistic form provided the expected and 
appropriate trend (decreasing fuel economy as footprint increases), but avoided creating 
“kinks” the agency was concerned would provide distortionary incentives for vehicles with 
neighboring footprints.f 
2.3.2 MYs 2012-2016 Light Duty GHG/CAFE (constrained/piecewise linear) 
For the MYs 2012-2016 rules, NHTSA and EPA re-evaluated potential methods for 
specifying mathematical functions to define fuel economy and GHG standards.  The agencies 
concluded that the constrained logistic form, if applied to post-MY 2011 standards, would 
likely contain a steep mid-section that would provide undue incentive to increase the footprint 
of midsize passenger cars.5  The agencies judged that a range of methods to fit the curves 
would be reasonable, and used a minimum absolute deviation (MAD) regression without sales 
weighting on a technology-adjusted car and light truck fleet to fit a linear equation.  This 
equation was used as a starting point to develop mathematical functions defining the standards 
as discussed above.  The agencies then identified footprints at which to apply minimum and 
maximum values (rather than letting the standards extend without limit) and transposed these 
constrained/piecewise linear functions vertically (i.e., on a gpm or CO2 basis, uniformly 
downward) to produce the fleetwide fuel economy and CO2 emission levels for cars and light 
trucks described in the final rule.6

a small change in footprint results in a disproportionally large change in stringency.

2.3.3 How have the agencies changed the mathematical functions for the 
proposed MYs 2017-2025 standards, and why? 
By requiring NHTSA to set CAFE standards that are attribute-based and defined by a 
mathematical function, Congress appears to have wanted the post-EISA standards to be data-
driven – a mathematical function defining the standards, in order to be “attribute-based,” 
should reflect the observed relationship in the data between the attribute chosen and fuel 
economy.g   EPA is also proposing to set attribute-based CO2 standards defined by similar 
mathematical functions, for the reasonable technical and policy grounds discussed below and 
in section II of the preamble to the proposed rule, and which supports a harmonization with 
the CAFE standards.  
The relationship between fuel economy (and GHG emissions) and footprint, though 
directionally clear (i.e., fuel economy tends to decrease and CO2 emissions tend to increase 
with increasing footprint), is theoretically vague and quantitatively uncertain; in other words, 
not so precise as to a priori yield only a single possible curve.h  There is thus a range of 
legitimate options open to the agencies in developing curve shapes.  The agencies may of 
course consider statutory objectives in choosing among the many reasonable alternatives.  For 
example, curve shapes that might have some theoretical basis could lead to perverse outcomes 
contrary to the intent of the statutes to conserve energy and protect human health and the 
environment.i  Thus, the decision of how to set the target curves cannot always be just about 
most “clearly” using a mathematical function to define the relationship between fuel economy 
and the attribute; it often has to have a normative aspect, where the agencies adjust the 
function that would define the relationship in order to avoid perverse results, improve equity 
of burden across manufacturers, preserve consumer choice, etc.  This is true both for the 
decisions that guide the mathematical function defining the sloped portion of the target 
curves, and for the separate decisions that guide the agencies’ choice of “cutpoints” (if any) 
that define the fuel economy/CO2 levels and footprints at each end of the curves where the 
curves become flat.  Data informs these decisions, but how the agencies define and interpret 
the relevant data, and then the choice of methodology for fitting a curve to the data, must 
include a consideration of both technical data and policy goals. 
                                                 
g
  A mathematical function can be defined, of course, that has nothing to do with the relationship between fuel 
economy and the chosen attribute – the most basic example is an industry-wide standard defined as the 
mathematical function average required fuel economy  = X, where X is the single mpg level set by the agency.  
Yet a standard that is simply defined as a mathematical function that is not tied to the attribute(s) would not meet 
the requirement of EISA.  
h
 In fact, numerous manufacturers have confidentially shared with the agencies what they describe as “physics 
based” curves, with each OEM showing significantly different shapes, and footprint relationships.  The sheer 
variety of curves shown to the agencies further confirm the lack of an underlying principle of “fundamental 
physics” driving the relationship between CO2 emission or fuel consumption and footprint, and the lack of an 
underlying principle to dictate any outcome of the agencies’ establishment of footprint-based standards. 
i
 For example, if the agencies set weight-based standards defined by a steep function, the standards might 
encourage manufacturers to keep adding weight to their vehicles to obtain less stringent targets.     
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-6 
 
The next sections examine the policy concerns that the agencies considered in 
developing the proposed target curves that define the proposed MYs 2017-2025 CAFE and 
CO2 standards, new technical work (expanding on similar analyses performed by NHTSA 
when the agency proposed MY 2011-2015 standards, and by both agencies during 
consideration of options for MY 2012-2016 CAFE and GHG standards) that was completed in 
the process of reexamining potential mathematical functions, how the agencies have defined 
the data, and how the agencies explored statistical curve-fitting methodologies in order to 
arrive at proposed curves.  
2.4 What are the agencies proposing for the MYs 2017-2025 curves? 
The proposed mathematical functions for the proposed MYs 2017-2025 standards are 
somewhat changed from the functions for the MYs 2012-2016 standards, in response to 
comments received from stakeholders and in order to address technical concerns and policy 
goals that the agencies judge more significant in this 9-year rulemaking than in the prior one, 
which only included 5 years.  This section (2.4) discusses the methodology the agencies 
selected as, at this time, best addressing those technical concerns and policy goals, given the 
various technical inputs to the agencies’ current analyses.  Section 2.5 discusses how the 
agencies determined the cutpoints and the flat portions of the MYs 2017-2025 target curves.  
We also note that both of these sections address only how the target curves were fit to fuel 
consumption and CO2 emission values determined using the city and highway test procedures, 
and that in determining respective regulatory alternatives, the agencies made further 
adjustments to the resultant curves in order to account for adjustments for improvements to 
mobile air conditioners.   
Thus, recognizing that there are many reasonable statistical methods for fitting curves 
to data points that define vehicles in terms of footprint and fuel economy, the agencies have 
chosen for this proposed rule to fit curves using an ordinary least-squares formulation, on 
sales-weighted data, using a fleet that has had technology applied, and after adjusting the data 
for the effects of weight-to-footprint, as described below.  This represents a departure from 
the statistical approach for fitting the curves in MYs 2012-2016, as explained in the next 
section.  The agencies considered a wide variety of reasonable statistical methods in order to 
better understand the range of uncertainty regarding the relationship between fuel 
consumption (the inverse of fuel economy), CO2 emission rates, and footprint, thereby 
providing a range within which decisions about standards would be potentially supportable. 
2.4.1 What concerns were the agencies looking to address that led them to 
change from the approach used for the MYs 2012-2016 curves? 
During the year and a half since the MYs 2012-2016 final rule was issued, NHTSA 
and EPA have received a number of comments from stakeholders on how curves should be 
fitted to the passenger car and light truck fleets.  Some limited-line manufacturers have argued 
that curves should generally be flatter in order to avoid discouraging small vehicles, because 
steeper curves tend to result in more stringent targets for smaller vehicles.  Most full-line 
manufacturers have argued that a passenger car curve similar in slope to the MY 2016 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-7 
 
passenger car curve would be appropriate for future model years, but that the light truck curve 
should be revised to be less difficult for manufacturers selling the largest full-size pickup 
trucks.  These manufacturers argued that the MY 2016 light truck curve was not “physics-
based,” and that in order for future tightening of standards to be feasible for full-line 
manufacturers, the truck curve for later model years should be steeper and extended further 
(i.e., made less stringent) into the larger footprints.  The agencies also do not agree that the 
MY 2016 light truck curve was somehow deficient in lacking a “physics basis,” or that it was 
somehow overly stringent for manufacturers selling large pickups—manufacturers making 
these arguments presented no “physics-based” model to explain how fuel economy should 
depend on footprint.j  The same manufacturers indicated that they believed that the light truck 
standard should be somewhat steeper after MY 2016, primarily because, after more than ten 
years of progressive increases in the stringency of applicable CAFE standards, large pickups 
would be less capable of achieving further improvements without compromising load carrying 
and towing capacity. 
In developing the curve shapes for this proposed rule, the agencies were aware of the 
current and prior technical concerns raised by OEMs concerning the effects of the stringency 
on individual manufacturers and their ability to meet the standards with available 
technologies, while producing vehicles at a cost that allowed them to recover the additional 
costs of the technologies being applied.  Although we continue to believe that the 
methodology for fitting curves for the MY2012-2016 standards was technically sound, we 
recognize manufacturers’ technical concerns regarding their abilities to comply with a 
similarly shallow curve after MY2016 given the anticipated mix of light trucks in MYs 2017-
2025.  As in the MYs 2012-2016 rules, the agencies considered these concerns in the analysis 
of potential curve shapes.  The agencies also considered safety concerns which could be 
raised by curve shapes creating an incentive for vehicle downsizing, as well as the potential 
loss to consumer welfare should vehicle upsizing be unduly disincentivized.  In addition, the 
agencies sought to improve the balance of compliance burdens among manufacturers.  Among 
the technical concerns and resultant policy trade-offs the agencies considered were the 
following: 
 
• Flatter standards (i.e., curves) increase the risk that both the weight and size of 
vehicles will be reduced, compromising highway safety. 
• Flatter standards potentially impact the utility of vehicles by providing an incentive for 
vehicle downsizing. 
• Steeper footprint-based standards may incentivize vehicle upsizing, thus increasing the 
risk that fuel economy and greenhouse gas reduction benefits will be less than 
expected. 
• Given the same industry-wide average required fuel economy or CO2 standard, flatter 
standards tend to place greater compliance burdens on full-line manufacturers  
                                                 
j
 See footnote h. 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-8 
 
• Given the same industry-wide average required fuel economy or CO2 standard, steeper 
standards tend to place greater compliance burdens on limited-line manufacturers 
(depending of course, on which vehicles are being produced). 
• If cutpoints are adopted, given the same industry-wide average required fuel economy, 
moving small-vehicle cutpoints to the left (i.e., up in terms of fuel economy, down in 
terms of CO2 emissions) discourages the introduction of small vehicles, and reduces 
the incentive to downsize small vehicles in ways that would compromise highway 
safety. 
• If cutpoints are adopted, given the same industry-wide average required fuel economy, 
moving large-vehicle cutpoints to the right (i.e., down in terms of fuel economy, up in 
terms of CO2 emissions) better accommodates the unique design requirements of 
larger vehicles—especially large pickups—and extends the size range over which 
downsizing is discouraged. 
All of these were policy goals that required trade-offs, and in determining the curves 
they also required balance against the comments from the OEM comments discussed in the 
introduction to this section.  Ultimately, the agencies do not agree that the MY 2017 target 
curves for this proposal, on a relative basis, should be made significantly flatter than the MY 
2016 curve,k as we believe that this would undo some of the safety-related incentives and 
balancing of compliance burdens among manufacturers—effects that attribute-based 
standards are intended to provide.  
 Nonetheless, the agencies recognize full-line OEM concerns and have tentatively 
concluded that further increases in the stringency of the light truck standards will be more 
feasible if the light truck curve is made steeper than the MY 2016 truck curve and the right 
(large footprint) cut-point is extended over time to larger footprints.  This conclusion is 
supported by the agencies’ technical analyses of regulatory alternatives defined using the 
curves developed in the manner described below. 
2.4.2 What methodologies and data did the agencies consider in developing the 
2017-2025 curves? 
In considering how to address the various policy concerns discussed in the previous 
sections, the agencies revisited the data and performed a number of analyses using different 
combinations of the various statistical methods, weighting schemes, adjustments to the data 
and the addition of technologies to make the fleets less technologically heterogeneous.  As 
discussed in 2.3.3, in the agencies’ judgment, there is no single “correct” way to estimate the 
relationship between CO2 or fuel consumption and footprint – rather, each statistical result is 
based on the underlying assumptions about the particular functional form, weightings and 
error structures embodied in the representational approach.  These assumptions are the subject

 While “significantly” flatter is subjective, the year over year change in curve shapes is discussed in greater

of the following discussion.  This process of performing many analyses using combinations of 
statistical methods generates many possible outcomes, each embodying different potentially 
reasonable combinations of assumptions and each thus reflective of the data as viewed 
through a particular lens.  The choice of a standard developed by a given combination of these 
statistical methods is consequently a decision based upon the agencies’ determination of how, 
given the policy objectives for this rulemaking and the agencies’ MY 2008-based forecast of 
the market through MY 2025, to appropriately reflect the current understanding of the 
evolution of automotive technology and costs, the future prospects for the vehicle market, and 
thereby establish curves (i.e., standards) for cars and light trucks.   
2.4.2.1 What information did the agencies use to estimate a relationship between 
fuel economy, CO2 and footprint? 
For each fleet, the agencies began with the MY 2008-based market forecast developed 
to support this proposal (i.e., the baseline fleet), with vehicles’ fuel economy levels and 
technological characteristics at MY 2008 levels.l  The development, scope, and content of this 
market forecast is discussed in detail in Chapter 1 of the joint Technical Support Document 
supporting this rulemaking. 
Figure 2-1 shows the MY 2008 CO2 by car and truck class as it exists in the EPA 
OMEGA and NHTSA CAFE model data files (for a gasoline-only fleet, fuel consumption—
the inverse of fuel economy—is directly proportional to CO2).  This dataset is the base fleet 
which is the starting point for all analysis in this proposal.

2.4.2.1 What adjustments did the agencies evaluate? 
The agencies believe one possible approach is to fit curves to the minimally adjusted data 
shown above (the approach still includes sales mix adjustments, which influence results of 
sales-weighted regressions), much as DOT did when it first began evaluating potential 
attribute-based standards in 2003.7  However, the agencies have found, as in prior 
rulemakings, that the data are so widely spread (i.e., when graphed, they fall in a loose 
“cloud” rather than tightly around an obvious line) that they indicate a relationship between 
footprint and CO2 and fuel consumption that is real but not particularly strong (Figure 2-1).  
Therefore, as discussed below, the agencies also explored possible adjustments that could 
help to explain and/or reduce the ambiguity of this relationship, or could help to produce 
policy outcomes the agencies judged to be more desirable. 
2.4.2.1.1 Adjustment to reflect differences in technology 
As in prior rulemakings, the agencies consider technology differences between vehicle 
models to be a significant factor producing uncertainty regarding the relationship between 
CO2/fuel consumption and footprint.  Noting that attribute-based standards are intended to 
encourage the application of additional technology to improve fuel efficiency and reduce CO2 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing

emissions, the agencies, in addition to considering approaches based on the unadjusted 
engineering characteristics of MY 2008 vehicle models, therefore also considered approaches 
in which, as for previous rulemakings, technology is added to vehicles for purposes of the 
curve fitting analysis in order to produce fleets that are less varied in technology content. 
The agencies adjusted the baseline fleet for technology by adding all technologies 
considered, except for the most advanced high-BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) 
gasoline engines, diesel engines, strong HEVs, PHEVs, EVs, and FCVs.  The agencies 
included 15 percent mass reduction on all vehicles.  Figure 2-2 shows the same fleet, with 
technology adjustment and 2021 sales applied, and the baseline diesel fueled vehicles, HEV 
and EVs removed from the fleet.  Of note, the fleet is now more closely clusteredm (and lower 
in emissions), but the same basic pattern emerges; in both figures, the CO2 emission rate 
(which, as mentioned above, is directly proportional to fuel consumption for a gasoline-only 
fleet) increases with increasing footprint, although the relationship is less pronounced for 
larger light trucks.

2.4.2.2 Adjustments reflecting differences in performance and “density” 
As discussed in Section 2.4.1, during stakeholder meetings the agencies held while 
developing this NPRM, some manufacturers indicated that they believed that the light truck 
standard should be somewhat steeper after MY 2016.  As a means to produce a steeper light 
truck curve, the agencies considered adjustments for other differences between vehicle 
models (i.e., inflating or deflating the fuel economy of each vehicle model based on the extent 
to which one of the vehicle’s attributes, such as power, is higher or lower than average).  
Previously, NHTSA had rejected such adjustments because they imply that a multi-attribute 
standard may be necessary, and the agencies judged multi-attribute standard to be more 
subject to gaming than a footprint-only standard.n,8  Having considered this issue again for 
purposes of this rulemaking, NHTSA and EPA conclude the need to accommodate in the 
target curves the challenges faced by manufacturers of large pickups currently outweighs 
these prior concerns.  Therefore, the agencies also evaluated curve fitting approaches through 
which fuel consumption and CO2 levels were adjusted with respect to weight-to-footprint 
alone, and in combination with power-to-weight.  While the agencies examined these 
adjustments for purposes of fitting curves, the agencies are not proposing a multi-attribute 
standard; the proposed fuel economy and CO2 targets for each vehicle are still functions of 
footprint alone.  No adjustment would be used in the compliance process. 
The agencies also examined some differences between the technology-adjusted car 
and truck fleets in order to better understand the relationship between footprint and CO2/fuel 
consumption in the agencies’ MY 2008 based forecast.  More direct measures (such as 
coefficients of drag and rolling resistance), while useful for vehicle simulation, were not 
practical or readily available at the fleet level.  Given this issue, and based on analysis 
published in the 2012-2016 rule,9  the agencies investigated a sales-weighted (i.e., treating 
every vehicle unit sold as a separate observation) regression equation involving power to 
weight ratio and vehicle weight (Equation 2-1).o  This equation provides for a strong 
                                                 
n
 For example, in comments on NHTSA’s 2008 NPRM regarding MY 2011-2015 CAFE standards, Porsche 
recommended that standards be defined in terms of a “Summed Weighted Attribute”, wherein the fuel economy 
target would calculated as follows:  target = f(SWA), where target is the fuel economy target applicable to a 
given vehicle model and SWA = footprint + torque1/1.5 + weight1/2.5.  (NHTSA-2008-0089-0174).  While the 
standards the agencies are proposing for MY 2017-2025 are not multi-attribute standards, that is the target is 
only a function of footprint, we are proposing curve shapes that were developed considering more than one 
attribute. 
o
 These parameters directly relate to the amount of energy required to move the vehicle.  As compared to a 
lighter vehicle, more energy is required to move a heavier vehicle the same distance.  Similarly, a more powerful 
engine, when technology adjusted, is less efficient than a less powerful engine.

*In this gasoline only fleet, these coefficients can be divided by 8887 (the amount of 
CO2 produced by the combustion of a gallon of the fuel used to certify the fuel 
economy and emissions of gasoline vehicles) to yield the corresponding fuel 
consumption coefficients. 
 
The coefficients above show, for the agencies’ MY 2008-based market forecast, strong 
correlation between these vehicle attributes and the fuel consumption and emissions of the 
vehicle, as well as strong similarity between car and truck coefficients. Given these very 
similar parameters, similar distributions of power and weight would be expected to produce 
similarly arrayed plots of CO2 (or equivalently, fuel consumption) by footprint, regardless of 
car or truck class.  Based on the differences seen in the technology-adjusted plot (Figure 2-2), 
the agencies further investigated these particular attributes and their relationship to footprint 
in the agencies’ MY 2008-based market forecast, to examine the differences across the 
footprint distribution.   Figure 2-3 shows vehicle curb weight charted against footprint, with 
sales weighted ordinary least squares sales fit (blue) and sales-weighted LOESS fit (red)

 As R2 does not equal 1, there are remaining unaccounted for differences beyond technology, power and weight.

imposed.  For cars, the LOESS fit, which weights nearby points more heavily, q is nearly 
identical to the linear fit in the data filled region between about 40 and 56 sq ft (with the gray 
bar showing standard error on the Loess fit).  For this market forecast, average car curb 
weight is linearly proportional to car footprint between 40 and 56 sq ft, or in other words, cars 
progress in weight in a regular fashion as they get larger (Figure 2-3).  By contrast, a linear fit 
does not overlap with the LOESS fit on the truck side, which indicates that for this market 
forecast, truck curb weight does not linearly increase with footprint, at least not across the 
entire truck fleet.  The LOESS fit shows that larger trucks (those on the right side of the data 
bend in Figure 2-2) have a different trend than smaller trucks, and after about 55 sq ft, no 
longer proportionally increases in weight.  The same pattern is seen in Figure 2-1 and Figure 
2-2 above.

includes proportion α of the points, and these have tricubic weighting (proportional to (1 - (dist/maxdist)^3)^3.

Figure 2-3 Relationship between Weight and Footprint in Agencies’ MY2008-Based Market Forecast 
 
 
To further pursue this topic, weight divided by footprint (WT/FP) can be thought of as 
a “density” of a vehicle (although dimensionally it has units of pressure).  As seen in Figure 
2-4, the trend in WT/FP in the agencies’ MY2008-based market forecast is different in trucks 
than in cars.  The linear trend on cars is an increase in WT/FP as footprint increases (Figure 
2-4).  In contrast, light trucks do not consistently increase in WT/FP ratio as the vehicles grow 
larger, but WT/FP actually decreases (Figure 2-4).

Figure 2-4 Relationship between Weight/FP and Footprint in Agencies’ MY2008-Based Market Forecast 
The heterogeneity of the truck fleet explains part of the WT/FP trend, where the 
pickup truck fleet is largest in footprint, but is also relatively light for its size due to the flat 
bed (Figure 2-5).  Note that the two light truck classes with the smallest WT/FP ratios are 
small and large pickups.  Further, as the only vehicle class with a sales-weighted average 
footprint above 60 square feet, the large pickup trucks have a strong influence on the slope of 
the truck curve.  As the correlation between weight and CO2 is strong (Table 2-1), having 
proportionally lighter vehicles at one extreme of the footprint distribution can bias a curve fit 
to these vehicles.  If no adjustment is made to the curve fitted to the truck fleet, and no other 
compensating flexibilities or adjustments are made available, manufacturers selling 
significant numbers of vehicles at the large end of the truck distribution will face compliance 
burdens that are comparatively more challenging that those faced by manufacturers not 
serving this part of the light truck market.    As noted further below, this consideration 
underlies the agencies’ proposal to change the cutpoint for larger light trucks from 66 feet to 
74 feet, and to steepen the slope of the light truck curve for larger light trucks.

Figure 2-5 Class and the WT/FP distribution 
 
The agencies also investigated the relationship between HP/WT and footprint in the 
agencies’ MY2008-based market forecast (Figure 2-6).  On a sales weighted basis, cars tend 
to become proportionally more powerful as they get larger.  In contrast, there is a minimally 
positive relationship between HP/WT and footprint for light trucks, indicating that light trucks 
become only slightly more powerful as they get larger, but that the trend is not especially 
pronounced.

Figure 2-6 HP/WT v. FP 
 
One factor influencing results of this analysis is the non-homogenous nature of the 
truck fleet; some vehicles at the smaller end of the footprint curve are different in design and 
utility from others at the larger end (leading to the observed bend in the LOESS fit, Figure 
2-6).   There are many high volume four-wheel drive vehicles with smaller footprint in the 
truck fleet (such as the Chevrolet Equinox, Dodge Nitro, Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Hyundai 
Santa Fe, Jeep Liberty, Nissan Rogue, Toyota RAV4, and others) exhibit only select truck 
characteristics.r   By contrast, the largest pickup trucks in the light truck fleet have unique 
aerodynamic and power characteristics that tend to increase CO2 emissions and fuel 
consumption.  These disparities contribute to the slopes of lines fitted to the light truck fleet.   
 
The agencies technical analyses of regulatory alternatives developed using curves 
fitted as described below supported OEM comments that there will be significant compliance 
challenges for the manufacturers of large pickup trucks, and supported the agencies’ policy 
goal of a steeper slope for the light truck curve.  Consequently, the agencies considered 
options including fitting curves developed using results of the analysis described above.. 
Specifically, the agencies note that the WT/FP ratio of the light duty fleet potentially has a

 In most cases, these vehicles have four wheel drive, but no significant towing capability, and no open-bed.  
Many of these vehicles are also offered without four wheel drive, and these two wheel drive versions are 
classified as passenger cars, not light trucks.

large impact on a sales weighted regression.s  The increasing trend in WT/FP versus footprint 
for cars in the 2008 MY baseline would steepen the slope of the car curve, while the 
decreasing trend in WT/FP would flatten the truck slope, as compared to a WT/FP adjusted 
fleet.  This result was reflected in the MYs 2012-2016 final rulemaking,10 where the agencies 
noted the steep car curves resulting from a weighted least squares analysis.  
Based on the above analysis, the agencies also considered adjustments for other 
differences between vehicle models.  Therefore, utilizing the coefficients derived in Equation 
2-1, the agencies also evaluated curve fitting approaches through which fuel consumption and 
CO2 levels were adjusted with respect to weight-to-footprint alone, and in combination with 
power-to-weight.  This adjustment procedure inflates or deflates the fuel economy or CO2 
emissions of each vehicle model based on the extent to which one of the vehicle’s attributes, 
such as power, is higher or lower than average.  As mentioned above, while the agencies 
considered this technique for purposes of fitting curves, the agencies are not proposing a 
multi-attribute standard, as the proposed fuel economy and CO2 targets for each vehicle are 
still functions of footprint alone.  No adjustment would be used in the compliance process. 
The basis for the gallon-per-mile (GPM) adjustments is the sales-weighted linear 
regression discussed in 2.4 (Equation 2-1, Table 2-1).  The coefficients to this equation give 
the impact of the various car attributes on CO2 emissions and fuel consumption in the 
agencies’ MY 2008-based market forecast.  For example, β  gives the impact of weight 
while holding the ratio horsepower to weight constant.  Importantly, this means that as weight 
changes, horsepower must change as well to keep the power/weight ratio constant.  Similarly, β/ gives the CO2 impact of changing the performance of the vehicle while keeping the 
weight constant.  These coefficients were used to perform an adjustment of the gallons per 
mile measure for each vehicle to the respective car or truck—i.e., in the case of a HP/WT 
adjustment, to deflate or inflate the fuel consumption of each vehicle model based on the 
extent to which the vehicle’s power-to-weight ratio is above or below the regression-based 
value at that footprint. 
   
The agencies performed this normalization to adjust for differences in vehicle weight 
per square foot observations in the data discussed in Section 2.4.  This adjustment process 
requires two pieces of information:  the weight coefficient from Equation 2-1 and the average 
weight per footprint (i.e., pounds per square foot) for that vehicle’s group.  Two groups, 
passenger cars and light trucks, were used.  For each group, the average weight per footprint 
was calculated as a weighted average with the weight being the same as in the above 
regression (projected sales by vehicle in 2021).  The equation below indicates how this 
adjustment was carried out. 
  
                                                 
s
 As mentioned above, the agencies also performed the same analysis without sales weighting, and found that the 
WT/FP ratio also had a directionally similar effect on the fitted car and truck curves.

************ + Footprint, + β  
The term in parentheses represents the vehicle’s deviation from an “expected weight.” 
That is, multiplying the average weight per footprint for a group of vehicles (cars or trucks) 
by a specific vehicle’s footprint gives an estimate of the weight of that specific vehicle if it’s 
density were “average,” based on the MY 2008 fleet.  Put another way, this factor represents 
what the weight is “expected” to be, given the vehicle’s footprint, and based on the MY 2008 
fleet. This “expected weight” is then subtracted from the vehicle’s actual weight.  Vehicles 
that are heavier than their “expected weight” will receive a positive value (i.e., a deflated fuel 
economy value) here, while vehicles that are lighter than their “expected weight” will receive 
a negative number (i.e., an inflated fuel economy value). 
This deviation from “expected weight” is then converted to a gallon value by the 
regression coefficient. The units on this coefficient are gallons per mile per pound, as can be 
deduced from equation 1.  This value is then subtracted from the vehicle’s actual gallons per 
mile measure.  Note that the adjusted truck data no longer exhibits the bend seen in Figure 2-1 
and Figure 2-2.

This adjustment serves to reduce the variation in gallons per mile measures caused by 
variation in weight in the agencies’ MY 2008-based market forecast. Importantly, this 
adjustment serves to reduce the fuel consumption (i.e., inflate fuel economy) for those 
vehicles which are heavier than their footprint would suggest while increasing the gallons per 
mile measure (i.e., deflating fuel economy) for those vehicles which are lighter.  For trucks, a 
linear trend is more evident in the data cloud.t   The following table shows the degree of 
adjustment for several vehicle models:

What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-27 
 
The agencies seek comment on the appropriateness of these adjustments, particularly 
regarding whether these adjustments suggest that standards should be defined in terms of 
other attributes in addition to footprint, and whether they may encourage changes other than 
encouraging the application of technology to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 
emissions.  The agencies also seek comment regarding whether these adjustments effectively 
“lock in” through MY 2025 relationships that were observed in MY 2008. 
The above approaches resulted in three data sets each for (a) vehicles without added 
technology and (b) vehicles with technology added to reduce technology differences, any of 
which may provide a reasonable basis for fitting mathematical functions upon which to base 
the slope of the standard curves:  (1) vehicles without any further adjustments; (2) vehicles 
with adjustments reflecting differences in “density” (weight/footprint); and (3) vehicles with 
adjustments reflecting differences in “density,” and adjustments reflecting differences in 
performance (power/weight).  
 
2.4.2.3 What statistical methods did the agencies evaluate? 
Using these data sets, the agencies tested a range of regression methodologies, each 
judged to be possibly reasonable for application to at least some of these data sets.   
2.4.2.3.1 Regression Approach 
In the MYs 2012-2016 final rules, the agencies employed a robust regression approach 
(minimum absolute deviation, or MAD), rather than an ordinary least squares (OLS) 
regression.11  MAD is generally applied to mitigate the effect of outliers in a dataset, and thus 
was employed in that rulemaking as part of our interest in attempting to best represent the 
underlying technology.   NHTSA had used OLS in early development of attribute-based 
CAFE standards, but NHTSA (and then NHTSA and EPA) subsequently chose MAD instead 
of OLS for both the MY 2011 and the MYs 2012-2016 rulemakings.  These decisions on 
regression technique were made both because OLS gives additional emphasis to outliers12 and 
because the MAD approach helped achieve the agencies’ policy goals with regard to curve 
slope in those rulemakings.13  In the interest of taking a fresh look at appropriate regression 
methodologies as promised in the 2012-2016 light duty rulemaking, in developing this 
proposal, the agencies gave full consideration to both OLS and MAD.  The OLS 
representation, as described, uses squared errors, while MAD employs absolute errors and 
thus weights outliers less. 
As noted, one of the reasons stated for choosing MAD over least square regression in 
the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking was that MAD reduced the weight placed on outliers in the 
data.  As seen in Figure 2-1, there clearly are some outliers in the data, mostly to the high CO2 
and fuel consumption side.  However, the agencies have further considered whether it is 
appropriate to classify these vehicles as outliers. Unlike in traditional datasets, these vehicles’ 
performance is not mischaracterized due to errors in their measurement, a common reason for 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-28 
 
outlier classification.  Being certification data, the chances of large measurement errors 
should be near zero, particularly towards high CO2 or fuel consumption.  Thus, they can only 
be outliers in the sense that the vehicle designs are unlike those of other vehicles.  These 
outlier vehicles may include performance vehicles, vehicles with high ground clearance, 
4WD, or boxy designs.  Given that these are equally legitimate on-road vehicle designs, the 
agencies concluded that it would appropriate to reconsider the treatment of these vehicles in 
the regression techniques.  
Based on these considerations as well as the adjustments discussed above, the agencies 
concluded it was not meaningful to run MAD regressions on gpm data that had already been 
adjusted in the manner described above.  Normalizing already reduced the variation in the 
data, and brought outliers towards average values.  This was the intended effect, so the 
agencies deemed it unnecessary to apply an additional remedy to resolve an issue that had 
already been addressed, but we seek comment on the use of robust regression techniques 
under such circumstances. 
2.4.2.3.2 Sales Weighting 
Likewise, the agencies reconsidered employing sales-weighting to represent the data.   
As explained below, the decision to sales weight or not is ultimately based upon a choice 
about how to represent the data, and not by an underlying statistical concern.  Sales weighting 
is used if the decision is made to treat each (mass produced) unit sold as a unique physical 
observation.  Doing so thereby changes the extent to which different vehicle model types are 
emphasized as compared to a non-sales weighted regression.   For example, while total 
General Motors Silverado (332,000) and Ford F-150 (322,000) sales differ by less than 
10,000 in MY 2021 market forecast, 62 F-150s models and 38 Silverado models are reported 
in the agencies baselines.  Without sales-weighting, the F-150 models, because there are more 
of them, are given 63 percent more weight in the regression despite comprising a similar 
portion of the marketplace and a relatively homogenous set of vehicle technologies.   
 The agencies did not use sales weighting in the 2012-2016 rulemaking analysis of the 
curve shapes.  A decision to not perform sales weighting reflects judgment that each vehicle 
model provides an equal amount of information concerning the underlying relationship 
between footprint and fuel economy.  Sales-weighted regression gives the highest sales 
vehicle model types vastly more emphasis than the lowest-sales vehicle model types thus 
driving the regression toward the sales-weighted fleet norm.  For unweighted regression, 
vehicle sales do not matter.  The agencies note that the light truck market forecast shows MY 
2025 sales of 218,000 units for Toyota’s 2WD Sienna, and shows 66 model configurations 
with MY 2025 sales of fewer than 100 units.  Similarly, the agencies’ market forecast shows 
MY 2025 sales of 267,000 for the Toyota Prius, and shows 40 model configurations with 
MY2025 sales of fewer than 100 units.  Sales-weighted analysis would give the Toyota 
Sienna and Prius more than a thousand times the consideration of many vehicle model 
configurations. Sales-weighted analysis would, therefore, cause a large number of vehicle 
model configurations to be virtually ignored in the regressions.14   
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-29 
 
However, the agencies did note in the MYs 2012-2016 final rules that, “sales weighted 
regression would allow the difference between other vehicle attributes to be reflected in the 
analysis, and also would reflect consumer demand.” 15 In reexamining the sales-weighting for 
this analysis, the agencies note that there are low-volume model types account for many of the 
passenger car model types (50 percent of passenger car model types account for 3.3 percent of 
sales), and it is unclear whether the engineering characteristics of these model types should 
equally determine the standard for the remainder of the market.  
In the interest of taking a fresh look at appropriate methodologies as promised in the 
last final rule, in developing this proposal, the agencies gave full consideration to both sales-
weighted and unweighted regressions. 
2.4.2.3.3 Analyses Performed 
We performed regressions describing the relationship between a vehicle’s CO2/fuel 
consumption and its footprint, in terms of various combinations of factors: initial (raw) fleets 
with no technology, versus after technology is applied; sales-weighted versus non-sales 
weighted; and with and without two sets of normalizing factors applied to the observations. 
The agencies excluded diesels and dedicated AFVs because the agencies anticipate that 
advanced gasoline-fueled vehicles are likely to be dominant through MY2025. 
These are depicted graphically in Figures 2-9 through 2-16, below.   
Thus, the basic OLS regression on the initial data (with no technology applied) and no 
sales-weighting represents one perspective on the relation between footprint and fuel 
economy.  Adding sales weighting changes the interpretation to include the influence of sales 
volumes, and thus steps away from representing vehicle technology alone.  Likewise, MAD is 
an attempt to reduce the impact of outliers, but reducing the impact of outliers might perhaps 
be less representative of technical relationships between the variables, although that 
relationship may change over time in reality.  Each combination of methods and data reflects 
a perspective, and the regression results simply reflect that perspective in a simple 
quantifiable manner, expressed as the coefficients determining the line through the average 
(for OLS) or the median (for MAD) of the data.  It is left to policy makers to determine an 
appropriate perspective and to interpret the consequences of the various alternatives.  
We invite comments on the application of the weights as described above, and the 
implications for interpreting the relationship between fuel efficiency and footprint. 
 
2.4.2.4 What results did the agencies obtain? 
Both agencies analyzed the same statistical approaches.  For regressions against data 
including technology normalization, NHTSA used the CAFE modeling system, and EPA used 
EPA’s OMEGA model.  The agencies obtained similar regression results, and have based 
today’s joint proposal on those obtained by NHTSA. 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-30 
 
For illustrative purposes, the set of figures below show the range of curves determined 
by the possible combinations of regression technique, with and without sales weighting, with 
and without the application of technology, and with various adjustments to the gpm variable 
prior to running a regression.  Again, from a statistical perspective, each of these regressions 
simply represents the assumptions employed.  Since they are all univariate linear regressions, 
they describe the line that will result from minimizing the residuals or squared residuals.  
Figures show the results for passenger cars, then light trucks, for ordinary least squares (OLS) 
then similar results for MAD regressions for cars and light trucks, respectively.  The various 
equations are represented by the string of attributes used to define the regression.  See the 
table, Regression Descriptors, below, for the legend.  Thus, for example, the line representing 
ols_LT_wt_ft_adj_init_w should be read as follows:  an OLS regression, for light trucks, 
using data adjusted according to weight to footprint, no technology added, and weighted by 
sales.  
Table 2-6 Regression Descriptors 
 
Notation Description 
ols or mad Ordinary least squares or mean absolute deviation 
PC or LT Passenger car or light truck 
hp_wt_adj Adjustment for horsepower to weight 
wt_ft_adj Adjustment for weight to footprint 
wt_ft_hp_wt_adj Adjustment for both horsepower to weight and weight to footprint 
init or final Vehicles with no technology (initial) or with technology added (final) 
u or w Unweighted or weighted by sales 
 
Thus, the next figure, for example, represents a family of curves (lines) fit using ordinary least 
squares on data for passenger cars, not modified for technology, and which therefore permits 
comparisons of results in terms of the factors that change in each regression.  These factors 
are whether the data are sales-weighted (denoted “w”) or unweighted (denoted “u”), as well as 
the adjustments described above.  Each of these adjustments has an influence on the 
regressions results, depicted in the figures below.

Similar to the figures displaying the results for passenger cars, the figures below 
display regression lines for trucks, first with no technology added, then subsequently, for the

passenger cars.

The MAD regression results below in Figure 2-15 show a grouping of the fitted lines 
similar to that displayed in the OLS fits for trucks.  As expected, an additional reduction in 
divergence is seen in the case where technology has been added, in Figure 2-15, which can be 
ascribed to the reduction in heterogeneity of the fleet brought about by the addition of the 
technology.

2.4.2.5 Which methodology did the agencies choose for this proposal, and 
why is it reasonable? 
The choice among the alternatives presented above was to use the OLS formulation, 
on sales-weighted data, using a fleet that has had technology applied, and after adjusting the 
data for the effect of weight-to-footprint, as described above.  The agencies believe that this 
represents a technically reasonable approach for purposes of developing target curves to 
define the proposed standards, and that it represents a reasonable trade-off among various 
considerations balancing statistical, technical, and policy matters, which include the statistical 
representativeness of the curves considered and the steepness of the curve chosen.  The 
agencies judge the application of technology prior to curve fitting to provide a reasonable 
means—one consistent with the rule’s objective of encouraging manufacturers to add 
technology in order to increase fuel economy—of reducing variation in the data and thereby 
helping to estimate a relationship between fuel consumption/CO2 and footprint. 
Similarly, for the agencies’ current MY 2008-based market-forecast and the agencies’ 
current estimates of future technology effectiveness, the inclusion of the weight-to-footprint 
data adjustment prior to running the regression also helps to improve the fit of the curves by 
reducing the variation in the data, and the agencies believe that the benefits of this adjustment 
for this proposed rule likely outweigh the potential that resultant curves might somehow 
encourage reduced load carrying capability or vehicle performance (note that the we are not 
suggesting that we believe these adjustments will reduce load carrying capability or vehicle 
performance).  In addition to reducing the variability, the truck curve is also steepened, and 
the car curve flattened compared to curves fitted to sales weighted data that do not include 
these normalizations.  The agencies agree with manufacturers of full-size pick-up trucks that 
in order to maintain towing and hauling utility, the engines on pick-up trucks must be more 
powerful, than their low “density” nature would statistically suggest based on the agencies’ 
current MY2008-based market forecast and the agencies’ current estimates of the 
effectiveness of different fuel-saving technologies.  Therefore, it may be more equitable (i.e., 
in terms of relative compliance challenges faced by different light truck manufacturers) to 
adjust the slope of the curve defining fuel economy and CO2 targets. 
The results of the normalized regressions are displayed in Table, below.

As described above, however, other approaches are also technically reasonable, and 
also represent a way of expressing the underlying relationships.  The agencies plan to revisit 
the analysis for the final rule, after updating the underlying market forecast and estimates of 
technology effectiveness, and based on relevant public comments received.  In addition, the 
agencies intend to update the technology cost estimates, which could alter the NPRM analysis 
results and consequently alter the balance of the trade-offs being weighed to determine the 
final curves. 
As shown in the figures below, the line represents the sales-weighted OLS regression 
fit of gallons per mile regressed on footprint, with the data first adjusted by weight to 
footprint, as described above.  This introduces weight as an additional consideration into the 
slope of the footprint curve, although in a manner that adjusts the data as described above, and 
thus maintains a simple graphical interpretation of the curve in a two dimensional space 
(gallons per mile and footprint).

Figure 2-18 Gallons per Mile versus Footprint, Trucks 
(data adjusted by weight to footprint). 
 
In the preceding two figures, passenger car and light truck data is represented for the 
specification chosen, with the size of the observation scaled to sales.  The agencies note with 
regard to light trucks that for the MYs 2012-2016 analysis NPRM and final rule analyses, 
some models of pickups had been aggregated together, when, for example, the same pickup 
had been available in different cab configurations with different wheelbases.16  For the current 
analysis, these models have been disaggregated and are represented individually, which leads 
to a slightly different outcome in the regression results than had they remained aggregated. 
2.4.2.6 Implications of the proposed slope compared to MY 2012-2016 
The proposed slope has several implications relative to the MY 2016 curves, with the 
majority of changes on the truck curve.  With the agencies’ current MY2008-based market 
forecast and the agencies’ current estimates of technology effectiveness, the combination of 
sales weighting and WT/FP normalization produced a car curve slope similar to that finalized 
in the MY 2012-2016 final rulemaking (4.7 g/mile in MY 2016, vs. 4.5 g/mile proposed in 
MY 2017).  By contrast, the truck curve is steeper in MY 2017 than in MY 2016 (4.0 g/mile 
in MY 2016 vs. 4.9 g/mile in MY 2017).  As discussed previously, a steeper slope relaxes the

stringency of targets for larger vehicles relative to those for smaller vehicles, thereby shifting 
relative compliance burdens among manufacturers based on their respective product mix.  
 
2.5 Once the agencies determined the appropriate slope for the sloped part, how did the 
agencies determine the rest of the mathematical function? 
The agencies continue to believe that without a limit at the smallest footprints, the 
function—whether logistic or linear—can reach values that would be unfairly burdensome for 
a manufacturer that elects to focus on the market for small vehicles; depending on the 
underlying data, an unconstrained form could result in stringency levels that are 
technologically infeasible and/or economically impracticable for those manufacturers that 
may elect to focus on the smallest vehicles.   On the other side of the function, without a limit 
at the largest footprints, the function may provide no floor on required fuel economy.  Also, 
the safety considerations that support the provision of a disincentive for downsizing as a 
compliance strategy apply weakly, if at all, to the very largest vehicles.  Limiting the 
function’s value for the largest vehicles thus leads to a function with an inherent absolute 
minimum level of performance, while remaining consistent with safety considerations. 
Just as for slope, in determining the appropriate footprint and fuel economy values for 
the “cutpoints,” the places along the curve where the sloped portion becomes flat, the 
agencies took a fresh look for purposes of this proposal, taking into account the updated 
market forecast and new assumptions about the availability of technologies.  The next two 
sections discuss the agencies’ approach to cutpoints for the passenger car and light truck 
curves separately, as the policy considerations for each vary somewhat. 
 
2.5.1 Cutpoints for PC curve 
The passenger car fleet upon which the agencies have based the target curves for MYs 
2017-2025 is derived from MY 2008 data, as discussed above.  In MY 2008, passenger car 
footprints ranged from 36.7 square feet, the Lotus Exige 5, to 69.3 square feet, the Daimler 
Maybach 62.  In that fleet, several manufacturers offer small, sporty coupes below 41 square 
feet, such as the BMW Z4 and Mini, Honda S2000, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Porsche Carrera and 
911, and Volkswagen New Beetle.  Because such vehicles represent a small portion (less than 
10 percent) of the passenger car market, yet often have performance, utility, and/or structural  
characteristics that could make it technologically infeasible and/or economically 
impracticable for manufacturers focusing on such vehicles to achieve the very challenging 
average requirements that could apply in the absence of a constraint, EPA and NHTSA are 
again proposing to cut off the sloped portion of the passenger car function at 41 square feet, 
consistent with the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking.  The agencies recognize that for 
manufacturers who make small vehicles in this size range, putting the cutpoint at 41 square 
feet creates some incentive to downsize (i.e., further reduce the size, and/or increase the 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-47 
 
production of models currently smaller than 41 square feet) to make it easier to meet the 
target.  Putting the cutpoint here may also create the incentive for manufacturers who do not 
currently offer such models to do so in the future.  However, at the same time, the agencies 
believe that there is a limit to the market for cars smaller than 41 square feet -- most 
consumers likely have some minimum expectation about interior volume, among other things.  
The agencies thus believe that the number of consumers who will want vehicles smaller than 
41 square feet (regardless of how they are priced) is small, and that the incentive to downsize 
to less than 41 square feet in response to this proposal, if present, will be at best minimal.  On 
the other hand, the agencies note that some manufacturers are introducing mini cars not 
reflected in the agencies MY 2008-based market forecast, such as the Fiat 500, to the U.S. 
market, and that the footprint at which the curve is limited may affect the incentive for 
manufacturers to do so.   
Above 56 square feet, the only passenger car models present in the MY 2008 fleet 
were four luxury vehicles with extremely low sales volumes—the Bentley Arnage and three 
versions of the Rolls Royce Phantom.  As in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, NHTSA and 
EPA therefore are proposing again to cut off the sloped portion of the passenger car function 
at 56 square feet. 
While meeting with manufacturers prior to issuing the proposal, the agencies received 
comments from some manufacturers that, combined with slope and overall stringency, using 
41 square feet as the footprint at which to cap the target for small cars would result in unduly 
challenging targets for small cars.  The agencies do not agree.  No specific vehicle need meet 
its target (because standards apply to fleet average performance), and maintaining a sloped 
function toward the smaller end of the passenger car market is important to discourage unsafe 
downsizing, the agencies are thus proposing to again “cut off” the passenger car curve at 41 
square feet, notwithstanding these comments. 
The agencies seek comment on setting cutpoints for the MYs 2017-2025 passenger car 
curves at 41 square feet and 56 square feet. 
 
2.5.2 Cutpoints for LT curve 
  
The light truck fleet upon which the agencies have based the target curves for MYs 
2017-2025, like the passenger car fleet, is derived from MY 2008 data, as discussed in 
Section 2.4 above.  In MY 2008, light truck footprints ranged from 41.0 square feet, the Jeep 
Wrangler, to 77.5 square feet, the Toyota Tundra.  For consistency with the curve for 
passenger cars, the agencies are proposing to cut off the sloped portion of the light truck 
function at the same footprint, 41 square feet, although we recognize that no light trucks are 
currently offered below 41 square feet.  With regard to the upper cutpoint, the agencies heard 
from a number of manufacturers during the discussions leading up to this proposal that the 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-48 
 
location of the cutpoint in the MYs 2012-2016 rules, 66 square feet, meant that the same 
standard applied to all light trucks with footprints of 66 square feet or greater, and that in fact 
the targets for the largest light trucks in the later years of that rulemaking were extremely 
challenging.  Those manufacturers requested that the agencies extend the cutpoint to a larger 
footprint, to reduce targets for the largest light trucks which represent a significant percentage 
of those manufacturers light truck sales.  At the same time, in re-examining the light truck 
fleet data, the agencies concluded that aggregating pickup truck models in the MYs 2012-
2016 rule had led the agencies to underestimate the impact of the different pickup truck model 
configurations above 66 square feet on manufacturers’ fleet average fuel economy and CO2 
levels (as discussed immediately below).  In disaggregating the pickup truck model data, the 
impact of setting the cutpoint at 66 square feet after model year 2016 became clearer to the 
agencies.  
In the agencies’ view, there is legitimate basis for these comments.  The agencies’ 
market forecast includes about 24 vehicle configurations above 74 square feet with a total 
volume of about 50,000 vehicles or less  during any MY in the 2017-2025 time frame.  While 
a relatively small portion of the overall truck fleet, for some manufacturers, these vehicles are 
non-trivial portion of sales.  As noted above, the very largest light trucks have significant 
load-carrying and towing capabilities that make it particularly challenging for manufacturers 
to add fuel economy-improving/CO2-reducing technologies in a way that maintains the full 
functionality of those capabilities.   
Considering manufacturer CBI and our estimates of the impact of the 66 square foot 
cutpoint for future model years, the agencies have initially determined to adopt curves that 
transition to a different cut point.   While noting that no specific vehicle need meet its target 
(because standards apply to fleet average performance), we believe that the information 
provided to us by manufacturers and our own analysis supports the gradual extension of the 
cutpoint for large light trucks in this proposal from 66 square feet in MY 2016 out to a larger 
footprint square feet before MY 2025.

*Proposed truck cutpoints for MY 2025 shown in red, car cutpoints shown in green 
The agencies are proposing to phase in the higher cutpoint for the truck curve in order 
to avoid any backsliding from the MY 2016 standard.  A target that is feasible in one model 
year should never become less feasible in a subsequent model year—manufacturers should 
have no reason to remove fuel economy-improving/CO2-reducing technology from a vehicle 
once it has been applied.  Put another way, the agencies are proposing to not allow “curve 
crossing” from one model year to the next.  In proposing MYs 2011-2015 CAFE standards 
and promulgating MY 2011 standards, NHTSA proposed and requested comment on avoiding 
curve crossing, as an “anti-backsliding measure.”17  The MY 2016 2 cycle test curves are 
therefore a floor for the MYs 2017-2025 curves.  For passenger cars, which have minimal 
change in slope from the MY 2012-2016 rulemakings and no change in cut points, there are 
no curve crossing issues in the proposed standards. 
The minimum stringency determination was done using the two cycle curves.  
Stringency adjustments for air conditioning and other credits were calculated after curves that 
did not cross were determined in two cycle space.  The year over year increase in these 
adjustments cause neither the GHG nor CAFE curves (with A/C) to contact the 2016 curves 
when charted.

2-50 
 
2.5.3 Once the agencies determined the complete mathematical function shape, 
how did the agencies adjust the curves to develop the proposed standards and 
regulatory alternatives? 
The curves discussed above all reflect the addition of technology to individual vehicle 
models to reduce technology differences between vehicle models before fitting curves.  This 
application of technology was conducted not to directly determine the proposed standards, but 
rather for purposes of technology adjustments, and set aside considerations regarding 
potential rates of application (i.e., phase-in caps), and considerations regarding economic 
implications of applying specific technologies to specific vehicle models.   The following 
sections describe further adjustments to the curves discussed above, that affect both the shape 
of the curve (section 2.5.3.1), and the location of the curve (2.5.3.2), that helped the agencies 
determine curves that defined the proposed standards. 
2.5.3.1 Adjusting for Year over Year Stringency 
As in the MYs 2012-2016 rules, the agencies developed curves defining regulatory 
alternatives for consideration by “shifting” these curves.  For the MYs 2012-2016 rules, the 
agencies did so on an absolute basis, offsetting the fitted curve by the same value (in gpm or 
g/mi) at all footprints.  In developing this proposal, the agencies have reconsidered the use of 
this approach, and have concluded that after MY 2016, curves should be offset on a relative 
basis—that is, by adjusting the entire gpm-based curve (and, equivalently, the CO2 curve) by 
the same percentage rather than the same absolute value.  The agencies’ estimates of the 
effectiveness of these technologies are all expressed in relative terms—that is, each 
technology (with the exception of A/C)  is estimated to reduce fuel consumption (the inverse 
of fuel economy) and CO2 emissions by a specific percentage of fuel consumption without the 
technology.  It is, therefore, more consistent with the agencies’ estimates of technology 
effectiveness to develop the proposed standards and regulatory alternatives by applying a 
proportional offset to curves expressing fuel consumption or emissions as a function of 
footprint.  In addition, extended indefinitely (and without other compensating adjustments), 
an absolute offset would eventually (i.e., at very high average stringencies) produce negative 
(gpm or g/mi) targets.  Relative offsets avoid this potential outcome.  Relative offsets do 
cause curves to become, on a fuel consumption and CO2 basis, flatter at greater average 
stringencies; however, as discussed above, this outcome remains consistent with the agencies’ 
estimates of technology effectiveness.  In other words, given a relative decrease in average 
required fuel consumption or CO2 emissions, a curve that is flatter by the same relative 
amount should be equally challenging in terms of the potential to achieve compliance through 
the addition of fuel-saving technology. 
On this basis, and considering that the “flattening” occurs gradually for the regulatory 
alternatives the agencies have evaluated, the agencies tentatively conclude that this approach 
to offsetting the curves to develop year-by-year regulatory alternatives neither re-creates a 
situation in which manufacturers are likely to respond to standards in ways that compromise 
highway safety, nor undoes the attribute-based standard’s more equitable balancing of 
compliance burdens among disparate manufacturers.  The agencies invite comment on these 
What are the Attribute-Based Curves the Agencies are Proposing 
2-51 
 
conclusions, and on any other means that might avoid the potential outcomes—in particular, 
negative fuel consumption and CO2 targets—discussed above. 
2.5.3.2 Adjusting for anticipated improvements to mobile air conditioning 
systems  
The fuel economy values in the agencies’ market forecast are based on the 2-cycle 
(i.e., city and highway) fuel economy test and calculation procedures that do not reflect 
potential improvements in air conditioning system efficiency, refrigerant leakage, or 
refrigerant Global Warming Potential (GWP).  Recognizing that there are significant and cost 
effective potential air conditioning system improvements available in the rulemaking 
timeframe (discussed in detail in Chapter 5 of the draft joint TSD), the agencies are increasing 
the stringency of the target curves based on the agencies’ assessment of the capability of 
manufacturers to implement these changes.  For the proposed CAFE standards and 
alternatives, an offset is included based on air conditioning system efficiency improvements, 
as these improvements are the only improvements that effect vehicle fuel economy.  For the 
proposed GHG standards and alternatives, a stringency increase is included based on air 
conditioning system efficiency, leakage and refrigerant improvements.  As discussed above in 
Chapter 5 of the join TSD, the air conditioning system improvements affect a vehicle’s fuel 
efficiency or CO2 emissions performance as an additive stringency increase, as compared to 
other fuel efficiency improving technologies which are multiplicative. Therefore, in adjusting 
target curves for improvements in the air conditioning system performance, the agencies are 
adjusting the target curves by additive stringency increases (or vertical shifts) in the curves. 
For the GHG target curves, the offset for air conditioning system performance is being 
handled in the same manner as for the MY 2012-2016 rules.    For the CAFE target curves, 
NHTSA for the first time is proposing to account for potential improvements in air 
conditioning system performance.  Using this methodology, the agencies first use a 
multiplicative stringency adjustment for the sloped portion of the curves to reflect the 
effectiveness on technologies other that air conditioning system technologies, creating a series 
of curve shapes that are “fanned” based on two-cycle performance.  Then the curves are offset 
vertically by the air conditioning improvement by an equal amount at every point.

Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

Chapter 3:  Technologies Considered in the Agencies’ Analysis 
This Chapter of the joint TSD describes the technologies NHTSA and EPA evaluated 
as potential inputs in their respective models and provides estimates of the technologies’ 
costs, effectiveness and availability. This Chapter also describes, in general terms, how the 
agencies use these inputs in their respective models.  
The agencies assume, in this analysis, that manufacturers will add a variety of 
technologies to each of their vehicle model platforms in order to improve their fuel economy 
and GHG performance.   In order to evaluate proposed CAFE and GHG standards and 
regulatory alternatives, it is essential to understand what is feasible within the timeframe of 
the proposed rule.  Determining the technological feasibility of proposed 2017-2025 standards 
requires a thorough study of the technologies available to the manufacturers during that 
timeframe.  This chapter includes an assessment of the cost, effectiveness, and the 
availability, development time, and manufacturability of the technology within either the 
normal redesign periods of a vehicle line or in the design of a new vehicle.  As we describe 
below, when a technology can be applied can affect the cost as well as the technology 
penetration rate (or phase-in caps) that are assumed in the analysis.   
The agencies considered technologies in many categories that manufacturers could use 
to improve the fuel economy and reduce CO2 emissions of their vehicles during the MYs 
2017-2025 timeframe.  Many of the technologies described in this chapter are available today, 
are well known, and could be incorporated into vehicles once product development decisions 
are made.  These are “nearer-term” technologies and are identical or very similar to those 
considered in the MYs 2012-2016 final rule analysis (of course, many of these technologies 
will likely be applied to the light-duty fleet in order to achieve the 2012-2016 CAFE and 
GHG standards; such technologies would be part of the 2016 reference case for this 
analysisa).  Other technologies considered, may not currently be in production, but are under 
development and are expected to be in production in the next five to ten years.  Examples of 
these technologies are downsized and turbocharged engines operating at combustion pressures 
even higher than today’s turbocharged engines, and an emerging hybrid architecture mated 
with an 8 speed transmission—a combination that is not available today.  These are 
technologies which the agencies believe can, for the most part, be applied both to cars and 
trucks, and which are expected to achieve significant improvements in fuel economy and 
reductions in CO2 emissions at reasonable costs in the MYs 2017 to 2025 timeframe.  The 
agencies note that we did not consider in our analysis technologies that are currently in an 
initial stage of research because of the uncertainties involved in estimating their costs and 
effectiveness and in assessing whether the technologies will be ready to implement at 
significant penetration rates during the timeframe of this proposal.  Examples of such

technologies would be camless valve actuation and fuel cell vehicles.b  The agencies 
acknowledge that due to the relatively long period between the date of this proposal and the 
rulemaking timeframe, the possibility exists that new and innovative technologies not 
considered in this analysis will make their way into the fleet (perhaps even in significant 
numbers).  The agencies plan to re-assess these technologies, along with all of the 
technologies considered in this proposal, as part of our mid-term evaluation. 
3.1 What Technologies did the agencies consider for the proposed 2017-2025 standards? 
The technologies considered for this NPRM analysis by NHTSA and EPA are briefly 
described below.  They fit generally into five broad categories:  engine, transmission, vehicle, 
electrification/accessory, and hybrid technologies.  A more detailed description of each 
technology, and the technology’s costs and effectiveness, is described in greater detail in 
section 3.4 of this TSD. 
Types of engine technologies applied in this NPRM analysis to improve fuel economy 
and reduce CO2 emissions include the following: 
• Low-friction lubricants – low viscosity and advanced low friction lubricants oils 
are now available with improved performance and better lubrication. 
• Reduction of engine friction losses – can be achieved through low-tension piston 
rings, roller cam followers, improved material coatings, more optimal thermal 
management, piston surface treatments, and other improvements in the design of 
engine components and subsystems that improve engine operation.  
• Second level of low-friction lubricants and engine friction reduction – As 
technologies advance between now and the rulemaking timeframe, there will 
further developments enabling lower viscosity and lower friction lubricants and 
more engine friction reduction technologies available.  
• Cylinder deactivation – deactivates the intake and exhaust valves and prevents fuel 
injection into some cylinders during light-load operation.  The engine runs 
temporarily as though it were a smaller engine which substantially reduces 
pumping losses  
• Variable valve timing – alters the timing or phase of the intake valve, exhaust 
valve, or both, primarily to reduce pumping losses, increase specific power, and 
control residual gases. 
                                                 
b
 Fuel cell vehicles may be especially useful in lieu of full battery electric technology for the larger trucks.  We 
may consider this possibility for the final rule.   
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-3 
 
• Discrete variable valve lift – increases efficiency by optimizing air flow over a 
broader range of engine operation which reduces pumping losses.  Accomplished 
by controlled switching between two or more cam profile lobe heights. 
• Continuous variable valve lift – is an electromechanically controlled system in 
which cam period and phasing is changed as lift height is controlled.  This yields a 
wide range of performance optimization and volumetric efficiency, including 
enabling the engine to be valve throttled. 
• Stoichiometric gasoline direct-injection technology – injects fuel at high pressure 
directly into the combustion chamber to improve cooling of the air/fuel charge 
within the cylinder, which allows for higher compression ratios and increased 
thermodynamic efficiency.   
• Turbocharging and downsizing – increases the available airflow and specific 
power level, allowing a reduced engine size while maintaining performance.  This 
reduces pumping losses at lighter loads in comparison to a larger engine. In this 
NPRM, the agencies considered three levels of boosting, 18 bar brake mean 
effective pressure (BMEP), 24 bar BMEP and 27 bar BMEP, as well as four levels 
of downsizing, from I4 to smaller I4 or I3, from V6 to I4 and from V8 to V6 and 
I4. 18 bar BMEP is applied with 33 percent downsizing, 24 bar BMEP is applied 
with 50 percent downsizing and 27 bar BMEP is applied with 56 percent 
downsizing.  To achieve the same level of torque when downsizing the 
displacement of an engine by 50 percent, approximately double the manifold 
absolute pressure (2 bar) is required.  Accordingly, with 56 percent downsizing, 
the manifold absolute pressure range increases up to 2.3 bar.  Ricardo states in 
their 2011 vehicle simulation project report that advanced engines in the 2020–
2025 timeframe can be expected to have advanced boosting systems that increase 
the pressure of the intake charge up to 3 bar1.  Refer to Section 3.3.1.2.22.2 for 
examples of Ricardo-modeled displacements used for turbocharged and downsized 
engines in each vehicle class. 
• Exhaust-gas recirculation boost – increases the exhaust-gas recirculation used in 
the combustion process to increase thermal efficiency and reduce pumping losses.  
Levels of exhaust gas recirculation approach 25% by volume in the highly boosted 
engines modeled by Ricardo (this, in turn raises the boost requirement by 
approximately 25%).  This technology is only applied to 24 bar and 27 bar BMEP 
engines in this NPRM.  
• Diesel engines – have several characteristics that give superior fuel efficiency, 
including reduced pumping losses due to lack of (or greatly reduced) throttling, 
and a combustion cycle that operates at a higher compression ratio, with a very 
lean air/fuel mixture, than an equivalent-performance gasoline engine.  This 
technology requires additional enablers, such as NOx trap catalyst after-treatment 
or selective catalytic reduction NOx after-treatment. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-4 
 
Types of transmission technologies applied in this NPRM include: 
• Improved automatic transmission controls – optimizes shift schedule to maximize 
fuel efficiency under wide ranging conditions, and minimizes losses associated 
with torque converter slip through lock-up or modulation. 
• Six- and seven-speed automatic transmissions – the gear ratio spacing and 
transmission ratio are optimized to enable the engine to operate in a more efficient 
operating range over a broader range of vehicle operating conditions. 
• Dual clutch transmission (DCT) - are similar to a manual transmission, but the 
vehicle controls shifting and launch functions. A dual-clutch automated shift 
manual transmission uses separate clutches for even-numbered and odd-numbered 
gears, so the next expected gear is pre-selected, which allows for faster, smoother 
shifting. 
• Eight-speed automatic transmissions – the gear transmission ratio are optimized to 
enable the engine to operate in a more efficient operating range over a broader 
range of vehicle operating conditions. This technology is applied after 2016. 
• Shift Optimization – tries to keep the engine operating near its most efficient point 
for a give power demand. The shift controller emulates a traditional CVT by 
selecting the best gear ratio for fuel economy at a given required vehicle power 
level to take full advantage of high BMEP engines. 
• Manual 6-speed transmission – offers an additional gear ratio, often with a higher 
overdrive gear ratio, than a 5-speed manual transmission.  
• High Efficiency Gearbox (automatic, DCT or manual) – continuous improvement 
in seals, bearings and clutches, super finishing of gearbox parts, and development 
in the area of lubrication, all aimed at reducing frictional and other parasitic load in 
the system for an automatic, DCT or manual type transmission. 
Types of vehicle technologies applied in this NPRM analysis include: 
• Low-rolling-resistance tires – have characteristics that reduce frictional losses 
associated with the energy dissipated in the deformation of the tires under load, 
therefore reducing the energy needed to move the vehicle. There are two levels of 
rolling resistance reduction considered in this NRPM analysis targeting at 10 
percent and 20 percent rolling resistance reduction respectively. 
• Low-drag brakes – reduce the sliding friction of disc brake pads on rotors when 
the brakes are not engaged because the brake pads are pulled away from the rotors. 
• Front or secondary axle disconnect for four-wheel drive systems – provides a 
torque distribution disconnect between front and rear axles when torque is not 
required for the non-driving axle.  This results in the reduction of associated 
parasitic energy losses. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-5 
 
• Aerodynamic drag reduction – is achieved by changing vehicle shape or reducing 
frontal area, including skirts, air dams, underbody covers, and more aerodynamic 
side view mirrors. There are two levels of aerodynamic drag reduction considered 
in this NPRM analysis targeting 10 percent and 20 percent rolling resistance 
reduction respectively. 
• Mass reduction– Mass reduction encompasses a variety of techniques ranging 
from improved design and better component integration to application of lighter 
and higher-strength materials.  Mass reduction can lead to collateral fuel economy 
and GHG benefits due to downsized engines and/or ancillary systems 
(transmission, steering, brakes, suspension, etc.).  The maximum mass reduction 
level considered in this NPRM is 20 percent. 
Types of electrification/accessory and hybrid technologies applied in this NPRM 
include: 
• Electric power steering (EPS) and electro-hydraulic power steering (EHPS) – is 
an electrically-assisted steering system that has advantages over traditional 
hydraulic power steering because it replaces a continuously operated hydraulic 
pump, thereby reducing parasitic losses from the accessory drive. 
• Improved accessories (IACC) – may include high efficiency alternators, 
electrically driven (i.e., on-demand) water pumps and cooling and even 
regenerative braking.  This excludes other electrical accessories such as electric oil 
pumps and electrically driven air conditioner compressors. There are two levels of 
IACC applied in this NPRM analysis.  The second level of IACC includes 
alternator regenerative braking on top of what are included in the first level of 
IACC. 
• Air Conditioner Systems – These technologies include improved hoses, connectors 
and seals for leakage control.  They also include improved compressors, expansion 
valves, heat exchangers and the control of these components for the purposes of 
improving tailpipe CO2 emissions and fuel economy when the A/C is operating.   
These technologies are covered separately in Chapter 5 of this draft joint TSD.  
• 12-volt Stop-start – also known as idle-stop or 12V micro hybrid and commonly 
implemented as a 12-volt belt-driven integrated starter-generator, this is the most 
basic hybrid system that facilitates idle-stop capability.  Along with other enablers, 
this system replaces a common alternator with an enhanced power starter-
alternator, both belt driven, and a revised accessory drive system. 
• P2 Hybrid – P2 hybrid is a newly emerging hybrid technology that uses a 
transmission integrated electric motor placed between the engine and a gearbox or 
CVT, much like the IMA system described above except with a wet or dry 
separation clutch which is used to decouple the motor/transmission from the 
engine.  In addition, a P2 Hybrid would typically be equipped with a larger electric 
machine.  Engaging the clutch allows all-electric operation and more efficient

brake-energy recovery.  Disengaging the clutch allows efficient coupling of the 
engine and electric motor and, when combined with a DCT transmission, reduces 
gear-train losses relative to power-split or 2-mode hybrid systems.   
• Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) – are hybrid electric vehicles with the 
means to charge their battery packs from an outside source of electricity (usually 
the electric grid).  These vehicles have larger battery packs with more energy 
storage and a greater capability to be discharged.  They also use a control system 
that allows the battery pack to be substantially depleted under electric-only or 
blended mechanical/electric operation. 
• Electric vehicles (EV) – are vehicles with all-electric drive and with vehicle 
systems powered by energy-optimized batteries charged primarily from grid 
electricity. EVs with 75 mile, 100 mile and 150 mile ranges have been included as 
potential technologies. 
Types of accessory/hybridization/electrification technologies discussed but not applied 
in this NPRM analysis include: 
• Higher Voltage Stop-Start/Belt Integrated Starter Generator (BISG) – sometimes 
referred to as a mild hybrid, BISG provides idle-stop capability and uses a high 
voltage battery with increased energy capacity over typical automotive batteries.  
The higher system voltage allows the use of a smaller, more powerful electric 
motor and reduces the weight of the motor, inverter, and battery wiring harnesses.  
This system replaces a standard alternator with an enhanced power, higher voltage, 
higher efficiency starter-alternator, that is belt driven and that can recover braking 
energy while the vehicle slows down (regenerative braking). 
• Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)/Crank integrated starter generator (CISG) – 
provides idle-stop capability and uses a high voltage battery with increased energy 
capacity over typical automotive batteries.  The higher system voltage allows the 
use of a smaller, more powerful electric motor and reduces the weight of the 
wiring harness.  This system replaces a standard alternator with an enhanced 
power, higher voltage and higher efficiency starter-alternator that is crankshaft 
mounted and can recover braking energy while the vehicle slows down 
(regenerative braking).  The IMA technology is not included as an enabling 
technology in this analysis, although it is included as a baseline technology 
because it exists in the 2008 baseline fleet. 
• Power-split Hybrid (PSHEV) – is a hybrid electric drive system that replaces the 
traditional transmission with a single planetary gearset and a motor/generator.  
This motor/generator uses the engine to either charge the battery or supply 
additional power to the drive motor.  A second, more powerful motor/generator is 
permanently connected to the vehicle’s final drive and always turns with the 
wheels.  The planetary gear splits engine power between the first motor/generator 
and the drive motor to either charge the battery or supply power to the wheels.

The power-split hybrid technology is not included as an enabling technology in 
this analysis, although it is included as a baseline technology because it exists in 
the 2008 baseline fleet. 
• 2-Mode Hybrid (2MHEV) – is a hybrid electric drive system that uses an 
adaptation of a conventional stepped-ratio automatic transmission by replacing 
some of the transmission clutches with two electric motors that control the ratio of 
engine speed to vehicle speed, while clutches allow the motors to be bypassed.  
This improves both the transmission torque capacity for heavy-duty applications 
and reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions at highway speeds relative to 
other types of hybrid electric drive systems. The 2-mode hybrid technology is not 
included as an enabling technology in this analysis, although it is included as a 
baseline technology because it exists in the 2008 baseline fleet. 
3.2 How did the agencies determine the costs of each of these technologies? 
3.2.1 Direct Costs 
3.2.1.1 Costs from Tear-down Studies 
There are a number of technologies that have been costed using a rigorous tear-down 
method described in this section.  As a general matter, the agencies believe that the best 
method to derive technology cost estimates is to conduct studies involving tear-down and 
analysis of actual vehicle components.  A “tear-down” involves breaking down a technology 
into its fundamental parts and manufacturing processes by completely disassembling actual 
vehicles and vehicle subsystems and precisely determining what is required for its production.  
The result of the tear-down is a “bill of materials” for each and every part of the vehicle or 
vehicle subsystem.  This tear-down method of costing technologies is often used by 
manufacturers to benchmark their products against competitive products.  Historically, 
vehicle and vehicle component tear-down has not been done on a large scale by researchers 
and regulators due to the expense required for such studies.  While tear-down studies are 
highly accurate at costing technologies for the year in which the study is intended, their 
accuracy, like that of all cost projections, may diminish over time as costs are extrapolated 
further into the future because of uncertainties in predicting commodities (and raw material) 
prices, labor rates, and manufacturing practices.  The projected costs may be higher or lower 
than predicted.   
Over the past several years, EPA has contracted with FEV, Inc. and its subcontractor 
Munro & Associates to conduct tear-down cost studies for a number of key technologies 
evaluated by the agencies in assessing the feasibility of future GHG and CAFE standards.  
The analysis methodology included procedures to scale the tear-down results to smaller and 
larger vehicles, and also to different technology configurations.  FEV’s methodology was 
documented in a report published as part of the MY 2012-2016 rulemaking process, detailing 
the costing of the first tear-down conducted in this work (#1 in the below list).2  This report 
was peer reviewed by experts in the industry and revised by FEV in response to the peer 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-8 
 
review comments.3  Subsequent tear-down studies (#2-5 in the below list) were documented 
in follow-up FEV reports made available in the public docket for the MY 2012-2016 
rulemaking.4 
Since then, FEV’s work under this contract work assignment has continued.  
Additional cost studies have been completed and are available for public review.5  The most 
extensive study, performed after the MY 2012-2016 Final Rule, involved whole-vehicle tear-
downs of a 2010 Ford Fusion power-split hybrid and a conventional 2010 Ford Fusion.  (The 
latter served as a baseline vehicle for comparison.)  In addition to providing power-split HEV 
costs, the results for individual components in these vehicles were subsequently used to cost 
another hybrid technology, the P2 hybrid, which employs similar hardware.  This approach to 
costing P2 hybrids was undertaken because P2 HEVs were not yet in volume production at 
the time of hardware procurement for tear-down.  Finally, an automotive lithium-polymer 
battery was torn down and costed to provide supplemental battery costing information to that 
associated with the NiMH battery in the Fusion.  This HEV cost work, including the extension 
of results to P2 HEVs, has been extensively documented in a new report prepared by FEV.6  
Because of the complexity and comprehensive scope of this HEV analysis, EPA 
commissioned a separate peer review focused exclusively on it.  Reviewer comments 
generally supported FEV’s methodology and results, while including a number of suggestions 
for improvement which were subsequently incorporated into FEV’s analysis and final report.   
The peer review comments and responses are available in the rulemaking docket.7 8 
Over the course of this work assignment, teardown-based studies were performed on 
the technologies listed below.  These completed studies provide a thorough evaluation of the 
new technologies’ costs relative to their baseline (or replaced) technologies.   
1. Stoichiometric gasoline direct injection (SGDI) and turbocharging with engine 
downsizing (T-DS) on a DOHC (dual overhead cam) I4 engine, replacing a 
conventional DOHC I4 engine. 
2. SGDI and T-DS on a SOHC (single overhead cam) on a V6 engine, replacing a 
conventional 3-valve/cylinder SOHC V8 engine. 
3. SGDI and T-DS on a DOHC I4 engine, replacing a DOHC V6 engine.  
4. 6-speed automatic transmission (AT), replacing a 5-speed AT. 
5. 6-speed wet dual clutch transmission (DCT) replacing a 6-speed AT. 
6. 8-speed AT replacing a 6-speed AT. 
7. 8-speed DCT replacing a 6-speed DCT. 
8. Power-split hybrid (Ford Fusion with I4 engine) compared to a conventional 
vehicle (Ford Fusion with V6).  The results from this tear-down were extended to 
address P2 hybrids.  In addition, costs from individual components in this tear-
down study were used by the agencies in developing cost estimates for PHEVs and 
EVs. 
9. Mild hybrid with stop-start technology (Saturn Vue with I4 engine), replacing a 
conventional I4 engine. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-9 
 
10. Fiat Multi-Air engine technology.  (Although results from this cost study are 
included in the rulemaking docket, they were not used by the agencies in this 
rulemaking’s technical analyses.) 
In addition, FEV and EPA extrapolated the engine downsizing costs for the following 
scenarios that were based on the above study cases:  
1. Downsizing a SOHC 2 valve/cylinder V8 engine to a DOHC V6. 
2. Downsizing a DOHC V8 to a DOHC V6. 
3. Downsizing a SOHC V6 engine to a DOHC 4 cylinder engine. 
4. Downsizing a DOHC 4 cylinder engine to a DOHC 3 cylinder engine. 
The agencies have relied on the findings of FEV for estimating the cost of the 
technologies covered by the tear-down studies.  However, we note that FEV based their costs 
on the assumption that these technologies would be mature when produced in large volumes 
(450,000 units or more for each component or subsystem).  If manufacturers are not able to 
employ the technology at the volumes assumed in the FEV analysis with fully learned costs, 
then the costs for each of these technologies would be expected to be higher.  There is also the 
potential for stranded capitalc if technologies are introduced too rapidly for some indirect 
costs to be fully recovered.  While the agencies consider the FEV tear-down analysis results 
to be generally valid for the 2017-2025 timeframe for fully mature, high sales volumes, we 
have had FEV perform supplemental analysis to consider potential stranded capital costs, and 
have included these  in our cost estimates.  The issue of stranded capital is discussed in detail 
in Section 3.2.2.3 of this draft TSD.  
3.2.1.2 Costs of HEV, PHEV, EV, and FCEVs 
The agencies have also reconsidered the costs for HEVs, PHEVs, EVs, and FCEVs 
since the MY 2012-2016 rulemaking and the TAR as the result of two issues.  The first issue 
is that electrified vehicle technologies are developing rapidly and we sought to capture the 
results from the most recent analyses.  The second issue is that the analysis for the MYs 2012-
2016 final rule employed a single $/kWhr estimate, and did not consider the specific vehicle 
and technology application for the battery when we estimated the cost of the battery.d  
Specifically, batteries used in HEVs (high power density applications) versus EVs (high 
energy density applications) need to be considered appropriately to reflect the design 
differences, the chemical material usage differences, and the differences in cost per kW-hr as 
the power to energy ratio of the battery changes for different applications.  To address these 
issues for this proposal, the agencies have used a battery cost model developed by Argonne 
National Laboratory (ANL) for the Vehicle Technologies Program of the U.S. Department of 
                                                 
c
 The potential for stranded capital occurs when manufacturing equipment and facilities cannot be used in the 
production of a new technology. 
d
 However, we believe that this had little impact on the results of the cost analyses in support of the MYs 2012-
2016 final rule, as the agencies projected that the standards could be met with an increase of less than 2 percent 
penetration of hybrid technology and no increase in plug-in or full electric vehicle technology.

Energy (DoE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.9  The model developed by 
ANL allows users to estimate unique battery pack cost using user customized input sets for 
different types of electrified powertrains, such as strong hybrid, PHEV and EV.  Since the 
publication of the TAR, ANL’s battery cost model has been peer-reviewed and ANL has 
updated the model to incorporate suggestions from peer-reviewers.10 This newly updated 
model is used in this NPRM analysis and we discuss our updated battery costs in section in 
Section 3.4.3.9.  The agencies also added new configurations of HEV, PHEV and EV to the 
analysis that include the P2 HEV configuration, two different all-electric mileage ranges for 
PHEVs (20 and 40 in-use miles) and three different mileage ranges for EVs (75, 100 and 150 
in-use miles).  Details regarding these vehicle technologies are discussed in sections 3.4.3.6.4 
and 3.4.3.6.5. 
3.2.1.3 Direct Manufacturing Costs 
  Building on the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies took a fresh look at 
technology cost and effectiveness values for purposes of this joint NPRM.  For costs, the 
agencies reconsidered both the direct or “piece” costs and indirect costs of individual 
components of technologies.  For the direct costs that were not developed through the FEV 
tear-down studies, the agencies generally followed a bill of materials (BOM) approach.  A bill 
of materials, in a general sense, is a list of components that make up a system—in this case, 
an item of fuel economy-improving technology.  In order to determine what a system costs, 
one of the first steps is to determine its components and what they cost. 
NHTSA and EPA estimated these components and their costs based on a number of 
sources for cost-related information.  The objective was to use those sources of information 
considered to be most credible for projecting the costs of individual vehicle technologies.  For 
those cost estimates that are fundamentally unchanged since the 2012-2016 final rule and/or 
the 2010 TAR (we make note of these in Section 3.4, below), we have a full description of the 
sources used in Chapter 3 of the final joint TSD supporting that rule.11,12  For those costs that 
have been updated since those analyses (e.g., battery pack cost, costs based on more recent 
tear down analyses, etc.), we note their sources in Section 3.4, below.  We have also 
considered input from manufacturers and suppliers gathered either through meetings 
following the 2010 TAR or in comment submitted in response to the 2010 TAR, some of 
which cannot be shared publicly in detailed form but, where used, we make note of it without 
violating its confidentiality.  Note that a summary of comments on the 2010 TAR, with the 
agencies’ responses, was published as a “Supplemental Notice of Intent” in December of 
2010.13   As discussed throughout this chapter, the agencies have reviewed, revalidated or 
updated cost estimates for individual components based on the latest information available.   
 Once costs were determined, they were adjusted to ensure that they were all expressed 
in 2009 dollars using the GDP price deflator as described in section 3.2.4.  Indirect costs were 
accounted for using the ICM approach developed by EPA and explained below.  NHTSA and 
EPA also considered how costs should be adjusted to reflect manufacturer learning as 
discussed below.  Additionally, costs were adjusted by modifying or scaling content 
assumptions to account for differences across the range of vehicle sizes and functional 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-11 
 
requirements, and adjusted the associated material cost impacts to account for the revised 
content, although these adjustments were different for each agency due to the different vehicle 
subclasses used in their respective models. 
3.2.2 Indirect Costs 
3.2.2.1 Indirect Cost Multiplier Changes 
As discussed in greater detail below, the agencies have revised the markups used to 
estimate indirect costs.  The first change was to normalize the ICM values to be consistent 
with the historical average retail price equivalent (RPE) of 1.5, rather than the single year that 
the RTI study examined.  This was done by applying a factor of .5/.46 to all indirect cost 
elements.  The second change was to re-consider the markup factors and the data used to 
generate them.  The result on this new thinking is to increase the markup in all cases.  The 
final change is the way in which the ICM factors are applied.  In previous analyses ICMs 
were applied to the learned value of direct costs.  However, since learning influences direct 
costs only, the agencies were concerned that this could overstate the impact of learning on 
total costs.  Indirect costs are thus now established based on the initial value of direct costs 
and held constant until the long-term ICM is applied.  This is done for all ICM factors except 
warranties, which are influenced by the learned value of direct costs.  
3.2.2.2 Cost markups to account for indirect costs 
To produce a unit of output, auto manufacturers incur direct and indirect costs.  Direct 
costs include the cost of materials and labor costs.  Indirect costs may be related to production 
(such as research and development [R&D]), corporate operations (such as salaries, pensions, 
and health care costs for corporate staff), or selling (such as transportation, dealer support, and 
marketing).  Indirect costs are generally recovered by allocating a share of the costs to each 
unit of goods sold.  Although it is possible to account for direct costs allocated to each unit of 
goods sold, it is more challenging to account for indirect costs allocated to a unit of goods 
sold.  To make a cost analysis process more feasible, markup factors, which relate total 
indirect costs to total direct costs, have been developed.  These factors are often referred to as 
retail price equivalent (RPE) multipliers. 
Cost analysts and regulatory agencies including EPA and NHTSA have frequently 
used these multipliers to estimate the resultant impact on costs associated with manufacturers’ 
responses to regulatory requirements.  The best approach to determining the impact of 
changes in direct manufacturing costs on a manufacturer’s indirect costs would be to actually 
estimate the cost impact on each indirect cost element.  However, doing this within the 
constraints of an agency’s time or budget is not always feasible, and the technical, financial, 
and accounting information to carry out such an analysis may simply be unavailable.  
RPE multipliers provide, at an aggregate level, the relative shares of revenues 
(Revenue = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs + Net Income) to direct manufacturing costs.  Using 
RPE multipliers implicitly assumes that incremental changes in direct manufacturing costs 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-12 
 
produce common incremental changes in all indirect cost contributors as well as net income.  
A concern in using the RPE multiplier in cost analysis for new technologies added in response 
to regulatory requirements is that the indirect costs of vehicle modifications are not likely to 
be the same for different technologies.  For example, less complex technologies could require 
fewer R&D efforts or less warranty coverage than more complex technologies.  In addition, 
some simple technological adjustments may, for example, have no effect on the number of 
corporate personnel and the indirect costs attributable to those personnel.  The use of RPEs, 
with their assumption that all technologies have the same proportion of indirect costs, is likely 
to overestimate the costs of less complex technologies and underestimate the costs of more 
complex technologies. 
To address this concern, the agencies have developed modified multipliers.  These 
multipliers are referred to as indirect cost multipliers (ICMs).  In contrast to RPE multipliers, 
ICMs assign unique incremental changes to each indirect cost contributor  
 ICM = (direct cost + adjusted indirect cost + profit)/(direct cost) 
Developing the ICMs from the RPE multipliers requires developing adjustment factors 
based on the complexity of the technology and the time frame under consideration.  This 
methodology was used in the cost estimation for the MYs 2012-2016 final rule.  The ICMs 
were developed in a peer-reviewed report from RTI International and were subsequently 
discussed in a peer-reviewed journal article.14  Note that the cost of capital (reflected in profit) 
is included because of the assumption implicit in ICMs (and RPEs) that capital costs are 
proportional to direct costs, and businesses need to be able to earn returns on their 
investments.  The capital costs are those associated with the incremental costs of the new 
technologies. 
As noted above, for the analysis supporting this proposed rulemaking, the agencies are 
again using the ICM approach but have made some changes to both the ICM factors and to 
the method of applying those factors to arrive at a final cost estimate.  The first of these 
changes was done in response to continued thinking among the EPA-NHTSA team about how 
past ICMs have been developed and what are the most appropriate data sources to rely upon 
in determining the appropriate ICMs.  The second change has been done both due to staff 
concerns and public feedback suggesting that the agencies were inappropriately applying 
learning effects to indirect costs via the multiplicative approach to applying the ICMs.  
Regarding the first change – to the ICM factors themselves – a little background must 
first be provided.  In the original work done under contract to EPA by RTI International,15 
EPA experts had undertaken a consensus approach to determining the impact of specific 
technology changes on the indirect costs of a company.  Subsequent to that effort, EPA 
experts conducted a blind survey to make this determination on a different set of technology 
changes.  This subsequent effort, referred to by EPA as a modified-Delphi approach, resulted 
in slightly different ICM determinations.  This effort is detailed in a memorandum contained 
in the docket for this rule.16  Upon completing this effort, the EPA team determined that the 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-13 
 
original RTI values should be averaged with the modified-Delphi values to arrive at the final 
ICMs for low and medium complexity technologies and that the original RTI values would be 
used for high complexity level 1 while the modified-Delphi values would be used for high 
complexity level 2.  These final ICMs as described were used in the MYs 2012-2016 light-
duty GHG/CAFE rulemaking.   
More recently, EPA and NHTSA  decided that the original light-duty RTI values, 
because of the technologies considered for low and medium complexity, should no longer be 
used and that we should rely solely on the modified-Delphi values for these complexity levels.  
The original light-duty RTI study used low rolling resistance tires as a low complexity 
technology example and a dual clutch transmission as a medium complexity technology.  
Upon further thought, the technologies considered for the modified Delphi values (passive 
aerodynamic improvements for low complexity and turbocharging with downsizing for 
medium complexity) were considered to better represent the example technologies.  As a 
result, the modified-Delphi values became the working ICMs for low and medium complexity 
rather than averaging those values with the original RTI report values.  NHTSA and EPA staff 
also re-examined the technology complexity categories that were assigned to each light-duty 
technology and modified these assignments to better reflect the technologies that are now 
used as proxies to determine each category’s ICM value.   
A secondary-level change was also made as part of this ICM recalculation to the light-
duty ICMs.  That change was to revise upward the RPE level reported in the original RTI 
report from an original value of 1.46 to 1.5 to reflect the long term average RPE.  The original 
RTI study was based on 2007 data.  However, an analysis of historical RPE data indicates 
that, although there is year to year variation, the average RPE has remained roughly 1.5.  
ICMs will be applied to future year’s data and therefore NHTSA and EPA staff believe that it 
would be appropriate to base ICMs on the historical average rather than a single year’s result.  
Therefore, ICMs in this proposed rulemaking were adjusted to reflect this average level.  As a 
result, the High 1 and High 2 ICMs have also changed.   
Table 3-1 shows both the ICM values used in the MYs 2012-2016 final rule and the 
new ICM values used for the analysis supporting these proposed rules.  Near term values 
account for differences in the levels of R&D, tooling, and other indirect costs that will be 
incurred.  Once the program has been fully implemented, some of the indirect costs will no 
longer be attributable to the standards and, as such, a lower ICM factor is applied to direct 
costs.

Institute, University of Michigan, July 2010 
The second change made to the ICMs has to do with the way in which they are 
applied.  To date, we have applied the ICMs, as done in any analysis that relied on RPEs, as a 
pure multiplicative factor.  This way, a direct manufacturing cost of, say, $100 would be 
multiplied by an ICM of 1.24 to arrive at a marked up technology cost of $124.  However, as 
learning effects (discussed below) are applied to the direct manufacturing cost, the indirect 
costs are also reduced accordingly.  Therefore, in year two the $100 direct manufacturing cost 
might reduce to $97, and the marked up cost would become $120 ($97 x 1.24).  As a result, 
indirect costs would be reduced from $24 to $20.  Given that indirect costs cover many things 
such as facility-related costs, electricity, etc., it is perhaps not appropriate to apply the ICM to 
the learned direct costs, at least not for those indirect cost elements unlikely to change with 
learning.  The EPA-NHTSA team believes that it is appropriate to allow only warranty costs 
to decrease with learning, since warranty costs are tied to direct manufacturing costs (since 
warranty typically involves replacement of actual parts which should be less costly with 
learning).  The remaining elements of the indirect costs should remain constant year-over-
year, at least until some of those indirect costs are no longer attributable to the rulemaking 
effort that imposed them (such as R&D). 
As a result, the ICM calculation has become more complex with the analysis supporting this proposal.  We 
must first establish the year in which the direct manufacturing costs are considered “valid.”  For example, 
a cost estimate might be considered valid today, or perhaps not until high volume production is reached—
which will not occur until MY 2015 or later.  That year is known as the base year for the estimated cost.  
That cost is the cost used to determine the “non-warranty” portion of the indirect costs.  For example, the 
non-warranty portion of the medium complexity ICM in the short-term is 0.343 (the warranty versus non-
warranty portions of the ICMs are shown in  
Table 3-2).  For the dual cam phasing (DCP) technology on an I4 engine we have 
estimated a direct manufacturing cost of $70 in MY 2015.  So the non-warranty portion of the 
indirect costs would be $24.01 ($70 x 0.343).  This value would be added to the learned direct 
manufacturing cost for each year through 2018, the last year of short term indirect costs.  
Beginning in 2019, when long-term indirect costs begin, the additive factor would become 
$18.13 ($70 x 0.259).  Additionally, the $70 cost in 2015 would become $67.90 in MY 2016 
due to learning ($70 x (1-3%)).  So, while the warranty portion of the indirect costs would be 
$3.15 ($70 x 0.045) in 2015, indirect costs would decrease to $3.06 ($67.90 x 0.045) in 2016 
as warranty costs decrease with learning.  The resultant indirect costs for the DCP-I4 
technology would be $27.16 ($24.01+$3.15) in MY 2015 and $27.07 ($24.01+$3.06) in 
MY2016, and so on for subsequent years.

There is some level of uncertainty surrounding both the ICM and RPE markup factors.  
The ICM estimates used in this proposal group all technologies into three broad categories 
and treat them as if individual technologies within each of the three categories (low, medium, 
and high complexity) will have exactly the same ratio of indirect costs to direct costs.  This 
simplification means it is likely that the direct cost for some technologies within a category 
will be higher and some lower than the estimate for the category in general. Additionally, the 
ICM estimates were developed using adjustment factors developed in two separate occasions: 
the first, a consensus process, was reported in the RTI report; the second, a modified Delphi 
method, was conducted separately and reported in an EPA memorandum.  Both these panels 
were composed of EPA staff members with previous background in the automobile industry; 
the memberships of the two panels overlapped but were not the same.  The panels evaluated 
each element of the industry’s RPE estimates and estimated the degree to which those 
elements would be expected to change in proportion to changes in direct manufacturing costs.  
The method and the estimates in the RTI report were peer reviewed by three industry experts 
and subsequently by reviewers for the International Journal of Production Economics.17  
However, the ICM estimates have not yet been validated through a direct accounting of actual 
indirect costs for individual technologies.  RPEs themselves are also inherently difficult to 
estimate because the accounting statements of manufacturers do not neatly categorize all cost 
elements as either direct or indirect costs.  Hence, each researcher developing an RPE 
estimate must apply a certain amount of judgment to the allocation of the costs.  Since 
empirical estimates of ICMs are ultimately derived from the same data used to measure RPEs, 
this affects both measures.  However, the value of RPE has not been measured for specific 
technologies, or for groups of specific technologies.  Thus applying a single average RPE to 
any given technology by definition overstates costs for very simple technologies, or 
understates them for advanced technologies.  
3.2.2.3 Stranded capital 
Because the production of automotive components is capital-intensive, it is possible 
for substantial capital investments in manufacturing equipment and facilities to become 
“stranded” (where their value is lost, or diminished).  This would occur when the capital is 
rendered useless (or less useful) by some factor that forces a major change in vehicle design, 
plant operations, or manufacturer’s product mix, such as a shift in consumer demand for 
certain vehicle types.  It can also be caused by new standards that phase-in at a rate too rapid 
to accommodate planned replacement or redisposition of existing capital to other activities.  
The lost value of capital equipment is then amortized in some way over production of the new 
technology components. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-16 
 
It is difficult to quantify accurately any capital stranding associated with new 
technology phase-ins under the proposed standards because of the iterative dynamic involved 
– that is, the new technology phase-in rate strongly affects the potential for additional cost due 
to stranded capital, but that additional cost in turn affects the degree and rate of phase-in for 
the same or other individual competing technologies.  In addition, such an analysis is very 
company-, factory-, and manufacturing process-specific, particularly in regard to finding 
alternative uses for equipment and facilities.  Nevertheless, in order to account for the 
possibility of stranded capital costs, the agencies asked FEV to perform an analysis, using 
conservative assumptions, of the potential stranded capital costs associated with rapid phase-
in of technologies due to new standards, using data from FEV’s primary teardown-based cost 
analyses.18  
The assumptions made in FEV’s stranded capital analysis with potential for major 
impacts on results are: 
• All manufacturing equipment was bought brand new when the old technology 
started production (no carryover of equipment used to make the previous 
components that the old technology itself replaced). 
• 10-year normal production runs:  Manufacturing equipment used to make old 
technology components is straight-line depreciated over a 10-year life. 
• Factory managers do not optimize capital equipment phase-outs (that is, they are 
assumed to routinely repair and replace equipment without regard to whether or 
not it will soon be scrapped due to adoption of new vehicle technology). 
• Estimated stranded capital is amortized over 5 years of annual production at 
450,000 units (of the new technology components).  This annual production is 
identical to that assumed in FEV’s primary teardown-based cost analyses. The 5-
year recovery period is chosen to help ensure a conservative analysis; the actual 
recovery would of course vary greatly with market conditions. 
FEV assembled a team of manufacturing experts to perform the analysis, using a 
methodology with the following key steps for each vehicle technology scenario: 
1) Identify all of the old technology components that are no longer used or that are 
modified in the new technology vehicles (from the comparison bills of materials 
developed in the primary teardown-based analyses). 
2) For each of these components identify the manufacturing equipment and tooling 
needed to make it. 
3) Estimate the new-purchase $ value of each item identified in step 2. 
4) Assign an “Investment Category” to each equipment item identified in step 2, 
based on an assessment by FEV’s experts of recoverable value: 
• Flexible: Equipment can be used to manufacture new technology or other parts 
(0% stranded) 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-17 
 
• Re-Useable: Equipment can be used in alternative industries, sold at 50% of its 
remaining value (50% stranded) 
• Semi-Dedicated: Estimate that 50% of equipment is flexible (50% stranded) 
• Dedicated: Custom manufacturing equipment (100% stranded) 
5) Assign an “Investment Category” to each tooling item identified in step 2, based 
on an assessment by FEV’s experts of recoverable value: 
• Flexible: Can be used for manufacturing new technology parts (0% stranded) 
• Perishable: Frequent replacement of tooling (0% stranded) 
• Semi-Dedicated Tooling: Estimate that 50% of tooling is dedicated (50% 
stranded) 
• Dedicated: Commodity-specific (100% stranded) 
6) Multiply the % stranding values from steps 4 and 5 by the $ values from step 3. 
7) Multiply the results in step 6 by 70%, 50%, and 20% for 3-, 5-, and 8-year 
stranding scenarios, respectively.  That is, an old technology, for which production 
is truncated prematurely after only 8 years, will experience the stranding of 20% 
(the last 2 years of its 10-year normal production run) of its associated remaining 
capital value. 
8) Sum the results in step 7 to obtain overall stranded capital costs. 
9) Divide the results in step 8 by 2,250,000 (5 years x 450,000 units/year) to obtain 
$/vehicle values, applicable to new technology vehicles for the 1st 5 years of their 
production due to the assumed 5-year recovery period. 
The stranded capital analysis was performed for three transmission technology 
scenarios, two engine technology scenarios, and one hybrid technology scenario, as shown in 
Table 3-3.  The methodology used by EPA in applying these results to the technology costs is 
described in Chapter 3 of EPA’s draft RIA.  The methodology used by NHTSA in applying 
these results to the technology costs is described in NHTSA’s preliminary RIA section V.

3.2.3 Cost reduction through manufacturer learning 
For this proposal, we have not changed our estimates of learning and how learning 
will impact costs going forward from what was employed in the analysis for the MYs 2012-
2016 light-duty vehicle rule.  However, we have updated our terminology in an effort to 
clarify that we consider there to be one learning effect—learning by doing—which results in 
cost reductions occurring with every doubling of production.e  In the past, we have referred to 
volume-based and time-based learning.  Our terms were meant only to denote where on the 
volume learning curve a certain technology was—“volume-based learning” meant the steep 
portion of the curve where learning effects are greatest, while “time-based learning” meant 
the flatter portion of the curve where learning effects are less pronounced.  Unfortunately, our 
terminology led some to believe that we were implementing two completely different types of 
learning—one based on volume of production and the other based on time in production.  Our 
new terminology—steep portion of the curve and flat portion of curve—is simply meant to 
make more clear that there is one learning curve and some technologies can be considered to 
be on the steep portion while others are well into the flatter portion of the curve.  These two 
portions of the volume learning curve are shown in Figure 3-1. 
                                                 
e
 Note that this new terminology was described in the recent heavy-duty GHG final rule (see 76 FR 57320).  The 
learning approach used in this analysis is entirely consistent with that used and described for that analysis.

Figure 3-1 Steep & Flat Portions of the Volume Learning Curve 
For some of the technologies considered in this analysis, manufacturer learning effects 
would be expected to play a role in the actual end costs.  The “learning curve” or “experience 
curve” describes the reduction in unit production costs as a function of accumulated 
production volume.  In theory, the cost behavior it describes applies to cumulative production 
volume measured at the level of an individual manufacturer, although it is often assumed—as 
both agencies have done in past regulatory analyses—to apply at the industry-wide level, 
particularly in industries like the light duty vehicle production industry that utilize many 
common technologies and component supply sources.   Both agencies believe there are indeed 
many factors that cause costs to decrease over time.  Research in the costs of manufacturing 
has consistently shown that, as manufacturers gain experience in production, they are able to 
apply innovations to simplify machining and assembly operations, use lower cost materials, 
and reduce the number or complexity of component parts.  All of these factors allow 
manufacturers to lower the per-unit cost of production.  We refer to this phenomenon as the 
manufacturing learning curve.   
NHTSA and EPA included a detailed description of the learning effect in the MYs 
2012-2016 light-duty rule and the more recent heavy-duty rule.19  Most studies of the effect of 
experience or learning on production costs appear to assume that cost reductions begin only 
after some initial volume threshold has been reached, but not all of these studies specify this 
threshold volume.  The rate at which costs decline beyond the initial threshold is usually

expressed as the percent reduction in average unit cost that results from each successive 
doubling of cumulative production volume, sometimes referred to as the learning rate.  Many 
estimates of experience curves do not specify a cumulative production volume beyond which 
cost reductions would no longer occur, instead depending on the asymptotic behavior of the 
effect for learning rates below 100 percent to establish a floor on costs.   
In past rulemaking analyses, as noted above, both agencies have used a learning curve 
algorithm that applied a learning factor of 20 percent for each doubling of production volume.   
NHTSA has used this approach in analyses supporting recent CAFE rules.  In its analyses, 
EPA has simplified the approach by using an “every two years” based learning progression 
rather than a pure production volume progression (i.e., after two years of production it was 
assumed that production volumes would have doubled and, therefore, costs would be reduced 
by 20 percent).f    
In the MYs 2012-2016 light-duty rule and the recent heavy-duty GHG final rule, the 
agencies employed an additional learning algorithm to reflect the volume-based learning cost 
reductions that occur further along on the learning curve.  This additional learning algorithm 
was termed “time-based” learning in the 2012-2016 rule simply as a means of distinguishing 
this algorithm from the volume-based algorithm mentioned above, although both of the 
algorithms reflect the volume-based learning curve supported in the literature.   As described 
above, we are now referring to this learning algorithm as the “flat portion” of the learning 
curve.  This way, we maintain the clarity that all learning is, in fact, volume-based learning, 
and that the level of cost reductions depend only on where on the learning curve a 
technology’s learning progression is.  We distinguish the flat portion of the curve from the 
steep portion of the curve to indicate the level of learning taking place in the years following 
implementation of the technology (see Figure 3-1).  The agencies have applied learning 
effects on the steep portion of the learning curve for those technologies considered to be 
newer technologies likely to experience rapid cost reductions through manufacturer learning, 
and learning effects on the flat portion learning curve for those technologies considered to be 
more mature technologies likely to experience only minor cost reductions through 
manufacturer learning.  As noted above, the steep portion learning algorithm results in 20 
                                                 
f
 To clarify, EPA has simplified the steep portion of the volume learning curve by assuming that production 
volumes of a given technology will have doubled within two years time.  This has been done largely to allow for 
a presentation of estimated costs during the years of implementation, without the need to conduct a feedback 
loop that ensures that production volumes have indeed doubled.  If we were to attempt such a feedback loop, we 
would need to estimate first year costs, feed those into OMEGA, review the resultant technology penetration rate 
and volume increase, calculate the learned costs, feed those into OMEGA (since lower costs would result in 
higher penetration rates, review the resultant technology penetration rate and volume increase, etc., until an 
equilibrium was reached.  To do this for all of the technologies considered in our analysis is simply not feasible.  
Instead, we have estimated the effects of learning on costs, fed those costs into OMEGA, and reviewed the 
resultant penetration rates.  The assumption that volumes have doubled after two years is based solely on the 
assumption that year two sales are of equal or greater number than year one sales and, therefore, have resulted in 
a doubling of production.  This could be done on a daily basis, a monthly basis, or, as we have done, a yearly 
basis.

percent lower costs after two full years of implementation (i.e., the MY 2016 costs would be 
20 percent lower than the MYs 2014 and 2015 costs).  Once two steep portion learning steps 
have occurred, flat portion learning at 3 percent per year becomes effective for 5 years.  
Beyond 5 years of learning at 3 percent per year, 5 years of learning at 2 percent per year, 
then 5 at 1 percent per year become effective.     
Learning effects are applied to most but not all technologies because some of the 
expected technologies are already used rather widely in the industry and we therefore assume 
that learning impacts have already occurred.  The steep portion learning algorithm was 
applied for only a handful of technologies that are considered to be new or emerging 
technologies.  Most technologies have been considered to be more established given their 
current use in the fleet and, hence, the lower flat portion learning algorithm has been applied.  
The learning algorithms applied to each technology and the applicable timeframes are 
summarized in Table 3-4.

 Note that the steep learning effects have for EV and PHEV battery packs and charger components have been

The learning effects discussed here impact the technology costs in that those 
technology costs for which learning effects are considered applicable are changing throughout 
the period of implementation and the period following implementation.  For example, some of 
the technology costs considered in this analysis are taken from the MY 2012-2016 light-duty 
rule.  Many of the costs in the 2012-2016 light-duty rule were considered “applicable” for the 
2012 model year.  If flat-portion learning were applied to those technologies, the 2013 cost 
would be 3 percent lower than the 2012 cost, and the 2014 model year cost 3 percent lower 
than the 2013 cost, etc.  As a result, the 2017-2025 costs for a given technology used in this 
analysis reflect those years of flat learning and would not be identical to the 2012 model year 
cost for that same technology presented in the 2012-2016 light-duty rule. 
Because of the nature of battery pack development (i.e., we are arguably still in the 
research phase for the types of batteries considered in this proposal, and cost reduction 
through manufacturer-based learning has only just begun, if it has begun at all), the agencies 
have carried the learning curve through five steep based learning steps although at a 
somewhat slower pace than every two years.  This has been done in an effort to maintain the 
shape of a traditional learning curve.  This curve was developed by using the ANL BatPaC 
model costs as direct manufacturing costs applicable in the 2025 MY.  We have then 
unlearned those costs back to 2012 using the curve shown in Figure 3-2.  This is the same 
curve used in the 2010 TAR (see 2010 TAR at page B-22).   This allows the agencies to 
estimate costs in MYs 2017 through 2025, as well as those costs in each year back to MY 
2012, if desired.  As noted, this learning curve consists of 5 full learning steps on the steep 
portion of the learning curve, each of which results in costs being reduced 20 percent relative 
to the prior step.  These learning steps are shown occurring every two years beginning in 2012 
until 2020, at which time a 5 year gap is imposed until 2025 when the fifth steep learning step 
occurs.  Beyond 2025, learning on the flat portion of the curve begins at 3 percent per year 
cost reductions.  The smooth line shows a logarithmic curve fit applied to the learning curve 
as the agencies’ cost model would apply learning.

3.3 How did the agencies determine effectiveness of each of these technologies? 
The agencies determined the effectiveness of each individual technology with a 
process similar to the one used for the 2012-2016 light duty vehicle GHG and CAFE 
standards.  The individual effectiveness of several technologies discussed in this rule that 
were present in the earlier rule were left largely unchanged while others were updated.  EPA

and NHTSA reviewed recent confidential manufacturer estimates of technology effectiveness 
and found them to be generally consistent with our estimates.  Additionally, EPA used vehicle 
simulation modeling to gain further insight on existing and new technologies for this 
rulemaking.  EPA conducted a vehicle simulation project (described in 3.3.1) that included a 
majority of the proposed technologies, the results of which: 
• informed existing individual technology effectiveness values, 
• provided data for newly introduced technologies, and  
• most importantly, provided an interactive data source with which to update and 
calibrate the new LP model 
The lumped parameter model then served as the primary tool in evaluating the 
individual technology effectiveness estimates, the combined effectiveness of groups of 
technologies (or packages) and synergy factors, as described in 3.3.2.  The effectiveness 
values, in conjunction with costs, were then applied to vehicles across the fleet for use in the 
Agencies’ respective compliance models. 
3.3.1 Vehicle simulation modeling    
3.3.1.1 Background 
For regulatory purposes, the fuel economy of any given vehicle is determined by 
placing the vehicle on a chassis dynamometer (akin to a large treadmill that puts the vehicle’s 
wheels in contact with one or more rollers, rather than with a belt stretched between rollers) in 
a controlled environment, driving the vehicle over a specific driving cycle (in which driving 
speed is specified for each second of operation), measuring the amount of carbon dioxide 
emitted from the vehicle’s tailpipe, and calculating fuel consumption based on the density and 
carbon content of the fuel. 
One means of determining the effectiveness of a given technology as applied to a 
given vehicle model would be to measure the vehicle’s fuel economy on a chassis 
dynamometer, install the new technology, and then re-measure the vehicle’s fuel economy.  
However, most technologies cannot simply be “swapped out,” and even for those that can, 
simply doing so without additional engineering work may change other vehicle characteristics 
(e.g., ride, handling, performance, etc.), producing an “apples to oranges” comparison. 
Some technologies can also be more narrowly characterized through bench or engine 
dynamometer (i.e., in which the engine drives a generator that is, in turn, used to apply a 
controlled load to the engine) testing.  For example, engine dynamometer testing could be 
used to evaluate the brake-specific fuel consumption (e.g., grams per kilowatt-hour) of a 
given engine before and after replacing the engine oil with a less viscous oil.  However, such 
testing does not provide a direct measure of overall vehicle fuel economy or changes in 
overall vehicle fuel economy. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-25 
 
For a vehicle that does not yet exist, as in the agencies’ analyses of CAFE and GHG 
standards applicable to future model years, even physical testing can provide only an estimate 
of the vehicle’s eventual fuel economy.  Among the alternatives to physical testing, 
automotive engineers involved in vehicle design make use of computer-based analysis tools, 
including a powerful class of tools commonly referred to as “full vehicle simulation.”  Given 
highly detailed inputs regarding vehicle engineering characteristics, full vehicle simulation 
provides a means of estimating vehicle fuel consumption over a given drive cycle, based on 
the explicit representation of the physical laws governing vehicle propulsion and dynamics.  
Some vehicle simulation tools also incorporate combustion simulation tools that represent the 
combustion cycle in terms of governing physical and chemical processes.  Although these 
tools are computationally intensive and required a great deal of input data, they provide 
engineers involved in vehicle development and design with an alternative that can be 
considerably faster and less expensive than physical experimentation and testing. 
Properly executed, methods such as physical testing and full vehicle simulation can 
provide reasonably (though not absolutely) certain estimates of the vehicle fuel economy of 
specific vehicles to be produced in the future.  However, when analyzing potential CAFE and 
GHG standards, the agencies are not actually designing specific vehicles.  The agencies are 
considering implications of new standards that will apply to the average performance of 
manufacturers’ entire production lines.  For this type of analysis, precision in the estimation 
of the fuel economy of individual vehicle models is not essential; although it is important that 
the agency avoid systematic upward or downward bias, uncertainty at the level of individual 
models is mitigated by the fact that compliance with CAFE and GHG standards is based on 
average fleet performance. 
DOT’s CAFE model and EPA’s OMEGA are not full vehicle simulation models.  
Both models use higher-level estimates of the efficacy of different technologies or technology 
packages.  Both models apply methods to avoid potential double-counting of efficacy 
addressing specific energy loss mechanisms (e.g., pumping losses), and for this NPRM, both 
agencies applied estimates using EPA’s lumped parameter model, which was updated using 
results of full vehicle simulation performed by Ricardo, PLC.  Although full vehicle 
simulation could, in principle, be fully integrated into the agencies’ model-by-model analyses 
of the entire fleet to be projected to be produced in future model years, this level of 
integration would be infeasible considering the size and complexity of the fleet.  Also, 
considering the forward-looking nature of the agencies’ analyses, and the amount of 
information required to perform full vehicle simulation, this level of integration would 
involve misleadingly precise estimates of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. 
Still, while the agencies have used results of full vehicle simulation to inform the 
development of model inputs for performing fleet-level analysis, information from other 
sources (e.g., vehicle testing) could be considered when developing such model inputs.  
Before performing analysis to support the evaluation and finalization of post-2016 CAFE and 
GHG standards, the agencies will revisit estimates of technology efficacy for use DOT’s 
CAFE model and EPA’s OMEGA model, and invite comment on the use of information from 
full vehicle simulation and other sources.  Related, DOT has, as discussed above, contracted 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-26 
 
with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to provide additional full vehicle simulation 
modeling support for this MYs 2017-2025 rulemaking, and anticipates that results will be 
available for use in developing inputs for the final rule. 
3.3.1.2 2011 Ricardo Simulation Study 
For this rule EPA built upon its 2008 vehicle simulation project20 used to support the 
2012-2016 light duty vehicle GHG and CAFE standards (reference).  As in the initial project, 
the technical work was conducted by the global engineering consulting firm, Ricardo, Inc. 
(under subcontract to SRA Corporation), using its MSC.EASY5 dynamic vehicle simulation 
model.  This section is intended to supplement the main report which (has been) recently 
published and peer-reviewed1.  While this project represents a new round of full-scale vehicle 
simulation of advanced technologies, the scope has also been expanded in several ways to 
broaden the range of vehicle classes and technologies considered, consistent with a longer-
term outlook through model years 2017-2025.  The expanded scope also includes a new 
analytical tool (complex systems analysis tool) to assist in interpolating the response surface 
modeling (RSM) data and visualizing technology effectiveness.  This tool was especially 
useful in isolating effectiveness trends during development of the updated Lumped Parameter 
model.  
The agencies try to use publicly available information as the basis for technical 
assessments whenever possible.  Because this rulemaking extends to MY 2025, and includes 
some technologies that are not currently in production and for which there is limited 
information available in the literature, some of the technology inputs used to estimate 
effectiveness are based on confidential business information.  This includes the inputs related 
to the technologies listed below which were based on confidential business information 
belonging to Ricardo, Inc, and  their expert judgment that contributed to projecting how these 
technologies might improve in the future.  The agencies have also considered information 
which is in the public domain, in particular for turbo-charged, downsized GDI engines as 
discussed in Section 3.4.1.8, as well as confidential information on engine and transmission 
technologies from automotive suppliers which directionally was in line with the information 
considered by Ricardo. The agencies encourage commenters to submit technical information, 
preferably that may be released publicly, related to these technologies, particularly on their 
effectiveness and ability to be implemented in a way that maintains utility.  The agencies 
welcome data and information on the technologies individually or in combinations.

projected BSFC maps)Hybrid powertrain control strategies 
• Optimized transmission shift control strategies 
• Transmission efficiency improvement.

3.3.1.2.1 More Vehicle Classes 
Two additional vehicle classes were considered, for a total of seven classes:  a small 
car (subcompact) and a medium/heavy duty truck class.  The inclusion of the small car class 
increased the fidelity of the results by capturing engineering differences unique to the smallest 
vehicles in the market.  The inclusion of the medium/heavy duty truck was meant primarily to 
support EPA’s analysis for the Heavy Duty GHG Rule21.  It is worth noting that these vehicle 
classes are for simulation purposes only and are not be confused with regulatory classes or 
NHTSA’s technology subclasses.  
3.3.1.2.2 More engine and vehicle technologies 
The original 2008 project modeled several engine and transmission technologies that 
were expected to become commercially available within the 2012-2016 time frame.  These 
technologies included advanced valvetrain technologies (such as variable valve timing and 
lift, cylinder deactivation), turbocharged and downsized engines, as well as 6 speed automatic 
transmissions, CVTsg and dual-clutch transmissions.  The current project built on top of this 
effort with the inclusion of several new engine and vehicle technologies.  Highlighted 
examples included: 
• Advanced, highly downsized, high BMEPh turbocharged engines 
• High efficiency transmissions with 8 speeds and optimized shift strategies to 
maximize vehicle system efficiency 
• Atkinson-cycle engines for hybrids 
• Stop-start (or idle-off) technology 
A discussion of these technologies is included Section 3.3.3, and also in the 2011 
vehicle simulation report1.   
3.3.1.2.3 Includes hybrid architectures 
For the first time, this new work includes modeling of hybrid architectures for all 
vehicle classes.  Two main classes of hybrids were considered: 
• Input powersplit hybrids.  Examples of input powersplits in the market today 
include the Ford Fusion HEV and the Toyota Prius.   
• P2 hybrids.  An example of the P2 hybrid is the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid.

 BMEP refers to brake mean effective pressure, a common engineering metric which describes the specific 
torque of an engine, as a way of comparing engines of different sizes.  It is usually expressed in units of bar, or 
kPa,  Current naturally aspirated production engines typically average 10-12 bar BMEP, while modern 
turbocharged engines are now exceeding 20 bar BMEP with regularity.  Simply put, a 20 bar BMEP 
turbocharged engine will provide twice the torque of an equivalent sized engine that achieves 10 bar BMEP. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

While input powersplit hybrids remain a very likely hybrid architecture choice for 
some manufacturers, the agencies focused solely on P2 hybrids compared to powersplit 
hybrids due to their apparent cost-effectiveness advantage in future years. 
Ricardo proprietary methodology was used to develop the control strategies were 
developed for each architecture, the details of which can be found in section 6.8 of the 2011 
project report1.   
 
3.3.1.2.4 Complex systems tool for data analysis 
In the original 2008 project, EPA staff selected unique technology packages, based on 
engineering judgment, to cover a representative subset of possible vehicle options ending in 
MY 2016.  The expanded project time horizon (through MY 2025) and increased complexity 
of potential vehicle technology interactions (including hybrids) made package selection much 
more difficult.  To account for unforeseen results and trends which might exist, EPA and 
Ricardo adopted a complex systems approach, which is a rigorous computational strategy 
designed to mathematically account for multiple input variables and determine the 
significance of each (the complex systems approach is described in further detail in the 2011 
Ricardo report).  As a comparison, in the 2008 study, twenty-six unique technology packages 
spanning five vehicle classes were selected by EPA staff and then modeled.  For this project a 
set of core technology packages were chosen for each vehicle class, constituting a total of 107 
unique vehicle packages (“nominal runs”), which are shown as Table 3-3 and Table 3-6 in 
3.3.1.2.8. A neural network Complex Systems approach to design of experiments (DOE) was 
then applied to generate a set of response surface models (RSM), in which several input 
parameters were varied independently over a specified range to identify the complex 
relationship between these inputs and the vehicle performance.  Using these methods, the 
vehicle simulation was run for a set of discrete input variables chosen based on a full factorial 
analysis, using a computationally efficient algorithm to select each input variable within the 
design space, allowing for subsequent statistical regression of the output variables.  This 
approach resulted in an average of approximately two thousand independent simulation runs 
for each of the 100+ vehicle packages, the outputs of which were interpolated in the data 
analysis tool developed for this modeling activity.  For each of these nominal and DOE runs 
Ricardo provided detailed 10-hz output data csv files for reviewi. 
An interactive Complex Systems analysis and visualization tool was developed to 
interpret the vast arrays of RSM data generated as part of the project.  It was created to sample 
a selected portion of the design space populated using the DOE approach described above, 
and then interpret the RSM data set in a form that could be used to calibrate the lumped

more detail on the use of the RSM tool, refer to the 2011 Ricardo report1. 
3.3.1.2.5 Process 
The core technical work, completed in February 2011, consisted of the following 
steps: 
• Definition of project scope 
• Selection of vehicle classes and baseline vehicle characteristics 
• Selection of vehicle architectures and individual technologies 
• Selection of swept variables for use in the RSM matrix 
• Selection of vehicle performance metrics  
• Review and revision of the input assumptions and modeling process 
• Build and run the baseline EASY5 vehicle models 
• Review of baseline runs and checking for errors 
• Build and run the nominal technology package EASY5 vehicle models 
• Review results and debug 
• Run complete DOE matrix for each technology package 
• Incorporation of DOE results into RSM tool 
 
3.3.1.2.6 Definition of project scope 
At project initiation, an advisory committee was formed and led by EPA to help guide 
the analysis.  The advisory committee consisted of technical experts from CARB and The 
ICCT, the latter of which co-founded the project.  A complete list of advisory committee 
members is found in the vehicle simulation project report1. The committee agreed upon the 
underlying ground rules, reviewed modeling assumptions and identified the desired vehicle 
architectures and selected technologies for review.  The boundaries for the project are 
highlighted (quoted) below: 
• A total of seven vehicle classes will be included: small car, standard car, large car, 
small and large MPVs (multi-purpose vehicles), truck and HD truck 
• LDV technologies must have the potential to be commercially deployed in the 
2020-2025 timeframe 
• Vehicle sizes (footprint and interior space) for each class will be largely 
unchanged from 2010 to 2020-2025  
• Hybrid vehicles will use an advanced hybrid control strategy, focusing on battery 
state-of-charge management, but will not compromise vehicle drivability 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-30 
 
• Vehicles will use fuels equivalent to 87 octane pump gasoline and 40 cetane pump 
diesel 
• It is assumed that 2020-2025 vehicles will meet future California LEV III 
requirements for criteria pollutants, approximately equivalent to current SULEV II 
(or EPA Tier 2 Bin 2) emissions levels 
• Changes in vehicle road loads including mass, aerodynamic drag, and rolling 
resistance, will not be accounted for in any of the modeled technologies.  Instead, 
changes in vehicle road loads may be addressed through user-specified continuous 
input variables in the Complex Systems tool. 
The committee also decided that the following technologies fell outside the scope of 
the project, either due to project resource limitations, lack of sufficient input data, or a low 
potential to be commercially deployed in the timeframe considered: 
• Charge-depleting powertrains (e.g. plug-in hybrids and electric range-extended 
vehicles) and electric vehicles 
• Fuel cell-powered vehicles 
• Non-reciprocating internal combustion engines or external combustion engines 
• Manual transmissions and single-clutch automated manual transmissions (AMTs) 
• Kinetic energy recovery systems other than battery systems 
• Intelligent vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure optimization 
technology 
• Bottoming cycles (such as organic Rankine cycles) for energy recovery 
• Vehicle safety systems or structures will not be explicitly modeled for vehicles, as 
it is beyond the scope of the study 
The committee also selected a set of swept input variables (vehicle parameters) which 
were considered most important to vehicle fuel economy and performance (swept variables 
are continuously variable input values that affect vehicle output efficiency in a smooth 
function for the response surface model).  These variables consisted of engine displacement, 
final drive ratio, electric drive motor size (for hybrids), as well as road load factors (vehicle 
mass, aerodynamic drag, and rolling resistance).  All of these input variables were 
randomized in each vehicle design of experiment matrix and then incorporated into the post-
processing RSM data visualization tool.

3.3.1.2.7 Selection of vehicle classes and baseline vehicle characteristics 
In order to estimate both technology costs and CO2 reduction estimates, it is necessary 
to describe the baseline vehicle characteristics as the basis from which comparisons may be 
drawn.  In the 2012-2016 light-duty vehicle rule the vehicle baseline was defined as having a 
naturally aspirated gasoline engine with a port-fuel injection system, two intake and two 
exhaust valves and fixed valve timing and lift; the baseline transmission was a conventional 
4-speed automatic, with no hybrid systems.  These vehicles are referred to throughout this 
section as the 2008 baselines.  For the present study, EPA and Ricardo elected to include a set 
of 2010 “baseline” technology vehicles, which reflect MY2010 trends in engine and vehicle 
technology as well as some technologies that are expected to be widespread within a few 
years. It is important to note that the 2010 baseline vehicles in the Ricardo study do not reflect 
the technology content of the baseline fleet vehicles used by each agency in their respective 
compliance modeling.  The Ricardo 2010 baseline vehicles are only used in the analysis 
required to establish effectiveness and synergies in the lumped parameter model. The 2010 
baseline vehicles all include an engine with dual overhead camshaft and dual-independent 
intake/exhaust valve timing, a six-speed automatic transmission, 12-volt idle off (stop-start) 
functionality and an alternator with partial energy regeneration capability.  There is no change 
in the engine displacement or vehicle road load coefficients between the 2008 baseline and 
the 2010 baseline vehicles.  For a table showing the 2010 baseline vehicle characteristics refer 
to Appendix 3 of the 2011 Ricardo report1. 
In the Ricardo study, seven vehicle classes were selected for the analysis, in order to 
more fully represent the broad groupings of a wide variety of products offered in the US 
passenger car and light-duty truck market.  The seven vehicle categories chosen were as 
follows: 
• Small car: a subcompact car typically powered by a small 4 cylinder engine. 
• Standard car:  a midsize car typically powered by a small 6 cylinder engine. 
• Large car: a large passenger car typically powered by a large 6 cylinder engine. 
• Small MPV: a small multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) or “crossover” vehicle typically 
powered by a 4 cylinder engine 
• Large MPV:  a minivan or large MPV or “crossover” unibody constructed vehicle 
with a large frontal area, typically powered by a 6 cylinder engine, capable of carrying 
~ 6 or more passengers. 
• Large truck (1/2 ton):  large sports-utility vehicles and large pickup trucks, typically a 
ladder-on-frame construction, and typically powered by an 8 cylinder engine. 
• Class 2b/3 truck (3/4 ton): a large pickup truck (although with a GVW no greater than 
8.500 pounds) with a heavier frame intended to provide additional utility (a.k.a. 
“work” truck), typically powered by a larger 8 cylinder gasoline or diesel engine

3.3.1.2.8 Technology selection 
Ricardo presented the committee with an array of potential technologies that might 
become commercially viable and present in the light-duty market by 2025.  EPA and the 
Advisory Committee suggested additional other technologies, e.g. Atkinson engines for 
hybrids, fast engine warm-up strategies, etc, to consider in the selection process.  The 
complete set of potential technologies can be found in Appendix 2 of the 2011 Ricardo 
report1.   After further deliberation within the committee and by Ricardo, a subset of 
technologies considered most promising (from a technical feasibility and cost effectiveness 
standpoint) was selected by the committee and Ricardo for inclusion in the project test matrix.  
The technologies were distributed among four distinct vehicle architectures.  These 
architectures represented unique EASY5 model structures, and are listed below: 
• 2010 Baseline vehicles: intended to represent physical replicas of existing vehicle 
models, although some minor additional content was included (as described in 
Section 3.3.1.2.7)  
• Conventional stop-start: vehicles for the 2020-2025 timeframe that included 
advanced engines but did not incorporate an electric drive or braking energy 
recovery.  These vehicles all contained a 12 volt stop-start (or idle-off) capability, 
along with the following technologies further detailed in the 2011 Ricardo 
simulation studyj: 
o higher efficiency gearbox (2020 timeframe) 
o optimized shift strategy (best BSFC) 
o alternator regeneration (during braking) 
o high-efficiency alternator 
o advanced engine warmup technologies 
o engine friction reduction (+3.5% fuel consumption reduction over 
2008 baseline)  
• P2 hybrid: represent a class of hybrids in which the electric drive motor is coupled 
via a clutch directly to the transmission input shaft.  An existing vehicle in the 
market which most closely represents this architecture is the 2011 Hyundai Sonata 
Hybrid except that Ricardo recommended a P2 hybrid with a more efficient and 
cost effective dual clutch transmission in lieu of a planetary gear transmission.  
Additional examples of a P2 hybrid approach are the 2011 Volkswagen Touareg 
Hybrid, the 2011 Porsche S Hybrid, and the 2012 Infiniti M35 Hybrid.  Each of 
these are examples of “first generation” P2 systems, as compared to for example 
the powersplit hybrid systems offered by Ford, Toyota and or the IMA systems 
from Honda which are in their second, third or even fourth generation.   The 
                                                 
j
 The technologies included in all of the conventional stop-start packages were expected to be widespread by 
years 2017-2025.  Some “anytime technologies” such as aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance reduction were 
excluded from the nominal runs, but were incorporated in the complex systems portion of this project. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-33 
 
agencies are aware of some articles in trade journals, newspapers and other 
reviews that some first generation P2 hybrid vehicles with planetary gear 
transmissions have trade-offs in NVH and drivability – though these reviews do 
not cover all of the P2 systems available today, [and a number of reviews are very 
positive with respect to NVH and drivability].   For this analysis we are projecting 
that these issues with some first generation P2 systems can be addressed with no 
hardware cost increase or reduction in efficiency for future generations of P2 
systems developed for the 2017-2025 time frame.  The agencies seek comment on 
our assumptions in this regard, and we request comment on the applicability of 
DCTs to P2 hybrid applications, including any challenges associated with NVH or 
drivability.  Key technology assumptions included: 
o Lithium-ion battery 
o DCT transmission 
o Electric drive motor which provides, when combined with a less 
powerful engine, equivalent 0-60 performance to the baseline 
vehicle. 
o Engine displacement for the P2 hybrids were assumed to be 20% 
less than their conventional stop-start equivalents 
• Input powersplit hybrid: represent a class of hybrids with both an electric drive 
motor and a separate generator linked to a planetary gearset which effectively 
controls the overall gear ratio and distribution of tractive and electrical power.  
Example vehicles in the market include the Toyota Prius and the Ford Fusion 
hybrid.  Key technology assumptions are consistent with those for the P2 hybrid, 
with the exception of the power split device, which functions as a CVT-type 
transmission (as is the case in real world examples), and replaces the DCT 
transmission in the P2 design.  As stated previously while this technology was 
simulated it was not used in this NPRM analysis. 
Some architectures that seemed less appropriate for certain vehicle classes were 
omitted.  For example, in the Ricardo modeling of the medium/heavy duty truck (a Class 3 
vehicle with a GVWR >10,000 pounds, and thus not subject to the proposed standards in this 
rulemaking), no P2 or input powersplit hybrids were included.  Other technologies that did 
not seem reasonable for some vehicle classes (such as dry-clutch DCTs for Large MPVs and 
Trucks) were also excluded in the Ricardo simulations. 
In summary, 4 distinct vehicle architectures (including the baselines as an 
“architecture”), across 7 vehicle classes, and a number of engine and transmission 
combinations, represented the complete set of vehicle combinations.  The test matricesk can

 For each vehicle class, each advanced engine option is combined with each advanced transmission.  Baseline 
runs are not combined with other transmissions.

3.3.1.2.9 Selection of the swept input variables and their ranges 
The advisory committee agreed upon a set of continuous input variables to be swept in 
each vehicle package response surface.  These variables consisted of both powertrain 
characteristics (engine displacement, final drive ratio, and electric machine size for hybrids) 
and road load parameters (rolling resistance coefficient, aerodynamic drag force, and vehicle 
mass).  They were included in the DOE matrix for each vehicle architecture and powertrain 
configuration, and also serve as inputs to the complex systems visualization tool.  Table 3-7 
and Table 3-8 show the swept variables used (and their ranges) for the conventional stop-start 
and hybrid packages, respectively.  The ranges represent a percentage of the default value 
used in the nominal runs. 
 
 
Table 3-7:  Continuous input parameter sweep ranges for conventional stop-start vehicle 
 
 
 
Table 3-8:  Continuous input parameter sweep ranges for P2 and Powersplit hybrid vehicles 
 
 
The ranges were intended to include both the (unknown) optimal value for each 
technology case, but also wide enough to capture the range of values as they depart from the 
optimal value (in engineering parlance this is often referred to as finding the “knee” in the 
curve).

From these variables, a user can determine the sensitivity of each input variable to the 
vehicle fuel economy and performance.  For example, the effect of engine displacement on 
fuel economy was evaluated for several packages.  A more elaborate discussion of engine 
displacement effects is provided in Section 3.3.1.2.22.2. 
3.3.1.2.10 Selection of vehicle performance metrics 
For both effectiveness and cost estimates in these rulemakings, the agencies are 
assuming that vehicles will maintain utility (performance) comparable to the models in the 
baseline fleetl.  It was therefore important to maintain equivalent performance in the vehicle 
simulation modeling of future vehicle technology.  The resulting effectiveness estimates were 
in the context of equivalent performance, which carried over into the lumped parameter model 
and into the OMEGA and Volpe packages.   
Consistent with the 2008 simulation project, a set of vehicle (acceleration) 
performance metrics were selected by the advisory committee as a way of measuring 
“equivalent” vehicle performance.  When quantifying vehicle efficiency, it is important that 
certain other vehicle performance metrics are maintained, such that there are no other 
competing factors contributing or detracting from the vehicle efficiency.  Other vehicle 
characteristics that could impact or detract from vehicle efficiency (e.g., noise, vibration and 
harshness (NVH), drivability, durability, etc) were also considered during the generation of 
model inputs.  However, they were not analyzed explicitly, with the expectation that 
manufacturers would ultimately be able to meet vehicle refinement levels necessary for 
commercial acceptability of these new technologies.  These metrics, shown below in Table 
3-9, include time at full load to reach given speeds (0-10 mph, 0-30 mph, etc), maximum 
grade capability, and distance traveled at a given time (e.g., after 3 seconds).   Ultimately, the 
measure of equivalent performance is up to the reader or user of the Complex Systems tool.  
For EPA’s analysis baseline vehicle 0-30 mph and 0-60 mph acceleration times were used as 
a benchmark for equivalent performance for the advanced vehicle packages.  These estimated 
acceleration times are included in Table 3-11 through Table 3-18.  Detailed results that 
include all performance metrics including those for baseline vehicles are provided in the full 
2011 simulation report1.

 The only exception to this is a subset of hybrids explicitly listed as “non-towing” vehicles.  For further details

3.3.1.2.11 Review and revision of inputs 
For any system modeling in which the results extend beyond the bounds of known 
physical examples (and therefore direct data validation is impossible), it is imperative that the 
inputs be carefully constructed and thoroughly examined to minimize the potential for 
uncertainty-related errors.  Prior to coding of the models, Ricardo presented the following 
inputs for review and approval to EPA.  For each topic, EPA reviewed the material 
considering the rationale of Ricardo’s technical experts, the appropriateness of the inputs in 
relation to the assumed time horizon, the required emissions levels, and the known literature 
in the field today.  Listed below are several of the model inputs that were jointly reviewed by 
Ricardo and EPA: 
• Engine maps 
o Stoichiometric GDI turbo 
o Lean-burn GDI turbo 
o Cooled EGR turbo 
o Advanced diesel maps 
• Transmission efficiency tables (by gear) including torque converter efficiency 
• Engine warm-up strategy (cold start modifiers) 
• Alternator regeneration strategy 
• Transmission shift optimizer

• Engine friction reduction level 
• P2 hybrid controls 
• Input powersplit hybrid controls 
• Hybrid battery assumptions 
• Hybrid motor/generator efficiency maps 
EPA technical experts recommended several changes and iterated with Ricardo to 
establish a consensus set of inputs that were plausible and met the ground rules of the project. 
Some of these changes resulted in higher efficiencies, while others lowered efficiency.  
Highlighted below are a few key examples, starting with development of the engine maps: 
Engine maps carry perhaps the most significance of any of the sets of inputs needed to 
build vehicle simulation models.  They provide the brake specific fuel consumption, or BSFC 
(typically in g/kWh) for a given engine speed and load.  Typically these maps show an 
optimum speed and load band (or minimum BSFC “island”) that is the most efficient 
condition in which to operate the engine.  Ricardo generated engine maps for both the 
baseline vehicles (through benchmarking data) and proposed future engine maps for the 
various turbocharged and diesel engines.  Figure 3-3 shows an example engine map for a 
baseline vehicle.  It was constructed from EPA’s analysis of a baseline vehicle model run 
output file.  The contours represent lines of equivalent brake-specific fuel consumption.m 
3.3.1.2.11.1 Engine Technologies 
Ricardo developed the engines for the 2012-2025 timeframe in two ways. The first 
was to take current boosted SI research engines and project these would represent the level of 
performance which could be achieved by production engines in the 2020-2025 timeframe.  
The second method took current production Atkinson cycle SI and diesel engines and then 
included 2020-2025 timeframe technology improvements.  Both methods extrapolated current 
engine design and development trend to the 2020-2025 timeframe.  These current trends 
include engine friction reduction, improved fuel injection systems (e.g., spray guided for the 
SI, and higher injection pressures for the diesels), more advanced engine controls, and 
improved engine design for faster engine warm-up.  EPA reviewed the engine maps 
recommended by Ricardo and generally concurred they were appropriate for the study time 
frame based on EPA’s review of maps for current production engines and for research engines 
described in the literature. 
                                                 
m
 BSFC is measured in units of grams of fuel per kw-hour of energy and is an indicator of engine efficiency.  
Lower numbers indicate more efficient operating regions.  As in this case, an engine typically has an “island’ or 
region of best efficiency, in this case between 2000-3000 RPM and 150-180 Nm of torque.  This island becomes 
much larger with the advent of advanced technologies such as boosting and downsizing, as well as advanced 
valvetrain technologies.

3.3.1.2.11.2 Stoichiometric GDI 
The original stoichiometric GDI map that Ricardo proposed was based on laboratory 
data they had published in 2007, showing a peak brake-specific load of just under 20 bar 
BMEP and a minimum BSFC of approximately 235 g/kWhr, obtained using a compression 
ratio of 10.5:1.22  However, based on input from manufacturers and from other, more recent 
published data on developmental and research engines, EPA asked Ricardo to raise the load 
capability of the engine to approximately 27 bar BMEP.23,24,25,26 This allowed a greater degree 
of engine downsizing, which resulted in a downsizing of a 1.5 liter engine to a 0.74 liter 
engine for the nominal small car and a 5.4 liter to a 1.94 liter engine for the nominal large 
truck.  A compression ratio of 10.5:1 was maintained for improved efficiency.  At the same 
time, EPA asked that Ricardo eliminate the use of high-load enrichment, since water-cooled 
exhaust manifolds, in some cases integrated into the cylinder head, can be incorporated in 
next-generation designs to mitigate the need for fuel enrichment in lowering turbine inlet 
temperatures to 950 degrees C and thus avoid the added costs of high-temperature materials in 
the turbocharger.27,28  By reducing the need for fuel enrichment fuel consumption is reduced

over the more aggressive portions of the drive cycle, and PM emissions control at high load is 
improved. 
 
3.3.1.2.11.3 Lean-burn GDI 
Ricardo’s initial lean-burn GDI map was based on their single-cylinder research 
engine data, in which they operated in lean stratified charge mode at all speeds and loads, 
without due consideration of the potential limitations in lean exhaust NOx aftertreatment 
systems.  To address concerns in this area, EPA examined the boundaries of operation of lean-
NOx catalysts, assuming that manufacturers would adopt either LNTs or metal-zeolite urea 
SCR systems.  EPA therefore asked Ricardo to place a constraint on the maximum allowable 
catalyst space velocity (at high engine power) and exhaust gas temperature entering the 
catalyst (at high load, low engine speed conditions) to maintain catalyst efficiency at high 
load and to reduce thermal sintering of PGM under high-temperature, lean operating 
conditions.  More specifically, EPA recommended that engine operation switch away from 
lean operation (at air/fuel equivalence ratios up to approximately λ=1.5) to stoichiometric 
operation at turbine outlet temperatures above 600C, and at total exhaust flows corresponding 
to space velocities of 60,000/hour, assuming a catalyst volume of 2.5 times engine 
displacement.  This marginally diminished the engine brake thermal efficiency to 
stoichiometric GDI levels over this region of the map, but it provided more certainty that the 
engine would be able to adhere to the emissions levels as assumed in the project ground rules 
by the Advisory Committee.  Figure 3-4 shows the engine speed and load region EPA 
proposed as suitable for lean stratified operation.

3.3.1.2.11.4 Cooled EGR GDI 
EPA provided technical information from the literature which enabled Ricardo to 
assume a dual loop (both low pressure and high pressure EGR loops), cooled EGR system in 
addition to the stoichiometric turbocharged engine. The development of engine maps for this 
engine configuration was heavily informed by recently published data.26,27,28,29.  Cooled EGR 
allowed the use of “λ=1” operation at the same compression ratio with more aggressive spark 
timing at high load and reduced pumping losses at part load while maintaining acceptable 
turbocharger inlet temperatures.

3.3.1.2.11.5 Motor/generator and power inverter efficiency maps 
EPA recommended that Ricardo update the efficiency maps of the motor and 
generator (referred to as “electric machines” throughout the project), which they had proposed 
based on current best-in-class technology.  The baseline motor/generator+inverter efficiency 
map is taken from a 2007 Camry and shown in Figure 3-5 below. 
 
Figure 3-5:  2007 Camry Hybrid motor-inverter efficiency map (Burress, et al, 200830) 
EPA requested that Ricardo provide their assessment of where they believed 
efficiency improvements might be made, based upon trends in research and development for 
both electric machines and power electronics.  Ricardo and EPA generally agreed that these 
efficiency improvements were likely to be modest, particularly given the competitive 
pressures on manufacturers to reduce the cost of hybrid components.   However, EPA and 
Ricardo assumed that today’s best-in-class efficiency would likely be marginally improved 
through continuous incremental reductions in parasitic losses.  To account for this, EPA and 
Ricardo agreed to reduce the losses in the motor/generator by 10% (in other words, raising the 
efficiency of a 90% efficient motor to 91%) and to reduce the losses in the power electronics 
by 25% (mainly through continued improvements in inverter development and electronic 
control systems).   
3.3.1.2.11.6   Battery 
Battery packs were assumed to consist of spinel LiMnO2 cathode chemistry, which is 
consistent with the current state of technology. EPA recommended a maximum usable state of 
charge of 40% (from 30% charge to 70% charge) be incorporated as an operating window in 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-43 
 
Ricardo’s hybrid control logic.  This range may increase in subsequent real world examples as 
manufacturers gain more field experience with long term battery durability.  Additionally 
there will likely be more advances in battery construction and chemistry by 2025, so EPA 
considers these assumptions as conservative in view of the long term research currently 
underway in many battery research companies.  
3.3.1.2.12 Additional Technologies Modeled by Ricardo for 2011 Report 
The previous section discusses in detail those areas of the Ricardo simulation inputs 
which EPA provided recommendations to Ricardo on and which Ricardo agreed and made 
modifications to their initial suggestions.  EPA did review modeling inputs for many other 
technologies modeled by Ricardo, but for which we generally agreed with the reasonableness 
of Ricardo’s approach and did not request any changes.  This section summarizes at a high 
level some of the additional technologies considered by Ricardo.  Additional detail on these 
technologies is contained in the 2011 Ricardo final report. 
Diesel engines - Ricardo started with existing production engines and identified 
technology advances that would lead to further advances in fuel consumption.  These included 
many of the same technologies considered for advanced gasoline engines, such as engine 
friction reduction, improved fuel injection systems with higher injection pressures and more 
advanced controls, and better engine design to improve engine warm-up rate.    
Transmission Technologies - Taking a systems approach in the vehicle simulation 
modeling, Ricardo also introduced additional transmission and driveline oriented technologies 
that may be pathways to increased efficiency. Some of these key technological enablers 
include: shift optimization schedules, advanced clutches, torque converter design and lockup 
schedules. 
Automatic and Dual Clutch Transmissions - For the study timeframe, Ricardo 
assumed that eight-speed automatic transmissions will be in common use, as this supports 
more efficient operation, except for small cars, with energy losses expected to be about 20–
33% lower than in current automatic transmissions. Energy losses in both wet clutch and dry 
clutch DCTs are expected to be 40–50% lower than in current automatic transmissions. 
Transmission Shift Optimization - This advanced transmission shift optimization 
strategy tries to keep the engine operating near its most efficient point for a given power 
demand in effort to emulate a CVT. To protect against operating conditions out of normal 
range, several key parameters were identified, such as maximum engine speed, minimum 
lugging speed, and minimum delay between shifts. During development of this strategy, 
Ricardo estimated that fuel economy benefits of up to 5% can be obtained when compared to 
typical MY 2010 shift maps.  
Torque Converter Technology – Ricardo utilized a lockup clutch model with a multi-
damper system to provide earlier torque converter clutch engagement. The advanced 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-44 
 
automatic transmission applications allow torque converter lockup in any gear except first 
gear, up to sixth for the Small Car or eighth for the other LDV classes. 
  Shifting Clutch Technology - Shift clutch technology improves the thermal capacity 
of the shifting clutch to reduce plate count and lower clutch losses during shifting. Reducing 
the number of plates for the shifting process and reducing the hydraulic cooling requirements 
will increase the overall transmission efficiency for similar drivability characteristics.  
Dry Sump Technology – A dry sump lubrication system provides benefits by keeping 
the rotating members out of oil, which reduces losses due to windage and churning. This 
approach will provide a GHG emissions benefit across all vehicle classes, with the best 
benefits at higher speed. 
 
3.3.1.2.13 Baseline models built and run 
Once all of the inputs were established, Ricardo built the baseline models:   For these 
new (2010) baseline models Ricardo added a group of minor technologies, most of which 
already exist today in the market.  The technologies included 12V stop-start, 6-speed 
automatic transmission, a high efficiency (70% efficient) alternator, and a strategy – 
“alternator regen” – that charges the 12V battery more aggressively by increasing the 
alternator field upon vehicle deceleration .   
In the 2008 study Ricardo validated their baseline models with 2008 MY certification 
data.  Ricardo’s 2010 baseline model results provided effectiveness data for EPA to calibrate 
the lumped parameter model for some of the newly applied technologies.  These technologies 
included alternator regeneration, high efficiency alternator, and stop-start. 
For all model runs – the baselines and each of the advanced package nominal runs – 
EPA reviewed an extensive set of detailed intermediate output data for each model run.  The 
parameters that were reviewed are shown in Table 3-10.

Table 3-10:  Vehicle simulation output data reviewed
 
From this data, a set of summary statistics was generated to compare each baseline and 
nominal package run as a quality check.  This information was used as the starting point in the 
dialogue between EPA and Ricardo to identify technical issues with the models.  An example 
summary table (or “snapshot”) for the 2010 Standard Car baseline is provided in Figure 3-6.

Summary statistics were used as a first-order quality check on the model.  Sample 
checks included: 
• were average engine speed and load within or close to the best BSFC region for 
the vehicle’s engine map?   
• was transmission gear distribution reasonable and consistent between engine 
types?   
3.3.1.2.14 Nominal runs 
The Ricardo “nominal” runs refer to the initial set of vehicle simulation models built 
for each vehicle architecture and vehicle class.  These runs were used by EPA to assess the 
validity of the detailed model outputs (and hence the models themselves) prior to proceeding 
with the full design of experiment runs.  Table 3-11 shows the summary results from the raw 
nominal runs for the conventional stop-start vehicles (including 12V stop-start, 70% efficient 
alternator, shift optimizer and alternator regen, as well as a 3.5% improvement due to engine 
friction reduction).  Conventional automatic transmissions are assumed in all nominal runs.  
No road load reductions are included in these results.  GHG reductions are in reference to the 
2008 baseline vehicles.

3.3.1.2.15 Response Surface Model matrix runs 
After the nominal runs were completed according to the agreed-upon methodology, 
Ricardo set up a design of experiment matrix for each vehicle architecture.  The continuously 
swept variables were randomized in a Latin hypercube fashion to achieve a representative 
sample within each matrix (reference the Ricardo report for more details on the complex 
systems modeling approach used).  After a data review and removal of runs with errorso  (as 
needed) Ricardo then generated Response Surface Models (RSM) for use in the complex 
systems tool.  EPA used the tool to evaluate a range of potential engine displacements, final 
drive ratios and electric motor sizes (hybrids only) for each vehicle package, in an effort to

find the combination that would provide the greatest effectiveness while meeting EPA’s 
definition of “equivalent performance”. 
3.3.1.2.16 Equivalent performance definition 
The Ricardo output data provides several performance metrics, as discussed in 
3.3.1.2.10.  For simplicity, EPA assumed that a range of acceleration times for both a 0-60 
mph test and also a 0-30 mph test (emphasizing launch character) would provide a simple yet 
representative measure of a vehicle’s equivalent performance.   A range was chosen rather 
than assuming a single point value equal to the baseline.  This provided more acceptable data 
points and reduced error due to “noise” in the datasets. The acceptable acceleration times 
were as follows with respect to the baseline: 
0-60 mph: 5 percent slower to 15 percent faster as compared to baseline  
0-30 mph: 10 percent slower to 20 percent faster as compared to baseline 
The range above reflects a deviation from the actual baseline value that is well within 
the normal variation of acceleration times for different vehicle models within a given vehicle 
class. 
3.3.1.2.17 Treatment of “turbo lag” in performance runs for turbocharged engines 
A common critique of comparisons of the modeled performance of highly 
turbocharged engines with naturally-aspirated engines is that consideration must be given to 
the delay in producing full engine load associated with the turbocharger, commonly referred 
to as “turbo lag”.   In technical discussions, Ricardo’s engine experts assured EPA that the 
dual-sequential designs of the turbocharger systems in the engines in this study should 
mitigate most of this phenomenon often seen on older-model vehicles.   However, due to the 
heavy reliance on turbocharged engines as a significant source of motive force for the high 
BMEP engines evaluated in this project, EPA took this sensitivity further into account. 
Ricardo’s initial model of WOT operation was based on a steady-state model of 
engine torque, assuming that the engine would be able to instantaneously reach a desired level 
of output torque, without consideration of the intake manifold filling dynamics or the 
mechanical inertia of the engine.  EPA raised this as an issue, more in terms of properly 
representing vehicle performance than for effectiveness differences.  EPA reviewed its own 
engine development data and proposed a somewhat conservative time constant for both the 
naturally aspirated engines (0.3 s) and the turbocharged engines (1.5 s), to apply to the engine 
torque response in the vehicle performance runs (these are shown below in Figure 3-7).  In 
turn, Ricardo recalculated the acceleration times for the 0-30 and 0-60 mph runs to reflect the 
slower time constants.  As a result, EPA used these two performance metrics exclusively in 
determining “equivalent performance”.  A transient engine/turbo model would have improved 
the accuracy of the model somewhat; however, it was beyond the scope of this project.

Figure 3-7:  EPA proposed time constants and resulting effect on torque rise time for turbocharging 
3.3.1.2.18 Treatment of engine response and “turbo lag” in cycle simulations and 
control logic algorithms  
The EASY5 model used in the Ricardo simulations included engine and driveline 
inertia effects which account for some of the real-world transient torque delays.  However, the 
simulation modeling did not include an adjustment to account for transient engine response 
delays (e.g. inclusion of time constant offsets), to simulate naturally aspirated and 
turbocharged engine response delays associated with intake manifold gas dynamics and 
turbocharger response delay.  Consideration of engine response delay might affect how 
transmission shift optimization control logic and advanced HEV control logic is structured, 
and potentially affect GHG and fuel economy projections, particularly for boosted and 
downsized engines.  EPA and Ricardo believe that the impact is small over the city and 
highway fuel economy test cycles.  However, the agencies seek comment on the fuel 
economy impact of transient delays over the test cycles not accounted for in the Ricardo 
modeling.   
 
3.3.1.2.19 “Equivalent performance” results for conventional stop-start vehicles 
The following tables show the results from the complex systems tool, when 
displacement, final drive ratio and electric motor size are varied to optimize GHG and fuel 
consumption reduction effectiveness at equivalent performance for conventional stop-start, P2 
and powersplit hybrids.  Most of the vehicles show little change in performance between the

nominal runs and the equivalent performance results from the complex systems tool. Table 
3-14 through Table 3-18 illustrate the various effects of changing road loads on the various 
vehicle package configurations.  Table 3-14, Table 3-16, and Table 3-16, respectively, show 
the equivalent performance results for the conventional stop-start (for both automatic 
transmissions and DCTs) and the P2 hybrid vehicles (modeled only as DCTs).  No road load 
reductions are included in Table 3-14 through Table 3-16.  For comparison, a second set of 
tables (Table 3-17 and Table 3-18) give equivalent performance results for conventional stop-
start vehicles and P2 hybrids, each including example road load reductionsp of 20% mass 
reduction, 20% aerodynamic drag reduction and 10% rolling resistance reduction. 
The package effectiveness results from the equivalent performance runs were used in 
the datasets to calibrate the individual technology effectiveness values within the lumped 
parameter model.  The development of the lumped parameter model is described in detail in 
Section 1.5 of EPA’s RIA.

 Note that in the regulatory fleet analysis, levels of road load reduction technologies (e.g., mass reduction) will

3.3.1.2.20 Validation of vehicle simulation results 
Ricardo described the process used to validate the baseline vehicles in its report1.  
Ideally it would be desirable to validate the simulation results with actual vehicle certification 
test data.  However, due to the nature and intended time frame (10+ years into the future) of 
the technologies modeled within the vehicle classes, it is difficult to find many real-world 
examples of specific technologies at the level of development reflected within the latest 
simulation models.  Furthermore, there are no current vehicles in production that contain all 
(or even a majority) of the multiple advanced technologies embedded within the models so it 
is difficult to make meaningful direct comparisons between actual vehicles and model results.  
Finally, there is no direct way to disaggregate the various advanced technologies and isolate 
only the relevant pieces for evaluation (e.g., an advanced turbocharged engine at an interim 
BMEP level with a baseline-level transmission without stop-start): the lumped parameter 
model was developed for this very analytical capability.  A full description of the lumped 
parameter model (including example comparisons of existing vehicle models to lumped 
parameter estimates) is provided in 3.3.2.

3.3.1.2.21   The “efficient frontier” capability in Complex Systems tool 
A powerful feature of the Complex Systems tool is the “efficient frontier” function, 
which provides a graphical representation of the RSM data for the vehicle configuration of 
interest.  The user can identify the combination of various attributes (engine displacement, 
final drive ratio, motor size, etc) which project the best model effectiveness.  Figure 3-8 
below is an example of the efficient frontier for a Standard Car with a cooled EGR 
turbocharged engine and a dry clutch DCT.  The light red line along the top of the data set 
represents the best fuel economy at each 0-60 mph acceleration time within the desired 
window.  The solid dark blue points represent the combinations that achieve both the desired 
0-60 and 0-30 mph criteria for equivalent performance.  In this way, it is easy to quantify the 
best effectiveness for a given technology package.

3.3.1.2.22 Significance of the Complex Systems tool  
The complex systems tool was used not only to identify the optimal combination of 
input variables for each vehicle architecture, but also to analyze trends in the input variables 
for quality assurance (i.e., to make sure the response surface models made engineering sense), 
and to establish numerical relationships between these variables for the lumped parameter 
model calibration.  Shown below are a few examples of the types of inquiries made via the 
complex systems tool:

3.3.1.2.22.1 Effects of motor size (HEVs) 
EPA reviewed the effects of motor size on hybrids.  As motor size is increased, there 
is more opportunity to recapture energy during braking (because more powerful motors can 
recover all of the energy in more severe braking events).  However, oversized motors also 
experience reduced efficiency as they operate in a less efficient operating region.  This is 
shown in Figure 3-9 below, which shows a sweep of motor size vs. fuel economy for both the 
FTP/HWFE combined and also the high speed/load US06 cycle.  Note that the optimum 
motor size increases with respect to the US06 cycle due to more severe braking and 
acceleration rates.

3.3.1.2.22.2 Effects of engine displacement 
EPA reviewed the effects of engine displacement at equivalent performance to 
determine if there would be an “optimal” range of downsizing for best effectiveness.  
Surprisingly, there was little benefit beyond downsizing the engine past a minimal point.  
Shown in Figure 3-10 is an example complex systems tool graph with fuel economy plotted 
against engine displacement multiplier (compared to the “nominal” engine displacement) for 
the Truck class for three gasoline turbocharged engine packages and one diesel engine 
package (note all packages included 20% weight reduction, 20% aerodynamic drag reduction, 
and 10% rolling resistance reduction):

• The diesel engine result shows that the nominal engine in this case was originally 
oversized because it was scaled on engine power not more accurately on engine 
torque and continued displacement reduction would improve fuel economy.  For 
this package, the displacement for optimal fuel economy is smaller than 50% of 
the nominal value, however; when considering equivalent vehicle performance, the 
minimum diesel displacement increases to roughly 70% of the nominal value.   
• In contrast, the gasoline turbo engine results shown reflect a relative insensitivity 
of displacement to fuel economy for these advanced vehicles.   
 
Figure 3-10:  Example displacement sweep for Truck class in complex systems tool 
 
Figure 3-10 shows that as modeled, the swept displacement range is not large enough 
for the advanced gasoline turbocharged engines.  The displacement multiplier for these 
engines must be greater than 1.3x the nominal displacement before the fuel economy would 
degrade substantially.  As the displacement drops below about 65% of the nominal (already 
downsized) value, the efficiency decreases, as the engine load must be much higher to provide 
the same required power.  Regardless, the total fuel efficiency decrease from optimal is rather

small compared to today’s engines.  A 27-bar cooled EGR turbocharged GDI engine map for 
a large carq was reverse-engineered from the Ricardo 10 hz output data, and is provided in 
Figure 3-11.  The efficiency of this family of engines is very robust to changes in engine 
displacement because the highlighted BSFC region of interest (the second one out from the 
minimum BSFC “island”) spans a large speed and load range.  As a result, significant changes 
in displacement do not greatly reduce fuel efficiency.   As displacement increases, the average 
operating points for the engine over a given test cycle will trend towards the lower left (lower 
speed, lower loadr) portion of the map.  In this case the points on the plot exist within the 
same BSFC contour, so there is little degradation in engine efficiency with increasing 
displacement (and drivetrain efficiency may improve at higher gears, potentially resulting in a 
fuel economy increase).  Were the displacement to be increased much further, the operating 
region would cross the contour and fuel efficiency would begin to drop much more 
dramatically.

 Load decreases as it is reflective of a % of the maximum achievable torque and torque is increasing with

The mass reduction effectiveness, originally estimated at roughly 6% GHG reduction 
for a 10% reduction in mass, has been revised to reflect data such as that shown above.   
Isolated from benefits due to engine downsizing opportunities, the effectiveness of weight 
reduction for the non-hybrid packages is on the order of 5% per 10% weight reduction, while 
mass reduction for the P2 hybrid (or any hybrid) is reduced, on the order of 4.5% per 10% 
reduction due to the synergies with brake energy recovery (less braking energy is recoverable 
because the vehicle weighs less).  The lumped parameter tool was also revised to incorporate 
the synergies of weight reduction and hybrids.   
3.3.1.2.24 Vehicle simulation report peer review process 
As previously discussed, vehicle simulation modeling is a very detailed, 
mathematically intensive approach which relies heavily on numerical engineering inputs.  
These inputs (e.g., engine maps, transmission efficiency, control logic, etc.) are the heart of 
the model and are derived directly from proprietary engineering knowledge of components 
and subsystems.  To simulate advanced engine and vehicle concepts, state-of-the-art 
knowledge must be applied and converted into modeling inputs.  Public domain information 
is rarely at the forefront of technology, and of little use in modeling vehicles in the 2017-2025 
time frame.

Engineering details on advanced vehicle technologies are closely guarded in industry, 
and engineering services companies which develop and generate this confidential information 
rely on it to remain competitive in the marketplace.  Therefore, it is difficult, if not 
impossible, to be completely transparent with an advanced vehicle simulation model and 
make all of the inputs available for public review.  EPA commissioned an external peer 
review of the 2011 Ricardo simulation project and report.  The peer reviewers selected were 
highly respected members of academia and industry, all with substantial backgrounds in 
automotive technology.  The list of peer reviewers and their credentials is provided in the 
associated peer review report31. 
EPA charged the peer reviewers to thoroughly evaluate the body of work with respect 
to the following topics: 
• Adequacy of the numerical inputs (engine technology selection, battery inputs, 
accessory load assumptions, etc) and highlight any caveats or limitations that 
would affect the final results. 
• Validity and applicability of the simulation methodology, and if it adequately 
addresses synergies  
• The results, and their validity and applicability to the light-duty vehicle fleet in the 
2020-2025 timeframe.  
• Completeness of the report (does it offer enough detail of the modeling process) 
• The overall adequacy of the report for predicting the effectiveness of these 
technologies, and suggest recommendations for improvement 
 
 
The first round of comments was reflective of the reviewer’s lack of access to model 
inputs.  Because the confidential inputs were initially withheld (for reasons described above), 
“lack of transparency” was a consistent theme amongst the reviewers, so much that they 
expressed frustration with their ability to evaluate the model methodology and the quality of 
the inputs.  Additionally, due to the lack of access to Ricardo proprietary input data the peer 
reviewers expressed concern that they could not adequately judge the validity or accuracy of 
the input information or the simulation results.   EPA worked with Ricardo to provide the peer 
reviewers with access to all of the detailed confidential modeling inputs under non disclosure 
agreements.  With this necessary information, 3 of the 5 peer reviewers submitted a second 
round of comments which were generally more specific.  In turn, Ricardo modified the report 
to address some of the comments, and they developed a response to comments document 
which covered the comments from the peer review.  One common theme called for increased 
detail in how the inputs were generated.  To address these requests, Ricardo provided the 
detailed case studies that were used in the development of the engine maps for the cooled 
EGR boosted engines and the Atkinson engines for hybrids.  Ricardo also elaborated on the 
hybrid control strategy, complete with state flow diagrams of operating modes, as well as a 
discussion of how hybrid control strategy was optimized.  Additional transmission input 
details were provided, including an overview of the development of advanced gear 
efficiencies and how the optimized shift strategy was applied.

The docket to this proposal contains Ricardo’s response to comment document (which 
includes the first version of the Ricardo report that was peer reviewed and both rounds of peer 
review comments), and Ricardo’s final report.3233  The agencies seek comment on the all of 
these references and on the responsiveness of the final report to the peer review comments.   
3.3.1.3 Future Argonne National Laboratory Simulation Study 
The U.S. D.O.T. Volpe Center has entered into a contract with Argonne National 
Laboratory (ANL) to provide full vehicle simulation modeling support for this MYs 2017-
2025 rulemaking.  While modeling was not completed in time for use in this NPRM, NHTSA 
intends to use this modeling to validate/update technology effectiveness estimates and 
synergy factors for the final rulemaking analysis.  This simulation modeling will be 
accomplished using ANL’s full vehicle simulation tool called “Autonomie,” which is the 
successor to ANL’s Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT) simulation tool, and ANL’s 
expertise with advanced vehicle technologies. 
3.3.2 Lumped parameter Modeling  
3.3.2.1 Overview of the lumped parameter model 
As a more practical alternative to full vehicle simulation, EPA developed a “lumped 
parameter model” that estimates the effectiveness of various technology combinations or 
“packages,” in a manner that accounts for synergies between technologies.  In the analysis 
supporting the MYs 2012-2016 light duty vehicle GHG and CAFE rule, EPA built over 140 
packages for use in its OMEGA model, which spanned 19 vehicle classes and over 1100 
vehicle models.  Vehicle simulation modeling performed for EPA by Ricardo, PLC, was used 
to calibrate the lumped parameter model.  Although DOT’s analysis supporting the MYs 
2012-2016 CAFE rule applied technologies incrementally, rather than specifying packages in 
advance, DOT calibrated CAFE model inputs, using EPA’s lumped parameter model, to 
harmonize as fully as practical with estimates produced by EPA’s lumped parameter model. 
To support this rulemaking, EPA has updated its lumped parameter model and 
calibrated it with updated vehicle simulation work performed for EPA by Ricardo, PLC.  As 
in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, DOT has calibrated inputs including synergy factors, to 
the CAFE model to as fully as practical align with estimates produced by EPA’s lumped 
parameter model. 
Both agencies are continuing to conduct and sponsor vehicle simulation efforts to 
improve inputs to the agencies’ respective modeling systems, and both agencies expect that 
the final rules will be informed by this ongoing work. 
The basis for EPA’s lumped parameter analysis is a first-principles energy balance 
that estimates the manner in which the chemical energy of the fuel is converted into various 
forms of thermal and mechanical energy on the vehicle.  The analysis accounts for the 
dissipation of energy into the different categories of energy losses, including each of the 
following: 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-66 
 
• Second law losses (thermodynamic losses inherent in the combustion of fuel), 
• Heat lost from the combustion process to the exhaust and coolant, 
• Pumping losses, i.e., work performed by the engine during the intake and exhaust 
strokes, 
• Friction losses in the engine, 
• Transmission losses, associated with friction and other parasitic losses of the 
gearbox, torque converter (when applicable) and driveline 
• Accessory losses, related directly to the parasitics associated with the engine 
accessories, 
• Vehicle road load (tire and aerodynamic) losses; 
• Inertial losses (energy dissipated as heat in the brakes) 
 
The remaining energy is available to propel the vehicle. It is assumed that the baseline vehicle 
has a fixed percentage of fuel lost to each category.  Each technology is grouped into the 
major types of engine loss categories it reduces.  In this way, interactions between multiple 
technologies that are applied to the vehicle may be determined. When a technology is applied, 
the lumped parameter model estimates its effects by modifying the appropriate loss categories 
by a given percentage. Then, each subsequent technology that reduces the losses in an already 
improved category has less of a potential impact than it would if applied on its own. 
 
Using a lumped parameter approach for calculating package effectiveness provides necessary 
grounding to physical principles.  Due to the mathematical structure of the model, it naturally 
limits the maximum effectiveness achievable for a family of similar technologiess.  This can 
prove useful when computer-simulated packages are compared to a “theoretical limit” as a 
plausibility check.  Additionally, the reduction of certain energy loss categories directly 
impacts the effects on others.  For example, as mass is reduced the benefits of brake energy 
recovery decreases because there is not as much inertia energy to recapture. 
 
Figure 3-13 is an example spreadsheet used by EPA to estimate the package effectiveness and 
the synergistic impacts of a technology package for a standard-size car.

 For example, if only 4% of fuel energy is lost (in a baseline engine) to pumping work, leveraging multiple 
technologies to theoretically eliminate all pumping losses would yield an aggregate reduction of no more than 
15% in fuel consumption.

The LP model has been updated from the MYs 2012-2016 final rule to support the 
MYs 2017-2025 proposed standards.  Changes were made to include new technologies for 
2017 and beyond, improve fidelity for baseline attributes and technologies, and better 
represent hybrids based on more comprehensive vehicle simulation modeling.  EPA RIA 
Chapter 1 provides details of the methodology used to update and refine the model.

3.4 What cost and effectiveness estimates have the agencies used for each technology? 
As discussed in the previous sections, many the effectiveness estimates for this 
proposal, including the estimates for the technologies carried over from the MYs 2012-2016 
final rule, been derived from the 2011 Ricardo study and corresponding updated version of 
the lumped-parameter model.  It is important to note that when referencing the effectiveness 
estimates from the MYs 2012-2016 the final rule the agencies used the average of the range 
presented.  If for example, the effectiveness range for technology X was determined to be 1 to 
2 percent then the agencies used a value of 1.5 percent in their respective analyses.  However, 
the effectiveness ranges that are presented for the MYs 2017-2025 analysis, as informed by 
the Ricardo 2011 study, define the range of estimates used by the agencies for the different 
vehicle types.  Again using technology X as an example, if the range is now defined as 2.0 to 
2.5 percent then for small passenger cars (subcompact or compact) the estimated effectiveness 
might be 2.0 percent but for large cars an estimate of 2.5 percent might be used.            
3.4.1 Engine technologies 
One thing that is immediately clear from the cost tables that follow is that we have 
updated our costing approach for some technologies in an effort to provide better granularity 
in our estimates.  This is easily seen in Table 3-21, among others, where we list costs for 
technologies by engine configuration—in-line or “I” versus “V”—and/or by number of 
cylinders.  In the 2012-2016 final rule, we showed costs for a small car, large car, large truck, 
etc.  The problem with that approach is that different vehicle classes can have many different 
sized engines.  This will be especially true going forward as more turbocharged and 
downsized engines enter the fleet.  For example, we project that many vehicles in the large car 
class some of which, today, have V8 engines would have highly turbocharged I4 engines 
under the proposal.  As such, we would not want to estimate the large car costs of engine 
friction reduction—which have always and continue to be based on the number of cylinders—
assuming that all large cars have V8 engines. 
 
3.4.1.1 Low Friction Lubricants  
One of the most basic methods of reducing fuel consumption in gasoline engines is the 
use of lower viscosity engine lubricants.  More advanced multi-viscosity engine oils are 
available today with improved performance in a wider temperature band and with better 
lubricating properties.  This can be accomplished by changes to the oil base stock (e.g., 
switching engine lubricants from a Group I base oils to lower-friction, lower viscosity Group 
III synthetic) and through changes to lubricant additive packages (e.g., friction modifiers and 
viscosity improvers).  The use of 5W-30 motor oil is now widespread and auto manufacturers 
are introducing the use of even lower viscosity oils, such as 5W-20 and 0W-20, to improve 
cold-flow properties and reduce cold start friction.  However, in some cases, changes to the 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-73 
 
crankshaft, rod and main bearings and changes to the mechanical tolerances of engine 
components may be required.  In all cases, durability testing would be required to ensure that 
durability is not compromised.  The shift to lower viscosity and lower friction lubricants will 
also improve the effectiveness of valvetrain technologies such as cylinder deactivation, which 
rely on a minimum oil temperature (viscosity) for operation. 
Several manufacturers have previously commented confidentially, that low friction 
lubricants could have an effectiveness value between 0 to 1 percent.  The agencies used the 
average effectiveness of 0.5 in the MYs 2012-2016 final rule. For purposes of this proposal, 
the agencies relied on the lump parameter model and the range for the effectiveness of low 
friction lubricant is 0.5 to 0.8 percent.  
In the 2012-2016 rule, the 2010 TAR and the recent HD GHG rule, EPA and NHTSA 
used a direct manufacturing cost (DMC) of $3 (2007$) and considered that cost to be 
independent of vehicle class since the engineering work required should apply to any engine 
size.  The agencies continue to believe that this cost is appropriate and have updated it to $3 
(2009$) for this analysis.  No learning is applied to this technology so the DMC remains $3 
year-over-year.  The agencies have used a low complexity ICM of 1.24 for this technology 
through 2018 and 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-20u  Note that low 
friction lubes are expected to exceed 85 percent penetration by the 2017 MY.

3.4.1.2 Engine Friction Reduction  
In addition to low friction lubricants, manufacturers can also reduce friction and 
improve fuel consumption by improving the design of engine components and subsystems.  
Approximately 10 percent of the energy consumed by a vehicle is lost to friction, and just 
over half is due to frictional losses within the engine.34  Examples include improvements in 
low-tension piston rings, piston skirt design, roller cam followers, improved crankshaft design 
and bearings, material coatings, material substitution, more optimal thermal management, and 
piston and cylinder surface treatments.  Additionally, as computer-aided modeling software 
                                                 
u
  Note that the costs developed for low friction lubes for this analysis reflect the costs associated with any 
engine changes that would be required as well as any durability testing that may be required.  
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

continues to improve, more opportunities for evolutionary friction reductions may become 
available. 
All reciprocating and rotating components in the engine are potential candidates for 
friction reduction, and minute improvements in several components can add up to a 
measurable fuel economy improvement.  In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies relied on 
the 2002 NAS, NESCCAF and EEA reports as well as confidential manufacturer data that 
suggested a range of effectiveness for engine friction reduction to be between 1 to 3 percent. 
Because of the incremental nature of the CAFE model, NHTSA used the narrower range of 1 
to 2 percent, which resulted in an average effectiveness of 1.5 percent. Based on the 2011 
Ricardo study the effectiveness for engine friction reduction range has been changed to 2.0 to 
2.7 percent..  For this proposal the agencies have added a second level of incremental 
improvements in engine friction reduction over multiple vehicle redesign cycles.  This second 
level of engine friction reduction includes some additional improvements to low friction 
lubricant, relative to the low friction lubricant technology discussed above. The technologies 
for this second level of engine friction reduction and low friction lubricants is considered to 
be mature only after MY 2017. The effectiveness for this second level, relative to the base 
engine, is 3.4 to 4.8 percent based on the lump parameter model. Because of the incremental 
nature of the CAFE model, NHTSA used the effectiveness range of 0.83 to 1.37 percent 
incremental to the first level of engine friction reduction and low friction lubricants. 
In the 2012-2016 rule, the 2010 TAR and the HD GHG final rule, NHTSA and EPA 
used a cost estimate of $11 (2007$) per cylinder direct manufacturing cost, or $12 (2009$) per 
cylinder in this analysis.  No learning is applied to this technology so the DMC remains $12 
(2009$) year-over-year.  The agencies have used a low complexity ICM of 1.24 for this 
technology through 2018 and 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-21.  
Note that the first level of engine friction reduction is expected to exceed 85 percent 
penetration by the 2017 MY.

The agencies have estimated the DMC of this technology—a second level of friction 
reduction with a second level of low friction lube—at double the combined DMCs of the first 
level of engine friction reduction and first level of low friction lube (double the DMC relative 
to the baseline).  As a result, the costs of the second level of engine friction reduction are as 
shown in Table 3-22. For EFR2 the agencies have used a low complexity ICM of 1.24

3.4.1.3 Cylinder Deactivation  
In conventional spark-ignited engines throttling the airflow controls engine torque 
output.  At partial loads, efficiency can be improved by using cylinder deactivation instead of 
throttling.  Cylinder deactivation (DEAC) can improve engine efficiency by disabling or 
deactivating (usually) half of the cylinders when the load is less than half of the engine’s total 
torque capability – the valves are kept closed, and no fuel is injected – as a result, the trapped 
air within the deactivated cylinders is simply compressed and expanded as an air spring, with 
reduced friction and heat losses.  The active cylinders combust at almost double the load 
required if all of the cylinders were operating.  Pumping losses are significantly reduced as 
long as the engine is operated in this “part-cylinder” mode. 
Cylinder deactivation control strategy relies on setting maximum manifold absolute 
pressures or predicted torque within which it can deactivate the cylinders.  Noise and 
vibration issues reduce the operating range to which cylinder deactivation is allowed, 
although manufacturers continue exploring vehicle changes that enable increasing the amount 
of time that cylinder deactivation might be suitable.  Some manufacturers may choose to 
adopt active engine mounts and/or active noise cancellations systems to address NVH 
concerns and to allow a greater operating range of activation (and the agencies have estimated 
the costs for doing so, as noted below).  Manufacturers have legitimately stated that use of 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-76 
 
DEAC on 4 cylinder engines would cause unacceptable NVH; therefore, as in the 2012-2016 
rule and the TAR, the agencies are not applying cylinder deactivation to 4-cylinder engines in 
evaluating potential emission reductions/fuel economy improvements and attendant costs. 
Cylinder deactivation has seen a recent resurgence thanks to better valvetrain designs 
and engine controls.  General Motors and Chrysler Group have incorporated cylinder 
deactivation across a substantial portion of their V8-powered lineups.  Honda (Odyssey, Pilot) 
offers V6 models with cylinder deactivation.   
Effectiveness improvements scale roughly with engine displacement-to-vehicle weight 
ratio: the higher displacement-to-weight vehicles, operating at lower relative loads for normal 
driving, have the potential to operate in part-cylinder mode more frequently. 
NHTSA and EPA reviewed estimates from the 2012-2016 final rule, TAR, the RIA for 
the heavy-duty GHG and fuel consumption rule. The OMEGA model, which is based on 
packages, applied a 6 percent reduction in CO2 emissions depending on vehicle class.  The 
CAFE model, due to its incremental nature, used a range depending on the engine valvetrain 
configuration.  For example, for DOHC engines which are already equipped with DCP and 
DVVLD, there is little benefit that can be achieved from adding cylinder deactivation since 
the pumping work has already been minimized and internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) 
rates are maximized, so the effectiveness is only up to 0.5 percent for DEACD.  For SOHC 
engines which have CCP and DVVLS applied, effectiveness ranged from 2.5 to 3 percent for 
DEACS.  For OHV engines, without VVT or VVL technologies, the effectiveness for 
DEACO ranged from 3.9 to 5.5 percent. 
For this proposal the agencies, taking into account the additional review and the work 
performed for the Ricardo study, have revised the estimates for cylinder deactivation. The 
effectiveness for relative to the base engine is 4.7 to 6.5 percent based on the lump parameter 
model.  Because of the incremental nature of the CAFE model, NHTSA used the 
effectiveness range of 0.44 to 0.66 percent incremental for SOHC and DOHC applications. 
For OHV applications, the effectiveness was increased slightly with a range of 4.66 to 6.30 
percent.  
In the 2012-2016 rule and the 2010 TAR, the agencies used a DMC estimate of $140 
(2007$) and $157 (2007$) for cylinder deactivation technology on V6 and V8 engines, 
respectively.  The DMC’s become $144 (2009$) and $162 (2009$) for this analysis and are 
considered applicable in the 2015 MY.  This technology is considered to be on the flat-portion 
of the learning curve.  The agencies have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 to this 
technology through 2018 and 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-23.

If lost motion devices are on the engine, the cost of DEAC as applied to SOHC and 
DOHC engines could be as low as $32 in MY 2017.  This $32 accounts for the potential 
additional application of active engine mounts on SOHC and DOHC engines and can only be 
applied on 50 percent of the vehicles.  Further, this SOHC and DOHC engine estimate is 
relevant to the CAFE model only because the OMEGA model does not apply technologies in 
the same incremental fashion as the CAFE model.  
3.4.1.4 Variable Valve Timing (VVT) 
Variable valve timing (VVT) encompasses a family of valve-train designs that alter 
the timing of the intake valve, exhaust valve, or both, primarily to reduce pumping losses, 
increase specific power, and control the level of residual gases in the cylinder.  VVT reduces 
pumping losses when the engine is lightly loaded by controlling valve timing closer to an 
optimum needed to sustain horsepower and torque.  VVT can also improve volumetric 
efficiency at higher engine speeds and loads.  Additionally, VVT can be used to alter (and 
optimize) the effective compression ratio where it is advantageous for certain engine 
operating modes (e.g., in the Atkinson Cycle). 
VVT has now become a widely adopted technology:  in MY 2010, approximately 86 
percent of all new cars and light trucks had engines with some method of variable valve 
timing.35   Manufacturers are currently using many different types of variable valve timing, 
which have a variety of different names and methods.  Manufacturers are currently using 
many different types of variable valve timing, which have a variety of different names and 
methods. Therefore, the degree of further improvement across the fleet is limited by the level 
of valvetrain technology already implemented on the vehicles.  Information found in the 2008 
baseline vehicle fleet file is used to determine the degree to which VVT technologies have 
already been applied to particular vehicles to ensure the proper level of VVT technology, if 
any, is applied.  The three major types of VVT are listed below. 
Each of the three implementations of VVT uses a cam phaser to adjust the camshaft 
angular position relative to the crankshaft position, referred to as “camshaft phasing.”  The 
phase adjustment results in changes to the pumping work required by the engine to 
accomplish the gas exchange process.  The majority of current cam phaser applications use 
hydraulically-actuated units, powered by engine oil pressure and managed by a solenoid that 
controls the oil pressure supplied to the phaser. 
3.4.1.4.1 Intake Cam Phasing (ICP) 
Valvetrains with ICP, which is the simplest of the cam phasing technologies, can 
modify the timing of the inlet valves by phasing the intake camshaft while the exhaust valve 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-78 
 
timing remains fixed.  This requires the addition of a cam phaser on each bank of intake 
valves on the engine.  An in-line 4-cylinder engine has one bank of intake valves, while V-
configured engines have two banks of intake valves. 
In the MYs 2012-2016 final rule and TAR, NHTSA and EPA assumed an 
effectiveness range of 2 to 3 percent for ICP. Based on the 2011 Ricardo study and updated 
lumped-parameter model the agencies have fined tuned the range to be 2.1 to 2.7 percent. 
In the 2012-2016 rule and the 2010 TAR, the agencies estimated the DMC of a cam 
phaser needed for VVT-intake at $37 (2007$).  This DMC becomes $38 (2009$) for this 
analysis and is considered applicable in the 2015 MY.  This cost would be required for each 
cam shaft controlling intake valves, as such an overhead cam I4 would need one phaser, an 
overhead cam V6 or V8 would need two phasers, and an overhead valve V6 or V8 would 
need just one.  This technology is considered to be on the flat-portion of the learning curve.  
The agencies have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 to this technology through 2018 and 
1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-24.

3.4.1.4.2 Coupled Cam Phasing (CCP)  
Valvetrains with coupled (or coordinated) cam phasing can modify the timing of both 
the inlet valves and the exhaust valves an equal amount by phasing the camshaft of a single 
overhead cam (SOHC) engine or an overhead valve (OHV) engine.  For overhead cam 
engines, this requires the addition of a cam phaser on each bank of the engine.  Thus, an in-
line 4-cylinder engine has one cam phaser, while SOHC V-engines have two cam phasers.  
For overhead valve (OHV) engines, which have only one camshaft to actuate both inlet and 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-79 
 
exhaust valves, CCP is the only VVT implementation option available and requires only one 
cam phaser.v 
The agencies’ MYs 2012-2016 final rule estimated the effectiveness of CCP to be 
between 1 to 4 percent.  Due to the incremental nature and decision tree logic of the Volpe 
model, NHTSA estimated the effectiveness for coupled cam phasing on a SOHC engine to be 
1 to 3 percent and 1 to 1.5 percent for coupled cam phasing on an overhead valve engine.  
For this proposal the agencies, taking into account the additional review and the work 
performed for the 2011 Ricardo study, have revised the estimates for cylinder deactivation. 
The effectiveness relative to the base engine is 4.1 to 5.5 percent based on the lump parameter 
model. Because of the incremental nature of the CAFE model, NHTSA used the incremental 
effectiveness range of 4.14 to 5.36 percent for SOHC applications; an increase over the 2012-
16 final rule and 2010 TAR. For OHV applications, CCP was paired with discrete variable 
valve lift (DVVL) to form a new technology descriptor called variable valve actuation 
(VVA). VVA will be discussed later in Chapter 3.  
The same cam phaser has been assumed for intake cam phasing as for coupled cam 
phasing, thus CCPs are identical to those presented in Table 3-24. 
 
3.4.1.4.3 Dual Cam Phasing (DCP) 
The most flexible VVT design is dual (independent) cam phasing, where the intake 
and exhaust valve opening and closing events are controlled independently.  This allows the 
option of controlling valve overlap, which can be used as an internal EGR strategy.  At low 
engine loads, DCP creates a reduction in pumping losses, resulting in improved fuel 
consumption/reduced CO2 emissions.  Increased internal EGR also results in lower engine-out 
NOX emissions.  The amount by which fuel consumption is improved and CO2 emissions are 
reduced depends on the residual tolerance of the combustion system. Additional 
improvements are observed at idle, where low valve overlap could result in improved 
combustion stability, potentially reducing idle fuel consumption. 
For the 2012-2016 final rule and TAR the EPA and NHTSA assumed an effectiveness 
range for DCP to be between 3 to 5 percent relative to a base engine or 2 to 3 relative to an 
engine with ICP.  The agencies have updated this range, based on the updated lumped-
parameter model to be 4.1 to 5.5 percent relative to a base engine or 2.0 to 2.7 percent relative 
to an engine with ICP.

 It is also noted that coaxial camshaft developments would allow other VVT options to be applied to OHV 
engines. However, since they would potentially be adopted on a limited number of OHV engines NHTSA did 
not include them in the decision tree. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-80 
 
The costs for VVT-dual cam phasing are the same per phaser as described above for 
VVT-intake. However, for DCP, an additional cam phaser is required for each camshaft 
controlling exhaust valves. As a result, an overhead cam I4 would need two phasers, an 
overhead cam V6 or V8 would need four phasers, and an overhead valve V6 or V8 would 
need two.  This technology is considered to be on the flat-portion of the learning curve.  The 
agencies have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 to this technology through 2018 and 
1.29 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-25.

3.4.1.5 Variable Valve Lift (VVL) 
Controlling the lift of the valves provides a potential for further efficiency 
improvements.  By optimizing the valve-lift profile for specific engine operating regions, the 
pumping losses can be reduced by reducing the amount of throttling required to produce the 
desired engine power output.  By moving the throttling losses further downstream of the 
throttle valve, the heat transfer losses that occur from the throttling process are directed into 
the fresh charge-air mixture just prior to compression, delaying the onset of knock-limited 
combustion processes.  Variable valve lift control can also be used to induce in-cylinder 
mixture motion, which improves fuel-air mixing and can result in improved thermodynamic 
efficiency.  Variable valve lift control can also potentially reduce overall valvetrain friction.  
At the same time, such systems may also incur increased parasitic losses associated with their 
actuation mechanisms.  A number of manufacturers have already implemented VVL into their 
fleets (Toyota, Honda, and BMW), but overall this technology is still available for most of the 
fleet.  There are two major classifications of variable valve lift, described below: 
3.4.1.5.1 Discrete Variable Valve Lift (DVVL) 
Discrete variable valve lift (DVVL) systems allow the selection between two or three 
discrete cam profiles by means of a hydraulically-actuated mechanical system.  By optimizing 
the cam profile for specific engine operating regions, the pumping losses can be reduced by 
reducing the amount of throttling required to produce the desired engine power output.  This 
increases the efficiency of the engine.  These cam profiles consist of a low and a high-lift 
lobe, and may include an inert or blank lobe to incorporate cylinder deactivation (in the case 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-81 
 
of a 3-step DVVL system).  DVVL is normally applied together with VVT control.  DVVL is 
also known as Cam Profile Switching (CPS).  DVVL is a mature technology with low 
technical risk.  
NHTSA’s and EPA’s MY 2012-16 final rule, previously-received confidential manufacturer 
data, and report from NESCCAF, all estimated the effectiveness of DVVL to be between 1 to 
4 percent above that realized by VVT systems.  Based on the 2011 Ricardo study, NHTSA 
and EPA have revised the effectiveness range of DVVL systems to 2.8 to 3.9 percent above 
that realized by VVT systems.   
In the 2012-2016 rule and the 2010 TAR, the agencies estimated the DMC of DVVL 
at $116 (2007$), $169 (2007$) and $241 (2007$) for an I4, V6 and V8 engine, respectively.  
These DMCs become $120 (2009$), $174 (2009$) and $248 (2009$) for this analysis all of 
which are considered applicable in the 2015MY.  This technology is considered to be on the 
flat-portion of the learning curve and is applicable only to engines with overhead cam 
configurations.   The agencies have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 to this 
technology through 2018 and 1.29 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-26.

3.4.1.5.2 Continuously Variable Valve Lift (CVVL) 
In CVVL systems, valve lift is varied by means of a mechanical linkage, driven by an 
actuator controlled by the engine control unit.  The valve opening and phasing vary as the lift 
is changed and the relation depends on the geometry of the mechanical system.  BMW has 
considerable production experience with CVVL systems and has sold port-injected 
“Valvetronic” engines since 2001.  Fiat is now offering “MultiAir” engines enabling precise 
control over intake valve lift.  CVVL allows the airflow into the engine to be regulated by 
means of intake valve opening reduction, which improves engine efficiency by reducing 
pumping losses from throttling the intake system further upstream as with a conventionally 
throttled engine. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-82 
 
Variable valve lift gives a further reduction in pumping losses compared to that which 
can be obtained with cam phase control only, with CVVL providing greater effectiveness than 
DVVL, since it can be fully optimized for all engine speeds and loads, and is not limited to a 
two or three step compromise.  There may also be a small reduction in valvetrain friction 
when operating at low valve lift, resulting in improved low load fuel consumption for cam 
phase control with variable valve lift as compared to cam phase control only.  Most of the fuel 
economy effectiveness is achieved with variable valve lift on the intake valves only.  CVVL 
is only applicable to double overhead cam (DOHC) engines. 
The 2012-2016 final rule estimated the effectiveness for CVVL at 1.5 to 3.5 percent 
over an engine with DCP, but also recognize that it could go up as high as 5 percent above 
and beyond DCP to account for the implementation of more complex CVVL systems such as 
BMW’s “Valvetronic” and Fiat “MultiAir” engines.  Thus, the effectiveness range for CVVL 
in this joint TSD ranges from 1.5 to 7 percent depending on the complexity level of the 
application.  NHTSA and EPA believe this estimate continues to be applicable for this 
proposal. 
For this rulemaking, NHTSA has increased the incremental effectiveness values for 
this technology to a range of 3.6 to 4.9 percent from 1.5 to 3.5 percent in the MYs 20120-
2016 final rule.  
In the 2012-2016 rule and the 2010 TAR, the agencies estimated the DMC of CVVL 
at $174 (2007$), $320 (2007$), $349 (2007$), $866 (2007$) and $947 (2007$) for an OHC-
I4, OHC-V6, OHC-V8, OHV-V6 and OHV-V8 engine, respectively.  These DMCs become 
$180 (2009$), $330 (2009$), $360 (2009$), $893 (2009$) and $977 (2009$) for this analysis 
all of which are considered applicable in the 2015MY.  This technology is considered to be on 
the flat-portion of the learning curve.   The agencies have applied a medium complexity ICM

3.4.1.6 Variable Valve Actuation (VVA) 
For this proposal, NHTSA has combined two valve control technologies for OHV 
engines. Coupled cam phasing (CCPO) and discrete valve lift (DVVLO) into one technology 
defined as variable valve actuation (VVA). The agency estimates the incremental 
effectiveness for VVA applied to and OHV engine as 2.71 to 3.59 percent. This effectiveness 
value is slightly lower than coupled cam phasing for overhead cam applications (CCPS) based 
on the assumption that VVA would be applied to an OHV engine after cylinder deactivation 
(DEAC). For more information on combining these technologies please refer to the NHTSA 
specific Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA). 
3.4.1.7 Stoichiometric Gasoline Direct Injection (SGDI) 
Stoichiometric gasoline direct injection (SGDI), or Spark Ignition Direct injection 
(SIDI), engines inject fuel at high pressure directly into the combustion chamber (rather than 
the intake port in port fuel injection).  SGDI requires changes to the injector design, an 
additional high pressure fuel pump, new fuel rails to handle the higher fuel pressures and 
changes to the cylinder head and piston crown design.  Direct injection of the fuel into the 
cylinder improves cooling of the air/fuel charge within the cylinder, which allows for higher 
compression ratios and increased thermodynamic efficiency without the onset of combustion 
knock.  Recent injector design advances, improved electronic engine management systems 
and the introduction of multiple injection events per cylinder firing cycle promote better 
mixing of the air and fuel, enhance combustion rates, increase residual exhaust gas tolerance 
and improve cold start emissions.  SGDI engines achieve higher power density and match 
well with other technologies, such as boosting and variable valvetrain designs. 
Several manufacturers are manufacturing vehicles with SGDI engines, including 
VW/Audi, BMW, Toyota (Lexus IS 350), Ford (Ecoboost), and General Motors (Chevrolet 
Impala and Cadillac CTS 3.6L). BMW, GM, Ford and VW/Audi have announced their plans 
to increase dramatically the number of SGDI engines in their portfolios. 
NHTSA and EPA reviewed estimates from the 2012-2016 final rule and TAR, which 
stated an effectiveness range of SGDI to be between 2 and 3 percent.  NHTSA and EPA 
reviewed estimates from the Alliance of Automobile Manufactures, which projects 3 percent 
gains in fuel efficiency and a 7 percent improvement in torque.  The torque increase provides 
the opportunity to downsize the engine allowing an increase in efficiency of up to a 5.8 
percent.  NHTSA and EPA also reviewed other published literature, reporting 3 percent 
effectiveness for SGDI.36  Confidential manufacturer data reported an efficiency effectiveness 
range of 1 to 2 percent.  Based on data from the recent Ricardo study and reconfiguration of 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-84 
 
the new lumped parameter model, EPA and NHTSA have revised this value to 1.5 percentw.  
Combined with other technologies (i.e., boosting, downsizing, and in some cases, cooled 
EGR), SGDI can achieve greater reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions 
compared to engines of similar power output.    
The NHTSA and EPA cost estimates for SGDI take into account the changes required 
to the engine hardware, engine electronic controls, ancillary and Noise Vibration and 
Harshness (NVH) mitigation systems.  Through contacts with industry NVH suppliers, and 
manufacturer press releases, the agencies believe that the NVH treatments will be limited to 
the mitigation of fuel system noise, specifically from the injectors and the fuel lines and have 
included corresponding cost estimates for these NVH controls.  In the 2012-2016 FRM, the 
agencies estimated the DMC for SGDI at $213 (2007$), $321 (2007$) and $386 (2007$) for 
I3/I4, V6 and V8 engines, respectively. These DMCs become $220 (2009$), $331 (2009$) 
and $398 (2009$) for this analysis all of which are considered applicable in the 2012MY.  
This technology is considered to be on the flat-portion of the learning curve.   The agencies 
have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 to this technology through 2018 and 1.29 
thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-28.

3.4.1.8 Turbocharging and Downsizing (TRBDS) 
The specific power of a naturally aspirated engine is primarily limited by the rate at 
which the engine is able to draw air into the combustion chambers.  Turbocharging and 
supercharging (grouped together here as boosting) are two methods to increase the intake 
manifold pressure and cylinder charge-air mass above naturally aspirated levels.  Boosting 
increases the airflow into the engine, thus increasing the specific power level, and with it the 
ability to reduce engine displacement while maintaining performance.  This effectively 
reduces the pumping losses at lighter loads in comparison to a larger, naturally aspirated 
engine.

 However, because GDI is a key enabler for modern, highly downsized turbocharged engines, this difference 
will be overshadowed by the higher effectiveness for turbocharging and downsizing when they are combined 
into packages.

Almost every major manufacturer currently markets a vehicle with some form of 
boosting.  While boosting has been a common practice for increasing performance for several 
decades, turbocharging has considerable potential to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 
emissions when the engine displacement is also reduced.  Specific power levels for a boosted 
engine often exceed 100 hp/L, compared to average naturally aspirated engine power densities 
of roughly 70 hp/L.  As a result, engines can be downsized roughly 30 percent or higher while 
maintaining similar peak output levels.  In the last decade, improvements to turbocharger 
turbine and compressor design have improved their reliability and performance across the 
entire engine operating range.  New variable geometry turbines and ball-bearing center 
cartridges allow faster turbocharger spool-up (virtually eliminating the once-common “turbo 
lag”) while maintaining high flow rates for increased boost at high engine speeds.  Low speed 
torque output has been dramatically improved for modern turbocharged engines. However, 
even with turbocharger improvements, maximum engine torque at very low engine speed 
conditions, for example launch from standstill, is increased less than at mid and high engine 
speed conditions.  The potential to downsize engines may be less on vehicles with low 
displacement to vehicle mass ratios for example a very small displacement engine in a vehicle 
with significant curb weight, in order to provide adequate acceleration from standstill, 
particularly up grades or at high altitudes.   
Use of GDI systems with turbocharged engines and air-to-air charge air cooling also 
reduces the fuel octane requirements for knock limited combustion and allows the use of 
higher compression ratios.  Ford’s “Ecoboost” downsized, turbocharged GDI engines 
introduced on MY 2010 vehicles allow the replacement of V8 engines with V6 engines with 
improved in 0-60 mph acceleration and with fuel economy improvements of up to 12 
percent.37 
Recently published data with advanced spray-guided injection systems and more 
aggressive engine downsizing targeted towards reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions 
reductions indicate that the potential for reducing CO2 emissions for turbocharged, downsized 
GDI engines may be as much as 15 to 30 percent relative to port-fuel-injected 
engines.14,15,16,17,18  Confidential manufacturer data suggests an incremental range of fuel 
consumption and CO2 emission reduction of 4.8 to 7.5 percent for turbocharging and 
downsizing.  Other publicly-available sources suggest a fuel consumption and CO2 emission 
reduction of 8 to 13 percent compared to current-production naturally-aspirated engines 
without friction reduction or other fuel economy technologies: a joint technical paper by 
Bosch and Ricardo suggesting fuel economy gain of 8 to 10 percent for downsizing from a 5.7 
liter port injection V8 to a 3.6 liter V6 with direct injection using a wall-guided direct 
injection system;38 a Renault report suggesting a 11.9 percent NEDC fuel consumption gain 
for downsizing from a 1.4 liter port injection in-line 4-cylinder engine to a 1.0 liter in-line 4-
cylinder engine, also with wall-guided direct injection;39 and a Robert Bosch paper suggesting 
a 13 percent NEDC gain for downsizing to a turbocharged DI engine, again with wall-guided 
injection.40  These reported fuel economy benefits show a wide range depending on the SGDI 
technology employed.

NHTSA and EPA reviewed estimates from the 2012-2016 final rule, the TAR, and 
existing public literature.  The previous estimate from the MYs 2012-2016 suggested a 12 to 
14 percent effectiveness improvement, which included low friction lubricant (level one), 
engine friction reduction (level one), DCP, DVVL and SGDI, over baseline fixed-valve 
engines, similar to the estimate for Ford’s Ecoboost engine, which is already in production.  
Additionally, the agencies analyzed Ricardo vehicle simulation data for various turbocharged 
engine packages.  Based on this data, and considering the widespread nature of the public 
estimates, the effectiveness of turbocharging and downsizing is highly dependent upon 
implementation and degree of downsizing.   
In alignment with these variances, for this proposal the agencies evaluated 4 different 
levels of downsized and turbocharged high Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP)x. engines; 
18-bar, 24-bar, 24-bar with cooled  exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and 27-bar with cooled 
EGR   All engines are assumed to include gasoline direct injection (SGDI) and effectiveness 
values include the benefits of this technology. In addition, the agencies believe to implement 
in production a 27 bar boost level, it is necessary to incorporate cooled exhaust gas 
recirculation (EGR) and also require a 2-stage turbocharger as well as engine changes to 
increase robustness.  The cooled EGR technology is discussed later in this section. 
NHTSA and EPA have revised the effectiveness to reflect this new information and 
assume that turbocharging and downsizing, alone, will provide a 12 to 24.6 percent 
effectiveness improvement (dependent upon degree of downsizing and boost levels) over 
naturally aspirated, fixed-valve engines. More specifically, 12.1 to 14.9 percent for 18-bar 
engines, which is equal to the boost levels evaluated in the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, 
assuming 33 percent downsizing, 16.4 to 20.1 percent for 24-bar engines, assuming 50 
percent downsizing, 19.3 to 23.0 percent for 24-bar engines with cooled EGR, assuming 50 
percent downsizing and 20.6 to 24.6 percent for 27-bar engines with cooled EGR, assuming 
56 percent downsizing.  For comparison purposes an 18-bar engine with low friction lubricant 
(level one), engine friction reduction (level one), DCP, DVVL and SGDI, which is equivalent 
to MYs 2012-2016 assumed turbocharging and downsizing technology, now results in a 16.8 
to 20.9 percent effectiveness improvement.  Coupling turbocharging and downsizing with low 
friction lubricant (level one and two), engine friction reductions (level one and two), DCP, 
DVVL and SGDI, for the MYs 2017-2025 timeframe, yields 18.0 to 22.4 percent for 18-bar 
engines 20.4 to 25.2 percent for 24-bar engines, 23.2 to 27.9 percent for 24-bar engine with 
cooled EGR and 24.0 to 28.8 percent for 27-bar with cooled EGR over naturally aspirated, 
fixed-valve engines.

 Brake Mean Effective Pressure is the average amount of pressure in pounds per square inch (psi) that must be 
exerted on the piston to create the measured horsepower. This indicates how effective an engine is at filling the 
combustion chamber with an air/fuel mixture, compressing it and achieving the most power from it. A higher 
BMEP value contributes to higher overall efficiency.

As noted above, the agencies relied on engine teardown analyses conducted by EPA, 
FEV and Munro to develop costs for turbocharged GDI engines.41  In the 2012-2016 FRM, 
the agencies estimated the DMC for turbocharging to 18 bar BMEP at $404 (2007$) and $681 
(2007$) for I4 and V6/V8 engines, respectively, where the higher cost for the V-configuration 
engines represents twin turbochargers versus the single turbocharger in the I-configuration 
engine.  These DMCs become $417 (2009$) and $702 (2009$), respectively, for this analysis.  
In the 2010 TAR, the agencies presented costs for 24 bar BMEP turbocharging at 1.5x the 
cost of the 18 bar BMEP technology.  This additional cost covered the incremental cost 
increase of a variable geometry turbocharger (see 2010 TAR at page B-12).  Thus, the DMC 
for 24 bar BMEP would be $625 (2009$) and $1,053 (2009$) for I-configuration and V-
configuration engines, respectively.  Note also for this proposal, the agencies are estimating 
the DMC of the 27 bar BMEP technology at 2.5x the 18 bar BMEP technology, or $1,042 
(2009$) and $1,756 (2009$) for I-configuration and V-configuration engines, respectively. All 
of these turbocharger-related DMCs are considered applicable in the 2012MY.  The agencies 
consider each turbocharger technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have 
applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2018 for 18 bar and through 2024 for 24 
and 27 bar, then 1.29 to each thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-29.

The costs for the downsizing portion of the turbo/downsize technology is more 
complex.  The agencies have described those cost and how they were developed—based 
primarily on FEV teardowns but some were scaled based on teardowns to generate costs for 
downsizing situations that were not covered by teardowns—in both the 2012-2016 FRM and 
the 2010 TAR.  The DMCs used for this analysis are identical to those used in the 2010 TAR 
except that they have been updated to 2009 dollars.  Notable is the fact that many of the 
downsizing costs are negative because they result in fewer parts and less material than the 
engine from which they are “derived.”  For example a V8 engine could be replaced by a

3-88 
 
turbocharged V6 engine having two fewer cylinders and as many as eight fewer valves (in the 
case of a V8 DOHC downsized to a V6 DOHC).  Importantly, the agencies have used an 
approach to calculating indirect costs that results in positive indirect costs regardless of 
whether the DMC is positive or negative.  This is done by calculating indirect costs based on 
the absolute value of the DMC, then adding the indirect cost to the DMC to arrive at the total 
cost.  This way, the agencies are never making a negative DMC “more negative” when 
accounting for the indirect costs.  This approach has been used in the 2012-2016 final rule and 
the 2010 TAR.  Given the history of the downsizing costs used by the agencies, many are 
considered applicable in the 2012MY and many in the 2017MY.y  All are considered to be on 
the flat portion of the learning curve.  The agencies have applied a medium complexity ICM 
of 1.39 through 2018 and 1.29 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-30.

 The engine downsize costs based on actual FEV teardowns were considered applicable to the 2012MY, as was 
explained for some downsize costs in the 2012-2016 final rule and others in the 2010 TAR.  For other downsize 
costs—the two changes from OHV engines to DOHC engines—the agencies did not use FEV teardowns or 
extrapolations from FEV teardowns, and instead used the methodology employed in the 2008 EPA Staff Report, 
a methodology determined by both agencies to result in cost estimates more appropriate for the 2017MY.  The 
new downsize costs—those for V8 engines downsized to I4 engines—use a combination of V8 to V6 then V6 to 
I4 downsize costs and are considered applicable to the 2017MY within the context of this analysis.

downsizing is considered for this analysis only if it also includes 27 bar BMEP turbo boost

All costs are total costs (Direct manufacturing costs + Indirect costs); all costs are incremental to the 
baseline; all resultant engines are DOHC; note that costs are shown for 27 bar BMEP engines with V6 
engines.  In fact, the agencies do not believe that manufacturers will employ 27 bar BMEP technology on V6 
engines to comply with the proposed standards, instead using the additional boost to allow for downsizing 
V6 engines to smaller I4 engines than would be used for 18 bar BMEP or 24 bar BMEP I4 engines and/or 
downsizing V8 engines to I4 engines.  As a result, whenever a 27 bar BMEP engine is chosen by either 
agency’s model, the engine configuration will be an I4 and will include cooled EGR, as discussed in section 
3.4.1.8. 
 
3.4.1.9 Cooled Exhaust-Gas Recirculation (EGR) 
While not considered in the technology packages used for assessing potential 
compliance pathways in the 2012-2016 light-duty rule, the agencies have considered an 
emerging technology referred to as cooled exhaust gas recirculation (cooled-EGR) as applied 
to downsized, turbocharged GDI engines.  In the 2010 TAR, the agencies considered this 
technology as an advanced gasoline technology since it was considered an emerging and not 
yet available technology in the light-duty gasoline market.  While a cooled or “boosted” EGR 
technology was discussed in the 2012-2016 light-duty rule record, the technology considered 
here is comparatively more advanced as described in the 2010 TAR.  As such, the agencies 
have considered new costs and new effectiveness values for it.  The effectiveness values used 
for vehicle packages with cooled EGR within this analysis reflect a conservative estimate of 
system performance at approximately 24-bar BMEP.  Vehicle simulation modeling of 
technology packages using the more highly boosted and downsized cooled EGR engines (up 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-91 
 
to 27-bar BMEP, and utilizing EGR rates of 20-25%) with dual-stage turbocharging has been 
completed as part of EPA’s contract with Ricardo Engineering as described in 3.3.1.2.    For 
this NPRM, the agencies have updated the effectiveness of vehicle packages with cooled EGR 
using the new Ricardo vehicle simulation modeling runs. 
Cooled exhaust gas recirculation or Boosted EGR is a combustion concept that 
involves utilizing EGR as a charge diluent for controlling combustion temperatures and 
cooling the EGR prior to its introduction to the combustion system.  Higher exhaust gas 
residual levels at part load conditions reduce pumping losses for increased fuel economy.  The 
additional charge dilution enabled by cooled EGR reduces the incidence of knocking 
combustion and obviates the need for fuel enrichment at high engine power.  This allows for 
higher boost pressure and/or compression ratio and further reduction in engine displacement 
and both pumping and friction losses while maintaining performance.  Engines of this type 
use GDI and both dual cam phasing and discrete variable valve lift.  The EGR systems 
considered in this proposal would use a dual-loop system with both high and low pressure 
EGR loops and dual EGR coolers.  The engines would also use single-stage, variable 
geometry turbocharging with higher intake boost pressure available across a broader range of 
engine operation than conventional turbocharged SI engines.  Such a system is estimated to be 
capable of an additional 3 to 5 percent effectiveness relative to a turbocharged, downsized 
GDI engine without cooled-EGR.42,43  The agencies have also considered a more advanced 
version of such a cooled EGR system that employs very high combustion pressures by using 
dual stage turbocharging.  This modeling work has been completed by Ricardo Engineering.  
The simulation modeling is similar to work that Ricardo conducted for EPA for its 2008 staff 
report on GHG effectiveness of light-duty vehicle technologies.44 The agencies have 
considered this more advanced cooled EGR approach for this proposal.   
For the MYs 2012-2016 final rule and TAR, NHTSA and EPA assumed a  5 
percent fuel consumption effectiveness for cooled EGR compared to a conventional 
downsized DI turbocharged engine. 45 46  Based on the data from the Ricardo and Lotus 
reports, NHTSA and EPA estimate the incremental reduction in fuel consumption for 
EGR Boost to be 5 percent over a turbocharged and downsized DI engine.  Thus, if 
cooled EGR is applied to 24-bar engine, adding the 19.3 percent from the turbocharging 
and downsizing to the 5 percent gain from cooled EGR results in total fuel consumption 
reduction of 22.1 percent.  This is in agreement with the range suggested in the Lotus 
and Ricardo reports. 
In the 2010 TAR, the agencies estimated the DMC of the cooled EGR system at $240 
(2007$, see 2010 TAR at page B-12)).  This DMC becomes $242 (2009$) for this analysis.  
This DMC is considered applicable in the 2012MY.  The agencies consider cooled EGR 
technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a medium 
complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2024 then 1.29 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in 
Table 3-32.

 Note that, in the 2010 TAR, the agencies presented the cooled EGR system costs 
inclusive of turbo charging costs (see 2010 TAR, Table B2.2-1 at page B-12).  For this 
analysis, the agencies are presenting the cooled EGR costs as a stand-alone technology that 
can be added to any turbo/downsized engine provided sufficient boost is provided and 
sufficient engine robustness is accounted for.  As such, the cooled EGR system is considered 
applicable only the 24 bar BMEP and 27 bar BMEP engines.  Further, the agencies believe 
that 24 bar BMEP engines are capable of maintaining NOx control without cooled EGR, so 
each agency’s respective models may choose 24 bar BMEP engines with and/or without 
cooled EGR.  However, as noted above, 27 bar BMEP engines are considered to require 
cooled EGR to maintain NOx emission control.  As such, neither agency’s model is allowed 
to choose 27 bar BMEP technology without also adding cooled EGR. 
3.4.1.10 Diesel Engine Technology (DSL) 
Diesel engines have several characteristics that give them superior fuel efficiency 
compared to conventional gasoline, spark-ignited engines.  Pumping losses are much lower 
due to lack of (or greatly reduced) throttling in a diesel engine.  The diesel combustion cycle 
operates at a higher compression ratio than does a gasoline engine.  As a result, turbocharged 
light-duty diesels typically achieve much higher torque levels at lower engine speeds than 
equivalent-displacement naturally-aspirated gasoline engines.  Future high BMEP 
turbocharged and downsized engines, mentioned above, are projected to improve torque 
levels at lower engine speeds thus reducing the diesel advantage in this area.  Diesels also 
operate with a very lean air/fuel mixture.  These attributes – reduced pumping losses, higher 
compression ratio and lean/air fuel mixture -- allow the engine to extract more energy from a 
given mass of fuel than a gasoline engine, and thus make it more efficient.  Additionally, 
diesel fuel has higher energy content per gallon than does gasoline.  While diesel fuel has a 
higher energy content than gasoline, it also contains more carbon per gallon than does 
gasoline:  diesel produces 22.2 pounds of CO2 per gallon when burned, while gasoline 
produces 19.4 pounds of CO2 per gallon.  This higher carbon content slightly offsets the GHG 
emissions benefit of diesel fuel relative to gasoline, however, the disbenefit is more than 
compensated by the greater efficiency of the diesel engine.  Since diesel engines are more fuel 
efficient than current naturally aspirated PFI gasoline engines, the agencies anticipate that 
manufacturers will evaluate and potentially invest in diesel engine production as a way to 
comply with more stringent CAFE standards.  However, there are two primary reasons why 
manufacturers might not choose to invest significantly in diesel engine technologies as a way 
to comply with the CAFE and GHG standards for MYs 2017-2025. 
As discussed above, even though diesel has higher energy content than gasoline it also 
has a higher carbon density that results in higher amounts of CO2 emitted per gallon, 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-93 
 
approximately 15 percent more than a gallon of gasoline.  This is commonly referred to as the 
“carbon penalty” associated with using diesel fuel – a diesel vehicle yields greater fuel 
economy improvements compared to its CO2 emissions reduction improvements, so a 
manufacturer that invests in diesel technology to meet CAFE standards may have more 
trouble meeting the GHG standards than if it used a different and more cost effective (from a 
GHG perspective) technology. 
And second, diesel engines also have emissions characteristics that present challenges 
to meeting federal Tier 2 NOx emissions standards.  By way of comparison for readers 
familiar with the European on-road fleet, which contains many more diesel vehicles than the 
U.S. on-road fleet, U.S. Tier 2 emissions fleet average requirement of bin 5 require roughly 
45 to 65 percent more NOx reduction compared to the Euro VI standards.   
Despite considerable advances by manufacturers in developing Tier 2-compliant diesel 
engines, it remains somewhat of a systems-engineering challenge to maintain the full fuel 
consumption advantage of the diesel engine while meeting Tier 2 emissions regulations 
because some of the emissions reduction strategies can increase fuel consumption (relative to 
a Tier 1 compliant diesel engine), depending on the combination of strategies employed.  A 
combination of combustion improvements (that reduce NOX emissions leaving the engine) 
and aftertreatment (capturing and reducing NOX emissions via a NOx adsorption catalyst, or 
via selective catalytic reduction (SCR) using a reductant such as urea) that have left the 
engine before they leave the vehicle tailpipe) are being introduced on Tier 2 compliant light-
duty diesel vehicles today.  However, recently there have been a small number of 
announcements that diesel engines will be added to some passenger cars, in some cases a 
segment first for a manufacturer47, or that new passenger car diesel engines are being 
designed to meet all global emissions regulations.48  This suggests to the agencies that some 
manufacturers may be planning to use diesel engines in their plans to meet the tighter CAFE 
standards in the mid-term, which may be enabled by advances in diesel engine and emission 
control technology.  Manufacturers that focus on diesel engines have also stated to the 
agencies their expectation that diesel engines will continue to be a viable technology for 
improving fuel economy and GHG emissions in the future. 
We spend time here discussing available emissions reduction technologies for diesel 
engines as part of this rulemaking because of the potential they have to impact fuel economy 
and GHG emissions for the vehicles that have them.  With respect to combustion 
improvements, we note that several key advances in diesel engine combustion technology 
have made it possible to reduce emissions coming from the engine prior to aftertreatment, 
which reduces the need for aftertreatment.  These technologies include improved fuel systems 
(higher injection pressure and multiple-injection capability), advanced controls and sensors to 
optimize combustion and emissions performance, higher EGR levels and EGR cooling to 
reduce NOx, and advanced turbocharging systems.  These systems are available today and 
they do not adversely impact fuel efficiency.  However, additional improvements in these 
technologies will be needed to reduce engine emissions further, should future emissions 
standards become more stringent.  Further development may also be needed to reduce the fuel 
efficiency penalty associated with EGR. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-94 
 
With respect to catalytic exhaust emission control systems, typical 3-way exhaust 
catalysts without NOx storage capability are not able to reduce NOx emissions from engines 
operated lean of stoichiometry (diesel or lean-burn gasoline)=.  To reduce NOx, 
hydrocarbons, and particulate emissions, all diesels will require a catalyzed diesel particulate 
filter (CDPF) and sometimes a separate diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), and either a lean 
NOx trap (LNT) z or the use of a selective catalytic reduction system, typically base-metal 
zeolite urea-SCRaa.   
The increased cost of diesel emissions control technologies relative to powertrains 
with stoichiometric gasoline engines that are approaching comparable efficiency may also 
make diesels less attractive to manufacturers as a technology solution for more stringent 
CAFE and GHG standards.  However, recognizing that some manufacturers may still employ 
diesel technology to meet the future standards, the agencies have included diesels in our 
analysis as follows: 
The agencies sought to ensure that diesel engines would have equivalent performance 
to comparable gasoline engine vehicles.  For the Subcompact, Compact, and Midsize 
Passenger Car, Performance Subcompact Car, and Small Light Truck vehicle subclasses, the 
agencies assumed that an I4 gasoline base engine would be replaced by an in-line 4-cylinder 
diesel engine with displacement varying around 2.0 liters.  For the Performance Compact, 
Performance Midsize, Large Passenger Car, Minivan, and Midsize Truck vehicle subclasses 
for the CAFE model, the agencies assumed that a V6 gasoline base engine would be replaced 
by an in-line 4-cylinder diesel engine with displacement varying around 2.8 liters.   For the 
Large Truck and Performance Large Car vehicle subclasses for the CAFE model, the agencies 
assumed that a V8 gasoline base engine would be replaced with a V6 diesel engine with 
                                                 
z
 A lean NOx trap operates= by oxidizing NO to NO2 in the exhaust and storing NO2 on alkali sorbent material, 
most often BaO.   When the control system determines (via mathematical model and typicalla NOx sensor) that 
the trap is saturated with NOx, it switches the engine into a operating mode just rich of stoichiometry that allow 
NOx to be released from the alkali storage and temporarily allow three-way function of the catalyst similar to 
three-way catalysts used in stoichiometric gasoline applications.  LNTs preferentially store sulfate compounds 
from the fuel, whichreduces NOx storage capacity over time, thus the system must undergo periodic 
desulfurization by operating at a net-fuel-rich condition at high temperatures in order to retain NOx trapping 
efficiency. 
aa
 An SCR aftertreatment system uses a reductant (typically, ammonia derived from urea) that is injected into the 
exhaust stream ahead of the SCR catalyst.  Ammonia is a strong reductant even under net lean conditions. It 
combines with NOx in the SCR catalyst to form N2 and water.  The hardware configuration for an SCR system is 
sometimes more complicated than that of an LNT, due to the onboard urea storage and delivery system (which 
requires a urea pump and injector to inject urea into the exhaust stream), which generally makes an SCR system 
cost more than an LNT system.  While a rich engine-operating mode is not required for NOx reduction, the urea 
is typically injected at a rate of approximately 3 percent of the fuel consumed.  The agencies understand that 
manufacturers designing SCR systems intend to align urea tank refills with standard maintenance practices such 
as oil changes as more diesel vehicles are introduced into the market.  For diesel vehicles currently on the 
market, this is generally already the practice, and represents an ongoing maintenance cost for vehicles with this 
technology.

displacement varying around 4.0 liters to meet vehicle performance requirements.  It was also 
assumed that diesel engines for all of these classes would utilize SCR aftertreatment systems 
given recent improvements in zeolite-based SCR systems and system efficiency.  These 
assumptions impacted our estimates of the costs of implementing diesel engines as compared 
to the base gasoline engines. 
Diesel engines are more costly than port-injected spark-ignition gasoline engines.  
These higher costs result from more costly components, more complex systems for emissions 
control, and other factors.  The vehicle systems that are impacted include: 
• Fuel systems (higher pressures and more responsive injectors); 
• Controls and sensors to optimize combustion and emissions performance; 
• Engine design (higher cylinder pressures require a more robust engine, but higher 
torque output means diesel engines can have reduced displacement); 
• Turbocharger(s); 
• Aftertreatment systems, which tend to be more costly for diesels; 
In the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies estimated the DMC for converting a 
gasoline PFI engine with 3-way catalyst aftertreatment to a diesel engine with diesel 
aftertreatment at $1,697 (2007$), $2,399 (2007$), $1,956 (2007$) and $2,676 (2007$) for a 
small car, large car, medium/large MPV & small truck, and large truck, respectively (see final 
Joint TSD, Table 3-12 at page 3-44).  All of these costs were for SCR-based diesel systems, 
with the exception of the small car, which was a LNT-based system.  For this proposal, we are 
using the same methodology as used in the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, but have made four 
primary changes to the cost estimates.  First, the agencies have not estimated costs for a LNT-
based system, and instead have estimated costs for all vehicle types assuming they will 
employ SCR-based systems.  Second, the agencies assumed that manufacturers would meet a 
Tier 2 bin 2 average rather than a Tier 2 bin 5 average, assuming that more stringent levels of 
compliance will be required in the future.  In order to estimate costs for Tier 2 bin 2 compliant 
vehicles, catalyst volume costs were estimated based on an assumed increase in volume of 20 
percent.  This was the estimated necessary increase needed to meet Tier 2, bin 2 emission 
level of 0.02 grams of NOx per mile.  Increased catalyst volume resulted in a higher cost 
estimate for diesel aftertreatment than was estimated for the MYs 2012-2016 final rule.  The 
third is to update all platinum group metal costs from the March 2009 values used in the 
2012-2016 final rule to February 2011 values.bb  The February 2011 values were used for

 As reported by Johnson-Matthey, the March 2009 monthly average costs were $1,085 per Troy ounce and 
$1,169 per Troy ounce for platinum (Pt) and rhodium (Rh), respectively.  As also reported by Johnson-Matthey, 
the February 2011 monthly average costs were $1,829 per Troy ounce and $2,476 per Troy ounce for Pt and Rh, 
respectively.  See www.platinum.matthey.com.

purposes of this NPRM analysis because they represented the most recent monthly average 
prices available at the time the agencies “locked-down” all cost estimates for the purposes of 
moving into the modeling phase of analysis.cc  The forth is to include an additional $50 DMC 
for all costs to cover costs associated with improvements to fuel and urea controls.  All of the 
diesel costs are considered applicable to MY 2012.  The agencies consider diesel technology 
to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a medium complexity ICM of 
1.39 through 2018, and then an ICM of 1.29 thereafter. The resultant costs are shown in Table 
3-33.

For the MYs 2012-016 final rule and TAR, NHTSA and EPA estimated the fuel 
consumption reduction of a SCR-based diesel engine to be between 20 to 25 percent over a 
baseline gasoline engine.  NHTSA and EPA have revisited these values and have now 
estimated, based on the Ricardo 2011 study, the effectiveness of a SCR-based diesel engine to 
be 28.4 to 30.5 percent.  For purposes of CO2 reduction, EPA estimates a 7 to 20 percent for 
light-duty diesels equipped with SCR.

 Note that there is no good way of determining what PGM prices to use when conducting cost analyses.  Spot 
prices are inherently dangerous to use because spot prices, like stock prices on the stock market, can vary 
considerably from day to day.  One could argue that an average price is best, but average prices can vary 
considerably depending on the length of time included in the average.  And if too much time is included in the 
average, then average prices from a time prior to PGM use in diesel engines may be included which would lead 
some to conclude that we had cherry picked our values.  Given no good option, it seems most transparent and 
least self serving to simply choose a price and report its basis.  In the end, the PGM costs represent 16-23 percent 
of the diesel DMC in this analysis.  Further, diesels play very little to no role in enabling compliance with the 
proposed standards.

3.4.2 Transmission Technologies 
NHTSA and EPA have also reviewed the transmission technology estimates used in 
the 2012-2016 final rule and the 2010 TAR.  In doing so, NHTSA and EPA considered or 
reconsidered all available sources and updated the estimates as appropriate.  The section 
below describes each of the transmission technologies considered for this rulemaking. 
3.4.2.1 Improved Automatic Transmission Control (Aggressive Shift Logic and 
Early Torque Converter Lockup) 
Calibrating the transmission shift schedule to upshift earlier and quicker, and to lock-
up or partially lock-up the torque converter under a broader range of operating conditions can 
reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.  However, this operation can result in a 
perceptible degradation in noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH).  The degree to which NVH 
can be degraded before it becomes noticeable to the driver is strongly influenced by 
characteristics of the vehicle, and although it is somewhat subjective, it always places a limit 
on how much fuel consumption can be improved by transmission control changes.  
Aggressive Shift Logic and Early Torque Converter Lockup are best optimized 
simultaneously when added to an automatic transmission due to the fact that adding both of 
them requires only minor modifications to the transmission mechanical components or 
calibration software.  As a result, these two technologies are combined in the modeling when 
added to an automatic transmission.  Since a dual clutch transmission (DCT) has no torque 
converter, the early torque converter lockup technology is not included when adding ASL to 
the DCT. 
3.4.2.2 Aggressive Shift Logic 
During operation, a transmission’s controller manages the operation of the 
transmission by scheduling the upshift or downshift, and, in automatic transmissions, locking 
or allowing the torque converter to slip based on a preprogrammed shift schedule.  The shift 
schedule contains a number of lookup table functions, which define the shift points and torque 
converter lockup based on vehicle speed and throttle position, and other parameters such as 
temperature.  Aggressive shift logic (ASL) can be employed in such a way as to maximize 
fuel efficiency by modifying the shift schedule to upshift earlier and inhibit downshifts under 
some conditions, which reduces engine pumping losses and engine friction.  The application 
of this technology does require a manufacturer to confirm that drivability, durability, and 
NVH are not significantly degraded. 
For this proposal, the agencies are considering two levels of ASL.  The first level is 
that discussed in the 2012-2016 final rule and the 2010 TAR.  ASL-level 1 is an early upshift 
strategy whereby the transmission shifts to the next higher gear “earlier” (or at lower RPM 
during a gradual acceleration) than would occur in a traditional automatic transmission.  This 
early upshift reduces fuel consumption by allowing the engine to operate at a lower RPM and 
higher load, which typically moves the engine into a more efficient operating region.

3-98 
 
ASL-level 2 is a shift optimization strategy whereby the engine and/or transmission 
controller(s) continuously evaluate all possible gear options that would provide the necessary 
tractive power (while limiting the adverse effects on driveline NVH) and select the gear that 
lets the engine run in the most efficient operating zone.  Ricardo acknowledged in its report 
that the ASL-level 2 (“shift optimization”) strategy currently causes significant implications 
for drivability and hence affects consumer acceptability.  However, Ricardo recommended the 
inclusion of this technology for the 2020-2025 time frame with the assumption that 
manufacturers will develop a means of yielding the fuel economy benefit without adversely 
affecting driver acceptability.  The agencies believe these drivability challenges could include 
shift business – that is, a high level of shifting compared to current vehicles as perceived by 
the customers.  The agencies note that in confidential discussions with two major transmission 
suppliers, the suppliers described transmission advances which reduce shifting time and 
provide smoother torque transitions than today’s designs, making the shifting event less 
apparent to the driver, however these improvements will not influence the customer’s 
perception of shift business related to the changes in engine speed. 
In addition, the agencies note that several auto companies and transmission firms have 
announced future introduction of transmissions into the U.S. market with even a higher 
number of gears than were included in the Ricardo simulation and in the agencies’ feasibility 
assessment for this proposal (which is 8 forward speeds).  These announcements include both 
9 and 10 speed transmissions which may present further challenges with shift business, given 
the availability of one or two additional gears.  At the same time, the associated closer gear 
spacing will generally result in smaller engine speed changes during shifting that may be less 
noticeable to the driver.   
The agencies are including shift optimization in the analysis under the premise that 
manufacturers and suppliers are developing means to mitigate these drivability issues by MY 
2017, as assumed in the 2011 Ricardo study (more information on Ricardo’s treatment of the 
optimized shift strategy is described in Section 6.4 of the 2011 Ricardo report).  If 
manufacturers are not able to solve these drivability issues, the assumed effectiveness could 
be lower and the cost could be higher or both. The agencies are seeking comment on the 
feasibility of ASL-level 2 and the likelihood that manufacturers will be able to overcome the 
drivability issues. 
In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies estimated an effectiveness improvement of 
1 to 2 percent for aggressive shift logic which was supported by the 2002 NAS and 
NESCCAF reports as well as confidential manufacturer data.  The agencies updated the 
effectiveness of ASL-level 1 ranging from 1.9 to 2.7 based on 2010 Ricardo study. In CAFE 
model an incremental effectiveness ranging for both ASL and early torque converter lockup 
ranging from 2.3 to 3.1 percent is applied (Early torque converter has effectiveness of 0.5 
percent).    
ASL-level 2 is new to this analysis which is based on the shift optimization algorithm 
in 2011 Ricardo study. The effectiveness for ASL-level 2 ranges from 5.1 to 7.0 percent 
improvement over transmission with unimproved shift logic or roughly 4 to 5 percent over a 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-99 
 
transmission that already incorporates aggressive shift logic.  In the CAFE model, an 
incremental effectiveness ranging from 3.27 to 4.31 percent is applied.  
In the 2012-2016 rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $26 (2007$) which was 
considered applicable to the 2015MY.  This DMC becomes $27 (2009$) for this analysis.  
The agencies consider ASL-level 1 technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve 
and have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2018 then 1.29 thereafter.  For 
ASL-level 2, the agencies are estimating the DMC at an equivalent $27 (2009$) except that 
this cost is considered applicable to the 2017MY.  Essentially this yields a nearly negligible 
incremental cost for ASL-level 2 over ASL-level 1.  The agencies consider ASL-level 2 
technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a medium 
complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2024 then 1.29 thereafter.  The timing of the ASL-level 2 
ICMs is different than that for the level 1 technology because the level 2 technology is newer 
and not yet being implemented in the fleet.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-34.  
Note that both levels of ASL technology are incremental to the baseline system, so ASL-level 
2 is not incremental to ASL-level 1.

3.4.2.3 Early Torque Converter Lockup 
A torque converter is a fluid coupling located between the engine and transmission in 
vehicles with automatic transmissions and continuously-variable transmissions (CVT).  This 
fluid coupling allows for slip so the engine can run while the vehicle is idling in gear (as at a 
stop light), provides for smoothness of the powertrain, and also provides for torque 
multiplication during acceleration, and especially launch.  During light acceleration and 
cruising, the inherent slip in a torque converter causes increased fuel consumption, so modern 
automatic transmissions utilize a clutch in the torque converter to lock it and prevent this 
slippage.  Fuel consumption can be further reduced by locking up the torque converter at 
lower vehicle speeds, provided there is sufficient power to propel the vehicle, and noise and 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

vibration are not excessive.dd  If the torque converter cannot be fully locked up for maximum 
efficiency, a partial lockup strategy can be employed to reduce slippage.  Early torque 
converter lockup is applicable to all vehicle types with automatic transmissions.  Some torque 
converters will require upgraded clutch materials to withstand additional loading and the 
slipping conditions during partial lock-up.  As with aggressive shift logic, confirmation of 
acceptable drivability, performance, durability and NVH characteristics is required to 
successfully implement this technology. 
Regarding the effectiveness of Early Torque Converter Lockup, the 2012-2016 final 
rule, TAR, and the 2010 Ricardo study estimated an effectiveness improvement of 0.4 to 0.5 
percent. 
In the 2012-2016 rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $24 (2007$) which was 
considered applicable to the 2015MY.  This DMC remains $24 (2009$) for this analysis.ee  
The agencies consider early torque converter lockup technology to be on the flat portion of 
the learning curve and have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 
thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-35.

3.4.2.4 High Efficiency Gearbox 
For this rule, a high efficiency gearbox refers to some or all of a suite of incremental 
gearbox improvement technologies that should be available within the 2017 to 2025 
timeframe.  The majority of these improvements address mechanical friction within the 
gearbox.  These improvements include but are not limited to: shifting clutch technology 
improvements (especially for smaller vehicle classes), improved kinematic design, dry sump 
lubrication systems, more efficient seals, bearings and clutches (reducing drag), component 
superfinishing and improved transmission lubricants.  More detailed description can be found 
in the 2011 Ricardo report49.  Note that the high efficiency gearbox technology is applicable 
to any type of transmission. 
                                                 
dd
 Although only modifications to the transmission calibration software are considered as part of this technology, 
very aggressive early torque converter lock up may require an adjustment to damper stiffness and hysteresis 
inside the torque converter. 
ee
 As is true throughout this presentation of cost estimates, the agencies round costs to the nearest dollar.  In the 
actual model input files, the cost in 2007$ would have been $23.68 and the cost in 2009$ is $24.42.  So an 
impact of the dollar-year conversion is reflected in the analysis even when it does not appear so in this 
presentation. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-101 
 
EPA analyzed detailed transmission efficiency input data provided by Ricardo and 
implemented it directly into the lumped parameter model.  Based on the LP effectiveness 
resulting from these inputs, EPA and NHTSA estimate that a high efficiency gearbox can 
provide a GHG or fuel consumption reduction in the range of 3.8 to 5.7 percent (3.8% for 
4WD trucks with an unimproved rear axle) over a baseline automatic transmission in 
MY2017 and beyond.   
The agencies estimate the DMC of the high efficiency gearbox at $200 (2009$).  We 
have based this on the DMC for engine friction reduction in a V8 engine which, as presented 
in Table 3-22 is $193 (2009$). We have rounded this up to $200 for this analysis.  This DMC 
is considered applicable for the 2017MY.  The agencies consider high efficiency gearbox 
technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a low complexity 
ICM of 1.24 through 2024 then 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-36.

3.4.2.5 Automatic 6-, 7- and 8-Speed Transmissions (NAUTO and 8SPD) 
Manufacturers can also choose to replace 4- and 5-speed transmission with 6-, 7-, or 
8-speed automatic transmissions.  Additional ratios allow for further optimization of engine 
operation over a wider range of conditions, but this is subject to diminishing returns as the 
number of speeds increases.  As additional planetary gear sets are added (which may be 
necessary in some cases to achieve the higher number of ratios), additional weight and friction 
are introduced.  Also, the additional shifting of such a transmission can be perceived as 
bothersome to some consumers, so manufacturers need to develop strategies for smooth 
shifts.  Some manufacturers are replacing 4- and 5-speed automatics with 6-speed automatics, 
and 7- and 8-speed automatics have also entered production.  While a six speed transmission 
application was most prevalent for the 2012-2016 final rule, eight speed transmissions are 
expected to be readily available and applied in the 2017 through 2025 timeframe. 
As discussed in the MY 2011 CAFE final rule, confidential manufacturer data 
projected that 6-speed transmissions could incrementally reduce fuel consumption by 0 to 5 
percent from a baseline 4-speed automatic transmission, while an 8-speed transmission could 
incrementally reduce fuel consumption by up to 6 percent from a baseline 4-speed automatic 
transmission.  GM has publicly claimed a fuel economy improvement of up to 4 percent for 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-102 
 
its new 6-speed automatic transmissions.50  The 2008 EPA Staff Technical Report found a 4.5 
to 6.5 percent fuel consumption improvement for a 6-speed over a 4-speed automatic 
transmission.51  Based on this information, NHTSA estimated in the MY 2011 rule, that the 
conversion to a 6-,7- and 8-speed transmission (NAUTO) from a 4 or 5-speed automatic 
transmission with IATC would have an incremental fuel consumption benefit of 1.4 percent to 
3.4 percent, for all vehicle classes.  From a baseline 4 or 5 speed transmission without IATC, 
the incremental fuel consumption benefit would be approximately 3 to 6 percent, which is 
consistent with the EPA Staff Report estimate. In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, NHTSA and 
EPA reviewed these effectiveness estimates and concluded that they remain accurate.  While 
the CAFE model follows the incremental approach discussed above, the GHG model 
estimates the packaged effectiveness of 4.5 to 6.5 percent 
In this NPRM analysis, the agencies divided the improvement for this technology into 
two steps, first from 4 or 5 speed transmission to 6 or 7 speed transmission (NAUTO), then 
from 6 or 7 speed transmission to 8 speed transmission (8SPD). The effectiveness estimates 
for NAUTO and 8SPD are based on 2011 Ricardo study. In this NPRM analysis, the 
effectiveness for a 6-speed transmission relative to a 4-speed base transmission ranges from 
3.1 to 3.9 percent (2.1 percent for large truck with unimproved rear axle) including 7 percent 
of transmission gearbox efficiency improvement that the agencies assumed accompanying the 
new 6 speed transmission after MY 2010. NHTSA incorporated this effectiveness estimate 
into the CAFE model as incremental improvement over IATC ranging from 1.89 to 2.13 
percent. In this NPRM analysis, the agencies assumed that 8-speed transmission will not start 
to phase in until MY2017. NHTSA applied 8-speed automatic transmission succeeding 6-
speed automatic transmission to vehicles with towing requirement, such as Minivan, Midsize 
light truck and large light truck. All other vehicle subclasses use 8-speed DCT to succeed 6-
speed DCT. The effectiveness for an 8-speed DCT relative to a 4-speed DCT transmission 
ranges from 11.1 to 13.1 percent for subcompact car, small car and small light truck. The 
effectiveness for an 8-speed automatic transmission relative to 4-speed automatic 
transmission ranges for large CUV and large truck ranges from 8.7 to 9.2 percent in Lump 
parameter model. This translates into effectiveness in the range of 3.85 to 4.57 percent for an 
8-speed DCT relative to a 6-speed DCT and 4.9 to 5.34 percent for 8-speed automatic 
transmission relative to 6-speed automatic transmission in CAFE model. 
In the 2010 TAR, the agencies estimated the DMC at -$13 (2008$) for a 6 speed 
automatic transmission relative to a 4 speed auto transmission, applicable in the 2017MY (see 
2010 TAR, Table B2.1-1 at page B-10).  For the 2012MY, that DMC was -$15 (2008$), 
although that value was not presented in the TAR.  The latter DMC remains -$15 (2009$) for 
this analysis which is considered to be applicable in the 2012MY.  The agencies consider 6 
speed automatic transmission technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and 
have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant 
costs are shown in Table 3-37. 
New for this analysis is the cost of an 8 speed automatic transmission.  For the cost of 
this technology, the agencies have relied on a tear-down study completed by FEV since 
publication of the TAR.52 In that study, the 8 speed auto transmission was found to be $62 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-103 
 
(2007$) more costly than the 6 speed auto transmission. This DMC becomes $64 (2009$) for 
this analysis.  Adding the $64 (2009$) to the -$15 (2009$) DMC for a 6 speed relative to a 4 
speed, the 8 speed auto transmission relative to a 4 speed auto transmission would be $49 
(2009$).  The agencies consider this DMC to be applicable to the 2012MY.  The agencies 
consider the 8 speed auto transmission technology to be on the flat portion of the learning 
curve and have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through the 2018MY then 1.29 
thereafter.ff   The resultant costs for both 6 speed and 8 speed auto transmissions are shown in 
Table 3-37.

 Note that the cost for the 8 speed automatic transmission relative to the 6 speed 
automatic transmission is lower here than that used in the recent heavy-duty GHG rule.  In 
that rule, we remained consistent with the proposal for that rule which carried an estimated 
DMC of $210 (2008$).  That DMC was based on an estimate derived by NAS (see NAS 
2010, Table 7-10).  For this proposal, we have chosen to use the more recent DMC shown in 
Table 3-37 which is based on a tear-down analysis done by FEV.  
3.4.2.6 Dual Clutch Transmissions / Automated Manual Transmissions 
(DCTAM) 
An Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) is mechanically similar to a conventional 
manual transmission, but shifting and launch functions are automatically controlled by the 
electronics.  There are two basic types of AMTs, single-clutch and dual-clutch (DCT).  A 
single-clutch AMT is essentially a manual transmission with automated clutch and shifting.  
Because of shift quality issues with single-clutch designs, DCTs are far more common in the 
U.S. and are the basis of the estimates that follow.  A DCT uses separate clutches (and 
separate gear shafts) for the even-numbered gears and odd-numbered gears.  In this way, the 
next expected gear is pre-selected, which allows for faster and smoother shifting.  For 
example, if the vehicle is accelerating in third gear, the shaft with gears one, three and five 
has gear three engaged and is transmitting power.  The shaft with gears two, four, and six is 
                                                 
ff
 This ICM would be applied to the 6 speed to 8 speed increment of $64 (2009$) applicable in 2012.  The 4 
speed to 6 speed increment would carry the low complexity ICM. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

idle, but has gear four engaged.  When a shift is required, the controller disengages the odd-
gear clutch while simultaneously engaging the even-gear clutch, thus making a smooth shift.  
If, on the other hand, the driver slows down instead of continuing to accelerate, the 
transmission will have to change to second gear on the idling shaft to anticipate a downshift.  
This shift can be made quickly on the idling shaft since there is no torque being transferred on 
it. 
In addition to single-clutch and dual-clutch AMTs, there are also wet clutch and dry 
clutch designs which are used for different types of vehicle applications.  Wet clutch AMTs 
offer a higher torque capacity that comes from the use of a hydraulic system that cools the 
clutches.  Wet clutch systems are less efficient than the dry clutch systems due to the losses 
associated with hydraulic pumping.  Additionally, wet AMTs have a higher cost due to the 
additional hydraulic hardware required. 
Overall, DCTs likely offer the greatest potential for effectiveness improvements 
among the various transmission options presented in this report because they offer the 
inherently lower losses of a manual transmission with the efficiency and shift quality 
advantages of electronic controls.  The lower losses stem from the elimination of the 
conventional lock-up torque converter, and a greatly reduced need for high pressure hydraulic 
circuits to hold clutches or bands to maintain gear ratios (in automatic transmissions) or hold 
pulleys in position to maintain gear ratio (in Continuously Variable Transmissions).  
However, the lack of a torque converter will affect how the vehicle launches from rest, so a 
DCT will most likely be paired with an engine that offers sufficient torque at low engine 
speeds to allow for adequate launch performance or provide lower launch gears to 
approximate the torque multiplication of the torque converter to provide equivalent 
performance. 
In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, EPA and NHTSA estimated a 5.5 to 9.5 percent improvement 
in fuel consumption over a baseline 4/5-speed automatic transmission for a wet clutch DCT, 
which was assumed for all but the smallest of vehicle subclasses, Subcompact and Compact 
cars and small LT.  This results in an incremental effectiveness estimate of 2.7 to 4.1 percent 
over a 6-speed automatic transmission with IATC.  For Subcompact and Compact Cars and 
small LT, which were assumed to use a dry clutch DCT, NHTSA estimated an 8 to 13 percent 
fuel consumption improvement over a baseline 4/5-speed automatic transmission, which 
equates to a 5.5 to 7.5 percent incremental improvement over the 6-speed transmission.  
Based on the 2011 Ricardo study, EPA and NHTSA have concluded that 8 to 13 percent 
effectiveness is appropriate for 6-speed DCTs and 11 to 16 percent is appropriate for 8-speed 
DCTs for this proposal.  These values include not only the DCT but also the increase in 
stepped gears and also a high efficiency gearbox (mentioned later).  Independent of other 
technologies, this translates to an effectiveness for the DCT, alone, of 4 to 5% (for wet-clutch 
designs) and 5 to 6% (for dry-clutch designs) compared to a baseline automatic transmission 
of similar vintage and number of fixed gears. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-105 
 
In this NPRM analysis, NHTSA applied an incremental effectiveness of 4 percent for a 6-
speed dry DCT and 3.4 to 3.8 percent for a wet DCT compared to a 6-speed automatic 
transmission based on the lumped parameter model which includes the accompanied 
transmission efficiency improvement for MY 2010 and after transmissions. This translates to 
an effectiveness range of 7.4 to 8.6 percent compared to a 4 speed automatic transmission for 
dry clutch design and 7.4 to 7.9 percent for a wet clutch design. NHTSA did not apply DCTs 
to vehicles with towing requirements, such as Minivan, Midsize light truck and large pickup 
truck. EPA did not apply DCTs to vehicle types classified as towing as described in Chapter 1 
of EPA’s Draft RIA. 
In the 2010 TAR, the agencies estimated the DMC at -$234 (2008$) for a 6 speed dry-
clutch DCT and -$165 for a 6 speed wet-clutch DCT with both DMCs applicable in the 
2017MY (see 2010 TAR, Table B2.1-1 at page B-10) and both incremental to a 4 speed 
automatic transmission.  In the 2010 TAR, we pointed to Chapter 3 of the 2012-2016 final 
joint TSD where we noted that the DCT costs of -$147 (2007$ and incremental to a 6-speed 
automatic transmission) were based on a FEV tear-down study that assumed 450,000 units of 
production.  We went on to state that we did not consider there to be sufficient US capacity in 
the 2012-2016 timeframe to produce 450,000 units and for that reason we were adjusting the 
tear-down values accordingly.  The TAR timeframe for consideration was 2017-2025, and in 
the TAR we argued that production capacity would exist and that the FEV tear-down results 
we valid without adjustment.  We continue to believe that to be the case.  In the final joint 
TSD supporting the 2012-2016 rule we also noted that the negative tear-down estimates found 
by FEV were not surprising when considering the relative simplicity of a dual-clutch 
transmission compared to an automatic transmission.  Again, we continue to consider this to 
be true. 
For this analysis, we consider the 2010 TAR DMCs to be applicable to the 2012MY, 
thus the DMCs become -$236 (2009$) and -$167 (2009$) for 6 speed dry- and wet-clutch 
DCTs, respectively, both applicable in the 2012MY and incremental to a 4 speed auto 
transmission.  The agencies consider the 6 speed DCT technology to be on the flat portion of 
the learning curve and have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2018 then 
1.29 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-38. 
New for this analysis is costing for an 8 speed DCT.  For the cost of this technology, 
the agencies have relied on a tear-down study completed by FEV since publication of the 
TAR.53 In that study, the 8 speed DCT was found to be $198 (2007$) more costly than the 6 
speed DCT.  This DMC increment becomes $202 (2009$) for this analysis.  Adding the $202 
(2009$) to the -$236 (2009$) DMC and the -$167 (2009$) DMC for a 6 speed dry- and wet-
clutch DCT, the 8 speed dry- and wet-clutch DCTs relative to a 4 speed auto transmission 
would be -$32 (2009$) and $38 (2009$), respectively.  The agencies consider this DMC to be 
applicable to the 2012MY.  The agencies consider the 8 speed DCT technology to be on the 
flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through 
the 2024MY then 1.29 thereafter.  The 8 speed DCT has a later switch to long term ICMs 
because it is a newer technology that is not currently implemented in the fleet.  The resultant 
costs for both 6 speed and 8 speed DCTs are shown in Table 3-38.

3.4.2.7 6-Speed Manual Transmissions (6MAN) 
Manual transmissions are entirely dependent upon driver input to shift gears: the 
driver selects when to perform the shift and which gear to select.  This is the most efficient 
transfer of energy of all transmission layouts, because it has the lowest internal gear losses, 
with a minimal hydraulic system, and the driver provides the energy to actuate the clutch.  
From a systems viewpoint, however, vehicles with manual transmissions have the drawback 
that the driver may not always select the optimum gear ratio for fuel economy.  Nonetheless, 
increasing the number of available ratios in a manual transmission can improve fuel economy 
by allowing the driver to select a ratio that optimizes engine operation more often.  Typically, 
this is achieved through adding overdrive ratios to reduce engine speed at cruising velocities 
(which saves fuel through reduced engine pumping losses) and pushing the torque required of 
the engine towards the optimum level.  However, if the gear ratio steps are not properly 
designed, this may require the driver to change gears more often in city driving, resulting in 
customer dissatisfaction.  Additionally, if gear ratios are selected to achieve improved launch 
performance instead of to improve fuel economy, then no fuel saving effectiveness is realized. 
The 2012-2016 final rule estimated an effectiveness increase of 0.5 percent for 
replacing a 5-speed manual with a 6-speed manual transmission, which was derived from 
confidential manufacturer data.  Based on the updated LPM, NHTSA  has found that an 
effectiveness increase of 2.0 to 2.5 percent is possible when moving from a 5-speed to a 6-
speed manual transmission with improved internals .  NHTSA updated costs to reflect the 
ICM low complexity markup of 1.11 which resulted in an incremental compliance cost of 
$250 as compared to $338 for MY 2012.  This represents a DMC of $225 (2007$) which 
becomes $232 (2009$) for this analysis, applicable in the 2012MY.  NHTSA continues to 
consider a 6 speed manual transmission to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and has 
applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.  NHTSA’s resultant 
costs for a 6 speed manual transmission are shown in Table 3-39.

3.4.3 Vehicle electrification and hybrid electric vehicle technologies 
For the costs presented in this electrification and hybrid vehicle section, we have estimated 
costs for vehicle classes since the technologies are closely linked to the size of the vehicle as 
opposed to the number of cylinders on the engine or its valvetrain configuration.  The vehicle 
classes for which we have estimated costs are consistent with the seven vehicle classes 
developed for the lumped parameter model.  Each agency has used the vehicle class specific 
costs and mapped those into their respective model-specific vehicle classes or types as shown 
in Table 3-40.  This table simply presents the mapping of lumped parameter model vehicle 
classes (or cost vehicle classes) into model-specific vehicle classes (or vehicle types in the 
case of EPA’s OMEGA model, please refer to Chapter 1 of EPA’s draft RIA for more details) 
to help the reader understand how the vehicle classes used for costing relate to the vehicle 
classes used for modeling.

3.4.3.1 Electrical Power Steering (EPS) / Electrohydraulic Power Steering 
(EHPS) 
Electric power steering (EPS) and Electrohydraulic power steering (EHPS) provide a 
potential reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption over hydraulic power steering 
because of reduced overall accessory loads.  This eliminates the parasitic losses associated 
with belt-driven power steering pumps which consistently draw load from the engine to pump 
hydraulic fluid through the steering actuation systems even when the wheels are not being 
turned.  EPS is an enabler for all vehicle hybridization technologies since it provides power 
steering when the engine is off.  EPS may be implemented on most vehicles with a standard 
12V system.  Some heavier vehicles may require a higher voltage system or EHPS which may 
add cost and complexity. 
The 2012-2016 final rule, EPA and NHTSA estimated a 1 to 2 percent effectiveness 
for light duty vehicles based on the 2002 NAS report, Sierra Research Report and confidential 
OEM data.  The 2010 Ricardo study also confirmed this estimate.    NHTSA and EPA 
reviewed these effectiveness estimates and found them to be accurate, thus they have been 
retained for this proposal. For large pickup truck the agencies used EHPS due to the utility 
requirement of these vehicles. The effectiveness of EHPS is estimated to be 0.8 percent. 
In the MY 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $88 (2007$).  
Converting to 2009$, this DMC becomes $90 for this analysis, consistent with the recent 
heavy-duty GHG rule, which is considered applicable in the 2015MY.  The agencies use the 
same DMC for EPS as for EHPS.  Technically, EHPS is less costly than EPS.  However, we 
believe that EHPS is likely to be used, if at all, on the largest trucks and utility vehicles.  As 
such, it would probably need to be heavier-duty than typical EPS systems and the agencies 
consider the net effect to place EHPS on par with EPS in terms of costs.   The agencies 
consider EPS/EHPS technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have 
applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs 
are shown in Table 3-41.

3.4.3.2 Improved Accessories  
The accessories on an engine, including the alternator, coolant and oil pumps are 
traditionally mechanically-driven.  A reduction in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption can be 
realized by driving them electrically, and only when needed (“on-demand”).   
Electric water pumps and electric fans can provide better control of engine cooling.  
For example, coolant flow from an electric water pump can be reduced and the radiator fan 
can be shut off during engine warm-up or cold ambient temperature conditions which will 
reduce warm-up time, reduce warm-up fuel enrichment, and reduce parasitic losses. 
Indirect benefit may be obtained by reducing the flow from the water pump 
electrically during the engine warm-up period, allowing the engine to heat more rapidly and 
thereby reducing the fuel enrichment needed during cold starting of the engine.  Further 
benefit may be obtained when electrification is combined with an improved, higher efficiency 
engine alternator.  Intelligent cooling can more easily be applied to vehicles that do not 
typically carry heavy payloads, so larger vehicles with towing capacity present a challenge, as 
these vehicles have high cooling fan loads. Both agencies also included a higher efficiency 
alternator in this category to improve the cooling system. Both agencies also included a higher 
efficiency alternator in this category to improve the cooling system. 
The agencies considered whether to include electric oil pump technology for the 
rulemaking.  Because it is necessary to operate the oil pump any time the engine is running, 
electric oil pump technology has insignificant effect on efficiency.  Therefore, the agencies 
decided to not include electric oil pump technology for this proposal. 
In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies used the effectiveness value in the range of 
1 to 2 percent based on technologies discussed above. NHTSA did not apply this technology 
to large pickup truck due to the utility requirement concern for this vehicle class. 
For this proposal, the agencies are considering two levels of improved accessories. For 
level one of this technology (IACC1) NHTSA now incorporates a high efficiency alternator 
(70 percent efficiency).  The second level of improved accessories (IACC2) adds the higher 
efficiency alternator and incorporates a mild regenerative alternator strategy, as well as 
intelligent cooling.  NHTSA and EPA jointly reviewed the estimates of 1 to 2 percent 
effectiveness estimates used in the 2012-2016 final rule and TAR for level IACC1. More 
precisely, the agencies used effectiveness value in 1.2 to 1.8 percent range varying based on 
different vehicle subclasses. The incremental effectiveness for this technology in relative to 
EPS in the CAFE model is 0.91 to 1.61 percent. The combined effectiveness for IACC1 and 
IACC2 ranges from 3.1 to 3.9 percent and NHTSA applied incremental effectiveness of 
IACC2 in relative to IACC1 ranging from 1.74 to 2.55 percent. 
In the 2012-2016 rule, the agencies estimated the DMC of IACC1 at $71 (2007$).  
Converting to 2009$, this DMC becomes $73 for this analysis, applicable in the 2015MY, and 
consistent with the heavy-duty GHG rule.  The agencies consider IACC1 technology to be on

the flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 
2018 then 1.19 thereafter.   
Cost is higher for IACC2 due to the inclusion of a higher efficiency alternator and a 
mild level of regeneration.  The agencies estimate the DMC of the higher efficiency alternator 
and the regeneration strategy at $45 (2009$) incremental to IACC1, applicable in the 
2015MY.  Including the costs for IACC1 results in a DMC for IACC2 of $118 (2009$) 
relative to the baseline case and applicable in the 2015MY.  The agencies consider the IACC2 
technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve.  The agencies have applied a low 
complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in 
Table 3-42.

3.4.3.4 Stop-start (12V Micro Hybrid)  
The stop-start technology we consider for this proposal—also known as idle-stop or 
12-volt micro-hybrid—is the most basic hybrid system that facilitates idle-stop capability.  
When vehicle comes to a stop, the system will automatically shut down the internal 
combustion engine and restarts the engine when vehicle starts to move again. This is 
especially beneficial to reduce emission and fuel consumption when vehicle spends 
significant amount of time stopping in traffic jam. Along with other enablers, this system 
typically replaces the standard 12-volt starter with an improved unit capable of higher power 
and increased cycle life.  These systems typically incorporate an improved battery to prevent 
voltage-droop on restart.  Different from MY 2012-2016 rule, this technology is applied to all 
vehicle classes, including large pickup truck. In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, even though EPA 
did not use 12 volt stop-start technology, NHTSA and EPA jointly reviewed the assumption. 
The effectiveness NHTSA used in the CAFE model for MYs 2012-2016 final rule ranged 
from 2 to 4 percent, depending on whether the vehicle is equipped with a 4-, 6- or 8-cylinder 
engine, with the 4-cylinder engine having the lowest range and the 8-cylinder having the 
highestgg. In this NPRM analysis, when combining IACC1, IACC2 and 12V stop-start system, 
the estimated effectiveness based on 2010 Ricardo study ranges from 4.8 percent to 5.9 
percent. The agencies applied this effectiveness in the NPRM analysis. For CAFE modeling, 
the incremental effectiveness for 12V stop-start relative to IACC2 is 1.68 to 2.2 percent.  
In the 2012-2016 rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $282 (2007$) to $350 
(2007$) for small cars through large trucks, respectively.  Converting to 2009$, these DMCs 
become $290 (2009$) through $361 (2009$) for this analysis which are considered applicable 
in the 2015MY.  The agencies consider 12V stop-start technology to be on the steep portion 
of the learning curve in the 2012-2016 timeframe and flat thereafter and have applied a 
medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2018 then 1.29 thereafter.  The resultant costs are 
shown in Table 3-44.

3.4.3.5 Mild Hybrid 
Mild hybrid systems, also called Higher Voltage Stop-Start and Belt Mounted 
Integrated Starter Generator (BISG) systems are similar to a micro-hybrid system, offering 
idle-stop functionality, except that they utilize larger electric machine and a higher capacity 
battery, typically 42 volts or above, thus enabling a limited level of regenerative braking 
unavailable for a MHEV.  The larger electric machine and battery also enables a limited 
degree of power assist, which MHEV cannot provide.  However, because of the limited torque 
capacity of the belt-driven design, these systems have a smaller electric machine, and thus 
less capability than crank-integrated or stronger hybrid systems.  These systems replace the 
conventional alternator with a belt-driven starter/alternator and may add high voltage 
electrical accessories (which may include electric power steering and an auxiliary automatic 
transmission pump).  The limited electrical requirements of these systems allow the use of 
lead-acid batteries or supercapacitors for energy storage. 
The MY 2012-2016 final rule estimates the effectiveness for these technologies range 
from 3.0 to 7.5 percent depending on vehicle subclass.  The CAFE model, which applies this 
effectiveness incrementally to the prior 12 Volt MHEV technology, uses estimates of 4 to 6 
percent.   
EPA estimates an incremental compliance cost range of $549 (small car) to $682 
(large truck) for a MY 2012 vehicle and including a medium complexity ICM of 1.25 
(2007$).  With volume-based learning applied, these become $351 (small car) and $437 (large 
truck) for a MY 2016 vehicle (2007$).  The cost estimate in the CAFE model is incremental 
to the 12 Volt micro hybrid systems as noted above, and therefore is adjusted upwards to $286 
to reflect the additional battery capacity, wiring upgrades, and a larger optimized electric 
machine only.  The $286 reflects volume-based learning factors and the ICM medium-
complexity markup of 1.25. This technology is not applied in this NPRM analysis. 
 
3.4.3.5.1 Integrated Motor Assist (IMA)/Crank Integrated Starter Generator (CISG) 
IMA is a system developed and marketed by Honda54 and is similar to CISG.  They 
both utilize a thin axial electric motor bolted to the engine’s crankshaft and connected to the 
transmission through a torque converter or clutch.  The axial motor is motor/generator that 
typically operates above 100 volts (but lower than the stronger hybrid systems discussed 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-113 
 
below, which typically operate at around 300 volts) and can provide sufficient torque for 
launch as well as generate sufficient current to provide significant levels of brake energy 
recovery.  The motor/generator also acts as the starter for the engine and can replace a typical 
accessory-driven alternator.  Current IMA/CISG systems typically do not launch the vehicle 
on electric power alone, although some commercially available systems can cruise on electric 
power and dual-clutch IMA/CISG systems capable of all-electric drive are under 
development.  IMA and CISG could be applied to all classes of vehicles. This technology is 
not used as an enabling technology in this NPRM analysis by either EPA or NHTSA. 
EPA relied on a combination of certification data (comparing vehicles available with 
and without a hybrid system and backing out other components where appropriate) and 
manufacturer-supplied information to determine that the effectiveness of these systems in 
terms of CO2 reduction is 30 percent for small cars, 25 percent for large cars, and 20 percent 
for minivans and small trucks similar to the range estimated by NHTSA for the respective 
vehicle classes.  The effectiveness for small cars assumes engine downsizing to maintain 
approximately equivalent performance.  The large car, minivan, and small truck effectiveness 
values assume less engine downsizing in order to improve vehicle performance and/or 
maintain towing and hauling performance. 
In the 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $1,973, $2,497, 
$2,508, $2,366 and $3,063 (all values in 2007$) for a small car, large car, minivan, small 
truck and large truck, respectively.  These DMCs become $2,034, $2,575, $2,586, $2,440 and 
$3,159 (all values in 2009$) for this analysis.  All of these DMCs are considered applicable in 
the 2015MY.  The agencies consider the IMA technology to be on the steep portion of the 
learning curve and have applied a high1 complexity ICM of 1.56 through 2018 then 1.35 
thereafter.  The resultant costs are as shown in Table 3-45.  As noted earlier, the IMA 
technology is not included as an enabling technology in this analysis, although it is included 
as a baseline technology because it exists in the 2008 baseline fleet. The agencies moved 
away from this technology and applied P2 hybrid instead because comparing to IMA, P2 is 
more cost effective.

3.4.3.6 HEV, PHEV, EV and Fuel Cell Vehicle Technologies 
A hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that combines two or more sources of propulsion energy, 
where one uses a consumable fuel (like gasoline), and one is rechargeable (during operation, 
or by another energy source).  Hybrid technology is well established in the U.S. market and 
more manufacturers are adding hybrid models to their lineups.  Hybrids reduce fuel 
consumption through three major mechanisms: 
• The internal combustion engine can be optimized (through downsizing, modifying 
the operating cycle, or other control techniques) to operate at or near its most 
efficient point more of the time.  Power loss from engine downsizing can be 
mitigated by employing power assist from the secondary power source. 
• Some of the energy normally lost as heat while braking can be captured and stored 
in the energy storage system for later use. 
• The engine is turned off when it is not needed, such as when the vehicle is coasting 
or when stopped. 
Hybrid vehicles utilize some combination of the three above mechanisms to reduce 
fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.  A fourth mechanism to reduce petroleum fuel 
consumption, available only to plug-in hybrids, is by substituting the petroleum fuel energy 
with energy from another source, such as the electric grid.  The effectiveness of fuel 
consumption and CO2 reduction depends on the utilization of the above mechanisms and how 
aggressively they are pursued.  One area where this variation is particularly prevalent is in the 
choice of engine size and its effect on balancing fuel economy and performance.  Some 
manufacturers choose not to downsize the engine when applying hybrid technologies.  In 
these cases, performance is vastly improved, while fuel efficiency improves significantly less 
than if the engine was downsized to maintain the same performance as the conventional 
version.  While this approach has been used in cars such as the Lexus 600h luxury vehicle, it 
is more likely to be used in the future for vehicles like trucks where towing and/or hauling are 
an integral part of their performance requirements.  In these cases, if the engine is downsized, 
the battery can be quickly drained during a long hill climb with a heavy load, leaving only a 
downsized engine to carry the entire load.  Because towing capability is currently a heavily-
marketed truck attribute, manufacturers are hesitant to offer a truck with downsized engine 
which can lead to a significantly diminished towing performance when the battery state of 
charge level is low, and therefore engines are traditionally not downsized for these vehicles. 
Although hybrid vehicles using other energy storage concepts (flywheel, hydraulic) 
have been developed, the automotive systems in production for passenger cars and light 
trucks are all hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) that use battery storage and electric drive

systems.  This appears likely to be the case for the foreseeable future.  HEVs are part of a 
continuum of vehicles using systems with differing levels of electric drive and electric energy 
storage.  This range of vehicles includes relatively basic system without electric energy 
storage such as engine start/stop systems; HEV systems with varying degrees of electric 
storage and electric drive system capability including mild-hybrid electric vehicles (MHEV) 
with limited capability but lower cost; strong hybrid  electric vehicles (SHEV) with full 
hybridization capability such as the P2 hybrid technology which the agencies evaluate as a 
compliance option  in this NPRM; plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) with differing 
degrees of all electric range and battery electric vehicles (EV) that rely entirely on electric 
drive and battery electric energy storage.  
Different HEV, PHEV and EV concepts utilize these mechanisms differently, so they 
are treated separately for the purposes of this analysis.  In many applications, particularly with 
PHEV and EV, the battery represents the most costly and system-limiting sub-component of 
the hybrid system.  Currently, there are many battery chemistries being developed and refined 
for hybrid applications that are expected to enhance the performance of future hybrid 
vehicles. Section 3.4.3.6.4 contains a discussion of battery energy storage and the major 
hybrid concepts that were determined to be available during the MY 2017-2015 timeframe.     
Fuel cell vehicles are a separate category of electric vehicle that rely entirely on 
electric propulsion with electricity produced on-board the vehicle using a proton-exchange-
membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) fueled with hydrogen.  Fuel cell vehicles under development 
are typically configured as a hybrid with battery storage used to provide brake energy 
recovery and improved response to fast transients in vehicle energy demand.  
3.4.3.6.1 Power-split hybrid  
Power-split hybrid (PSHEV) – a hybrid electric drive system that replaces the 
traditional transmission with a single planetary gear set and a motor/generator.  This 
motor/generator uses the engine to either charge the battery or to supply additional power to 
the drive motor.  A second, more powerful motor/generator is permanently connected to the 
vehicle’s final drive and always turns with the wheels.  The planetary gear splits engine power 
between the first motor/generator and the drive motor to either charge the battery or supply 
power to the wheels. Power-split hybrids are not used as an enabling technology in this 
proposal. 
In MYs 2012-2016 final rule, EPA and NHTSA used a combination of manufacturer-
supplied information and a comparison of vehicles available with and without a hybrid system 
from EPA’s fuel economy test data to determine that the effectiveness is 19 to 36 percent for 
the classes to which it is applied. The estimate would depend on whether engine downsizing 
is also assumed.  In the CAFE incremental model, the range of effectiveness used was 23 to 
33 percent as engine downsizing is not assumed (and accounted for elsewhere). 
For this analysis, in order to estimate baseline costs, the agencies are using power-split 
HEV costs generated by FEV as part of a tear-down study.  In that study, FEV found the 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

DMC of the entire power-split system (battery-pack and non-battery components) to be 
$2,853 (2007$), $3,175 (2007$), $3,435 (2007$), $4,168 (2007$) for vehicle sized, for 
example, like a Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, Ford Fusion and Ford Flex, respectively.  For this 
analysis, these values become $2,942, $3,274, $3,542 and $4,298, respectively, all in 2009 
dollars.  In the 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies estimated the DMC of a large truck power-
split system at $5,137 (2007$) which becomes $5,299 for this analysis (2009$) and we are 
using this value for the minivan-towing vehicle class.  All of these DMCs are considered 
applicable in the 2015MY.  The agencies consider the power-split technology to be on the flat 
portion of the learning curve and have applied a high1 complexity ICM of 1.56 through 2018 
then 1.35 thereafter.  The resultant costs are as shown in Table 3-46. As noted earlier, the 
IMA technology is not included as an enabling technology in this analysis, although it is 
included as a baseline technology because it exists in the 2008 baseline fleet.

3.4.3.6.2 2-mode hybrid  
2-mode hybrid (2MHEV) – is a hybrid electric drive system that uses an adaptation of 
a conventional stepped-ratio automatic transmission by replacing some of the transmission 
clutches with two electric motors that control the ratio of engine speed to vehicle speed, while 
clutches allow the motors to be bypassed.  This improves both the transmission torque 
capacity for heavy-duty applications and reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions at 
highway speeds relative to other types of hybrid electric drive systems.  2-mode hybrids have 
not been considered in this proposal.  Depending on the comments that the agencies received 
for this NPRM, the agencies might re-consider this hybrid technology in vehicles with towing 
requirement, such as pickup trucks, in the final rule. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-117 
 
For MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the CAFE model considered a range of 23 to 33 
percent with a midpoint of 28 percent, assuming no engine downsizing to preserve the utility 
nature of medium and large trucks (e.g., maintaining full towing capability even in situations 
with low battery charge) and EPA estimates CO2 emissions reduction effectiveness to be 25 
percent for large trucks (LDT3 and LDT4 categories) based on vehicle certification data.  
EPA estimates an effectiveness of 40 percent for smaller vehicles. 
The agencies have estimated the costs for 2-mode hybrids using costs used in the 2010 
TAR.  For this analysis, the 2-mode battery pack DMC is estimated at $1,078 (2009$) and the 
DMC of non-battery components is estimated at $2,938 (2009$).  The battery pack DMC is 
considered to be applicable for the 2025MY while the non-battery pack DMC would be 
applicable for the 2012MY.   The agencies consider the 2-mode battery packs to be on the 
steep portion of the learning curve during the 2017-2025 timeframe.  The agencies have 
applied a high1 complexity ICM of 1.56 through 2018 then 1.35 thereafter.  For 2-mode non-
battery components, the agencies consider them to be on the flat portion of the learning curve 
in the 2017-2025 timeframe and have applied a high1 complexity ICM of 1.56 through 2018 
then 1.35 thereafter.  The resultant 2-mode hybrid costs are presented in Table 3-47.

3.4.3.6.3 P2 Hybrid  
A P2 hybrid is a vehicle with an electric drive motor coupled to the engine crankshaft 
via a clutch.  The engine and the drive motor are mechanically independent of each other, 
allowing the engine or motor to power the vehicle separately or combined.  This is similar to 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-118 
 
the Honda HEV architecture with the exception of the added clutch, and larger batteries and 
motors.  Examples of this include the Hyundai Sonata HEV and Infiniti M35h.  The agencies 
believe that the P2 is an example of a “strong” hybrid technology that is typical of what we 
will see in the timeframe of this rule.  The agencies could have equally chosen the power-split 
architecture as the representative HEV architecture.  These two HEV’s have similar average 
effectiveness values (combined city and highway fuel economy), though the P2 systems may 
have lower cost due to the lower number of parts and complexity.   
The P2 Hybrid is a newly emerging hybrid technology that uses a transmission 
integrated electric motor placed between the engine and a gearbox or CVT, much like the 
IMA system described above except with a wet or dry separation clutch which is used to 
decouple the motor/transmission from the engine.  In addition, a P2 Hybrid would typically be 
equipped with a larger electric machine.  Disengaging the clutch allows all-electric operation 
and more efficient brake-energy recovery.  Engaging the clutch allows efficient coupling of 
the engine and electric motor and, when combined with a DCT transmission, reduces gear-
train losses relative to PSHEV or 2MHEV systems.   
For purposes of this rulemaking analysis, the agencies are assuming that P2 hybrids 
will become the dominant technology in the MYs 2017-2025 timeframe, replacing costlier 
power-split or 2-mode architectures while providing substantially similar efficiency 
improvement.  At the present time, P2 hybrids are relatively new to the market and the 
agencies have not attempted to quantify any measurable performance differential between 
these technologies.  As mentioned, the 2011 Hyundai Sonata, 2011 Volkswagen Touareg 
Hybrid, the 2011 Porsche S Hybrid, and the 2012 Infiniti M35 Hybrid are examples of P2 
hybrids currently in production and available to consumers.   The agencies are aware of some 
articles in trade journals, newspapers and other reviews that some first generation P2 hybrid 
vehicles with planetary gear transmissions have trade-offs in NVH and drivability – though 
these reviews do not cover all of the P2 systems available today, and a number of reviews are 
very positive with respect to NVH and drivability.  The agencies recognize that manufacturers 
will have several years to test, develop and improve P2 technology in the years before 2017.  
We expect that manufacturers will address any perceived integration issues in early 
production models. However, we believe it is important to continue to monitor development 
of P2 hybrids and market acceptance of this technology.  We will continue to gather 
information on these issues and consider them as part of the mid-term evaluation. 
The agencies request comment regarding the potential of P2 hybrids to overcome 
these issues or others, and we specifically seek comment from automakers developing and 
considering P2 technology on whether they believe these to be significant impediments to 
deployment and how they may be addressed. 
The effectiveness used for vehicle packages with the P2-hybrid configuration within 
this analysis reflects a conservative estimate of system performance.  Vehicle simulation 
modeling of technology packages using the P-2 hybrid has recently been completed under a 
contract with Ricardo Engineering.  The agencies have updated the effectiveness of hybrid 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-119 
 
electric vehicle packages using the new Ricardo vehicle simulation modeling runs for this 
analysis.     
Due to the lower cost and comparative effectiveness of P2 hybrid in relative to other 
strong hybrid technologies, such as power-split hybrid and 2-mode hybrid, the agencies 
assume P2 hybrid application for all vehicle sub-classes in this NPRM analysis and increased 
HEV effectiveness by approximately 2% comparing to 2012-2016 light duty GHG/CAFE 
final rule based on published data for new HEVs that have entered into production, such as  
2011 Hyundai Sonata hybrid, 2010 Hyundai Elantra LPI HEV (Korean market only), 2011 
Infiniti G35 Hybrid and 2011 Volkswagen Touareg Hybrid).  In addition, for the Large Car, 
Minivan and Small Truck subclasses, the agencies further increased HEV effectiveness by 
assuming that towing capacity could be reduced from their current ratinghh  to approximately 
1,500 pounds for some vehicles in these subclasses without significantly impacting 
consumers’ need for utility in these vehicles.ii  -  The agencies believe that consumers for 
these vehicles who require higher towing capacity could acquire it by purchasing a vehicle 
with a more capable non-hybrid powertrain (as they do today).jj  Moreover, it is likely that 
some fraction of consumers who purchase the larger engine option do so for purposes of 
hauling and acceleration performance, not just maximum towing.  
A reduction in towing capacity allows greater engine downsizing, which increases 
estimated overall HEV system incremental effectiveness by 5 to 10 percent for Large Cars, 
Minivans, and Small Trucks, similar to the HEV effectiveness value assumed for Small Cars 
and Compact Cars.kk   
Based on the recent Ricardo study, the effectiveness for P2 hybrid used in this NPRM 
is 46.2 percent for subcompact and compact passenger cars, 48.6 percent for midsize 
passenger car, 49.4 percent for large passenger car, 46.1 percent for small light truck, 45.7 
percent for midsize SUV, truck and minivan and 45.1 percent for large pickup truck. 
The agencies have applied a high complexity ICM to both the battery and non-battery 
component costs for P2 hybrid. But for battery for P2 hybrid, the ICM switches from short 
                                                 
hh
 Current small SUVs and Minivans have an approximate average towing capacity of 2000 lbs (without a 
towing package), but range from no towing capacity to 3500 pounds. 
ii
 We note that there are some gasoline vehicles in the large car/minivan/small truck segments sold today which 
do not have any towing rating.   
jj
 The agencies recognize that assuming that certain consumers will choose to purchase non-hybrid vehicles in 
order to obtain their desired towing capacity could lead to some increase in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions 
as compared to assuming that towing capacity is maintained for hybrid vehicles across the board. However, the 
agencies think it likely that the net improvement in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions due to the increased 
numbers of hybrids available for consumers to choose will offset any potential increase in fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions resulting from consumers selecting the higher-performance non-hybrid powertrain vehicles. 
kk
 The effectiveness of HEVs for heavier vehicles which require conventional towing capabilities is markedly 
less because the rated power of the IC engine must be similar to its non-hybrid brethren.  As such, there is less 
opportunity for downsizing with these vehicles.

term value of 1.56 to long term value of 1.35 at 2024 while for the non-battery component the 
switch happens at 2018. 
The costs for P2 hybrids without mass reduction as used in the Volpe model are listed 
in Table 3-48. NHTSA accounts the cost impact from the interaction between mass reduction 
and sizing of the electrification system (battery and non-battery system) as a cost synergy as 
described in section 3.4.3.9.  Estimated costs for P2 HEVs with mass reduction as used in the 
OMEGA model are presented in Sections 3.4.3.9 and 3.4.3.10 below.

3.4.3.6.4 Plug-In Hybrid 
Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are very similar to Hybrid Electric 
Vehicles, but with three significant functional differences.  The first is the addition of a means 
to charge the battery pack from an outside source of electricity (e.g., the electric grid).  
Second, a PHEV would have a larger battery pack with more energy storage, and a greater 
capability to be discharged.  Finally, a PHEV would have a control system that allows the 
battery pack to be significantly depleted during normal operation. 
Table 3-49 below, illustrates how PHEVs compare functionally to both hybrid electric 
vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles (EV).  These characteristics can change significantly 
within each vehicle class/subclass, so this is simply meant as an illustration of the general 
characteristics.  In reality, the design options are so varied that all these vehicles exist on a 
continuum with HEVs on one end and EVs on the other.

Deriving some of their propulsion energy from the electric grid provides several 
advantages for PHEVs.  PHEVs offer a significant opportunity to replace petroleum used for 
transportation energy with domestically-produced electricity.  The reduction in petroleum 
usage does, of course, depend on the amount of electric drive the vehicle is capable of under 
its duty cycle.  PHEVs also provide electric utilities the possibility to increase electric 
generation during “off-peak” periods overnight when there is excess generation capacity and 
electricity prices are lower.  Utilities like to increase this “base load” because it increases 
overall system efficiency and lowers average costs.  PHEVs can lower localized emissions of 
criteria pollutants and air toxics especially in urban areas by operating on electric power.  The 
emissions from the power generation occur outside the urban area at the power generation 
plant which provides health benefits for residents of the more densely populated urban areas 
by moving emissions of ozone precursors out of the urban air shed.  Unlike most other 
alternative fuel technologies, PHEVs can initially use an existing infrastructure for refueling 
(charging and liquid refueling) so investments in infrastructure may be reduced.   
In analyzing the impacts of grid-connected vehicles like PHEVs and EVs, the 
emissions from the electrical generation can be accounted for if a full upstream and 
downstream analysis is desired.  While this issue is being studied on an on-going basis, 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

upstream CO2 emissions are not unique to grid-connected technologies and so are not 
included in this analysis.  Sec II of the Preamble has more information on upstream emissions.   
PHEVs will be considerably more costly than conventional vehicles and some other 
advanced technologies due to the fact that PHEVs require both conventional internal 
combustion engine and electrical driving system and the larger expensive battery pack.  To 
take full advantage of their capability, consumers would have to be willing to charge the 
vehicles during electricity off-peak hours during the night, and would need access to electric 
power where they park their vehicles.  For many urban dwellers who may park on the street, 
or in private or public lots or garages, charging may not be practical.  Charging may be 
possible at an owner’s place of work, but that would increase grid loading during peak hours 
which would eliminate some of the benefits to utilities of off-peak charging versus on-peak.  
Oil savings will still be the same in this case assuming the vehicle can be charged fully. 
The effectiveness potential of PHEVs depends on many factors, the most important 
being the energy storage capacity designed into the battery pack.  To estimate the fuel 
consumption and tailpipe CO2 reduction potential of PHEVs, EPA has developed an in-house 
vehicle energy model (PEREGRIN) to estimate the fuel consumption/CO2 emissions 
reductions of PHEVs.  This model is based on the PERE (Physical Emission Rate Estimator) 
physics-based model used as a fuel consumption input for EPA’s MOVES mobile source 
emissions model.   
How EPA Estimates PHEV Effectiveness 
The PHEV small car, large car, minivan and small trucks were modeled using 
parameters from a midsize car similar to today’s hybrids and scaled to each vehicle’s weight.  
The large truck PHEV was modeled separately assuming no engine downsizing.  PHEVs can 
have a wide variation in the All Electric Range (AER) that they offer.  Some PHEVs are of 
the “blended” type where the engine is on during most of the vehicle operation, but the 
proportion of electric energy that is used to propel the vehicle is significantly higher than that 
used in a PSHEV or 2MHEV.  Each PHEV was modeled with enough battery capacity for a 
20-mile-equivalent AER and a power requirement to provide similar performance to a hybrid 
vehicle.  20 miles was selected because it offers a good compromise for vehicle performance, 
weight, battery packaging and cost.  Given expected near-term battery capability, a 20 mile 
range represents the likely capability that will be seen in PHEVs in the near-to-mid term.  
To calculate the total energy use of a PHEV, the PHEV can be thought of as operating 
in two distinct modes, electric (EV) mode, and hybrid (HEV) mode.  At the tailpipe, the CO2 
emissions during EV operation are zero.  The EV mode fuel economy can then be combined 
with the HEV mode fuel economy using the Utility Factor calculation in SAE J1711 to 
determine a total MPG value for the vehicle.  (See Table 3-50)

Baseline FE 29.3 mpg 19.2 mpg 
Percent FE gain 139% 90% 
Percent CO2 reduction -58% -47% 
Calculating a total fuel consumption and tailpipe CO2 reduction based on model 
outputs and the Utility Factor calculations results in a 58 percent reduction for small cars, 
large cars, minivans, and small trucks.  For large trucks, the result is a 47 percent reduction.  
The lower improvement is due to less engine downsizing in the large truck class.   
How NHTSA Estimates PHEV Effectiveness 
For CAFE calculation, PHEV is treated as a dual fuel vehicle. NHTSA needs to 
consider using dual fuel vehicle calculation for PHEV and uses a petroleum equivalency 
factor as stated in 49 U.S.C. 32904 and 32905.  
When deciding PHEV and EV effectiveness, NHTSA referenced the fuel economy of 
3 pairs of vehicles for which NHTSA has fuel economy data in the CAFE database. These 
three vehicles pairs are MiniE electric vehicle versus gasoline powered Mini with automatic 
transmission, Tesla Roadster electric vehicle versus gasoline powered rear-wheel-drive Lotus 
Elise Sedan with a 6-speed manual transmission, and Nissan Leaf electric vehicle versus 
gasoline powered Nissan Sentra with automatic transmission. The fuel economy and fuel 
consumption for the first two pairs are shown in Table 3-51. Nissan Leaf information is used 
but not shown in the table because it is confidential information. Because technologies are 
applied in the CAFE model in an incremental manner, the effectiveness for each technology is 
incremental to the previous technology. In the electrification decision tree of the CAFE 
model, the order of technology selection starts from gasoline only powertrain, then moves to 
strong hybrid, to plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and finally to electric vehicle. So the 
incremental effectiveness for each step has to be defined.

In order to calculate the effectiveness of PHEV for purposes of a CAFE standard, fuel 
economy for strong hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) is calculated first using the incremental 
effectiveness of strong hybrid from LPM model which is around 46 percent. For an example, 
the derived fuel economy for SHEV based on Mini Gas ATX is 71.7 mpg. Then the fuel 
economy from gasoline source for PHEV is assumed to be the same as SHEV fuel economy, 
i.e. 71.7 mpg in the case of Mini E. The petroleum equivalent fuel economy from the 
electricity source is set to be the same as the EV fuel economy, i.e. 342.4 mpg in the case of 
Mini E. The combined fuel economy for PHEV is calculated using the 50-50 weighting factor 
as follows.

NHTSA decided to use a 50-50 weighing factor in the calculation above by modeling 
a 30-mile range PHEV. According to SAE standard J1711, a vehicle with 27.4 to 28.2 mile 
charge depleting range has a 0.5 utility factor. This utility factor value of 0.5 is equivalent to 
50-50 weighting for dual fuel vehicle calculation. In the NPRM analysis, EPA models a 20-
mile range and a 40-mile range PHEV. 
The incremental fuel consumption reduction for PHEV is then calculated in relative to 
strong HEV. Using the example of Mini E, the incremental fuel consumption reduction for 
PHEV relative to SHEV is 39.5 percent as shown below.

Table 3-52 lists the incremental effectiveness calculation for two pairs of vehicles, 
MiniE and Tesla Roaster. Incremental fuel consumption calculation for PHEV based on 
Nissan Leaf is not shown in Table 3-52 due to confidentiality of the fuel economy rating. The 
derived incremental effectiveness for Nissan Leaf is 40.6%.  The average incremental 
effectiveness of these three pairs of vehicles is 40.65 percent which is used in CAFE 
modeling.

The average effectiveness for the three pairs of vehicles of 68.54% is used in CAFE 
modeling. 
The cost of PHEV consists of three parts, the cost for battery, the cost for non-battery 
systems and the cost for charger and the labor to install it. Costs for PHEVs without mass 
reduction as used in the Volpe model are listed in Table 3-53 to Table 3-55. NHTSA accounts 
the cost impact from the interaction between mass reduction and sizing of the electrification 
system (battery and non-battery system) as a cost synergy as described in section 3.4.3.9.  
Sections 3.4.3.9 and 3.4.3.10 contain the cost for PHEVs with mass reduction as used in 
EPA’s OMEGA model.  PHEV20 and PHEV40 are sized by EPA with the methodologies 
discussed in section 3.4.3.8.  
The battery pack DMCs for PHEV20 and PHEV40 are calculated using ANL’s BatPac 
model.  NHTSA modeled a PHEV 30 for this proposal, for which NHTSA averaged the costs 
of PHEV20s and PHEV40s.

The agencies have applied a high complexity ICM to non-battery component cost for 
PHEV and PHEV charger, which switch from short term value of 1.56 to long term value of 
1.35 at 2018. The agencies applied a higher ICM factor to the battery of PHEV due to the fact 
that it a more complex technology. The ICM for PHEV battery switches from short term 
value of 1.77 to long term value of 1.50 at 2024.

3.4.3.6.5 Electric vehicles  
Electric vehicles (EV) – are vehicles with all-electric drive and with vehicle systems 
powered by energy-optimized batteries charged primarily from grid electricity. While the 
2016 FRM did not anticipate a significant penetration of EVs, in this analysis, EVs with 
several ranges have been included. The GHG effectiveness is unchanged from estimates used 
for 2016 model year vehicles in the 2012-2016 final rule which is 100 percent GHG 
reduction.  NHTSA uses petroleum equivalency factor in calculating the effectiveness for EVs 
as stated in the section above for PHEV.  
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-131 
 
Once the fuel economy of the PHEV is calculated as shown in the previous section, 
the effectiveness of PHEV incremental to EV can be calculated similarly using the formula 
below.

\100% 
The average effectiveness for the three pairs of vehicles of 68.54% is used in CAFE 
modeling. 
Battery costs assume that battery packs for EV applications will be designed to last for 
the full useful life of the vehicle at a useable state of charge equivalent to 80% of the nominal 
battery pack capacity. NHTSA applied a 75-mile range EV and a 150-mile range EV in this 
NPRM analysis. As this technology is entering the market, the OEM will try to keep the cost 
low at the beginning so that there will be more penetration. Due to the high cost of the battery 
packs at this early stage of EVs, OEM will try to limit the battery pack size to reduce cost. 
Also the early adopters for this technology are normally urban drivers and range anxiety is not 
a big concern to them. Therefore NHTSA applied a 75-mile range EV for early adoption of 
this technology in the market. As the technology develops and as the market penetration 
increases, OEMs need to help the consumers overcome the range anxiety and longer driving 
range will be expected. NHTSA applied 150-mile EV for this broad market adoption of this 
technology.   
The cost of an EV consists of three parts, cost of battery pack, cost of non-battery systems, 
and cost of charger and charger installation labor. The agencies have applied a high 
complexity ICM to non-battery component cost for EVs and EV chargers, which switch from 
short term value of 1.56 to long term value of 1.35 at 2018. The agencies applied a higher 
ICM factor to the battery of EVs due to the fact that it a more complex technology. The ICM 
for EV battery switches from short term value of 1.77 to long term value of 1.50 at 2024. The 
agencies present costs of EVs in Sections 3.4.3.9 and 3.4.3.10. The costs of EVs without mass 
reduction as applied in Volpe model are listed in Table 3-56 to Table 3-58. NHTSA accounts 
the cost impact from the interaction between mass reduction and sizing of electrification 
system (battery and non-battery system) as cost synergy as described in section 3.4.3.9.

3.4.3.6.6 Fuel cell electric vehicles  
Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) – utilize a full electric drive platform but consume 
electricity generated by an on-board fuel cell and hydrogen fuel.  Fuel cells are electro-
chemical devices that directly convert reactants (hydrogen and oxygen via air) into electricity, 
with the potential of achieving more than twice the efficiency of conventional internal 
combustion engines.  High pressure gaseous hydrogen storage tanks are used by most 
automakers for FCEVs that are currently under development.  The high pressure tanks are 
similar to those used for compressed gas storage in more than 10 million CNG vehicles 
worldwide, except that they are designed to operate at a higher pressure (350 bar or 700 bar 
vs. 250 bar for CNG).  Due to the uncertainty of the future availability for this technology, 
FCEVs were not included in any OMEGA or Volpe model runs. 
 
3.4.3.7 Batteries for MHEV, HEV, PHEV and EV Applications 
The design of battery secondary cells can vary considerably between MHEV, HEV, 
PHEV and EV applications.  
MHEV batteries:  Due to their lower voltage (12-42 VDC) and reduced power and 
energy requirements, MHEV systems may continue to use lead-acid batteries even long term 
(2017 model year and later).  MHEV battery designs differ from those of current starved-
electrolyte (typical maintenance free batteries) or flooded-electrolyte (the older style lead-acid 
batteries requiring water “top-off”) batteries used for starting, lighting and ignition (SLI) in 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-136 
 
automotive applications.  Standard SLI batteries are primarily designed to provide high-
current for engine start-up and then recharge immediately after startup via the vehicle’s 
charging system. Deeply discharging a standard SLI battery will greatly shorten its life. 
MHEV applications are expected to use: 
• Extended-cycle-life flooded (ELF) lead-acid batteries 
• Absorptive glass matt, valve-regulated lead-acid (AGM/VRLA) batteries –or –  
• Asymmetric lead-acid battery/capacitor hybrids (e.g., flooded ultrabatteries) 
MHEV systems using electrolytic double-layer capacitors are also under development and 
may provide improved performance and reduced cost in the post-2017 timeframe. 
HEV batteries:  HEV applications operate in a narrow, short-cycling, charge-
sustaining state of charge (SOC).  Energy capacity in HEV applications is somewhat limited 
by the ability of the battery and power electronics to accept charge and by space and weight 
constraints within the vehicle design.  HEV battery designs tend to be optimized for high 
power density rather than high energy density, with thinner cathode and anode layers and 
more numerous current collectors and separators (Figure 3-20).   
EV batteries:  EV batteries tend to be optimized for high energy density and are 
considerably larger and heavier than HEV batteries in order to provide sufficient energy 
capacity.  EV battery cells tend to have thicker cathode and anode layers and fewer collectors 
and separators than HEV cells.  This reduced the specific cost on a per-kW-hr basis for EV 
battery cells relative to HEV battery cells. 
PHEV batteries:  PHEV battery designs are intermediate between power-optimized 
HEV and energy-optimized EV battery cell designs.  PHEV batteries must provide both 
charge depleting operation similar to an EV and charge sustaining operation similar to an 
HEV.  Unlike HEV applications, charge-sustaining operation with PHEVs occurs at a 
relatively low battery state of charge (SOC) which can pose a significant challenge with 
respect to attaining acceptable battery cycle life.  In the case of the GM Volt, this limits 
charge depleting operation to a minimum SOC of approximately 30 percent.55  An alternative 
approach for PHEV applications that has potential to allow extension of charge depletion to a 
lower battery SOC is using energy-optimized lithium-ion batteries for charge depleting 
operation in combination with the use of supercapacitors for charge sustaining operation.56

Figure 3-20: Schematic representation of power and energy optimized  
prismatic-layered battery cells 
 
Power-split hybrid vehicles from Toyota, Ford and Nissan (which uses the Toyota 
system under license), integrated motor assist hybrid vehicles from Honda and the GM 2-
mode hybrid vehicles currently use nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries.  Lithium-ion (Li-
ion) batteries offer the potential to approximately double both the energy and power density 
relative to current NiMH batteries, enabling much more electrical-energy-intensive 
automotive applications such as PHEVs and EVs.   
Li-ion batteries for high-volume automotive applications differ substantially from 
those used in consumer electronics applications with respect to cathode chemistry, 
construction and cell size.   Li-ion battery designs currently in production by CPI (LG-Chem) 
for the GM Volt PHEV and by AESC and  GS-Yuasa (respectively) for the Nissan Leaf and 
Mitsubishi i-Miev use large-format, layered-prismatic cells assembled into battery modules.  
The modules are then combined into battery packs. 
Two families of cathode chemistries are used in large-format, automotive Li-ion 
batteries currently in production – LiMn2O4-spinel (CPI, GS-Yuasa, AESC) and LiFePO4 
(A123 Systems).  Current production batteries typically use graphite anodes. Automotive Li-
ion batteries using lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide cathodes with graphite 
anodes are in advanced stages of development for PHEV and EV applications.  The agencies 
expect large-format Li-ion batteries to completely replace NiMH batteries for post-2017 HEV 
applications.  We also expect that large-format stacked and/or folded prismatic Li-ion cell

designs will continue to be used for PHEV and EV applications and that NMC/graphite Li-ion 
batteries will be a mature technology for 2017-2025 light-duty vehicle applications. 
 
3.4.3.8 HEV, PHEV and EV System Sizing Methodology 
Battery packs are (and will continue to be) one of the most expensive components for 
EVs, PHEVs and HEVs.  To obtain reasonable cost estimates for electrified vehicles, it was 
therefore important to establish a reliable approach for determining battery attributes for each 
vehicle and class.  Both battery energy content (“size”) and power rating are key inputs used 
to establish costs per ANL’s battery costing model.  For EVs and PHEVs in particular, battery 
size and weight are closely related, and so battery weight must be known as well.  The 
following section details the steps taken to size a battery for 
a) EVs and PHEVs (at various all-electric ranges), 
b) a more simplified separate approach for  MHEVs and HEVs. 
3.4.3.8.1 Battery Pack Sizing for EVs and PHEVs 
Calculation of required battery pack energy requirements for EVs and PHEVs is not 
straightforward.  Because vehicle energy consumption is strongly dependent on weight, and 
battery packs are very heavy, the weight of the battery pack itself can change the energy 
required to move the vehicle.  As vehicle energy consumption increases, the battery size must 
increase for a given range (in the case of EVs and PHEVs) – as a result, vehicle weight 
increases, and per-mile energy consumption increases as well, increasing the battery size, and 
so on. 
EPA built spreadsheets to estimate the required battery size for each vehicle and class 
(reference here?)  Listed below are the steps EPA has taken in these spreadsheets to estimate 
not only battery size, but associated weight for EVs and PHEVs of varying ranges and 
designs. 
1. Establish baseline FE/energy consumption 
2. Assume nominal weight of electrified vehicle (based on weight reduction 
target) 
3. Calculate vehicle energy demand at this target weight 
4. Calculate required battery energy 
5. Calculate actual battery and vehicle weight 
6. Do vehicle weight and battery size match estimated values? 
 
Iterate steps 2-6 until assumed weight reduction target (and nominal vehicle weight) 
reconciles with required battery size and calculated weight of vehicle. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

Baseline vehicle energy consumption is estimated based on a fitted trendline for FE 
vs. inertia weight, or ETW (from FE Trends data for 2008 MY vehicles, table M-80) and 
converting to Wh/mi.  It is shown in Figure 3-21. 
 
 
Figure 3-21: Average fuel economy based on inertia weight (ETW) from FE Trends data 
Then, fuel economy was converted into energy consumption (assuming 33700 Wh 
energy in 1 gallon of gasoline) and used to populate a range of test weights between 2000 and 
6000 lbs.  A linear trendline was used to fit this curve and then applied for estimating generic 
energy consumption for baseline vehicles of a given ETW, and is shown below in Figure 
3-22.

Figure 3-22: Equivalent energy consumption (in Wh/mi) for baseline vehicles 
To calculate battery pack size, the electrified vehicle weight must first be known; to 
calculate vehicle weight, the battery pack size must first be known.  This circular reference 
required an iterative solution.  EPA assumed a target vehicle glider (a rolling chassis with no 
powertrain) weight reduction and applied that to the baseline curb weight.  The resulting 
nominal vehicle weight was then used to calculate the vehicle energy demand. To calculate 
the energy demand (efficiency) of an electric vehicle in Wh/mi, the following information 
was needed: 
• Baseline energy consumption / mpg 
• Efficiency (η) improvement of electric vehicle 
• Change in road loads 
In Table 3-59 below, the following definitions apply: 
• Brake eff (brake efficiency) – the % amount of chemical fuel energy converted to 
energy at the engine crankshaft (or, for batteries, the amount of stored electrical 
energy converted to shaft energy entering the transmission) 
• D/L eff (driveline efficiency) – the % of the brake energy entering the transmission 
delivered through the driveline to the wheels 
• Wheel eff (wheel efficiency) – the product of brake and driveline efficiency

• Cycle eff (cycle efficiency) – the % of energy delivered to the wheels used to 
overcome road loads and power the vehicle  (it does not include energy lost as 
braking heat) 
• Vehicle efficiency – the product of wheel and cycle efficiency 
• Road loads – the amount of resistant energy the vehicle must overcome during a 
city/highway test.  Composed of vehicle weight (inertia), aerodynamic drag and 
rolling resistance 
Table 3-59: EV efficiency and energy demand calculations 
 
The energy efficiency of a baseline vehicle (around 15%), as indicated in the table 
above, was estimated using efficiency terms derived from EPA’s lumped parameter model 
(engine/battery brake efficiency, driveline efficiency, cycle efficiency and road load ratio to 
baseline).  To calculate the energy consumption of an EV (or PHEV in charge-depleting 
mode), the following assumptions were made: 
• “Brake” efficiency (for an EV, the efficiency of converting battery energy to 
tractive energy at the transmission input shaft) was estimated at 85% - assuming, 
roughly a 95% efficiency for the battery, motor, and power electronics, 
respectively. 
• The driveline efficiency (including the transmission) was comparable to the value 
calculated by the lumped parameter model for an advanced 6-speed dual-clutch 
transmission at 93%. 
• The cycle efficiency assumes regenerative braking where 95% recoverable braking 
energy is recaptured.  As a result, most of the energy delivered to the wheels is 
used to overcome road loads.

• The road loads were based on the weight reduction of the vehicle.  In the case of a 
100 mile EV with a 10% weight reduction, road loads (as calculated by the LP 
model) are reduced to 91% of the baseline vehiclell. 
The energy consumption of the EV includes ratio of the roadloads of the EV to the 
baseline vehicle, and the ratio of the efficiency of the EV compared to the baseline 
vehicle.  It is expressed mathematically as shown below in Equation 3-1:  EV 
energy consumption

In the table 3-x, the baseline energy required (in Wh/mi) is in the column labeled 
“Base fuel energy reqd”.  The energy required for each vehicle class EV over the FTP is in the 
column “FTP fuel energy reqd W-hr/mi” and incorporates the equation above.  This energy 
rate refers to the laboratory or unadjusted test cycle value, as opposed to a real-world 
“onroad” value.  EPA assumes a 30% fuel economy shortfall, based loosely on the 5-cycle 
Fuel Economy Labeling Rule (year) which is directionally correct for electrified vehicles.  
This corresponds to an increase in fuel consumption of 43%.  Applying this 43% increase 
gives the onroad energy consumption values for EVs as shown in the far right column of the 
previous table.  From this value, one can determine an appropriate battery pack size for the 
vehicle.   
The required battery energy for EVs equals the onroad energy consumption, 
multiplied by the desired range, divided by the useful state-of-charge window of the battery.  
It is calculated as follows in Equation 3-2

the 100-mile EV case and show both the onroad energy consumption (“EV adj Wh/mi”

EPA then estimated the weight of the electric drive subsystem using the energy 
content of the battery pack as an input.  EPA scaled the weight by applying a specific energy 
for the electric drive subsystem - including the battery pack, drive motor, wiring, power 
electronics, etc.  – of 120 Wh/kg (or 18.33 lb/kWh).  This specific energy value is based on 
adding components to an assumed battery pack specific energy of 150 Wh/kgmm.  Then, the 
gearbox (the only subsystem excluded from the electric drive scaling) was added to the 
weight of the electric drive subsystem; this total was included into the electric vehicle weight 
calculation as Welectric_drivenn .  A summary table of electric drive weights for 100-mile EVs is 
shown as Table 3-62. 
Table 3-62:  Total electric drive weights for 100-mile EVs 
 
The difference between the actual weight and the predicted or nominal weight should 
be zero.  However, if not then a revised weight reduction was used for another iteration of 
steps 2-6 until the two vehicle weights match.  Spreadsheet tools such as “solver” in MS 
Excel were used for automating this iterative process.

 150 Wh/kg is a conservative estimate for year 2017 and beyond: outputs from ANL’s battery cost model 
show specific energy values of 160- 180 Wh/kg for a similar timeframe.

Table 3-63 shows example results for 100-mile range EVs; in this case a 10% applied 
glider weight reduction for a variety of vehicle classes. 
Table 3-63:  Sample calculation sheet for 100-mile EVs 
 
Table 3-64 shows the effect on net electric vehicle weight reduction after 20% glider 
weight reduction was applied to EVs and PHEVs.  As battery pack size increases for larger-
range EVs and PHEVs, the overall realized vehicle weight reduction decreases (because it 
requires more energy to carry the extra battery weight).  In this example, EVs with a 150 mile 
range require almost 20% weight reduction to the glider to make up for the additional weight 
of the electric drive and battery pack compared to a conventional ICE-based powertrain. 
Table 3-64:  Actual weight reduction percentages for EVs and PHEVs with 20% weight reduction applied 
to glider 
 
Because there is no “all-electric range” requirement for HEVs, battery pack sizes were 
relatively consistent for a given weight class.  Furthermore, because battery pack sizes are at 
least an order of magnitude smaller for HEVs than for all-electric vehicles, the sensitivity of 
HEV vehicle weight (and hence energy consumption) to battery pack size is rather 
insignificant.  For these reasons, a more direct approach (rather than an iterative process) 
works for battery sizing of HEVs. 
• HEV batteries were scaled similar to the 2010 Fusion Hybrid based on nominal 
battery energy per lb ETW (equivalent test weight), at 0.37 Wh/lb. 
• A higher usable SOC window of 40% (compared to 30% for Fusion Hybrid) 
reduced the required Li-Ion battery size to 75% of the Fusion Hybrid’s NiMH 
battery.  This resulted in a 0.28 Wh/lb ETW ratio.

• In comparing anecdotal data for HEVs, the agencies assumed a slight weight 
increase of 4-5% for HEVs compared to baseline non-hybridized vehicles.  The 
added weight of the Li-Ion pack, motor and other electric hardware were offset 
partially by the reduced size of the base engine. 
3.4.3.9 HEV, PHEV and EV battery pack design and cost analysis using the ANL 
BatPac model 
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has established long term industry goals and 
targets for advanced battery systems as it does for many energy efficient technologies. 
Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) was funded by DOE to provide an independent 
assessment of Li-ion battery costs because of their expertise in the field as one of the primary 
DOE National Laboratories responsible for basic and applied battery energy storage 
technologies for future HEV, PHEV and EV applications.  A basic description of the ANL Li-
ion battery cost model and initial modeling results for PHEV applications were published in a 
peer-reviewed technical paper presented at EVS-2457.  ANL has extended modeling inputs 
and pack design criteria within the battery cost model to include analysis of manufacturing 
costs for EVs and HEVs as well has PHEVs.58  In early 2011, ANL issued a draft report 
detailing the methodology, inputs and outputs of their Battery Performance and Cost (BatPac) 
model.59  A complete independent peer-review of the BatPac model and its inputs and results 
for HEV, PHEV and EV applications has been completed60.  ANL recently provided the 
agencies with an updated report documenting the BatPac model that fully addresses the issues 
raised within the peer review.61 Based on the feedback from peer-reviewers, ANL has updated 
the model in the following areas.  
1. Battery pack price is adjusted upward. This adjustment is based on the 
feedback from several peer-reviewers, and changes are related to limiting 
electrode thickness to 100 microns, changing allocation of overhead cost to 
more closely represent a Tier 1 auto supplier, increasing cost of tabs, changing 
capital cost of material preparation, etc;  
2. Battery management system cost is increased to represent the complete 
monitoring and control needs for proper battery operation and safety as shown 
in Table 5.3 in the report; 
3. Battery automatic and manual disconnect unit cost is added based on safety 
considerations as shown in Table 5.3 in the report; 
4. Liquid thermal management system is added. ANL states in the report that the 
closure design it uses in the model does not have sufficient surface area to be 
cooled by air effectively as shown in Table 5.3 in the report. 
  This model and the peer review report are available in the public dockets for this 
rulemaking 60,62.

NHTSA and EPA have decided to use the updated ANL BatPac model, dated July 17, 
2011,  for estimating large-format lithium-ion batteries for this proposal for the following 
reasons.  First, the ANL model has been described and presented in the public domain and 
does not rely upon confidential business information (which would therefore not be 
reviewable by the public).  The model was developed by scientists at ANL who have 
significant experience in this area.  The model uses a bill of materials methodology which the 
agencies believe is the preferred method for developing cost estimates.  The ANL model 
appropriately considers the vehicle applications power and energy requirements, which are 
two of the fundamental parameters when designing a lithium-ion battery for an HEV, PHEV, 
or EV.  The ANL model can estimate high volume production costs, which the agencies 
believe is appropriate for the 2025 time frame.  Finally, the ANL model’s cost estimates, 
while generally lower than the estimates we received from the OEMs, is consistent with some 
of the supplier cost estimates the agencies received from large-format lithium-ion battery pack 
manufacturers.  A portion of those data was received from on-site visits to vehicle 
manufacturers and battery suppliers done by the EPA in 2008.   
The ANL battery cost model is based on a bill of materials approach in addition to 
specific design criteria for the intended application of a battery pack.  The costs include 
materials, manufacturing processes, the cost of capital equipment, plant area, and labor for 
each manufacturing step as well as the design criteria include a vehicle application’s power 
and energy storage capacity requirements, the battery’s cathode and anode chemistry, and the 
number of cells per module and modules per battery pack.  The model assumes use of a 
laminated multi-layer prismatic cell and battery modules consisting of double-seamed rigid 
containers.  The model also assumes that the battery modules are liquid-cooled.  The model 
takes into consideration the cost of capital equipment, plant area and labor for each step in the 
manufacturing process for battery packs and places relevant limits on electrode coating 
thicknesses and other processes limited by existing and near-term manufacturing processes.  
The ANL model also takes into consideration annual pack production volume and economies 
of scale for high-volume production. 
Basic user inputs to BatPaC include performance goals (power and energy capacity), 
choice of battery chemistry (of five predefined chemistries), the vehicle type for which the 
battery is intended (HEV, PHEV, or EV), the desired number of cells and modules, and the 
volume of production.  BatPaC then designs the cells, modules, and battery pack, and 
provides an itemized cost breakdown at the specified production volume.   
BatPaC provides default values for engineering properties and material costs that 
allow the model to operate without requiring the user to supply detailed technical or 
experimental data.  In general, the default properties and costs represent what the model 
authors consider to be reasonable values representing the state of the art expected to be 
available to large battery manufacturers in the year 2020.  Users are encouraged to change 
these defaults as necessary to represent their own expectations or their own proprietary data.   
In using BatPaC, it is extremely important that the user monitor certain properties of 
the cells, modules, and packs that it generates, to ensure that they stay within practical design 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-148 
 
guidelines, adjusting related inputs if necessary.  In particular, pack voltage and individual 
cell capacity should be limited to appropriate ranges for the application.  These design 
guidelines are not rigidly defined but approximate ranges are beginning to emerge in the 
industry.   
Also inherent in BatPaC are certain modeling assumptions that are still open to some 
uncertainty or debate in the industry.  For some, such as the available portion of total battery 
energy (aka "SOC window") for a PHEV/EV/HEV, the user can easily modify a single 
parameter to represent a value other than the default.  For others, such as the type of thermal 
management employed (BatPaC is limited to liquid cooling and does not support passive or 
active air cooling), or the packaging of cells and modules in a pack (parallel modules are not 
supported), changes can often be made by modifying the relevant cost outputs or performing 
workarounds in the use of the model.   
The cost outputs used by the agencies to determine 2025 HEV, PHEV and EV battery 
costs were based on the following inputs and assumptions. 
EPA selected basic user inputs as follows. For performance goals, EPA used the 
power and energy requirements derived from the scaling analysis described in the previous 
section.  Specifically, these covered each of the seven classes of vehicles (Subcompact, Small 
Car, Large Car, Small Truck, Minivan, Minivan with Towing, Large Truck) under each of the 
five weight reduction scenarios (0%, 2%, 7.5%, 10%, and 20%).  The chosen battery 
chemistries were NMC441-G (for EVs and PHEV40) and LMO-G (for P2 HEVs and 
PHEV20).  Vehicle types were EV75, EV100, EV150 (using the BatPaC "EV" setting); 
PHEV20 and PHEV40 (using the "PHEV" setting), and P2 HEV (using the "HEV-HP" 
setting).  All modules were composed of 32 cells each, with each pack having a varying 
number of modules. Cost outputs were generated for annual production volumes of 50K, 
125K, 250K, and 450K packs. The cost outputs for the 450K production volume are used in 
the NPRM analysis. 
For engineering properties and material costs, and for other parameters not identified 
below, EPA used the defaults provided in the model.   
For design guidelines regarding pack voltage and cell capacity, EPA chose guidelines 
based on knowledge of current practices and developing trends of battery manufacturers and 
OEMs, supplemented by discussions with the BatPaC authors. Specifically: (1) allowable 
pack voltage was targeted to approximately 120V for HEVs and approximately 350-400V for 
EVs and PHEVs (with some EV150 packs for larger vehicles allowed to about 460-600V); (2) 
allowable cell capacity was limited to less than 80 A-hr. 
EPA made several modeling assumptions that differed from the default model: (1) The 
SOC window for PHEV20 was limited to 50% rather than the default 70%. (2) The SOC 
window for HEVs was increased to 40% rather than the default 25%. (3) EV packs were 
modeled as two half-packs to avoid exceeding pack voltage guidelines. Although the model 
provided for a potential solution by placing parallel cells within modules, EPA felt that likely 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-149 
 
industry practices would be better represented by placing parallel modules within a pack, or 
by dividing the pack into two parallel packs for packaging flexibility. Because the model did 
not support parallel modules, each EV pack was modeled as two half-packs, each at half the 
target power and energy, to be installed in parallel. Per ANL recommendation, half-packs 
were modeled at twice the full-pack production volume, the projected half-pack cost was then 
doubled, and costs for the battery management system (BMS), disconnects, and thermal 
management were added only once, and module controls added twice. (4) HEV packs were 
assumed to be air cooled instead of liquid cooled (except for large work trucks and minivans 
with towing, which are still modeled as liquid-cooled). Because the model did not support air 
cooling, EPA replaced the model's projected cost for liquid cooling with a cost for air cooling 
(blower motor, ducting, and temperature feedback) derived from FEV’s teardown studies.   
EPA is working with ANL and investigating the potential for modifying the BatPac model to 
include air cooling as an option 
Additionally, EPA did not include warranty costs computed by BatPaC in the total 
battery cost because these are accounted for elsewhere by means of indirect cost multipliers 
(ICMs).

The cost projections produced by BatPaC are sensitive to the inputs and assumptions 
the user provides. Significant uncertainty remains regarding which will best represent 
manufacturer practice in the year 2020. The battery pack cost projection from BatPac model 
ranges from $167/kWh for EV150 large truck to $267/kWh for PHEV40 large car with NMC 
as chemistry and to $375/kWh for PHEV20 sub-compact car as shown in Table 3-66to Table 
3-71. The agencies note that costs used in the analysis are lower than the costs generally 
reported in stakeholder meetings, which ranged from $300/kW-hour to $400/kW-hour range 
for 2020 and $250 to $300/kW-hour range for 2025. A comparison of BatPac modeling 
results to the costs used in the 2012-2016 final rule and to cost estimates compiled by EPA 
from battery suppliers and auto OEMs is shown in Figure 3-24.  The agencies also reviewed 
publically available PHEV and EV battery cost literature including reports from Anderman63, 
Frost & Sullivan64, TIAX65, Boston Consulting Group66, NRC67 etc. EPA and NHTSA 
anticipate that public comment or further research may lead to the use of different inputs and 
assumptions that may change the cost projections used for the final rule. Due to the the 
uncertainties inherent in estimating battery costs through the 2025 model year, a sensitivity 
analysis will be provided in each agency’s RIA using a a range of costs estimated by DOE 
technical experts to represent a reasonable outer bounds to the results from the BatPaC model. 
In a recent report to NHTSA and EPA, DOE and ANL suggested the following range for the 
sensitivity study with 95% confidence interval after analyzing the confidence bound using the 
BatPac model. The agencies plan to use this suggested range for the sensitivity study.

estimates used by EPA in the 2012-2016 GHG final rule, the BatPaC model results for PHEV20, PHEV40, 
EV75, EV100 and EV150 packages compared to estimates from OEM battery suppliers (2009 dollars, 
markups not included). Multiple points shown for the  BatPaC model results for PHEV 20, PHEV40,  
EV75, EV100 and EV150 reflect the range of energy-specific costs for EPA’s subcompact through large-
car package categories (see Table x for details). A range of OEM estimated battery costs from stakeholder 
meetings is also shown for comparison (red bars) which may or may not reflect additional cost markups. 
While it is expected that other Li-ion battery chemistries with higher energy density, 
higher power density and lower cost will likely be available in the 2017-2025 timeframe, the 
specific chemistries used for the cost analysis were chosen due to their known characteristics 
and to be consistent with both public available information on current and near term HEV, 
PHEV and EV product offerings from Hyundai, GM and Nissan as well as confidential 
business information on future products currently under development.69,70,71,72  The cost 
outputs from the BatPaC model used by the agencies in this analysis are shown in Table 3-66 
through Table 3-71 for different levels of applied weight reduction technology.  We 
differentiate between “applied” weight reduction and “net” weight reduction in this analysis 
due to the fact that in order to achieve the same amount of mass reduction, more mass 
reduction technologies might need to be applied to vehicles with electrifications than with 
traditional powertrain because of the added weight of the electrification systems such as 
battery, and in an effort to make clear that we have estimated vehicle level battery pack 
costs—and motor and other electrified vehicle specific costs—based on the net weight 
reduction of the vehicle.  For example, a typical EV150 battery back and associated motors

and other EV-specific equipment increases vehicle weight roughly 18 percent.  As a result, an 
EV150 that applied 20 percent mass reduction technology (see section 3.4.5.5 for a full 
discussion of mass reduction technologies and costs) would have a net weight reduction of 
only 2 percent.  In such a case, the agencies would estimate mass reduction costs associated 
with a 20 percent applied mass reduction, and EV150 costs associated with only a 2 percent 
net mass reduction (lower net mass reduction results in higher battery pack and motor costs).  
Similarly, HEV battery packs increase vehicle weight by roughly 5 or 6 percent.  Therefore, 
for an HEV with 20 percent applied mass reduction technology—and costs associated with 20 
percent applied mass reduction—would have HEV costs associated with a 15 percent net 
mass reduction.  Furthermore, such an HEV would have an effectiveness level improvement 
associated with a 15 percent net mass reduction rather than a 20 percent net reduction.

Specifically for modeling purposes, both agencies wanted HEV/PHEV/EV battery 
pack costs based on net weight reduction rather than applied weight reduction as shown in 
Table 3-66 through Table 3-71 above.  The agencies did this by first determining the average 
weight differences (applied weight reduction vs net weight reduction) for each of the 7 major 
vehicle classes (subcompact, small car, large car, minivan, small truck, minivan+towing & 
large truck) and each of the electrification types (P2 HEV, PHEV & EV).  Due to the weight 
increases of adding electrification system and battery pack and the weight decreases by 
applying smaller or no conventional internal combustion engine, the net mass reduction for 
HEV, PHEV and EV varies for different electrification package and vehicle classes. For an 
example, for a 20-mile subcompact PHEV, 5% mass reduction of the glider is offset by the 
additional weight of electrification system, i.e. 5% mass reduction needs to be applied to 
glider to achieve a net 0% overall vehicle mass reduction for a PHEV20 subcompact 
passenger car. Those weight reduction differences are shown in Table 3-72.

For example, PHEV40-specific technologies add 12-14% to vehicle weight so that a 
20% applied weight reduction would result in a 6-8% net weight reduction. 
While an EV75 can actually reduce vehicle weight by 1-2% (i.e., battery packs and 
motors weigh less than the removed internal combustion engine and transmission), the 
agencies used a value of 0% where negative entries are shown. 
 
The agencies then generated linear regressions of battery pack costs against percentage 
net weight reduction using the costs shown in Table 3-66 through Table 3-71 and the weight 
reduction offsets shown in Table 3-72.  These results are shown in Table 3-73.

Notes: 
“x” in the equations represents the net weight reduction as a percentage, so a subcompact P2 HEV battery pack with a 20% applied weight 
reduction and, therefore, a 15% net weight reduction would cost (-$177)x(15%)+$716=$689. 
The small truck EV150 regression has no slope since the net weight reduction is always 0 due to the 20% weight reduction hit. 
The agencies did not regress PHEV or EV costs for the minivan+towing and large truck vehicle classes since we do not believe these vehicle 
classes would use the technologies. 
 
For P2 HEV battery packs, the direct manufacturing costs shown in Table 3-73 are 
considered applicable to the 2017MY.  The agencies consider the P2 battery packs technology 
to be on the flat portion of the learning curve during the 2017-2025 timeframe.  The agencies 
have applied a high1 complexity ICM of 1.56 through 2024 then 1.35 thereafter.  For PHEV 
and EV battery packs, the direct manufacturing costs shown in Table 3-73 are considered 
applicable to the 2025MY.  For the PHEV and EV battery packs, the agencies have applied 
the learning curve discussed in Section 3.2.3.  The agencies have applied a high2 complexity 
ICM of 1.77 through 2024 then 1.50 thereafter.  The resultant costs for P2 HEV, PHEV20, 
PHEV40, EV75, EV100 and EV150 battery packs are shown in Table 3-74 through Table 
3-79, respectively.

Because CAFE Volpe model does not use pre-built package and it applies 
technologies as necessary to meet the fuel consumption reduction requirement, cost 
interaction between any particular technology and other technologies has to be flexible so that 
when a technology is picked, the model will automatically look through the cost synergy 
defined in a table and apply cost adjustment accordingly. The total cost for mass reduction 
and electrification is composed of the following four parts. 
(1) Cost of net mass reduction; 
(2) Cost of electrification with zero mass reduction; 
(3) Mass reduction cost synergy for increased or decreased amount of mass 
reduction due to switching from conventional powertrain to electrification 
systems as define in Figure 3-25. For an example, if a midsize passenger car 
needs both10 percent net mass reduction and P2 hybrid to meet the CAFE 
target, the model will need to find the cost of additional 5 percent of mass 
reduction to consider the vehicle weight increase due to switching from 
conventional powertrain system to P2 electrification packages. This additional 
5 percent of mass reduction is calculated starting from 10 percent mass 
reduction, not zero as shown in Figure 3-25 because mass reduction cost versus 
mass reduction percent is not a linear function. The cost increases faster as the 
amount of mass reduction becomes higher. 
(4) Electrification system cost synergy (battery and non-battery components) due 
to mass reduction as defined in Table 3-73 and Table 3-86: Continuing the 
example in the steps above, if a midsize passenger car needs both10 percent 
net mass reduction and P2 hybrid to meet the CAFE target, after calculating 
the costs above, the model will need to find the cost of electrification systems, 
including battery system and non-battery system, with the required net amount 
of mass reduction using the equations in Table 3-73 and Table 3-86. Then the 
delta cost between this cost and the cost calculated in step 2, i.e. electrification 
system cost with zero applied mass reduction is calculated and treated as a cost 
synergy. These cost deltas are normally a negative, i.e. cost reduction, due to 
the downsizing of electrification system resulting from mass reduction. 
The sum of item (3) and (4) in the above list are calculate as cost synergy and store in the cost 
synergy table as defined in NHTSA’s RIA.

The agencies have also carefully reconsidered the power and energy requirements for 
each electrified vehicle type, which has a significant impact on the cost estimates for HEVs, 
PHEVs, and EVs as compared to the estimates used in the 2012-2016 rulemaking.     
The agencies note that, for this analysis, the agencies have assumed batteries will be 
capable of lasting the lifetime of the vehicle, which is consistent with the expected customer 
demands from this technology (as manufacturers have confirmed).    Lastly, the agencies have 
focused attention on an emerging HEV technology known as a P2-hybrid, a technology not 
considered in the 2012-2016 light-duty rule.   
The agencies have also considered, for this analysis, the costs associated with in-home 
chargers expected to be necessary for PHEVs and EVs.  Further details on in-home chargers 
and their estimated costs are presented in Section 3.4.4.   
3.4.3.10 Non-battery costs for MHEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, EVs and FCEVs 
This section addresses the costs of non-battery components which are required for 
electric drive vehicles.  Some of these components are not found in every electric-drive 
vehicle (e.g. an HEV does not have an on-board battery charger as found in a PHEV or EV).  
Others are found in all electric drive vehicles and/or must be scaled to the vehicle type or 
class to properly represent the cost.  The agencies derived the costs of these components from 
the FEV teardown study and the 2010 TAR.  Where appropriate, costs were scaled to vehicle

class and in the case of the motor and inverter, the sizing methodology used for battery sizing 
was applied. 
The electric drive motor and inverter provide the motive power for any electric-drive 
vehicle converting electrical energy from the battery into kinetic energy for propulsion. In an 
electric-drive vehicle, energy stored in the battery is routed to the inverter which converts it to 
a voltage and wave form that can be used by the motor.   
In many cases, such as HEVs, the combined cost of the motor and inverter exceed the 
battery cost.  As batteries become larger in PHEVs and EVs, the battery cost grows faster than 
motor and inverter cost. For this analysis, the agencies used the vehicle power requirement 
calculation discussed in 3.4.3.8 to calculate the required motor and inverter size for each 
vehicle class at each weight reduction point.  Then, for the HEVs and PHEVs, a regression 
was created from the FEV teardown data for motors and inverters and this regression was 
used to calculate the motor and inverter cost for each combination of vehicle class and weight 
reduction.  This regression was $14.48x(motor size in kW)+$763.54.  The results are shown 
as the “Motor assembly” line item in Table 3-80, Table 3-81 and Table 3-82 which show our 
scaled DMC for P2 HEV, PHEV20 and PHEV40, respectively.    
For EVs, the agencies used the motor and inverter cost regression from the 2010 TAR 
(see TAR at page B-21).  Since the FEV teardown was conducted on an HEV Ford Fusion, 
the agencies believe the technology for an EV is different enough to warrant using the TAR 
regression.  The regression presented in the TAR showed the DMC being equal to 
$8.28x(motor size in kW)+$181.43.  The results are presented as separate line items for 
“Motor inverter” and “Motor assembly” in Table 3-83, Table 3-84 and Table 3-85 which 
show our scaled DMC for EV75, EV100 and EV150, respectively.   
In addition to electric drive motors and inverters, there are several other components 
in electric drive vehicles that are required.  These components include the following:  
• Body Modifications which are required on HEVs and PHEVs include changes to 
sheet metal to accommodate electric drive components and the addition of 
fasteners to secure components such as electric cables.  These costs come from the 
FEV teardown and are scaled by vehicle class.  For EVs, these costs are assumed 
to be included in the base vehicle because they are less likely to be adapted from 
conventional vehicles. 
• Brake System changes include the addition of a braking system that can control the 
vehicle’s regenerative braking system—a key enabler of electric drive vehicle 
efficiency.  The brake system costs are from the FEV teardown and are scaled to 
vehicle class. 
• Climate Control System includes components such as an electric air conditioning 
compressor that enables operation while the engine is off for HEVs and PHEVs as 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-164 
 
well as for an EV which has no engine.  Climate control system costs come from 
the FEV teardown and are scaled to vehicle class. 
• Conventional vehicle battery and alternator are deleted in these vehicles, for a cost 
savings, replaced by the DC-DC converter which converts the high-voltage 
traction battery to a nominal 12V DC to operate the vehicle’s accessories.  This 
credit comes from the FEV teardown study and is scaled to vehicle class. 
• DC-DC converter converts the high-voltage battery voltage to a nominal 12V 
battery voltage to run vehicle accessories such as the radio, lights and wipers.  This 
cost comes from the FEV teardown study and is scaled to vehicle class. 
• Power distribution and Control consists of those components which route 
electricity to the motor, inverter and contains the controllers to operate and 
monitor the electric drive system.  This cost applies to HEVs and PHEVs and 
comes from the FEV teardown study.  It is scaled to vehicle class. 
• On-Vehicle Charger consists of the components necessary to charge a PHEV or 
EV from an outlet.  It includes the charging port, wiring and electronics necessary 
to convert a 120V or 240V AC input to the high-voltage DC power necessary to 
charge the battery.  Because the FEV teardown study subject vehicle did not have 
an on-vehicle charger, the costs from the TAR were used for this item.  It is not 
scaled to vehicle class, however the EV charger is assumed to cost twice the 
amount of the PHEV charger to account for a higher current capacity.  This cost 
does not include off-vehicle charger components which are discussed in Section 
3.4.4, below. 
• Supplemental heating is required for passenger comfort on PHEVs and EVs which 
may operate for long periods with no engine heat available.  This cost comes from 
the FEV teardown study and is scaled to vehicle class.  The supplemental heater on 
the EV is assumed to be three times more costly than the PHEV because the entire 
cabin comfort is dependent on the supplemental heater.  In a PHEV, it is assumed 
that in extreme conditions, the internal combustion engine will start to provide 
additional cabin heat and defrost functions. 
• High Voltage Wiring is an item used on EVs only.  It includes the high voltage 
cabling from the battery to the inverter and motor as well as control components.  
It is equivalent to the power distribution and control used on HEVs and PHEVs 
and comes from the FEV teardown study.  It is scaled to vehicle class. 
• Delete Internal Combustion Engine and Transmission For EVs, the engine and 
transmission are deleted and a credit is applied.  These credits come from work 
done in support of the 2010 TAR and are scaled to vehicle class.

Similar to the approach taken for battery pack costs, the agencies generated linear 
regressions of non-battery system costs against percent of net mass reduction and the results 
are shown in Table 3-86. This was done using the same weight reduction offsets as used for 
battery packs as presented in Table 3-72.  The agencies separated battery pack costs from the 
remainder of the systems for each type of electrified vehicle.  The advantage of separating the 
battery pack costs from other system costs is that it allows each to carry unique indirect cost 
multipliers and learning effects which are important given that battery technology is an 
emerging technology, while electric motors and inverters are more stable technologies.

Notes: 
“x” in the equations represents the net weight reduction as a percentage, so the non-battery components for a subcompact P2 HEV with a 
20% applied weight reduction and, therefore, a 15% net weight reduction would cost (-$323)x(15%)+$1,691=$1,643. 
The small truck EV150 regression has no slope since the net weight reduction is always 0 due to the 20% weight reduction hit. 
The agencies did not regress PHEV or EV costs for the minivan+towing and large truck vehicle classes since we do not believe these vehicle 
classes would use the technologies. 
 
For P2 HEV non-battery components, the direct manufacturing costs shown in Table 
3-86 are considered applicable to the 2017MY.  The agencies consider the P2 non-battery

3.4.4 Hardware costs for charging grid-connected vehicles 
Grid-connected vehicles such as EVs and PHEVs require a means to charge their on-
board batteries to enable their electric range capabilities.  These vehicles require certain 
hardware to charge, both on-vehicle and off-vehicle. The agencies’ September 2010 Technical 
Assessment Report contains an in-depth analysis of the topic of charging and infrastructure.  
The TAR analysis and assumptions did not receive any significant comment, and a review of 
the current state of the industry indicates the assumptions in the TAR are still valid.  
Therefore, the assumptions for the cost of Electric Vehicle Support Equipment (EVSE) are 
unchanged.  Additionally, while some of the characteristics of the modeled grid-connected 
vehicles such as battery size and energy demand have changed somewhat due to further 
analysis, the application of Level 1 and Level 2 charging by vehicle type based on charge time 
has not changed. 
Three charging levels are currently under consideration.   Level 1 charging uses a 
standard 120 volt (V), 15-20 amps (A) rated (12-16 A usable) circuit and is available in 
standard residential and commercial buildings.  Level 2 charging uses a single phase, 240 V, 
20-80 A circuit and allows much shorter charge times.  Level 3 charging—sometimes 
colloquially called “quick” or “fast” charging—uses a 480 V, three-phase circuit, available in 
mainly industrial areas, typically providing 60-150 kW of off-board charging power.  It is

expected that 97 to 99% of charging will take place at home, so a cost for a home charger, 
appropriate to the duty cycle of the vehicle, is added to the vehicle cost.  Level 3 charging is 
available to commercial users and vehicles that charge at Level 3 stations will be assumed to 
pay at the charge station for the convenience of fast charging.  Therefore Level 3 charger 
costs are not included in overall vehicle cost. 
The specific equipment required for charging a grid-connected vehicle consists of the 
following: 
 Charger: A charger that converts electricity from alternating current (AC) from the 
electricity source to direct current (DC) required for the battery, and also converts the 
incoming 120 or 240 volt current to 300 or higher volts.  Grid-connected vehicles carry an on-
board charger capable of accepting AC current from a wall plug (Level 1 circuit) or, from a 
Level 2 charging station.  On-board charger power capability ranges from 1.4 to 10 kW and is 
usually proportional to the vehicle’s battery capacity.  The lowest charging power, 1.4 kW, is 
expected only when grid-connected vehicles are connected to 120 volt (Level 1) outlets, and 
all currently known PHEV and EV on-board chargers are expected to provide at least 3.3 kW 
charging when connected to a Level 2 (220 volt, 20+ A) charging station.  The latest SAE 
connection recommended practice, J1772, allows for delivery of up to ~19 kW to an on-board 
vehicle charger.  For higher capacity charging under Level 3, a charging station that delivers 
DC current directly to the vehicle’s battery is incorporated off-board in the wall or pedestal 
mounted. 
Charging Station: The charging station needed to safely deliver energy from the 
electric circuit to the vehicle, called electric vehicle support equipment (EVSE).  The EVSE 
may at a minimum, be a specialized cordset that connects a household Level 1/120V socket to 
the vehicle; otherwise, the EVSE will include a cordset and a charging station (a wall or 
pedestal mounted box incorporating a charger and other equipment).  Charging stations may 
include optional advanced features such as timers to delay charging until off-peak hours, 
communications equipment to allow the utility to regulate charging, or even electricity 
metering capabilities.  Stakeholders are working on which features are best located on the 
EVSE or on the vehicle itself, and it is possible that redundant capabilities and features may 
be present in both the vehicle and EVSEs in the near future until these issues are worked out.  
EVSE and vehicle manufacturers are also working to ensure that current SAE-compliant 
“basic” EVSEs are charge-compatible with future grid-connected vehicles. 
Dedicated Circuit: A Level 1 circuit is standard household current, 120V AC, rated at 
15 or 20 A (12 or 16 A usable).  A Level 2 circuit is rated at 208 to 240V and up to 80 A and 
is similar to the type of circuit that powers electric stoves (up to 50 A) and dryers (usually 30 
A).  Generally, Level 1 and 2 circuits used for electric vehicle recharging must be dedicated 
circuits, i.e., there cannot be other appliances on that circuit.  For a Level 2 circuit, the 
homeowner or other user must install a charging station and will need a permit. A homeowner 
may choose to install the charger on a separately-metered circuit to take advantage of special 
electrical rates for off-peak charging, where available.

In addition to the costs of purchasing and installing charging equipment, charging 
station installation may include the costs of upgrading existing electrical panels and installing 
the electrical connection from the panel to the desired station location.  These costs may be 
dramatically lowered if new construction incorporates the panel box and wiring required for 
charging stations, or even includes charging stations or outlets for charging stations as 
standard equipment. 
The current costs of charging stations are highly variable depending on the level of 
service (and alternative power capabilities within these categories), location (individual 
residence, grouped residences, retail or business, parking lot or garage), level of sophistication 
of the station, and installation requirements, including electrical upgrading requirements.  
Estimated costs for charging stations are included in Table 3-93 below.

3.4.4.1 Application of charging level by vehicle type 
The home charging availability for a specific consumer will need to be differentiated 
among EV/PHEVs with different battery capacity.  The electric outlets in existing homes are

most likely ready for Level 1 charging, which is about sufficient for fully recharging a 
PHEV20 SUV during normal nighttime, provided the outlet is not being heavily utilized by 
other loads.  Shorter available charging time or owning a PHEV or an EV with a larger 
battery make the capability to fully charge overnight with a Level 1 system less likely, but 
upgrading to a Level 2 system in such cases will allow full recharge to happen more quickly. 
Table 3-94 shows the application of charge level by vehicle type and range.  Charging 
types were chosen based on nominal time to charge a fully-depleted battery in a vehicle with 
0% net weight reduction.  Charge times exceeding 9 hours for Level 1 were deemed 
unacceptable and Level 2 charging was specified.  For charge times between 6 hours and 9 
hours on Level 1, a mix of Level 1 and Level 2 was specified.  This was done to recognize the 
varying consumer value of faster, but more expensive, Level 2 charging over Level 1 
charging.

For this proposal, the resultant costs associated with in-home chargers and installation 
of in-home chargers are included in the total cost for an EV and or PHEV.  However, here we 
summarize specially the costs for chargers and installation labor.  The agencies have 
estimated the DMC of a level 1 charge cord at $30 (2009$) based on typical costs of similar 
electrical equipment sold to consumers today and that for a level 2 charger at $202 (2009$). 
Labor associated with installing either of these chargers is estimated at $1,009 (2009$). 
Further, we have estimated that all PHEV20 vehicles (PHEVs with a 20 mile range) would be 
charged via a level 1 charger and that all EVs, regardless of range, would be charged via a 
level 2 charger. For the PHEV40 vehicles (PHEVs with a 40 mile range), we have estimated 
that: 25% of subcompacts would be charged with a level 1 charger with the remainder 
charged via a level 2 charger; 10% of small cars would be charged with a level 1 charger with 
the remainder charged via a level 2 charger; and all remaining PHEV 40 vehicles would be 
charged via a level 2 charger. All costs presented here are considered applicable in the 2025 
model year. The agencies have applied the learning curve presented in Section 3.2.3 to all

charger costs.  The agencies have also applied a High1 ICM of 1.56 through 2024 then 1.34 
thereafter.  Installation costs, being labor costs, have no learning impacts or ICMs applied.

3.4.5 Other Technologies Assessed that Reduce CO2 and Improve Fuel Economy 
In addition to the technologies already mentioned, the technologies generally 
considered in the agencies’ analysis are described below.  They fall into five broad categories:  
engine technologies, transmission technologies, vehicle technologies, electrification/accessory 
technologies, hybrid technologies and mass reduction 
3.4.5.1 Lower Rolling Resistance Tires  
Tire rolling resistance is the frictional loss associated mainly with the energy 
dissipated in the deformation of the tires under load and thus influences fuel economy and 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-186 
 
CO2 emissions.  Other tire design characteristics (e.g., materials, construction, and tread 
design) influence durability, traction (both wet and dry grip), vehicle handling, and ride 
comfort in addition to rolling resistance.  A typical low rolling resistance tire’s attributes 
could include: increased specified tire inflation pressure, material changes, and tire 
construction with less hysteresis, geometry changes (e.g., reduced aspect ratios), and 
reduction in sidewall and tread deflection.  These changes would generally be accompanied 
with additional changes to vehicle suspension tuning and/or suspension design. 
The agencies expect that greater reductions in tire rolling resistance will be possible 
during the rulemaking timeframe than are currently available, as tire manufacturers continue 
to improve their products in order to meet increasing demand by auto OEMs for tires that 
contribute more to their vehicles’ fuel efficiency.  Thus, for this proposal, the agencies are 
considering two “levels” of lower rolling resistance tires.  The first level (“LRR1”) is defined 
as a 10 percent reduction in rolling resistance from a base tire, which was estimated to be a 1 
to 2 percent effectiveness improvement MYs 2012-2016 final rule.  Based on the 2011 
Ricardo study the agencies are now using 1.9% for all classes.  LRR1 tires are widely 
available today, and appear to comprise a larger and larger portion of tire manufacturers’ 
product lines as the technology continues to improve and mature.  The second level (“LRR2”) 
is defined as a 20 percent reduction in rolling resistance from a base tire, yielding an 
estimated 3.9 percent effectiveness.  In the CAFE model this results in a 2.0% incremental 
effectiveness increase form LRR1.  LRR2 represents an additional level of rolling resistance 
improvement beyond what the agencies considered in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking 
analysis. 
In the 2012-2016 light duty vehicle rule, the agencies estimated the incremental DMC 
at an increase of $5 (2007$) per vehicle.  This included costs associated with five tires per 
vehicle, four primary and one spare with no learning applied due to the commodity based 
nature of this technology.  Looking forward from 2016, the agencies continue to apply this 
same estimated DMC adjusted for 2009 dollars.oo  The agencies consider LRRT1 to be fully 
learned out or “off” the learning curve (i.e., the DMC does not change year-over-year) and 
have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018, and then 1.19 thereafter, due to the 
fact that this technology is already well established in the marketplace.   
To analyze the feasibility and cost for a second level of rolling resistance 
improvement, EPA, NHTSA, and CARB met with a number of the largest tire suppliers in the 
United States.  The suppliers were generally optimistic about the ability of tire rolling 
resistance to improve in the future without the need to sacrifice traction (safety) or tread life 
(durability).  Suppliers all generally stated that rolling resistance levels could be reduced by 
20 percent relative to today’s tires by MY 2017. As such, the agencies agreed, based on these

 As noted elsewhere in this chapter, we show dollar values to the nearest dollar.  However, dollars and cents are 
carried through each agency’s respective analysis.  Thus, while the cost for lower rolling resistance tires in the 
2012-2016 final rule was shown as $5, the specific value used in that rule was $5.15 (2007$) and is now $5.31 
(2009$).  We show $5 for presentation simplicity.

discussions, to consider LRR2 as initially available for purposes of this analysis in MY 2017, 
but not widespread in the marketplace until MYs 2022-2023.  In alignment with introduction 
of new technology, the agencies limited the phase-in schedule to 15 percent of a 
manufacturer’s fleet starting in 2017, and did not allow complete application (100 percent of a 
manufacturer’s fleet) until 2023.  The agencies believe that this schedule aligns with the 
necessary efforts for production implementation such as system and electronic systems 
calibration and verification. 
LRR2 technology does not yet exist in the marketplace, making cost estimation 
challenging without disclosing potentially confidential business information. To develop a 
transparent cost estimate, the agencies relied on LRR1 history, costs, market implementation, 
and information provided by the 2010 NAS report.  The agencies assumed low rolling 
resistance technology (“LRR1”) first entered the marketplace in the 1993 time frame with 
more widespread adoption being achieved in recent years, yielding approximately 15 years to 
maturity and widespread adoption.  
Then, using MY 2017 as the starting point for market entry for LRR2 and taking into 
account the advances in industry knowledge and an assumed increase in demand for 
improvements in this technology, the agencies interpolated DMC for LRR2 at $10 (2009$) 
per tire, or $40 ($2009) per vehicle.  This estimate is generally fairly consistent with CBI 
suggestions by tire suppliers.  The agencies have not included a cost for the spare tire because 
we believe manufacturers are not likely to include a LRR2 as a spare given the $10 DMC.  In 
some cases and when possible pending any state-level requirements, manufacturers have 
removed spare tires replacing them with tire repair kits to reduce both cost and weight 
associated with a spare tire.77 The agencies consider this estimated cost for LRR2 to be 
applicable in MY 2021.  Further, the agencies consider LRR2 technology to be on the steep 
portion of the learning curve where costs would reduce quickly in a relative short amount of 
time.  The agencies have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2024, and then 1.19 
thereafter.  The ICM timing for LRR2 is different from that for LRR1 because LRR2 is brand-
new for this rulemaking and is not yet being implemented in the fleet.  The resultant costs are 
shown in Table 3-96.  Note that both LRR1 and LRR2 are incremental to the baseline system, 
so LRR2 is not incremental to LRR1.

Note that both levels of lower rolling resistance tires are incremental to today’s baseline tires. 
 
Given that the proposed standards cover such a long timeframe, the agencies also 
considered introducing a third level of rolling resistance reduction (“LRR3”), defined as a 30 
percent reduction in rolling resistance.  The agencies evaluated the potential of LRR3 entering 
the marketplace during this proposed rulemaking timeframe.  
Tire technologies that enable improvements of 10 and 20 percent have been in 
existence for many years.  Achieving improvements up to 20 percent involves optimizing and 
integrating multiple technologies, with a primary contributor being the adoption of a silica 
tread technology.78  This approach was based on the use of a new silica along with a specific 
polymer and coupling agent combination.  The use of the polymer, coupling agent and silica 
was known to reduce tire rolling resistance at the expense of tread wear, but new approach 
novel silica reduced the tread wear tradeoff. 
Tire suppliers have indicated there are one or more innovations/inventions that they 
expect to occur in order to move the industry to the next quantum reduction of rolling 
resistance.  However, based on the historical development and integration of tire technologies, 
there appears to be little evidence supporting improvements beyond LRRT2 by 2025.  
Therefore, the agencies decided not to incorporate LRRT3 at this time.  
The agencies seek comment, however, on whether we should consider application of a 
30 percent reduction from today’s rolling resistance levels being available for mass 
production implementation by MY 2025 or sooner.  The agencies seek comment on the 
viability of this technology, maturity by MY 2025, as well as market introduction timing and 
the technological ways that this level of rolling resistance improvement will be achieved 
without any tradeoffs in terms of vehicle handling capability and tire life from what 
consumers expect today.  Finally, the agencies appreciate any cost information regarding the 
potential incorporation of LRRT3 relative to today’s costs as well as during the timeframe 
covered by this proposal. 
3.4.5.2 Low Drag Brakes  
Low drag brakes reduce the sliding friction of disc brake pads on rotors when the 
brakes are not engaged because the brake pads are pulled away from the rotating disc either 
by mechanical or electric methods 
The 2012-2016 final rule and TAR estimated the effectiveness of low drag brakes to 
be as much as 1 percent.  NHTSA and EPA have slightly revised the effectiveness down to 
0.8% based on the 2011 Ricardo study and updated lumped-parameter model. 
  In the 2012-2016 rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $57 (2007$).  This DMC 
becomes $58 (2009$) for this analysis.  The agencies consider low drag brake technology to 
be off the learning curve (i.e., the DMC does not change year-over-year) and have applied a

3.4.5.3 Front or Secondary Axle Disconnect for Four-Wheel Drive Systems 
Energy is required to continually drive the front, or secondary, axle in a four-wheel 
drive system even when the system is not required during most operating conditions.  This 
energy loss directly results in increased fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.  Many part-time 
four-wheel drive systems use some type of front axle disconnect to provide shift-on-the-fly 
capabilities. The front axle disconnect is normally part of the front differential assembly. As 
part of a shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive system, the front axle disconnect serves two basic 
purposes.  First, in two-wheel drive mode, it disengages the front axle from the front driveline 
so the front wheels do not turn the front driveline at road speed, saving wear and tear.  
Second, when shifting from two- to four-wheel drive “on the fly” (while moving), the front 
axle disconnect couples the front axle to the front differential side gear only when the transfer 
case’s synchronizing mechanism has spun the front driveshaft up to the same speed as the rear 
driveshaft.  Four-wheel drive systems that have a front axle disconnect typically do not have 
either manual- or automatic-locking hubs.  To isolate the front wheels from the rest of the 
front driveline, front axle disconnects use a sliding sleeve to connect or disconnect an axle 
shaft from the front differential side gear.  NHTSA and EPA are not aware of any 
manufacturer offering this technology in the U.S. today on unibody frame vehicles; however, 
it is possible this technology could be introduced by manufacturers within the MYs 2017-
2025 time period.   
The 2012-2016 final rule estimated an effectiveness improvement of 1.0 to 1.5 percent 
for axle disconnect.  Based on the 2011 Ricardo report, NHTSA and EPA refined this range to 
1.2 to 1.4 percent.  
In the 2012-2016 rule, the agencies estimated the DMC at $78 (2007$) which was 
considered applicable to the 2015MY.  This DMC becomes $81 (2009$) for this analysis.  
The agencies consider secondary axle disconnect technology to be on the flat portion of the 
learning curve and have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 
thereafter.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-98.

3.4.5.4 Aerodynamic Drag Reduction  
Many factors affect a vehicle’s aerodynamic drag and the resulting power required to 
move it through the air.  While these factors change with air density and the square and cube 
of vehicle speed, respectively, the overall drag effect is determined by the product of its 
frontal area and drag coefficient.  Reductions in these quantities can therefore reduce fuel 
consumption and CO2 emissions.  Although frontal areas tend to be relatively similar within a 
vehicle class (mostly due to market-competitive size requirements), significant variations in 
drag coefficient can be observed.  Significant changes to a vehicle’s aerodynamic 
performance may need to be implemented during a redesign (e.g., changes in vehicle shape).  
However, shorter-term aerodynamic reductions, with a somewhat lower effectiveness, may be 
achieved through the use of revised exterior components (typically at a model refresh in mid-
cycle) and add-on devices that are currently being applied.  The latter list would include 
revised front and rear fascias, modified front air dams and rear valances, addition of rear deck 
lips and underbody panels, and lower aerodynamic drag exterior mirrors. 
The 2012-2016 final rule estimated that a fleet average of 10 to 20 percent total 
aerodynamic drag reduction is attainable which equates to incremental reductions in fuel 
consumption and CO2 emissions of 2 to 3 percent for both cars and trucks.  These numbers 
are generally supported by the Ricardo study and public technical literature and therefore NHTSA and 
EPA are retaining these estimates, as confirmed by joint review, for the purposes of this proposal.   
For this proposal, the agencies are considering two levels of aero improvements.  The 
first level is that discussed in the 2012-2016 final rule and the 2010 TAR and includes such 
body features as air dams, tire spats, and perhaps one underbody panel.  In the 2012-2016 
rule, the agencies estimated the DMC of aero-level 1 at $39 (2007$).  This DMC becomes 
$40 (2009$) for this analysis, applicable in the 2015MY.  The agencies consider aero-level 1 
technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have applied a low complexity 
ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.   
The second level of aero—level 2 which includes such body features as active grille 
shutterspp, rear visors, larger under body panels or low-profile roof racks —was discussed in 
the 2010 TAR where the agencies estimated the DMC at $120 (2008$) incremental to the

baseline vehicle.  The agencies inadvertently used that cost as inclusive of aero-level 1 
technologies when it should have been incremental to aero-1 technologies.  As a result, the 
agencies now consider the TAR cost to more appropriately be incremental to aero-level 1 with 
a DMC for this analysis of $121 (2009$).  The agencies consider this cost to be applicable in 
the 2015MY.  Further, the agencies consider aero-level 2 technology to be on the flat portion 
of the learning curve.  The agencies have applied a medium complexity ICM of 1.39 through 
2024 then 1.29 thereafter.  The timing of the aero-level 2 ICMs is different than that for the 
level 1 technology because the level 2 technology is newer and not yet being implemented in 
the fleet.  The resultant costs are shown in Table 3-99.

3.4.5.5 Mass Reduction 
Over the past 20 years, there has been a generally increasing trend in the weight of the 
light duty vehicle fleet as shown in Figure 3-26 from EPA’s Fuel Economy Trends Report.79  
There have been a number of factors contributing to this weight increase including 
manufacturers choosing to build and consumers choosing to purchase larger vehicles 
including heavier trucks, SUVs, and CUVs. Also contributing to this weight increase has been 
an increase in vehicle content including; safety features (air bags, antilock brakes, energy 
absorbent and intrusion resistant vehicle structures, etc.), noise reduction (additional damping 
material), added comfort (air conditioning), luxury features (infotainment systems, power 
locks and windows), etc.   
This increased weight in the fleet has been partially enabled by the increased 
efficiency of vehicles, especially in engines and transmissions.  The impressive improvements 
in efficiency during this period have allowed for greater weight carrying and volume capacity 
(and towing), safety, consumer features and vehicle refinement, as well as greater acceleration 
performance.

Since 1987, on average, the overall fleet has become heavier and faster while fuel 
economy has not shown marked or consistent increases. A calculation by University of 
California Davis80 shows the combined impact of the fleet getting heavier while having 
approximately stable fuel economy from 1987 to 2009 in ton-mpg terms. The improvement in 
the fleet’s technical efficiency is illustrated below in Figure 3-27. During the same period, 
there are many improvements in vehicle performance, such as faster vehicle acceleration 
shown in Figure 3-27 and reduced fatality in the fleet as shown in Figure 3-28.

Reducing a vehicle’s mass, or “down-weighting” the vehicle, decreases fuel 
consumption by reducing the energy demand needed to overcome forces resisting motion.  
Mass reduction can be also achieved by vehicle “downsizing” where a vehicle is physically 
reduced in size by reducing exterior dimensions, such as shifting from a midsize vehicle to a 
compact vehicle. Both vehicle down-weighting and vehicle downsizing can yield lower GHG 
emission and reduce fuel consumption. But vehicle downsizing is dependent on the consumer 
choices which are influenced by many factors, such as the consumer’s utility needs, fuel 
prices, economic conditions, etc. qq In this NPRM analysis, the agencies are not analyzing 
downsizing since we are assuming that the attribute based standards will not exert any 
regulatory pressure for manufacturers to change the size of vehicles in order to come into 
compliance with the proposed standards (as described in Section II.F of the Preamble and 
Chapter 2 of the joint TSD).  Instead we are assuming that manufacturers will favor down-
weighting of a vehicle through material substitution, design optimization and adopting other 
advance manufacturing technologies while not compromising a vehicle’s attributes and 
functionalities, such as occupant or cargo space, vehicle safety, comfort, acceleration 
performance, etc. While keeping everything else constant, the lighter a vehicle is, the less fuel 
is needed to drive the vehicle over a driving cycle. Researchers and industry have used a rule 
of thumb, based on testing and simulation, that 10 percent reduction in vehicle mass can be 
expected to generate a 6 to 7 percent increase in fuel economy if the vehicle powertrain and 
other components are also downsized accordingly.82 A recent 2010 Ricardo study, funded by 
EPA, updated this range to 5 to 8 percent increase in fuel economy. 
Mass reduction has an important relationship with vehicle powertrain selection and 
sizing. Vehicle powertrain selection depends on an OEM’s product strategy, and may include 
a variety of options such as: naturally aspirated, boosted and downsized gasoline, diesel, or 
vehicle electrification (P/H/EV).  Regardless of the strategy selected, vehicle mass reduction 
for non-powertrain systems is an important enabler to further reduce vehicle fuel consumption 
and reduce the size of the powertrain system. Often times the term “glider” is used to include 
all of the vehicle parts except for the powertrain of the vehicle. Figure 3-29 illustrates a 
typical vehicle system mass breakdown83. Normally the non-powertrain systems account for 
75 percent of vehicle weight and this is what the agencies are focusing on for this discussion.

 Vehicle mass reduction is very different that vehicle “down-sizing”. Vehicle downsizing can confuse or confound the 
analysis of mass-reduction technology trends; however these are distinctly different factors.

Figure 3-29 Vehicle system mass approximation 
 
Mass reduction can potentially be applied to any of a vehicle’s subsystems, including 
the engine, exhaust system, transmission, chassis, suspension, brakes, body, closure panels, 
glazing, seats and other interior components, engine cooling systems, and HVAC systems. 
Manufacturers generally tend to undertake larger amounts of mass reduction systematically 
and more broadly across all vehicle systems when redesigning a vehicle. For example, if a 
manufacturer applies a smaller, lighter engine with lower torque-output to a vehicle, this can 
allow the use of a smaller, lighter-weight transmission and drive line components, because 
those components need not be as heavy and robust to support equivalent performance in the 
redesigned vehicle with a smaller engine.  Likewise, the combined mass reductions of the 
engine, drivetrain, and body in turn reduce stresses on the suspension components, steering 
components, wheels, tires, and brakes, which can allow further reductions in the mass of these 
subsystems.  Reducing the unsprung masses such as the brakes, control arms, wheels, and 
tires further reduce stresses in the suspension mounting points which will allow for further 
optimization and potential mass reduction. When redesigning vehicles, OEMs normally set 
weight targets by benchmarking other vehicles in the same segment and projecting weight 
trends into the future, and then identifying targets for all components and subsystems that 
support achieving the target.  The agencies believe this holistic approach, taking into 
consideration of all secondary mass savings, is the most effective way for OEMs to achieve 
large amount of mass reduction.  During a vehicle redesign where mass reduction is a 
strategic vehicle program goal, OEMs can consider modular systems design, secondary mass 
effects, multi-material concepts, and new manufacturing processes to help optimize vehicles 
for much greater potential mass reduction. Figure 3-30 illustrates an example of this approach 
and how significant mass reduction opportunities can be achieved when a complete vehicle 
redesign is undertaken.

Figure 3-30 Summary of Lotus Engineering Low and High Development vehicle projects 
 
It is appropriate for both manufacturers and the agencies to consider mass reduction in 
terms of “percent by which the redesigned vehicle is lighter than the previous version,” 
recognizing that that percent likely represents both “primary” mass reduction (that which the 
manufacturer set out to make lighter) and “secondary” mass reduction (from ancillary systems 
and components that can now be lighter due to having made the primary mass reductions).  
As in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking analysis, the agencies are assuming that up to 
1.25 kg of secondary mass reduction can occur for each kg of primary mass reduction, when 
all subsystems are redesigned to take the initial primary mass reduction into account.84  We 
note that this estimate may not be applicable in all real-world instances of mass reduction, and 
that the literature indicates that the amount of secondary mass reduction potentially available 
varies significantly from an additional 50% to 125% depending on what is assumed, such as 
which components or systems primary mass reduction is applied to, and whether the 
powertrain is available for downsizing.  85  86   87  The ability to reduce mass is affected by the 
consideration of component sharing among different vehicles to achieve production 
economies of scale that affect cost and that also affect the number of unique parts that must be 
managed in production and for service.  In addition, the engineering resources and capital for 
tooling and equipment that would be needed to optimize every vehicle component at each 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-197 
 
redesign affects the ability to fully optimize a new vehicle to achieve all of the theoretically 
possible secondary mass reduction.  While there is agreement in the literature that primary 
mass reduction can enable secondary mass reduction, the agencies recognize that care must be 
taken when reviewing reports on mass reduction methods and practices to ascertain if 
compounding effects have been considered and how. 
Mass reduction can occur through a variety of techniques available to manufacturers. 
As summarized by NAS in its 2011 report, there are two key strategies for reducing vehicle 
mass, changing the design to use less material or substituting light-weighting materials for 
heavier materials while maintaining performance (safety and stiffness).88 The first approach is 
to use less material comparing to the baseline component by optimizing the design and 
structure of the component, system or vehicle structure. For an example, a “body on frame” 
vehicle can be redesigned with a lighter “unibody” construction by eliminating the number of 
components and reducing the weight of the overall body structure, resulting in significant 
mass reduction and related cost reduction. The unibody design dominates the passenger car 
segment and has an increasing penetration into what used to be body-on-frame vehicles, such 
as SUVs. This technique was used in the 2011 Ford Explorer redesign in addition to extensive 
use of high strength steels89. Figure 3-31 depicts body-on-frame and unibody designs for two 
sport utility vehicles.. . 
 
Figure 3-31 Illustration of Body-on-Frame (BoF) and Unibody vehicle construction 
 
Manufactures can also continue to utilize Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tools to 
further reduce inefficiencies in vehicle design. For example, the Future Steel Vehicle (FSV) 
project90 sponsored by the WorldAutoSteel, used three levels of optimization, topology 
optimization, low fidelity 3G (Geometry Grade and Gauge) optimization and sub-system 
optimization, to achieve 30 percent mass reduction in vehicle body structure with a unibody 
design. Designs similar to some used in the FSV project have been applied in production 
vehicles, such as the B-pillar of new Ford Focus.91 An example of this process in shown in the 
Future Steel Vehicle project shown in Figure 3-32.

3-199 
 
Vehicle manufacturers have long used these continually-improving CAE tools to 
optimize vehicle designs. But because any design must maintain component and system 
functionality, there are practical limitations to the amount of additional design improvement 
and mass reduction that can be achieved through optimization.  Additionally, ultimate 
optimization of vehicle design for mass reduction may be limited by OEMs’ typical use of a 
common platform for multiple vehicle models.   While optimization may concentrate of the 
vehicle that has the largest production volume for a platform, designs must also support the 
most demanding functional requirements of all of the vehicles that share that platform. In 
addition, the engineering resources and capital for tooling and equipment that would be 
needed to optimize every vehicle component at each redesign affects the ability to fully 
optimize a new vehicle to achieve all of the theoretically possible secondary mass reduction.  
Therefore, it is inherent that some level of mass inefficiency will exist on many or all of the 
vehicles that share a platform. The agencies seek comment and information on the degree to 
which shared vehicle components and architectures affect the feasible amount of mass 
reduction and the cost for mass reduction relative to what could be achieved if mass reduction 
was optimized for a single vehicle design.  
Using less material can also be achieved through improving the manufacturing 
process, such as by using improved joining technologies and parts consolidation.  This 
method is often used in combination with applying new materials. For example, more precise 
manufacturing techniques, such as laser welding, may reduce the flange size necessary for 
welding and thus marginally decrease the mass of an assembly.  Also, when complex 
assemblies are constructed from fewer pieces, the mass of the assembly tends to be lower.  
Additionally, while synergies in mass reduction certainly exist, and while certain technologies 
(e.g., parts consolidation and molding of advanced composites) can enable one another, others 
(e.g., laser welding and magnesium casting) may be incompatible.   
The second key strategy to reduce mass of an assembly or component involves the 
substitution of lower density and/or higher strength materials. Table 3-100 shows material 
usage typical to high-volume vehicles. Material substitution includes replacing materials, such 
as mild steel, with advanced and regular higher-strength steels, aluminum, magnesium and/or 
composite materials.  The substitution of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) can reduce the 
mass of a steel part because AHSS has higher strength than mild steel and therefore less 
material is needed in strength-critical components despite the fact that its density is not 
significantly different from mild steel.  Some manufacturers are considering even more 
advanced materials for many applications, but the advanced microstructure and limited 
industry experience with some materials may make these longer-term solutions.  For example, 
advanced composite materials (such as carbon fiber-reinforced plastic), depending on the 
specific fiber, matrix, reinforcement architecture, and processing method, can be subject to 
dozens of competing damage and failure mechanisms that may complicate a manufacturer’s 
ability to ensure equivalent levels of durability and crashworthiness.  As the industry gains 
experience with these materials, these concerns will inevitably diminish, but may remain 
relevant during the timeframe of this rulemaking.  Material substitution also tends to be quite 
manufacturer and situation specific in practice; some materials work better than others for 
some vehicle components and a manufacturer may invest more heavily in adjusting its 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-200 
 
manufacturing to a particular type of advanced material and complicate its ability to consider 
others.  The agencies recognize that like any type of mass reduction, material substitution has 
to be conducted not only with consideration to maintaining equivalent component strength, 
but also to maintaining all the other attributes of that component, system or vehicle, such as 
crashworthiness, durability, and noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). 
Automobiles also utilize a wide range of plastic types, including polypropylenes, 
polyesters, and vinyl esters. These materials are utilized in hatches, roofs, interior panels, 
instrument panels, and hundreds of other parts. Although primarily replacing nonstructural 
vehicle components, plastics have continued to make in-roads in bumper systems and in 
composite beam applications and a number of studies have found potential to supplant 
structural beams and frame component. Additionally included in this general category are the 
more costly composites, like glass fiber and carbon fiber reinforced polymers. These 
materials, to date, are used primarily in limited applications in low-production-volume 
vehicles.  
 
Table 3-100 Distribution of Material in Typical Contemporary Vehicles (e.g. Toyota Camry and Chevrolet 
Malibu) 
 
If vehicle mass is reduced sufficiently, a manufacturer may use a smaller, lighter, and 
potentially more efficient powertrain while maintaining vehicle acceleration performance.  If 
a powertrain is downsized, approximately half of the mass reduction may be attributed to the 
reduced torque requirement which results from the lower vehicle mass.  The lower torque 
requirement enables a reduction in engine displacement, changes to transmission torque 
converter and gear ratios, and changes to final drive gear ratio. The reduced powertrain torque 
enables the downsizing and/or mass reduction of powertrain components and accompanying 
reduced rotating mass (e.g., for transmission, driveshafts/halfshafts, wheels, and tires) with 
similar powertrain durability. 
All manufacturers are using some or all of these methods to some extent to reduce 
mass in the vehicles they are producing today, and the agencies expect that the industry will 
continue to learn and improve the application of these techniques for more vehicles during the 
rulemaking timeframe.  We consider mass reduction in net percentage terms in our analysis 
not only because effectively determining specific appropriate mass reduction methods for 
each vehicle in the baseline fleet is a large task beyond the scope of this rulemaking, but also 
because we recognize that even as manufacturers reduce mass to make vehicles more 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-201 
 
efficient, they may also be adding mass in the form of increased vehicle content, some of 
which is feature and safety content in response to market forces and other governmental 
regulations.  For these reasons, when the agencies discuss the amount of mass reduction that 
we are assuming is feasible for purposes of our analysis, we are implicitly balancing both the 
considerable opportunities that we believe exist for mass reduction in the future, and the 
reality that vehicle manufacturing is complex and that mass reduction methods must be 
applied thoughtfully and judiciously as safety and content demands on vehicles continue to 
increase over time.  Despite our considerable discussion of the topic, the agencies’ application 
of mass reduction in our analysis is fairly simplified. As applied in our models, the percentage 
reduction for a given vehicle that is assumed for a given year is an abstraction for the use of 
all the mass reduction methods described above (and in the literature search portion of the 
above cost discussion).  This represents the significant complexity of mass reduction 
technologies for improving fuel economy and reducing CO2 emissions.  
 
How much mass reduction do the agencies believe is feasible in the rulemaking timeframe? 
Feasibility, if narrowly defined as the ability to reduce mass without any other 
constraints, is nearly unbounded.  However, the feasible amount of mass reduction is affected 
by other considerations. Cost effectiveness is one of those constraints and is discussed in the 
cost section, above.  In the analysis for the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, NHTSA assumed 
different amounts of mass reduction (defined as net reduction of a percentage of total vehicle 
mass) were feasible for different vehicle subclasses in different model years.  In addition, it 
was assumed that more mass was taken out at a redesign and/or later in the rulemaking 
timeframe than at a refresh and/or earlier in the rulemaking timeframe.  More specifically, 
NHTSA assumed that mass could be reduced 1.5 percent at any refresh or redesign, and that 
mass could be reduced an additional incremental 3.5-8.5 percent (3.5 for smaller vehicles, 8.5 
for the largest vehicles) at redesigns after MY 2014 to provide leadtime for these larger mass 
reduction amounts.  The amount (percentage) of mass reduction that the NHTSA used in the 
analysis generally aligned with information that the agencies received, during the MY 2012-
2016 rulemaking, from manufacturers related to their plans to reduce mass of larger vehicles 
more than smaller vehicles in the 2012-2016 timeframe.  Based on the NHTSA’s analysis, it 
was estimated that mass reduction in response to the MY 2012-2016 program would achieve a 
safety-neutral result.   
In the analysis for the current rulemaking for MYs 2017-2025, the agencies reviewed 
a number of public reports and accompanying data, as well as confidential information from 
manufacturers and believe that mass reduction of up to 20 percent can be achieved in a cost 
effective manner using technologies currently in production.  More detail on studies reviewed 
by the agencies and additional studies currently in progress by the agencies is located in Table 
3-103 and Preamble section II.G. 
From a general planning perspective, nearly all automakers have made some public 
statement regarding vehicle mass reduction being a core part of the overall technology 
strategy that they will utilize to achieve future fuel economy and CO2 emission standards.

Estimates from Ducker Worldwide indicate that the automobile industry will see an annual 
increase in AHSS of about 10% through 202092. Ford has stated that it intends to reduce the 
weight of its vehicles by 250-750 lb per model from 2011 to 202093. For context, the midpoint 
of that range of reductions would correspond to a 12% reduction from the current Ford new 
light duty vehicle sales fleet. Similarly, Nissan has a target of a 15% mass reduction per 
vehicle by 201594. This reduction would represent over a 500-lb reduction from their 2008 
light duty vehicle average. Mazda’s has released a statement about achieving a 220-lb 
reduction per vehicle by 201695.  This is equivalent to about a 6% reduction for the company’s 
current fleet.  Toyota stated that it could end up reducing the mass of the Corolla and mid-size 
models by 30% and 10%, respectively, in the 2015 timeframe. The low end of those targets, 
10%, is equivalent to 350 lb per Toyota vehicle in 2008. Land Rover remains committed to a 
goal of reducing curb weights of its S.U.V.’s by as much as 500 kilograms over the next 10 
years96. Several reports are summarized in the University of California study as shown in 
Table 3-10197.98 
 
Table 3-101 Automaker industry statements regarding plans for vehicle mass-reduction technology 
 
 
The agencies also believe the practical limits of mass reduction will be different for each 
vehicle model as each model starts with a different mix of conventional and advanced 
materials, components, and features intended to meet the function and price of a particular 
market segment.  A vehicle that already has a significant fraction of advanced high strength 
steel (AHSS) or any other advanced material in its structure, for example, will not have the 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-203 
 
opportunity to realize the same percentage of mass reduction as a vehicle of more traditional 
construction.  Given the myriad methods of achieving mass reduction, and the difficulty in 
obtaining data, accounting for the current level of mass reduction technology for every model 
in production in a baseline model year would be an impractical task.  However, the agencies 
believe that reducing vehicle weight to reduce fuel consumption has a continuum of solutions 
and the technologies employed will have levels of effectiveness and feasibility that will vary 
by manufacturers and by vehicle.   In estimating the amount of mass reduction for this 
analysis, the agencies also consider fleet safety effects for mass reduction. See the Preamble 
II.G for a detailed discussion of the safety considerations in establishing CAFE and GHG 
standards.  In the CAFE and OMEGA analyses, the agencies considered several levels of 
mass reduction to all of the models in each subclass as discussed below.  
Based on the many aspects of mass reduction (i.e. feasibility, cost and safety) , for the 
proposal the agencies believe that mass reduction of up to 20 percent is feasible on light 
trucks, CUVs and minivans, but that less mass reduction should be implemented on other 
vehicle types to avoid increases in societal fatalities.  While the agencies continue to examine 
mass reduction further, we remain alert to safety considerations and seek to ensure that any 
CAFE and CO2 standards can be achieved in a safety-neutral manner.     
In the CAFE model, NHTSA applied the amounts of mass reduction shown in Table 
3-102, which enabled us to achieve overall fleet fatality estimates of close to zero. 
Table 3-102 MASS REDUCTION AMOUNT APPLIED IN CAFE MODEL 
 
The amounts of mass reduction shown in Table 3-102, however, are for conventional 
vehicles.  The amount of mass reduction applied in the OMEGA model follows the safety 
neutral analysis approach described in Section II.G of the Preamble.  The results are described 
on a variety of tables within EPA’s draft RIA (Chapter 3.8.2).  The agencies assume that 
vehicles with hybrid and electric powertrain are heavier than conventional vehicles because of 
the mass of battery systems.  In comparing anecdotal data for HEVs, EPA and NHTSA 
assumes a slight weight increase of 4-5% for HEVs compared to baseline non-hybridized 
vehicles.  The added weight of the Li-ion pack, motor and other electric hardware were offset 
partially by the reduced size of the base engine as stated in TSD section 3.4.3.8. This 
assumption, which we believe accurately, reflects real-world HEV, PHEV and EV

construction, as an example, for a subcompact PHEV with 20 mile range operating on 
electricity, because of the additional weight of the electrification system, the agencies assume 
that to achieve no change in total vehicle mass, it would be necessary to reduce the mass of 
the glider (the vehicle without the powertrain), by 6 percent.  The mass reduction for P/H/EVs 
can be found section 3.4.3.9 in TSD, section 3.4.3.8 and in EPA’s RIA Chapter 1 and 
NHTSA’s RIA Chapter V section E.3.h.4. 
 
How much do the agencies estimate mass reduction will cost in the rulemaking timeframe? 
 
Automakers are currently utilizing various mass reduction techniques across the light-
duty vehicle fleet, and will continue to use and in some cases expand these approaches for the 
2017 to 2025 time frame.  These approaches may include optimized design, geometry, part 
consolidations, and materials substitution.  Unlike the other technologies described in this 
chapter, mass reduction is potentially more complex in that we cannot define it as a single 
piece of equipment or hardware change to implement the technological improvement.  Mass 
reduction, depending upon the level of reduction targeted, has the potential to impact nearly 
every system on the vehicle.  Because of this complexity, there are unique challenges to 
estimating the cost for mass reduction and for demonstrating the feasibility of reducing 
vehicle mass by a given amount.  This section describes the cost estimates used for the 
agencies’ analysis.   
In the analysis for the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, the agencies assumed a constant 
cost for mass reduction of $1.32 for each pound reduced up to a mass reduction level of 10 
percent (or $1.48/lb using an ICM factor of 1.1 for a low-complexity technology).  The 
$1.32/lb estimate was based on averaging three studies: the 2002 NAS Report, a 2008 study 
by Sierra Research, and a 2007 study by MIT researchers.rr 
Since the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies have given further consideration to 
the cost of mass reduction, and now believe that a cost that varies with the level of mass 
reduction provides a better estimate.  The agencies believe that as the vehicle fleet progresses 
from lower to higher levels of mass reduction and becomes increasingly optimized for mass 
and other attributes, the cost for mass reduction will progressively increase.  The higher levels 
of mass reduction may, for example, require applying more advanced materials and 
technologies than lower levels of mass reduction, which means that the cost of achieving 
those higher levels may increase accordingly.  The unit cost of mass reduction versus the

 Specifically, the 2002 NAS Report estimated that vehicle weight could be reduced by 5 percent (without 
engine downsizing) at a cost of $210-$350, which translates into $1.50/lb assuming a 3,800 lb base vehicle and 
using the midpoint cost; Sierra Research estimated that a 10 percent reduction (with compounding) could be 
accomplished for $1.01/lb, and MIT researchers estimated that a 14 percent reduction (with no compounding) 
could be accomplished for $1.36/lb.  References for these studies are available in endnotes to Chapter 3 of the 
TSD for the MYs 2012-2016 final rule.

amount of mass reduction might be linear, parabolic, or some other higher order relationship.  
In the 2017-2025 Notice of Intent, 75 FR 62739 (Oct. 13, 2010),  CARB, EPA and NHTSA 
derived a second order curve based on a study with two vehicle redesigns conducted by Lotus 
Engineering completed in 2010, such that zero mass reduction had zero cost, and the dollars 
per pound increased with greater levels of mass reduction.  Since the publication of the TAR, 
the agencies have identified a number of additional studies in the literature relating to the 
costs of vehicle mass reduction, which are discussed below.  The studies show that for low or 
high mass reduction, the costs can range from small cost savings to significant cost increases. 
The economic costs associated with mass reduction are difficult to determine conclusively 
due to the broad range of methods s employed to achieve mass reduction.  The costs on a 
specific vehicle or component depend on many factors, such as the design, materials selected, 
raw material price, appropriate manufacturing processes, production volume, component 
functionality, required engineering and development, etc.  Cost data thus varies widely in the 
literature.  Of the various studies reviewed by the agencies, not all are equal in their original 
intent, rigor, transparency, or applicability to this regulatory purpose. The individual studies 
range from complete vehicle redesign to advanced optimization of individual components, 
and were conducted by researchers with a wide range of experience and background.  Some 
of the studies were literature reviews, while others developed new designs for lighter 
components or complete lighter vehicles, while yet others built physical components or 
systems, and conducted testing on those components and systems.  Some of the studies 
focused only on a certain sub-system (which is a building block for the overall vehicle 
design), while some of them took a systematical approach and re-designed the whole vehicle 
to achieve the maximum mass reduction and cost reduction. The latter studies typically 
identified a specific baseline vehicle, and then utilized different engineering approaches and 
investigated a variety of mass-reduction concepts that could be applied to that vehicle.  Some 
of the differences between studies emanate from the characteristics of the baseline vehicle and 
its adaptability to the new technology or method, and the cost assumptions relating to the 
original components and the redesigned components.  Assumptions regarding the degree and 
cost of any associated mass decompounding can also confound comparisons.ss    Despite this 
variation in the literature, in actual practice, we believe manufacturers will choose a target 
mass reduction for a whole vehicle and for each sub-system, and work to find the lowest total 
cost method to achieve those targets.  Such a process would consider numerous primary and 
                                                 
ss
 The concept of secondary weight savings or mass compounding (also called mass decompounding) derives 
from the qualitative understanding that as vehicle weight decreases, other vehicle systems can also decrease in 
mass while maintaining the original vehicle level of performance and function. For instance, following a primary 
weight reduction in the vehicle (e.g. Body in White), the designs of some of the other dependant vehicle 
subsystems (tires, suspensions, brakes,  powertrain, body structure) may be redesigned and reduced in mass to 
account for the overall lighter vehicle. The lighter vehicle is also associated with lighter loads, less friction and 
drag, and may require less power to be accelerated, and the powertrain may therefore be scaled down in size with 
a potential for reduced mass, even while maintaining equivalent acceleration performance and functionality. The 
compounded or secondary mass savings from these additional systems may then drive further mass reductions in 
the original primary weight reduction (e.g. Body in White). Mass compounding factors found in literature are 
rough estimates of the secondary mass reduction amount.

secondary cost factors (including engineering, facilities, equipment, tooling, and retraining 
costs) as well as technological and manufacturing risks.tt   
Regardless of the confidence in specific estimates, the agencies must select a curve 
that will be applied to the whole fleet that will define the average cost per pound of mass 
reduction as a function of total percentage of mass reduction.  There are many significant 
challenges that make it difficult for the agencies to establish an estimated cost curve based on 
the literature, such as the differences in the baselines used in the studies, whether the studies 
considered platform sharing and powertrain sharing, and other considerations.  The agencies 
initially considered using the flat rate cost estimate that was used for the last rulemaking, 
$1.32/lb, but as discussed above, there are appropriate reasons to consider a variable cost 
curve.  The agencies then considered the cost estimates from the TAR, but have noted that 
there is more data available at present that could potentially be useful in informing our 
estimates.  Nonetheless, coalescing these disparate datasets into a single curve has limitations 
since the various studies are not directly comparable.    
With these challenges in mind, and because the agencies have not finished the 
significant mass reduction studies targeted for the CAFE and GHG rulemaking (described 
below), the agencies examined all the studies in Table 3-103 including information supplied 
by manufacturers (during meetings held subsequent to the TAR) when deciding the mass 
reduction cost estimate used for this NPRM.uu  The agencies considered three major factors in 
examining these studies.  First, whether a study was rigorous in terms of how it evaluates and 
validates mass reduction from technological and design perspectives.  This includes 
consideration of a study’s comprehensiveness, the technical rigor of its methodology, the 
validation methods employed, and the relevance of the technologies evaluated in the study 
given our rulemaking time frame.  Second, whether a study was rigorous in terms of its 
estimation of costs, including the completeness and rigor of the methodology, such as whether 
the study includes data for all categories of direct manufacturing costs, and whether the study 
presents detailed cost information for both the baseline and the light-weighted design.  And 
third, the degree of peer review, including if the study is peer-reviewed, and whether it has 
effectively addressed any critical technical, methodological, and cost issues raised by the 
peer-review, if this information is available.   
Some of the variation may be attributed to the complexity of mass reduction as it is 
not one single discrete technology and can have direct as well as indirect effects on other 
                                                 
tt
 We also note that the cost of mass reduction in the Volpe model is quantified on a per pound basis that is a 
function of the percentage decrease in vehicle mass.  We assume that OEMs would find the most cost-effective 
approach to achieve such a mass reduction.  Realistically, this would depend heavily on the baseline vehicle as 
well as the size and adaptability of the initial design to the new technology. Thus, the Volpe model strives to be 
realistic in the aggregate while recognizing that the figures proposed for any specific model may be debatable. 
uu
 The agencies considered confidential cost information provided by OEMs that covered a range of components, 
systems, designs and materials.  Some of these cost estimates are higher than some of the literature studies, and 
manufacturers provided varying levels of detail on the basis for the costs such as whether mass compounding is 
included, or whether the costs include markup factors. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-207 
 
systems and components.  The 2010 NAS study speaks to this point when it states on page 7-1 
that “The term material substitution oversimplifies the complexity of introducing advanced 
materials, because seldom does one part change without changing others around it.”  These 
variations underscore that there is not a unique mass reduction solution as there are many 
different methods with varying costs for taking mass out of vehicles, and every manufacturer, 
even every vehicle, could have a different approach depending on the specific vehicle, 
assembly plant and model year of implementation.  The agencies recognize that there are 
challenges to characterizing the mass reduction plans for the entire future fleet due to the 
complexity and variety of methods available.  So far the agencies have not found any study 
that addresses how to generalize the mass reduction that is achievable on a single vehicle to 
the whole fleet.  
Table 3-103 contains a summary of the data contained in the studies, and the OEM 
CBI data, which the agencies reviewed.  There is a degree of uncertainty associated with 
comparing the costs from the range of studies in the literature when trying to summarize them 
in a single table, and we encourage interested stakeholders to carefully review the information 
in the literature.  For some of the cost estimates presented in the papers there are unknowns 
such as: what year the costs are estimated for, whether mass decompounding (and potential 
resultant cost savings) was taken into account, and whether mark-ups or indirect costs were 
included.  The agencies tried to normalize the cost estimations from all these studies by 
converting them to 2009 year dollar, applying mass compounding factor of 1.35 for mass 
reduction amount more than 10 percent if it has not been applied in the study and factoring 
out the RPE specified in the study to derive direct manufacture costs for comparison. There 
are some papers that give cost for only component mass reduction, others that have more 
general subsystem costs and others yet that estimate total vehicle mass reduction costs (which 
often include and present data at the subsystem level).  Other studies have multiple scenarios 
for different materials, different vehicle structures and mass reduction strategies.  Thus, a 
single study which contains more than one vehicle can be broken down into a range of vehicle 
types, or at the subsystem level, or even at the component level.  While Table 3-103 is 
inclusive of all of the information reviewed by the agencies, for the reasons described above 
the technical staff for the two agencies applied various different approaches in evaluating the 
information.  The linear mass-cost relationship developed for this proposal and presented 
below is the consensus assessment from the two agencies of the appropriate mass cost for this 
proposal.

Cost Information from Studies
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

EPA and NHTSA scrutinized the various available studies in the literature as well as 
confidential information provided by several auto firms based on the kinds of factors 
described above for purposes of estimating the cost of mass-reduction in the 2017-2025 
timeframe.  We determined that there was wide variation across the studies with respect to 
costs estimates, applicability to the 2017-2025 time frame, and technical rigor.  The mass cost 
curve that was developed this proposal is defined by the following equation: 
 
 Mass Reduction Direct Manufacturing Cost ($/lb) = 4.32 x Percentage of Mass 
Reduction 
 
For example, this results in an estimated  $173 cost increase for a 10% mass reduction of a 
4,000lb vehicle (or $0.43/lb), and a $390 cost increase for 15% reduction on the same vehicle 
(or $0.65/lb).   
Because of the wide variation in data used to select this estimated cost curve, the 
agencies have also conducted cost sensitivity studies in their respective RIAs using values of 
+/-40%.  The wide variability in the applicability and rigor of the studies also provides 
justification for continued research in this field, such as the agency studies discussed below.  
The assessment of the current studies highlights the importance of these agency studies, as 
they are expected to be amongst the most comprehensive ever conducted in the literature, and 
to be more informative than other studies for estimating the cost of mass reduction for 
purposes of rulemaking. 
The agencies consider this DMC to be applicable to the 2017MY and consider mass 
reduction technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve in the 2017-2025MY 
timeframe.  To estimate indirect costs for applied mass reduction of up to 15%, the agencies 
have applied a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 and 1.19 thereafter.  To estimate 
indirect costs for applied mass reduction of 15% to 25%, the agencies have applied a medium 
complexity ICM of 1.39 through 2024 and 1.29 thereafter.  To estimate indirect costs for 
applied mass reduction greater than 25%, the agencies believe it is appropriate to apply a 
high1 complexity ICM of 1.56 through 2024 and 1.35 thereafter. 
The agencies seek detailed comment regarding options for realistically and 
appropriately assessing the degree of feasible mass reduction for vehicles in the rulemaking 
timeframe and the total costs to achieve that mass reduction.  For example, the agencies seek 
comments on what practical limiting factors need to be considered when considering 
maximum feasible amount of mass reduction; the degree to which these limiting factors will 
impact the amount of feasible mass reduction (in terms of the percent of mass reduction); the 
best method(s) to assess an appropriate and feasible fleet-wide amount mass reduction amount 
(because each study mainly focuses on a single vehicle); etc.  If commenters wish to submit 
additional studies for the agencies’ consideration, it would assist the agencies if commenters 
could address how the studies also contribute to the agencies’ understanding of the issues 
enumerated above.  The agencies also note that we expect to refine our estimate of both the 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-211 
 
amount and the cost of mass reduction between the NPRM and the final rule based on the 
ongoing work described below.  
How effective do the agencies estimate that mass reduction will be? 
In the analysis for the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, NHTSA and EPA estimated that a 
10 percent mass reduction with engine downsizing would result in a 6.5 percent reduction in 
fuel consumption while maintaining equivalent vehicle performance (i.e., 0-60 mph time, 
towing capacity, etc.), consistent with estimates in the 2002 NAS report.  For small amounts 
of mass reduction, such as the 1.5 percent used at vehicle refresh in NHTSA’s modeling, no 
engine downsizing was used, so a 10 percent mass reduction without engine downsizing was 
assumed to result in a 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption.  In this NPRM, both 
agencies have chosen to use the effectiveness value for mass reduction from EPA’s lumped 
parameter model to maintain consistency.  EPA’s lumped parameter model-estimated mass 
reduction effectiveness is based on a simulation model developed by Ricardo, Inc. under 
contract to EPA.  The 2011 Ricardo simulation results show an effectiveness of 5.1 
percent for every 10 percent reduction in mass.  NHTSA has assumed that for mass 
reduction less than 10 percent the effectiveness is 3.5 percent.  For mass reduction greater 
than 10 percent, NHTSA estimates the effectiveness is 5.1 percent which avoids double 
counting benefits – because the effectiveness of engine downsizing is included in the 
effectiveness of the engine decision tree when applying engine downsizing, it should 
appropriately be removed from the mass reduction effectiveness value in the mass reduction 
decision tree.  EPA applies an effectiveness of 5.1 percent for every 10 percent mass 
reduction, and this scales linearly from 0 percent mass reduction, up to the maximum 
applied mass reduction for any given vehicle, which in this proposal is never larger than 
20 percent. 
What additional studies are the agencies conducting to inform our estimates of mass 
reduction amounts, cost, and effectiveness? 
In the MYs 2012-2016 final rule, the agencies stated that there are several areas 
concerning vehicle mass reduction and vehicle safety on which the agencies will focus their 
research efforts and undertake further study.  Some studies focus on the potential safety 
effects of mass reduction through fleetwide analyses, and thus help to inform the agencies 
with regard to how much mass reduction might appropriately be deemed feasible in the 
rulemaking timeframe, while others focus on the cost and feasibility of reducing mass in 
specific vehicles.  The results of all of these studies are currently expected to be available for 
the final rule, and should contribute significantly to informing the agencies’ estimates of the 
costs and feasible amounts of mass reduction to be included in that analysis.  The following is 
an update for the status of those studies. 
The agencies and independent researchers have several vehicle level projects to 
determine the maximum potential for mass reduction in the MY 2017-2021 timeframe by 
using advanced materials and improved designs while continuing to meeting safety 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

regulations and maintaining functionality of vehicles, and one study that will investigate the 
effects of resultant designs on fleet safety: 
• NHTSA has awarded a contract to Electricore, with EDAG and George Washington 
University (GWU) as subcontractors, to study the maximum feasible amount mass 
reduction for a mid-size car – specifically, a Honda Accord.  The study tears down a 
MY 2011 Honda Accord, studies each component and sub-system, and then redesigns 
each component and sub-system trying to maximize the amount of mass reduction with 
technologies that are considered feasible for 200,000 units per year production volume 
during the time frame of this rulemaking.  Electricore and its sub-contractors are 
consulting industry leaders and experts for each component and sub-system when 
deciding which technologies are feasible.  Electricore and its sub-contractors are also 
building detailed CAD/CAE/powertrain models to validate vehicle safety, stiffness, 
NVH, durability, drivability and powertrain performance.  For OEM-supplied parts, a 
detailed cost model is being built based on a Technical Cost Modeling (TCM) 
approach developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Materials 
Systems Laboratory’s research99 for estimating the manufacturing costs of OEM parts.  
The cost will be broken down into each of the operations involved in the 
manufacturing, such as for a sheet metal part production by starting from blanking the 
steel coil, until the final operation to fabricate the component.  Total costs are then 
categorized into fixed cost, such as tooling, equipment, and facilities; and variable 
costs such as labor, material, energy, and maintenance. These costs will be assessed 
through an interactive process between the product designer, manufacturing engineers 
and cost analysts.  For OEM-purchased parts, the cost will be estimated by consultation 
with experienced cost analysts and Tier 1 system suppliers. This study will help to 
inform the agencies about the feasible amount of mass reduction and the cost 
associated with it.  NHTSA intends to have this study completed and peer reviewed 
before July 2012, in time for it to play an integral role in informing the final rule.  
• EPA has awarded a contract to FEV, with EDAG and Monroe & Associates, Inc. as 
subcontractors, to study the maximum feasible amount of mass reduction for a mid-size 
CUV (cross over vehicle) specifically, a Toyota Venza.  The study tears down a MY 
2010 vehicle, studies each component and sub-system, and then redesigns each 
component and sub-system trying to maximize the amount of mass reduction with 
technologies that are considered feasible for high volume production for a 2017 MY 
vehicle. FEV in coordination with EDAG is building detailed CAD/CAE/powertrain 
models to validate vehicle safety, stiffness, NVH, durability, drivability and powertrain 
performance to assess the safety of this new design. This study builds upon the low 
development (20% mass reduction) design in the 2010 Lotus Engineering study “An 
Assessment of Mass Reduction Opportunities for a 2017-2020 Model Year Vehicle 
Program”. This study will undergo a peer review. EPA intends to have this study 
completed and peer reviewed before July 2012, in time for it to play an integral role in

• NHTSA has contracted with GWU to build a fleet simulation model to study the 
impact and relationship of light-weighted vehicle design and injuries and fatalities.  
This study will also include an evaluation of potential countermeasures to reduce any 
safety concerns associated with lightweight vehicles.  NHTSA will include three light-
weighted vehicle designs in this study:  the one from Electricore/EDAG/GWU 
mentioned above, one from Lotus Engineering funded by California Air Resource 
Board for the second phase of the study, evaluating mass reduction levels around 35 
percent of total vehicle mass, and one funded by EPA and the International Council on 
Clean Transportation (ICCT).  This study will help to inform the agencies about the 
possible safety implications for light-weighted vehicle designs and the appropriate 
counter-measures,vv if applicable, for these designs, as well as the feasible amounts of 
mass reduction.  All of these analyses are expected to be finished and peer-reviewed 
before July 2012, in time to inform the final rule. 
Safety considerations in establishing CAFE/GHG standards along with discussion of 
NHTSA’s February 25, 2011, mass-size-safety workshop at DOT headquarters, can be found

when the studies have reached a sufficient level of completion, to share the results with the 
public and seek public comments. 
 
3.5 How did the agencies consider real-world limits when defining the rate at which 
technologies can be deployed? 
3.5.1 Refresh and redesign schedules 
During MYs 2017-2025 manufacturers are expected to go through the normal 
automotive business cycle of redesigning and upgrading their light-duty vehicle products, and 
in some cases introducing entirely new vehicles not in the market today.  The MY 2017-2025 
standards timeframe allows manufacturers the time needed to incorporate GHG reduction and 
                                                 
vv
 Countermeasures could potentially involve improved front end structure, knee bags, seat ramps, buckle 
pretensioners, and others. 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis

fuel-saving technologies into their normal business cycle while considering the requirements 
of the MY 2012-2016 standards..  This is important because it has the potential to avoid the 
much higher costs that could occur if manufacturers need to add or change technology at 
times other than their scheduled vehicle redesigns.  This time period also provides 
manufacturers the opportunity to plan for compliance using a multi-year time frame, again 
consistent with normal business practice.  Over these 9 model years, and the 5 prior model 
years that make up the 2012-2016 standards, there will be an opportunity for manufacturers to 
evaluate, presumably, every one of their vehicle platforms and models and add technology in 
a cost effective way to control GHG emissions and improve fuel economy.  This includes all 
the technologies considered here and the redesign of the air conditioner systems in ways that 
will further reduce GHG emissions and improve fuel economy.   
Because of the complexities of the automobile manufacturing process, manufacturers 
are generally only able to add new technologies to vehicles on a specific schedule; just 
because a technology exists in the marketplace or is made available, does not mean that it is 
immediately available for application on all of a manufacturer’s vehicles.  In the automobile 
industry there are two terms that describe when technology changes to vehicles occur:  
redesign and refresh (i.e., freshening).  Vehicle redesign usually refers to significant changes 
to a vehicle’s appearance, shape, dimensions, and powertrain.  Redesign is traditionally 
associated with the introduction of “new” vehicles into the market, often characterized as the 
“next generation” of a vehicle, or a new platform.  Across the industry, redesign of models 
generally takes place about every 5 years.  However, while 5 years is a typical design period, 
there are many instances where redesign cycles can be longer or shorter.  For example, it has 
generally been the case that pickup trucks and full size vans have longer redesign cycles, 
while high-volume cars have shorter redesign cycles in order to remain competitive in the 
market.  There are many other factors that can also affect redesign such as availability of 
capital and engineering resources and the extent of platform and component sharing between 
models, or even manufacturers.  
Vehicle refresh usually refers to less extensive vehicle modifications, such as minor 
changes to a vehicle’s appearance, a moderate upgrade to a powertrain system, or small 
changes to the vehicle’s feature or safety equipment content.  Refresh is traditionally 
associated with mid-cycle cosmetic changes to a vehicle, within its current generation, to 
make it appear “fresh.”  Vehicle refresh generally occurs no earlier than two years after a 
vehicle redesign or at least two years before a scheduled redesign.  For the majority of 
technologies discussed today, manufacturers will only be able to apply them at a refresh or 
redesign, because their application would be significant enough to involve some level of 
engineering, testing, and calibration work. 
Most vehicles would likely undergo two redesigns during this period. Even with the 
potential of multiple of refresh and redesign cycles, it is still likely that some of the more 
advanced and costly technologies (such as cooled boosted EGR engines, or advanced 
(P)HEVs) may not be able to be fully implemented within the timeframe of this rule.  These 
limitations are captured in “phase-in caps,” discussed in the next section, and “maximum 
technology penetration rates” within the modeling analysis.   
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-215 
 
The broad technology classes evaluated for purposes of this analysis are defined below 
and a brief discussion of the limiting factors considered are presented. 
• Conventional Spark Ignition (SI) - This technology category includes all 
technologies, such as gasoline direct injection engines, cylinder deactivation, six 
and eight speed automatic and dual clutch transmissions, and start-stop micro-
hybrid technology, that are not contained in other categories.  Many of these 
technologies were anticipated as being available in the MYs 2012-2016 time frame 
in the recent NHTSA and EPA final rule, and it is expected manufacturers could 
expand production to all models by model year 2025.  Conventional SI also 
includes turbocharged and downsized engines and turbocharged and downsized 
engines that include cooled EGR with additional levels of boost and a larger 
degree of engine downsizing than seen in the current light-duty gasoline fleet.  
These latter technologies are similar to the technologies that many OEMs indicated 
were underdevelopment and which they anticipate will be introduced into the 
market in the 2017-2025 time frame. 
• Hybrid – While the agencies recognize there are many types of full-hybrids either 
in production or under development, for the purposes of this analysis we have 
specifically modeled the P2 type hybrid, as explained in section 3.4.3.6.3.  While 
the agencies expect the proliferation of these vehicles to increase in this timeframe, 
the maximum technology penetration rate and phase-in caps are set at less than 
100% in MY 2025 due to industry-wide engineering and capacity constraints, for 
converting the entire new vehicle fleet to strong hybrids (like P2 and others) in this 
time frame.  As described these technologies (along with PHEVs and EVs) require 
a significant cost and complexity, and thus are not expected to be able to be fully 
phased into the 2017-2025 fleet like other more conventional (but advanced) 
engines.   
• Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) - This technology includes PHEV’s with a range of 20 and 
40 miles.  The maximum technology penetration rates and phase-in caps are set at 
less than 100% in MY 2025 due to the same general potential constraints as listed 
for the HEVs, but are lower for PHEVs due to the current status of the 
development of these advanced vehicles and the higher cost relative to HEVs.  In 
addition, some consumers may have limited or no access to charging 
infrastructure, and for those consumers, the PHEV offers little benefit over an 
HEV at a higher cost.  Further, we project (based on what we know today) that 
PHEV technology is not available to some vehicle types, such as large pickups.  
While it is technically possible to electrify such vehicles, there are tradeoffs in 
terms of cost, electric range, and utility that may reduce the appeal of the vehicle 
to a narrower market.  However, the agencies are interested in promoting 
innovation to overcome these potential obstacles and are thus incentivizing more 
HEV and PHEV pickup trucks with credit flexibilities as described in the preamble 
for this proposed rule.   
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-216 
 
• Electric Vehicle (EV) - This technology includes vehicles with actual on-road 
ranges of 75, 100, and 150 miles.  The actual on-road range was calculated using a 
projected 30% gap between two-cycle and on-road range.  These vehicles are 
powered solely by electricity and are not powered by any liquid fuels.  The 
maximum technology penetration rates and phase-in caps are set at less than 100% 
in MY 2025 due to the same general potential constraints as discussed for PHEVs.  
EVs have additional constraints due to limited infrastructure and range as well.  
Further, as with PHEVs, we assume that EV technology is not available to some 
vehicle types, such as large pickups.  While it is possible to electrify such vehicles, 
there are tradeoffs in terms of cost, range, and utility that would reduce the appeal 
of the vehicle to a narrower market.  These trade-offs are expected to reduce the 
market for other vehicle types as well, and for this analysis we have considered 
this in the development of the maximum technology penetration rates.   
• Mass Reduction - This technology includes material substitution, smart design, 
and mass reduction compounding.  NHTSA and EPA have conducted a thorough 
assessment of the levels of mass reduction that could be achieved which is both 
technologically feasible and which can be implemented in a safe manner for this 
joint federal NPRM (as described earlier in this Chapter). 
3.5.2 Vehicle phase-in caps 
GHG-reducing and fuel-saving technologies for vehicle applications vary widely in 
function, cost, effectiveness and availability. Some of these attributes, like cost and 
availability vary from year to year. New technologies often take several years to become 
available across the entire market. The agencies use phase-in caps to manage the maximum 
rate that the CAFE and OMEGA models can apply new technologies.  
Phase-in caps are intended to function as a proxy for a number of real-world 
limitations in deploying new technologies in the auto industry.  These limitations can include 
but are not limited to, engineering resources at the OEM or supplier level, restrictions on 
intellectual property that limit deployment, and/or limitations in material or component supply 
as a market for a new technology develops.  Without phase-in caps, the models may apply 
technologies at rates that are not representative of what the industry is actually capable of 
producing, which would suggest that more stringent standards might be feasible than actually 
would be.   
EPA applies the caps on an OEM vehicle platform basis for most technologies.  For a 
given technology with a cap of x%, this means that x% of a vehicle platform can receive that 
technology.  On a fleet average basis, since all vehicle platforms can receive x% of this 
technology, x% of a manufacturer’s fleet can also receive that technology.  EVs and PHEVs 
are an exception to this rule.  Unlike other technologies, which are applicable to all classes of 
vehicles, EPA only allows non-towing vehicle types to be electrified in the OMEGA model.  
As a result, the PHEV and EV cap was applied so that the average manufacturer could 
produce to the cap levels.  Manufacturers that make fewer non-towing vehicles have a lower 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-217 
 
potential maximum production limit of EVs and PHEV, while those that make more non-
towing vehicles have a higher potential maximum limit on EV and PHEV production. 
 NHTSA applies phase-in caps in addition to refresh/redesign cycles used in the CAFE 
model, which constrain the rate of technology application at the vehicle level so as to ensure a 
period of stability following any modeled technology applications, Unlike vehicle-level cycle 
settings, phase-in caps, defined on a percent per year basis, constrain technology application 
at the OEM level.  As discussed above phase-in caps are intended to reflect a manufacturer’s 
overall resource capacity available for implementing new technologies (such as engineering 
and development personnel and financial resources) thereby ensuring that resource capacity is 
accounted for in the modeling process.  At a high level, phase-in caps and refresh/redesign 
cycles work in conjunction with one another to avoid the CAFE modeling process out-pacing 
an OEM’s limited pool of available resources during the rulemaking time frame, especially in 
years where many models may be scheduled for refresh or redesign.  This helps to ensure 
technological feasibility and economic practicability in determining the stringency of the 
standards. 
Phase-in caps do not define market penetration rates and they do not define the rate at 
which a particular technology will be applied, rather they simply present an upper limit, or 
ceiling at which the agencies’ computer models can apply new technologies to vehicles to 
raise their fuel economy and reduce their CO2 emissions.  Ultimately, phase-in caps are 
determined by the agencies using engineering judgment. However, there are several sources 
of information on technology penetration that the agencies consider in assigning phase-in caps 
to various technologies: 
 
• Confidential OEM submissions indicate the rate at which an individual 
manufacturer can deploy a particular technology.  Manufacturer information is 
especially helpful if multiple manufacturers indicate similar technology 
penetration rates.  The agencies consider these CBI submissions along with 
other sources of information. 
• Historical data from EPA’s annual Fuel Economy Trends Report100 is used to 
inform the agencies about typical historical rates of adoption of technologies. 
However, historical data does not necessarily indicate the rates of future 
technology penetration. Increased competition is driving faster vehicle 
redesigns and faster adoption of new technologies.  On the other hand, some 
new technologies such as EVs are significantly more complex than most other 
historical technologies, which must also be considered in defining a phase-in 
rate.  
• Trade press articles, company publications, press releases, and other reports 
often discuss new technologies, how quickly they will be deployed and 
manufacturing strategies that enable faster penetration rates.  These articles 
provide a useful glimpse into how manufacturers are changing in order to 
become more competitive.

3.5.2.1 Trends Report and Industry Data 
For over 30 years, EPA’s Fuel Economy Trends report has tracked the fuel economy 
of light duty vehicles and the technology used by automakers to improve fuel economy.  A 
particularly interesting aspect of the Trends data is how technology is adopted by the industry 
and how this changes over time.  Trends data shows that industry-wide, it has typically taken 
up to 15-20 years for a technology to penetrate the entire fleet.  Some technologies such as 
port fuel injection and variable valve timing start slowly and then rapidly progress.  Others, 
like torque converter lockup and front wheel drive penetrate rapidly after their first 
appearance on the market.  Figure 3-33, below shows these trends. 
 
Figure 3-33 Technology Penetration After First Significant Use101 
There are several cases where technologies have penetrated the fleet rapidly, 
sometimes beginning with significant market penetration, sometimes beginning with 
relatively small market penetration.  For example, six speed automatic transmissions were in 
7% of the industry-wide fleet in 2006 and by 2010, they were in 36% of the fleet, for an 
increase of 29% in 4 yearsww. Port fuel injection went from about 12% of the fleet in 1984 to 
88% in 1994.  Front wheel drive, a technology that requires a complete change in vehicle 
architecture, increased from 9% in 1979 to 60% by 1988102. 
Recent academic literature has also used deployment rate data from the EPA Fuel 
Economy Trends Report, Wards Factory Installed data, and other sources to report to describe 
historical deployment rates of a variety of technologies. (DeCicco, 2010 and Zoepf, 2011).  
DeCicco, for example, cites conversion to fuel injection and front wheel drive in passenger 
cars as having seen maximum growth in adoption of 17% and 11% per year respectively.103

Zoepf examines a broader array of automotive technologies and notes a span of maximum 
growth rates in passenger cars from 4% to nearly 24% per year with variance based on feature 
type.104 
While these examples show that the industry is capable of adopting certain new 
technologies rapidly industry-wide, considering the rate of introduction of technology by 
individual OEMs shows that the pace of technology introduction can in some cases be even 
faster. Table 3-104 below shows how individual manufacturers can apply technologies rapidly 
to a large fraction of their fleet.  Although not typical for most manufacturers and 
technologies, the data below shows that manufacturers have chosen to deploy some 
technologies very rapidly.  
Table 3-104: Historical Phase-In Rates of Selected Technologies

General Motors Lockup Transmission 1980-1982:  83% in 3 years 
Ford Fuel Injection 1983-1987:  91% in 5 years

General Motors Variable Valve Timing 2006-2010:  75% in 5 years 
General Motors Gasoline Direct Injection 2010:  27% in 1 year 
 
Often, a rapid application of technology is helped by having similar vehicle 
architecture, or by sharing major components such as engines or transmissions across multiple 
products.  As discussed below, platform sharing combined with improvements in platform 
and manufacturing flexibility is expected to further enable faster implementation of new 
technologies. 
3.5.2.2 The rate of technology adoption is increasing 
The agencies recognize that new technologies may not achieve rapid deployment 
immediately and that small-scale production is a part of the technology learning process.  To 
this end the phase-in caps distinguish between technologies that have been successfully 
applied in existing vehicles and those that under development but are anticipated on 
production vehicles in the near future. 
The rate of technology adoption appears to be increasing as manufacturers increase 
model turnover and decrease the numbers of unique vehicle platforms. This facilitates a 
steady stream of new products, increased sales and optimized vehicle redesigns allowing and 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-220 
 
fuel consumption-reducing technologies to be applied to as many vehicles as possible.  In 
today’s globally competitive market, and certainly for the U.S., market share and 
competitiveness is strongly influenced by a manufacturer’s ability to turn over their product 
line-up.  Merrill Lynch’s Car Wars Report105  shows that replacement rate is speeding up and 
showroom age is dropping as manufacturers are striving to be more competitive in the market.  
Increased model turn-over creates more opportunity for manufacturers to deploy new 
technologies faster than in the past. 
Zoepf, cited above, reports that the developmental time, from first production 
application to maximum growth rate, has been declining exponentially as manufacturers bring 
innovations to market progressively faster.  Ellison et al. (1995)106 indicate that U.S. and 
European automakers reduced overall product development time by more than a year in the 
1990s.  Ellison et al. point to the increased role that suppliers have had in product 
development process during the same time, potentially commoditizing innovations more 
quickly. 
Vehicle platforms are the basic underpinnings of vehicles and are often shared across 
several unique products. By reducing the number of platforms, and making these platforms 
flexible, manufacturers can better deploy resources to serve a wider market with more 
products.  Utilizing a modern, flexible platform architecture, a manufacturer can produce a 
sedan, wagon, minivan, and a crossover, or SUV on a single platform and all of these 
products can be assembled in a single vehicle assembly plant.  Basic components can be 
developed and purchased at high volumes, while enabling the manufacturer to exploit what 
would otherwise be niche markets.  This commonization of platforms does have the potential 
to increase the mass for lighter vehicle models within the platform because the platform needs 
to be designed for the more severe duty cycle of the SUV and/or larger engine.  Volkswagen 
has recently launched a new platform called MQB, which will be used world-wide by up to 60 
unique models from VW, Audi, Seat, and Skoda. This structure will replace 18 “engine 
mounting architectures” with just two.    
It gives us the possibility to produce models from different segments and in 
varying sizes using the same basic front-end architecture,” …. “We can go from a 
typical hatchback to a saloon, cabriolet and SUV with only detailed changes to the 
size of the wheel carriers.” … it will be used on every model from the new Lupo all the 
way through to the next-generation Sharan.107  
One of the key enablers of this drive to reduce platforms and increase model turn-over 
is increased manufacturing flexibility.108  For example, in 2004, Ford invested in flexible 
manufacturing technology for their Cleveland No. 1 engine plant.  Although the plant was 
shut down for two years after this investment, Ford was able to retool and reopen the plant at 
a low cost to produce their new 3.5L EcoBoost turbocharged, direct injection engine as well 
as their 3.7L V6.109   In their December, 2008 business plan submitted to Congress,110  Ford 
further stated, 
Technologies Considered in the Agencies' Analysis 
3-221 
 
 …nearly all of our U.S. assembly plants will have flexible body shops by 2012 
to enable quick response to changing consumer demands and nearly half of our 
transmission and engine plants will be flexible, capable of manufacturing various 
combinations of transmission and engine families.  
Like VW, Ford is also striving to reduce their platforms and complexity.  In Ford’s 
2008 business plan submitted to Congress, they stated that in addition to divesting themselves 
from certain luxury brands like Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Aston Martin, they were 
working to consolidate their vehicle platforms from 25 in 2005 to 9 by 2012.  Having more 
vehicles per platform frees up resources to deploy new technologies across a greater number 
of vehicles more quickly and increases the rate at which new technologies can be introduced. 
We believe GM’s recent restructuring will also enable faster vehicle redesigns and more rapid 
penetration rates in the 2010-plus time frame compared to the 1990s and 2000s. In the past 
seven years, GM has eliminated five brands (Saturn, Hummer, Saab, Pontiac, and 
Oldsmobile), significantly reducing the number of unique products and platforms the 
company needed to devote engineering resources to. GM has set a goal to halve its number of 
vehicle platforms by 2018 and boost manufacturing efficiency by 40%.111 
3.5.2.3 Phase-in Rates Used in the Analysis 
Table 3-105 below shows phase-in rates for the technologies used in the OMEGA 
model.  OMEGA calculations are based on five year intervals, so phase-in caps are derived 
for model years 2016, 2021 and 2025.  Table 3-106 shows phase-in rates for the technologies 
used in the CAFE model.  The CAFE model calculations are annual, so phase in rates are 
derived for every year of the program.  Where possible, phase-in rates for OMEGA and 
CAFE were harmonized, but there are some differences mainly where technologies differ 
between the agencies. 
Most technologies are available at a rate of either 85% or 100% beginning in 2016. 
Some advanced technologies expected to enter the market in the near future such as EGR 
Boost follow a 3% annual cap increase from 2016 to 2021, then, approximately 10% from 
2021 to 2025.  Diesels follow an annual 3% increase in phase-in cap through 2025.  Hybrids 
follow a 3% annual increase from 2016 to 2012, then 5% from 2021 to 2015. PHEVs and EVs 
follow a 1% annual cap increase. 
Lower phase-in caps for Alternate Fueled Vehicles (AFVs) reflect additional 
investment in infrastructure that is required to achieve high levels of conversion to a new fuel 
type.  These limited phase-in caps also reflect as yet unknown consumer responses to HEVs, 
PHEVs and BEVs.

3.6 How are the technologies applied in the agencies' respective models? 
Although both NHTSA and EPA are basing their fuel economy and emission 
modeling on the same baseline vehicle fleet and cost and effectiveness estimates for control 
technologies, differences in the CAFE and OMEGA models result in  this common 
information being processed in different ways prior to its  use in the respective models.  With 
respect to the vehicle fleet, the CAFE Model evaluates the addition of technology to 
Technology Abbr.

individual vehicle configurations or models, while the OMEGA model does so for vehicle 
platforms broken down further by engine size.  The Volpe (or CAFE) Model evaluates 
technologies individually.  This, coupled with the modeling of individual vehicle models, 
means that only the presence or absence of any particular technology needs to be indicated, as 
described above.  OMEGA applies technology in combinations or packages.  This, plus the 
grouping of individual vehicle models, requires that the total effectiveness of the technology 
already applied in the baseline fleet must be calculated and must be reflected as a percentage 
of the various technology packages available to be added to those vehicles.   
With respect to the cost and effectiveness of technologies, as mentioned above, the 
CAFE Model applies technologies individually.  It does this following certain specified 
pathways for several categories of technologies (e.g., engine, transmission, accessories, etc.).  
The Volpe Model applies technology incrementally, so the effectiveness of each subsequent 
technology needs to be determined relative to the previous one.  The same is true for cost.  In 
addition, because of interaction in the effectiveness of certain technologies, herein referred to 
as the synergy/dis-synergy, any such interaction between the next technology on a specified 
pathway with those which have already been potentially applied in other pathways must be 
determined.  For example, the incremental effectiveness of switching from a six-speed 
automatic transmission to a dual clutch transmission will depend on the level of engine 
technology already applied (e.g., intake cam phasing on a port-fuel injected engine or a down-
sized, turbocharged, direct injection engine).   
EPA’s OMEGA model applies technologies in packages and according to a fixed 
sequence for any particular group of vehicles.  This requires that the overall cost and 
effectiveness of each package be determined first, considering any and all dis-synergies which 
may exist.  Then, the incremental cost and effectiveness of each subsequent package is 
determined relative to the prior one. 
  Thus, while the same baseline vehicle fleet and cost and effectiveness estimates for 
technologies are being used in both the CAFE and OMEGA models, the form of the actual 
inputs to the model will appear to be different.  For more information on EPA’s and 
NHTSA’s unique approaches to modeling, please refer to each agency’s respective 
preliminary or draft RIA.  
In order to estimate both technology costs and fuel consumption/CO2 reduction 
estimates, it is necessary for each agency to describe the baseline vehicle characteristics from 
which the estimates can be compared.  This “baseline” is different from the usage in Chapter 
1 of this joint TSD.  In Chapter 1, the baseline fleet is the projected fleet in MY 2025 before 
accounting for technologies needed to meet the MY 2016 CAFE standards and before 
accounting for changes in fleet composition attributable to that rule (those later steps 
accounted for independently by each agency in developing their separate reference fleets).  In 
the present context, it indicates the vehicle types and technologies that will be used for 
comparison from a strict cost and effectiveness point of view.  These baselines may be 
slightly different for the two agencies.  For EPA, unless noted elsewhere, the baseline vehicle 
is defined as a vehicle with a port-fuel injected, naturally aspirated gasoline engine with fixed

valve timing and lift.  The baseline transmission is a 4-speed automatic, and the vehicle has 
no hybrid systems.  For NHTSA, unless noted elsewhere, the baseline vehicle is the actual 
vehicle as it exists in the baseline fleet, because NHTSA models each unique vehicle 
separately.

Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-2 
 
Chapter 4:  Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies’ 
Analysis  
4.1 How the Agencies use the economic and other assumptions in their analyses  
Improving new vehicles’ fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions provides direct benefits to their buyers and users by reducing fuel consumption and 
fuel costs throughout those vehicles’ lifetimes, stimulating increased vehicle use through the 
fuel economy rebound effect, and often increasing vehicles’ driving range so that they require 
less frequent refueling.   At the same time, the reduction in fuel use that results from requiring 
higher fuel economy and reducing GHGs also produces wider benefits to the U.S. economy 
by lowering the cost of economic externalities that result from U.S. petroleum consumption 
and imports.  This occurs because reducing U.S. oil consumption and imports reduces the 
global price of petroleum, lowers the potential costs from disruptions in the flow of oil 
imports, and potentially reduces federal outlays to secure imported oil supplies and cushion 
the U.S. economy against their potential interruption.  Reducing fuel consumption and GHGs 
also lowers the economic costs of environmental externalities resulting from fuel production 
and use, including reducing the impacts on human health from emissions of criteria air 
pollutants, and reducing future economic damages from potential changes in the global 
climate caused by greenhouse gas emissions.   
These social benefits are partly offset by the increase in fuel use that results from 
added vehicle use due to the fuel economy rebound effect, as well as by added costs from the 
increased congestion, crashes, and noise caused by increased vehicle use.  They would also be 
offset by any loss in the utility that new vehicles provide to their buyers (and subsequent 
owners) if manufacturers include reductions in vehicles’ performance, carrying capacity, or 
comfort as part of their strategies to comply with higher fuel economy requirements and GHG 
standards.  However, the agencies’ analyses supporting the proposed standards do not 
anticipate any such reductions in utility as being necessary, and the analysis seeks to include 
the costs to manufacturers of preserving vehicle capabilities.a  For instance, the costs of 
engine downsizing include the costs of turbocharging the engine to maintain its performance.  
The total economic benefits from requiring higher fuel economy and reducing GHGs are 
likely to be substantial, and EPA and NHTSA have developed detailed estimates of the 
economic benefits from adopting more stringent standards.  
This chapter discusses the common economic and other values used by both NHTSA 
and EPA in their rulemaking analyses.  These inputs incorporate a range of forecast 
information, economic estimates, and input parameters.  This chapter describes the sources 
that EPA and NHTSA have relied upon for this information, the rationale underlying each 
assumption, and the agencies’ estimates of specific parameter values.  These common values 
                                                 
a
 Two exceptions – hybrid vehicles that may have some limited towing capacity, and electric vehicles – are 
discussed elsewhere. 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-3 
 
are then used as inputs into each agency’s respective modeling and other analyses of the 
economic benefits and costs of the EPA and NHTSA programs.  While the underlying input 
values are common to both agencies, program differences, and differences in the way each 
agency assesses its program that result in differing benefits estimates.  This issue is discussed 
further in Section I.C of the preamble to the joint rulemaking. 
4.2 What assumptions do the agencies use in the impact analyses?   
4.2.1 The on-road fuel economy “gap” 
4.2.1.1 Definition and past use by EPA and NHTSA 
In aggregate, actual fuel economy levels achieved by vehicles in on-road driving fall 
significantly short of their levels measured in the laboratory-like test conditions and two-cycle 
tests used under the CAFE program to determine the fuel economy ratings for different 
models for purposes of compliance with the CAFE and CO2 standards.  The test procedure 
used to determine compliance is highly controlled, and does not reflect real-world driving in a 
variety of ways – real-world driving tends to be more aggressive than the Federal Test 
Procedure (FTP) and Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) test cycles used to establish 
compliance with the GHG and CAFE regulations.  Real world driving tends to include more 
stops and starts and more rapid acceleration/deceleration, and may include the use of 
technologies like air-conditioning that reduce fuel economy but that are not exercised on the 
test cycle.1  There are also a number of elements that affect real-world achieved fuel economy 
which are not measured on the two cycle GHG/CAFE compliance test, such as wind 
resistance, road roughness, grade, temperature, and fuel energy content.  The agencies’ 
analyses for this proposal recognize this gap, and account for it by adjusting the fuel economy 
performance downward from its rated value.  In December 2006, EPA adopted changes to its 
regulations on fuel economy labeling, which were intended to bring vehicles’ label fuel 
economy levels seen by consumers shopping for new vehicles closer to their actual on-road 
fuel economy levels.2   
Comparisons of on-road and CAFE fuel economy levels developed by EPA as part of 
its 2006 Final Rule implementing new fuel economy labeling requirements for new vehicles 
indicated that actual on-road fuel economy for light-duty vehicles average about 20 percent 
lower than compliance fuel economy ratings.3  While there is great heterogeneity among 
individual drivers, as discussed in the referenced material, the 20 percent figure appears to 
represent an accurate average for modeling a fleet.  For example, if the overall EPA fuel 
economy rating of a light truck is 20 MPG, the on-road fuel economy actually achieved by a 
typical driver of that vehicle is expected to be 16 mpg (20*.80).  In its analysis supporting the 
Final Rule establishing CAFE standards for MY 2011, NHTSA employed EPA’s revised 
estimate of this on-road fuel economy gap in its analysis of the fuel savings resulting from 
alternative fuel efficiency standards.   EPA and NHTSA likewise employed this fuel economy 
gap for estimating fuel savings in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking and in the Interim Joint 
Technical Assessment Report (TAR) analysis for MYs 2017-2025. 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

An analysis conducted by NHTSA confirmed that EPA’s estimate of a 20 percent gap 
between test and on-road fuel economy for the majority of vehicles is well-founded.  NHTSA 
used data on the number of passenger cars and light trucks of each model year that were in 
service (registered for use) during each calendar year from 2000 through 2006; average fuel 
economy for passenger cars and light trucks produced during each model year; and estimates 
of average miles driven per year by cars and light trucks of different ages during each 
calendar year over that period.  These data were combined to develop estimates of the usage-
weighted average fuel economy that the U.S. passenger car and light truck fleets would have 
achieved during each year from 2000 through 2006 under test conditions. 
Table 4-1 compares NHTSA’s estimates of fleet-wide average fuel economy under 
test conditions for 2000 through 2006 to the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) 
published estimates of on-road fuel economy achieved by passenger cars and light trucks 
during each of those years.  As it shows, FHWA’s estimates of fuel economy for passenger 
cars ranged from 21-23 percent lower than NHTSA’s estimates of its fleet-wide average value 
under test conditions over this period, and FHWA’s estimates of fuel economy for light trucks 
ranged from 16-18 percent lower than NHTSA’s estimates of its fleet-wide average value 
under test conditions.  Thus, these results appear to confirm that the 20 percent on-road fuel 
economy gap represents a reasonable estimate for use in evaluating the fuel savings likely to 
result from more stringent fuel economy and CO2 standards in MYs 2017-2025.

We are aware of two potential issues involved in these estimates.  One, the estimates 
of total annual car and truck VMT are developed by the states and submitted to FHWA.  Each 
state uses its own definition of a car and a truck.  For example, some states classify minivans 
as cars and some as trucks.  Thus, there are known inconsistencies with these estimates when 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-5 
 
evaluated separately for cars and trucks.  Also, total gasoline consumption can be reasonably 
estimated from excise tax receipts, but separate estimates for cars and trucks are not available.  
We are not aware of the precise methodology used to develop the distinct on-road fuel 
economy estimates for cars and trucks developed by FHWA.  We do not believe that they are 
based on direct measurements from substantial numbers of vehicles, as no such test programs 
were found by EPA during its fuel economy labeling rule in 2006.  Also, the year-to-year 
consistency for both car and truck fuel economy implies some methodology other than direct 
measurement.  For this reason, NHTSA and EPA are not using distinct on-road fuel economy 
gaps for cars and trucks, but one common value of 20 percent for both vehicle classes for 
purposes of estimating the fuel savings of the standards.  This figure lies between the separate 
estimated for cars and light trucks reported in Table 4-1. 
For purposes of the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, the TAR, and this current 
rulemaking for MYs 2017-2025, then, the agencies are assuming that the on-road fuel 
economy gap for liquid fuel is 20 percent.   As in the TAR, the agencies assume that the 
overall energy shortfall for the electric drivetrain (for vehicles that have those instead of or in 
addition to gasoline engines) is 30 percent when driven on wall electricity.  The 30 percent 
value was derived from the agencies’ engineering judgment based on several data points.  
Foremost among these, during the stakeholder meetings conducted prior to the Interim Joint 
TAR, confidential business information (CBI) was supplied by several manufacturers which 
indicated that electrically powered vehicles had greater variability in their on-road energy 
consumption than vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.  Second, data from 
EPA’s 2006 analysis of the “five cycle” fuel economy label as part of the rulemaking 
discussed above potentially supported a larger on-road shortfall for vehicles with hybrid-
electric drivetrains4  And third, heavy accessory load, extreme (both high and low) 
temperatures, and aggressive driving have deleterious impacts of unknown magnitudes on 
battery performance.  As a counterpoint, CBI provided by several other manufacturers 
suggested that the on-road/laboratory differential attributable to electric operation should 
approach that of liquid fuel operation in the future.  Consequently, 30 percent was judged by 
the agencies to be a reasonable estimate for the Interim Joint TAR, and was carried into the 
current analysis. 
The recent 2011 Fuel Economy labeling rule employs a 30% on-road shortfall for 
electric vehicles. 5  Under the labeling program, for gasoline vehicles, there are two methods 
for getting label values: full 5-cycle or derived 5-cycle.  Full 5-cycle means all five cycles are 
tested, and bag MPG results are used in a set of formulae to determine label MPG.  Derived 5-
cycle involves testing on the FTP and Highway tests and adjusting those values using 
regression-based formulae, to get label MPG values. The derived 5-cycle adjustment results in 
an ever-increasing adjustment in percentage terms.  However, the data on which the derived 
5-cycle formulae are based ends at roughly 70 MPG, where the adjustment is about 70% or an 
on-road gap of 30% (assuming that the five cycle formula represents the real world).  For 
labeling purposes, lacking any EVs or PHEVs (or any vehicles beyond 70 MPG) in the 
database at the time this adjustment was derived, the adjustment was set at 70% for MPG 
values beyond 70 MPG.   
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-6 
 
Electric vehicles are allowed and expected to use the derived 5-cycle method, which 
suggests that their on-road gap will be approximately 30% during the near future.  Individual 
EVs may vary, and as additional data becomes available the agencies will consider whether 
the 30% average gap remains appropriate.   
4.2.1.2 Considerations in Future Years 
Looking forward to MYs 2017-2025, while the agencies do not forecast changes in 
most of the factors discussed above that contribute to the on-road gap in ways that would 
change our estimates, the agencies expect that two specific factors will change somewhat that 
could affect this analysis.  Specifically, we anticipate changes in the energy content of fuels 
sold at retail as a result of the recent EPA Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2) rulemaking and 
E15 waiver decision,6 as well as a change in reference air conditioning efficiency as a result 
of the recent MYs 2012-2016 EPA Light Duty Greenhouse Gas rulemaking. 
4.2.1.2.1 Air Conditioning 
Air conditioning is a significant contributor to the on-road efficiency gap.  While the 
air conditioner is turned off during the FTP and HFET tests, in real world use drivers often 
use air conditioning in warm, humid conditions.  The air conditioning compressor can also be 
engaged during “defrost” operation of the heating system.7  In the MYs 2012-2016 
rulemaking, the agencies estimated the average impact of an air conditioning system at 
approximately 14.3 grams over an SCO3 test for an average vehicle without any of the 
improved air conditioning technologies discussed in that rulemaking.  For a 27 MPG (330 g 
CO2/mile) vehicle, this is approximately 20 percent of the total estimated on-road gap, or 
about 4 percent of total fuel consumption. 
In the MYs 2012-2016 rule, EPA estimated that 85 percent of MY 2016 vehicles 
would reduce their air conditioning-related CO2 emissions by 40 percent through the use of 
advanced air conditioning efficiency technologies.  Incorporating this change would reduce 
the average on-road gap by about 2 percent in the reference case.b  However, as shown in 
Chapter 5 of the joint TSD air conditioning-related fuel consumption does not proportionally 
decrease as overall engine efficiency improves. Unlike most technologies in this rulemaking, 
which have a multiplicative reduction on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, the load due 
to air conditioning operation is relatively constant across engine efficiency and technology.  
As a consequence, as engine efficiency increases, air conditioning operation represents an 
increasing percentage of vehicular fuel consumption.c  To some extent, these factors are 
expected to counterbalance, so the agencies therefore chose not to make an air conditioning-
related adjustment to the on-road gap for this proposal.  
                                                 
b
 4% of the on-road gap x 40% reduction in air conditioning fuel consumption x 85% of the fleet = ~2%. 
c
 As an example, the air conditioning load of 14.3 g/mile of CO2 is a smaller percentage (4.3%) of 330 g/mile 
than of 260 g/mile  (5.4%). 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

4.2.1.2.2 Fuel Energy Content 
Differences in fuel energy content between test conditions and real-world driving is 
another contributor to the on-road fuel economy gap.  Two-cycle testing for CAFE and CO2 
compliance is based on “certification fuel” which contains no ethanol (also known as E0). The 
on-road fuel economy gap is estimated with reference to the difference in fuel energy content 
between certification fuel and 2004 retail gallons,d but this rule produces a reduction in 
petroleum based fuel  consumption only.e   Volumes of renewable fuels are statutorily fixed 
by the Renewable Fuel Standard, so the entirety of the energy savings will take place as 
reduced oil consumption.   To estimate the petroleum fuel savings, we modify the on-road gap 
by the average difference in energy content between CY 2004 retail fuel used in the five cycle 
analysis and certification fuel.  This results in an approximately 1% higher fuel economy than 
if no additional adjustment was made for fuel energy content, and corresponds to the greater 
energy content of certification gasoline as compared to 2004 retail gasoline.

E0 BTU/Gallon = 115,000 
2004 BTU/Gallon  = 113,912 (3.14% ethanol, 96.86% petroleum gasoline) 
A related adjustment in fuel energy was made in order to “match” fuel savings to the 
fuel prices used in this analysis.  As discussed below, the agencies use fuel prices from the 
Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2011 reference 
case, which assume approximately 20 percent of the fuel pool by volume is ethanol.f  By 
contrast, and as shown above, the gasoline savings from this rule are calculated as gallons of 
certification fuel, which is is more energy dense than ethanol blended market fuel.  To 
appropriately apply the AEO prices on a dollar per btu basis, we adjust our certification fuel 
savings upwards by approximately 5% (the difference between the energy content of E15 
retail fuel and certification) when monetizing the fuel savings.  This adjustment more 
appropriately reflects AEO projections of motor gasoline energy prices.  
                                                 
d
 The five cycle formula analysis is based on CY 2004 data. 
e
 Ethanol contains approximately 76,000 British Thermal Units (Btu) per gallon as compared to petroleum 
gasoline (Indolene), which contains approximately 115,000 Btu.  Thus, a 10 percent ethanol (E10) blend 
contains approximately 3.3 percent less energy than a gallon of E0, and an E15 blend contains approximately 5.1 
percent less energy than a gallon of E0.       
f
 EIA projects that ethanol replaces approximately 12 percent of the gasoline energy demand by 2035.  This is 
greater than 20 percent of the gasoline pool by volume.   For calculation of fuel savings for MYs 2017-2025, for 
this rulemaking, the agencies made the simplifying assumption that all retail gallons were E15.

4.2.2 Fuel prices and the value of saving fuel 
 
Projected future fuel prices are a critical input into the preliminary economic analysis 
of alternative fuel efficiency and GHG standards, because they determine the value of fuel 
savings both to new vehicle buyers and to society.  For this proposal, EPA and NHTSA relied 
on the most recent fuel price projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 
(EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) for this analysis, the AEO 2011 Reference Case.  The 
Reference Case forecasts inflation-adjusted (constant-dollar) retail gasoline and diesel fuel 
prices and represents the EIA’s most up-to-date estimate of future prices for petroleum 
products.  In the Preface to AEO 2011, the Energy Information Administration describes the 
reference case.  They state that, “Projections by EIA are not statements of what will happen 
but of what might happen, given the assumptions and methodologies used for any particular 
scenario. The Reference case projection is a business-as-usual trend estimate, given known 
technology and technological and demographic trends.  The agency has published annual 
forecasts of energy prices and consumption levels for the U.S. economy since 1982 in its 
AEOs.  These forecasts have been widely relied upon by federal agencies for use in regulatory 
analysis and for other purposes.  Since 1994, EIA’s annual forecasts have been based upon the 
agency’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), which includes detailed representation 
of supply pathways, sources of demand, and their interaction to determine prices for different 
forms of energy. 
As compared to the gasoline prices used in the MYs 2012-2016 analysis, which relied 
on forecasts from AEO 2010, the AEO 2011 Reference Case fuel prices are largely similar.  
They are slightly higher through the year 2020, but slightly lower for most years after 2020 
(when both are expressed in 2009 dollars).  A comparison is presented below, Table 4-2.   
Table 4-2 Gasoline Prices for Selected Years in AEO 2010 and 2011  
(Presented in constant 2009$ and including all taxes) 
 2015 2020 2030 
AEO 2011 $3.13 $3.38 $3.64 
AEO 2010 $3.10 $3.37 $3.71 
 
The retail fuel price forecasts presented in AEO 2011 span the period from 2008 
through 2035.  Measured in constant 2009 dollars, the AEO 2011 Reference Case forecast of 
retail gasoline prices during calendar year 2017 is $3.25 per gallon, rising gradually to $3.71 
by the year 2035 (these values include federal and state taxes).  However, valuing fuel savings 
over the full lifetimes of passenger cars and light trucks affected by the standards proposed for 
MYs 2017-25 requires fuel price forecasts that extend through 2060, approximately the last 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

year during which a significant number of MY 2025 vehicles will remain in service.g  To 
obtain fuel price forecasts for the years 2036 through 2060, the agency assumes that retail fuel 
prices will continue to increase after 2035 at the average annual rate (0.7%) projected for 
2017-2035 in the AEO 2011 Reference Case.  The years between 2008 and 2016 were not 
included in the extrapolation due to the high volatility in the AEO projection for those years.  
This assumption results in a projected retail price of gasoline that reaches $4.16 in 2050.   
The value of fuel savings resulting from improved fuel economy and reduced GHG 
emissions to buyers of light-duty vehicles is determined by the retail price of fuel, which 
includes federal, state, and any local taxes imposed on fuel sales.  Total taxes on gasoline, 
including federal, state, and local levies, averaged $0.43 per gallon during 2008, while those 
levied on diesel averaged $0.46.  Because fuel taxes represent transfers of resources from fuel 
buyers to government agencies, rather than real resources that are consumed in the process of 
supplying or using fuel, their value must be deducted from retail fuel prices to determine the 
value of fuel savings resulting from more stringent fuel efficiency and GHG standards to the 
U.S. economy.8  When calculating the value of fuel saved by an individual driver, however, 
these taxes are included as part of the value of realized fuel savings.  Over the entire period 
spanned by the agencies’ analysis, this difference causes each gallon of fuel saved to be 
valued by about $0.36 (in constant 2009 dollars) more from the perspective of an individual 
vehicle buyer than from the overall perspective of the U.S. economy.h    
In the estimates of costs and benefits presented in the preamble and in the agencies’ 
RIAs, the agencies have included the full fuel savings over vehicles’ expected lifetimes, 
discounted to their present values using both 3 and 7 percent discount rates.  Additional 
discussion of this approach can be found in preamble Sections III.H and IV. 
4.2.3 Vehicle Lifetimes and Survival Rates 
The agencies’ analysis of fuel savings and related benefits from adopting more 
stringent fuel economy and GHG standards for MYs 2017-2025 passenger cars and light 
trucks begin by estimating the resulting changes in fuel use over the entire lifetimes of 
affected cars and light trucks.  The change in total fuel consumption by vehicles produced 
during each of these model years is calculated as the difference in their total lifetime fuel use 
over the entire lifetimes of these vehicles as compared to a reference case.   
The first step in estimating lifetime fuel consumption by vehicles produced during a 
model year is to calculate the number of those vehicles expected to remain in service during 
                                                 
g
 The agency defines the maximum lifetime of vehicles as the highest age at which more than 2 percent of those 
originally produced during a model year remain in service.  In the case of light trucks, for example, this age has 
typically been 36 years for recent model years. 
h
 For society, the fuel taxes represent a transfer payment.  By contrast, an individual realizes savings from not 
paying the additional money. 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

each future calendar year after they are produced and sold.i  This number is calculated by 
multiplying the number of vehicles originally produced during a model year by the proportion 
expected to remain in service at the age they will have reached during each subsequent 
calendar year, often referred to as a “survival rate.”   
The proportions of passenger cars and light trucks expected to remain in service at 
each age are drawn from a 2006 NHTSA study, and are shown in Table 4-3 9   Note that these 
survival rates were calculated against the pre-MY 2011 definitions of cars and light trucks, 
because the NHTSA study has not been updated since 2006.  Because the agencies are 
unaware of a better data source, these values were used unchanged, and are the same values 
used in the MYs 2012-2016 rule and the interim Joint TAR. The rates are applied to vehicles 
based on their regulatory class (passenger car or light truck) regardless of fuel type or level of 
technology. Survival may vary by other factors, but data to support an investigation do not 
currently exist. Additionally, the survival rates are assumed to remain constant over time.  
The survival and annual mileage estimates reported in this section’s tables reflect the 
convention that vehicles are defined to be of age 1 during the calendar year that coincides 
with their model year.   Thus for example, model year 2017 vehicles will be considered to be 
of age 1 during calendar year 2017.  This convention is used in order to account for the fact 
that vehicles produced during a model year typically are first offered for sale in June through 
September of the preceding calendar year (for example, sales of a model year typically begin 
in June through September of the previous calendar year, depending on manufacturer).  Thus, 
virtually all of the vehicles produced during a model year will be in use for some or all of the 
calendar year coinciding with their model year, and they are considered to be of age 1 during 
that year.j  
                                                 
i
 Vehicles are defined to be of age 1 during the calendar year corresponding to the model year in which they are 
produced; thus for example, model year 2000 vehicles are considered to be of age 1 during calendar year 2000, 
age 1 during calendar year 2001, and to reach their maximum age of 26 years during calendar year 2025.  
NHTSA considers the maximum lifetime of vehicles to be the age after which less than 2 percent of the vehicles 
originally produced during a model year remain in service.  Applying these conventions to vehicle registration 
data indicates that passenger cars have a maximum age of 26 years, while light trucks have a maximum lifetime 
of 36 years.  SeeLu, S., NHTSA, Regulatory Analysis and Evaluation Division, “Vehicle Survivability and 
Travel Mileage Schedules,” DOT HS 809 952, 8-11 (January 2006).  Available at http://www-
nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/809952.pdf (last accessed Sept. 9, 2011). 
j
 A slight increase in the fraction of new passenger cars remaining in service beyond age 10 has accounted for a 
small share of growth in the U.S. automobile fleet.  The fraction of new automobiles remaining in service to 
various ages was computed from R.L. Polk vehicle registration data for 1977 through 2005 by the DOT’s Center 
for Statistical Analysis.

4.2.4 VMT 
The second step in estimating lifetime fuel use by the cars or light trucks produced 
during a future model year is to calculate the total number of miles that they will be driven 
during each year of their expected lifetimes.  To estimate total miles driven, the number of 
cars and light trucks projected to remain in use during each future calendar year is multiplied 
by the average number of miles a surviving car or light truck is expected to be driven at the 
age it will have reached in that year.  Estimates of average annual miles driven by Calendar 
Year 2001 cars and light trucks of various ages were developed by NHTSA from the Federal 
Highway Administration’s 2001 National Household Travel Survey, and are reported in Table 
4-4.  These estimates represent the typical number of miles driven by a surviving light duty 
vehicle at each age over its estimated full lifetime.  To determine the number of miles a 
typical vehicle produced during a given model year is expected to be driven at a specific age, 
the average annual mileage for a vehicle of that model year and age is multiplied by the 
corresponding survival rate for vehicles of that age.

4.2.4.1 Adjusting vehicle use for future fuel prices 
The estimates of average annual miles driven by passenger cars and light trucks 
reported in Table 4-4 reflect the historically low gasoline prices that prevailed at the time the 
2001 NHTS was conducted.  Under the assumption that people tend to drive more as the cost 
of driving decreases, the higher fuel prices that are forecast for future years would be 
expected to reduce average vehicle use.    For this rulemaking, the agencies updated the 
estimates of average vehicle use reported in Table 4-4 using the forecasts of future fuel prices 
reported in the AEO 2011 Reference Case. This adjustment accounts for the difference 
between the average retail price per gallon of fuel forecast during each calendar year over the 
expected lifetimes of model year 2017-25 passenger cars and light trucks, and the average 
price that prevailed when the NHTS was conducted in 2001.   
Specifically, the elasticity of annual vehicle use with respect to fuel cost per mile 
corresponding to the 10 percent fuel economy rebound effect used in this analysis (i.e., an 
elasticity of annual vehicle use with respect to fuel cost per mile driven of -0.10; see Section 
4.2.5) was applied to the percentage change in cost-per-mile travel between each future year’s 
vehicle and  the cost per mile of a vehicle that was the same age in 2001. This computation 
adjusts the estimates of annual mileage by vehicle age derived from the 2001 NHTS to reflect 
the effect of higher fuel prices and changes in the fuel economies of new model year vehicles 
over time for each future calendar year of the expected lifetimes of model year 2017-25 cars 
and light trucks.  
4.2.4.2 Ensuring consistency with growth in total vehicle use 
The estimates of annual miles driven by passenger cars and light trucks at each age 
were also adjusted to reflect projected future growth in average use for vehicles of all ages.  
Increases in the average number of miles cars and trucks are driven each year have been an 
important source of historical growth in total car and light truck use, and are expected to be a 
continued source of future growth in total light-duty vehicle travel as well.  As an illustration 
of the importance of growth in average vehicle use, the total number of miles driven by 
passenger cars increased 35 percent from 1985 through 2005, equivalent to a compound 
annual growth rate of 1.5 percent.10  During that same time, however, the total number of 
passenger cars registered for in the U.S. grew by only about 0.3 percent annually.k Thus 
                                                 
k
 A slight increase in the fraction of new passenger cars remaining in service beyond age 10 has accounted for a 
small share of growth in the U.S. automobile fleet. The fraction of new automobiles remaining in service to 
various ages was computed from R.L. Polk vehicle registration data for 1977 through 2005 by the agency’s 
Center for Statistical Analysis. 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

growth in the average number of miles automobiles are driven each year accounted for the 
remaining 1.2 percent (= 1.5 percent - 0.3 percent) annual growth in total automobile use.l   
Further, the AEO 2011 Reference Case forecasts of total car and light truck use and of 
the number of cars and light trucks in use suggest that their average annual use will continue 
to increase gradually from 2010 through 2035, as detailed in the following sections.m 
 In order to develop reasonable estimates of future growth in the average number of 
miles driven by cars and light trucks of all ages, the agencies calculated the rate of growth in 
the mileage schedules necessary for total car and light truck travel to increase at the rate 
forecast in the AEO 2011 Reference Case.  The growth rate in average annual car and light 
truck use produced by this calculation is approximately 1 percent per year through 2030, and 
0.5% per year from 2031-2050.n  This  growth was applied to the mileage figures reported in 
Table 4-4 (after adjusting them as described previously for future fuel prices and expected 
vehicle survival rates) to estimate average annual mileage during each calendar year analyzed 
and during the expected lifetimes of model year 2017-25 cars and light truckso 
The agencies made separate adjustments to vehicle use to account for projected 
increases in future fuel prices and for continued growth in average vehicle use during each 
future calendar year.  Because the effects of both fuel prices and cumulative growth in 
average vehicle use differ for each year, these adjustments result in different VMT schedules 
for each future year.  While the adjustment for future fuel prices generally reduces average 
mileage at each age from the values tabulated from the 2001 NHTS, the adjustment for  
reduced fuel consumption and the expected future growth in average vehicle use increases it.  
The net impact resulting from these two separate adjustments is continued growth over time 
in the average number of miles that vehicles of each age are driven, although at slower rates 
than those observed from 1985 – 2005. Observed aggregate VMT in recent years has actually 
declined, but it is unclear if the underlying cause is general shift in behavior or a response to a 
set of temporary economic conditions. The agencies’ intend to consider new data on the VMT 
growth estimates as it becomes available, and the agencies request comment on this topic.

 The agencies note that VMT growth has slowed, and because the impact of VMT is an important element in 
our benefit estimates, we will continue to monitor this trend to see whether this is a reversal in trend or 
temporary slow down. See the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (http://nhts.ornl.gov/2009/pub/stt.pdf)

 It was not possible to estimate separate growth rates in average annual use for cars and light trucks, because of 
the significant reclassification of light truck models as passenger cars discussed previously.  For the final 
rulemaking, the agencies intend to review the relevant historic data and current AEO forecast and update these 
values if necessary.

 As indicated previously, a vehicle’s age during any future calendar year is uniquely determined by the 
difference between that calendar year and the model year when it was produced.

The NHTSA and EPA models project slightly different fuel costs per mile for vehicles

agencies’ programs and the different technologies projected by each agency’s model to be 
used by vehicle manufacturers to comply with each program.  Over the entire lifetimes of 
those vehicles, however, the agencies’ estimates of the number of miles they are expected to 
be driven differ by about 3% for cars and 1% for light trucks.p For comparison, Table 4-5

 While the agencies’ projections of VMT are highly similar both on average (~2-3% different depending on the

4.2.5 Accounting for the fuel economy rebound effect 
The rebound effect refers to the increase in vehicle use that results if an increase in 
fuel efficiency lowers the cost per mile of driving, which can encourage people to drive 
slightly more.  Because this additional driving consumes some fuel and increases emissions, it 
reduces fuel savings and increases emissions compared to those otherwise expected from the 
proposed standards.  Thus the magnitude of the rebound effect is one of the determinants of 
the actual fuel savings and emission reductions that are likely to result from adopting stricter 
fuel economy or emissions standards, and is thus an important parameter affecting EPA’s and 
NHTSA’s evaluation of the proposed and alternative standards for future model years.   
The rebound effect is measured directly by estimating the change in vehicle use, often 
expressed in terms of vehicle miles traveled (VMT), with respect to changes in vehicle fuel 
efficiency.r  However, it is a common practice in the literature to measure the rebound effect 
by estimating the change in vehicle use with respect to the fuel cost per mile driven, which 
depends on both vehicle fuel efficiency and fuel prices.s  When expressed as a positive 
percentage, these two parameters give the ratio of the percentage increase in vehicle use that 
results from a percentage increase in fuel efficiency or reduction in fuel cost per mile, 
respectively.  For example, a 10 percent rebound effect means that a 10 percent decrease in 
fuel cost per mile is expected to result in a 1 percent increase in VMT.  
The fuel economy rebound effect for light-duty vehicles has been the subject of a large 
number of studies since the early 1980s.  Although these studies have reported a wide range 
of estimates of its exact magnitude, they generally conclude that a significant rebound effect 
occurs when the cost per mile of driving decreases.t  The most common approach to 
estimating its magnitude has been to analyze household survey data on vehicle use, fuel 
consumption, fuel prices (often obtained from external sources), and other variables that 
influence travel demand . Other studies have relied on  annual aggregate U.S. data.  Finally, 
more recent studies have used annual data from individual states.u   
                                                 
r
 Vehicle fuel efficiency is more often measured in terms of fuel consumption (gallons per mile) rather than fuel 
economy (miles per gallon) in rebound estimates. 
s
 Fuel cost per mile is equal to the price of fuel in dollars per gallon divided by fuel economy in miles per gallon 
(or multiplied by fuel consumption in gallons per mile), so this figure declines when a vehicle’s fuel efficiency 
increases. 
t
 Some studies estimate that the long-run rebound effect is significantly larger than the immediate response to 
increased fuel efficiency.  Although their estimates of the adjustment period required for the rebound effect to 
reach its long-run magnitude vary, this long-run effect could be more appropriate for evaluating the fuel savings 
and emissions reductions resulting from stricter standards that would apply throughout the lifetime of future 
model year vehicles.  
u
 In effect, these studies treat U.S. states as a data “panel” by applying appropriate estimation procedures to data 
consisting of each year’s average values of these variables for the separate states.

This section surveys these previous studies, summarizes recent work on the rebound 
effect,12 and explains the basis for the 10 percent rebound effect EPA and NHTSA are using 
in this proposed rulemaking. 
4.2.5.1 Summary of historical literature on rebound effect 
It is important to note that a majority of the studies previously conducted on the 
rebound effect rely on data from the 1950-1990s.  While these older studies provide valuable 
information on the potential magnitude of the rebound effect, studies that include more recent 
information (e.g., data within the last decade) may provide more reliable estimates of how this 
proposal will affect future driving behavior.  Therefore, the more recent studies have been 
described in more detail in Section 4.2.5.2 below.  
Estimates based on aggregate U.S. vehicle travel data published by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, covering the period from 
roughly 1950 to 1990, have found long-run rebound effects on the order of 10-30 percent.  
Some of these studies are summarized in the following table.

While studies using national (Table 4-6) and state level (Table 4-7) data have found 
relatively consistent long-run estimates of the rebound effect, household surveys display more 
variability (Table 4-8).  There are several possible explanations for this larger variability.  
One explanation is that some of these studies do not include vehicle age as an explanatory 
variable, thus leading to omitted variable bias in some of their estimates.13  Another 
explanation is that these studies consistently find that the magnitude of the rebound effect 
differs according to the number of vehicles a household owns, and the average number of 
vehicles owned per household differs among the surveys used to derive these estimates.  Still 
another possibility is that it is difficult to distinguish the impact of residential density on 
vehicle use from that of fuel prices, since households with higher fuel prices are more likely 
to reside in urban areas.14

It is important to note that some of these studies actually quantify the price elasticity 
of gasoline demand (e.g., Puller & Greening15) or the elasticity of VMT with respect to the 
price of gasoline (e.g., Pickrell & Schimek), rather than the elasticity of VMT with respect to 
the fuel cost per mile of driving.  The latter of these measures more closely matches the 
definition of the fuel economy rebound effect.  In fact, none of the studies cited above 
estimate the direct measure of the rebound effect (i.e., the increase in VMT attributed to an 
increase in fuel efficiency).  This topic is discussed in more detail in Section 4.2.5.2.     
Another important distinction among studies of the rebound effect is whether they 
assume that the effect is constant, or varies over time in response to the absolute levels of fuel 
costs, personal income, or household vehicle ownership.  Most studies using aggregate annual 
data for the U.S. assume a constant rebound effect, although some of these studies test 
whether the effect can vary as changes in retail fuel prices or average fuel efficiency alter fuel 
cost per mile driven.  Many studies using household survey data estimate significantly 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-22 
 
different rebound effects for households owning varying numbers of vehicles, with most 
finding that the rebound effect is larger among households that own more vehicles. v,w  
Finally, one recent study using state-level data concludes that the rebound effect varies 
directly in response to changes in personal income and the degree of urbanization of U.S. 
cities, as well as fuel costs.   
In order to provide a more comprehensive overview of previous estimates of the 
rebound effect, EPA and NHTSA reviewed 22 studies of the rebound effect conducted from 
1983 through 2005.  The agencies then performed a detailed analysis of the 66 separate 
estimates of the long-run rebound effect reported in these studies, which is summarized in 
Table 4-9 below.x  As the table indicates, these 66 estimates of the long-run rebound effect 
range from as low as 7 percent to as high as 75 percent, with a mean value of 23 percent.  
Limiting the sample to 50 estimates reported in the 17 published studies of the rebound effect 
yields the same range, but a slightly higher mean estimate (24 percent).   
The type of data used and authors’ assumption about whether the rebound effect varies 
over time have important effects on its estimated magnitude.  The 34 estimates derived from 
analysis of U.S. annual time-series data produce a mean estimate of 18 percent for the long-
run rebound effect, while the mean of 23 estimates based on household survey data is 
considerably larger (31 percent), and the mean of 9 estimates based on state data (25 percent) 
is close to that for the entire sample.  The 37 estimates assuming a constant rebound effect 
produce a mean of 23 percent, identical to the mean of the 29 estimates reported in studies 
that allowed the rebound effect to vary in response to fuel prices, vehicle ownership, or 
household income.

v
 Six of the household survey studies evaluated in Table 4-7 found that the rebound effects varies in relation to 
the number of household vehicles.  Of those six studies, four found that the rebound effect rises with higher 
vehicle ownership, and two found that it declines. 
w
 The four studies with rebound estimates that increase with higher household vehicle ownership: Greene & Hu; 
Hensher et al.; Wall et al.; and West & Pickrell.  The two studies with rebound estimates that decrease with 
higher household vehicle ownership: Mannering and Winston; and Greene et al. (note that Greene et al. showed 
decreases in the rebound effect as households went from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3 vehicles, then a slight increase 
from 3 to 4 vehicles; the rebound estimate for households with 4 vehicles was lower than for households with 2 
vehicles). 
x In some cases, NHTSA derived estimates of the overall rebound effect from more detailed results reported in 
the studies.   For example, where studies estimated different rebound effects for households owning different 
numbers of vehicles but did not report an overall value, the agency computed a weighted average of the reported 
values using the distribution of households among vehicle ownership categories.

4.2.5.2 Summary of recent studies and analyses of the rebound effect 
More recent studies since 2007 indicate that the rebound effect has decreased over 
time as incomes have generally increased and, until recently, fuel costs as a share of total 
monetary travel costs have generally decreased.y  One theoretical argument for why the 
rebound effect should vary over time is that the responsiveness to the fuel cost of driving will 
be larger when it is a larger proportion of the total cost of driving.  For example, as incomes 
rise, the responsiveness to the fuel cost per mile of driving will decrease if people view the 
time cost of driving – which is likely to be related to their income levels – as a larger 
component of the total cost.   
Small and Van Dender combined time series data for each of the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia to estimate the rebound effect, allowing the magnitude of the rebound to 
vary over time.16  For the time period from 1966-2001, their study found a long-run rebound 
effect of 22.2 percent, which is consistent with previously published studies.  But for the most 
recent five year period (1997-2001), the long-run rebound effect decreased to 10.7 percent.  
Furthermore, when the authors updated their estimates with data through 2004, the long-run 
rebound effect for the most recent five year period (2000-2004) dropped to 6 percent.17   
Finally, when the Small methodology was used to project the future rebound effect, estimates 
of the rebound effect throughout 2010-2030 were below 6 percent given a range of future 
gasoline price and income projections.18   
                                                 
y While real gasoline prices have varied over time, fuel costs (which reflect both fuel prices and fuel efficiency) 
as a share of total vehicle operating costs declined substantially from the mid-1970s until the mid-2000s when 
the share increased modestly (see Greene (2010)).  Note that two studies discussed in this section, Small and Van 
Dender (2007) and Hymel, Small, and Van Dender (2010), find that the rebound effect is more strongly 
dependant on income than fuel costs.  A third study, Greene (2010), did not directly test the effect of fuel cost on 
rebound, but found evidence supporting the strong effect from income.  Although several studies have shown 
that the rebound effect rises with household vehicle ownership (see section 4.2.5.1), which has generally 
increased with income, these findings indicate that income has had a negative effect on rebound.

In 2010, Hymel, Small and Van Dender extended the Small and Van Dender model by 
adding congestion as an endogenous variable.19  Although controlling for congestion 
significantly increased their estimates of the rebound effect, Hymel, Small and Van Dender 
also found that the rebound effect was declining over time.  For the time period from 1966-
2004, they estimated a long-run rebound effect of 24 percent, while for 2004 they estimated a 
long-run rebound effect of 13 percent.     
Research conducted by David Greene in 2008-2009 under contract with EPA further 
appears to support the theory that the magnitude of the rebound effect is declining over time 
and may be as low as zero.20  Over the entire time period analyzed (1966-2007), Greene found 
that fuel prices had a statistically significant impact on VMT, while fuel efficiency did not, 
which is similar to Small and Van Dender’s prior finding.  When Small and Van Dender 
tested whether the elasticity of vehicle travel with respect to the price of fuel was equal to the 
elasticity with respect to the rate of fuel consumption (gallons per mile), they found that the 
data could not reject this hypothesis.  Therefore, Small and Van Dender estimated the rebound 
effect as the elasticity of travel with respect to fuel cost per mile.  In contrast, Greene’s 
research showed that the hypothesis of equal elasticities for gasoline prices and fuel efficiency 
can be rejected.  In spite of this result, Greene also tested Small and Van Dender’s 
formulation which allows the elasticity of fuel cost per mile to decrease with increasing per 
capita income.  The results of estimation using national time series data confirmed the results 
obtained by Small and Van Dender using a time series of state level data.  When using 
Greene’s preferred functional form, the projected rebound effect is approximately 12 percent 
in 2007, and drops to 10 percent in 2010, 9 percent in 2016 and 8 percent in 2030.  
Since there has been little variation in fuel efficiency in the data over time, isolating 
the impact of fuel efficiency on VMT can be difficult using econometric analysis of historical 
data.  Therefore, studies that estimate the rebound effect using time-series data often examine 
the impact of gasoline prices on VMT, or the combined impact of both gasoline prices and 
fuel efficiency on VMT, as discussed above.  However, these studies may overstate the 
potential impact of the rebound effect resulting from this proposal, if people are more 
responsive to changes in gasoline prices than to changes in fuel efficiency itself.  Recent work 
conducted by Kenneth Gillingham included an estimate of the elasticity of VMT with respect 
to the price of gasoline of -0.17, while his corresponding estimate of the elasticity of VMT 
with respect to fuel economy was only 0.05.21  While this research pertains specifically to 
California, this finding suggests that the common assumption that consumers respond 
similarly to changes in gasoline prices and changes in fuel efficiency may overstate the 
magnitude of the rebound effect.  Additional research is needed in this area, and the agencies 
request comments and data on this topic.   
Another question discussed by Gillingham is whether consumers actually respond the 
same way to an increase in the cost of driving compared to a decrease in the cost of driving.  
There is some evidence in the literature that consumers are more responsive to an increase in 
prices than to a decrease in prices.  At the aggregate level, Dargay & Gately and Sentenac-
Chemin have shown that demand for transportation fuel is asymmetric.22,23  In other words, 
given the same size change in prices, the response to a decrease in gasoline price is smaller 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

than the response to an increase in gasoline price.  Gately has shown that the response to an 
increase in oil prices can be on the order of five times larger than the response to a price 
decrease.24  Furthermore, Dargay & Gately and Sentenac-Chemin find evidence that 
consumers respond more to a large shock than a small, gradual change in fuel prices.  Since 
these proposed standards would decrease the cost of driving gradually over time, it is possible 
that the rebound effect would be much smaller than some of the historical estimates included 
in the literature.  Although these types of asymmetric responses have been noted at the 
aggregate level on oil and gasoline consumption, little research has been done on these same 
phenomena in the context of changes in vehicle fuel efficiency and the resulting rebound 
effect.  More research in this area is also important, and the agencies invite comment on this 
aspect of the rebound effect.   
4.2.5.3 NHTSA analysis of the rebound effect 
To provide additional insight into the rebound effect for the purposes of this 
rulemaking, NHTSA developed several new estimates of its magnitude.  These estimates were 
developed by estimating and testing several econometric models of the relationship between 
vehicle miles-traveled and factors that influence it, including household income, fuel prices, 
vehicle fuel efficiency, road supply, the number of vehicles in use, vehicle prices, and other 
factors.  
As the 2007 study by Small and Van Dender pointed out, it is important to account for 
the effect of fuel prices when attempting to estimate the rebound effect.  Failing to control for 
changes in fuel prices is likely to bias estimates of the rebound effect.  Therefore, changes in 
fuel prices are taken into account in NHTSA’s analysis of the rebound effect. Several 
different approaches were used to estimate the fuel economy rebound effect for light duty 
vehicles, many of which attempt to account for the endogenous relationship of fuel efficiency 
to fuel prices.   
The results from each of these approaches are presented in Table 4-10 below.  The 
table reports the value of the rebound effect calculated over the entire period from 1950 
through 2006, as well as for the final year of that period.  In addition, the table presents 
forecasts of the average rebound effect between 2010 and 2030, which utilize forecasts of 
personal income, fuel prices, and fuel efficiency from EIA’s AEO 2011 Reference Case.   
The results of NHTSA’s analysis are broadly consistent with the findings from 
previous research summarized above.  The historical average long-run rebound effect is 
estimated to range from 16-30 percent, and comparing these estimates to its calculated values 
for 2006 (which range from 8-14 percent) gives some an indication that it is declining in 
magnitude.  The forecast values of the rebound effect shown in the table also suggest that this 
decline is likely to continue through 2030, as they range from 4-16 percent.

4.2.5.4 Basis for rebound effect used by EPA and NHTSA in this rule 
As the preceding discussion indicates, there is a wide range of estimates for both the 
historical magnitude of the rebound effect and its projected future value, and there is some 
evidence that the magnitude of the rebound effect appears to be declining over time.  
Nevertheless, NHTSA requires a single point estimate for the rebound effect as an input to its 
analysis, although a range of estimates can be used to test the sensitivity to uncertainty about 
its exact magnitude.  Based on a combination of historical estimates of the rebound effect and 
more recent analyses conducted by EPA and NHTSA, an estimate of 10 percent for the 
rebound effect was used for this proposal (i.e., we assume a 10 percent decrease in fuel cost 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-27 
 
per mile from our proposed standards would result in a 1 percent increase in VMT), with a 
range of 5-15 percent for use in NHTSA’s sensitivity testing.   
As Table 4-6, Table 4-7, Table 4-9, and Table 4-9 indicate, the 10 percent figure is on 
the low end of the range reported in previous research, and Table 4-10 shows that it is also 
below most estimates of the historical and current magnitude of the rebound effect developed 
by NHTSA.  However, other recent research – particularly that conducted by Hymel, Small 
and Van Dender, Small and Van Dender, and Greene – reports persuasive evidence that the 
magnitude of the rebound effect is likely to be declining over time, and the forecasts 
developed by NHTSA and reported in Table 4-10 also suggest that this is likely to be the case.  
Furthermore, for the reasons described in section 4.2.5.2, historical estimates of the rebound 
effect may overstate the magnitude of a change in a small, gradual decrease in the cost of 
driving due to our proposed standards.  Finally, new research by Gillingham suggests that 
consumers may be more responsive to changes in gasoline prices than to changes in fuel 
efficiency, and that the rebound effect that occurs when consumers purchase more efficient 
vehicles as a result of a policy may be on the order of 6 percent.   
As a consequence, the agencies concluded that a value on the low end of the historical 
estimates reported in Table 4-6, Table 4-7, Table 4-8, and Table 4-9 is likely to provide a 
more reliable estimate of its magnitude during the future period spanned by the agencies’ 
analyses of the impacts of this proposal.  The 10 percent estimate lies within the 10-30 percent 
range of estimates for the historical rebound effect reported in most previous research, and at 
the upper end of the 5-10 percent range of estimates for the future rebound effect reported in 
the recent studies by Small and Greene.  As Table 4-10 shows, it also lies within the 3-16 
percent range of forecasts of the future magnitude of the rebound effect developed by NHTSA 
in its recent research.  In summary, the 10 percent value was not derived from a single point 
estimate from a particular study, but instead represents a reasonable compromise between 
historical estimates of the rebound effect and forecasts of its projected future value.   
   
4.2.6 Benefits from increased vehicle use  
The increase in vehicle use from the rebound effect provides additional benefits to 
their drivers and occupants, since it is likely to take the form of more frequent trips or travel 
to more distant but desirable destinations.  In either case, it provides benefits to drivers and 
their passengers by improving their access to social and economic opportunities away from 
home.  As evidenced by their decisions to make more frequent or longer trips when improved 
fuel economy reduces their costs for driving, the benefits from this additional travel exceed 
the costs drivers and passengers incur in making those more frequent or longer trips.   
The agencies’ analyses estimate the economic benefits from increased rebound-effect 
driving as the sum of the additional fuel costs drivers incur, plus the consumer surplus they 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-28 
 
receive from the additional accessibility it provides.z  The benefits that drivers and passengers 
receive from additional travel are sufficient to offset these increased fuel costs, and to 
generate consumer surplus – that is, benefits over and above these higher costs.  It should be 
noted that the consumer surplus benefits representing a small fraction of total benefits from 
increased vehicle use. 
4.2.7 Added costs from increased vehicle use 
While it provides some benefits to drivers, increased vehicle use associated with the 
rebound effect also contributes to increased traffic congestion, motor vehicle accidents, and 
highway noise.  Depending on how the additional travel is distributed over the day and on 
where it takes place, additional vehicle use can contribute to traffic congestion and delays by 
increasing traffic volumes on facilities that are already heavily traveled.  These added delays 
impose higher costs on drivers and other vehicle occupants in the form of increased travel 
time and operating expenses.  Because drivers do not take these added costs into account in 
deciding when and where to travel, they must be accounted for separately as a cost of the 
added driving associated with the rebound effect. 
Increased vehicle use due to the rebound effect may also increase the costs associated 
with traffic accidents.  Drivers may take account of the potential costs they (and their 
passengers) face from the possibility of being involved in an accident when they decide to 
make additional trips.  However, they probably do not consider all of the potential costs they 
impose on occupants of other vehicles and on pedestrians when accidents occur.  Thus any 
increase in these “external” accident costs must be considered as another cost of additional 
rebound-effect driving.  Like increased delay costs, any increase in these external accident 
costs caused by added driving is likely to depend on the traffic conditions under which it takes 
place, since accidents are more frequent in heavier traffic (although their severity may be 
reduced by the slower speeds at which heavier traffic typically moves). 
Finally, added vehicle use from the rebound effect may also increase traffic noise.  
Noise generated by vehicles causes inconvenience, irritation, and potentially even discomfort 
to occupants of other vehicles, to pedestrians and other bystanders, and to residents or 
occupants of surrounding property.  Because these effects are unlikely to be taken into 
account by the drivers whose vehicles contribute to traffic noise, they represent additional 
externalities associated with motor vehicle use.  Although there is considerable uncertainty in 
measuring their value, any increase in the economic costs of traffic noise resulting from added 
vehicle use must be included together with other increased external costs from the rebound 
effect. 
To estimate the increased external costs caused by added driving due to the rebound 
effect, EPA and NHTSA rely on estimates of congestion, accident, and noise costs caused by 
                                                 
z
 The consumer surplus provided by added travel is estimated as one-half of the product of the decline in fuel 
cost per mile and the resulting increase in the annual number of miles driven.   
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

automobiles and light trucks developed previously by the Federal Highway Administration.25  
NHTSA employed these estimates previously in its analysis accompanying the MY 2011 final 
rule, and the agencies jointly applied them in the MYs 2012-2016 rulemaking, and the 
agencies continue to find them appropriate for this NPRM.  The values are intended to 
measure the increases in costs (or “marginal” external costs) from added congestion, property 
damages and injuries in traffic accidents, and noise levels caused by automobiles and light 
trucks that are borne by persons other than their drivers and occupants.   
Updated to 2009 dollars, FHWA’s “Middle” estimates for marginal congestion, 
accident, and noise costs caused by automobile use amount to 5.7 cents, 2.4 cents, and 0.1 
cents per vehicle-mile (for a total of 8.2 cents per mile), while those for pickup trucks and 
vans are 5.1 cents, 2.7 cents, and 0.1 cents per vehicle-mile (for a total of 7.9 cents per 
mile).26, aa  These costs are multiplied by the mileage increases attributable to the rebound 
effect to yield the estimated increases in congestion, accident, and noise externality costs 
during future years.     
4.2.8 Petroleum and energy security impacts 
The proposed standards for MYs 2017-2025 will reduce fuel consumption and GHG 
emissions in light-duty vehicles, which will result in improved fuel efficiency and, in turn, 
help to reduce U.S. petroleum imports.  A reduction of U.S. petroleum imports reduces both 
financial and strategic risks caused by potential sudden disruptions in the supply of imported 
petroleum to the U.S.  This reduction in the expected future economic costs associated with 
these risks provides a measure of value of improved U.S. energy security resulting from lower 
petroleum imports.  This section summarizes the agencies’ estimates of U.S. oil import 
reductions and energy security benefits of the proposed Program.  Additional discussion of 
this issue can be found in Section III.H.6 and Section IV of the preamble. 
4.2.8.1 Impact on U.S. petroleum imports 
In 2010, U.S. petroleum import expenditures represented 14 percent of total U.S. 
imports of all goods and services, and this figure rose to 18 percent by April of 2011. 27,28  In 
2010, the United States imported 49 percent of the petroleum it consumed29, while the 
transportation sector accounted for 71 percent of total U.S. petroleum consumption30.  These 
figures compare to approximately 37 percent of U.S. petroleum supplied by imports and 55 
percent of total petroleum consumed by the nation’s transportation sector during 1975.31    
                                                 
aa
 The Federal Highway Administration’s estimates of these costs agree closely with some other recent estimates.  
For example, recent published research conducted by Resources for the Future (RFF) estimates marginal 
congestion and external accident costs for increased light-duty vehicle use in the U.S. to be 3.5 and 3.0 cents per 
vehicle-mile in year-2002 dollars.  See Ian W.H. Parry and Kenneth A. Small, “Does Britain or the U.S. Have 
the Right Gasoline Tax?” Discussion Paper 02-12, Resources for the Future, 19 and Table 1 (March 2002).

Requiring improved fuel economy and lower-GHG vehicle technology in the U.S. is expected 
to lower U.S. petroleum imports. 
Based on analysis of historical and projected future variation in U.S. petroleum 
consumption and imports, EPA and NHTSA estimate that approximately 50 percent of the 
reduction in fuel consumption resulting from adopting improved GHG emission and fuel 
efficiency standards is likely to be reflected in lower U.S. imports of refined fuel, while the 
remaining 50 percent is expected to be reflected in reduced domestic fuel refining.bb  Of this 
latter figure, 90 percent is anticipated to reduce U.S. imports of crude petroleum for use as a 
refinery feedstock, while the remaining 10 percent is expected to reduce U.S. domestic 
production of crude petroleum.cc  Thus, on balance, each gallon of fuel saved as a 
consequence of this proposed rule is anticipated to reduce total U.S. imports of petroleum by 
0.95 gallons.dd   
4.2.8.2 Background on U.S. energy security 
U.S. energy security is broadly defined as protecting the U.S. economy against 
circumstances that threaten significant short- and long-term increases in energy costs or 
interruptions in energy supplies.  Most discussions of U.S. energy security focus on the 
economic costs of U.S. dependence on oil imports, and particularly on U.S. reliance on oil 
imported from potentially unstable sources.  In addition, oil exporters have the ability to raise 
the price of oil by exerting monopoly power through the mechanism of a cartel, the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  These factors contribute to the 
vulnerability of the U.S. economy to episodic oil supply shocks and price spikes.  In 2010, 
total U.S. imports of crude oil, including those from OPEC nations as well as other sources, 
were $269 billion (in 2009$)32 (see Figure 4-2).

 Differences in forecasted annual U.S. imports of crude petroleum and refined products among the Reference, 
High Oil Price, and Low Oil Price scenarios analyzed in EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2011 range from 35-74

average 53 percent over the forecast period spanned by AEO 2011.

 Differences in forecasted annual U.S. imports of crude petroleum among the Reference, High Oil Price, and

AEO 2011.

 One effect of the EPA/NHTSA joint proposal (as well as the 2012-2016 light-duty 
vehicle standards and the 2014-2018 standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and 
engines) will be to reduce consumption of transportation fuels in the U.S.  This will in turn 
reduce U.S. oil imports, which lowers both financial and strategic risks associated with 
potential disruptions in supply or sudden increases in the price of petroleum.  For this 
proposed rule, an “oil import premium” approach is utilized to estimate energy security-
related costs of importing petroleum into the U.S.  Specifically, the oil import premium 
measures the expected economic value of costs that are not reflected in the market price of 
petroleum, and that are expected to change in response to an incremental change in the level 
of U.S. oil imports. 
4.2.8.3 Methodology used to estimate U.S. energy security benefits 
 In order to understand the energy security implications of reducing U.S. oil imports, 
EPA has worked with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has developed 
approaches for evaluating the social costs and energy security implications of oil use.  The 
energy security estimates provided below are based upon a methodology developed in a peer-
reviewed study entitled, “The Energy Security Benefits of Reduced Oil Use, 2006-2015,” 
completed in March 2008.  This study is included as part of the docket for this proposal.33   
When conducting this recent analysis, ORNL considered the full cost of importing 
petroleum into the U.S.  The full economic cost is defined to include two components in

addition to the purchase price of petroleum itself.  These are: (1) the higher costs for oil 
imports resulting from the effect of U.S. import demand on the world oil price and on OPEC 
market power (i.e., the “demand” or “monopsony” costs); and (2) the risk of reductions in 
U.S. economic output and disruption of the U.S. economy caused by sudden disruptions in the 
supply of imported oil to the U.S. (i.e., macroeconomic disruption and adjustment costs).  
Costs associated with maintaining a U.S. military presence to help secure stable oil supply 
from potentially vulnerable regions of the world were not included in this analysis, because 
attributing costs for military operations to specific missions or activities is difficult (as 
discussed further below).   
For this analysis, ORNL estimated energy security premiums by incorporating the 
most recent available AEO 2011 Reference Case oil price forecasts and market trends.  
Energy security premiums for the years 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2035 and beyond are presented 
in Table 4-11, as well as a breakdown of the components of the energy security premiums for 
each of these years.ff The oil security premium rises over the future as a result of changing 
factors such as the world oil price, global supply/demand balances, U.S. oil imports and 
consumption, and U.S. GDP (i.e., the size of economy at risk to oil shocks).  The principal 
factor is steadily rising world oil prices, but other effects interact.  From 2020 to 2030, the 
macroeconomic disruption and adjustment component rises by 17% by 2030 and then 
stabilizes, over a period where projected average real world oil prices rise 15%.  U.S. oil 
import quantities fall by 3% but total domestic oil consumption still rises by 3% despite 
higher prices.  Looked at another way, U.S. GDP, the size of the economy potentially at risk 
to oil shocks, grows 30%, while the value share of oil in GDP stays high, declining only 9%  
by 2030. 
The components of the energy security premiums and their values are discussed 
below.  Section III.H.7 of the preamble contains a detailed discussion of how the monopsony 
and macroeconomic disruption/adjustment components were treated for this analysis.

4.2.8.4  Monopsony Effect  
The first component of the full economic costs of importing petroleum into the U.S. 
follows from the effect of U.S. import demand on the world oil price over the long-run.  
Because the U.S. is a sufficiently large purchaser of foreign oil supplies, it exercises 
“monopsony power” in the global petroleum market.  This means that increases in U.S. 
petroleum demand can cause the world price of crude oil to rise, and conversely, that reduced 
U.S. petroleum demand can reduce the world price of crude oil. Since this component of the 
energy security premium is a transfer between the U.S. and oil exporting countries, it is 
excluded from the benefit estimates of these proposed rules. See more discussion of this topic 
in Section 4.2.8.7. 
 
Thus, one benefit of reducing U.S. oil purchases, due both to reductions in overall 
energy consumption in transportation and substitution of transportation fuels derived from 
non-petroleum sources, is the potential decrease in the total dollar value of U.S. crude oil 
purchases.  Because lower U.S. oil purchases reduce the price paid for each barrel, the decline 
in the dollar value of U.S. petroleum purchases exceeds the savings that would result if the 
global price for oil remained unchanged.  The amount by which it does so – which reflects the 
effect of U.S. monopsony power over the world oil price – represents the demand or 
monopsony effect of reduced U.S. petroleum consumption.  
This demand or monopsony effect can be readily illustrated with an example.  If the 
U.S. imports 10 million barrels per day at a world oil price of $50 per barrel, its total daily bill 
for oil imports is $500 million.  If a decrease in U.S. imports to 9 million barrels per day 
causes the world oil price to drop to $49 per barrel, the daily U.S. oil import bill drops to $441 
million (9 million barrels times $49 per barrel).  While the world oil price declines by only $1, 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-34 
 
the resulting decrease in oil purchases equals $59 million per day ($500 million minus $441 
million).  This is equivalent to an incremental savings of $59 for each barrel by which U.S. oil 
imports decline ($59 million per day divided by 1 million barrels per day), or $10 more than 
the newly-decreased world price of $49 per barrel.   
This additional $10 per barrel reduction in the “monopsony premium” represents the 
incremental external benefits to the U.S. associated with the reduction in import payments 
beyond the savings that would occur if prices remained unchanged.  Of course, this additional 
benefit arises only to the extent that reduction in U.S. oil imports actually affects the world oil 
price.  ORNL estimates this component of the energy security benefit in 2025 to be $11.26 
/barrel by which U.S. petroleum imports are reduced, with a range of $3.78 - $21.48/barrel. 
4.2.8.5 Macroeconomic Disruption and Adjustment Effect    
The second component of the oil import premium, the “macroeconomic disruption and 
adjustment cost premium”, arises from the effect of U.S. oil imports on the expected cost of 
disruptions in oil supply and resulting increases in oil prices.  A sudden increase in oil prices 
triggered by a disruption in world oil supplies has two main effects: (1) it increases the costs 
of oil imports in the short run, further expanding the transfer of U.S. wealth to foreign 
producers, and (2) it can lead to macroeconomic contraction, dislocation and losses in Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP).  ORNL estimates the composite estimate of these two factors that 
comprise the macroeconomic disruption/adjustment costs premium to be $7.77 /barrel in 
2025, with a range of $3.84 – 12.32/barrel of imported oil reduced.  This component of the 
energy security premium is included in the agencies’ estimate of the benefits of the proposed 
rules. See more discussion of how the agencies account for the energy security benefits of the 
proposed rules in Section 4.2.8.7. 
 
During oil price shocks, the higher price of imported oil causes increased payments for 
imports from the U.S to oil exporters.  This increased claim on U.S. economic output is a loss 
to the U.S. that is separate from and additional to any reduction in economic output due to the 
shock.  The increased oil payments during shocks are counted as a loss to the degree that the 
expected price increase is not anticipated and internalized by oil consumers. 
 
Secondly, macroeconomic losses during price shocks reflect both losses in aggregate 
economic output and “allocative” losses.  The former are reductions in the level of output that 
the U.S. economy can produce by fully utilizing its available resources, while the latter stem 
from temporary dislocation and underutilization of available resources due to the shock, such 
as labor unemployment and idle plant capacity.  The aggregate output effect, a reduction in 
“potential” economic output, will persist as long as the price for oil remains elevated.  Thus 
its magnitude depends on the extent and duration of any disruption in the world supply of oil, 
since these factors determine the extent of the resulting increase in prices for petroleum 
products, as well as whether and how rapidly these prices return to their pre-disruption levels. 
In addition to the aggregate contraction, there are “allocative” or “adjustment” costs 
associated with dislocations in energy markets.  Because supply disruptions and resulting 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

price increases occur suddenly, empirical evidence shows they also impose additional costs on 
businesses and households for adjusting their use of petroleum and other productive factors 
more rapidly than if the same price increase had occurred gradually.  Dislocation effects 
include the unemployment of workers and other resources during the time period required for 
their inter-industry or interregional reallocation, as well as pauses in capital investment due to 
uncertainty.  These adjustments temporarily reduce the level of economic output that can be 
achieved even below the “potential” output level that would ultimately be reached once the 
economy’s adaptation to higher petroleum prices was complete.  The additional costs imposed 
on businesses and households for making these adjustments reflect their limited ability to 
adjust prices, output levels, and their use of energy, labor and other inputs quickly and 
smoothly in response to rapid changes in prices for petroleum products. 
Since future disruptions in foreign oil supplies are an uncertain prospect, each of the 
disruption cost components must be weighted by the probability that the supply of petroleum 
to the U.S. will actually be disrupted.  Thus, the “expected value” of these costs – the product 
of the probability that a supply disruption will occur and the sum of costs from reduced 
economic output and the economy’s abrupt adjustment to sharply higher petroleum prices – is 
the relevant measure of their magnitude.  Further, when assessing the energy security value of 
a policy to reduce oil use, only the change in these expected costs from potential disruptions 
that results from the policy is relevant.  The expected costs of disruption may change from 
lowering the normal (i.e., pre-disruption) level of domestic petroleum use and imports, from 
any induced alteration in the likelihood or size of disruption, or from altering the short-run 
flexibility  in substituting other energy sources or inputs for petroleum use.  
In summary, the steps needed to calculate the disruption or security premium are: (1) 
determine the likelihood of an oil supply disruption in the future; (2) assess the likely impacts 
of a potential oil supply disruption on the world oil price; (3) assess the impact of the oil price 
shock on the U.S. economy (in terms of import costs and macroeconomic losses); and (4) 
determine how these costs are likely to change with the level of U.S. oil imports. The 
reduction in the expected value of costs and other macroeconomic losses that results from 
lower oil imports represents the macroeconomic and adjustment cost portion of the oil import 
premium. 
4.2.8.6  Cost of existing U.S. energy security policies 
The last often-identified component of the full economic costs of U.S. oil imports is 
the costs to the U.S. taxpayers of existing U.S. energy security policies.  The two primary 
components of this cost are likely to be (1) the expenses associated with maintaining a U.S. 
military presence – in part to help secure a stable oil supply – in potentially unstable regions 
of the world; and (2) costs for maintaining the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The 
SPR is the largest stockpile of government-owned emergency crude oil in the world.  
Established in the aftermath of the 1973-74 oil embargo, the SPR provides the U.S. a response 
option should price increases triggered by a disruption in commercial oil supplies threaten the 
U.S. economy.  It also allows the U.S. to meet part of its International Energy Agency 
obligation to maintain emergency oil stocks, and it provides a national defense fuel reserve.  
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-36 
 
The agencies recognize that potential national and energy security risks exist due to 
the possibility of tension over oil supplies.  Much of the world’s oil and gas supplies are 
located in countries facing social, economic, and demographic challenges, thus making them 
even more vulnerable to potential local instability.  For example, in 2010 just over 40 percent 
of world oil supply came from OPEC nations, and this share is not expected to decline in the 
AEO 2011 projections through 2030.  Approximately 28 percent of global supply is from 
Persian Gulf countries alone.  As another measure of concentration, of the 137 
countries/principalities that export either crude oil or refined petroleum product, the top 12 
have recently accounted for over 55 percent of exports.gg  Eight of these countries are 
members of OPEC, and a 9th is Russia.hh  In a market where even a 1-2 percent supply loss 
raises prices noticeably, and where a 10 percent supply loss could lead to a significant price 
shock, this regional concentration is of concern.  Historically, the countries of the Middle East 
have been the source of eight of the ten major world oil disruptions34 with the 9th originating 
in Venezuela, an OPEC member.  
Because of U.S. dependence on oil, the military could be called on to protect energy 
resources through such measures as securing shipping lanes from foreign oil fields.  To 
maintain such military effectiveness and flexibility, the Department of Defense identified in 
the Quadrennial Defense Review that it is “increasing its use of renewable energy supplies 
and reducing energy demand to improve operational effectiveness, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions in support of U.S. climate change initiatives, and protect the Department from 
energy price fluctuations.”35  The Department of the Navy has also stated that the Navy and 
Marine Corps rely far too much on petroleum, which “degrades the strategic position of our 
country and the tactical performance of our forces.  The global supply of oil is finite, it is 
becoming increasingly difficult to find and exploit, and over time cost continues to rise.”36   
In remarks given to the White House Energy Security Summit on April 26, 2011, 
Deputy Security of Defense William J. Lynn, III noted the direct impact of energy security on 
military readiness and flexibility.  According to Deputy Security Lynn, “Today, energy 
technology remains a critical element of our military superiority.  Addressing energy needs 
must be a fundamental part of our military planning.”37   
Thus, to the degree to which the proposed rules reduce reliance upon imported energy 
supplies or promotes the development of technologies that can be deployed by either 
consumers or the nation’s defense forces, the United States could expect benefits related to 
national security, reduced energy costs, and increased energy supply.  These benefits are why 
President Obama has identified this program as a key component for improving energy 
efficiency and putting America on a path to reducing oil imports in the Blueprint for a Secure 
Energy Future.38

Although the agencies recognize that there clearly is a benefit to the United States 
from reducing dependence on foreign oil, the agencies have been unable to calculate the 
monetary benefit that the United States will receive from the improvements in national 
security expected to result from this program.  In contrast, the other portion of the energy 
security premium, the U.S. macroeconomic disruption and adjustment cost that arises from 
U.S. petroleum imports, is included in the energy security benefits estimated for this program.  
To summarize, the agencies have included only the macroeconomic disruption portion of the 
energy security benefits to estimate the monetary value of the total energy security benefits of 
this program.  The agencies have calculated energy security in very specific terms, as the 
reduction of both financial and strategic risks caused by potential sudden disruptions in the 
supply of imported petroleum to the U.S.  Reducing the amount of oil imported reduces those 
risks, and thus increases the nation’s energy security.   
Potential savings in U.S. military costs are excluded from the analysis performed by 
ORNL, because their attribution to particular missions or activities is difficult.  Most military 
forces serve a broad range of security and foreign policy objectives.  Attempts to attribute 
some share of U.S. military costs to oil imports are further complicated challenged by the 
need to estimate how those costs vary with incremental variations in U.S. oil imports.  
Similarly, while the costs for building and maintaining the SPR are more clearly related to 
U.S. oil use and imports, these costs have not varied historically in response to changes in 
U.S. oil import levels. Thus while the influence of the SPR on oil price increases resulting 
from a disruption of U.S oil imports is reflected in the ORNL estimate of the macroeconomic 
and adjustment cost component of the oil import premium, potential changes in the cost of 
maintaining the SPR associated with variation in U.S petroleum imports are excluded.  
4.2.8.7 Total Energy Security Benefits 
Much of the literature on the energy security for the last two decades has routinely 
combined the monopsony and the macroeconomic disruption components when calculating 
the total value of the energy security premium.  However, in the context of using a global 
social cost of carbon (SCC) value, the question arises: how should the energy security 
premium be measured from a global perspective?  Monopsony benefits largely represent a 
reduction in payments by consumers of petroleum products in the United States to foreign oil 
producers that result from a decrease in the world oil price as the U.S. decreases its petroleum 
consumption.  
Although a reduction in these payments clearly represents a benefit to the U.S. when 
considered from a domestic perspective, it represents an exactly offsetting loss to petroleum-
producing countries.  Given the purely redistributive nature of this monopsony effect when 
viewed from a global perspective, it is excluded in the energy security benefits calculations 
for this program. In contrast, the other portion of the energy security premium, the U.S. 
macroeconomic disruption and adjustment cost that arises from U.S. petroleum imports, does 
not have offsetting impacts outside of the U.S., and is thus included in the energy security 
benefits estimated for this program.  Thus, the agencies have included only the 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-38 
 
macroeconomic disruption portion of the energy security benefits to estimate the monetary 
value of the total energy security benefits of this program.  
 The energy security analysis conducted for this proposal estimates that the world price 
of oil will fall modestly in response to lower U.S. demand for refined fuel.  One potential 
result of this decline in the world price of oil would be an increase in the consumption of 
petroleum products, particularly outside the U.S.   In addition, other fuels could be displaced 
from the increasing use of oil worldwide.  For example, if a decline in the world oil price 
causes an increase in oil use in China, India, or another country’s industrial sector, this 
increase in oil consumption may displace natural gas usage.  Alternatively, the increased oil 
use could result in a decrease in coal used to produce electricity.  An increase in the 
consumption of petroleum products particularly outside the U.S., could lead to a modest 
increase in emissions of greenhouse gases, criteria air pollutants, and airborne toxics from 
their refining and use.  However, lower usage of, for example, displaced coal would result in a 
decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.  Therefore, any assessment of the impacts on GHG 
emissions from a potential increase in world oil demand would need to take into account the 
impacts on all portions of the global energy sector.  The agencies’ analyses have not 
attempted to estimate these effects.  
4.2.9 Air pollutant emissions 
Car and light truck use, fuel refining, and fuel distribution and retailing also generate 
emissions of certain criteria air pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon 
compounds (usually referred to as “volatile organic compounds,” or VOC), nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).  Emissions of most of these 
pollutants are associated with the number of vehicle miles driven, rather than with the 
quantity of fuel consumed.  Sulfur dioxide is an exception, as described below. While 
reductions in fuel refining and distribution that result from lower fuel consumption will 
reduce emissions of criteria pollutants, additional vehicle use associated with the rebound 
effect will increase emissions of most of these pollutants.   
Thus the net effect of stricter fuel efficiency and GHG standards on total emissions of 
each criteria pollutant depends on the relative magnitudes of reduced emissions during fuel 
refining and distribution, and increases in emissions from vehicle use.  Because the 
relationship between emission rates (emissions per gallon refined of fuel or mile driven) in 
fuel refining and vehicle use is different for each criteria pollutant, the net effect of increases 
in fuel efficiency and GHG standards on total emissions of each pollutant differs.   
4.2.9.1 Emissions of criteria air pollutants 
For the analysis of criteria emissions over the lifetime of the model years covered by 
this rule, EPA and NHTSA estimate the increases in emissions of each criteria air pollutant 
from additional vehicle use by multiplying the increase in total miles driven by cars and light 
trucks of each model year and age by their estimated emission rates per vehicle-mile of each 
pollutant.  These emission rates differ between cars and light trucks as well as between 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-39 
 
gasoline and diesel vehicles, and both their values for new vehicles and the rates at which they 
increase with age and accumulated mileage can vary among model years.  With the exception 
of SO2, the agencies calculated the increase in emissions of these criteria pollutants from 
added car and light truck use by multiplying the estimated increases in vehicle use during 
each year over their expected lifetimes by per-mile emission rates appropriate to each vehicle 
type, fuel used, model year, and age as of that future year.   
As in the MY 2012-2016 rulemaking, the relevant emission rates were estimated by 
U.S. EPA using the most recent version of the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator 
(MOVES2010a).39  The MOVES model assumes that the per-mile rates at which these 
pollutants are emitted are determined by EPA regulations and the effectiveness of after-
treatment of engine exhaust emissions, and are thus unaffected by changes in car and light 
truck fuel economy.  The MOVES modeling conducted for this proposal is assuming RFS2 
volumes of renewable fuel volumes in both the “reference case” and the control case.ii  The 
emission analysis assumed a 10% ethanol fuel supply.jjAs a consequence, the downstream 
impacts of required increases in fuel economy on emissions of these pollutants from car and 
light truck use are determined entirely by the increases in driving that result from the fuel 
economy rebound effect.   
Emission factors in the MOVES database are expressed in the form of grams per 
vehicle-hour of operation.  To convert these emission factors to grams per mile, MOVES was 
run for the year 2050, and was programmed to report aggregate emissions from vehicle start, 
running, brake and tirewear and crankcase exhaust operations.  EPA analysts selected the year 
2050 in order to generate emission factors that were representative of lifetime average 
emission rates for vehicles meeting the agency’s Tier 2 emission standard.kk  Separate 
estimates were developed for each vehicle type and model year, as well as for each state and 
month, in order to reflect the effects of regional and temporal variation in temperature and 
other relevant variables on emissions.   
The MOVES emissions estimates were then summed to the model year level and 
divided by total distance traveled by vehicles of that model year in order to produce per-mile 
emission factors for each pollutant.  The resulting emission rates represent average values 
across the nation, and incorporate typical variation in temperature and other operating 
conditions affecting emissions over an entire calendar year.  These national average rates also 
                                                 
ii
 The agencies assume 100 percent E10 in both the reference and control cases, which is a simplifying 
assumption that is appropriate to the level of detail necessary for this proposal’s analysis.   
jj
 More discussion on fuel supply and this rule is in Preamble Section III.F 
kk
 Because all light-duty emission rates in MOVES2010a are assumed to be invariant after MY 2010, a calendar-
year 2050 run produced a full set of emission rates that reflect anticipated deterioration in the effectiveness of 
vehicles’ emission control systems with increasing age and accumulated mileage for post-MY 2010 vehicles.  
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-40 
 
reflect county-specific differences in fuel composition, as well as in the presence and type of 
vehicle inspection and maintenance programs.ll   
Emission rates for the criteria pollutant SO2 were calculated by using average fuel 
sulfur content estimates supplied by EPA, together with the simplifying assumption that the 
entire sulfur content of fuel is emitted in the form of SO2.  These calculations assumed that 
national average gasoline and diesel sulfur levels would remain at current levels.mm   
Therefore, unlike many other criteria pollutants, sulfur dioxide emissions from vehicle use 
decline in proportion to the decrease in fuel consumption. 
Emissions of criteria air pollutants also occur during each phase of fuel production and 
distribution, including crude oil extraction and transportation, fuel refining, and fuel storage 
and transportation.  The reduction in emissions during each of these phases depends on the 
extent to which fuel savings result in lower imports of refined fuel, or in reduced domestic 
fuel refining.  To a lesser extent, they also depend on whether reductions in domestic gasoline 
refining are reflected in reduced imports of crude oil or in reduced domestic extraction of 
petroleum.   
Both EPA’s and NHTSA’s analyses assume that reductions in imports of refined fuel 
would reduce criteria pollutant emissions during fuel storage and distribution only.  
Reductions in domestic fuel refining using imported crude oil as a feedstock are assumed to 
reduce emissions during fuel refining, storage, and distribution, because each of these 
activities would be reduced.  Finally, reduced domestic fuel refining using domestically-
produced crude oil is assumed to reduce emissions during all phases of fuel production and 
distribution.nn 
EPA estimated the reductions in criteria pollutant emissions from producing and 
distributing fuel that would occur under alternative fuel efficiency and GHG standards using 
emission rates obtained from Argonne National Laboratories’ Greenhouse Gases and 
Regulated Emissions in Transportation (GREET) model.40  The GREET model provides 
separate estimates of air pollutant emissions that occur in four phases of fuel production and 
distribution: crude oil extraction, crude oil transportation and storage, fuel refining, and fuel 
                                                 
ll
 The national mix of fuel types includes county-level market shares of conventional and reformulated gasoline, 
as well as county-level variation in sulfur content, ethanol fractions, and other fuel properties.  
Inspection/maintenance programs at the county level account for detailed program design elements such as test 
type, inspection frequency, and program coverage by vehicle type and age.   
mm
 These are 30 and 15 parts per million (ppm, measured on a mass basis) for gasoline and diesel respectively, 
which produces emission rates of  0.17 grams of SO2 per gallon of gasoline and 0.10 grams per gallon of diesel. 
nn
 In effect, this assumes that the distances crude oil travels to U.S. refineries are approximately the same 
regardless of whether it travels from domestic oilfields or import terminals, and that the distances that gasoline 
travels from refineries to retail stations are approximately the same as those from import terminals to gasoline 
stations.

distribution and storage.oo  EPA modified the GREET model to change certain assumptions 
about emissions during crude petroleum extraction and transportation, as well as to update its 
emission rates to reflect adopted and pending EPA emission standards.  EPA also 
incorporated emission factors for the air toxics estimated in this analysis: benzene, 1,3-
butadiene, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and formaldehyde.  The resulting emission factors are 
shown in Table 4-12.   
 
                                                 
oo
 Emissions that occur during vehicle refueling at retail gasoline stations (primarily evaporative emissions of 
volatile organic compounds, or VOCs) are already accounted for in the “tailpipe” emission factors used to 
estimate the emissions generated by increased light truck use.  GREET estimates emissions in each phase of 
gasoline production and distribution in mass per unit of gasoline energy content; these factors are then converted 
to mass per gallon of gasoline using the average energy content of gasoline.

  The petroleum extraction and transport emission factors are only applied to domestic crude oil.   
2
  Refinery emissions factors are applied to domestic refineries, whether refining domestic or imported crude.  
3
  Fuel transport, storage, and distribution emission factors represent domestic emissions and are applied to all 
finished fuel, whether refined domestically or internationally.  
The agency converted these emission rates from the mass per fuel energy content basis 
on which GREET reports them to mass per gallon of fuel supplied using the estimates of fuel 
energy content reported by GREET.  The resulting emission rates were applied to both EPA’s 
and NHTSA’s estimates of fuel consumption under alternative fuel efficiency standards to 
develop estimates of total emissions of each criteria pollutant during fuel production and 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

distribution.  The assumptions about the effects of changes in fuel consumption on domestic 
and imported sources of fuel supply discussed above were then employed to calculate the 
effects of reductions in fuel use from alternative fuel efficiency and GHG standards on 
changes in domestic emissions of each criteria pollutant throughout the fuel supply and 
distribution process.  
Electricity emission factors were derived from EPA’s Integrated Planning Model 
(IPM).  EPA uses IPM to analyze the projected impact of environmental policies on the 
electric power sector in the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Developed by 
ICF Consulting, Inc. and used to support public and private sector clients, IPM is a multi-
regional, dynamic, deterministic linear programming model of the U.S. electric power sector. 
It provides forecasts of least-cost capacity expansion, electricity dispatch, and emission 
control strategies for meeting energy demand and environmental, transmission, dispatch, and 
reliability constraints. IPM can be used to evaluate the cost and emissions impacts of 
proposed policies to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon 
dioxide (CO2), and mercury (Hg) from the electric power sector.  
Among the factors that make IPM particularly well suited to model multi-emissions 
control programs are (1) its ability to capture complex interactions among the electric power, 
fuel, and environmental markets; (2) its detail-rich representation of emission control options 
encompassing a broad array of retrofit technologies along with emission reductions through 
fuel switching, changes in capacity mix and electricity dispatch strategies; and (3) its 
capability to model a variety of environmental market mechanisms, such as emissions caps, 
allowances, trading, and banking. 
For this analysis, EPA derived national emission factors  from an IPM version 4.10 
run for the “Proposed Transport Rule .41”  IPM provided national emission totals and power 
generation totals for VOC, CO, NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 in 2015, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050.  
EPA divided these sums to derive national average emission factors, and interpolated in 
intermediate years.  Emissions factors for air toxics were derived from the 2002 National 
Emission Inventory in conjunction with the IPM estimates.  The emission factors for 
electricity was adjusted upwards by six percent in order to properly capture the feedstock 
gathering that occurs upstream of the powerplant. pp Feedstock gathering includes the 
gathering, transporting, and preparing fuel for electricity generation. This adjustment factor is 
consistent with those discussed in the MY 2012-2016 Final Rule.qq   
This analytic method makes the simplifying assumption that the electricity generation 
due to this rulemaking produces emissions at the national average level.  EPA plans to further

 The factor of 1.06 to account for GHG emissions associated with feedstock extraction, transportation, and

examine the implications of this assumption in the final rulemaking, as discussed in Section 
III.C. 
The agencies account for all electricity consumed by the vehicle.  For calculations of 
GHG emissions from electricity generation, the total energy consumed from the battery is 
divided by 0.9 to account for charging losses, and by 0.93 to account for losses during 
transmission. Both values were discussed in the MYs 2012-2016 rule as well as the Interim 
Joint TAR, and are unchanged from those analyses. The estimate of charging losses is based 
upon engineering judgment and manufacturer Confidential Business Information (CBI). The 
estimate of transmission losses is consistent, although not identical to the 8% estimate used in 
GREET, as well as the 6% estimate in eGrid 2010.42,43    The upstream emission factor is 
applied to total electricity production, rather than simply power consumed at the wheel. rr 
The derived set of electricity emission factors was employed by both agencies. 
Finally, EPA and NHTSA calculated the net changes in domestic emissions of each 
criteria pollutant by summing the increases in its emissions projected to result from increased 
vehicle use, electricity production, and the reductions in emissions anticipated to result from 
lower domestic fuel refining and distribution.ss  As indicated previously, the effect of adopting 
improved fuel efficiency and GHG standards on total emissions of each criteria pollutant 
depends on the relative magnitudes of the resulting reduction in emissions from fuel refining 
and distribution, and the increase in emissions from additional vehicle use.   
4.2.9.2 Estimated values of reducing PM-related emissions in the model year 
analysis 
The agencies’ analysis of PM2.5-related benefits over the lifetime of specific model 
years uses a “benefit-per-ton” method to estimate selected PM2.5-related health benefits.  
These PM2.5-related benefit-per-ton estimates provide the total monetized human health 
benefits (the sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) of reducing one ton of 
directly emitted PM2.5, or one ton of a pollutant that contributes to secondarily-formed PM2.5 
(such as NOx, SOx, and VOCs) from a specified source.   
Ideally, the human health benefits would be estimated based on changes in ambient 
PM2.5 concentrations and population exposure, as determined by complete air quality and 
exposure modeling.  However, conducting such detailed modeling was not possible within the 
timeframe for this proposal.  Note that EPA will conduct full-scale photochemical air quality 
                                                 
rr
 By contrast, consumer electricity costs would not include the power lost during transmission.  While 
consumers indirectly pay for this lost power through higher rates, this power does not appear on their electric 
meter.   
ss
 All emissions from increased vehicle use are assumed to occur within the U.S., since fuel efficiency standards  
would apply only to vehicles produced for sale in the U.S.

modeling for selected future calendar years as part of the air quality analysis it conducts for 
the final rule. 
Due to analytical limitations, the estimated benefit-per-ton values do not include 
comparable benefits related to reductions in other ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants 
(such as ozone, NO2 or SO2) or toxic air pollutants, nor do they monetize all of the potential 
health and welfare effects associated with PM2.5 or the other criteria pollutants.  As a result, 
monetizing PM-related health impacts alone underestimates the benefits associated with 
reductions of the suite of non-GHG pollutants that would be reduced by the proposed 
standards.   
The dollar-per-ton estimates used to monetize reductions in emissions that contribute 
to ambient concentrations of PM2.5 are provided in Table 4-13.

a The benefit-per-ton estimates presented in this table are based on an estimate of premature mortality derived 
from the ACS study (Pope et al., 2002).  If the benefit-per-ton estimates were based on the Six-Cities study 
(Laden et al., 2006), the values would be approximately 245% (nearly two-and-a-half times larger).  See below 
for a description of these studies. 
b
 The benefit-per-ton estimates presented in this table assume either a 3 percent or 7 percent discount rate in the 
valuation of premature mortality to account for a twenty-year segmented cessation lag.   
c
 Benefit-per-ton values were estimated for the years 2015, 2020, and 2030.  For intermediate years, such as 
2017 (the year the standards begin), we interpolated exponentially.  For years beyond 2030 (including 2040), 
EPA and NHTSA extrapolated exponentially based on the growth between 2020 and 2030. 
d
 Note that the benefit-per-ton value for SOx is based on the value for Stationary (Non-EGU) sources; no SOx 
value was estimated for mobile sources.  The benefit-per-ton value for VOCs was estimated across all sources. 
e
 Non-EGU denotes stationary sources of emissions other than electric generating units (EGUs). 
As Table 4-13 indicates, EPA projects that the per-ton values for reducing emissions 
of criteria pollutants from both vehicle use and stationary sources such as fuel refineries and 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

storage facilities will increase over time.tt  These projected increases reflect rising income 
levels, which are assumed to increase affected individuals’ willingness to pay for reduced 
exposure to health threats from air pollution.  They also reflect future population growth and 
increased life expectancy, which expands the size of the population exposed to air pollution in 
both urban and rural areas, especially in older age groups with the highest mortality risk.44,uu   
For certain PM2.5-related pollutants (such as direct PM2.5 and NOx), EPA estimates 
different per-ton values for reducing  mobile source emissions than for reductions in 
emissions of the same pollutant from stationary sources such as fuel refineries and storage 
facilities.  These reflect differences in the typical geographic distributions of emissions of 
each pollutant by different sources, their contributions to ambient levels of PM2.5, and 
resulting changes in population exposure.  EPA and NHTSA apply these separate values to its 
estimates of changes in emissions from vehicle use and from fuel production and distribution 
to determine the net change in total economic damages from emissions of those pollutants.   
The benefit per-ton technique has been used in previous analyses, including the 2012-
2016 Light-Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule,45 the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS) RIA,46 the Portland Cement National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air 
Pollutants (NESHAP) RIA,47 and the final NO2 NAAQS.48  Table 4-14 shows the quantified

Consistent with the NO2 NAAQS,vv the benefits estimates utilize concentration-
response functions as reported in the epidemiology literature.  Readers interested in reviewing 
the complete methodology for creating the benefit-per-ton estimates used in this analysis can 
consult the Technical Support Document (TSD)49 accompanying the final ozone NAAQS 
RIA.   Readers can also refer to Fann et al. (2009)50 for a detailed description of the benefit-
per-ton methodology.ww 
As described above, national per-ton estimates were developed for selected 
pollutant/source category combinations.  The per-ton values calculated therefore apply only to 
tons reduced from those specific pollutant/source combinations (e.g., NO2 emitted from 
mobile sources; direct PM emitted from stationary sources).  Our estimate of total PM2.5 
benefits is therefore based on the total direct PM2.5 and PM2.5–related precursor emissions 
(NOx, SOx, and VOCs) controlled from each source and multiplied by the respective per-ton 
values of reducing emissions from that source.   
The benefit-per-ton coefficients in this analysis were derived using modified versions 
of the health impact functions used in the PM NAAQS Regulatory Impact Analysis.  
Specifically, this analysis uses the benefit-per-ton estimates first applied in the Portland 
Cement NESHAP RIA, which incorporated concentration-response functions directly from 
the epidemiology studies, without any adjustment for an assumed threshold.  Removing the 
threshold assumption is a key difference between the method used in this analysis to estimate 
PM co-benefits and the methods used in analyses prior to EPA’s Portland Cement 
NESHAP.xx  As a consequence, the benefit-per-ton estimates used in this analysis include

 Although we summarize the main issues in this chapter, we encourage interested readers to see benefits 
chapter of the NO2 NAAQS for a more detailed description of recent changes to the PM benefits presentation 
and preference for the no-threshold model.   
ww
 The values included in this report are different from those presented in the article cited above.  Benefits 
methods change to reflect new information and evaluation of the science.  Since publication of the June 2009 
article, EPA has made two significant changes to its benefits methods: (1) We no longer assume that a threshold 
exists in PM-related models of health impacts, which is consistent with the findings reported in published 
research; and (2) We have revised the Value of a Statistical Life to equal $6.3 million (year 2000$), up from an 
estimate of $5.5 million (year 2000$) used in the June 2009 report.  Please refer to the following website for

 Based on a review of the current body of scientific literature, EPA estimates PM-related mortality without 
applying an assumed concentration threshold.  EPA‘s Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 2009. Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (Final Report). 
EPA-600-R-08-139F. National Center for Environmental Assessment – RTP Division. December), which was 
reviewed by EPA‘s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency - Science 
Advisory Board. 2009. Review of EPA‘s Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter (First External 
Review Draft, December 2008). EPA-COUNCIL-09-008. May.; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Science 
Advisory Board . 2009. Consultation on EPA‘s Particulate Matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards: 
Scope and Methods Plan for Health Risk and Exposure Assessment. EPA-COUNCIL-09-009. May), concluded 
that the scientific literature consistently finds that a no-threshold log-linear model most adequately portrays the 
PM-mortality concentration-response relationship while recognizing potential uncertainty about the exact shape 
of the concentration-response function.  This assumption is incorporated into the calculation of the PM-related 
benefits-per-ton values.

incremental benefits of reductions in PM2.5 concentrations down to their lowest modeled 
levels.  This approach is also consistent with EPA’s analysis of the 2012-2016 Light-Duty 
Vehicle Greenhouse Gas rule. 
Reductions in PM-related mortality provide the majority of the monetized value in 
each benefit-per-ton estimate.  Typically, the premature mortality-related effect coefficients 
that underlie the benefits-per-ton estimates are drawn from epidemiology studies that examine 
two large population cohorts: the American Cancer Society cohort (Pope et al., 2002)51 and 
the Harvard Six Cities cohort (Laden et al., 2006).52  The concentration-response (C-R) 
function developed from the extended analysis of American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort, as 
reported in Pope et al. (2002), has previously been used by EPA to generate its primary 
benefits estimate.  The extended analysis of the Harvard Six Cities cohort, as reported by 
Laden et al (2006), was published after the completion of the Staff Paper for the 2006 PM2.5 
NAAQS and has been used as an alternative estimate in the PM2.5 NAAQS RIA and PM2.5 co-
benefits estimates in analyses completed since the PM2.5 NAAQS.   
 
These studies provide logical choices for anchor points when presenting PM-related 
benefits because, while both studies are well designed and peer-reviewed, there are strengths 
and weaknesses inherent in each.  Although this argues for using both studies to generate 
benefits estimates, due to the analytical limitations associated with this analysis, EPA and 
NHTSA have chosen to use the benefit-per-ton value derived from the ACS study.  The 
agencies note that benefits would be approximately 245 percent (or nearly two-and-a-half 
times) larger if the per-ton benefit values based on the Harvard Six Cities were used instead. 
As is the nature of benefits analyses, assumptions and methods evolve over time to 
reflect the most current interpretation of the scientific and economic literature.  For a period 
of time (2004-2008), EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) valued mortality risk 
reductions using a value of statistical life (VSL) estimate derived from a limited analysis of 
some of the available studies.  OAR arrived at a VSL using a range of $1 million to $10 
million (2000$) consistent with two meta-analyses of the wage-risk literature.   
The $1 million value represented the lower end of the interquartile range from the 
Mrozek and Taylor (2002)53 meta-analysis of 33 studies.  The $10 million value represented 
the upper end of the interquartile range from the Viscusi and Aldy (2003)54 meta-analysis of 
43 studies.  The mean estimate of $5.5 million (2000$) was also consistent with the mean 
VSL of $5.4 million estimated in the Kochi et al. (2006)55 meta-analysis.  However, the 
Agency neither changed its official guidance on the use of VSL in rulemakings nor subjected 
the interim estimate to a scientific peer-review process through the Science Advisory Board 
(SAB) or other peer-review group.   
Until updated guidance is available, EPA determined that a single, peer-reviewed 
estimate applied consistently best reflects the Science Advisory Board Environmental 
Economics Advisory Committee (SAB-EEAC) advice it has received.  Therefore, EPA has 
decided to apply the VSL that was vetted and endorsed by the SAB in the Guidelines for 
Preparing Economic Analyses (U.S. EPA, 2000)56 while they continue efforts to update their 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

guidance on this issue.yy  This approach calculates a mean value across VSL estimates derived 
from 26 labor market and contingent valuation studies published between 1974 and 1991.  
The mean VSL across these studies is $6.3 million (2000$).  The dollar-per-ton estimates 
used in this analysis are based on this revised VSL.zz 
The benefit-per-ton estimates are subject to a number of assumptions and 
uncertainties.   
 
• They do not reflect local variability in population density, meteorology, exposure, 
baseline health incidence rates, or other local factors that might lead to an 
overestimate or underestimate of the actual benefits of controlling fine particulates in 
specific locations.  Please refer to Chapter 6.3 of EPA’s DRIA for the description of 
the agency’s quantification and monetization of PM- and ozone-related health impacts 
for the proposal. 
• This analysis assumes that all fine particles, regardless of their chemical composition, 
are equally potent in causing premature mortality.  This is an important assumption, 
because PM2.5 produced via transported precursors emitted from stationary sources 
may differ significantly from direct PM2.5 released from engines and other industrial 
sources.  At the present time, however, no clear scientific grounds exist for supporting 
differential effects estimates by particle type.  
• This analysis assumes that the health impact function for fine particles is linear within 
the range of ambient concentrations under consideration.  Thus, the estimates include 
health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas with varied initial concentrations 
of PM2.5, including both regions that are in attainment with fine particle standard and 
those that do not meet the standard, down to the lowest modeled concentrations.  
• There are several health benefits categories that EPA and NHTSA were unable to 
quantify due to limitations associated with using benefits-per-ton estimates, several of 
which could be substantial.   Because NOX and VOC emissions are also precursors to 
ozone, changes in NOX and VOC would also impact ozone formation and the health 
effects associated with ozone exposure.  Benefits-per-ton estimates for ozone do not 
exist due to issues associated with the complexity of the atmospheric air chemistry and 
nonlinearities associated with ozone formation.  The PM-related benefits-per-ton 
estimates also do not include any human welfare or ecological benefits.  Please refer to 
Chapter 6.3 of EPA’s PRIA for a description of the unquantified co-pollutant benefits 
associated with this rulemaking.

 In the update of the Economic Guidelines (U.S. EPA, 2011), EPA retained the VSL endorsed by the SAB with 
the understanding that further updates to the mortality risk valuation guidance would be forthcoming in the near 
future.  The update of the Economic Guidelines is available on the Internet at 
http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/pages/Guidelines.html/$file/Guidelines.pdf.

As mentioned above, emissions changes and benefits-per-ton estimates alone are not a 
good indication of local or regional air quality and health impacts, as the localized impacts 
associated with the rulemaking may vary significantly.  Additionally, the atmospheric 
chemistry related to ambient concentrations of PM2.5, ozone and air toxics is very complex.  
Full-scale photochemical modeling is therefore necessary to provide the needed spatial and 
temporal detail to more completely and accurately estimate the changes in ambient levels of 
these pollutants and their associated health and welfare impacts.   For the final rule, EPA will 
conduct a national-scale air quality modeling analysis in 2030 to analyze the impacts of the 
standards on PM2.5, ozone, and selected air toxics.       
4.2.10 Reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases 
Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) occur throughout the 
process of producing and distributing transportation fuels, as well as from fuel combustion 
itself.  By increasing fuel efficiency and thus reducing the volume of fuel consumed by 
passenger cars and light trucks, the proposed standards will reduce GHG emissions generated 
by fuel use, as well as throughout the fuel supply cycle.  Lowering these emissions is likely to 
slow the projected pace and reduce the ultimate extent of future changes in the global climate, 
thus reducing future economic damages that changes in the global climate are otherwise 
expected to cause.  Further, by reducing the probability that climate changes with potentially 
catastrophic economic or environmental impacts will occur, lowering GHG emissions may 
also result in economic benefits that exceed the resulting reduction in the expected future 
economic costs caused by gradual changes in the earth’s climatic systems.  Quantifying and 
monetizing benefits from reducing GHG emissions is thus an important step in estimating the 
total economic benefits likely to result from establishing improved fuel efficiency and GHG 
standards.   
4.2.10.1 Estimating reductions in GHG emissions 
NHTSA estimates emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from passenger car and light 
truck use by multiplying the number of gallons of each type of fuel (gasoline and diesel) they 
are projected to consume with each alternative CAFE standard in effect by the quantity or 
mass of CO2 emissions released per gallon of fuel consumed.  EPA directly calculates CO2 
emissions from the projected CO2 emissions of each vehicle.  This calculation assumes that 
the entire carbon content of each fuel is ultimately converted to CO2 emissions during the 
combustion process.  The weighted average CO2 content of certification gasoline is estimated 
to be 8,887 grams per gallon, while that of diesel fuel is estimated to be approximately 10,200 
grams per gallon.  For details, please see EPA’s DRIA and NHTSA’s PRIA.   
Although carbon dioxide emissions account for nearly 95 percent of total GHG 
emissions that result from fuel combustion during vehicle use, emissions of other GHGs are 
potentially significant as well because of their higher “potency” as GHGs than that of CO2 
itself.  EPA and NHTSA estimated the increases in emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous 
oxide (N2O) from additional vehicle use by multiplying the increase in total miles driven by 
cars and light trucks of each model year and age by emission rates per vehicle-mile for these 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-51 
 
GHGs.  These emission rates, which differ between cars and light trucks as well as between 
gasoline and diesel vehicles, were estimated by EPA using MOVES 2010a. 
The MOVES model assumes that the per-mile rates at which cars and light trucks emit 
these GHGs are determined by the efficiency of fuel combustion during engine operation and 
chemical reactions that occur during catalytic after-treatment of engine exhaust, and are thus 
independent of vehicles’ fuel consumption rates.  Thus MOVES emission factors for these 
GHGs, which are expressed per mile of vehicle travel, are assumed to be unaffected by 
changes in fuel economy.   
Much like criteria pollutants, emissions of GHGs occur during each phase of fuel 
production and distribution, including crude oil extraction and transportation, fuel refining, 
and fuel storage and transportation.  Emissions of GHGs also occur in generating electricity, 
which the agencies’ analysis anticipates will account for an increased share of energy 
consumption in the model years that would be subject to the proposed rules.  The agencies’ 
analyses assume that reductions in fuel consumption would reduce global GHG emissions 
during all four phases of fuel production and distribution.aaa   Unlike criteria pollutants, the 
agencies report both domestic and international reductions in GHG emissions.   EPA derived 
GHG emission rates corresponding to producing and distributing fuel from Argonne National 
Laboratories’ Greenhouse Gases and Regulated Emissions in Transportation (GREET) 
model.57bbb   
As with the non-GHGs, EPA derived national CO2 emission factors  from the IPM 
version 4.10 run for the “Proposed Transport Rule.58”  This case features almost no change in 
the CO2 emission factors from powerplants between 2012 and 2050 (approximately 1%).  A 
similar methodology was used for CO2 as with the criteria pollutants.  N2O and CH4 
emissions, which are not readily available from IPM, were calculated from eGrid 2007, and 
scaled according to the growth in CO2. These non-CO2 emissions are a small fraction of the 
emissions from power plants, as shown below in Table 4-15.

feedstock gathering 
Increases in emissions of non-CO2 GHGs are converted to equivalent increases in CO2 
emissions using estimates of the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC-134a).ccc  These GWPs are one way of 
accounting for the higher radiative forcing capacity and differing lifetimes of methane and 
nitrous oxide when they are released into the earth’s atmosphere, measured relative to that of 
CO2 itself.  Because these gases differ in atmospheric lifetimes, their relative damages are not 
constant over time. Impacts other than temperature change also vary across gases in ways that 
are not captured by GWP. For instance, CO2 emissions, unlike methane and other greenhouse 
gases, contribute to ocean acidification. Methane contributes to health and ecosystem effects 
arising from increases in tropospheric ozone, while damages from methane emissions are not 
offset by the positive effect of CO2 fertilization.   Noting these caveats, the CO2 equivalents of 
increases in emissions of these gases are then added to the increases in emissions of CO2 itself 
to summarize the effect of the total increase in CO2-equivalent GHG emissions from vehicle 
use.  However, only the CO2 emissions were monetized for purposes of valuing benefits of the 
rule, as discussed in the next section.  
 
4.2.10.2 Economic benefits from reducing GHG emissions 
NHTSA and EPA have taken the economic benefits of reducing CO2 emissions (or 
avoiding damages from increased emissions) into account in developing the proposed GHG 
and CAFE standards and in assessing the economic benefits of the proposed standards.    
Specifically, NHTSA and EPA have assigned dollar values to reductions in carbon dioxide 
(CO2) emissions using estimates of the global “social cost of carbon” (SCC).  The SCC is an 
estimate of the monetized damages associated with an incremental increase in carbon 
emissions in a given year.  It is intended to include (but is not limited to) changes in net 
agricultural productivity, human health, property damages from increased flood risk, and the 
value of ecosystem services due to climate change.  The SCC is expressed in constant dollars 
per additional metric ton of CO2 emissions occurring during a specific year, and is higher for 
                                                 
ccc
 As in the MYs 2012-2016 rules and in the recent MD and HD rulemakings, the global warming potentials 
(GWP) used in this proposal are consistent with the 100-year time frame values in the 2007 Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  At this time, the 1996 IPCC Second 
Assessment Report (SAR) 100-year GWP values are used in the official U.S. greenhouse gas inventory 
submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (per the reporting requirements 
under that international convention, which were last updated in 2006) .  N2O has a 100-year GWP of 298 and 
CH4 has a 100-year GWP of 25 according to the 2007 IPCC AR4. 
 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

more distant future years because the damages caused by an additional ton of emissions 
increase with larger concentrations of CO2 in the earth’s atmosphere. 
The estimates used in this analysis were developed through an interagency process 
that included EPA, DOT/NHTSA, and other executive branch entities, and concluded in 
February 2010.  The interagency group focused on global SCC values because emissions of 
CO2 involve a global externality: greenhouse gases contribute to damages around the world 
wherever they are emitted. Consequently, to address the global nature of the climate change 
problem, the SCC must incorporate the full (global) damages caused by GHG emissions. 
Furthermore, climate change occurs over very long time horizons and represents a problem 
that the United States cannot solve independently.  The February 2010 SCC Technical 
Support Document (SCC TSD) provides a complete discussion of the SCC estimates and the 
methods used to develop them.59    
We first used these SCC estimates in the benefits analysis for the final joint EPA/DOT 
Rulemaking to establish 2012-2016 Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards 
and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards; see the rule’s preamble for discussion about 
application of the SCC (75 FR 25324; 5/7/10).  We have continued to use these estimates in 
other rulemaking analyses, including the Greenhouse Gas Emission Standards and Fuel 
Efficiency Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles (76 FR 57106; 
9/15/11).  Finally, see also preamble Section III.H.5-6, Section IV.C.3.l, EPA RIA Chapter 
7.2, and NHTSA RIA VIII.C for discussion about the application of new SCC estimates to 
this proposed rule.  The SCC estimates corresponding to assumed values of the discount rate 
are shown below in Table 4-16.

 The SCC values apply to emissions occurring during each year 
shown (in 2009 dollars), and represent the present value of future damages as 
of the year shown.   
 As Table 4-16 shows, the SCC estimates selected by the interagency group for use in 
regulatory analyses range from somewhat more than $6 to about $78 (in 2009 dollars) for 
emissions occurring in the year 2017. The first three estimates are based on the average SCC 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis

estimated using different models and reflect discount rates of 5, 3, and 2.5 percent, 
respectively.  The fourth value is included to represent the possibility of higher-than-expected 
impacts from accumulation of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere, and the consequently larger 
economic damages.  For this purpose, the interagency group elected to use the SCC value for 
the 95th percentile at a 3 percent discount rate.   
The value that the interagency group centered its attention on is the average SCC 
estimate at a 3 percent discount rate, or more than $25 per metric ton in 2017.  To capture the 
uncertainties involved in regulatory impact analysis, however, the group emphasized the 
importance of considering the full range of estimated SCC values.  As the table shows, the 
SCC estimates rise over time because future emissions are expected to produce larger 
incremental damages as physical and economic systems become more stressed in response to 
greater climatic change; for example, the central value increases from over $25 per ton of CO2 
in 2017 to almost $34 per ton of CO2 by 2030.   
Reductions in CO2 emissions that are projected to result from lower fuel consumption, 
refining, and distribution during each future year are multiplied by the appropriate SCC 
estimates for that year, to determine the range of total economic benefits from reduced 
emissions during that year.  For internal consistency, these annual benefits are discounted 
back to net present value terms using a discount rate that is consistent with that used to 
develop each SCC estimate.  
Finally, the SCC estimates presented in this analysis exclude the value of changes in 
non-CO2 GHG emissions expected under this program as discussed above in section 4.2.10.1.  
The interagency group did not estimate the social costs of non-CO2 GHG emissions when it 
developed the current social cost of CO2 values.  Although we have not monetized changes in 
non-CO2 GHGs, the value of any increases or reductions should not be interpreted as zero. 
 
4.2.11 The Benefits due to reduced refueling time 
 
No direct estimates of the value of extended vehicle range are readily available, so the 
agencies instead calculate the reduction in the required annual number of refueling cycles due 
to improved fuel economy, and assess the economic value of the resulting benefits.  Chief 
among these benefits is the time that owners save by spending less time both in search of 
fueling stations and in the act of pumping and paying for fuel. 
 
The agencies calculate the economic value of those time savings by applying DOT-
recommended values of travel time savings to our estimates of how much time is saved.60  The 
value of travel time depends on average hourly valuations of personal and business time, 
which are functions of total hourly compensation costs to employers.  The total hourly

compensation cost to employers, inclusive of benefits, in 2009$ is $29.37.ddd  Table 4-17 
demonstrates the agencies’ approach to estimating the value of travel time ($/hour) for both 
urban and rural (intercity) driving.  This approach relies on the use of DOT-recommended 
weights that assign a lesser valuation to personal travel time than to business travel time, as 
well as weights that adjust for the distribution between personal and business travel.

The estimates of the hourly value of urban and rural travel time ($15.50 and $21.71, 
respectively) shown in Table 4-17 must be adjusted to account for the nationwide ratio of 
urban to rural driving.  By applying this adjustment (as shown in Table 4-18), an overall 
estimate of the hourly value of travel time – independent of urban or rural status – may be 
produced.  Note that up to this point, all calculations discussed assume only one adult

 Time spent on personal travel during rural (intercity) travel is valued at a greater rate than that of urban travel.  
There are several reasons behind the divergence in these values: 1) time is scarcer on a long trip; 2) a long trip 
involves complementary expenditures on travel, lodging, food, and entertainment, since time at the destination is 
worth such high costs.

occupant per vehicle.  To fully estimate the average value of vehicle travel time, the agency 
must account for the presence of additional adult passengers during refueling trips.  The 
agencies apply such an adjustment as shown in Table 4-18; this adjustment is performed 
separately for passenger cars and for light trucks, yielding occupancy-adjusted valuations of 
vehicle travel time during refueling trips for each fleet.

Among these characteristics of fueling station visits is the total amount of time spent pumping 
and paying for fuel.  From a separate sample (also part of the TPMS study), researchers 
conducted interviews at the pump to gauge the distances that drivers travel in transit to and 
from fueling stations, how long that transit takes, and how many gallons of fuel are being 
purchased.   
 
For purposes of this analysis of the proposed standards, the NHTSA focused on the 
interview-based responses in which respondents indicated the primary reason for the refueling 
trip was due to a low reading on the gas gauge.jjj  This restriction was imposed so as to 
exclude distortionary effects of those who refuel on a fixed (e.g., weekly) schedule and may 
be unlikely to alter refueling patterns as a result of increased driving range.  The relevant 
TPMS survey data on average refueling trip characteristics are presented below in Table 4-19.

As an illustration of how we estimate the value of extended refueling range, assume a 
small light truck model has an average fuel tank size of approximately 20 gallons, and a 
baseline actual on-road fuel economy of 24 mpg.  TPMS survey data indicate that drivers who 
indicated the primary reason for their refueling trips was a low reading on the gas gauge 
typically refuel when their tanks are 35 percent full (i.e., 13.0 gallons as shown in Table 4-19, 
with 7.0 gallons in reserve).  By this measure, a typical driver would have an effective driving 
range of 312 miles (= 13.0 gallons x 24 mpg) before he or she is likely to refuel.  Increasing 
this model’s actual on-road fuel economy from 24 to 25 mpg would therefore extend its 
effective driving range to 325 miles (= 13.0 gallons x 25 mpg).  Assuming that the truck is 
driven 12,000 miles/year,kkk this 1 mpg improvement in actual on-road fuel economy reduces 
                                                 
jjj
 Approximately 60 percent of respondents indicated “gas tank low” as the primary reason for the refueling trip 
in question.

National Household Travel Survey (NHTS).  See http://nhts.ornl.gov/2009/pub/stt.pdf (table 22, p.48).  12,000 
miles/year is an approximation of a light duty vehicle’s annual mileage during its initial decade of use (the 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-59 
 
the expected number of refueling trips per year from 38.5 (= 12,000 miles per year / 312 miles 
per refueling) to 36.9 (= 12,000 miles per year / 325 miles per refueling), or 1.6 refuelings per 
year.  If a typical fueling cycle for a light truck requires a total of 6.83 minutes, then the 
annual value of time saved due to that 1 mpg improvement would amount to $3.94 (= 
(6.83/60) x $21.62 x 1.6). 
In the analysis, we repeat this calculation for each future calendar year that light-duty 
vehicles of each model year affected by the alternative standards considered in this rule would 
remain in service.  The resulting cumulative lifetime valuations of time savings account for 
both the reduction over time in the number of vehicles of a given model year that remain in 
service and the reduction in the number of miles (VMT) driven by those that stay in service.  
We also adjust the value of time savings that will occur in future years both to account for 
expected annual growth in real wages and to apply a discount rate to determine the net present 
value of time saved.lll  A final adjustment is made to account for evidence from the TPMS 
study which suggests that 40 percent of refueling trips are for reasons other than a low reading 
on the gas gauge; it is therefore assumed that only 60 percent of the theoretical refueling time 
savings will be realized, as we assume that owners who refuel on a fixed schedule will 
continue to do.The assumption that the 40 percent of refueling trips that occur for reasons 
other than a low reading on the gas gauge will not realize a refueling time savings may be a 
conservative assumption. Results are calculated separately for a given model year’s fleet of 
passenger cars and that year’s fleet of light trucks.  Valuations of both fleets’ benefits are then 
summed to determine the benefit across all light-duty vehicles. 
Since a reduction in the expected number of annual refueling trips leads to a decrease 
in miles driven to and from fueling stations, we can also calculate the value of consumers’ 
fuel savings associated with this decrease.  As shown in Table 4-19, the typical incremental 
round-trip mileage per refueling cycle is 1.08 miles for light trucks and 0.97 miles for 
passenger cars.  Going back to the earlier example of a light truck model, a decrease of 1.6 in 
the number of refuelings per year leads to a reduction of 1.73 miles driven per year (= 1.6 
refuelings x 1.08 miles driven per refueling).  Again, if this model’s actual on-road fuel 
economy was 24 mpg, the reduction in miles driven yields an annual savings of 
approximately 0.07 gallons of fuel (= 1.73 miles / 24 mpg), which at $3.44/gallonmmm results 
in a savings of $0.25 per year to the owner.  Note that this example is illustrative only of the 
approach the agencies uses to quantify this benefit; in practice, the value of this benefit is 
                                                                                                                                                        
period in which the bulk of benefits are realized).  The VOLPE model estimates VMT by model year and vehicle 
age, taking into account the rebound effect, secular growth rates in VMT, and fleet survivability; these 
complexities are omitted in the above example for simplicity. 
lll
 A 1.1 percent annual rate of growth in real wages is used to adjust the value of travel time per vehicle ($/hour) 
for future years for which a given model is expected to remain in service.  This rate is supported by a BLS 
analysis of growth in real wages from 2000 – 2009.  See http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110224.htm.

modeled using fuel price forecasts for each year the given fleet will remain in service, and 
unlike the above example excludes fuel taxes from the computation of the total social benefit, 
as taxes are transfer payments. 
The annual savings to each consumer shown in the above example may seem like a 
small amount, but the reader should recognize that the valuation of the cumulative lifetime 
benefit of this savings to owners is determined separately for passenger car and light truck 
fleets and then aggregated to show the net benefit across all light-duty vehicles – which is 
much more significant at the macro level.  Calculations of benefits realized in future years are 
adjusted for expected real growth in the price of gasoline, for the decline in the number of 
vehicles of a given model year that remain in service as they age, for the decrease in the 
number of miles (VMT) driven by those that stay in service, and for the percentage of 
refueling trips that occur for reasons other than a low reading on the gas gauge; a discount rate 
is also applied in the valuation of future benefits.  The agencies considered using this direct 
estimation approach to quantify the value of this benefit by model year, however the value of 
this benefit is implicitly captured in the separate measure of overall valuation of fuel savings, 
and therefore direct estimates of this benefit are not added to net benefits calculations. 
We note that there are other benefits resulting from the reduction in miles driven to 
and from fueling stations, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions – CO2 in 
particular, reductions in evaporative emissions from refuelings, and reduced wear on vehicles.  
However, estimates of the values of these benefits indicate that both are extremely minor in 
the context of the overall valuation of benefits associated with gains in vehicle driving range, 
so quantitative valuations of these additional benefits are not included within this analysis. 
It is important to note that manufacturers’ decisions regarding vehicles’ fuel tank sizes 
are integral to the realized value of this benefit.  In MY 2010, fuel tanks were sized such that 
average driving range of passenger cars was 410 miles and of light trucks was 430 miles.  At 
vehicle redesign, manufacturers typically redesign fuel tanks based on changes in vehicle 
design and the allowable space for the fuel tank.  At redesign, manufacturers consider driving 
range, cargo and passenger space (utility), mass targets, safety, and other factors.  As fuel 
economy improves, manufacturers may opt at the time of vehicle redesign to downsize 
vehicles’ fuel tanks as a mass-reduction strategy and to maintain a target maximum range 
consistent with previous models.  Downsizing the fuel tank offers the potential for moderate 
mass reductionnnn at a small cost savings.  It is also possible for manufacturers to reduce the 
effective size of their fuel tanks by changing the length of the fill tube, which does not require 
redesign of the tank itself.  In determining the maximum feasible amount of mass reduction 
and the cost curves developed for mass reduction, the agencies used an assumption that fuel 
tanks would be resized to maintain range.  If a manufacturer did not downsize the fuel tank to 
                                                 
nnn
 For example, for a vehicle with a 15 gallon fuel tank and a 400 mile range, increasing fuel economy by 50% 
and downsizing the fuel tank to maintain range would enable a mass reduction of approximately 32 pounds 
based on the reduction in the amount of fuel alone.  If the fuel tank was not downsized, the range of the vehicle 
would increase to 600 miles. 
Economic and Other Assumptions Used in the Agencies' Analysis 
4-61 
 
maintain range, it could incur higher costs for compliance than the agencies projections 
because the manufacturer may need to employ other higher cost technologies to achieve the 
small incremental change in fuel economy and GHG improvements attributed to the reduction 
in the mass of the fuel tank.  If manufacturers elect to reduce fuel tank size in response to 
improved fuel economy to maintain range, the value of the refueling time savings benefit will 
be reduced because the number of trips to the gasoline station would not be reduced as much 
as estimated.  Reductions to fuel tank size will not eliminate the value of the refueling time 
savings benefit, however, unless they are performed annually to maintain a constant range.  
Also, the reduced time for refueling and reduction in evaporative emissions would be 
unchanged.  The agencies believe that annual refreshes of fuel tank size during the years in-
between model redesigns are unlikely; therefore, while downsizing fuel tanks would decrease 
the realized value of the refueling time savings benefit, it would not eliminate it, assuming 
that fuel economy rises in those interim years. 
The agencies considered past trends to evaluate potential outcomes with regard to the 
refueling time savings benefit. Fuel tank sizes by  broad vehicle class has been nearly flat over 
the past 20 years, with average light truck fuel tank volume slightly decreasing in recent 
years, and average passenger car fuel tank volume slightly increasing in size in recent years.  
These changes, less a gallon change in average fuel tanks size over twenty years, are slight.  
Tank sizes for popular passenger cars and light trucks in recent model years typically 
allow for maximum driving ranges of between 300 and 500 miles.  In MY 2010, the average 
driving range for light trucks was approximately 430 miles, while the average driving range 
for cars was 410 miles, and the average range for the combined fleet was approximately 420 
miles (Figure 4-3).  This compares to average ranges of 390 miles (trucks), 360 miles (cars) 
and 370 miles (fleet) in MY 1990.  While the linear trend shows a small increase in range (5-
10%) over this time period, the factors discussed above preclude drawing simple conclusions 
about the relationship between increases in average fuel economy and changes in fuel tank 
size.  As an example – in MY 2010, greater proportional sales of I4 sedans were seen as 
compared to previous years.  Since I4 and V6 sedan typically share the fuel tank component, 
the 2009/2010 spike in range (corresponding to the dip in fuel consumption in the previous 
chart) may or may not be a lasting increase, depending on manufacturer’s redesign choices.

4.2.12 Discounting future benefits and costs    
Discounting future fuel savings and other benefits is intended to account for the 
reduction in their value to society when they are deferred until some future date, rather than 
received immediately.  The discount rate expresses the percent decline in the value of these 
benefits – as viewed from the current perspective – for each year they are deferred into the 
future.  In evaluating the benefits from alternative increases in fuel economy and GHG 
standards for MY 2017-2025 passenger cars and light trucks, EPA and NHTSA consider 
discount rates of both 3 and 7 percent per year.   
Three percent may be the appropriate rate for discounting future benefits from 
increased fuel economy and GHG standards because most or all of vehicle manufacturers’ 
costs for complying with improved fuel economy and GHG standards are likely to be 
reflected in higher sales prices for their new vehicle models.  By increasing sales prices for 
new cars and light trucks, GHG and CAFE regulations will thus primarily affect vehicle 
purchases and other private consumption decisions.   
Both economic theory and OMB guidance on discounting indicate that the future 
benefits and costs of regulations that mainly affect private consumption should be discounted 
at the consumption rate of time preference.61  OMB guidance indicates that savers appear to 
discount future consumption at an average real (that is, adjusted to remove the effect of 
inflation) rate of about 3 percent when they face little risk about its likely level, which makes 
it a reasonable estimate of the consumption rate of time preference.62  Thus EPA and 
NHTSA have employed the 3 percent rate to discount projected future benefits and costs 
resulting from improved fuel economy and GHG standards for MY 2017-2025 passenger cars 
and light trucks.   
Because there is some uncertainty about the extent to which vehicle manufacturers 
will be able to recover their costs for complying with improved fuel economy and GHG 
standards by increasing vehicle sales prices, however, the use of a higher percent discount rate 
may also be appropriate.  OMB guidance indicates that the real economy-wide opportunity 
cost of capital is the appropriate discount rate to apply to future benefits and costs when the 
primary effect of a regulation is “…to displace or alter the use of capital in the private sector,” 
and estimates that this rate currently averages about 7 percent.63  Thus the agencies estimate 
net present values using both 3 and 7 percent discount rates. 
One important exception to these values are the rates used to discount benefits from 
reducing CO2 emissions from the years in which reduced emissions occur, which span the 
lifetimes of model year 2017-2025 cars and light trucks, to their present values.  In order to 
ensure consistency in the derivation and use of the SCC estimates of the unit values of 
reducing CO2 emissions, the total benefits from reducing those emissions during each future 
year are discounted using the same rates that were used to derive the alternative values of 
reducing each ton of CO2 emissions (2.5, 3.0, and 5.0 percent).

Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-2 
 
Chapter 5:  Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other 
Flexibilities 
5.1 Air conditioning technologies and credits 
5.1.1 Overview  
Air conditioning (A/C) is virtually standard equipment in new cars and trucks, as over 
95% of the new cars and light trucks in the United States are equipped with mobile air 
conditioning (or MAC) systems.  Given the large penetration of A/C in today’s light duty 
vehicle fleet, its impact on the amount of energy consumed is significant.  In the 2012-2016 
Light-Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule, EPA structured the rule to allow vehicle manufacturers’ to 
generate credits for improved air conditioner systems in complying with the CO2 fleetwide 
average standards.  EPA is proposing to continue with and expand upon these provisions the 
result being that manufacturers could generate credits for improved performance of both 
direct (A/C leakage) and indirect (tailpipe emissions attributable to A/C use) A/C emissions.  
Through model years 2012-2016, the EPA expects that manufacturers will take 
advantage of the A/C credits offered (for reduced leakage and improved efficiency) in the 
previous rule in order to help come into compliance with the standards.  EPA estimated that 
there would be significant penetration of A/C technologies to gain credits, and this was 
reflected in the stringency of the standards.a  Consistent with the fleet definitions from 
Chapter 1 of the joint TSD, the base level of A/C technologies in 2008 forms the A/C 
“baseline”, and the A/C technologies projected to penetrate to the fleet in 2016 is referred to 
as the A/C “reference”.  For this 2017-2025 rule the EPA is proposing to maintain the 
crediting program starting from the baseline (MY 2008).  The credits should continue to the 
present rule since without them, a manufacturer utilizing credits in 2016 could suddenly find 
in 2017 that the stringency of the standards are artificially increased due to discontinued A/C 
credits.b  In this chapter, A/C credits are accounted from the baseline (though there are some 
changes to the credit program), while costs are accounted from the reference.  Any additional 
A/C credits projected for 2017-2025 are reflected in the stringency of the standards as 
described in Section III.C.1 of the proposed preamble.  EPA in coordination NHTSA is 
proposing for this 2017-2025 rule to allow manufacturers to include fuel consumption 
reductions related to improvements in A/C system efficiency (indirect) in their CAFE 
calculations.  In the 2012 to 2016 rule, EPA and NHTSA did not allow manufacturers to 
include reductions in fuel consumption resulting from A/C operation (indirect) in the CAFE 
                                                 
a
 NHTSA will also be referencing these efficiency improving A/C technologies in their rule, but they will be 
referred to as “fuel consumption improvements” instead of credits.  For the purpose of this document, the term 
“credit” can be considered synonymous with the phrase “fuel consumption improvement” wherever efficiency-
improving A/C technologies are discussed. 
b
 Put another way, the 2016 GHG standards would remain even if there were no new 2017-2025 standards and 
A/C credits would also continue.  Thus, if the AC credits were removed or significantly changed from these 
(perpetuated) post-2016 standards, the stringency of those standards would effectively be increased. 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities

calculations.  As was the case in the 2012 to 2016 rule, the agency is not proposing to provide 
credit for reductions in HFC leakage. A discussion of how this change will be implemented is 
provided in this chapter.      
A/C is different from the other technologies described in Chapter 3 of the joint TSD in 
several ways.  First, most of the technologies described earlier directly affect the efficiency of 
the engine, transmission, and vehicle systems.  As such, these systems are almost always 
active while the vehicle is moving down the road or being tested on a dynamometer for the 
fuel economy and emissions test drive cycles.  A/C, on the other hand, is a parasitic load on 
the engine that only burdens the engine when the vehicle occupants demand it.  Since it is not 
tested as a part of the fuel economy and emissions test drive cycles – with the exception of the 
SC03 cycle - it is referred to as an “off-cycle” effect.  There are many other off-cycle loads 
that can be switched on by the occupant that affect the engine; these include lights, wipers, 
stereo systems, electrical defroster/defogger, heated seats, power windows, etc.  However, 
these electrical loads individually amount to a very small effect on the engine (although 
together they can be significant).  The A/C system (by itself) adds a significant load on the 
engine, resulting in increased fuel consumption, or “indirect” CO2 emissions.  
There are two mechanisms by which A/C systems contribute to the emissions of 
greenhouse gases.  The first is through direct leakage of the refrigerant into the air.  The 
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant compound currently used in all recent model year 
vehicles is R-134a (also known as 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane, or HFC-134a).  Based on the 
higher global warming potential of HFCs, a small leakage of the refrigerant has a greater 
global warming impact than a similar amount of emissions of some other mobile source 
GHGs.  R-134a has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1,430.   This means that 1 gram of 
R-134a has the equivalent global warming potential of 1,430 grams of CO2 (which has a 
GWP of 1).   In order for the A/C system to take advantage of the refrigerant’s 
thermodynamic properties and to exchange heat properly, the system must be kept at high 
pressures even when not in operation.  Typical static pressures can range from 50-80 psi 
depending on the temperature, and during operation, these pressures can get to several 
hundred psi.  At these pressures leakage can occur through a variety of mechanisms.  The 
refrigerant can leak slowly through seals, gaskets, and even small failures in the containment 
of the refrigerant.  Through normal use, the rate of leakage may also increase due to wear on 
the system components.  Leakage may also increase more quickly through rapid component 
deterioration such as during vehicle accidents, maintenance or end-of-life vehicle scrappage 
(especially when refrigerant capture and recycling programs are less efficient).  Small 
amounts of leakage can also occur continuously even in extremely “leak-tight” systems by 
permeating through hose membranes and seals.  This last mechanism is not dissimilar to fuel 
permeation through porous fuel lines (and seals).  Manufacturers may be able to reduce these 
leakage emissions through the implementation of technologies/designs such as leak-tight, 
non-porous, durable components.  The global warming impact of leakage emissions also can 
be addressed by using alternative refrigerants, such as HFO-1234yf, R-744 (CO2), HFC-152a 
(R-152a), or other refrigerants under development with lower global warming potentials.  
Refrigerant emissions can also occur during maintenance and at the end of the vehicle’s life 
(as well as emissions during the initial charging of the system with refrigerant), and these 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-4 
 
emissions are already addressed by the CAA Title VI stratospheric ozone program, as 
described below.c    
The second mechanism by which vehicle A/C systems contribute to GHG emissions is 
through the consumption of additional fuel required to provide power to the A/C system and 
from carrying around the weight of the A/C system hardware year-round.  These indirect 
emissions result from the additional fuel which is required to provide power to the A/C 
system (and the additional fuel is converted into CO2 by the engine during combustion).  
These increased emissions due to A/C operation can be reduced by increasing the overall 
efficiency of the vehicle’s A/C system, as described below.  EPA does not plan to address 
modifications to the weight of the A/C system, since the incremental increase in CO2 
emissions and fuel consumption due to carrying the A/C system is directly measured during 
the normal federal test procedure, and is thus already accounted for in the CO2 tailpipe 
standard.     
EPA’s analysis from the MY 2012-2016 rule indicates that A/C-related indirect 
emissions represent about 3.9% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light 
trucks.  In this document, EPA will separate the discussion of these two categories of A/C-
related emissions because of the fundamental differences in the emission mechanisms and the 
methods of emission control.  Refrigerant leakage control is akin in many respects to past 
EPA fuel evaporation control programs (in that containment of a fluid is the key feature), 
while efficiency improvements are more similar to the vehicle-based control of CO2 using the 
technologies described in chapter 3 of the joint TSD in that emission reductions would be 
achieved through specific hardware and controls.   
 
5.1.2 Air Conditioner Leakage 
5.1.2.1 Impacts of Refrigerant Leakage on Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
There have been several studies in the literature which have attempted to quantify the 
emissions (and impact) of air conditioner HFC emissions from light duty vehicles. In this 
section, several of these studies are discussed.  These inventories and impacts form the basis 
for the air conditioner environmental credits, and in this proposal, we are using the same 
emissions inventory and analysis method for refrigerant leakage as we did in the 2012-2016 
rule as described in section 5.1.2.2.3.    
                                                 
c
 Even if A/C systems utilize a “low-GWP” refrigerant, such as HFO-1234yf (GWP = 4), emissions is still a 
concern.  First, as refrigerant leaks from the system, once the refrigerant level drops to 40 to 50 percent of its 
normal capacity, the operating efficiency of the system will degrade, resulting in an increase in fuel consumption 
due to A/C use, and an increase in indirect emissions, Second, if systems do leak refrigerant at an excessive rate, 
there is a higher probability that someone will unlawfully recharge the system with a cheaper, and higher-GWP 
refrigerant, resulting in increased direct emissions.

Based on measurements from 300 European vehicles (collected in 2002 and 2003), 
Schwarz and Harnisch estimate that the average HFC direct leakage rate from modern A/C 
systems was 53 g/yr.1  This corresponds to a leakage rate of 6.9% per year.  This was 
estimated by extracting the refrigerant from recruited vehicles and comparing the amount 
extracted to the amount originally filled (as per the vehicle specifications).  The fleet and size 
of vehicles differs from Europe and the United States, therefore it is conceivable that vehicles 
in the United States could have a different leakage rate.  The authors measured the average 
charge of refrigerant at initial fill to be about 747 grams (it is somewhat higher in the U.S. at 
770g), and that the smaller cars (684 gram charge) emitted less than the higher charge 
vehicles (883 gram charge).  Moreover, due to the climate differences, the A/C usage patterns 
also vary between the two continents, which may influence leakage rates.  
Vincent et al., from the California Air Resources Board estimated the in-use 
refrigerant leakage rate to be 80 g/yr.2  This is based on consumption of refrigerant in 
commercial fleets, surveys of vehicle owners and technicians.  The study assumed an average 
A/C charge size of 950 grams and a recharge rate of 1 in 16 years (lifetime).  The recharges 
occurred when the system was 52% empty and the fraction recovered at end-of-life was 8.5%.   
5.1.2.1.1 Emission Inventory 
The EPA publishes an inventory of greenhouse gases and sinks on an annual basis.  
The refrigerant emissions numbers that are used in the present analysis are from the Vintaging 
model, which is used to generate the emissions included in this EPA inventory source.  The 
HFC refrigerant emissions from light duty vehicle A/C systems was estimated to be 61.8 Tg 
CO2 equivalent in 2005 by the Vintaging model.3,d  In 2005, refrigerant leakage accounted for 
about 5.1% of total greenhouse gas emissions from light duty sources. From a vehicle 
standpoint, the Vintaging model assumes that 42% of the refrigerant emissions are due to 
direct leakage (or “regular” emissions), 49% for service and maintenance (or “irregular” 
emissions), and 9% occurs at disposal or end-of-life as shown in the following table.  These 
are based on assumptions of the average amount of chemical leaked by a vehicle every year, 
how much is lost during service of a vehicle (from professional service center and do-it-
yourself practices), and the amount lost at disposal.  These numbers vary somewhat over time 
based on the characteristics (e.g. average charge size and leakage rate) of each “vintage” of 
A/C system, assumptions of how new A/C systems enter the market, and the number of 
vehicles disposed of in any given year.

5.1.2.1 Alternative Refrigerants  
Leakage emissions can also be reduced with the use of refrigerants other than R-134a, 
which has a global warming potential (GWP) of 1430.  To address future GHG regulations in 
the Europe Union and the State of California, air conditioning systems which use alternative 
refrigerants  are under serious development, and have been demonstrated in prototypes by 
vehicle manufacturers and A/C component suppliers. The European Union has enacted 
regulations which require the use of refrigerants with a GWP less than 150.  Phase-in of these 
EU regulations began with new vehicle platforms in 2011, and will be completely phased-in 
for all vehicles by 2017.  Some of the alternative refrigerants under development by 
manufacturers and A/C component suppliers include HFO-1234yf, CO2, HFC-152a, and low-
GWP blends of existing refrigerants. The air conditioning component and refrigerant 
manufacturers, as well as automotive manufacturers, are actively studying the performance, 
efficiency, safety, and cost of these alternative refrigerants.  
HFO-1234yf, with a GWP of 4, is a leading candidate as an alternative to R-134a 
refrigerant.  For example, General Motors has selected HFO1234yf for use in certain model 
year 2013 vehicles.4  While the performance and efficiency of A/C systems using HFO-
1234yf can be equivalent to those using HFC-134a, the higher cost of implementing this 
refrigerant – estimated at $67 per vehicle in model year 2016 (see section 5.1.4) – is causing 
the industry to consider other solutions which are lower-cost. 
A so-called “natural refrigerant” under consideration is CO2, which has a GWP of 1.  
While this refrigerant is environmentally neutral from a GWP perspective (i.e. relative to a 
CO2 baseline), and is currently used in some commercial refrigeration units, its use in 
automotive applications is challenging due to the higher operating pressure of CO2 systems, 
where the peak pressure can be as high as 2000 PSI, compared to the peak pressure in HFC-
134a systems of around 450 PSI.  Several European auto manufacturers have successfully 
developed CO2 A/C systems, but none have been produced for use in new vehicles at this 
time.  An A/C system which uses CO2 is estimated to cost $139 to $209 more than an 
equivalent HFC-134a system; however, the cost of the refrigerant itself is expected to be 
considerably less than HFO-1234yf.5 
HFC-152a (1,1-difluoroethane) is a flammable refrigerant with a GWP of 120 and an 
ASHRAE flammability designation of Class 2.  Given the flammability of this refrigerant, we 
expect that manufacturers would either need to design their A/C systems with a secondary 
loop or with directed relief valves to mitigate safety concerns within the cabin area, and to 
comply with the use conditions at 40 CFR Part 82 Subpart G Appendix B.  With a secondary 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-7 
 
loop design, the evaporator is not located inside the passenger cabin area, but inside a chiller 
in an underhood location, where a secondary fluid (such as an ethylene glycol-water mixture) 
is circulated to transfer heat from the cabin to the chiller.  This approach requires additional 
system components (chiller, pump, reservoir, and plumbing for secondary loop), which adds 
an estimated 12 lbs. of mass to the vehicle.6  With the directed relief valve design, the 
refrigerant within the A/C system is vented and ducted to the atmosphere by opening high and 
low-side relief valves when a leak is detected.7  The advantage of the directed relief valve 
approach (relative to a secondary loop) is that fewer components are needed, potentially 
minimizing the mass and cost of the system. 
Other alternative refrigerants which may be used in the future may include low-GWP 
blends.  Recent studies have shown that the low-GWP refrigerant blends AC5 and AC6 from 
the chemical manufacturer Mexichem, have performance and efficiency characteristics which 
are similar to HFC-134a under high-load (maximum cooling) conditions, and slightly reduced 
performance and efficiency under low-load conditions.  These mildly-flammable (similar to 
HFO-1234yf) refrigerant blends, being comprised of several different refrigerant components, 
have zeotropic properties.  This means that the fraction of each component in the gas and 
liquid phases is not constant, and varies with temperature and pressure within the system.8  
Zeotropic behavior may result in mal-distribution of the refrigerant within the evaporator and 
condenser, which negatively affects system efficiency, especially at low loads.9  However, it 
is believed that optimization of evaporator and condenser design can improve the load-load 
efficiency.  These blends may be similar enough in performance and in their physical 
characteristics to HFC-134a and HFO-1234yf that they may be used in current production 
A/C systems designs with relatively minor modifications 
. 
We expect that stakeholders in the automotive A/C industry will continue to study and 
develop low-GWP refrigerant solutions in order to minimize the direct and indirect impact of 
A/C-related emissions.  With the statutory requirements for low-GWP refrigerants in the 
European Union, which began in model year 2011 for new vehicles designs, we expect that 
one or more of these low-GWP solutions will be available for at least 20% of the U.S. vehicle 
fleet by model year 2017, and that an additional 20% of the fleet can adopt the alternative 
refrigerant in each subsequent model year.  EPA expects that manufacturers would be 
changing over to alternative refrigerants at the time of complete vehicle redesign, which 
occurs about every 5 years, though in confidential meetings, some manufacturers/suppliers 
have informed EPA that it may be possible to modify the hardware for some alternative 
refrigerant systems between redesign periods.   
5.1.2.2 A/C Leakage Credit  
The level to which each technology can reduce leakage can be estimated using the 
SAE Surface Vehicle Standard J2727 – HFC-134a Mobile Air Conditioning System 
Refrigerant Emission Chart.  While this standard was developed for leakage of HFC-134a 
refrigerant, it is also applicable to the alternative refrigerant HFO-1234yf, and may be 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-8 
 
applicable to other low-GWP refrigerants as well.  To convert J2727 chart emission (leak) 
rates from HFC-134a to HFO-1234yf  leakage rates, the result is multiplied by the ratio of the 
molecular weights of the two refrigerants, or 114 divided by 102.   
The J2727 standard was developed by SAE and the cooperative industry and 
government IMAC (Improved Mobile Air Conditioning) program using industry experience, 
laboratory testing of components and systems, and field data to establish a method for 
calculating leakage.  With refrigerant leakage rates as low as 10 g/yr, it would be exceedingly 
difficult to measure such low levels in a test chamber (or shed).  Since the J2727 method has 
been correlated to “mini-shed”, or SAE J2763, results (where A/C components are tested for 
leakage in a small chamber, simulating real-world driving cycles), the EPA considers this 
method to be an appropriate surrogate for vehicle testing of leakage.10  It is also referenced by 
the California Air Resources Board in their Environmental Performance Label regulation and 
the State of Minnesota in their GHG reporting regulation.11,12   
5.1.2.2.1 Why Is EPA Relying on a Design-Based Approach to Quantify Leakage? 
As in the 2012-2016 rule, EPA will continue to use a design-based method for 
quantifying refrigerant leakage from A/C systems.  In the time since the 2012 rule was 
finalized, the Agency was not informed of any new approaches or methods for measuring 
actual refrigerant leak rates.  While EPA generally prefers performance testing for emissions, 
a feasible method for measuring refrigerant emissions accurately from a vehicle is not 
available, and we are proposing for MY 2017-2025 a continuation of the SAE J2727-based 
approach adopted in the 2012-2016 rule.  EPA believes that the SAE J2727 method, as 
discussed below, is an appropriate method for quantifying the expected yearly refrigerant 
leakage rate from A/C systems. 
5.1.2.2.2 How Would Leakage Credits Be Calculated? 
For model years 2017 through 2025, the A/C credit available to manufacturers will be 
calculated based on how much a particular vehicle’s annual leakage value is reduced 
compared to an average MY 2008 vehicle with baseline levels of A/C technology, and will be 
calculated using a method drawn directly from the updated SAE J2727 approach (for details 
on these updates, see 5.1.2.2.2.2).  By scoring the minimum leakage rate possible on the 
J2727 components enumerated in the rule (expressed as a measure of annual leakage), a 
manufacturer can generate the maximum A/C credit (on a gram per mile basis).  To avoid 
backsliding on leakage rates when using low-GWP refrigerants, where manufacturers could 
choose less costly sealing technologies and/or materials, EPA is proposing a disincentive 
credit for “high leak” on alternative refrigerant systems.  The maximum value for this high 
leak disincentive credit (or HiLeakDisincentive) is 1.8 g/mi for cars and 2.1 g/mi for trucks, 
with lower amounts possible for leakage rates between the minimum leakage score 
(MinScore) and the average impact (AvgImpact).  The terms used for calculating the A/C 
Leakage Credit as well as the HiLeakDisincentive are discussed later in this section. 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-9 
 
The A/C credit available to manufacturers will be calculated based on the reduction to 
a vehicle’s yearly leakage rate, using the following equation:    
Equation 5-1 Credit Equation 
A/C Leakage Credit = (MaxCredit) * [ 1 - (§86.166-12 Score / AvgImpacte) * 
(GWPRefrigerant / 1430)] -  HiLeakDisincentive 
where the HiLeakDisincentive is determined in accordance with one of the following three 
conditions: 
• HiLeakDisincentive = MaxHiLeakDisincentive, or 1.8 g/mi for cars and 2.1 
g/mi for trucks, if the Score > AvgImpact 
• HiLeakDisincentive = MaxHiLeakDisincentive * (Score – 
MinScore)/(AvgImpact – MinScore), if MinScore < Score < AvgImpact 
• HiLeakDisincentive = 0 g/mi, if Score < MinScore 
There are four significant terms to the credit equation.  Each is briefly summarized below, and 
is then explained more thoroughly in the following sections.  Please note that the values of 
many of these terms change depending on whether HFC-134a or an alternative refrigerant is 
used.  The values are shown in Table 5-2, and are documented in the following sections. 
• “MaxCredit” is a term for the maximum amount of credit entered into the equation 
before constraints are applied to terms. The maximum credits that could be generated 
by a manufacturer is limited by the choice of refrigerant and by assumptions regarding 
maximum achievable leakage reductions.  Some of these values may have changed 
since the 2012-2016 rule.   
• “Score” is the leakage score of the A/C system as measured according to the §86.166-
12 calculation in units of g/yr, where the minimum score which is deemed feasible is 
fixed. 
•  “AvgImpact” is a term which represents the annual average impact of A/C leakage. 
• “MinScore” is the lowest leak score that EPA projects is possible, when starting from 
a baseline, or AvgImpact, system.  The MinScore represents a 50% reduction in 
leakage from the baseline levels based on the feasibility analysis detailed below. 
• “GWPRefrigerant” is the global warming potential for direct radiative forcing of the 
refrigerant as defined by EPA (or IPCC).   
• “HiLeakDisincentive” is a term for the disincentive credit deducted for low-GWP 
alternative refrigerant systems which have a leakage rate greater than the minimum 
leakage score of 8.3 g/year for cars, and 10.4 g/year for trucks.  The maximum 
Disincentive is 1.8 g/mile for cars, and 2.1 g/mile for trucks. HiLieakDisincentive is

5.1.2.2.2.1 Max Credit Term 
In order to determine the maximum possible credit on a gram per mile basis, it was 
necessary to determine the projected real world HFC emissions per mile.  This calculation is 
done exactly the same as it was done for the 2012-2016 final rule.  Because HFC is a leakage 
type emission, it is largely disconnected from vehicle miles traveled (VMT).f  Consequently, 
the total HFC inventory (in 2016) was calculated, and then calculated the relevant VMT.  The 
quotient of these two terms is the HFC contribution per mile. 
 
Consistent with the methodology presented in the 2012-2016 rule, the HFC emission 
inventories were estimated from a number of existing data sources.  The per-vehicle per-year 
HFC emission of the current vehicle fleet was determined using averaged 2005 and 2006 
registration data from the Transportation Energy Databook (TEDB) and 2005 and 2006 
mobile HFC leakage estimates from the EPA Emissions and Sinks report described above.3,13  
The per-vehicle per-year emission rates were then adjusted to account for the new definitions 
of car and truck classes by increasing the car contribution proportionally by the percentage of 
former trucks that are reclassified as cars.g  This inventory calculation assumes that the 
leakage rates and charge sizes of future fleets (absent any standards) are equivalent to the fleet 
present in the 2005/2006 reference years.  Preliminary EPA analysis indicates that this may 
increasingly overstate the future HFC inventory, as charge sizes are decreasing, though more 
is discussed on this topic below.      
 
The per-vehicle per-year average emission rate was then scaled by the projected 
vehicle fleet in each future year (using the fleet predicted in the emissions analysis) to 
                                                 
f
 In short, leakage emissions occur even while the car is parked, so the connection to a gram/mile credit is not 
straightforward.  However, HFC emissions must be converted to a gram/mile basis in order to create a relevant 
credit. 
g
 Many of these “older” references still use the old definition of car and truck.  The new definitions do not apply 
until model year 2011.   
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities

estimate the HFC emission inventory if no further controls were enacted on the fleet.  After 
dividing the 2016 inventory by total predicted VMT in 2016, an average per mile HFC 
emission rate (“base rate”) was obtained.   
 
The base rate is an average in-use number, which includes both old vehicles with 
significant leakage, as well as newer vehicles with very little leakage.  The new vehicle 
leakage rate is discussed in section 5.1.2.3, while deterioration is discussed in section 5.1.2.5. 
 
• Max Credit with Conventional Refrigerant (HFC-134a) 
Two adjustments were made to the base rate in order to calculate the Maximum HFC 
credit with conventional refrigerant.  First, EPA has determined that 50% leakage 
prevention is the maximum potentially feasible prevention rate in the timeframe of this 
rule (see section 5.1.2.3).  Some leaks will occur and are expected, regardless of 
prevention efforts.  The accuracy of the J2727 approach (as expressed in §86.112), as 
a design based test, decreases as the amount of expected leakage diminishes.  50% of 
the base rate is therefore set as the maximum potential leakage credit for 
improvements to HFC leakage using conventional refrigerant. 
 
Second, EPA expects that improvements to conventional refrigerant systems will 
affect both leakage and service emissions, but will not affect end of life emissions.  
EPA expects that reductions in the leakage rate from A/C systems will result in fewer 
visits for maintenance and recharges.  This will have the side benefit of reducing the 
emissions leftover from can heels (leftover in the recharge cans) and the other releases 
that occur during maintenance.  However, as disposal/end of life emissions will be 
unaffected by the leakage improvements (and also are subject to control under the 
rules implementing Title VI of the CAA), the base rate was decreased by a further 9% 
(Table 5-1).   
 
• Max Credit with Alternative Refrigerant  
Emission reductions greater than 50% are possible with alternative refrigerants.  As an 
example, if a refrigerant with a GWP of 0 were used, it would be possible to eliminate 
all refrigerant GHG emissions.  In addition, for alternative refrigerants, the EPA 
believes that vehicles with reduced GWP refrigerants should get credit for end of life 
emission reductions.  Thus, the maximum credit with alternative refrigerant is about 
9% higher than twice the maximum leakage reduction.  
As discussed above, EPA recognizes that substituting a refrigerant with a significantly 
lower GWP will be a very effective way to reduce the impact of all forms of refrigerant 
emissions, including maintenance, accidents, and vehicle scrappage.     
The A/C Leakage Credits that will be available will be a function of the GWP of the 
alternative refrigerant as well as of leakage, with the largest credits being available for 
refrigerants with GWPs at or approaching a value of 1, while also maintaining a low leakage 
rate.  For a hypothetical alternative refrigerant with a GWP of 1 (e.g., CO2 as a refrigerant), 
effectively eliminating leakage as a GHG concern, our credit calculation method could result 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-12 
 
in maximum credits equal to total average emissions, or credits of 13.8 and 17.2 g/mi CO2eq 
for cars and trucks, respectively, as incorporated into the A/C Leakage Credit formula above 
as the "MaxCredit" term.  
A final adjustment was made to each credit to account for the difference between real-
world HFC emissions and test-cycle CO2 emissions.  It has been shown that the tests currently 
used for CAFE certification represents an approximately 20% gap from real world fuel 
consumption and the resulting CO2 emissions.14  Because the credits from direct a/c 
improvements are taken from a real world source, and are being traded for an increase in fuel 
consumption due to increased CO2 emissions, the credit was multiplied by 0.8 to maintain 
environmental neutrality (Table 5-3).

5.1.2.2.2.2 Section 86.166-12, implementing the J2727 Score Term  
The J2727 score is the SAE J2727 yearly leakage estimate of the A/C system as 
calculated according to the J2727 procedure.  In the time since the 2012-2016 Light-Duty 
GHG Rule, there have been several refinements to the J2727 procedure which EPA will 
propose to incorporate into the EPA regulations. First, a provision was made for system joints 
where 100 percent of the joints are leak test with helium and a mass-spectrometer leak 
detector.  If the joints pass this leak test, they can be considered to have a leakage factor 
equivalent to that of a seal washer, which is next to the lowest factor possible for system 
joints.  Second, a requirement was added to use SAE J2064 hose permeation test results in 
place of the discrete values for various hose material and construction types that was provided 
in previous versions of the J2727 test method.  By using the test chamber results for 
refrigerant permeation through hoses, a more representative leakage estimate for the overall 
system is achieved.  The minimum J2727 score for cars and trucks is a fixed value, and the 
section below describes the derivation of the minimum leakage scores that can be achieved 
using the J2727 procedure. 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-13 
 
To calculate a J2727 score and credit for the alternative refrigerant HFO-1234yf, all 
values relevant to the credit calculations, as well as the J2727 score, shall be adjusted to 
account for the higher molecular weight of this refrigerant.  In contrast to the studies 
discussed in section 5.1.2.5 which examines the HFC emission rate of the in-use fleet (which 
includes vehicles at all stages of life), the SAE J2727 estimates leakage from new vehicles.  In 
the development of J2727, two relevant studies were assessed to quantify new vehicle 
emission rates.  In the first study, measurements from relatively new (properly functioning 
and manufactured) Japanese-market vehicles were collected.  This study was based on 78 in-
use vehicles (56 single evap, 22 dual evap) from 7 Japanese auto makers driven in Tokyo and 
Nagoya from April, 2004 to December, 2005.  The study also measured a higher emissions 
level of 16 g/yr for 26 vehicles in a hotter climate (Okinawa).  This study indicated the 
leakage rate to be close to 8.6 g/yr for single evaporator systems and 13.3 g/yr for dual 
evaporator systems.15  A weighted (test) average gives 9.9 g/yr.  In the second study, 
emissions were measured on European-market vehicles up to seven years age driven from 
November, 2002 to January, 2003.16  The European vehicle emission rates were slightly 
higher than the Japanese fleet, but overall, they were consistent.  The average emission rate 
from this analysis is 17.0 g/yr with a standard deviation of 4.4 g/yr.  European vehicles, 
because they have smaller charge sizes, likely understate the leakage rate relative to the 
United States.  To these emission rates, the J2727 authors added a factor to account for 
occasional defective parts and/or improper assembly and to calibrate the result of the SAE 
J2727 calculation with the leakage measured in the vehicle and component leakage studies.     
We adjust this rate up slightly by a factor proportional to the average European 
refrigerant charge to the average United States charge (i.e. 770/747 from the Vintaging model 
and Schwarz studies respectively). The newer vehicle emission rate is thus 18 g/yr for the 
average newer vehicle emissions (average for car and truck).   
 
To derive the minimum score, the 18 gram per year rate was used as a ratio to convert 
the gram per mile emission impact into a new vehicle gram per year for the test.  The car or 
truck direct a/c emission factor (gram per mile) was divided by the average emission factor 
(gram per mile) and then multiplied by the new vehicle average leakage rate (gram per year) 
Equation 5-2 – J2727 Minimum Score 
J2727 Minimum Score = Car or truck average pre control emissions (gram per 
mile)/ Fleet average pre-control emissions (grams per mile) x New vehicle annual 
leakage rate (grams per year) x Minimum Fraction 
 
By applying this equation, the minimum J2727 score is fixed at 8.3 g/yr for cars and 
10.4 g/yr for trucks.  This corresponds to a total fleet average of 18 grams per year, with a 
maximum reduction fraction of 50%.   
 
The GWP Refrigerant term in Equation 1 allows for the accounting of refrigerants 
with lower GWP (so that this term can be as low as zero in the equation), which is why the 
same minimum score is kept regardless of refrigerant used.  It is technically feasible for the 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-14 
 
J2727 Minimum score to be less than the values presented in the table.  But this will usually 
require the use of an electric compressor (see below for technology description).  
5.1.2.2.2.3 AvgImpact Term 
AvgImpact is the average annual impact of A/C leakage, which is 16.6 and 20.7 g/yr 
for cars and trucks respectively.  This was derived using Equation 2, but by setting the 
minimum fraction to one. 
5.1.2.2.2.4 GWPRefrigerant Term 
This term is relates to the global warming potential (GWP) of the refrigerant as 
documented by EPA.  A full discussion of GWP and its derivation is too lengthy for this 
space, but can be found in many EPA documents.4c  This term is used to correct for 
refrigerants with global warming potentials that differ from HFC-134a.   
5.1.2.2.2.5 HiLeakDisincentive 
The EPA is proposing to add (compared to the 2012-2016 formula) a disincentive to 
the leakage credit formula for systems which use a low GWP refrigerant, but “backslide” on 
low leakage levels.  As stated above, low leakage levels provide an environmental benefit by 
maintaining the charge of the system.  This has two advantageous effects.  First, it preserves 
the efficiency of the system.  Reduced refrigerant charge levels can reduce overall efficiency, 
especially if the compressor starts “short-cycling”.  Also, since lubrication is combined with 
refrigerant, the shortage of lubrication can wear out the compressor and cause it to seize and 
malfunction.  CARB testing has shown that preserving the refrigerant charge level in an A/C 
system results in improved system efficiency.17 Second, by reducing the leak rate of the low 
GWP system, the probability that the new system will run out of charge will be minimized.  
When a system runs out of charge, vehicle owners can either drive without A/C, or have a 
professional recharge the system, or recharge the system themselves.  The latter are called 
“do-it-yourself-ers” (DIYers).  It is entirely possible that DIYers (and some repair shops) may 
refill the system with the old refrigerant, R-134a, in order to save on costs.  Due to the 
demand from the legacy fleet, refill canisters of R-134a must be available to the market for 
many years to come (so it will be available to DIYers).  It is highly probable that the cost of 
HFO-1234yf (for example) will exceed R-134a for the foreseeable future, therefore there is an 
economic incentive to “tamper” with the A/C system and refill with the older, cheaper 
refrigerant.  Since the thermodynamic properties of the two refrigerants are similar, HFO-
1234yf systems should function with R-134a, although with some reduced effectiveness, and 
in some systems may lead to long term damage.h  Unfortunately, the extent to which this will 
occur is impossible to predict.  EPA is proposing this disincentive credit in order to maintain 
low refrigerant leakage emissions and to reduce the potential for leakage of high GWP 
refrigerants from systems which have been improperly recharged by DIY-ers.  Thus, EPA

believes that there are real, but unquantifiable, benefits for a leakage disincentive credit, and 
we are proposing that this (Max)HiLeakDisincentive be 1.8 g/mi for cars and 2.1 g/mi for 
trucks.  The EPA believes that these numbers strike a balance in that it is a large enough 
incentive to maintain low leakage levels, but it is not too large as to diminish incentive to 
switch to an alternative refrigerant.   
5.1.2.2.3 Why are the credits different from the 2010 Technical Assessment Report? 
The 2010 Technical Assessment report employed a different methodology for 
calculating the HFC credit, which resulted in significantly fewer credits available for A/C 
leakage (approximately 40% less).  The TAR analysis decreased the average charge size and 
leakage assumed in its analysis of future model years as compared to the 2012-2016 final rule.  In 
the present rule, we maintain the 2012-2016 credit value.  EPA chose this approach for both 
technical and policy reasons.  
 Like any inventory, the refrigerant inventory produced by the Vintaging model has 
uncertainties associated with it.  This is especially true given that we do not know how many 
“high emitters” exist in the U.S. fleet.  A high emitter is a vehicle that rapidly leaks HFC, but is 
also continually recharged.  A typical light duty vehicle may require recharge approximately 
every seven years (see section 5.1.2.5).  However, the owner of a high emitter may continually 
charge their systems each summer, thereby increasing the overall average emissions of the fleet.  
In the 2009-2010 study of the leakage rates from 70 in-use heavy duty vehicles, the California Air 
Resources Board found a relatively high prevalence of high emitting vehicles.  Of the 70, 5 had 
leakage rates that were greater than one-half a charge per year, while seven additional vehicles 
had annualized leakage rates greater than one-quarter charge per year.i  These values could 
potentially be used to recalculate the HFC inventories from the TAR and recalculate the leakage 
credit.   
EPA considered the lower inventory discussed in the TAR as well as the CARB study 
when determining the leakage credit for this rule.  While there is ultimately a mass balance 
between HFC produced and HFC leaked, this balance is not closed on an annual basis, and is 
difficult to directly verify.  Given the counterbalancing factors, EPA made the policy decision to 
maintain continuity with the 2012-2016 FRM analysis, and is proposing to incorporate this level 
of the credit in the standard setting process.  A reduction in A/C credits (in 2017 compared to 
2016 for example) would artificially increase the stringency of the standard for those 
manufacturers who generated leakage (and alternative refrigerant) credits in 2016 as a means of 
compliance.  With little lead time, these manufacturers would need to add other technologies to 
their fleet in order to close the gap their compliance target created by a reduction in the maximum 
potential A/C credit.  Alternately, the stringency of the 2017 standards would have to be relaxed, 
and in some cases may even be less stringent than 2016 standards if this adjustment is made.  
Given the need for stability for the standards (and stringencies), EPA is “freezing” the credit 
assessment based on that presented in the 2012-2016 rule, and also presented again above.

 While the Vintaging model assumes an average annualized leakage rate of 18% + 43% at end of life, it assumes 
that the MAC unit only lasts 12 years.  Actual MACs, particularly those that are recharged, may last longer.

5.1.2.3 Technologies That Reduce Refrigerant Leakage and their Effectiveness 
In this section, the analysis used in the 2012-2016 rule is again applied to the baseline 
technology levels and the effectiveness for leakage-reducing technologies.  For the 2012-2016 
rule, EPA conducted an analysis to determine the historic leakage emission rate for motor 
vehicle A/C systems, and it was estimated in section 5.1.2.2.2.2 that the A/C systems in new 
vehicles would leak refrigerant at an average rate of 18 g/yr – a value which EPA believes 
represented the types of A/C components and technologies in use prior to MY 2007.  EPA 
believes, through utilization of the leakage-reducing technologies described below, that it will 
be possible for manufacturers to reduce refrigerant leakage 50%, relative to the 18 g/yr 
baseline level.18  EPA also believes that all of these leakage-reducing technologies are 
currently available, and that manufacturers will use these technologies to generate credits 
under provisions of the 2012-2016 rule, as well as under the proposed provisions of this rule.  
In describing the technologies below, only the relative effectiveness figures are 
presented, as the individual piece costs are not known.  The EPA only has costs of complete 
systems based on the literature, and the individual technologies are described below.   
5.1.2.3.1 Baseline Technologies 
The baseline technologies assumed for A/C systems which have an average annual 
leak rate of 18 g/yr are common to many mass-produced vehicles in the United States.  In 
these mass-produced vehicles, the need to maintain A/C system integrity (and the need to 
avoid the customer inconvenience of having their A/C system serviced due to loss of 
refrigerant) is often balanced against the cost of the individual A/C components.  For 
manufacturers seeking improved system reliabilty, components and technologies which 
reduce leakage (and possibly increased cost) are selected, whereas other manufacturers may 
choose to emphasize lower system cost over reliabilty, and choose components or 
technologies prone to increased leakage.  In EPA’s baseline scenario, the following 
assumptions were made concerning the definition of a baseline A/C system: 
− all flexible hose material is rubber, without leakage-reducing barriers or veneers, of 
approximately 650 mm in length for both the high and low pressure lines 
− all system fittings and connections are sealed with a single o-rings 
− the compressor shaft seal is a single-lip design 
− one access port each on the high and low pressure lines 
− two of the following components: pressure switch, pressure relief valves, or pressure 
transducer 
− one thermostatic expansion valve (TXV) 
The design assumptions of EPA baseline scenario are also similar to the sample 
worksheet included in SAE’s surface vehicle standard J2727 – (R) HFC-134a Mobile Air 
Conditioning System Refrigerant Emission Chart.10  In the J2727 emission chart, it is the 
baseline technologies which are assigned the highest leakage rates, and the inclusion of 
improved components and technologies in an A/C system will reduce this annual leakage rate, 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-17 
 
as a function of their effectiveness relative to the baseline.  EPA considers these ‘baseline’ 
technologies to be representative of recent model year vehicles, which, on average, can 
experience a refrigerant loss of 18 g/yr.  However, depending on the design of a particular 
vehicle’s A/C system (e.g. materials, length of flexible hoses, number of fittings and adaptor 
plates, etc.), it is possible to achieve a leakage score much higher (i.e. worse) than 18 g/yr.  
According to manufacturer data submitted to the State of Minnesota, 19% of 2009 model year 
vehicles have a J2727 refrigerant score greater than 18 g/yr, with the highest-scoring vehicle 
reporting a leakage rate of 30.1 g/yr.19   For the 2010 model year, the average J2727 leakage 
score reporting database was 14.0 g/yr for cars, and 14.8 g/yr for trucks, but this is simply the 
average result of all vehicles in the database, and does not reflect sales weighting of the 
leakage scores nor does it eliminate identical models (vehicles with different brands or 
nameplates, but identical with respect to the A/C system design and components) when 
calculating the average score.   
Here again, the 18g/yr baseline is maintained at the 2012-2016 rule levels for both 
technical and policy reasons.  As mentioned earlier, there is great uncertainty in the leakage 
emissions from vehicles.  The J2727 scoring system, which is calibrated to in-use emissions 
from properly functioning vehicles, does not include high emitters.  EPA considers J2727 to 
be a surrogate for in-use emissions, and not necessarily an accurate representation of real-
world emissions.  Thus to maintain continuity with 2016 standards (and credits), EPA is 
“freezing” the baseline assumption of leakage rate from the fleet.   
5.1.2.3.2 Flexible Hoses 
The flexible hoses on an automotive A/C system are needed to isolate the system from 
engine vibration and to allow for the engine to roll within its mounts as the vehicle accelerates 
and decelerates.  Since the compressor is typically mounted to the engine, the lines going to-
and-from the compressor (i.e. the suction and pressure lines) must be flexible, or unwanted 
vibration would be transferred to the body of the vehicle (or other components), and excessive 
strain on the lines would result.  It has been industry practice for many years to manufacture 
these hoses from rubber, which is relatively inexpensive and durable.  However, rubber hoses 
are not impermeable, and refrigerant gases will eventually migrate into the atmosphere.  To 
reduce permeation, two alternative hose material can be specified.  The first material, is 
known as a standard ‘veneer’ (or ‘barrier’) hose, where a polyamide (polymer) layer - which 
has lower permeability than rubber - is encased by a rubber hose.  The barrier hose is similar 
to a veneer hose, except that an additional layer of rubber is added inside the polyamide layer, 
creating three-layer hose (rubber-polyamide-rubber).  The second material is known as ‘ultra-
low permeation’, and can be used in a veneer or barrier hose design.  This ultra-low 
permeation hose is the most effective at reducing permeation, followed by the standard veneer 
or barrier hose.  Permeation is most prevalent during high pressure conditions, thus it is even 
more important that these low permeable hoses are employed on the high pressure side, more 
so than on the low pressure side.   
According to J2727, standard barrier veneer hoses have 25% the permeation rate of 
rubber hose, and ultra low permeable barrier veneer hoses have 10% the permeation rate (as 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-18 
 
compared to a standard baseline rubber hose of the same length and diameter). However, 
manufacturers will be required to use actual SAE J2064 hose permeation data, instead of the 
discrete values provided for various hose material and construction types in previous versions 
of the J2727 method.    
5.1.2.3.3 System Fittings and Connections 
Within an automotive A/C system and the various components it contains (e.g. 
expansion valves, hoses, rigid lines, compressors, accumulators, heat exchangers, etc.), it is 
necessary that there be an interface, or connection, between these components.  These 
interfaces may exist for design, manufacturing, assembly, or serviceability reasons, but all 
A/C systems have them to some degree, and each interface is a potential path for refrigerant 
leakage to the atmosphere.  In SAE J2727 emission chart, these interfaces are described as 
fittings and connections, and each type of fitting or connection type is assigned an emission 
value based on its leakage potential; with a single O-ring (the baseline technology) having the 
highest leak potential; and a metal gasket having the lowest.  In between these two extremes, 
a variety of sealing technologies, such as multiple o-rings, seal washers, and seal washers with 
o-rings, are available to manufacturers for the purpose of reducing leakage.  It is expected that 
manufacturers will choose from among these sealing technology options to create an A/C 
system which offers the best cost-vs-leakage rate trade-off for their products.  
The relative effectiveness of the fitting and connector technology is presented in Table 
5-4.  For example, the relative leakage factor of 125 for the baseline single O-ring is 125 
times more “leaky” than the best technology - the metal gasket.

5.1.2.3.4 Compressor Shaft Seal 
A major source of refrigerant leakage in automotive A/C systems is the compressor 
shaft seal.   This seal is needed to prevent pressurized refrigerant gasses from escaping the 
compressor housing.  As the load on the A/C system increases, so does the pressure, and the 
leakage past the seal increases as well.  In addition, with a belt-driven A/C compressor, a side 
load is placed on the compressor shaft by the belt, which can cause the shaft to deflect 
slightly.  The compressor shaft seal must have adequate flexibility to compensate for this 
deflection, or movement, of the compressor shaft to ensure that the high-pressure refrigerant 
does not leak past the seal lip and into the atmosphere.  When a compressor is static (not 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-19 
 
running), not only are the system pressures lower, the only side load on the compressor shaft 
is that from tension on the belt, and leakage past the compressor shaft is at a minimum.  
However, when the compressor is running, the system pressure is higher and the side load on 
the compressor shaft is higher (i.e. the side load is proportional to the power required to turn 
the compressor shaft) - both of which can increase refrigerant leakage past the compressor 
shaft seal.  It is estimated that the rate of refrigerant leakage when a compressor is running 
can be 20 times that of a static condition.20   Due to the higher leakage rate under running 
conditions, SAE J2727 assigns a higher level of impact to the compressor shaft seal.  In the 
example shown in the August 2008 version of the J2727 document, the compressor is 
responsible for 58% of the system refrigerant leakage, and of that 58%, over half of that 
leakage is due to the shaft seal alone (the remainder comes from compressor housing and 
adaptor plate seals).  To address refrigerant leakage past the compressor shaft, manufacturers 
can use multiple-lip seals in place of the single-lip seals.   
5.1.2.4 Technical Feasibility of Leakage-Reducing Technologies 
EPA believes that the leakage-reducing technologies discussed in the previous 
sections are available to manufacturers today, are relatively low in cost, and that their 
feasibility and effectiveness have been demonstrated by the SAE IMAC teams.  EPA also 
believes – as has been demonstrated in the J2727 calculations submitted by manufacturers to 
the State of Minnesota – that reductions in leakage from 18 g/yr to 9 g/yr are possible (e.g. the 
2009 Saturn Vue has a reported leakage score of 8.5 g/yr).  In addition to generating credit for 
reduced refrigerant leakage, some manufacturers are likely to, within the timeframe of this 
rulemaking, choose to introduce alternative refrigerant systems, such as HFO-1234yf. 
EPA also believes that the alternative refrigerant HFO1234yf will be more 
commonplace within the timeframe of this rule.  EPA projects that because of the significant 
credit potential from alternative refrigerants, that the new vehicle fleet will completely switch 
to the new refrigerant by model year 2021.  More detailed discussion of this can be found in 
Section III of the Preamble.   
5.1.2.5 Leakage Controls in A/C Systems  
In order to determine the cost savings from the improvements to the leakage system, it 
may be necessary to project the point at which the vehicle will require servicing and an 
additional refrigerant charge.    
There are two mechanisms of leakage that are modeled: the “normal” leakage that 
results in annual refrigerant loss, and the “avoidable” leakage which results in total refrigerant 
loss due to failure of the A/C components (e.g. evaporator, condenser, or compressor).  This 
analysis is developed to help us estimate the costs of the A/C leakage reductions.  It is 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-20 
 
especially needed to determine the period over which the discounted cost savings should be 
applied.j   
Normal refrigerant leakage occurs throughout all components of the A/C system.  
Hoses, fittings, compressors, etc all wear with age and exposure to heat (temperature 
changes), vibration, and the elements.  It is assumed that the system leakage rates decrease 
(proportionally) as the base leakage rates are decreased with the use of improved parts and 
components.  The base leakage rate is modeled as a linear function, such that the (new 
vehicle) leakage rate is 18 g/yr at age zero and 59 g/yr at the “average” age of 5 years old.  
The 18 gram leakage rate for new vehicles has been documented in section 5.1.2.2.2.2, while 
the 59 gram mid-life leakage rate is drawn from the Vintaging model and is documented 
below. 
The Vintaging model assumes a constant leakage + servicing emission rate of 18% per 
year for modern vehicles running with HFC-134a refrigerant.  As the emission rates do not 
change by age in vintaging, the emission rate is the average rate of loss over the vehicle’s life.   
 
 Applying the percentages in Table 5-1, this corresponds to a leakage rate of 7.6% (59 
grams) per year and a servicing loss rate of 8.8% (68 grams) per year averaged over the 
vehicle’s life. The model assumes an average refrigerant charge of 770 grams for vehicles 
sold in 2002 or later and does not currently assume that these charge sizes will change in the 
future; however, the model may be updated as new information becomes available. The 
resulting vehicle emission rates are presented in Table 5-5.

 Air conditioning leakage controls are the only technology in this rule that have an assumed 
deterioration that affects the effectiveness of the technology.  This is partly because sufficient data is 
not available for many of the technologies in chapter 3 of the TSD.  More important, it is not expected 
that deterioration of powertrain technologies will lead to emissions increases on the scale of those seen 
when criteria pollutant technologies deteriorate.  The deterioration from the latter can increase 
emissions by factors of 10 or even 100 or more.  Similarly, air conditioning leakage technologies can 
and do deteriorate, contributing to significantly higher emissions over time.  For this reason, a 
deterioration model is proposed below.  This model only applies for leakage, and not for indirect CO2 
(tailpipe) emissions due to A/C.  For the latter, a partly functioning system may lead to somewhat 
higher emissions, but when it finally fails, it is one of the few technologies where the emissions are no 
longer relevant,  i.e. an A/C system that no longer functions no longer emits indirect emissions.   
 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-21 
 
The average leakage emissions rate of 59-68 g/yr is higher with Schwarz’s European1 
study and lower than CARB’s study,2 and thus is within the range of results in the literature. 
This model is presented in Figure 5-1 with the assumption that the average vehicle 
(A/C system) last about 10 years.  Technically, the assumption is that the A/C system lasts 10 
years and not the vehicle per se.  Inherent in this assumption is that the vehicle owner will not 
repair the A/C system on an older vehicle due to the expensive nature of most A/C repairs late 
in life relative to the value of the vehicle.  It is also assumed for the analysis in this section 
that the refrigerant requires a recharge when the state of charge reaches 50%.  This 
deterioration/leakage model approach can be used to estimate the cost of maintenance savings 
due to low leak technologies (from refills) as well as the benefits of leakage controls, though 
we have not accounted for maintenance savings or expenses in this rule.  
 
Figure 5-1  Deterioration Rate of Refrigerant Leakage 
Figure 5-2 shows how the leakage rates vary with age as the initial leakage rates are 
decreased to meet new standards (with improved components and parts).  The deterioration 
lines of the lower leakage rates were determined by applying the appropriate ratio to the 17 
g/yr base deterioration rate.  Figure 5-3 shows the refrigerant remaining, which includes a line 
indicating when a recharge is required (50% charge remaining out of an initial charge of 
770g).  So a typical vehicle meeting a leakage score of 8.5 g/yr (new) will not require a 
recharge until it is about 12 years old.

5.1.2.6 Other Benefits of improving A/C Leakage Performance 
The EPA is assuming that a reduction in leakage emissions from new vehicles will 
also improve the leakage over the lifetime of the vehicle.  There is ample evidence to show 
that A/C systems that leak more also have other problems that occur (especially with the 
compressor) due to the lack of oil circulating in the system.  Thus, it is expected that an A/C 
system which utilizes leak-reducing components and technologies should, on average, last 
longer than one which does not.   
A European study conducted in 2001 (by Schwarz) found that the condenser is the 
component most likely to fail and result in a total leak.21  The study also found that 
compressor component was most likely the culprit when other malfunctions were present 
(other than total loss).  A more recent (and larger) study found that condensers required 
replacement at half the rate of a compressor (10% vs 19% of the entire part replacement rate), 
and that evaporators and accumulators failed more often.16   The same study also found that 
many of the repairs occurred when the vehicles were aged 5-10 years.  Both these studies 
indicate that the condenser and compressor are among the major causes of failure in an A/C 
system.  Leakage reductions in the system are expected to greatly reduce the incidence of 
compressor repair, since one of the main root causes of compressor failure is a shortage of 
lubricating oil, which originates from a shortage of refrigerant flowing through the system 
(and it is a refrigerant-oil mixture which carries lubricating oil to the compressor).22 
Monitoring of refrigerant volume throughout the life of the A/C system may provide 
an opportunity to circumvent some previously described failures specifically related to 
refrigerant loss.  Similar to approaches used today by the engine on-board diagnostic systems 
(OBD) to monitor engine emissions, a monitoring system that informed the vehicle operator 
of a low refrigerant level could potentially result in significant reductions in A/C refrigerant 
emissions due to component failure(s) by creating an opportunity for early repair actions. 
While most A/C systems contain sensors capable of detecting the low refrigerant pressures 
which result from significant refrigerant loss, these systems are generally not designed to 
inform the vehicle operator of the refrigerant loss, and that further operation of the unrepaired 
system can result in additional component damage (e.g. compressor failure). Electronic 
monitoring of the refrigerant may be achieved by using a combination of existing A/C system 
sensors and new software designed to detect refrigerant loss before it progresses to a level 
where component failure is likely to occur.       
EPA requested comment in the 2012-2016 NPRM on allowing additional leakage 
credits for systems that monitor the leak levels, especially where manufacturers are willing to 
warrant such systems.  Presently, the EPA is not aware if any such technology exists to 
accurately monitor refrigerant levels, as the technical challenges are high.  As a result, there 
were no manufacturers who expressed interest in this credit, and the EPA did not finalize such 
credits.  For this 2017-2025 NPRM, EPA is again requesting comments on allowing these 
credits again, in the hopes of encouraging innovative technologies to monitor leakage levels.

5.1.3 CO2 Emissions and Fuel Consumption due to Air Conditioners 
As stated above, for model years 2012 to 2016, EPA provided credits for the use of 
A/C technologies that improve efficiency and achieve reductions in indirect CO2 emissions 
related to A/C use.  These credits were not previously applicable to the CAFE program fuel 
economy calculations.  For this proposal, the agencies are proposing that the A/C indirect 
credits be applicable to both the greenhouse gas and fuel economy calculations. 
5.1.3.1 Impact of Air Conditioning Use on Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions 
Three studies have been performed in recent years which estimate the impact of A/C 
use on the fuel consumption of motor vehicles in the United States.  In the first study, the 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Office of Atmospheric Programs 
(OAP) within EPA have performed a series of A/C related fuel use studies.23,24  The energy 
needed to operate the A/C compressor under a range of load and ambient conditions was 
based on testing performed by Delphi, an A/C system supplier.  They used a vehicle 
simulation model, ADVISOR, to convert these loads to fuel use over the EPA’s FTP test 
cycle.  They developed a personal “thermal comfort”-based model to predict the percentage of 
drivers which will turn on their A/C systems under various ambient conditions.  Overall, 
NREL estimated A/C use to represent 5.5% of car and light truck fuel consumption in the

In the second study, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) estimated the impact 
of A/C use on fuel consumption as part of their GHG emission rulemaking.25  The primary 
technical analysis utilized by ARB is summarized in a report published by NESCCAF for 
ARB.  The bulk of the technical work was performed by two contractors: AVL Powertrain 
Engineering and Meszler Engineering Services.  This work is founded on that performed by 
NREL-OAP.  Meszler used the same Delphi testing to estimate the load of the A/C 
compressor at typical ambient conditions.  The impact of this load on onroad fuel 
consumption was estimated using a vehicle simulation model developed by AVL - the 
CRUISE model - which is more sophisticated than ADVISOR. These estimates were made 
for both the EPA FTP and HFET test cycles.  (This is the combination of test cycle results 
used to determine compliance with NHTSA’s current CAFE standards.)  NREL’s thermal 
comfort model was used to predict A/C system use in various states and seasons.   
The NESCCAF results were taken from Table 3-1 of their report and are summarized 
in Table 5-6.26

NESCCAF estimated that nationwide, the average impact of A/C use on vehicle fuel 
consumption ranged from 4.6% for a large truck or SUV, to 5.9% for a minivan.  The total 
CO2 emissions were determined using a 55%/45% weighting of CO2 emissions from EPA 
FTP and HFET tests plus A/C fuel use (hereafter referred to simply as FTP/HFET).  For the 
purposes of this analysis of A/C system fuel use, the percentage of CO2 emissions and fuel 
use are equivalent, since the type of fuel being used is always gasoline.k  
In the 2012-2016 rule, there was a third analysis presented along with a thorough 
comparison of these studies.  While not repeated here, it was estimated that the impact of A/C 
on onroad fuel consumption was 3.9% based on a combination of the results from these 
studies.  This resulted in an average impact of 14.3g/mi (independent of car or truck type) and 
hence a maximum of 5.7 g/mi credit, identical for car and truck (based on a 40% 
improvement feasibility).  For this rule, EPA has conducted a new analysis, which supports 
the results achieved in the 2012-2016 final rule, though there is now a distinction made 
between cars and trucks as it relates to A/C efficiency impacts (and credits).     
5.1.3.2 Updated Analysis of Efficiency Impacts 
In the Light-Duty GHG final rule for model years 2012 through  2016, EPA estimated 
that the average CO2 emission increase due to A/C use would be 14.3 g/mi, as mentioned 
earlier, taking into account both manual and automatic climate control systems with market 
penetrations of 62% and 38%, respectively.  For this study of the A/C compressor load impact 
on vehicle fuel economy, EPA relied on comparisons of measured fuel economy over two 
warmed up bags (or phases) of the FTP test (without A/C operating) and the SC03 test (A/C 
emissions test).  EPA had based its estimates on testing of over 600 production vehicles.  
These test results were combined with the Phoenix study, where the A/C compressor on-time 
was estimated to be 23.9% for manual climate control systems and 35% for automatic climate 
control systems.  For more technical details, one can refer to the Regulatory Impact Analysis 
for the model year 2012 to 2016 final rule. 
For this proposed rule for model years 2017 through 2025, EPA has developed a more 
robust and systematic method of estimating vehicle CO2 emissions related to A/C usage.  This 
method is based on a sophisticated, newly-developed EPA vehicle simulation tool.  The next 
few paragraphs provide an overview of the vehicle simulation tool and describe how this 
approach improves on the earlier analysis.  More detailed descriptions about the vehicle 
simulation tool and its use for the A/C indirect impact analysis are in Chapter 2 of the EPA 
Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis.

 Because NESCCAF estimated A/C fuel use nationwide, while ARB focused on that in California, the 
NESCCAF and EPA methodologies and results are compared below.

Over the past year, EPA has developed full vehicle simulation capabilities in order to 
support regulations and vehicle compliance by quantifying the effectiveness of different 
technologies with scientific rigor over a wide range of engine and vehicle operating 
conditions.  This in-house simulation tool has been developed for modeling a wide variety of 
light, medium, and heavy duty vehicle applications over various driving cycles.  In order to 
ensure transparency of the models and free public access, EPA has developed the tool in 
MATLAB/Simulink environment with the completely open source code.  To support these 
simulation capabilities in part, EPA is upgrading its testing infrastructure (such as engine test 
cells, vehicle dynamometers, Portable Emissions Measurement Systems, and a battery 
laboratory) at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  
This testing infrastructure provides necessary data to calibrate and validate vehicle 
simulations, such as engine fuel maps, engine torque maps, vehicle aerodynamic parameters, 
battery, electrical component parameters, etc. 
EPA’s first application of the vehicle simulation tool was for purposes of heavy-duty 
vehicle compliance and certification.  For the model years 2014 to 2018 final rule for medium 
and heavy duty trucks, EPA created the “Greenhouse gas Emissions Model” (GEM), which is 
used both to assess Class 2b-8 vocational vehicle and Class 7/8 combination tractor GHG 
emissions and fuel efficiency and to demonstrate compliance with the vocational vehicle and 
combination tractor standards, see 40 CFR sections 1037.520 and 1037.810. This GEM 
documentation is also currently in publication.27 
For light-duty vehicles, EPA has developed a conventional (non-hybrid) vehicle 
simulation tool and used it to estimate indirect A/C CO2 emissions.  These estimates are used, 
in turn, to quantify the maximum amount of indirect A/C credit (i.e. the maximum credit 
potential).  As mentioned previously, the tool is based on MATLAB/Simulink and is a 
forward-looking full vehicle model that uses the same physical principles as other 
commercially available vehicle simulation tools (e.g. Autonomie, AVL-CRUISE, GT-Drive, 
etc.) to derive the governing equations.  These governing equations describe steady-state and 
transient behaviors of each of electrical, engine, transmission, driveline, and vehicle systems, 
and they are integrated together to provide overall system behavior during transient conditions 
as well as steady-state operations.  Chapter 2 of the Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis 
provides more details on this light-duty vehicle simulation tool used for estimating indirect 
A/C impact on fuel consumption. 
In the light-duty vehicle simulation tool, there are four key system elements that 
describe the overall vehicle dynamics behavior and the corresponding fuel efficiency: 
electrical, engine, transmission, and vehicle.  The electrical system model consists of parasitic 
electrical load and A/C blower fan, both of which were assumed to be constant.  The engine 
system model is comprised of engine torque and fueling maps.  For estimating indirect A/C 
impact on fuel consumption increase, two engine maps were used: baseline and EGR boost 
engines.  These engine maps were obtained by reverse-engineering the vehicle simulation 
results provided by Ricardo Inc.  For the transmission system, a Dual-Clutch Transmission 
(DCT) model was created and used along with the gear ratios and shifting schedules used for 
the earlier Ricardo simulation work.  For the vehicle system, four vehicles were modeled: 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-27 
 
small, mid, large size passenger vehicles, and a light-duty pick-up truck.  The transient 
behavior and thermodynamic properties of the A/C system was not explicitly simulated, in 
favor of a simpler approach of capturing the compressor load based on national average 
ambient conditions.  We believe this simplification is justified since the goal is to capture the 
behavior on the average of a fleet of vehicles (not the behavior of an individual make or 
model). 
In order to properly represent average load values to the engine caused by various A/C 
compressors and vehicle types, EPA has adopted power consumption curves of A/C systems, 
published by an A/C equipment supplier, Delphi.28,29  Also, in an effort to characterize an 
average A/C compressor load in the presence of widely varying environmental conditions in 
the United States, EPA has adopted data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 
(NREL) to estimate environmental conditions associated with typical vehicle A/C 
usage.30,31,32  Based on the NREL data, EPA selected an A/C power consumption curve as a 
function of engine speed that was acquired by Delphi at 27°C and 60% relative humidity as a 
representative average condition.  This power consumption curve data was taken from a fixed 
displacement compressor with a displacement volume of 210 cc.  Thus, the curve includes the 
effect of compressor cycling as well as non-summer defrost/defog usage.  In order to associate 
each vehicle type with the appropriate A/C compressor displacement, EPA scaled the curve 
based on the displacement volume ratio.  For determining indirect A/C impact on fuel 
consumption increase, EPA estimated A/C compressor sizes of 120 cc, 140 cc, 160 cc, and 
190 cc for small, medium, large passenger vehicles, and light-duty pick-up truck, respectively.  
By applying the displacement volume ratios to the 210 cc power consumption curve, EPA 
created A/C load curves for four vehicle types, as shown in Figure 5-4. 
 
Figure 5-4  Representative A/C Compressor Load Curves 
With these A/C compressor load curves, EPA ran full vehicle simulations based on the 
following matrix.  In this matrix, the baseline engine represents a typical Spark-Ignition (SI), 
Port-Fuel Injection (PFI), Naturally-Aspirated (NA) engine equipped with a Variable Value

Actuation (VVA) technology.  In this technology, the valve timing (both intake and exhaust) 
is continuously varied over a wide range of engine operating conditions in order to result in 
optimal engine breathing efficiency.  On the other hand, the EGR boost engine uses 
turbocharging and cooled EGR to increase engine’s Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) 
level while managing combustion and exhaust temperatures.  This engine usually has a peak 
BMEP of 25 to 30 bar, which supports significant downsizing (e.g. about 50%) compared to 
the baseline engines.  Table 5-7 provides simulation results over SC03 driving cycle with an 
EGR boost engine for various vehicle classes.

EPA ran the SC03 cycle simulations instead of FTP/Highway combined cycle 
simulations so that the simulation results would represent the actual A/C cycle test.  EPA also 
assumed the EGR boost engine during vehicle simulations because EGR boost engine better 
represents engine technology more likely to be implemented in model years 2017 to 2025 and 
because the A/C impact on CO2 increase in the EGR boost engine is similar to that in the 
baseline engine as shown in Table 5-7 and Table 5-8.  Details of this analysis which showed 
impact of A/C usage on fuel consumption is independent of engine technology are provided in 
the next section.  Moreover, EPA assumed 38% of a market penetration for automatic climate 
control systems as well as 23.9% and 35.0% of A/C on-time for manual and automatic climate 
control systems, respectively.  These are the same assumptions made in the 2012-2016 rule.33  
In order to come up with overall impact of A/C usage on CO2 emissions for passenger cars, 
the simulation results for cars shown in Table 5-7 were sales-weighted for each year from 
2017 to 2025.  For the end result, the impact of A/C usage was estimated at 11.9 CO2 g/mile 
for cars and 17.2 CO2 g/mile for trucks.  This corresponds to an impact of approximately 14.0 
CO2 g/mile for the (2012) fleet, which is comparable to the 2012-2016 final rule result, but 
still lower than the two studies by NREL and NESCCAF cited above. 
5.1.3.2.1 Effect of Engine Technology on Fuel Consumption by A/C System 
In order to continue to maintain the credit levels from the 2012-2016 rule, EPA had to 
first demonstrate that the fuel economy and CO2 emissions due to A/C was relatively 
insensitive to the engine technologies that may be expected to be prevalent in the future.  If 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-29 
 
for example, more efficient engines are able to run the A/C system more efficiently such that 
the incrememental increase in emissions due to A/C decreased compared to the base engines, 
then credits for the same A/C technologies must decrease over time as engines become more 
efficient.   This would correspond to a decrease in credits proportional (or multiplicative) to 
the increase in efficiency of the engine.  Conversely, if the incremental increase in emissions 
due to A/C remained relatively constant, then the credits available for A/C efficiency should 
also remain stable.  This would correspond to the credits (A/C impact) being additive to the 
base emissions rate, thus being independent of engine efficiency).  The EPA based the 
hypothesis on the latter assumption.   
In order to prove out this hypothesis, EPA carried out vehicle simulations for several 
cases, including two engine technologies: baseline and EGR boost engines (a surrogate for a 
future advanced efficient engine).  Table 5-8 shows the vehicle simulation results of CO2 
emissions over the SC03 driving cycle when baseline engines are used, as opposed to the 
advanced EGR boost engines.  By comparing the values of CO2 increase with A/C on in Table 
5-7 and Table 5-8, it is evident that the impact of A/C usage on fuel consumption is not very 
dependent on the engine technologies.  In fact, the difference in the CO2 increase with A/C on 
(2nd row in table) between the emissions from the baseline and EGR boost engines is less than 
10% for all vehicle classes.

Figure 5-5 depicts zoomed-in BSFC maps for baseline and EGR boost engines.  The 
circles on these maps represent average operating conditions of the engines over the FTP 
(city) drive cycle.  The blue circle represents a simulated average operating condition without 
A/C while the red circle represents an average operating condition with A/C.  As can be seen 
in the figure, the engines operate at higher load levels when the A/C is on.

Baseline and EGR Boost Engines 
For the baseline engine case, the engine efficiency improves significantly (375 g/kW-h 
to almost 330 g/kW-h) as it moves along the BSFC surface, whereas the improvement is 
much less for the EGR boost engine as it moves from approximately 250 g/kW-h to 240 
g/kW-h.  However, the large improvement in engine efficiency for the baseline engine is 
offset by the fact that the engine itself is less efficient than the EGR boost engine.  
Conversely, the small efficiency improvement for the EGR boost engine is compensated by 
the fact that the engine is much more efficient than the baseline engine.  As a result, the CO2 
increase seen by both engines due to A/C usage becomes similar between the two different 
technologies.  This result allows us to approximate the A/C impact on vehicle fuel 
consumption as an additive effect rather than a multiplicative effect since it is independent of 
engine technologies.  For the same reason, it also means that A/C credits for a given 
technology can remain constant over time, which will greatly simplify the progression of 
future credits.l

 It also means that the last row in the above two tables are a bit misleading as A/C impact should not be 
quantified as a fraction of the total emissions, but rather an additive increment.  The numbers are left onto the 
tables for comparison purposes to studies in the literature that use this convention.

5.1.3.3 Technologies That Improve Efficiency of Air Conditioning and Their 
Effectiveness 
Most of the excess load on the engine comes from the compressor, which pumps the 
refrigerant around the system loop.  Significant additional load on the engine may also come 
from electrical or hydraulic fan units used for heat exchange across the condenser and 
radiator.  The controls that EPA and NHTSA believe manufacturers would use to generate 
credits for improved A/C efficiency and to improve fuel efficiency in the CAFE program 
through the use of an adjustment in calculated fuel economy would focus primarily, but not 
exclusively, on the compressor, electric motor controls, and system controls which reduce 
load on the A/C system (e.g. reduced ‘reheat’ of the cooled air and increased of use 
recirculated cabin air).  EPA and NHTSA are proposing a program that will result in 
improved efficiency of the A/C system (without sacrificing passenger comfort) while 
improving the fuel efficiency of the vehicle, which has a direct impact on CO2 emissions.   
The cooperative IMAC program described above has demonstrated that average A/C 
efficiency can be improved by 36.4% (compared to an average MY 2008 baseline A/C 
system), when utilizing “best-of-best” technologies.34  EPA and NHTSA consider a baseline 
A/C system contains the following components and technologies; internally-controlled fixed 
displacement compressor (in which  the compressor clutch is controlled based on ‘internal’ 
system parameters, such as head pressure, suction pressure, and/or evaporator outlet 
temperature); blower and fan motor controls which create waste heat (energy) when running 
at lower speeds; thermostatic expansion valves; standard efficiency evaporators and 
condensers; and systems which circulate compressor oil throughout the A/C system.  These 
baseline systems are also extraordinarily wasteful in their energy consumption because they 
add heat to the cooled air out of the evaporator in order to control the temperature inside the 
passenger compartment.  Moreover, many systems default to a fresh air setting, which brings 
hot outside air into the cabin, rather than recirculating the already-cooled air within the cabin.   
The IMAC program indicates that improvements can be accomplished by a number of 
methods related only to the A/C system components and their controls including: improved 
component efficiency, improved refrigerant cycle controls, and reduced reheat of the cooled 
air.  The program EPA and NHTSA are proposing will encourage the reduction of A/C CO2 
emissions from cars and trucks by up to 42% from current baseline levels through a CO2 
credit and fuel economy improvement system.  EPA and NHTSA believe that the component 
efficiency improvements demonstrated in the IMAC program, combined with improvements 
in the control of the supporting mechanical and electrical devices (i.e. engine speeds and 
electrical heat exchanger fans), can go beyond the IMAC levels and achieve a total efficiency 
improvement of 42% through incremental improvements beyond that shown in the study due 
to the long lead time before 2017. The following sections describe the technologies the 
agencies believe manufacturers can use to attain these efficiency improvements. 
Based on the new vehicle simulation research conducted by the EPA described above, 
the EPA believes that the impact of A/C on average CO2 emissions amounts to 11.9 CO2 
g/mile for cars and 17.2 CO2 g/mile for trucks (0.001339 / 0.001935 gallons of gasoline per 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-32 
 
mile car/truck improvement) and that these results are relatively insensitive to the engine and 
transmission efficiency improvements expected to be seen during the rule timeframe.  A 42% 
improvement on this emissions rate leads to the maximum credit opportunity of 5.0 g CO2/mi 
for cars and 7.2 g CO2/mi for trucks (-0.000563 / -0.000810 gallons per mile car/truck 
improvement).  This compares to the 5.7 g/mi (identical for cars and trucks) finalized in the 
2012-2016 final rule.  When cars and trucks are combined, the new final rule maximum 
credits are consistent (on a fleet level) with those finalized in the previous rule, though for 
cars the credits are now somewhat diminished and for trucks increased.  The agencies believe 
that the modification of these credits for this rule is justified given the simulation work 
conducted, which shows that A/C emissions tends to be larger for the larger vehicles (and 
trucks tend to be larger than passenger cars).    
5.1.3.3.1 Reduced Reheat Using a Externally-Controlled, Variable-Displacement 
Compressor 
The term ‘external control’ of a variable-displacement compressor is defined as a 
mechanism or control strategy where the displacement of the compressor adjusted 
electronically, based on the temperature setpoint and/or cooling demand of the A/C system 
control settings inside the passenger compartment.  External controls differ from ‘internal 
controls’ that internal controls adjust the displacement of the compressor based on conditions 
within the A/C system, such has head pressure, suction pressure, or evaporator outlet 
temperature.  By controlling the displacement of the compressor by external means, the 
compressor load can be matched to the cooling demand of the cabin.  With internal controls, 
the amount of cooling delivered by the system may be greater than desired, at which point the 
cooled cabin air is then ‘reheated’ to achieve the desired cabin comfort.  It is this reheating of 
the air which results reduces the efficiency of the A/C system – compressor power is 
consumed to cool air to a temperature less than what is desired.   
Reducing reheat through external control of the compressor is a very effective strategy 
for improving A/C system efficiency.  The SAE IMAC team determined that an annual 
efficiency improvement of 24.1% was possible using this technology alone.34  The agencies 
estimate that additional improvements to  this technology are possible (e.g. the increased use 
of recirculated cabin air), and that when A/C control systems and components are fully 
developed, calibrated, and optimized to particular vehicle’s cooling needs,  an efficiency 
improvement of 42% can be achieved, compared to the baseline system. 
5.1.3.3.2 Reduced Reheat Using a Externally-Controlled, Fixed-Displacement or 
Pneumatic Variable-Displacement Compressor 
When using a fixed-displacement or pneumatic variable-displacement compressor 
(which controls the stroke, or displacement, of the compressor based on system suction 
pressure), reduced reheat can be realized by disengaging the compressor clutch momentarily 
to achieve the desired evaporator air temperature.  This disengaging, or cycling, of the 
compressor clutch must be externally-controlled in a manner similar to that described in 
2.3.2.1.  The agencies believe that a reduced reheat strategy for fixed-displacement and 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-33 
 
pneumatic variable-displacement compressors can result in an efficiency improvement of 
20%.  This lower efficiency improvement estimate (compared to an externally-controlled 
variable displacement compressor) is due to the thermal and kinetic energy losses resulting 
from cycling a compressor clutch off-and-on repeatedly.  
5.1.3.3.3 Defaulting to Recirculated Cabin Air 
In ambient conditions where air temperature outside the vehicle is much higher that 
the air inside the passenger compartment, most A/C systems draw air from outside the vehicle 
and cool it to the desired comfort level inside the vehicle.  This approach wastes energy 
because the system is continuously cooling the hotter outside air instead of having the A/C 
system draw its supply air from the cooler air inside the vehicle (also known as recirculated 
air, or ‘recirc’). By only cooling this inside air (i.e. air that has been previously cooled by the 
A/C system), less energy is required, and A/C Idle Tests conducted by EPA indicate that an 
efficiency improvement of 35-to-40% improvement is possible under the conditions of this 
test.  A mechanically-controlled door on the A/C system’s air intake typically controls 
whether outside air, inside air, or a mixture of both, is drawn into the system.  Since the 
typical ‘default’ position of this air intake door is outside air (except in cases where maximum 
cooling capacity is required, in which case, many systems automatically switch this door to 
the recirculated air position), EPA and NHTSA are specifying that, as cabin comfort and de-
fogging conditions allow, an efficiency credit be granted if a manufacturer defaults to 
recirculated air whenever the outside ambient temperature is greater than 75°F.  To maintain 
the desired quality inside the cabin (in terms of freshness and humidity), EPA believes some 
manufacturers will control the air supply in a ‘closed-loop’ manner, equipping their A/C 
systems with humidity sensors or fog sensors (which detect condensation on the inside glass), 
allowing them to adjust the blend of fresh-to-recirculated air and optimize the controls for 
maximum efficiency.  Vehicles with closed-loop control of the air supply (i.e. sensor 
feedback is used to control the interior air quality) will qualify for a 1.7 g/mi CO2 credit and a 
0.000124 gal/mi fuel consumption improvement.  Vehicles with open-loop control (where 
sensor feedback is not used to control interior air quality) will qualify for a 1.1 g/mi CO2 
credit and a 0.000124 gal/mi fuel consumption improvement.  We believe that the closed-loop 
control system will be inherently more efficient than the open-loop control system because the 
former can maximize the amount to recirculation to achieve a desired air quality and interior 
humidity level, whereas the latter will use a fixed ‘default’ amount of recirculated air which 
provides the desired air quality under worst case conditions (e.g. maximum number of 
passengers in the vehicle). 
Electric drive vehicles such as HEVs, PHEVs and EVs may require some fraction of 
the A/C cooling capacity to control the battery temperature under hot conditions.  PHEVs are 
most likely to require A/C cooling because their batteries have higher current requirements for 
all-electric driving than HEVs, and much less battery mass and energy storage than pure EVs.  
Some electrified vehicles today, such as the Nissan Leaf, cool their batteries with outside air, 
while others, such as the Toyota Prius and Ford Fusion Hybrid, use cooled cabin air, and the 
Chevrolet Volt is an example of a vehicle which uses a refrigerant loop to cool the battery.  
With the increased penetration of these electrified vehicles, it is possible that there will be 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-34 
 
some loss of efficiency of the A/C system (especially as it relates to cabin air recirculation).  
Vehicles which use cabin air to cool the battery must discharge this heated air outside the 
vehicle, rather than recirculating it through the climate control system.  Currently, EPA does 
not account for this A/C efficiency loss in the credit menu.  EPA and NHTSA request 
comments on the technical merits or applicability of accounting for this loss of efficiency 
within the crediting and fuel economy improvement scheme.    
5.1.3.3.4 Improved Blower and Fan Motor Controls 
In controlling the speed of the direct current (DC) electric motors in an air 
conditioning system, manufacturers often utilize resistive elements to reduce the voltage 
supplied to the motor, which in turn reduces its speed.  In reducing the voltage however, these 
resistive elements produce heat, which is typically dissipated into the air ducts of the A/C 
system.  Not only does this waste heat consume electrical energy, it contributes to the heat 
load on the A/C system.  One method for controlling DC voltage is to use a pulsewidth 
modulated (PWM) controller on the motor.  A PWM controller can reduce the amount of 
energy wasted, and based on Delphi estimates of power consumption for these devices, EPA 
and NHTSA believe that when more efficient speed controls are applied to either the blower 
or fan motors, an overall improvement in A/C system efficiency of 15% is possible.35   
5.1.3.3.5 Internal Heat Exchanger 
An internal heat exchanger (IHX), which is alternatively described as a suction line heat 
exchanger, transfers heat from the high pressure liquid entering the evaporator to the gas 
exiting the evaporator, which reduces compressor power consumption and improves the 
efficiency of the A/C system.  In the 2012-2016 rule, we considered that IHX technology 
would be required with the changeover to an alternative refrigerant such as HFO-1234yf, as 
the different expansion characteristics of that refrigerant (compared to R-134a) would 
necessitate an IHX.  The agencies believe that a 20% improvement in efficiency relative to 
the baseline configuration can be realized if the system includes an IHX, and a 1.1 g/mi credit

5.1.3.3.6 Improved-Efficiency Evaporators and Condensers 
The evaporators and condensers in an A/C system are designed to transfer heat to and 
from the refrigerant – the evaporator absorbs heat from the cabin air and transfers it to the 
refrigerant, and the condenser transfer heat from the refrigerant to the outside ambient air.  
The efficiency, or effectiveness, of this heat transfer process directly effects the efficiency of 
the overall system, as more work, or energy, is required if the process is inefficient.  A 
method for measuring the heat transfer effectiveness of these components is to determine the 
Coefficient of Performance (COP) for the system using the industry-consensus method 
described in the SAE surface vehicle standard J2765 – Procedure for Measuring System COP 
of a Mobile Air Conditioning System on a Test Bench.36 The bench test based engineering 
analysis that a manufacturer will submit at time of certification.  We will consider the baseline 
component to be the version which a manufacturer most recently had in production on the 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-35 
 
same vehicle or a vehicle in a similar EPA vehicle classification.  The design characteristics 
of the baseline component (e.g. tube configuration/thickness/spacing and fin density) are to be 
documented in an engineering analysis and compared to the improved components, along 
with data demonstrating the COP improvement.  This same engineering analysis can be 
applied to evaporators and condensers on other vehicles and models (even if the overall size 
of the heat exchanger is different), as long as the design characteristics of the baseline and 
improved components are the same.  If these components can demonstrate a 10% 
improvement in COP versus the baseline components, EPA and NHTSA estimate that a 20% 
improvement in overall system efficiency is possible.   
5.1.3.3.7 Oil Separator 
The oil present in a typical A/C system circulates throughout the system for the 
purpose of lubricating the compressor.  Because this oil is in contact with inner surfaces of 
evaporator and condenser, and a coating of oil reduces the heat transfer effectiveness of these 
devices, the overall system efficiency is reduced.37  It also adds inefficiency to the system to 
be “pushing around and cooling” an extraneous fluid that results in a dilution of the 
thermodynamic properties of the refrigerant.  If the oil can be contained only to that part of 
the system where it is needed – the compressor – the heat transfer effectiveness of the 
evaporator and condenser will improve.  The overall COP will also improve due to a 
reduction in the flow of diluent. The SAE IMAC team estimated that overall system COP 
could be improved by 8% if an oil separator was used.  EPA and NHTSA believe that if oil is 
prevented from prevented from circulating throughout the A/C system, an overall system 
efficiency improvement of 10% can be realized.  Whether the oil separator is a standalone 
component or is integral to the compressor design, manufacturers can submit an engineering 
analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the oil separation technology.  
5.1.3.4 Technical Feasibility of Efficiency-Improving Technologies 
EPA and NHTSA believe that the efficiency-improving technologies discussed in the 
previous sections are available to manufacturers today, are relatively low in cost, and their 
feasibility and effectiveness has been demonstrated by the SAE IMAC teams and various 
industry sources.  The agencies also believe that when these individual components and 
technologies are fully designed, developed, and integrated into A/C system designs, 
manufacturers will be able to achieve the estimated reductions in CO2 emissions and generate 
appropriate A/C Efficiency Credits, which are discussed in the following section. 
5.1.3.5 A/C Efficiency Test Procedures 
For model years 2014 to 2016, we are proposing three options for qualifying for A/C 
efficiency credits: 1) running the A/C Idle Test, as described in the 2012-2016 final rule, and 
demonstrating compliance with the CO2 threshold requirements, 2) running the A/C Idle and 
demonstrating compliance with engine displacement adjusted CO2 threshold requirements, 
and 3) running a newly-developed A/C test and reporting the test results.  For model years 
2017-2025, we are proposing that the A/C Idle Test requirement be eliminated, and that the 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-36 
 
newly-developed A/C test be used to quantify the A/C-related fuel consumption of new 
vehicles with efficiency-improving technologies, relative to a baseline vehicle, without these 
technologies.  All of these options continue to rely on the credit menu described below.  
These options are described in detail in this section. 
In the 2012-2016 final rule, manufacturers were required, starting in MY 2014, to 
demonstrate the efficiency of a vehicle’s A/C system by running an A/C Idle Test. If a vehicle 
met the emissions threshold of 14.9 g/min CO2 or lower on this test, a manufacturer was 
eligible to receive full credit for efficiency-improving hardware or controls installed on that 
vehicle. The vehicle would be able to receive A/C credits based on a menu of technologies.  A 
revised version of this technology menu is described below.  For vehicles with a result 
between 14.9 g/min and 21.3 g/min, a downward adjustment factor was applied to the eligible 
credit amount, with vehicles testing higher than 21.3 g/min receiving zero credits.  The details 
of this idle test can be found in the 2012-2016 final rule.  See 75 FR at 25426-27. 
In order to establish the value of this threshold for the 2012-2016 final rule, the EPA 
conducted an extensive laboratory testing program to measure the amount of additional CO2 a 
vehicle generated on the Idle Test due to A/C use.  The results of this test program are 
summarized in Table 5-9, and represent a wide cross-section of vehicle types in the U.S. 
market.  The average A/C CO2 result from this group of vehicles is the value against which 
results from vehicle testing will be compared.  The EPA conducted laboratory tests on over 60 
vehicles representing a wide range of vehicle types (e.g. compact cars, midsize cars, large 
cars, sport utility vehicles, small station wagons, and standard pickup trucks).

The majority of vehicles tested were from the 2006 and 2007 model years and their 
A/C systems are representative of the ‘baseline’ technologies, in terms of efficiency (i.e. to 
EPA’s knowledge, these vehicles do not utilize any of the efficiency-improving technologies 
described in the credit menu finalized for the 2012-2016 rule).  For the 2012-2016 rule, EPA 
attempted to find a correlation between the A/C CO2 results and a vehicle’s interior volume, 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-37 
 
footprint, and engine displacement, but found it to be minimal, as there is significant “scatter” 
in the test results.  This scatter is generally not test-to-test variation, but scatter amongst the 
various vehicle models and types.  This original analysis covered a wide range of vehicle size 
classes and vehicle types: from compact cars to light-duty trucks, some of which did not have 
readily-available SAE and CAFE interior volume numbers (i.e. the interior volume for small 
station wagons and pickup trucks had to be inferred from other published sources).  Due to the 
variability in the data, EPA chose a constant threshold value for the Idle Test performance, 
which provided access to the credit menu.    
Since the previous rule, manufacturers have had the opportunity to run the idle test on 
a wide variety of vehicles and have discovered that even though there may be a small 
correlation between engine displacement and the idle test result, the trend was important 
enough that small vehicles had higher A/C idle emissions and were more inclined to fail to 
meet the threshold for the Idle Test than larger vehicles were.  Specifically, vehicles with 
smaller displacement engines had a higher Idle Test result than those with larger displacement 
engines, even within the same vehicle platform.38  This was causing some small vehicles with 
advanced A/C systems to fail the Idle Test.  The load placed on the engine by the A/C system 
did not seem to be consistent, and in certain cases, larger vehicles perform better than smaller 
ones on the A/C idle test.   
When the EPA test data is sorted according to engine displacement, the relationship 
between engine displacement and idle test result are somewhat apparent, though there is 
significant variability as is evident in Figure 5-6.  The threshold value from the 2012-2016 
rule is included in the figure for comparison purposes.

Figure 5-6 Relationship Between EPA A/C Idle Test Results and Engine Displacement. 
One factor which may explain part of this observed phenomenon is that the brake-
specific fuel consumption (bsfc) of a smaller displacement engine is generally lower at idle 
than that of a larger displacement engine. At the idle condition, without A/C load applied, a 
smaller engine is generally more efficient (i.e. has a lower bsfc) than a larger engine, in terms 
of how well it converts fuel heat energy into power.  When additional load from the A/C 
system is added to the small displacement engine, the bsfc does not improve as dramatically 
as it does on a larger displacement engine, and if both the small- and large-displacement 
engines require a similar amount of engine power to run the A/C system, the larger engine 
will move from a “less-efficient” to “more-efficient” operating condition, whereas the smaller 
engine remains relatively flat, in terms of bsfc. The result is that a larger displacement engine 
uses less fuel to run the A/C system, relative to a smaller displacement engine, because its 
baseline condition (A/C off) is “less-efficient”, and the incremental amount of fuel used is 
lower.  The slope of the linear regression line for this data set is -1.58 g/min/L, with a zero 
intercept of 26.9 g/min.m

In the 2012-2016 final rule, the EPA chose a threshold of 30% improvement on the 
Idle Test as the threshold for accessing the credit menu (the justification and feasibility 
argument is presented again below).  This corresponded to a 6.4 g/min reduction from the 
average Idle Test result (or 14.9 g/min in the previous rule).  In this rule, EPA is proposing to 
maintain the 6.4g/min gap between the average emissions (equation of the line) and the 
threshold.   Equation 5-3 results in an idle test threshold which is scaled according to engine 
displacement, in liters. The threshold equation is overlaid on the data in Figure 5-7.  Using 
this equation, the idle test threshold for a 1.2L engine for example (to receive full credit) 
would be 18.6 g/min for a 6.0L engine the threshold would be 11.0 g/min.  
Equation 5-3 – A/C Idle Test Threshold

Even though the idle test may not fully capture the effect of each and every 
technology, we believe that the test does reflect the overall efficiency of the vehicle’s A/C 
system under a commonly encountered operating condition.  When the Idle Test is combined 
with a displacement-adjusted “threshold”, the EPA believes that this test is an appropriate 
criteria for a gaining access to A/C efficiency credits, at least until a new transient cycle can 
replace the Idle Test.   
We believe that part of the variation in the EPA’s A/C idle test results evident in the 
figure above, was due to the type of components a manufacture choose to use in a particular 
vehicle. Components such as compressors are shared across vehicle model types (e.g. a 
compressor may be ‘over-sized’ for one application, but the use of a common part amongst 
multiple model types results in a cost savings to the manufacturer), rather than being designed 
for one particular cabin size.  Some of the variation may also be due to the amount of cooling 
capacity a vehicle has at idle.  For instance, if the cooling capacity (or cooling performance) 
of a particular vehicle was less-than-optimal at idle (due to factors such as limitations of the 
compressor design, pulley ratio, or packaging), this vehicle could produce below-average A/C 
CO2 results, because the amount of energy required by the compressor would be lower.  Yet 
at higher engine and/or vehicle speeds, this same vehicle may have cooling capacity typical of 
other vehicles.  Therefore, a test which is limited to one area of A/C operation is limited in its 
ability to determine overall A/C system efficiency.   
Some of this variation between vehicle models may also be due to the efficiency of the 
fan(s) which draw air across the condenser – since an external fan is not placed in front of the 
vehicle during the A/C Idle Test, it is the vehicle’s radiator fan which is responsible for 
rejecting heat from the condenser (and some models may do this more efficiently than others).  
In this case, EPA believes that an SC03-type test – run in a full environmental chamber with a 
“road-speed” fan on the front of the vehicle – would be a better measure of how a vehicle’s 
A/C system performs under transient conditions, and any limitations the system may have at 
idle could be counter-balanced by improved performance and efficiency elsewhere in the 
drive cycle.  However, since idle is significant part of real-world and FTP drive cycles (idle 
represents 18% of the FTP), EPA believes that the focus in this rulemaking on A/C system 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-40 
 
efficiency under idle conditions is still justified.  EPA acknowledges that there are limitations 
to the Idle Test, however we have determined that it is still a valid tool evaluating the 
efficiency of a vehicle’s A/C system under some of the conditions encountered in daily 
vehicle use until a more appropriate test procedure is developed.  Moreover, we continue 
believe that a performance test is strongly preferred in order to assure that efficiency-
improving technologies are implemented properly and that the vehicle’s A/C system operates 
in an efficient manner under idle conditions.   
Since the 2012-2016 final rule, EPA has received a number of idle test results from 
several manufacturers.  Testing by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler has shown that there 
are some significant limitations to the idle test procedure.  As mentioned above, there was 
significant test-to-test variability noted, and many vehicles – especially those with smaller 
displacement engines – failed to meet the required test threshold (14.9 g/min) to qualify for 
A/C credits – even when such vehicles are equipped with a significant number of efficiency-
improving technologies listed in the menu.  These tested vehicles were from upcoming model 
years and had a variety of air conditioner components and controls strategies (from among the 
technologies described above and in the menu) implemented.  The results are shown in the 
Table 5-10 and are printed with permission from the manufacturers.

The test-to-test variability observed by the manufacturers was significant, and is likely 
due to high dilution of the exhaust sample (exhaust mass flow is low at idle), which results in 
greater measurement error, as there is less CO2 present for sampling than there would be 
under normal operating conditions.  Furthermore, fluctuations in cell ambient conditions (e.g. 
temperature and humidity), or in the way the driver is positioned in the seat, make accurate 
test-to-test comparisons of the results difficult to achieve.  In Figure 5-7, these new data 
points from the manufacturers are overlaid onto the idle test data collected in support of the 
2012-2016 final rule by the EPA.  Most of the EPA vehicles tested over the past two years did 
not contain a significant amount of efficient air conditioner components (off of the menu list).  
The manufacturer data is largely consistent with the EPA data.  The data support the notion 
that it might be more appropriate to use an increasing function of emissions as a function of 
engine displacement for a threshold, rather than the flat function we finalized in the 2012-
2016 rule.

The test cells on which an Idle Tests are conducted are typically the same cells which 
are used for FTP testing for criteria pollutants, where the allowable ambient temperature is 
68-to-86 °F, and there is no humidity specification.  Since there are normal, seasonal 
fluctuations in humidity level for this type of test cell, controlling the ambient conditions to 
those specified in the Idle Test procedure is difficult.  EPA is proposing that the allowable 
ambient air temperature condition be modified from to 75 ± 2 °F on average to 73-to-80°F on 
average, and the ambient humidity within the test cell be modified from 50 ± 5 grains of water 
per pound of dry air to 40-to-60 grains of water per pound of dry air.  EPA is requesting 
comment on whether these modifications to the Idle Test ambient conditions are sufficient, 
and whether the requirements for allowable instantaneous temperature and humidity 
conditions need to be modified as well.

With the revised threshold, it is still possible for a vehicle test to have some A/C 
technologies but still fail to meet the threshold for the credit menu.  For the present rule, the 
EPA is proposing to continue a gradual decrease in credits for vehicles that fail to meet the 
threshold.  To qualify for the full credit, it will be necessary for each vehicle certified to 
achieve an A/C CO2 result less than or equal to the threshold function (which is 30% less than 
the average value observed in the EPA testing). EPA chose the 30% improvement over the 
“average” value to drive the fleet of vehicles toward A/C systems which approach or exceed 
the efficiency of best-in-class vehicles.  EPA test results on three vehicle size classes (large

achieved by simply switching A/C control from outside air (OSA) to recirculated cabin air. As 
shown in Table 5-11, the percentage reduction in the CO2 and fuel consumption due to A/C 
use was greater than 30% in all three cases.

EPA believes this approach will cause manufacturers to tailor the size of A/C 
components and systems to the cooling needs of a particular vehicle model and focus on the 
overall efficiency of their A/C systems.  EPA believes this approach strikes a reasonable 
balance between avoiding granting credits for improvements which would occur in any case, 
and encouraging A/C efficiency improvements which would not otherwise occur.  However, 
as explained above, to avoid having an all-or-nothing threshold on the Idle Test to qualify for 
credits, EPA is proposing to allow some amount of credit as long as the Idle Test performance 
remains better than the best fit regression obtained from EPA testing.  A multiplier would be 
applied to the credits (based on the menu) such that if the difference between the Idle Test 
result and the threshold value (hereafter referred to as the “gap”) at the vehicle’s engine 
displacement is greater than 6.4g/min, then the multiplier would be 1.0, if the gap is 0.0 g/min 
or less, then the multiplier would be 0.0, the multiplier in between would follow a linear 
function as shown in the following figure.  The EPA is also proposing that manufacturers 
have the option of using these threshold adjustments as early as MY 2014.

EPA continues to recognize the limitations of the idle test applicable to MY 2014-
2016 vehicles.  The primary disadvantage is that the test does not capture the majority of the 
driving or ambient conditions in the real world when the A/C is in operation, and thus may 
only encourage the technologies that improve idle performance under narrow temperature 
conditions.  Another limitation is that the idle test can never quantify the incremental 
improvement of a given technology to generate an actual credit (without a menu).  In order to 
generate a credit value a more complex test procedure is required that can do an “A” to “B” 
comparison, where B is with the technology and A is without.  There were comments from a 
number of stakeholders reiterating some of these limitations.  The remainder of this section 
describes this effort.  The test procedure has evolved since the concepts described in the 2012-
2016 final rule.   
In preparation for this 2017-2025 proposal, EPA has initiated studies and continues to 
engage with manufacturers, component suppliers, SAE, and CARB in developing a procedure 
for determining A/C system efficiency and credits.  This effort also explores the applicability 
and appropriateness of a test method or procedure which combines the results of test-bench, 
modeling/simulation, and chassis dynamometer testing into a quantitative metric for 
quantifying A/C system (fuel) efficiency.  The goal of this exercise is the development of a 
reliable, accurate, and verifiable assessment and testing method while also minimizing a 
manufacturer’s testing burden.  This effort is still underway and may not even be complete in 
time for the final rule, however much progress has been made on the chassis dynamometer 
test procedure.   
The EPA, in cooperation with automotive manufacturers and CARB, initiated the 
development of a new A/C test procedure – one which would be capable (in part) of detecting 
the effect of more efficient A/C components and controls strategies during a transient drive 
cycle (rather than just idle).  This new test procedure, known as “AC17”, should more 
accurately reflect the impact that A/C use (and in particular, efficiency-improving 
components and control strategies), has on tailpipe CO2 emissions.   
The new AC17 test has four elements: a pre-conditioning cycle, a 30-minute solar 
soak period; Bag 1 is an SC03 drive cycle at 77 °F (to capture the “pull-down” portion of A/C 
operation); and Bag 2 is a highway fuel economy cycle (to capture the “steady-state” portion 
of A/C operation).  The test cycle is first run with the A/C on (Bags 1 and 2) and then re-run 
with the A/C off (Bags 3 and 4).  The A/C-related CO2 emissions are the difference between 
the A/C on and A/C off test results.  Initially, EPA is proposing that emissions from first and 
second bags be weighted equally, and that these results would be used to calculate the grams 
per mile emissions due to A/C use.  We are requesting comment on whether this weighting is 
appropriate for quantifying the typical effect of A/C use on tailpipe emissions.  EPA believes 
that this new test cycle will be able to capture improvements in all areas related to efficient 
operation of a vehicle’s A/C system: solar control; efficiency improving components; and 
efficient control strategies.  Below is a depiction of the new test cycle, which is still in draft 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-44 
 
form.  To assure consistent results for the fuel consumption effect of operating the A/C 
system, the test is always run in a warm condition, where an EPA Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle is run at the start of the test sequence, with the A/C off and 
the solar lamps on.  Immediately following this precondition phase, the engine is turned off 
and the vehicle soaks for 30 minutes with the solar lamps on.  At the conclusion of the solar 
soak, the “pull-down” (rapid cool-down of cabin temperature) phase begins.  This phase 
utilizes the existing SC03 drive cycle to simulate dynamic, urban driving conditions.  Finally, 
the highway fuel economy test cycle, or HFET, is used to simulate a “steady-state” driving 
condition, while the A/C system is maintaining the cabin temperature.  Each element of this 
proposed cycle exercises modes of operation seen in everyday use where cabin cooling is 
needed.  By running the vehicle through each of these conditions with and without the A/C 
system operating, we seek to understand the effect that soak, pull-down, and steady-state 
conditions have on the fuel consumption for a particular A/C system design or technology.   
The total time required to run this test on a single vehicle is approximately 4 hours (including 
A/C on/off).  EPA is taking comment on all aspects of this test procedure.  In particular, we 
are asking for comment on the appropriateness of using the AC17 test to evaluate new 
efficiency-improving technologies, with the goals of: quantifying the impact of a technology 
on A/C-related emissions and fuel consumption; establishing a value for the amount of credit 
a particular technology can generate; and ultimately, adding the technology to the list of 
efficiency-improving technologies (see Table 5-12).

EPA is also seeking comment on the ambient conditions and system control settings 
proposed for this test.  The proposed ambient temperature is 77+  2 °F average, and 77+  5 °F 
instantaneous,  with a humidity level in the test cell of 69 + 5 grains of water per pound of dry 
air average, and 69 + 10 grains instantaneous.  The ambient temperature and humidity 
conditions for the AC17 test were chosen because we believe that they represent a common 
operating condition for A/C use: extremely high temperatures, such as the 95 °F condition 
specified for today’s SC03 test, while encountered in certain parts of the United States, 
wouldn’t demonstrate the impact that technologies such as variable displacement compressors 
have on system efficiency under lower cooling demand conditions.  The proposed control 
settings for the “A/C ON” portions of the test (Phases 3 and 4 in Figure 5-9) are different for 
systems with automatic and manual climate controls.  Automatic systems will be set to a 72 
°F target temperature, with blower (or fan) speed and vent location controlled by the 
automatic mode.  Manual systems will set the temperature selector to full cold, blower speed 
at its highest setting, and the air supply set to “recirculated air” for the first 185 seconds of 
Phase 3. At the first idle of Phase 3 (186 to 204 seconds), the blower speed will be set to 
achieve 6 volts at the motor, temperature selector will be set to provide 55 °F at the center 
dash outlet, and the air supply set to “outside air”.  The recommended temperature selector 
and and blower control positions for manual systems will be identified by the manufacturer.      
EPA is taking comment on the proposed option which allows manufacturers to replace 
the A/C Idle Test threshold requirement, which starts in MY 2014, with a reporting-only 
AC17 test requirement for generating Efficiency Credits.  In MYs 2014-2016, to demonstrate 
that a vehicle’s A/C system is delivering the efficiency benefits of the new technologies, 
manufacturers will have the option to run the AC17 test procedure on each vehicle platform 
which incorporates the new, credit-generating technologies, and report the results from all 4 
phases of the test to EPA   In addition to reporting the test results, EPA is proposing to require 
that manufactures provide information about each test vehicle and its A/C system (e.g. vehicle 
class, model type, curb weight, engine size, transmission type,  interior volume, climate 
control type, refrigerant type, compressor type, and evaporator/condenser characteristics). We 
are seeking comment on whether this new test and reporting requirement approach is 
appropriate for generating and verifying A/C Efficiency Credits.  In addition, we are seeking 
comment on whether the list of vehicle and A/C system information to be provided by the 
manufacturers is sufficient. 
EPA further proposes that  for model years 2017 to 2025, the A/C Idle Test and 
threshold requirement be eliminated, and be replaced with the AC17 test.  For 2017 and 
beyond, manufacturers would run the AC17 test to validate the performance of a vehicle’s 
A/C technology, relative to a baseline vehicle which does not incorporate the efficiency-
improving technologies for which credit is being generated.  The baseline vehicle is one with 
characteristics which are similar to the new vehicle, only it is not equipped with efficiency-
improving technologies, or they are de-activated (e.g. forced cabin air recirculation).  
Presumably, this baseline vehicle would be from the same platform but a prior (re)design.  We 
recognize that it may not be possible to find a baseline vehicle which is identical (in terms of 
powertrain characteristics, as well as aerodynamic and parasitic losses) to the new vehicle.  
However, as we described in section 5.1.3 of this Joint TSD and Chapter 2 of the RIA, based 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-46 
 
on the simulated behavior of A/C systems in a variety of vehicles, we believe that the fuel 
used to operate the A/C system is largely dependent on the compressor size and cooling 
capacity of the system, and much less dependent on engine displacement or efficiency.  As 
such, we believe that it is technically appropriate for manufacturers to compare vehicles from 
different generations of redesign cycles in order to demonstrate that their efficient A/C 
systems can provide CO2 and fuel consumption reductions commensurate to the amount of 
credit that a particular vehicle can generate.   If the AC17 test result with the new technology 
demonstrates an emission reduction which is greater than or equal to the maximum credit 
potential (5g/mi for cars and 7.2 g/mi for trucks), full credit will be generated based on the 
menu (below).  However if the test result is less than the maximum credit potential, partial 
credit can still be generated, in proportion to how far away the result is from the expected 
result.  (As noted above, the agencies used the simulation tool to determine the maximum 
credit potential for indirect A/C credits.) 
The AC17 testing would first be required on  the highest-production-volume vehicle 
model from each platform for which credits are generated.  Because the new A/C test requires 
significant amount of time for each test (nearly 4 hours) and must be run in SC03-capable 
facilities, EPA believes that it is appropriate to limit the number of vehicles a manufacturer 
must test in any given model year by limiting the testing to one vehicle per platform.  For the 
purpose of the AC17 test and generating efficiency credits, a platform would be defined as a 
group of vehicles which have common body floor pan, chassis, and powertrain (e.g. engine 
and transmission) characteristics.  The credits generated using the AC17 approach would 
carry forward to subsequent model years, unless there is a significant change in either the 
platform design or A/C system components or control strategies.  EPA recognizes that a 
single platform designation may encompass a larger group of fuel economy label classes or 
car lines (40 CFR §600.002-93), such as passenger cars, compact utility vehicles, and station 
wagons.  And in cases where there are multiple A/C system variants within a platform - such 
as component designs, control strategies (e.g. manual or automatic), or number of evaporators 
- EPA is proposing that manufacturers would run the AC17 test on one of these variants in 
each subsequent model year, where applicable, until all variants have been tested.   In 
addition, EPA is proposing the manufacturers provide detailed information about the A/C 
systems in vehicles tested, both baseline and new, as well as a plot with the interior 
temperature of both vehicles, to confirm that there is equivalent or better cooling system 
performance in the new vehicle configuration.  EPA is proposing that interior temperature be 
measured at three locations: outlet of the center duct on the dash panel and behind the driver 
and passenger seat headrests.  For the headrest locations, the temperature measuring devices 
shall be 30 millimeters behind the headrest and 330 millimeters below the roof.  EPA requests 
comment on the new test, its use as an optional method of validating the function of A/C 
efficiency-improving technologies, and the appropriate weighting of each phase of the AC17 
test.  
EPA is taking comment on whether the AC17 test is appropriate for estimating the 
effectiveness of new efficiency-improving A/C technologies, and whether this test could be 
used to add new technologies and credit values to the list described in the next section.  EPA 
is also seeking comment on an option starting in 2017 to use the AC17 test with a 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-47 
 
performance threshold (rather than a comparison to a baseline vehicle test, in order to access 
the menu (similar to the role the idle test plays prior to 2017).  Lastly, EPA is seeking 
comment on an option starting in 2017 to use the actual results of the AC17 comparison to a 
baseline to determine the credits without the use of the credit menu.  This credit would still 
subject to the maximum car and truck efficiency credits.   
      
5.1.3.6 A/C Efficiency Credits and Quantification of Credits 
The EPA and NHTSA believe that it is possible to identify the A/C efficiency-
improving components and control strategies most-likely to be utilized by manufacturers and 
are proposing to assign a CO2 ‘credit’ and fuel economy improvement value to each.  In 
addition, the agencies recognize that to achieve the maximum efficiency benefit, some 
components can be used in conjunction with other components or control strategies.  
Therefore, the system efficiency synergies resulting from the grouping of three or more 
individual components are additive, and will qualify for a credit commensurate with their 
overall effect on A/C efficiency.  A list of these technologies – and the credit associated with 
each – is shown in Table 5-12.  If more than one technology is utilized by a manufacturer for 
a given vehicle model, the A/C credits can be added, but the maximum credit possible is 
limited to 5.0 g/mi for cars (equivalent to 0.000563 gal/mi) and 7.2 g/mi (equivalent to 
0.000810 gal/mi) for trucks.  More A/C related credits are discussed in the off-cycle credits 
section of this chapter.

*  This factor is a gasoline conversion from CO2 using 8887 g/CO2 per mpg, NHTSA 
is proposing to set this constant independent of fuel.  NHTSA seeks comment on setting fuel 
specific improvement factors, especially as it related to dual fuel vehicles (FFVs for example).   
Even though EPA is proposing a design based A/C credit program that introduces 
some minor revisions to what was finalized for the MY 2012-2016 rule, EPA continues to 
believe that a full performance based test procedure is the most appropriate way for 
quantifying A/C credits.  Performance based procedures propose no limits on the 
technological choices made by a manufacturer to improve efficiency.  Design based standards 
by their very nature choose technologies that are “winners” and “losers”, thus potentially 
stifling innovation and unique solutions.  Ideally, performance based standards would be the 
most appropriate method of quantifying A/C credits, however there are many challenges to 
accurately quantifying a small incremental decrease in emissions and fuel consumption 
compared to a relatively large tailpipe emissions and fuel consumption rate.  For example, it 
would be nearly impossible to distinguish and measure the impact of a 0.5g/mi improvement 
in tailpipe emissions due to an improved oil separator system incremental to a tailpipe 
250g/mi test procedure result.  The 0.5g/mi increment would be well within the noise of a test 
measurement or test-to-test variability.  Even if a number of the technologies were to be 
packaged together to account for a 5.0g/mi improvement, this is still only 2% of the tailpipe 
emissions value and still may be within test-to-test variability.  The other major challenge to 
quantifying credits is that it is not practical (from a compliance standpoint) to measure the 
CO2 emissions from a vehicle with and without a series of technologies that include hardware 
and software integrated in a complex fashion.  This could only be done with an “A” to “B” 
comparison where the “B” condition includes the technologies and the “A” condition does 
not.  Such A to B test comparisons require the manufacture of a prototype vehicle that is in all 
respects identical to the certified vehicle with the exception that the technologies being 
evaluated are removed.  This would be impossible to do for every vehicle certified for a fuel 
economy test.  It would even be prohibitive for a single vehicle demonstration for each 
manufacturer.  This might only be practical on a single vehicle research level program as was 
done in the IMAC study.  The proposed comparison of the AC17 test result to the baseline 
vehicle with the older technology will likely give an “A” to “B” comparison that is “close” 
based on the vehicle simulation results presented above, however, a more direct comparison is 
likely to give even more accurate quantification of credits such that the menu may no longer 
be required.  Also a baseline comparison is more challenging to do with vehicle models that 
do not have a predecessor (a completely new model).   
The IMAC study successfully demonstrated that there are methods by which the 
efficacy of technologies can be measured.  In the IMAC study, the efficiency of A/C 
components were measured on a test bench where the conditions can be precisely controlled.  
Test bench measurements are, by their nature, much more repeatable than chassis 
dynamometer tests.  They can also easily be used to do A to B comparisons of technology 
effectiveness since components can be relatively easily swapped out.  The limitations of test 
bench measurements primarily lie in the fact that they cannot capture the impact of the 
component integration into the vehicle.  The test bench only measures the efficiency of the 
A/C components, it cannot account for the controls strategy (for example), such as forced 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-50 
 
recirculation, not defaulting to reheat, and smart cycling of fixed displacement compressors.  
Another disadvantage of test benches are that there are few such facilities available in the 
United States and typical OEMs do not possess such extensive test benches as they do not 
manufacture A/C components.   
One option to circumvent the limitations of both the test bench and the chassis tests 
are to merge the two in a combined test procedure that will utilize the strengths of each to 
supplement the weaknesses of the other.  The test bench can generate the A to B comparison 
portion of the credit on the hardware changes, while the chassis test generates the A to B 
comparison of the (software) controls strategy changes.   
An A/C test bench typically measures the efficiency of a system by measuring its 
Coefficient of Performance (COP).  The COP of a heat pump is the ratio of the change in heat 
at the output to the supplied work (also equivalent to the SEER seasonal energy efficiency 
ratio rating on a residential A/C unit).n   The IMAC procedure employed the SAE procedure 
J2765 in order to bench test systems in a fashion that reflects national average A/C usage.  
This test procedure could be used to generate the efficiency of any production A/C system.  
The challenge lies in the comparison to the baseline “A” system for the A to B comparison.  
This could be done either with a defined hardware baseline system or a typical baseline COP 
value agreed upon by the industry.  The EPA requests comment on how to define this baseline 
system.   
Combining the bench test together with a chassis test requires a model, simulation or 
some calculation procedure (algorithm) to convert the test bench results to fuel economy and 
GHG emissions.  There are a number of options for this model.  The Lifecycle Climate 
Performance or LCCP model (also known as SAE J2766), developed by General Motors in 
partnership with SAE, NREL, EPA, is one such model, and was utilized for the IMAC 
project.  While the LCCP model took into account many factors concerning lifecycle 
emissions and fuel use (including the energy needed to manufacture a particular refrigerant), 
it may be possible to employ a portion that model, and only discern the effect of the A/C 
system efficiency of annualized fuel use due to A/C operation.  Since the LCCP model uses 
the results of SAE J2765 bench testing as an input, EPA is seeking comment on the feasibility 
of using a simplified version of this model for quantifying the efficiency of A/C system 
designs and components.  Another option is for the test bench to produce charts like the one in 
Figure 5-4.  This can then be used as an input into EPA’s vehicle simulation tool.  Whatever 
the method, such a series of models can convert a system COP into a change in fuel economy 
and CO2 emissions from the hardware changes in an A/C system.  The controls strategy 
changes in the menu will have to be measured with an A to B comparison on the chassis 
dynamometer test procedure described above.  To do this, the manufacturer would test a 
vehicle with a baseline controls strategy compared with a modified more efficient strategy.

 According to the second law of thermodynamics, the COP of a real heat pump system is limited to the Carnot 
cycle efficiency, which is the ratio of the low Temperature to the difference between the high and low 
temperatures (in Kelvin).

Though the EPA has not yet conducted a test program to test the feasibility of this concept, 
combining the results from the bench and dynamometer tests should give a quantitative 
assessment of the credits from an improved A/C system compared to a baseline system.   
Due to the relative complexity (and expense) of this demonstration, it would only be 
practical for a manufacturer to do this for only a small number of vehicle and A/C 
configurations in any given year.  The EPA has met with a few manufacturers, and they have 
informed the EPA that on any single vehicle platform, the A/C systems usually share similar 
configurations.  Most full line manufacturers only have a handful of vehicle platforms (in 
order to save on engineering and manufacturing costs).  Therefore, this compliance 
demonstration should only have to be conducted infrequently on a vehicle platform or A/C 
system redesign.  Based on the limited number of platforms and the relative infrequency of 
redesigns, EPA expects that any manufacturer may only be required to do a compliance 
demonstration of A/C credits perhaps one or two times per year on average in order to 
generate credits.   
The EPA requests comment on all aspects of this combined performance based test 
procedure in order to generate A/C credits without a the credit menu in contrast to the new 
vehicle AC17 comparison to the older baseline vehicle with the credit menu. 
5.1.4 Air Conditioner System Costs   
Air Conditioner Systems – These technologies include improved hoses, connectors 
and seals for leakage control.  They also include improved compressors, expansion valves, 
heat exchangers and the control of these components for the purposes of improving tailpipe 
CO2 emissions and fuel economy as a result of A/C use.   The GHG and fuel economy 
effectiveness is unchanged from estimates used for 2016 model year vehicles in the 2012-
2016 final rule.  
In the 2012-2016 rule, EPA estimated the DMC of direct/leakage reduction A/C 
controls at $17 (2007$) and for indirect/efficiency improvement controls at $53 (2007$).  
These DMCs become $18 (2009$) and $54 (2009$), respectively, when converted to 2009 
dollars for this analysis.  EPA continues to consider those DMCs to be applicable in the 
2012MY and continues to consider the technologies to be on the flat portion of the learning 
curve.  For this proposal, the 2012-2016 rule technologies represent the reference case in 
terms of controls and costs.  We have applied to those DMCs low complexity ICMs of 1.24 
through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter to generate the indirect costs for this reference case.  The 
resultant reference case costs are shown in Table 5-15. 
New for this proposal are additional costs for indirect/efficiency improvement control 
as those 2012-2016MY vintage systems penetrate to the entire fleet, and new costs associated 
with the alternative refrigerant—both the alternative refrigerant itself and the system changes 
to accommodate that refrigerant.  For the first of these—indirect controls—the agencies have 
estimated the DMC at $15 (2009$) applicable in the 2017MY.  The agencies consider this 
technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have used a low complexity 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-52 
 
ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.  For the alternative refrigerant, the agencies 
have estimated a DMC of $67 (2009$) applicable in the 2016MY.  The agencies consider this 
technology to be on the steep portion of the learning curve because it is only now starting to 
be used in a limited number of vehicles.  For this technology, the agencies have used a low 
complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2022 then 1.19 thereafter.  For the alternative refrigerant 
system costs (i.e., the hardware changes necessary to accommodate the alternative 
refrigerant), the agencies have estimated a DMC of $15 applicable in the 2016MY The 
agencies consider this technology to be on the flat portion of the learning curve and have used 
a low complexity ICM of 1.24 through 2018 then 1.19 thereafter.  The resultant control case 
costs are shown in Table 5-16.  
Note that these costs are expected to be incurred consistent with our estimated ramp 
up of manufacturer use of A/C credits.  For example, the direct credit for low GWP 
refrigerant use is 13.8 g/mi in MYs 2017-2025, but we estimate that the average credit earned 
by manufacturers would be 5.5 g/mi on cars in MY 2018 and 5.8 g/mi on trucks in that MY.  
Table 5-13 shows the credits by MY as we estimate they will be used for both cars and truck.   
Table 5-14 then shows how we have used these estimated credits to scale A/C-related costs by 
MY for both cars and trucks.  The percentages shown in Table 5-14 are included in the costs 
shown in Table 5-15 and Table 5-16.  
The total A/C related costs are shown in Table 5-17.

5.2 Off-Cycle Technologies and Credits  
EPA employs a five-cycle test methodology to evaluate fuel economy for fuel 
economy labeling purposes.  For GHG and CAFE compliance, EPA uses the established two-
cycle (city, highway or correspondingly FTP, HFET) test methodology.  EPA recognizes that 
there are technologies that provide real-world GHG benefits to consumers, but that the benefit 
of some of these technologies is not represented on the two-cycle test.  Therefore, EPA is 
continuing the off-cycle credit program from the 2012-2016 rule with some changes such as 
providing manufacturers with a list of pre-approved technologies for which EPA can quantify 
a default value that would apply unless the manufacturer demonstrates to EPA that a different 
value for its technology is appropriate. This list is similar to the menu driven approach 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-56 
 
described in the previous section on A/C efficiency credits.  With recent meetings with 
vehicle manufacturers, the EPA received comments that the public regulatory process for 
generating off-cycle credits was too cumbersome to utilize frequently if at all, and that the 
burden of proof to demonstrate a small incremental improvement on top of a large tailpipe 
measurement was impractical.  This is similar to the argument described above for 
quantifying air conditioner improvements.  These same manufacturers believed that such a 
process could stifle innovation and fuel efficient technologies from penetrating into the 
vehicle fleet.  For this purpose, the EPA is proposing a menu with a number of technologies 
that the agency believes will show real-world CO2 and fuel economy benefits which can be 
reasonably quantified a priori.  The estimates of these credits were largely determined from 
research, analysis and simulations, rather from full vehicle testing, which would have been 
cost and time prohibitive.   
In the 2012-2016 rule, EPA required that off-cycle technologies be innovative in 
nature.  Manufacturers insisted that “innovative” is not a term that can have an exact 
definition and have it applied to a technology.  They also informed EPA that there may be 
technologies that are quite old, but are utilized off-cycle and obtain real-world benefits.  The 
EPA agrees with these comments and are proposing to amend the 2012-2016 rules to no 
longer requiring that off-cycle technologies be “innovative”.     
 The agencies are not proposing to adjust the stringency of the proposed 2017-2025 
standards based on the off-cycle credit menu (with two limited exceptions for certain stop 
start technologies and for certain aerodynamic improvements, as described in section 
III.C.5.b.i of the preamble).  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, the agencies have 
very little technical information on these technologies.  The analysis presented below is based 
on a limited amount of data and an engineering analysis for each technology. Some of the 
analysis includes more detailed vehicle simulation however the activity (or usage profiles) 
may have a fair amount of uncertainty.  Second, the agencies have virtually no data on the 
cost, development time necessary, manufacturability, etc of these technologies.  The agencies 
thus cannot project that some of these technologies are feasible within the 2017-2025 
timeframe.  Third, the agencies have no data on what the rates of penetration of these 
technologies would be during the rule timeframe.  Fourth, as off-cycle technologies, they (by 
definition) typically do not affect the measurement of the 2-cycle fuel economy test 
procedure; therefore it may be incompatible to adjust a 2-cycle standard.  It is still justifiable 
to grant credits toward a 2-cycle test as the technologies should still have a real-world benefit.   
Some technologies provide a benefit on five-cycle testing, but show less benefit on 
two cycle testing.  In order to quantify the emissions impacts of these technologies, EPA will 
simply subtract the two-cycle benefit from the five-cycle benefit for the purposes of assigning 
credit values for this pre-approved list.  Other technologies, such as more efficient lighting, 
show no benefit over any test cycle.  In these cases, EPA will estimate the average amount of 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-57 
 
usage using MOVESo data if possible and use this to calculate a duty-cycle-weighted benefit 
(or credit).  In the 2012-2016 rule, EPA stated a technology must have “real world GHG 
reductions not significantly captured on the current 2-cycle tests…”  For this proposal, EPA is 
modifying this requirement to allow technologies as long as the incremental benefit in the 
real-world is significantly better than on the 2-cycle test.   
EPA is requesting comment on all aspects of the off-cycle credit menu derivation 
described below.  
5.2.1 Reducing or Offsetting Electrical Loads 
The EPA test cycles do not require that all electrical components to be turned on 
during testing.  Headlights, for example, are always turned off during testing.  Turning the 
headlights on during normal driving will add an additional load on the vehicle’s electrical 
system and will affect fuel economy.  More efficient electrical systems or technologies that 
offset electrical loads will have a real world impact on fuel economy but are not captured in 
the EPA test cycles.  Therefore, the EPA believes that technologies that reduce or offset 
electrical loads related to the operation or safety of the vehicle deserve consideration for off 
cycle credits. 
To evaluate technologies that reduce or offset electrical loads, the EPA conducted an 
analysis of the reduction in emissions corresponding to a general reduction of electrical 
demand in a vehicle.  Using EPA’s full vehicle simulation tool described in EPA’s draft RIA, 
the agency evaluated the change in fuel consumption for a 100W reduction in electrical load 
for a typically configured vehicle.  The impact of this load reduction was modeled on both the 
combined FTP/Highway cycles, and over the 5-cycle drive tests.  The results of this analysis 
form the basis for a consistent methodology that the EPA applied to several technologies to 
determine the appropriate off-cycle credits for those technologies.  
For the vehicle simulation, EPA assumed that high-efficiency alternators will be 
prevalent in most vehicles within the 2017-2025 timeframe of this rule, thus the simulation 
includes a high-efficiency alternator.  Figure 5-4 below shows a sample efficiency map of a 
high-efficiency alternator.  Based on this map, the EPA assumed a global average alternator 
efficiency of 65% for use in its modeling calculations.

Table 5-18 below shows the results of the simulation for four vehicle classes.  
Reducing the electrical load on a vehicle by 100W will result in an average of 3.0 g/mile 
reduction in CO2 emissions over the course of a combined FTP/Highway test cycle, or 3.7 
g/mile over a 5-cycle test.  A 100W reduction in electrical load yields a reduction in required 
engine power of roughly 0.15 kW (=0.1 kW / 65%), or 1-2% over the FTP/HWFE test cycles. 
 
Table 5-18: Simulated GHG reduction benefits of 100W reduction in electrical load over FTP/HW and 5-
cycle tests 
To determine the off-cycle benefit of certain 100W electrical load reduction 
technologies, the benefit of the technology on the FTP/Highway cycles (2-cycle test) is 
subtracted from the benefit of the technology on the 5-cycle test.  This determines the actual 
benefit of the technology not realized in the 2-cycle test methodology and in this case is 3.7 
g/mi minus 3.0 g/mi, or 0.7 g/mi.  However other technologies that exhibit efficiencies off-
cycle, but on neither the 5-cycle, nor the 2-cycle test can have their benefits as credits without 
subtraction.  An example of this is provided later.

5.2.1.1 High Efficiency Exterior Lights 
The current EPA test procedures are performed with vehicle lights (notably, 
headlights) turned off.  Because of this, improvement to the efficiency of a vehicle’s 
headlights is not captured in the existing test procedures and is appropriately addressed 
through the off-cycle crediting scheme. 
As with residential light bulbs, the technology available for vehicle lighting has 
changed significantly in recent years.  Vehicle manufacturers are commonly using advanced 
technology LEDs in taillights and offering new light producing technologies for headlights.  If 
these technologies require less energy to operate, they will improve the overall fuel economy 
of the vehicle and will be eligible for an off-cycle credit. 
Select trade press articles suggest that high-efficiency LEDs would save 
approximately 75% of the energy consumption of conventional headlamps.  However, 
Schoettle, et al40, studied the effects of high-efficiency LED lighting and found that this 
estimate, for the vehicle as a system, to be on the high side.  Table 5-10 provides a summary 
(excerpted from that study) of average lighting power requirements for both baseline and high 
efficiency lights for late-model vehicles. 
Table 5-19:  Average power requirement for various lights on a late-model vehicle for traditional and 
LED systems (Schoettle, et al) 
 
Usage rates were also provided by Schoettle et al, and are reproduced below in Table 
5-11.  Using this data, headlight operation at night is split into 91% low beam operation and  
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-60 
 
9% high beam operation.  The parking/position, side markers, tail lights and license plate light 
are all considered to be on 100% of nighttime driving.  Turn signals are estimated to be in 
operation for 5% of all driving.  Off-cycle credit for braking lights is considered negligible, 
because vehicle braking is as prevalent on the 2-cycle test, if not more, than over the 5-cycle 
test. 
Table 5-20:  Usage rates for various lighting components on a late-model vehicle (Schoettle, et al) 
 
A simple activity-weighted average of the aforementioned categories yields an 
average nighttime power consumption (for the categories in question) of roughly 180W for a 
baseline vehicle and 120 W for a vehicle with high efficiency lights.  The calculations for the 
lights are shown in Table 5-21, below. 
Table 5-21:  EPA calculations of High Efficiency Light Savings Potential (Nighttime Driving) 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-61 
 
 
Assuming that a set of standard exterior lights are replaced with high-efficiency LEDs, 
it would represent approximately a 60W savings during nighttime driving, and that nighttime 
driving represents approximately 50% of nationwide VMT (based Schoettle et al), the savings 
in the above example would amount to the equivalent of 30W averaged over all driving.  
Based on the GHG savings for a 100W electrical load reduction (presented in section 5.2.1) 
and scaling to 30W, EPA estimates that high-efficiency LEDs would be eligible for a credit of 
approximately 1.1 CO2 g/mile.  To be eligible for the credit, manufacturers must include high 
efficiency lights for all components listed in Table 5-21 with the exception of headlights (low 
and high beam). 
The 60W savings shown above largely excludes headlights (low and high beam) due 
to their relatively small weighting in the averaged power savings estimate.  Additionally, 
informal discussions with lighting suppliers indicate that the savings potential of headlights is 
highly variable and application-dependent.  EPA and NHTSA believe there may be significant 
GHG savings due to high efficiency headlights, and seek comment on the savings potential 
for high efficiency headlights.   
LEDs used for decorative or accent lighting is not eligible for the credit as they are 
considered optional accessories or “features”.  Additionally, daytime running lights (DRLs) 
are not required by law, therefore EPA considers them an optional accessory and ineligible for 
off-cycle credits.  EPA seeks comment on the application of the credit to daytime running 
lights.   
5.2.1.2 Engine Heat Recovery 
The combustion process that powers most of today’s vehicles results in a significant 
amount of exhaust heat.  Most of this heat leaves the engine in the form of waste hot exhaust 
gasses which are expelled from the vehicle through the exhaust system, or through hot coolant

which cycles from the engine to the radiator for expulsion.  Recapturing some portion of this 
wasted heat energy and using it to offset the electrical requirements of the vehicle will lead to 
improved fuel efficiency.   
Regardless of the design of the heat recovery system, whether it is exhaust or coolant 
based, the EPA assumes that any recovered energy will be in the form of electricity and will 
be used to recharge the vehicle’s battery (primarily for HEVs or PHEVs).  This is consistent 
with currently proposed designs.  EPA expects that engine heat recovery systems will provide 
some benefit on the two-cycle tests; therefore the off-cycle credit will be based on the 
difference between the two-cycle and five-cycle tests.  From Table 5-18, this difference is 0.7 
g/mile per 100W of electric load reduction.  For every 100W of thermoelectric device 
capacity, the vehicle off-cycle credit will be 0.7 g/mile.  
5.2.1.3 Solar Roof Panels 
Manufacturers are beginning to offer the option to put solar cells on the roof of a 
vehicle.  The solar roof option on the new Toyota Prius is an example.  The initial 
implementation of this idea has been limited to cabin ambient temperature control (see 
thermal/solar load control below), but manufacturers have raised the possibility of using roof 
top solar cells to charge PHEV, and EV batteries and provide energy to operate the vehicle, 
increasing the vehicle’s all electric range.  This electrical energy cannot be accounted for on 
the current EPA cycles.  Only PHEV and EVs are eligible for this credit.   
Using engineering judgment, the EPA estimates that vehicles with a solar roof would 
be parked in sunlight on average four hours a day, and that the solar panels will be 50W 
capable. The EPA also assumes that the solar cells will produce 50% of their rated power of 
50W (due to the solar angle, parking conditions, weather conditions, etc.) with a battery 
efficiency of 80%.  A vehicle with this configuration could save up to 80 Wh/day of electrical 
energy.  The EPA seeks comments on these assumptions and requests more data to refine 
these numbers.   
Using an assumption (based on MOVES) of 1 hour/day average vehicle usage, this 
yields an avoided electrical load of (on average) 80W.  A reduction of 80W in electrical load 
represents a reduction potential (for large batteries) of approximately 2.7-3.1 g/mi for a 50W-
capable solar roof panel.  These reductions are subject to revision based on changes to key 
assumptions (such as maximum potential electrical consumption rate during vehicle 
operation, solar cell efficiency and exposure rates).  EPA will also consider scaling this credit 
for solar roof panels that provide more or less power than 50W. 
5.2.2 Active Aerodynamic Improvements 
The aerodynamics of a vehicle plays an important role in determining fuel economy.  
Improving the aerodynamics of a vehicle reduces drag forces that the engine must overcome 
to propel the vehicle, resulting in lower fuel consumption.  The aerodynamic efficiency of a 
vehicle is usually captured in a coast down test that is used to determine the dynamometer 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-63 
 
parameters used during both the two-cycle and five-cycle tests.  This section discusses active 
aerodynamic technologies that are activated only at certain speeds to improve aerodynamic 
efficiency while preserving other vehicle attributes or functions.  Two examples of active 
aerodynamic technologies are active grill shutters and active ride height control.  Active 
aerodynamic features can change the aerodynamics of the vehicle according to how the 
vehicle is operating, and the benefit of these vehicle attributes may not be fully captured 
during the EPA test cycles.  
EPA is proposing to limit credits to active aerodynamic systems only (not passive).  
The reason for this is that passive systems are too difficult to define and isolate as a 
technology.  For example, the aerodynamic drag on the vehicle is highly dependent on the 
vehicle shape, and the vehicle shape is (in turn) highly dependent on the design characteristics 
for that brand and model.  EPA feels that it would be inappropriate to grant off-cycle credits 
for vehicle aesthetic and design qualities that are passive and fundamentally inherent to the 
vehicle.   
To evaluate technologies that reduce aerodynamic drag, the EPA conducted an 
analysis of the reduction in emissions corresponding to a general reduction of aerodynamic 
drag on a vehicle.  Using EPA’s full vehicle simulation tool described in EPA’s draft RIA, the 
agency evaluated the change in fuel consumption for increasing reductions in aerodynamic 
drag for a typically configured vehicle.  The results of this analysis form the basis for a 
consistent methodology that the EPA applied to technologies that provide active aerodynamic 
improvements. 
Vehicle aerodynamic properties impact both the combined FTP/Highway and 5-cycle 
tests.  However, these impacts are larger at higher speeds and have a larger impact on the 5-
cycle tests.  By their nature of being “active” technologies, EPA understands that active 
aerodynamic technologies will not be in use at all times.  While deployment strategies for 
different active aerodynamic technologies will undoubtedly vary by individual technology, 
the impact of these technologies will mostly be realized at high speeds.  Since aerodynamic 
loading is highest at higher speeds, EPA expects that active aerodynamic technologies will 
generally be in use at high speeds, and that the5-cycle tests will capture the additional real 
world benefits not quantifiable with the FTP/Highway test cycles due to the higher speed in 
the US06 cycle.  Active aero may also depend on weather conditions.  For example, active 
aerodynamics may operate less in hot weather when air cooling is required to exchange heat 
at the condenser.  Also, active grill shutters may need to stay open during snowy conditions in 
order to prevent them from freezing shut (potentially causing component failure). 
Using EPA’s full vehicle simulation tools, the impact of reducing aerodynamic drag 
was simulated on both the combined FTP/Highway cycles and the 5-cycle drive tests.  To 
determine the fuel savings per amount of aerodynamic drag reduction, the fuel savings on the 
FTP/Highway test cycle was subtracted from the fuel savings on the 5-cycle tests.  This is 
consistent with the approach taken for other technologies.  Table 5-22 shows the results of the 
vehicle simulation.  Also, Figure 5-11 represents this GHG reduction metrics in a graphical 
form.  These results assume that the active aerodynamics affects the coefficient of drag only, 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-64 
 
which is currently assumed to be constant over a wide range of vehicle operating speed.  
However, if the coefficient of aerodynamic drag is assumed to be vehicle speed dependent, 
then a different relationship could result. 
Table 5-22:  Simulated Maximum GHG Reduction Benefits of Active Aerodynamic Improvements 
 
 
Figure 5-11 Simulated GHG Reduction Benefits of Active Aerodynamic Improvements 
One example of an active aerodynamic technology is active grill shutters.  This 
technology is a new innovation that is beginning to be installed on vehicles to improve 
aerodynamics.  Nearly all vehicles allow air to pass through the front grill of the vehicle to 
flow over the radiator and into the engine compartment.  This flow of air is important to 
prevent overheating of the engine (and for proper functioning of the A/C system), but it 
creates a significant drag on the vehicle and is not always necessary.  Active grill shutters

close off the area behind the front grill so that air does not pass into the engine compartment 
when additional cooling is not required by the engine.  This reduces the drag of the vehicle, 
reduces CO2 emissions, and increases fuel economy.  When additional cooling is needed by 
the engine, the shutters open until the engine is sufficiency cooled.   
Based on manufacturer data, active grill shutters provide a reduction in aerodynamic 
drag (Cd) from 0 to5% when deployed.  EPA expects that most other active aerodynamic 
technologies will provide a reduction of drag in the same range as active grill shutters.  EPA 
also expects that active aerodynamic technologies may not always be available during all 
operating conditions.  Active grill shutters, for example, may not be usable in very cold 
temperatures due to concerns that they could freeze in place and cause overheating.  Control 
and calibration issues, temperature limitations, air conditioning usage, and other factors may 
limit the usage of grill shutters and other active aerodynamic technologies.  Therefore, EPA is 
proposing to provide a credit for active aerodynamic technologies that any of these 
technologies will achieve an aerodynamic drag of at least 3% improvement.  The proposed 
credit will be 0.6 g/mile for cars and 1.0 g/mile for trucks, in accordance with the simulation 
results in Table 5-22.  It is conceivable that some systems can achieve better performance.  
Manufacturers may apply for greater credit for better performing systems through the normal 
application process described in Section III.C of the preamble. 
5.2.3 Advanced Load Reductions 
The final category of off-cycle credits includes technologies that reduce engine loads 
by using advanced vehicle controls.  These technologies range from enabling the vehicle to 
turn off the engine at idle, to reducing cabin temperature and thus A/C loading when the 
vehicle is restated.  Because the benefit of these technologies is not fully captured on the 
combined two cycle tests, EPA has evaluated each technology and developed off-cycle credits 
for each technology individually. 
 
5.2.3.1 Engine Start-Stop (Idle Off) 
Engine start-stop technologies enable a vehicle to turn off the engine when the vehicle 
comes to a rest, and then quickly restart the engine when the driver applies pressure to the 
accelerator pedal.  The benefit of this system is that it largely eliminates fuel consumption at 
idle.  The EPA FTP (city) test does contain short periods of idle, but not as much idle as is 
often encountered in real world driving.  HEV and PHEVs can also idle-off and are thus 
eligible for this credit.  EVs and FCVs do not have engines and thus are not eligible for this 
credit.   
Based on a MOVES estimate that 13.5% of all driving (in terms of vehicle hours 
operating) nationwide is at idle, and compared to a 9% idle rate for the combined (two-cycle) 
test, idle-off could theoretically approach an extra 50% of the existing benefit seen on the 
FTP/HWFE test.  Vehicle simulation data was used to quantify the amount of fuel consumed 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-66 
 
in idle conditions over the FTP and HFET test across a range of vehicle classes.  For each 
vehicle class reviewed, a FTP-HFET combined fuel consumption was calculated and 
compared to total fuel consumption during the combined test.  The ratio of idle fuel to total 
fuel represents a maximum theoretical fuel consumption, and hence GHG emissions, that 
could be reduced by eliminating idlingp.  Table 5-23 shows this below: 
 
Table 5-23: Calculation of Off-Cycle Credit for Stop Start Technologies 
Based on this data, EPA suggests that idle-off technology is theoretically capable of 
providing 3.8 g/mi credit for passenger vehicles and up to 6.0 g/mi for trucks.  However, cold 
and hot ambient conditions will prevent idle-off in all cases.  The percentage of nationwide 
VMT driven above a 45 °F ambient temperature is approximately 75%.  Therefore, EPA and 
NHTSA propose 75% of the theoretical savings above will be appropriate for an idle off 
credit; this equates to 2.9 g/mi for passenger vehicles and 4.5 g/mi for trucks.  Electric heater 
circulation pump credits, described below, may be added to this credit.  
                                                 
p
  Note that aggressive fuel cutoff upon vehicle decelerations are technically possible and could increase the total 
amount of avoided “idle” fuel consumption; at the same time, the idle-off enable conditions might reduce the 
total idle avoidance.  Given the accuracy level of this methodology, EPA assumes these caveats to cancel each 
other out.

5.2.3.2 Electric Heater Circulation Pump  
Conventional vehicles use engine coolant circulated by the engine’s water pump to 
provide heat to the cabin during operation in cold ambient conditions.  Since the coolant is 
only circulated when the engine is running, very little heat is available to the cabin occupants 
if the engine is stopped during idle in vehicles equipped with stop-start.  Stop-start equipped 
vehicles generally disable the feature during cold ambient temperatures to ensure cabin heat is 
always available. However, stop-start operation can be expanded to much colder ambient if a 
means of continuing to circulate coolant during idle stop is employed.  An electric heater 
circulation pump takes the place of the engine’s water pump to continue circulating hot 
coolant through the heater core when the engine is stopped during a stop-start event.  Stop 
Start, HEV, and PHEVs are only eligible for this credit.   
Because the engine does not generate any more heat when it is shut off during idle, the 
amount of heat available to be moved to the cabin is limited by the thermal mass of the 
engine.  The heater core acts like a radiator to remove heat from the engine and deliver it to 
the cabin.  After some period of time, depending on engine mass, ambient temperature, and 
desired cabin temperature, the coolant temperature would drop to a level where comfort 
would not be maintained and the engine could cool off to a point where cold start features 
would be needed (which increase fuel consumption).  The stop-start control system would 
turn the engine back on before either of these conditions are reached.  The coolant circulation 
pump is electrically powered and therefore uses some energy when in use. 
EPA evaluated the effectiveness of this system using the same approach that was used 
for start stop technology.  Based on MOVES data, the percentage of nationwide VMT below 
45 °F is 25%.  EPA assumes that vehicles with start stop systems will have to keep the engine 
running for cabin heat if the ambient temperature is less than 45 °F, unless the vehicle also 
has an electric heater circulation system.  Therefore, a vehicle with both systems can utilize 
the start stop technology 25% more of the time.  Based on the maximum credit of 3.8 g/mi 
and 6.0 g/mi calculated in the previous section, the credit available for an electric heater 
circulation pump is 1.0 g/mi for passenger vehicles and 1.5 g/mi for trucks.   EPA determined 
that the electrical draw on the pump itself is small enough to be negligible in this calculation. 
5.2.3.3 Active Transmission Warm-Up 
When a vehicle is started and operated at cold ambient temperatures, there is 
additional drag on drivetrain components due to cold lubricants becoming more viscous 
which increases fuel consumption and GHG emissions.  This effect is more pronounced at 
colder temperatures and diminishes as the vehicle warms up.  Components affected by this 
additional drag include the engine, torque converter, transmission, transfer case, differential, 
bearings and seals.  Some components, such as the transmission, can take a long time to warm 
to operating temperature.  Automakers sometimes delay the application of very effective fuel-
saving measures such as torque converter lockup in order to help the transmission reach 
operating temperature more quickly.   
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-68 
 
Active Transmission warm-up uses waste heat from a vehicle’s exhaust system to 
warm the transmission oil to operating temperature quickly using a heat exchanger in the 
exhaust system.  This heat exchanger loop must have a means of being selectable, so that the 
transmission fluid is not overheated under hot operating conditions.  In cold temperatures, the 
exhaust heat warms the transmission fluid much more quickly than if the vehicle relies on 
passive heating alone.  Other methods of heating the fluid can be implemented using electric 
heat for example, but these are not included in this analysis because of the additional energy 
consumption that would likely eliminate most of the benefit.  This technology could also be 
used for other driveline fluids such as axle and differential lubricant on rear-wheel-drive 
vehicles or even engine oil, but only transmission fluid warming is considered here. 
There is a lot of variability in which components are affected by cold temperatures and 
for how long due to the type of vehicle and how it is operated.  Active transmission warm-up 
applied to a conventional front-wheel-drive vehicle will warm the transmission, torque 
converter, and differential lubricants because in most cases these components share the same 
lubricant.  On a rear-wheel-drive vehicle such as a truck, active transmission warm-up would 
only affect the transmission and torque converter.  The rear axle and differential lubricant, and 
the transfer case and front axle and differential lubricants in a four-wheel-drive vehicle would 
not be heated.  Additionally, a vehicle operated under a heavy load will tend to warm these 
lubricants more quickly with or without active heating. 
Using Ricardo modeling data and environmental data from EPA’s MOVES model, 
EPA calculated the estimated benefit of active transmission warm-up.  The Ricardo data 
indicates that there is a potential to improve GHG emissions by 7% at 20 °F if the vehicle is 
fully warm.  EPA assumed that given that this technology only affects the transmission (and 
differential on a FWD vehicle) and that the technology does take some time to warm the 
transmission fluid, one third of this benefit would be available, or 2.3%.  EPA then assumed 
the benefit would decay in a linear fashion to 0% at 72 °F. 
Using MOVES data, EPA calculated the weighted average VMT at temperatures 
below about 70-80 °F, where the two-cycle FTP testing is conducted.  These temperatures 
were arranged in 10 °F bins and a temperature and VMT-weighted benefit of 1.8 gpm was 
calculated for a midsize car.  No benefit is assumed during the FTP, so nothing is subtracted 
from this result.  EPA believes an off-cycle benefit of 1.8 grams/mile is possible using active 
transmission warm-up. 
 
5.2.3.4 Active Engine Warm-Up 
Like active transmission warm-up, active engine warm-up uses waste heat from a 
vehicle’s exhaust system to warm targeted parts of the engine, reducing drag and increasing 
fuel economy.  EPA assumed that of the 7% emission reduction available due to active drive 
train warming, that one third would be available for actively warming the transmission.  EPA 
also assumes that another one third would be available for active engine warm-up, resulting in 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-69 
 
a possible 1.8 grams/mile off-cycle benefit.  Active engine warm-up test data provided by 
manufacturers resulted in the calculation of a similar emission reduction. 
 
5.2.3.5 Thermal (and Solar) Control Technologies 
EPA is proposing a credit for technologies which reduce the amount of solar energy 
which enters a vehicle’s cabin area, reduce the amount of heat energy build-up within the 
cabin when the vehicle is parked, and/or reduce the amount of cooling/heating energy 
required through measures which improve passenger comfort.  The State of California Air 
Resources Board (CARB) has studied the effectiveness of many of these technologies, and 
had proposed including them in their Cool Cars and Environmental Performance Label 
programs.41  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted an extensive 
research project as part of the SAE’s Improved Mobile Air Conditioning Cooperative 
Research Program (I-MAC).  The purpose of this program was to study the effectiveness of a 
variety of technologies which can reduce the amount of fuel used for the purpose of climate 
control in light-duty vehicles.  In this study, known as the Vehicle Ancillary Loads Reduction 
Project, NREL estimated the effectiveness of window glazing/shades, paint, insulation, and 
seat and cabin ventilation technologies in reducing A/C-related fuel consumption and 
emissions.42  EPA has evaluated these technologies and assigned a credit amount for each, 
based on their ability to reduce cabin air temperatures during soak periods and improve 
passenger comfort. 
Based on the NREL’s studies, which estimated  that when these technologies are 
combined, a 12 °C reduction in cabin air temperature during soak will result in a 26% 
reduction in A/C-related fuel consumption, or a 2.2% reduction in fuel consumption (and by 
extension, CO2 emissions) for each 1 °C reduction in cabin air temperature..43  If the A/C-
related CO2 emissions impact is 13.8 g/mi for cars and 17.2 g/mi for trucks, this 2.2% 
reduction in CO2 emissions results in a credit of 0.3 g/mi for cars (13.8 g/mi x 0.022) and a 
credit of 0.4 g/mi for trucks (17.2 g/mi x 0.022) for each degree centigrade reduction in cabin 
air temperature. 
5.2.3.5.1 Glazing 
When a vehicle is parked in the sun, more than half of the thermal energy that enters 
the passenger compartment is solar energy transmitted through, and absorbed by, the vehicle’s 
glazing (or glass).42  The solar energy is both transmitted through the glazing and directly 
absorbed by interior components, which are then heated, and absorbed by the glass, which 
then heats the air in the passenger compartment through convection and interior components 
through re-radiation.  By reducing the amount of solar energy that is transmitted through the 
glazing, interior cabin temperatures can be reduced, which results in a reduction in the amount 
of energy needed to cool the cabin and maintain passenger comfort.  Glazing technologies 
exist today which can reduce the amount of solar heat gain in cabin by reflecting or absorbing 
the infrared solar energy.  NREL’s study determined that cabin air temperature could be 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-70 
 
reduced by up to 9.7 °C with use of glazing technologies on all window locations.  
Technologies such as window films and coatings and absorptive or solar-reflective material 
within the glass itself are currently used in automotive glazings, both for privacy (e.g. tinting) 
and improved passenger comfort.  One measure of the solar load-reducing potential for 
glazing is Total Solar Transmittance, or Tts, which is expressed in terms of the percentage of 
solar energy which passes through the glazing.  Lower Tts values for glazing result in lower 
cabin temperatures during solar soak periods.  EPA considers the April 15, 2008 version of 
the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) 13837 - standard to be the 
appropriate method for measuring the solar transmittance of glazing used in automotive 
applications. 
A method for estimating the effect of the solar performance of glazing technologies 
was developed by EPA and CARB, with input from NREL and the Enhanced Performance 
Glass Automotive Association (EPGAA). This method utilizes the measured Tts of the 
glazing used in a vehicle to estimate its effect on cabin temperature during soak conditions.  
The contribution that each glass/glazing location on the vehicle has on the overall interior 
temperature reduction is determined by its Tts (relative to a baseline level) and its area.  For 
purposes of this proposal, EPA considers the basline Tts to be 62% for all glazing locations, 
except for rooflites, which have a baseline Tts of 40%.  The relationship between the Tts 
value for glass/glazing and a corresponding reduction in interior temperature is has been 
established using the data from NREL testing, as shown in Table 5-24.

Using the NREL data and estimated temperature reductions, the linear correlation 
between Tts and breath air (interior) temperature reduction was developed, and is shown in 
Figure 5-11. 
Figure 5-12 Correlation Between Tts and Estimated Interior Temperature Reduction 
 
From the slope of this correlation between the Tts value and reduction in cabin air 
(also referred to as “breath air”) temperature, a method for estimating the amount of interior 
temperature reduction (in degrees Celcius) for a specific glass location and its Tts 
specification was developed, and is shown in Equation 5-4 .

To determine the total amount of glass/glazing credit generated for a given vehicle, the 
contribution (in terms of estimated temperature reduction) for each glazing location is 
calculated using the glass manufacturer’s Tts specification.  The contribution of each glass 
location is then normalized to determine the effect each glazing location on the overall vehicle 
temperature reduction.  The method for normalizing the contributions is to to multiply the 
estimated temperature reduction of Equation 5-4 by the ratio of the glass area of each location

divided by the total glass area of the vehicle.   The total vehicle temperature reduction is the 
sum of the normalized contributions for each location.  To calculate the glazing credit 
generated (in grams of CO2 per mile), the sum of the total vehicle temperature reduction (in 
degrees Celsius) multiplied by 0.3 for cars, or 0.4 for trucks.  
 
5.2.3.5.2 Active Seat Ventilation 
The NREL study investigated the effect that ventilating the seating surface has on the 
cooling demand for a vehicle.  By utilizing a fan to actively remove heated, humid air that is 
typically trapped between the passenger and the seating surface, passenger comfort can be 
improved, and NREL’s Thermal Comfort Model predicted that  A/C system cooling load 
could be reduced, and a 7.5% reduction in A/C-related emissions can be realized.43  While 
seat ventilation technology does not lower the cabin air temperature, it indirectly affects the 
load placed on the A/C system through the occupants selecting a reduced cooling demand due 
to their perception of improved comfort.  Using the EPA estimate for the A/C-related CO2 
emissions impact of 13.8 g/mi for cars and 17.2 g/mi for trucks, a 7.5% reduction in CO2 
emissions with active seat ventilation results in a credit of 1.0 g/mi for cars (13.8 g/mi x 
0.075) and a credit of 1.3 g/mi for trucks (17.2 g/mi x 0.075). 
5.2.3.5.3 Solar Reflective Paint 
As the vehicle’s body surface is heated by solar energy when parked, heat is 
transferred to the cabin through conduction and convection.  Paint or coatings which increase 
the amount of infrared solar energy that is reflected from the vehicle surface can reduce cabin 
temperature during these solar soak periods.  While the amount of heat entering the cabin 
through the body surface is less than that which enters through the glazing, its effect on cabin 
air heat gain is measureable.  NREL testing estimated that solar-reflective paint and coatings 
can reduce cabin air temperature by approximately 1 °C, whereas glazing technologies can 
reduce cabin air temperature by up 10 °C.  Using the EPA estimate for credits due to cabin air 
temperature reductions of 0.3 g/mi for cars 0.4 g/mi for trucks for each degree centigrade of 
temperature reduction, a 1.2 °C reduction due to solar reflective paint results in a credit of 0.4 
g/mi for cars and 0.5 g/mi for trucks. 
5.2.3.5.4 Passive and Active Cabin Ventilation 
Given that today’s vehicle are fairly well sealed (from an air leakage standpoint), the 
solar energy that enters the cabin area through conductive and convective heat transfer is 
effectively trapped within the cabin.  During soak periods, this heat gain builds, increasing the 
temperature of the cabin air as well as that of all components inside the cabin (i.e. the thermal 
mass).  By venting this  heated cabin air to the outside of the vehicle and allowing fresh air to 
enter, the heat gain inside the vehicle during soak periods can be reduced.  The NREL study 
demonstrated that active cabin ventilation technology, where electric fans are used to pull 
heated air from the cabin, a temperature reduction of 6.9 °C can be realized.  For passive 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-73 
 
ventilation technologies, such as opening of windows and/or sunroofs are and use of floor 
vents to supply fresh air to the cabin (which enhances convective airflow), a cabin air 
temperature reduction of 5.7 °C can be realized.43  Using the EPA estimate for credits due to 
cabin air temperature reductions of 0.3 g/mi for cars 0.4 g/mi for trucks for each degree 
centigrade of temperature reduction, a 6.9 °C reduction due to active cabin ventilation results 
in a credit of 2.1 g/mi for cars and 2.8 g/mi for trucks.  For passive cabin ventilation, a 5.7 °C 
temperature reduction results in a credit of 1.7 g/mi for cars and 2.3 g/mi for trucks. 
5.2.3.6  Summary of Thermal (and Solar) Control Credits 
  The amount of credit that a manufacturer can generate for thermal and solar control 
technologies is shown in Table 5-25.

To earn off-cycle thermal control credits – up to a maximum of 3.0 g/mi for cars, and 
4.3 g/mi for trucks - a vehicle must be equipped with the thermal control technology, in 
accordance with the specifications and definitions in this proposed rulemaking.  If a 
technology meets the specifications, its use in a vehicle will generate credits, in accordance 
with the value set forth in the thermal control technology list. The one exception to a single 
credit value for a technology is glazing technologies, where the method for determining the 
credit is described in section 5.2.3.5.1. 
5.2.3.6.1 Definition and Solar Control Credit Technologies 
Credit for solar control technologies can be generated for MY 2017-2025 vehicles 
which utilize them. In the absence of a performance test to measure the affect of these 
technologies, For all solar control technologies except glazing, EPA will rely on 
manufacturers complying with a specification for, or description of, each technology to assure 
that the emissions reducing benefits are be realized in real-world applications.  Below are the 
descriptions and specifications that EPA is proposing for the solar control technologies listed 
in Table 5-25.  EPA will use these definitions and specifications to determine whether the 
credits are applicable to a vehicle.  
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities

• Active Seat Ventilation – device which draws air from the seating surface 
which is in contact with the occupant and exhausts it to a location away from 
the seat  
• Solar Reflective Paint – vehicle paint or surface coating which reflects at least 
65 percent of the impinging infrared solar energy, as determined using ASTM 
standards E903, E1918-06, or C1549-09 
• Passive Cabin Ventilation – ducts or devices which utilize convective airflow 
to move heated air from the cabin interior to the exterior of the vehicle 
• Active Cabin Ventilation -  devices which mechanically move heated air from 
the cabin interior to the exterior of the vehicle 
EPA is seeking comment on whether these definitions and specifications are adequate 
to ensure that the technologies used to generate credits will result in lower cabin temperatures 
during soak conditions and/or lower A/C-related CO2 emissions. 
5.2.4 Summary of Proposed Credits 
Table 5-26 summarizes the preapproved technologies and off-cycle credits available to 
manufacturers.  If manufacturers wish to receive off-cycle credits for other technologies, they 
must follow the procedures laid out in section III of the Preamble (and in the regulations).  
Any vehicle or family of vehicles receiving credits from this list can receive a maximum of 10 
grams/mile in credits.

is to incentivize the penetration into the marketplace of “game changing” technologies for 
these pickups, including their hybridization.  EPA proposes a credit for manufacturers that 
employ significant quantities of hybridization on full size pickup trucks, by including a per-
vehicle credit available for mild and strong hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).  This provides 
the opportunity to begin to transform the most challenged category of vehicles in terms of the 
penetration of advanced technologies, allowing additional opportunities to successfully 
achieve the higher levels of truck stringencies in MY 2022-2025. 
Access to this credit is conditioned on a minimum penetration of the technology in a 
manufacturer’s full size pickup truck fleet with defined criteria for a full size pickup truck 
(minimum bed size and minimum towing capability).  EPA proposes that mild HEV pickup 
trucks are eligible for a 10 g/mi credit during 2017-2021 if the technology is used on a 
minimum percentage of a company’s full size pickups, beginning with at least 30% of a 
company’s full size pickup production per year in 2017 and ramping up to at least 80% per 
year in 2021.  Strong HEV pickup trucks would be eligible for a 20g/mi credit during 2017-
2025 if the technology is used on at least 10% per year of the company’s full size pickups.

 EPA is also proposing a performance-based incentive credit for full size pickup trucks 
which achieve a significant reduction below the applicable target.  EPA proposes this credit to 
be either 10 g/mi or 20 g/mi for pickups achieving 15% or 20% better CO2 than their target, 
respectively.  Further description of these values is presented in Section 5.3.4 below.   
The performance-based credit will be available for model years 2017 to 2021 for the 
10 g/mi credit and a vehicle meeting the requirements would receive the credit until 2021, or 
until its CO2 level increases.   The 20 g/mi performance-based credit would be available for a 
maximum of 5 consecutive years within the model years of 2017 to 2025, provided its CO2 
level does not increase. Minimum per year penetration rates are defined in Table 5-27, above.

Unlike the hybrid credit, this performance-based credit has no technology or design 
requirements.  Automakers can use any technology as long as the vehicle’s CO2 performance 
is at least 15% or 20% below its footprint-based target.  A vehicle cannot receive both the 
HEV and performance-based credit. 
5.3.1 Pick-up Truck Definition 
For the purposes of the full size pickup truck hybrid technology incentive credit or the 
full size pickup truck performance-based incentive credit, to be considered as eligible for the 
credit, a vehicle is a full size pickup truck if it meets the requirements specified in item 1 and 
2 below, as well as either item 3 or 4. 
1. The vehicle must have an open cargo box with a minimum width between the 
wheelhouses of 48 inches measured as the minimum lateral distance between the 
limiting interferences (pass-through) of the wheelhouses. The measurement would 
exclude the transitional arc, local protrusions, and depressions or pockets, if 
present.q An open cargo box means a vehicle where the cargo bed does not have a 
permanent roof.  Vehicles sold with detachable covers are considered “open” for 
the purposes of these criteria. 
2. Minimum open cargo box length of 60 inches defined by the lesser of the pickup 
bed length at the top of the body (defined as the longitudinal distance from the 
inside front of the pickup bed to the inside of the closed endgate; this would be 
measured at the height of the top of the open pickup bed along vehicle centerline 
and the pickup bed length at the floor) and the pickup bed length at the floor 
(defined as the longitudinal distance from the inside front of the pickup bed to the 
inside of the closed endgate; this would be measured at the cargo floor surface 
along vehicle centerline).r  
3. Minimum Towing Capability – the vehicle must have a GCWR (gross combined 
weight rating) minus GVWR (gross vehicle weight rating) value of at least 5,000 
pounds.s

s
 Gross combined weight rating means the value specified by the vehicle manufacturer as the maximum weight 
of a loaded vehicle and trailer, consistent with good engineering judgment.  Gross vehicle weight rating means 
the value specified by the vehicle manufacturer as the maximum design loaded weight of a single vehicle, 
consistent with good engineering judgment.  Curb weight is defined in 40 CFR 86.1803, consistent with the 
provisions of 40 CFR 1037.140.

4. Minimum Payload Capability – the vehicle must have a GVWR (gross vehicle 
weight rating) minus curb weight value of at least 1,700 pounds. 
EPA is seeking comment on expanding the definition of a full-size truck by reducing 
the minimum wheelhouse width requirement from 48 inches to a value around 42 inches, 
provided the vehicle is able to tow at least 6,000 lbs.  Note that this is 1,000 lbs higher than 
requirement 3, above. 
5.3.2 Hybrid Pickup Technology 
5.3.2.1 Mild Hybrid Pickup Technology 
Mild hybrid pickup trucks are those trucks that meet the definition of a full-size 
pickup, in Section 5.3.1 above and have a powertrain with lower-power hybrid technology.  
Often, a mild hybrid is characterized by the addition of a belt-driven starter-alternator of 
higher power capacity than a standard alternator.  The drive belt system also typically has a 
feature that enables the belt tension to be maintained at proper levels during generator 
operation as well as when the starter-alternator is used to start the engine.  Alternatively, an 
axial motor can be mounted on the crankshaft, usually in the bell housing before the 
transmission.  This motor can be directly attached to the engine, or can be clutched to 
decouple it from the engine.  The vehicle uses a conventional transmission such as an 
automatic, manual, CVT, or DCT with an appropriate conventional coupling such as a torque 
converter or clutch. 
The battery can be between 36V to over 150V nominal (or more), but generally the 
higher the voltage, the higher the performance of the system.  Most mild hybrid pickups are 
expected to offer at least 100V of battery voltage due to the higher power requirement of 
these heavy vehicles. Mild hybrids are capable of start-stop operation, and regenerative 
braking, but unlike strong hybrids they are not capable of any significant electric-only 
operation. 
Mild hybrids are less capable than strong hybrids because of lower power capability, 
but mild hybrids are lower cost and may be easier to adapt to some vehicles without making 
major powertrain, chassis or body changes.  EPA and NHTSA did not model mild hybrid 
pickups for the NPRM, but intends to include them in the modeling for the final rule. 
5.3.2.2 Strong Hybrid Pickup Technology 
Strong hybrid pickups are vehicles that meet the definition of a full-size pickup in 
Section 5.3.1 above and have hybrid systems that are more capable than mild hybrid systems.  
Strong hybrids generally have an integrated transmission-drive motor system with a large, 
powerful electric drive motor-generator (often two motors). The transmission usually is 
specifically designed to integrate the motor-generator(s) and often the coupling between the 
engine and transmission such as a torque converter is removed with its functions handled by 
the electric drive motor system.  The transmission can also be replaced by a power split 
device that uses a planetary gearset and two motor-generators. Strong hybrids typically have 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-78 
 
high voltage battery packs over 300 V to provide the high power necessary for their increased 
capability. 
Strong hybrids are capable of start-stop operation, have significant braking 
regeneration capability and are often capable of driving exclusively on battery power up to 
35-45 mph.  They are also capable of launching the vehicle on electric drive alone, although 
they typically cannot accelerate above 15-20 mph while operating on electric drive 
exclusively. 
5.3.3 Mild and Strong HEV Pickup Truck Definitions 
 A vehicle that meets the definition of a full-size truck above, must meet additional 
design and performance requirements to be eligible for the hybrid full-size truck incentive.  
Mild and strong hybrids are both characterized by stop-start capability and regenerative 
braking and eligible vehicles for this incentive must have both features.  Additionally, the 
level of hybridization (mild or strong) is characterized by the amount of energy recovered 
during regenerative braking.  The methodology for determining the amount of recovered 
braking energy is discussed below. 
Table 5-28: Requirements for Full-Size Pickup Hybridization Incentive 
 
Hybrid Type Mild Hybrid Strong Hybrid 
Stop-Start Yes Yes 
Regenerative Braking Yes Yes 
Amount of Recovered Energy 15% -75% 75% 
5.3.3.1 Measurement of Recovered Braking Energy 
EPA proposes to incorporate a metric – the total percentage of available vehicle 
braking energy recovered over the test cycle – as a way to define levels of hybrid vehicles.  
For a given vehicle and road load profile (characterized by ETW and A, B and C dyno test 
“coastdown” coefficients), a theoretical amount of required braking energy can be calculated 
over the city and highway test cycles.  This maximum braking energy is the sum of the extra 
braking force needed to slow the vehicle enough to follow the test cycle trace upon 
decelerations.   Hybrids recapture a portion of this energy by driving the electric motor (in 
reverse) as a generator, which ultimately provides electrical power to the battery pack.  
Depending on the level of hybridization, this amount of recaptured energy can range between 
Air Conditioning, Off-Cycle Credits, and Other Flexibilities 
5-79 
 
a few percent of total available braking energy up to theoretically almost 100% of all braking 
energy.   
This metric is a way to simplify the characterization of a hybrid as a “mild” or 
“strong” hybrid.  Batteries and motors must increase in scale to recover braking energy at a 
greater rate.  As the power rating of the motor and battery increases, a greater percentage of 
braking energy can be recovered on rapid decelerations.  So, all components of a hybrid 
system – the battery pack size and power rating, the motor rating, etc. – are implicitly 
reflected in the percentage of braking energy recovered.   
The procedure involves calculating the available braking energy on the FTP city cycle 
using the equation derived below.  This value is compared to the actual energy recovered by 
the vehicle during FTP city cycle testing.  Since energy into and out of the hybrid drive 
system battery is a standard part of emissions testing of hybrid vehicles, this procedure 
introduces no additional test burden. However, energy flow into the battery must be separated 
from the sum of energy into and out of the battery which is typically less than 1% of total fuel 
energy used during the test. 
The measured energy into the battery is divided into the total calculated braking 
energy to determine if the vehicle is a mild or strong hybrid.  For a mild hybrid, the recovered 
energy must be greater than 15% and less than 75% of the calculated available braking 
energy.  For a strong hybrid, the recovered braking energy must be greater than 75% of the 
calculated available braking energy.

5.3.4 Performance Based Pickup Truck Incentive Credit Thresholds 
This section describes how the agencies arrived at the proposed threshold values of 
15% and 20% better than the footprint target for the qualification of performance based 
pickup truck incentive credits.  The basis for the credit is to provide an incentive for 
conventional (non-hybrid) pickup trucks to significantly outperform their footprint based 
standard (or target) much as the HEV technologies are expected to do.   
Based on the lumped parameter model (described in Chapter 3 of this joint TSD) 
HEVs on pickup trucks are approximately 15% more effective than non-hybrids.  However 
this is dependent on a great many factors so there is a range of improvement that an HEV can 
exhibit, dependent on the weight, electrification level, HEV architecture, engine/transmission, 
utility ratings, control strategy, etc.  Rather than comparing directly to a given HEV 
technology, we have instead determined the thresholds based on the year-on-year stringency 
of the standards (targets).  We use the GHG standards for illustrative purposes, though the 
exercise could have also been conducted using the fuel economy targets.   
The targets (curve standards at a given footprint) become more stringent each year.  
However the typical vehicle is redesigned every 5 (or 6 years for some larger trucks).  When a 
vehicle is redesigned, it is assumed that the emissions will not just meet the footprint target, 
rather it should exceed it so that in general it is generating credits for the first two or three 
years of the product life, and generating credit deficits for the latter two or three years, until 
the next redesign.  While it is true that any given vehicle is not required to meet its footprint 
target, any given manufacturer must meet its fleet obligation which is based on the footprint 
and sales volumes of the vehicles it produces.  Therefore, under normal (business-as-usual) 
circumstances, each manufacturer will be designing and redesigning some of their vehicle 
models each year and some vehicles will exceed their targets (for about 2-3 years each) and 
others will fall short (for about 2-3 years each), thus allowing the manufacturer to average 
their fleet in order to come into compliance on any given year.  This product development 
“cadence” is an important element of understanding lead time, technology phase-in caps, 
manufacturer capital investments, and the performance based thresholds.   
In the following hypothetical example, illustrated in Figure 5-13, a recently redesigned 
58 square foot pickup truck is certified in MY 2018.  Its target is 308 g/mi.  This truck will 
not receive another redesign until 2022.  Under normal circumstances, a typical vehicle would 
likely be 10% better than the standard, which would make it a credit generator for three years 
and a deficit generator for two years (consistent with the usual regulatory strategy outlined in 
the previous paragraph).  At 15% below target (262 g/mi) this truck will generate credits for 
four years and deficits only in its last year.  At 20% below target (246 g/mi) the truck will 
generate credits for the full five year product development cycle.

Figure 5-13. 2017-2025 Truck GHG Standard Curves, with Example Redesign of a 58 sq. foot truck 
 
The analysis depends somewhat on the footprint selected.  Table 5-29 shows the truck 
footprint targets for each model year for three sample trucks with footprints: 58, 67 and 74 sq 
ft, and three scenarios: 10%, 15% and 20% better than the standard.  The table also shows (on 
the right) the number of years for each of the sample trucks before they start generating 
deficits.  In the 10% scenario, the trucks create deficits in 3.4 years on average.  In the 15%, it 
takes 4.7 years and for 20% it takes 5.7 years on average.   Based on this analysis, the 
agencies have chosen to propose the 15% and 20% threshold as these are significantly better 
than the business-as-usual (~10%) scenario.  The performance thresholds of 15% and 20% 
therefore represent CO2 reductions greater than what EPA expects companies would typically 
plan for during a redesign of these products, given the level of the proposed standards and the 
CO2 targets for typical full size pickup trucks.  These levels are also technically within reach 
of the companies if they pull ahead technologies which they may not otherwise need until the 
later years of the program, or in the case of the later years of the program, a pull-ahead of 
technologies beyond what is needed for MY2025.
