However, several recent prospective epidemiological studies have found concurrent blood lead level (i.e., blood lead measured at the same time as school age IQ) or lifetime average blood lead level (i.e., a mean of blood lead level from infancy to measurement of school age IQ) to be more strongly associated with school age IQ and other measures of neurodevelopment (Canfield et al., 2003; Dietrich et al, 1993; Tong et al. 1996, Wasserman et al., 2000). In addition, a large, international meta-analysis by Lanphear et al. (2005) included four measures of blood lead level: concurrent, peak, lifetime average, and early childhood. The authors found that the concurrent and lifetime blood lead levels were the strongest predictors of IQ deficits associated with lead exposure. A study by Chen et al.

Therefore, we did not incorporate a threshold in our analysis. Many epidemiological studies examining the link between blood lead level and children’s IQ have found an inverse relationship (i.e., increases in blood lead levels are associated with decreases in children’s IQ), with more potent effects occurring at lower blood lead levels (e.g., Lanphear et al., 2005; Canfield et al., 2003). The Workgroup of the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that overall, the weight of available evidence supports an inverse association between blood lead levels and cognitive function in children in the low range of blood lead levels (i.e., below 10 μg/dl) (CDC, 2005). The CDC workgroup document also indicates that, “[a] steeper slope in the dose-response curve was observed at lower rather than higher [blood lead levels] BLLs” (page iv of the Appendix).

We also assessed the sensitivity of the IQ benefits to the epidemiological study selected, using alternative estimates from a meta-analysis of seven studies (Schwartz, 1993) and a study of 172 children in Rochester, New York (Canfield et al, 2003). The Schwartz study calculated an 5-25 overall estimate by linearizing coefficients from included studies that used natural logarithms of lead as the exposure index. Regression coefficients for studies with untransformed blood lead levels were used directly. The Schwartz analysis found a decrease of 0.25 IQ points per 1 μg/dl increase in blood lead level. Using a linear model between lifetime blood lead level and IQ score, Canfield et al. (2003) found a decrement of 0.46 IQ points per 1 μg/dl increase in blood lead level.

We found the benefits to decrease by as much as 74 percent when an alternate estimate from a paper by Schwartz (1993) is used. This is due in part to the underlying shape of the dose-response relationship assumed by each of the functions. In the Lanphear study, a log-linear relationship was found to be the best fit for the data (i.e., the natural logtransformed blood lead level is used to predict changes in IQ score). This model implies that the magnitude of changes in IQ increases with lower blood lead 5-39 levels. However, in the Schwartz (1993) and Canfield et al. (2003) studies, a single linear model is assumed (i.e., untransformed blood lead levels are used to predict changes in IQ score). The single linear model implies that the magnitude of change in IQ is constant over the entire range of blood lead levels. Therefore, at lower blood lead levels, the log-linear model predicts larger changes in IQ than the linear model. Note that CASAC, in their review of EPA’s Lead Risk Assessment indicated that “studies show that the decrements in intellectual (cognitive) functions in children are proportionately greater at PbB concentrations &amp;lt;10 μg/dl” (USEPA, 2007d, pa</context>

More recently, a study of changes in children’s blood Pb levels associated with reduced Pb emissions and associated air concentrations near a Pb smelter in Canada (for children through age six in age) reports a ratio of 1:6 and additional analysis of the data by EPA for the initial time period of the study resulted in a ratio of 1:7 (CD, pp. 3-23 to 3-24; Hilts, 2003).57 Ambient air and blood Pb levels associated with the Hilts (2003) study range from 1.1 to 0.03 µg/m3, and associated population mean blood Pb levels range from 11.5 to 4.7 µg/dL, which are lower than levels associated with the older studies cited in the 1986 Criteria Document (USEPA, 1986).

However, several recent prospective epidemiological studies have found concurrent blood lead level (i.e., blood lead measured at the same time as school age IQ) or lifetime average blood lead level (i.e., a mean of blood lead level from infancy to measurement of school age IQ) to be more strongly associated with school age IQ and other measures of neurodevelopment (Canfield et al., 2003; Dietrich et al, 1993; Tong et al. 1996, Wasserman et al., 2000). In addition, a large, international meta-analysis by Lanphear et al. (2005) included four measures of blood lead level: concurrent, peak, lifetime average, and early childhood. The authors found that the concurrent and lifetime blood lead levels were the strongest predictors of IQ deficits associated with lead exposure. A study by Chen et al. (2005) specifically evaluated whether a window of enhanced susceptibility to lead exists. This study examined whether cross-sectional associations observed in school age children represent residual effects from two years of age or “new” effects emerging among these children (USEPA, 2006a). Chen et al. found that the blood lead m</context>

Therefore, we did not incorporate a threshold in our analysis. Many epidemiological studies examining the link between blood lead level and children’s IQ have found an inverse relationship (i.e., increases in blood lead levels are associated with decreases in children’s IQ), with more potent effects occurring at lower blood lead levels (e.g., Lanphear et al., 2005; Canfield et al., 2003). The Workgroup of the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that overall, the weight of available evidence supports an inverse association between blood lead levels and cognitive function in children in the low range of blood lead levels (i.e., below 10 μg/dl) (CDC, 2005). The CDC workgroup document also indicates that, “[a] steeper slope in the dose-response curve was observed at lower rather than higher [blood lead levels] BLLs” (page iv of the Appendix). In addition, EPA’s Integrat</context>

In order to quantify the expected changes in IQ points in the population of children due to the implementation of alternative NAAQS, we utilized available dose-response functions in the literature. For our primary estimate, we selected a dose-response relationship from a pooled analysis of seven prospective studies in North America and Europe examining the effect of lead on full-scale IQ in children (Lanphear et al., 2005).61,62 Blood lead levels were measured in each study five times over early childhood (at 6, 12 (or 15), 36, 48, and 60 months). Full-scale IQ was measured when the children were between 4 and 10 years of age. Four measures of blood lead were examined by the authors: concurrent blood lead (defined as the blood lead measured closest to the IQ test), maximum blood lead (defined as the peak blood lead measured at any time before the IQ test), average lifetime blood lead (defined as the mean blood lead from six months to concurrent blood lead tests), and early childhood blood lead (defined as the m</context>

Lanphear reports an IQ decrement of 6.2 points for an increase in lifetime blood lead level from 6.1 to 47.0 μg/dl for the selected model. However, the lowest measured lifetime blood lead level represented in the Lanphear pooled analysis was 1.47 μg/dl. To estimate IQ effects at blood lead levels below this 61 Full-scale IQ is a composite score of verbal and performance tests. Children were administered a version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children under uniform conditions within each study (Lanphear et al., 2005). 62 The seven cohort studies included in this analysis include sites in Boston, Massachusetts (Bellinger et al., 1992); Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio (Dietrich et al., 1993 and Ernhart et al., 1989); Mexico City, Mexico (Schnaas et al., 2000); Rochester, New York (Canfield et al., 2003); and Yugoslavia (Wasserman et al., 1997). 63 The natural log of the blood lead levels were used for this analysis. 5-24 “cutpoint,” we used a linearized slope, obtained by taking the tangent to the log-linear function at the point of departure (USEPA, 2007a).

When a 7 percent discount rate was used in place of the default rate of 3 percent, results decreased by 88 percent. This is in part because the benefits of lead on earnings occur over a lifetime, and the net present value of those earnings is highly sensitive to the discount rate applied. The dose-response function selected for quantifying the number of IQ points gained as a result of achieving the alternative NAAQS levels affected the results. Utilizing alternate epidemiological studies decreased the primary estimate by as much as 74 percent. However, we believe the Lanphear et al. (2005) study was the best choice for our primary estimate. This study was a meta-analysis that synthesized a range of existing information and is based on more recent data than the studies included in the Schwartz (1993) study. In addition, the log-linear model was the most robust estimate from this study, in that it was the best fit for the data.

For instance, the first three years of life represent the maximal period of lead ingestion as well as a period of time when important development of the central nervous system is occurring, which suggests that biologically, this could be a vulnerable period (USEPA, 2006a). In addition, there are two major meta-analyses that focused on the association between school age IQ and blood lead concentrations at two years of age or average blood lead concentrations up to three 5-10 years of age (Pocock et al, 1994; Schwartz, 1994a).

These PM2.5 benefit-per-ton estimates provide the total monetized human health benefits (the sum of premature mortality and premature morbidity) of reducing one ton of PM2.5 from a specified source. EPA has used a similar technique in previous RIAs, including the recent ozone NAAQS RIA (USEPA, 2008a). The fourteen estimates presented below derive from the application of three alternative methods: · One estimate is based on the concentration-response (C-R) function developed from a study of the American Cancer Society (ACS) cohort reported in Pope et al. (2002), which has previously been reported as the primary estimate in recent RIAs (USEPA, 2006c). · One estimate is based on Laden et al.’s (2006) reporting of the extended Six Cities cohort study; this study is a more recent PM epidemiological study that was used as an alternative in the PM NAAQS RIA. 5-34 · The other twelve estimates are based on the results of EPA&apos;s expert elicitation study on the PM-mortality relationship, as first reported in Industrial Economics (2006) and interpreted for benefits analysis in EPA&apos;s final RIA for the PM NAAQS, published in September 2006 (USEPA, 2006c).

As in EPA’s Economic Analysis for the Renovation, Repair, and Painting Program Proposed Rule (EPA, 2008c), we assumed children will be affected by lead at age three, the midpoint of the range during which children are thought to be most susceptible to lead. Therefore, we discounted lifetime earnings back to age three. We estimated present value median lifetime earnings to be $606,930 in 2006 dollars. In the previous EPA analyses cited above, the Agency has applied an average estimate of the effect of IQ on earnings of 2.379 percent per IQ point from an analysis by Salkever (1995).66 An analysis by Schwartz (1994b) estimated that a 1-point increase in IQ would increase earnings by 1.76 percent. The percentage increases in both studies reflect both direct impact of IQ on hourly wages and indirect effects on annual earnings as the result of additional schooling and increased labor force participation. A recent review of literature from the labor economics and environmental health fields by CDC economist Scott Grosse suggests that both of these studies may have overestimated the association of IQ with earnings (2007). Specifically, he found the Salkever estimate of direct</context>
<context position="255004" citStr="Salkever (1995)" startWordPosition="38050" endWordPosition="38051"> total effect of lead on earnings, because it includes the effects of lead on education and earnings that result from both cognitive and non-cognitive changes. Thus, it may be a more comprehensive estimate than one based on cognitive changes alone. 64 See http://www.bls.gov/cps/home.htm - data. 65 See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_14.pdf. 66 The 812 Retrospective analysis also included an estimate based on older work by Needleman et al. (1990). 5-28 In recognition of the fact that the economics literature continues to evolve, and because EPA has traditionally relied upon the Salkever (1995) estimate to value changes in IQ, for this analysis we provide a range of valuation estimates based on both the Salkever (1995) and the Schwartz (1994b) functions. Below we describe how we estimate the cost per IQ decrement using each function. The 1.76 percent estimate from Schwartz represents a gross impact on earnings; it does not account for the costs of additional schooling. EPA’s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) RIA (USEPA, 2005) reported an estimate of $16,425 per additional year of schooling in 1992 dollars, based on U.S. Department of Education data reflecting both direct annual expendit</context>
<context position="256807" citStr="Salkever (1995)" startWordPosition="38357" endWordPosition="38358">oling per IQ point (1994b); thus the change in average education costs per IQ point is $14,700 ´ 0.131 = $1,930. Using the Schwartz function, we calculated the present value of the median net earnings loss associated with one IQ point as the present value of median lost earnings per IQ point lost ($606,930 ´ 0.0176 = $10,682) minus the change in average education costs per IQ point ($1,930). These calculations yield a value of $8,760 of net earnings lost per a one-point decrease in IQ using a 3% discount rate and a value of $1,094 at a 7% discount rate. To estimate the cost per IQ point using Salkever (1995), we followed the same set of steps as above, substituting the Salkever estimate of the change in lifetime earnings. These calculations yield a value of $12,512 of net earnings lost per a one point decrease in IQ using a 3% discount rate and a value of $2,156 at a 7% discount rate. 5.10 Results This section presents the health effects results and the associated monetary benefits. We first present the expected IQ point gains in 2020, comparing each of the “control scenarios” to the “base case.” We then provide the expected monetized value of those gains in IQ in 2020.

Children were administered a version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children under uniform conditions within each study (Lanphear et al., 2005). 62 The seven cohort studies included in this analysis include sites in Boston, Massachusetts (Bellinger et al., 1992); Cincinnati and Cleveland, Ohio (Dietrich et al., 1993 and Ernhart et al., 1989); Mexico City, Mexico (Schnaas et al., 2000); Rochester, New York (Canfield et al., 2003); and Yugoslavia (Wasserman et al., 1997). 63 The natural log of the blood lead levels were used for this analysis. 5-24 “cutpoint,” we used a linearized slope, obtained by taking the tangent to the log-linear function at the point of departure (USEPA, 2007a).

Certain adult health impact functions, such as those quantifying the relationship between blood lead and diastolic blood pressure (Nawrot, 2002) are current. However, the functions relating changes in blood pressure to changes in premature mortality, chronic heart disease and stroke were each drawn from studies published in the 1970’s; advances in the treatment of high blood pressure suggest that these functions may over-predict of changes in these health effects in the current population. One newer study, Schober et al. (2006), quantifies the relationship between blood lead and cardiovascular mortality. However, according to the Lead Criteria Document, “…until the Schober et al. findings are replicated and more fully understood, the Schober et al. (2006) estimates for Pb-induced cardiovascular mortality should probably not be used for quantitative risk assessment” USEPA, 2006a, page 8-89.

For instance, the first three years of life represent the maximal period of lead ingestion as well as a period of time when important development of the central nervous system is occurring, which suggests that biologically, this could be a vulnerable period (USEPA, 2006a). In addition, there are two major meta-analyses that focused on the association between school age IQ and blood lead concentrations at two years of age or average blood lead concentrations up to three 5-10 years of age (Pocock et al, 1994; Schwartz, 1994a). However, several recent prospective epidemiological studies have found concurrent blood lead level (i.e., blood lead measured at the same time as school age IQ) or lifetime average blood lead level (i.e., a mean of blood lead level from infancy to measurement of school age IQ) to be more strongly associated with school age IQ and other measures of neurodevelopment (Canfield et al., 2003; Dietrich et al, 1993; Tong et al. 1996, Wasserman et al., 2000).

In the previous EPA analyses cited above, the Agency has applied an average estimate of the effect of IQ on earnings of 2.379 percent per IQ point from an analysis by Salkever (1995).66 An analysis by Schwartz (1994b) estimated that a 1-point increase in IQ would increase earnings by 1.76 percent. The percentage increases in both studies reflect both direct impact of IQ on hourly wages and indirect effects on annual earnings as the result of additional schooling and increased labor force participation.

The 1.76 percent estimate from Schwartz represents a gross impact on earnings; it does not account for the costs of additional schooling.

However, several recent prospective epidemiological studies have found concurrent blood lead level (i.e., blood lead measured at the same time as school age IQ) or lifetime average blood lead level (i.e., a mean of blood lead level from infancy to measurement of school age IQ) to be more strongly associated with school age IQ and other measures of neurodevelopment (Canfield et al., 2003; Dietrich et al, 1993; Tong et al. 1996, Wasserman et al., 2000). In addition, a large, international meta-analysis by Lanphear et al. (2005) included four measures of blood lead level: concurrent, peak, lifetime average, and early childhood. The authors found that the concurrent and lifetime blood lead levels were the strongest predictors of IQ deficits associated with lead exposure. A study by Chen et al. (2005) specifically evaluated whether a window of enhanced susceptibility to lead exists. This study examined whether cross-sectional associations observed in school age children represent residual effects from two years of age or “new” effects emerging</context>
