Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This proposed rule has been designated an “economically” significant rule, under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, the proposed rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. Using the Small Business Administration (SBA) definition of small vending machine operators as classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS 45421), FDA estimates that a significant number of operators impacted by this proposed rule are small businesses. As directed by statute, the requirements of the</context>

Conversely, approximately 72 percent of industry revenue--and thus a comparably large fraction of 8 consumption--comes from firms with more than $10 million in annual sales, and 85 percent comes from firms with more than $5 million in revenue (Ref. 1). Vending machine operators together operate an estimated 5 to 7 million machines (Refs. 1 and 2) in at least 1.5 million locations (Ref. 1). Approximately 70 percent of these machines sell packaged food, including beverages, that are required to bear nutrition labeling under section 403(q)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA regulations at § 101.9, and thus have Nutrition Facts. This 70 percent is comprised mostly of packaged beverage machines, which account for more than 50 percent of all vending machines, with the remainder--approximately 20 percent of all machines-- selling packaged confections or snacks. Ten percent sell a variety of hot and cold cup beverages, frozen or fresh food products and miscellaneous other food products. The final 20 percent of machines are bulk candy, nut or gum machines that are not covered by section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii) and the proposed requirements because t</context>

Regulatory Options In addition to a baseline, FDA has identified four regulatory options for this proposed rule. The costs and benefits of these options are summarized in table 1b of this document. (0) Baseline for the purpose of analysis--No new Federal regulatory action. (1) Option 1, the proposed rule, allowing a sign in close proximity to the article of food or selection button, i.e. in, on, or adjacent to the vending machine, but not necessarily attached to the vending machine, so long as the sign is visible at the same time as the food, its name, price, or selection number is visible, and with an effective date of 1 year after publication of the final rule. (2) Option 2, similar to the proposed rule, but requiring that calorie declarations be immediately adjacent to the article of food or selection button for all calorie disclosures. For this option, FDA esti</context>

If this were to occur, in the absence of the enactment of section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act, costs to industry could be several times the cost of this proposed rule, and the benefit to consumers may be lower because of incomplete coverage and fragmented presentation of nutrition information. B. Option 1: Proposed Rule Under this option FDA proposes the following requirements for the placement of calorie declarations for covered vending machine food: (A) This calorie information may be placed (1) On a sign in close proximity to each article of food in the vending machine or the selection button or (2) On a sign, such as a poster in, on, or adjacent to the vending machine, but not necessarily attached to the vending machine, so long as the sign is visible at the same time as the food, its description name, price, or selection button number is visible.

Therefore, vending machine operators that operate glass front machines, or other kinds of vending machines that displays food products with visible nutrition information would not have to provide the calorie information described in section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii)(I) of the FD&amp;C Act and § 101.8(c)(2)of this proposed rule. In other cases, operators may not need to comply with the proposed requirements by placing the products in a way that permits the consumer to examine the Nutrition Facts Panels for the products prior to purchase. In addition, the increased use of electronic displays on vending machines will reduce the need for physical signs. As a conservative estimate, with between 4 million and 5.6 million machines, FDA estimates that the sign cost will between $4 million and $5.6 million annually.

While these bulk machines form a large percentage of vending machines, they account for less than 0.5 percent of vending machine sales (Ref. 2). Summary of costs and benefits of the proposed rule and regulatory options. In this section we briefly summarize the costs and benefits of the proposed rule that are analyzed in the detailed PRIA. These estimates are collected in table 1. Costs of complying with the proposed requirements have been estimated for three major areas: Cost of nutrition analysis, cost of new signs o</context>

II. Costs and Benefits of Regulatory Options: Detailed Analysis This section describes the costs and benefits for the proposed rule and the regulatory options. A. Baseline No New Regulatory Action Imposing no new nutrition labeling requirements for covered vending machine food is the baseline for our analysis. Section 4205 of the Affordable Care Act requires that FDA issue regulations to carry out section 403(q)(5)(H) of the FD&amp;C Act, which includes nutrition labeling requirements for covered vending machine food. Therefore, this is not a legally viable option. However, OMB cost-benefit analysis guidelines recommend discussing statutory requirements that affect the selection of regulatory approaches. These guidelines also recommend analyzing the opportunity cost of legal constraints that prevent the selection of the regulatory action that best satisfies the philosophy and principles of the Executive Order 12866. This option will serve as the baseline against which other options will be measured for asse</context>

(C) Where the vending machine only displays a vignette or name of the food item, the calorie information must be in close proximity to the vignette or name or in close proximity to the selection button. 14 (D) For electronic vending machines (e.g., machines with digital or electronic or LCD displays), the calorie information may be displayed when the selection numbers are entered but before the selection is confirmed. For vending machine operators that are not subject to the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(H) of the FD&amp;C Act, the proposed rule specifies the terms and conditions for how these operators can voluntarily become subject to the proposed requirements by registering with FDA. Because this registration is voluntary, only operators that see a positive net benefit to themselves will choose to register, therefore, FDA estimates that the registration provision by itself will have no net cost. i. Costs. In order to comply with the proposed rule, each affected operator will need to have or acquire calorie content data for its covered vending machine food. Because almost all vending machines s</context>
<context position="37528" citStr="(5)" startWordPosition="5770" endWordPosition="5770">initially, choose to include calorie information on signs, including posters adjacent to vending machines. In the long run, the manufacturers of vending machines, and the larger vending machine operators, such as the soft drink companies, may use more integrated signs, and thus more expensive, methods as part of regular updates and replacement of machines. 18 If total calories were included on the label for a food sold from a vending machine and the calorie information met the requirements for visible, , that food would not be subject to the nutrition labeling requirements under section 403(q)(5)(H)(viii)(I) of the FD&amp;C Act.
