This proposal is necessary because EPA expects soon to promulgate regulations under the CAA to control GHG emissions and, as a result, trigger PSD and title V applicability requirements for GHG emissions. If PSD and title V requirements apply at the applicability levels provided under the CAA, State permitting authorities would be paralyzed by permit applications in numbers that are orders of magnitude greater than their current administrative resources could accommodate. On the basis of the legal doctrines of ‘‘absurd results’’ and ‘‘administrative necessity,’’ this proposed rule would phase in the applicability thresholds for both the PSD and title V programs for sources of GHG emissions. The first phase, which would last 6 years, would establish a temporary level for the PSD and title V applicability thresholds at 25,000 tons per year (tpy), on a ‘‘carbon dioxide equivalent’’ (CO2e) basis, and a temporary PSD significance level for GHG emissions of between 10,000 and 25,000 tpy CO2e.

This NPRM also proposes to require a lap/shoulder belt for the motorcoach and large school bus driver’s seating positions, which currently are required to have either a lap or a lap/shoulder belt. Although motorcoach transportation overall is a safe form of transportation in the United States, several motorcoach crashes in 2008 have illustrated that motorcoach rollover crashes, while a relatively rare event, can cause a significant number of fatal or serious injuries in a single event. NHTSA’s safety research on motorcoach seat belts, completed in 2009, shows that the installation of lap/shoulder belts on motorcoaches is practicable and effective. We believe that the seat belt assemblies that would be installed on motorcoach passenger seats pursuant to this rulemaking could reduce the risk of fatal injuries in rollover crashes by 77 percent, primarily by preventing occupant ejection in a crash.",No,,Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Electronic Stability Control Systems for Heavy Vehicles,2127-AK97,,Proposed Rule,RIAMetaChelsea,1,23-May-12,Department of Transportation,N/A,N/A,,48,48,48,47,http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=NHTSA-2012-0065,Daimler-Benz; American Trucking Association; Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems; Robert Bosch LLC; Meritor WABCO; National School Transportation Association; National Ready Mixed Concrete Association; Engine Manufacturers Association; National Association for Pupil Transportation; Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association; George Mason University; Navistar Inc; American Highway Users Alliance; Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance,2100,"Regulation establishes a new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No.136 to require electronic stability control (ESC) systems on truck tractors and certain buses with a gross vehicle weight rating of greater than 11,793 kilograms (26,000 pounds).

Previous rulemaking may have identified various reasons used to justify PTC regulations, but there is no mention made in this economic analysis. There is also no mention that the agency may have made a mistake, as this proposed regulation represents a lessening of a previous government rulemaking.
