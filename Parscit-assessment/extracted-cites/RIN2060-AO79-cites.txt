Landfills, pulp and paper manufacturing, and suppliers of coal-based products each represent between 5% and 10% of national costs. All other sectors account for less than 5% of national costs. In subsequent years, the overall distribution is similar, although the costs and shares of EPA; EPA will use the information to verify the data. 7.4.6.2 Scenarios Evaluated EPA developed alternative reporting scenarios and assessed the costs and emissions associated with each. Alternative scenarios were developed by creating the recommended scenario (the recommended option for each dimension, as shown in Table 3-1), then varying the levels in one dimension while keeping the other three dimensions at the recommended options. The alternative reporting scenarios evaluated are listed below: 1. A 1,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and verifier. 7-11 2. A 10,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and verifier. 3. A 100,000 tCO2e threshold; recommended options for methodology, frequency, and verifier. 4. The measurement variable is changed to direct measurement; recommended option for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 5. The measurement variable is changed to default emissions factors; recommended option for threshold, frequency, and verifier. 6. Existing federal data used for measurement of fuel suppliers; recommended option for threshold, frequency, verifier, and methodology for other sources. 7.

<rawString>10. Reporting from upstream sources only; recommended option for methodology, 7.9 National Technology Transfer Advancement Act Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law No. 104-113 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical. Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, with explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. This proposed rulemaking involves technical standards. EPA proposes to use more than 40 voluntary consensus standards from six different voluntary consensus standards bodies: American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Gas Processors Association (GPA), American Gas Association (AGA), and American Petroleum Institute (API).
