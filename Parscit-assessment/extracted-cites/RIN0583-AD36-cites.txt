In these States, the Ictaluridae catfish industry generates an economic impact of billions of dollars and is the primary source of economic activity and employment in a number of counties. For example, the domestic Ictaluridae catfish industry in Chicot County, Arkansas, alone, generated a total economic impact of $359 million, $20 million in total tax revenue, and 2,534 jobs (46% of all employment in the county) when all direct, indirect, and induced effects were accounted for (Kaliba and Engle, 2004). The overall impact of this domestic industry is even greater because it is concentrated in a region of the country that is characterized by low levels of economic development and high rates of unemployment. The southern United States has a transportation and communications infrastructure that facilitates transportation of catfish feeds from feed mills to catfish farms, fingerlings from fingerling producers to food catfish production facilities, food catfish from production facilities to processing establishments, and miscellaneous equipment and supplies to catfish farms.

The remaining 12 processing establishments run their own catching and hauling crews using approximately 5 trucks per establishment or a total of about 60 water-tankard trucks. Commercial domestic Ictaluridae catfish are typically produced in controlled aquatic environments (e.g., ponds, and cages placed in lakes or rivers); seined harvested; transported or hauled alive in super-oxygenated water, sometimes water cooled in transit; and delivered live to a processing establishment often within several hours of being seined (Silva, 2001). In addition, Ictaluridae catfish can arrive at the processing establishment within an hour of where they are raised. Furthermore, the domestic Ictaluridae industry already has mandatory HACCP quality assurance programs. Further, a large share of the industry conducts third party audits of their catfish and catfish products processing practices. Domestic and foreign raised Siluriformes catfish and catfish products constitute a growing share of total freshwater fish consumption in the U.S., according to the Economic Research Service (ERS, 2008). The Siluriformes catfish share is expected 28 to</context>

Processing, Cooking, and Inspection Domestic Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products are processed by a mix of automated equipment and hand work that: moves the live catfish from receiving; hand sorts out noncatfish; washes the catfish; de-heads the catfish; sorts by sizes; performs evisceration, separation/fabrication of fillets and pieces/nuggets (non-fillets) from the shell (i.e., skeletal bones) of the catfish, and skin removal; hand trims fillets and nuggets to remove tags of skin and bones; conducts chilling by water bath; packages; and blast freezes (Silva, 2001). Fresh catfish and catfish products are chilled to a temperature not to exceed 45ºF prior to additional processing. 41 The FDA regulations require that all Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products processed and distributed for consumption be chilled or frozen, or be shelf stable (cooked, smoked or dried) (FDA, 1994). In addition, processing areas need to be at 45 degrees or less (FDA, 1994). Because of the diversity of the domestic Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products industry, there are numerous &amp;quot;systems&amp;quot; by which Ictaluridae catfish production and Ictaluridae catfish and catf</context>

FDA and NOAA/NMFS inspection program personnel are responsible for observing the cleanliness, type, and wholesomeness of raw materials and finished products, the handling of ingredients, packaging, labeling, freezing, storing, and all other operations related to the processing and production of catfish and catfish products. In those establishments that contract for NOAA/NMFS services, inspection program personnel are required to be on duty whenever catfish and catfish food products are processed; or packaged; and catfish and catfish food products are received or shipped (Silva, 2001). According to FSIS discussions with industry experts, about 18 slaughtering and processing establishments annually pay the NMFS approximately $1.3 million for inspection services and certifications. These establishments provide office and locker space for NMFS inspection program personnel. 6. HACCP Plans and Third Party Audits FSIS discussions with catfish experts of the catfish trade organizations found that about 16, or 70 percent, of the 23 slaughtering and processing establishments are subject to, at a minimum, an annual review by buyers or representatives of buyers for the verification o</context>

The hourly wage rates used in the cost analysis are as follows: Quality Control (QC) manager--$34.41; Supervisors or QC technicians--$25.28; and production workers--$18.00. The compensation wage rates used in the analysis are based on those reported for employees at meat and poultry processing establishments in the PR/HACCP final rule. The rates are updated using the Employment Cost Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, 2010). The compensation rates include 33 percent overhead for employee benefits. 55 B. Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures Additional Domestic Costs The proposal requires that each establishment have a developed and implemented written sanitation standard operating procedures (SSOP) plan that is specific to its catfish and catfish food products operations. While establishments are now not required to have a SSOP plan, some establishments operate under SSOP plans. FSIS solicits comments on the proportion of catfish and catfish food products establishments that already have SSOP plans. 1. Plan D</context>

The remaining 285, or 17 percent, of 1,724 would be those domestic establishments and importers that would be retail outlet operations that would be exempt from this proposed rule. 25 There are an estimated 1,300 commercial catfish producer farms in the United States that supply live Ictaluridae catfish to about 23 active catfish slaughtering and processing establishments in the United States (USDA NASS, 2009). A NASS survey found 18 catfish processors that can slaughter and process 2,000 pounds live weight or more per 8-hour shift (USDA NASS, 2008). FSIS solicits information on the number and location of active catfish slaughtering and whole catfish and catfish products processing establishments in the United States. In addition, based on FDA inspection data (FDA, 2007), there are about 415 FDA inspected establishments in the United States that are registered to process (e.g., dressing, cutting portions, cooking, drying, or smoking) fish or seafood. Based on discussions with FDA catfish experts, about 190, or 46 percent of these FDA registered establishments are known to have further processed Siluriformes catfish and catfish products w</context>

In addition, Ictaluridae catfish can arrive at the processing establishment within an hour of where they are raised. Furthermore, the domestic Ictaluridae industry already has mandatory HACCP quality assurance programs. Further, a large share of the industry conducts third party audits of their catfish and catfish products processing practices. Domestic and foreign raised Siluriformes catfish and catfish products constitute a growing share of total freshwater fish consumption in the U.S., according to the Economic Research Service (ERS, 2008). The Siluriformes catfish share is expected 28 to grow in response to increased consumer demand or preference for food safety and product innovation. Innovation in Siluriformes catfish products is reflected in the rate of new products entering the market place, including marinated products, breaded products, cooked, dried, or smoked products, shelf-stable products, canned and pouched cooked products, and refrigerated grocery products. Siluriformes catfish by-products include fish meals, and fertilizers. Based on FSIS discussions with industry experts, about 6 domestic Siluriformes catfish and</context>

Siluriformes (Ictaluridae and non-Ictaluridae) catfish and catfish food products include whole catfish, fillets, nuggets, steaks, and various products with or without non-catfish ingredients that are processed, breaded, and cooked into readyto-eat (RTE) food products. Siluriformes catfish and catfish food products may be available in fresh/chilled, frozen, smoked, cooked, marinated, breaded, and dried forms. The volume and variety of Siluriformes catfish and catfish products and other finfish products have increased at the retail level in recent years (ERS, 2008). In 2007, fresh/chilled Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products accounted for less than half, or about 90.7 million pounds, of all, or about 252.4 million pounds, of Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products marketed in the U.S. as finished product in 2007 (NASS, 2008). Frozen Ictaluridae catfish and catfish food products accounted for more than half, or about 161.7 million pounds, of the Ictaluridae sales.

Disease etiology was reported for 3 of the 7 outbreaks identified: 1 outbreak was due to Enterotoxigenic E. coli, ETEC O169:H41, with 41 cases in 2003; 1 was due to a chemical with 2 cases in 2000 but lack of further detail information about the chemical involved; and one was due to Salmonella Hadar with 10 cases in 1991. According to Wyatt et al., (1979) before FDA HACCP regulations were in effect, Salmonella spp. were found in 21% of aquaculture live catfish in 1979 and can be harbored within live catfish for 30 days after exposure to high levels (Ward, 1989). An increased probability of illness is associated with consumption of a variety of anthropogenic chemicals such as pesticides, environmental contaminants, and drugs. Various chemicals have been detected in domestic and imported catfish and catfish products; these compounds represent a potential hazard to consumers. Catfish and catfish products eaten by U.S. consumers are consumed cooked, often deep fried, and minimizing microbiological hazards. However, some catfish steaks or fillets eaten by U.S. consumers are consumed after being cooked by microwave, broiling, or grilling. Microwaving, bro</context>

One way to measure the effects of foodborne illness is to use Quality Adjusted Life 101 Years (QALYs) or Quality Adjusted Life Days (QALDs). This method involves using a weighting system for determining how much less the utility of illness or death is to society or to the individual than the utility of good health. This analysis uses the ERS estimates for medical costs associated with salmonellosis (updated to 2004 dollars) 24 (ERS, 2009) and the FDA weights for QALDs. The medical costs associated with arthritis are from Zorn &amp; Klontz (1998). Applying the same methodology as FDA in projecting a monetary value for each QALD, using the value of a statistical life (VSL); and the value of a statistical life year (VSLY), FSIS projects a mean annualized cost of about $18,000 per new average case of salmonellosis (FDA, 2009). B. Potential Magnitude of Catfish-Related Illnesses As previously noted, CDC data shows that one outbreak was directly attributed to Salmonella Hadar with 10 cases in 1991.
