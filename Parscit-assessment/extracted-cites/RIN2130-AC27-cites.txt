If a particular track segment included in a PTCIP no longer carries PIH traffic, and its PTC system implementation is scheduled, but not yet effectuated, then the host railroad might avoid actual PTC system implementation by filing a supported RFA for FRA approval. Each such RFA must be supported with the data defined under §§ 236.1005(b)(2) and (b)(4)(i), and satisfy the two qualifying tests that were promulgated under FRA’s statutory authority to require PTC to be installed on lines in addition to those required to be equipped by RSIA. If a track segment fails either of these tests, FRA would deny the request, thus requiring PTC system implementation on the line segment. The first test, proverbially known as the “alternative route analysis,” was initially codified at § 236.1005(b)(4)(i)(A), and subsequently moved to a new section, § 236.1020. Under this test, the railroad must establish that current or prospective rerouting to one or more</context>

When FRA issued its PTC rule amendments on September 27, 2010, FRA indicated that it was delaying the effective date of 7 § 236.1005(b)(4)(i)(A)(2)(iii), as revised under § 236.1020, pending the completion of a separate rulemaking to determine how residual risk is to be determined. 2.2 Litigation, Executive Order 13563, and Congressional Hearings After FRA issued its first PTC rule on January 15, 2010, and denied petitions for reconsideration on July 8, 2010, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) filed a petition for review of the rule with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Once FRA issued its PTC final rule amendments, AAR filed a petition for review of those amendments on October 5, 2010. Th</context>

The AAR in its Congressional Testimony testified that (1) 2010 was the safest year for America’s railroads, (2) railroads have lower employee injury rates than most other major industries, (3) only around 4 percent of all train accidents on Class I main lines are likely to be prevented by PTC systems, and (4) there are many far less costly ways to provide greater improvements in rail safety than through the implementation of PTC on lines not required by Congress to be equipped. According to the testimony, if the PTC rule remains unchanged, railroads may have to spend more than $500 million in the next few years to deploy PTC on more than 10,000 miles of rail lines on which neither passenger nor PIH materials will be moving in 2015. Benefits and costs would result from eliminating the requirements to perform these tests on segments to be removed from the mandatory PTC network. In addition to elimin</context>
