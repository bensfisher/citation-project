Although MSHA is using the willingness-to-pay approach as the basis for monetizing the expected benefits of the proposed rule, the Agency does so with several reservations, given the methodological difficulties involved in estimating the compensating wage differentials (see Hintermann, Alberini and Markandya, 2008). Furthermore, these estimates pooled across different industries may not capture the unique circumstances faced by coal miners. For example, some have suggested that VSL models be disaggregated to account for different levels of risk, as might occur in coal mining (see Sunstein, 2004). In addition, coal miners may have few options of alternative employers and in some cases only one employer (near-monopsony or monopsony) that may depress wages below those in a more competitive labor market. MSHA developed the estimates in Table III-4 by multiplying the number of adverse health effects in Tables III-2 and III-3 by the monetized value of each adverse health effect. Table III-4: Estimated Value of Adverse Health Effects Prevented 23 Over a 45-Years1 Work Lifetime (Millions of 2009 Dollars) CWP 1+ CWP 2+ PMF Severe Emphysema Deaths from NMRD Total Benefits Based Upon Table III-</context>

This approach relies on the theory of compensating wage differentials (i.e., the wage 22 premium paid to workers to accept the risk associated with various jobs) in the labor market. A number of studies have shown a correlation between higher job risk and higher wages, suggesting that employees demand monetary compensation in return for incurring a greater risk of illness or fatality. Viscusi &amp; Aldy (2003) conducted an analysis of studies that use a willingness-topay methodology to estimate the imputed value of life-saving programs (i.e., metaanalysis) and found that each fatality avoided was valued at approximately $7 million and each lost work-day injury was approximately $50,000 in 2000 dollars. Using the GDP Deflator (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2010), this yields an estimate of $8.7 million for each fatality avoided and $62,000 for each injury avoided in 2009 dollars. MSHA is using the $8.7 million estimate for the value of a death prevented and $62,000 for each case of CWP 1+ or CWP</context>
