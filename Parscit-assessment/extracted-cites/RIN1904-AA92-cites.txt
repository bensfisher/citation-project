<rawString>54 U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, ‘‘Energy Conservation Program for Commercial and Industrial Equipment: High-Intensity Discharge Lamps Analysis of Potential Energy Savings’’ (Dec. 2004). Available at: http://www1.eere.energy.gov/ buildings/appliance_standards/commercial/pdfs/ hid_energy_savings_report.pdf. align with NEMA’s suggestions, because they incorporate several other phenomena in addition to the migration to T12 electronic systems (e.g., growth rate, emerging technologies, T5 penetration, 8-foot SP slimline to 4-foot MBP conversions). iii. Eight-Foot Single Pin Slimline T12 (Public Meeting Transcript, No. 21 at pp. 254–255; Joint Comment, No. 23 at p. 7) Based on its consideration of the above comments, DOE revised its estimated conversion rates for 8-foot single pin slimline systems in this NOPR. In line with the Joint Comment and NEMA’s recommendations, DOE lowered its conversion rates to 4-foot MBP systems. In addition, consistent with NEMA’s suggestion, DOE has included a conversion to electronic 8-foot T12 SP slimline systems. DOE now assumes 80 percent of the 8-foot T12 single pin lamps would be replaced by two 4-foot MBP T8 systems, with the remaining 20 percent split evenly between 8-foot T8 and electronic 8-foot T12 SP slimline systems. iv. Four-Foot T5 Lamps scenarios and introducing new standards-case scenarios. These scenarios are discussed in detail below and in TSD chapter 10.</rawString>

<rawString>a. Shift/Roll-Up Scenarios In the March 2008 ANOPR, DOE modeled lower-bound and upper-bound energy conservation scenarios for the GSFL standards-case NIA to characterize the range of energy savings that may result from standards. 73 FR 13620, 13671 (March 13, 2008). In the standards-case NIA for GSFL and commercial IRL, DOE first modeled a lower-bound energy conservation scenario called the Roll-up scenario. 73 FR 13620, 13671 (March 13, 2008). This scenario assumes that consumers owning lamps or systems that do not meet the new standards will ‘‘roll up’’ to the lowest first-cost option available (preserving lumen output if possible) when purchasing standards-compliant lamps. (March 2008 ANOPR TSD chapter 9) The Roll-up scenario also</rawString>
