II-4 To ensure that a vehicle is equipped with an ESC system that meets the proposed definition and to allow the agency to verify that the ESC system meets operational requirements that may not necessarily be validated under the proposed performance tests, the agency is proposing that vehicle manufacturers make the following information available to the agency: (1) A system diagram that identifies all ESC system hardware, (2) A written explanation describing the ESC system’s basic operational characteristics, (3) A discussion of the pertinent inputs to the computer and how its algorithm uses that information to mitigate rollover and limit oversteer and understeer, and (4) For truck tractors, information that shows how the tractor provides brake pressure to a towed trailer.

LAR is the ratio of lateral acceleration corrected for the vehicle’s roll angle at a specific time to the maximum lateral acceleration measured between 4.5 seconds after the beginning of steering and the time when steering is completed. The beginning of steering is the point at which the maneuver begins and the steering wheel angle begins to change II-10 from 0 degree. The completion of steering is the point at which the maneuver ends and the steering wheel angle returns to 0 degree. ESC would be required to meet two LAR performance limits (i.e., the maximum allowable value of the ratio): (1) 0.75 second after completion of the steering input for the 0.5 Hz, 72 km/h Sine with Dwell maneuver, LAR has to be less than or equal to 30 percent.

ESC is required to meet the following two YRR performance limits: (1) 0.75 seconds after completion of the steering input for the 0.5 Hz Sine with Dwell maneuver, the yaw rate of the vehicle has to be less than or equal to 40 percent of the first local peak yaw rate produced by the steering reversal.

Preventing crashes not only saves lives and reduces injuries. ESC also alleviates crash-related travel delays and property damage. Therefore, the estimated benefits include both injury and non-injury components. The “injury benefits” discussed in this chapter are the estimated fatalities and injuries that would be prevented by the proposal. The non-injury benefits include the travel delay and property damage savings from crashes that would be avoided by ESC. Basically, the size of the benefits depends on two elements: (1) the target crash population (P) and (2) the ESC effectiveness (e) against that population. The overall injury reduction benefit of the proposal is equal to the product of these two elements and can be expressed mathematically by the following generic formula: B = P * e Where, B = Benefit of the rule, P = Target crash population, and e = Effectiveness of ESC. The target population includes fatalities, non-fatal injuries measured by the maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS), and property damage only vehicles (PDOVs).

Therefore, the process eliminates the need for acquiring the installation rates in the real-world crash database. The estimated/projected ESC and RSC installation rates for MY 2005 to 2012 truck tractors are presented in Chapter V, Cost and Leadtime. Of these, installation rates for MY 2005 to 2008 and were used for deriving the overall ESC and RSC installation rates in the operational fleet of truck tractors. Installation rates for MY 2004 and older truck tractors are assumed to be zero percent. These two factors are: (1) the ratio of projected rollover and LOC crashes in 2012 that would not involve ESC- and RSC-equipped applicable vehicles to those at the baseline level (f1) and (2) the relative portion of projected target crashes that already had RSC and can be further impacted by ESC (f2) to those projected crashes without either ESC and RSC. Applying the first factor, f1, to the initial target crashes derives the projected target crashes in which the involved applicable vehicles would have neither ESC nor RSC (Base 1).
