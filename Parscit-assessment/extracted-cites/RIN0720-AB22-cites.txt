Since the beginning of the FCP program, outpatient pharmaceuticals provided by DoD through MTF pharmacies have been subject to FCPs, as have those under the TMOP program since it began. Implementation of similar applicability to the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Network component of the Program is the subject of this proposed regulation. B. Provisions of the Rule The proposed rule would add a new paragraph (q) to § 199.21. Paragraph (q)(1) repeats the new statutory requirement. Paragraph (q)(2) provides that an agreement by a manufacturer to honor the FCPs in the Retail Pharmacy Network component of the Pharmacy Benefits Program is a condition of inclusion of a drug on the uniform formulary. Further, it states that a drug not under such an agreement requires preauthorization to be provided through the Retail Pharmacy Network. In addition, it indicates that drugs covered by this requirement are TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Network provided drugs that are covered by the VA’s FCP program, except any prescr</context>

DoD is specifically interested in the legal justification, including under section 703 of NDAA–08, for any alternative implementation approaches and/or dates that commenters may propose. Paragraph (q)(3) establishes refund procedures to, in the words of the statute, ‘‘ensure that pharmaceuticals paid for by the DoD that are provided by pharmacies under the program to eligible covered beneficiaries under this section are subject to the pricing standards’’ of the FCP program. The refund procedures will, to the extent practicable, incorporate common industry practices for implementing pricing agreements between manufacturers and large pharmacy benefit plan sponsors.

Further, this paragraph of the rule provides that a refund due under the statute is subject to the overpayment recovery procedures of § 199.11 of the TRICARE regulation. Finally, paragraph (q)(4) states that in the case of the failure of a manufacturer of a covered drug to make or honor an agreement to ensure that DoD pays no more than the FCP for covered drugs provided through the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Network component of the program, the Director, TMA, in addition VerDate Aug&lt;31&amp;gt;2005 16:33 Jul 24, 2008 Jkt 214001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\25JYP1.SGM 25JYP1jle nti ni on P RO D1 PC 65 w ith P RO PO SA LS 43396 Federal Register / Vol. 73, No. 144 / Friday, July 25, 2008 / Proposed Rules to other actions referred to in the rule, may take any other action autho</context>
