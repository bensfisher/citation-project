Capital Regulation Seeks to Address Market Failures Capital regulation seeks to address market failures that stem from the unique structure and role of banks in the financial system. These market failures tend to create incentives for managers of banking organizations to hold less capital than is optimal from a broader societal perspective. Managers, in responding rationally to those distorted incentives, may try to hold capital that may not adequately account for the institution’s exposure to risk. This in turn can 5 In relevant part, 12 U.S.C. Section 3907 provides: (a)(1) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall cause banking institutions to achieve and maintain adequate capital by establishing minimum levels of capital for such banking institutions and by using such other methods as the appropriate Federal banking agency deems appropriate. (2) Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall have the authority to establish such minimum level of capital for a banking institution as the appropriate Federal banking agency, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the banking institution. (b)(1) Failure</context>

The 1988 Accord consists of three basic elements: a target minimum capital ratio of 8 percent; a definition of the capital instruments to comprise the numerator of the capital-to-risk-weighted-assets ratio; and a system of risk weights for calculating the denominator of the ratio. As implemented in the United States, the risk-weighting criteria of the 1988 Accord divide credit exposures into four basic categories and assign a fixed risk weight to each category. The four categories and their respective risk weights are (1) cash and sovereign exposures with a risk weight of 0 percent, (2) interbank and certain other relatively low-risk exposures with a risk weight of 20 percent, (3) residential mortgages with a risk weight of 50 percent, and (4) all other exposures (including unsecured corporate exposures), which carry a 100 percent risk weight. A risk weight of 100 percent means that the calculation of risk-weighted assets includes the exposure at its full value, which translates to a capital requirement equal to 8 percent of the amount of the exposure. Off-balance-sheet exposures convert into “credit-equivalen</context>
