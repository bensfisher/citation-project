The state and local employer cost-per-hour for employee compensation (including benefits) is $37.73 in December 2007 dollars (U.S. DOL, 2007). Table 9-1 details the calculation of the government administrative costs. Total costs are provided for both the federal and state and local governments. 65 Processing and reviewing DMR’s is only required under Option 2 and Option 3. Option 1 does not have any turbidity monitoring requirements. 66 Alaska, District of Columbia, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico do not have approved NPDES programs. Therefore, the administrative cost for their project DMR’s is attributed to the federal government. 67 The 1.6 overhead and fringe benefits multiplier is assumed according to the EPA ICR Handbook.</rawString>

This assumption implies that the demand for new housing is highly inelastic (all costs pass through as a price increase with no change in the equilibrium quantity of new housing sold or rented).

Sediments and other pollutants from construction sites may have a wide range of effects on water resources located in the vicinity of construction sites. These environmental changes affect economic productivity (e.g., navigation, water storage, and water treatment) as well as environmental services valued by humans (e.g., recreation, public and private property ownership, existence services such as aquatic life, wildlife, and habitat designated uses). Related market benefits (e.g., avoided costs of producing various market goods and services) and non-market benefits are additive (Freeman 2003). In all cases, benefits are conceptualized and estimated based on established welfare theoretic models (Freeman 2003; Just et al. 2004). EPA considered four categories of quantifiable monetary benefits from the C&amp;D Regulation:  Benefits to Navigation (Section 6.1) – Navigable waterways are often dredged to maintain their navigable depth and width.

The environmental changes affecting environmental services valued by humans are monetized in the preceding sections. Non-market benefits or existence services such as aquatic life, wildlife, and habitat designated use (Freeman 2003) need to be considered in addition to market benefits (e.g., avoided costs of producing various market goods and services). To link water quality changes from reduced sediment runoff to effects on human uses and support for aquatic and terrestrial species habitat, this analysis utilizes a water quality index (WQI) based on the one developed by McClelland (1974), which EPA has modified to rely on fewer parameters (U.S. EPA 2002, EPA 2004a).

There are three key empirical difficulties identified in the housing supply elasticity literature. First, estimated housing supply elasticities vary widely. Second, price does not seem to be a sufficient statistic, and other market indicators are quite important in explaining supply (e.g., land availability, land-use and other regulatory restrictions, and demographic characteristics). Third, construction levels seem to respond quite sluggishly to construction costs and output prices (DiPasquale, 1999; Hwang and Quigley, 2006; Green, Malpezzi and Mayo, 2005). EPA’s review of the literature indicates that the supply of residential and non-residential construction space is generally elastic, although there can be significant variability across specific markets or regions. For example, an MSA-level analysis of residential supply elasticity found statistically significant elasticity values ranging from 1.43 – 21.6 (Green, Malpezzi and Mayo, 2005). Green, Malpezzi and Mayo (2005) estimate separate supply elasticities for individual U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) using annual data for 45 MSAs and over 18 yea</context>

Although the industry has been on a fairly continuous growth trend since 1964, there have been a few interruptions within this upward movement.

The environmental changes affecting environmental services valued by humans are monetized in the preceding sections. Non-market benefits or existence services such as aquatic life, wildlife, and habitat designated use (Freeman 2003) need to be considered in addition to market benefits (e.g., avoided costs of producing various market goods and services). To link water quality changes from reduced sediment runoff to effects on human uses and support for aquatic and terrestrial species habitat, this analysis utilizes a water quality index (WQI) based on the one developed by McClelland (1974), which EPA has modified to rely on fewer parameters (U.S. EPA 2002, EPA 2004a). This index is linked to specific pollutant levels, which in turn are linked to the presence of aquatic species and suitability for particular recreational uses. The WQI allows the use of objective water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen concentrations) to characterize ecosystem services or uses provided by a given water body. The WQI is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is poor quality and 100 is excellent. The complete description and associated equations and tables can be found in Chapter 10 of</context>

To account for the effect of inflation in this analysis, the estimated cost of capital is reduced by the assumed constant rate at which cash flow is assumed to grow. This approach is equivalent mathematically to using a real discount rate (i.e., setting aside the component of cost of capital which results from inflation) in the discounted cash flow calculation. For this adjustment, EPA used a nominal cash flow growth rate of 3.1 percent, which is the average of year-to-year rates of change of the Engineering News-Record’s Construction Cost Index over the period 1990-2007 (McGraw Hill, 2008).

This assumption implies that the demand for new housing is highly inelastic (all costs pass through as a price increase with no change in the equilibrium quantity of new housing sold or rented).

The complete description and associated equations and tables can be found in Chapter 10 of the Environmental Assessment Document. This section describes the use of meta-analysis of surface water valuation studies for estimating benefits of water quality improvements resulting from the C&amp;D regulation. The technical details involved in the estimation of original meta-analyses are presented in Chapter 10 and Appendix A of the Environmental Assessment Document as well as in sources such as Johnston et al. (2005; 2006), Bateman and Jones (2003), Shrestha et al. (2007), Rosenberger and Phipps (2007), and U.S. EPA (2004c). 6.4.1 Estimated Changes in Water Quality (∆WQI) from the C&amp;D Regulation To estimate benefits of water quality improvements expected from the C&amp;D regulation, EPA estimated WQI for each regulatory option. In calculating the post-compliance WQI, the Agency used option-specific TSS concentrations from the SPARROW output. The sediment loading estimates for each regulatory option reflect the expected reduction in sediment runoff under the regulatory options. The other contributing parameters to the WQI were held constant for all regulatory options. Each RF1 reach that has an </context>

The general approach follows standard methods illustrated by Johnston et al. (2005) and Shrestha et al. (2007), among many others (see Rosenberger and Phipps 2007). This function allows the Agency to forecast WTP based on assigned values for model variables, chosen to represent a resource change in the C&amp;D policy context. Table 6-13 presents mean values and confidence interval boundaries of household WTP for water quality improvements resulting form reduced sediment discharges from construction sties by EPA region and regulatory option.

Because benefits analysis of environmental regulations rarely affords enough time to develop original stated preference surveys that are specific to the policy effects, benefit transfer is often the only option to inform a policy decision. As a result, they are nearly universal in benefit-cost analyses (Smith et al. 2002).  Benefit transfers are by definition characterized by a difference between the context in which resource values are estimated and that in which benefit estimates are desired (Rosenberger and Phipps 2007). The ability of meta-analysis to adjust for the influence of study, economic, and resource characteristics on WTP can minimize, but not eliminate, potential biases (Rosenberger and Stanley 2006; Rosenberger and Phipps 2007; Smith et al. 2002). As is typical in applied benefit transfers, the meta-analysis model used in this analysis provides a close, but not perfect, match to the context in which values are desired.

Some resource valuation studies have found that respondents in the typical contingent market situation may overstate their WTP compared to their likely behavior in a real-world situation. However, the magnitude of hypothetical bias on the estimated WTP is uncertain. Following standard benefit transfer approaches, including meta-analytic transfers, this analysis proceeds under the assumption that each source study provides a valid, unbiased estimate of the welfare measure under consideration (cf. Moeltner et al. 2006; Rosenberger and Phipps 2007). To minimize potential hypothetical bias EPA set independent variable values to reflect best benefit transfer practices.  The estimation of WTP may be sensitive to differences in the environmental water quality measures. Studies that did not use the WQI were mapped to the WQI so a comparison could be made across studies. The dummy variable (WQI) captures the effect of a study using (WQI=1) or not using the WQI (WQI=0). It was found that studies that did not use the WQI had lower WTP values. This may indicate that there may have been some systematic biases in the mapping of studies that did n</context>

Furthermore, approximately 10 percent of the nation’s nearly 7 million total business establishments are in the C&amp;D industry, demonstrating the dominance of small firms in this industry. The number of paid employees in the C&amp;D industry accounts for 6.6 percent of total U.S. employment (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005a). Establishments in this industry are involved in a wide variety of activities, including land development and subdivision, homebuilding, remodeling, construction of nonresidential buildings and other structures, and heavy construction work (including roadways and bridges). Establishments are also involved in a myriad of special trades, such as plumbing, roofing, electrical, excavation, and demolition work. Some of these activities result in land disturbance, which can cause erosion and transport soil and sediment in stormwater runoff. The regulatory options presented in this economic analys</context>

Therefore, one firm could comprise several establishments. 2.1.2 Organization of this Chapter The purpose of this profile is to provide an overview of the C&amp;D industry, describe its key characteristics and structure, and analyze current and historical trends.

These establishment counts, however, do not match those reported in the Economic Census. This inconsistency is partially due to differences in coverage (the SBA data include administrative establishments while the Economic Census does not) as well as differences in data collection methods. 12 For clarification, an establishment is defined as “a relatively permanent office or other place of business where the usual business activities related to construction are conducted” (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005). A firm refers to the aggregation of all establishments owned by one company; one firm, therefore, could consist of several establishments. 13 &quot;The data excludes non-employer businesses, thus excluding many self-employed individuals (employment is measured in March, so firms starting after March, firms closing before March, and seasonal firms can have zero employment).&quot; (U.S. SBA, 2004) Economic Analysis of Construction &amp; Development Effluent Limitation Guidelines Chapter 2: Economic Profile November 14, 2008 Internal Draft – Deliberative, Predecisional – Do not Quote, Cite, or Distribute 2-3</context>

The practical impact of the regulation on low/moderate-income (and first-time home buyers, to the extent these home buyers are more likely to have low/moderate incomes) is also probably overstated in the analysis because these households are less likely to purchase newly constructed housing than higher income home buyers.

This assumption implies that the demand for new housing is highly inelastic (all costs pass through as a price increase with no change in the equilibrium quantity of new housing sold or rented). Such conditions would generally be expected to prevail during relative “boom” periods in the market for housing (e.g., most recently in 2005 - 2006)</context>

The complete description and associated equations and tables can be found in Chapter 10 of the Environmental Assessment Document. This section describes the use of meta-analysis of surface water valuation studies for estimating benefits of water quality improvements resulting from the C&amp;D regulation. The technical details involved in the estimation of original meta-analyses are presented in Chapter 10 and Appendix A of the Environmental Assessment Document as well as in sources such as Johnston et al. (2005; 2006), Bateman and Jones (2003), Shrestha et al.

In calculating the post-compliance WQI, the Agency used option-specific TSS concentrations from the SPARROW output.

The population considered in the benefits analysis of the C&amp;D regulation does not represent all the households that are likely to hold values for water resources in a given state. Residents of other states may hold values for water resources outside of their home state, in particular if such resources have regional or national significance.  The Agency notes, as detailed by Loomis (1996; Loomis et al. 2000) and Bateman et al. (2006), among others, that there are numerous uncertainties and associated assumptions required to aggregate WTP across spatial jurisdictions. While these uncertainties are well known, the literature does not agree on appropriate, standardized guidance for benefit aggregations, and applied benefit-cost analysis almost universally requires simplifying assumptions in order to generate defensible welfare aggregations.

More details of the conceptual framework underlying this benefits assessment and a discussion of additional benefits categories not monetized can be found in Chapter 4 of the Environmental Assessment Document. EPA used the SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) model (USGS 2008) to predict changes in sediment loadings and concentrations resulting from expected reductions in construction site sediment discharges brought about by this regulation.

Although the industry has been on a fairly continuous growth trend since 1964, there have been a few interruptions within this upward movement. Within the industry, residential construction, as compared to nonresidential and other public construction, has experienced the most volatility of business performance. From 1991 to 2005, the industry grew fairly continuously. Single-family h</context>

Adverse Business Conditions Case: based on a higher equity market premium to reflect the higher degree of investor risk aversion during periods of weak economic performance. See Section 4.3.2.2 of the EA for more detail.  Also, cost of equity differs by size of firm.
