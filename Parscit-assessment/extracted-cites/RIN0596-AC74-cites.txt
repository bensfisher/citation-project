Results apply to the five counties (Delta, Garfield, Mesa, Montrose, and Rio Blanco) included in the “Energy area” IMPLAN model developed for this analysis. Local Governments Mineral Lease Payments Sizeable revenues accrue to State and local governments from the production of energy resources on Federal lands. These revenues are important contributions to the fiscal health of small and large governmental entities alike. Royalties of 12.5 percent are paid on production value from Federal mineral leases. Half of these revenues are paid to the states where production originated. In Colorado, these revenues are allocated to a variety of State funds, including the State Public School Fund, and to local jurisdictions where employees of mining companies reside.</rawString>

Because the proposed rule does not prescribe site-specific activities, it is difficult to predict changes in benefits under the different alternatives. It should also be emphasized that the types of benefits derived from uses of roadless areas in Colorado are far ranging and include a number of non-market and non-use benefit categories. As a consequence, benefits are discussed qualitatively in many sections of this report. Details about the environmental effects of the proposed rule can be found in the revised draft environmental impact statement (RDEIS) for the proposed rule (USDA Forest Service, 2010), as well as ‘specialist’ reports developed to support the effects summarized in the RDEIS.

The analysis of potential effects relies on resource information readily available from geographic information system (GIS) map coverage, resource inventory databases, and resource specialist reports (see chapter 3 of the RDEIS (USDA Forest Service, 2010)). The two primary activities that differ between the alternatives are (1) roading, and (2) treecutting and removal. These two activities have the greatest likelihood of altering and fragmenting landscapes with a result of immediate, long-term loss of roadless area values and characteristics.

<context position="174237" citStr="Service 2010" startWordPosition="25532" endWordPosition="25533"> service areas are assessed in detail in chapter 3 of the RDEIS, but the differences in impacts to or from many of these resources or services are found to be minimal or insignificant across alternatives and therefore not discussed in detail in this report. These areas include livestock grazing, saleable minerals, other leasable minerals), locatable minerals6, recreational special uses (including outfitters and guides), and non-timber products. Distributional Effects The details about economic impact analysis for this report are provided in the revised Economics Specialist Report (USDA Forest Service 2010b). Distributional effects are discussed in the context of (1) changes in jobs and income for sectors where measurable output differs significantly across alternatives, (2) changes in revenue sharing (payments to states and counties) associated with receipts from sectors where output differs significantly, and (3) changes in opportunities for protecting values at risk in communities and counties adjacent to roadless areas. Economic impact analysis is used to evaluate potential direct, indirect, and induced effects on the economy. Economic impacts are estimated using input-output analysis. Inpu</context>
