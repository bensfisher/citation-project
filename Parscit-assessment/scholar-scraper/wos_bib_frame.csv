   packet warnings. Previous warnings were text only. New warnings include
   one of 14 pictures, many depicting tobacco-related pathology. Methods:
   This study monitored the roll-out of the health policy initiative using
   multiple methodologies. Print media coverage of new pack warnings was
   observed over 3 years. Story content was coded as positive (supportive
   of pack warnings), neutral or negative. An observational study of small
   random sample of metropolitan stores (n = 16) over 7 months measured the
   pace of the roll-out in shops. Once new packs were readily available in
   stores, smokers (n = 152) were intercepted in city streets and asked
   about their reactions. Results: Of the 67 media stories, 85\% were
   positive or neutral about the new warnings and 15\% were negative.
   Supportive content presented health benefits. Unsupportive content
   presented industry arguments. After the legislative change, it took 2
   months before any new packs appeared in stores. After 6 months, the
   majority carried them. Newest images had highest recall among smokers.
   About 60\% said new warnings detracted from the look of their brand.
   About 51\% felt the increased risk of dying from smoking-related
   illness. About 38\% felt motivated to quit. Conclusion: Plans by
   government to introduce graphic warnings were delayed up to 2 years,
   apparently by heavy industry lobbying. Actual widespread appearance in
   shops occurred several months after the implementation date. While media
   coverage of the new warnings reported the industry arguments against

   comparing the short-term impact of new graphic (2006) Australian
   warnings with: (i) earlier (2003) United Kingdom larger text-based
   warnings; (ii) and Canadian graphic warnings (late 2000); and also to
   extend our understanding of warning wear-out.
   Methods: The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC
   Project) follows prospective cohorts (with replenishment) of adult
   smokers annually (five waves: 2002-2006), in Canada, United States, UK
   and Australia (around 2000 per country per wave; total n = 17 773).
   Measures were of pack warning salience (reading and noticing); cognitive
   responses (thoughts of harm and quitting); and two behavioural
   responses: forgoing cigarettes and avoiding the warnings.
   Results: All four indicators of impact increased markedly among
   Australian smokers following the introduction of graphic warnings.
   Controlling for date of introduction, they stimulated more cognitive
   responses than the UK (text-only) changes, and were avoided more, did
   not significantly increase forgoing cigarettes, but were read and
   noticed less. The findings also extend previous work showing partial
   wear-out of both graphic and text-only warnings, but the Canadian
   warnings have more sustained effects than UK ones.
   Conclusions: Australia's new health warnings increased reactions that
   are prospectively predictive of cessation activity. Warning size
   increases warning effectiveness and graphic warnings may be superior to
   text-based warnings. While there is partial wear-out in the initial
   impact associated with all warnings, stronger warnings tend to sustain
   their effects for longer. These findings support arguments for
   governments to exceed minimum FCTC requirements on warnings.}","{10.1136/tc.2008.028043}","{0964-4563}","{ISI:000270142700009}",NA,"{Fong, Geoffrey/H-2810-2014}","{Fong, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9098-6472}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   use (HAU) exacerbates the rate of fibrosis progression in the liver and
   results in increased probability for premature death among patients with
   hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The current study uses
   population-based mortality data to investigate whether heavy drinking
   affects the age of death among individuals with HCV and, if so, whether
   this effect differs between men and women.
   Methods: A total of 7,263,163 death records in the United States between
   2000 and 2002 were drawn from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD)
   public-use data files compiled by the National Center for Health
   Statistics (NCHS). International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
   Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to identify the presence of HCV (B17.1
   and B18.2) and HAU (as indicated by alcohol-induced medical conditions,
   F10 and K70) either as the underlying cause or as one of the
   contributing causes of death. The deaths were divided into 4 distinctive
   cause-of-death categories: HCV without HAU, HAU without HCV, HCV plus
   HAU, and all others. The mean ages of death and the cumulative
   probabilities of death derived from multiple-cause life table were
   compared across these categories.
   Results: Hepatitis C virus deaths showed an excessive prevalence of HAU
   when compared with non-HCV deaths. Compared with deaths of HCV without
   HAU, the mean age of death was shortened for deaths of HCV plus HAU
   (from 55.1 to 50.0 years among males, and from 61.0 to 49.1 years among
   females). The cumulative probability of death before age 65 was much
   higher for the latter than the former group (0.91 vs 0.68 among males,
   and 0.88 vs 0.47 among females). While HCV alone showed a
   disproportionate effect on premature death in males, HAU presented a
   stronger effect in females, resulting in a ``catching-up{''} effect that
   diminished the gender difference in age of HCV death.
   Conclusions: This study provides mortality-based evidence to further
   establish heavy alcohol consumption as one of the key risk factors
   contributing to premature deaths from HCV in the United States. More
   importantly, this study, for the first time, presents empirical evidence
   that alcohol consumption affects men and women differently in HCV
   mortality.}","{10.1111/j.1530-0277.2006.00304.x}","{0145-6008}","{ISI:000243674200014}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort
   study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and
   mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990.
   We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air
   pollution concentrations.
   Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between
   1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available
   data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the
   two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change
   between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire
   follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were
   estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for

   Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality
   associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as
   the overall mean (rate ratio {[}RR], 1.16; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95\%

   Methods: Participants between 20 and 24 years of age were part of a
   10-year cohort study begun when the group was in Grade 6, with the
   purpose of examining factors that may affect smoking. Five questions
   about warning labels were added to the 2002 questionnaire requesting
   information on perceptions of the labels and their potential impact on

   previous questionnaires.
   Results: 32.8\% (n=1267) of the respondents were smokers, with males

   Conclusion: Despite the efforts taken in developing the labels, some
   young adults are skeptical about their effects. Warning labels may have

   rest of the country. In the more realistic scenario of doubling the
   downward trend in tobacco consumption, the Southeast Tobacco region
   would lose 6300 jobs in 1993 (0.03\% of regional employment) and 36 600
   jobs by 2000 (0.2\%). The 8 nontobacco regions would gain 6400 jobs in
   1993 and 56 300 jobs in 2000, with each of the nontobacco regions
   gaining employment in every year.
   Conclusions.-Contrary to the tobacco industry's claims, reductions in
   spending on tobacco products will boost employment in every one of the 8
   nontobacco regions and will not diminish employment in the Southeast
   Tobacco region by as much as the industry estimates. The primary concern
   about tobacco should be the enormity of its toll on health and not its
   impact on employment.}","{10.1001/jama.275.16.1241}","{0098-7484}","{ISI:A1996UF47800027}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   cast as targeted changes in age-adjusted cause-specific death rates.
   This research centred on the projected impact of such changes on life
   expectancy and the mortality toll for each sex.
   Methods. A computer simulation was conducted using single decrement,
   multiple decrement and cause-elimination life table techniques, together
   with a decomposition procedure.
   Results. Male and female life expectancy at birth was projected to
   increase by 1.71 and 1.51 years, respectively, between the designated
   1987 baseline and 2000. The leading beneficiaries would be those aged 65
   and older, followed by those aged 45-64, and infants. Declines in
   coronary heart disease, stroke and injury death rates would most
   influence the projected life expectancy changes, irrespective of sex.
   Approximately 782 000 male deaths and 730 000 female deaths would be
   averted under Year 2000 assumptions.
   Conclusions. Life expectancy would be a useful summary measure to
   incorporate into official evaluations of the Year 2000 mortality
   objectives. Targeting of excess male mortality in the US and other
   highly industrialized nations is recommended.}","{10.1093/ije/24.3.547}","{0300-5771}","{ISI:A1995RF21200011}",NA,"{Rockett, Ian/A-4709-2008}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
