   involves documenting ozone-induced visible injury to known
   ozone-sensitive species under conditions of ambient exposure. The USDA
   Forest Service administers a long-term, nationwide ozone biomonitoring
   program to address public and scientific concerns about ozone impacts on
   forest health. A systematic grid is used as the basis for biomonitoring
   site locations. At each site, trained field crews evaluate a maximum of
   thirty plants of up to six species and record the amount and severity of
   leaf-injury on individual plants. Injury from ozone was found more often
   on biomonitoring sites in the eastern Unites States than in the interior
   or west-coast areas. Further results from the northeast reveal that in
   any year, there is a higher percentage of ozone-injured plants with more
   severe symptoms in areas with relatively high ozone concentrations than
   in areas with relatively low ozone. In very dry years ( e. g., 1999) the
   percentage of injured plants and injury severity estimates are both
   sharply reduced even though ambient ozone exposures are high. These
   findings demonstrate that biomonitoring data provide meaningful evidence
   of when high ozone concentrations during the growing season have
   biological significance. Any assessment of ozone stress in the forest
   environment must include both biomonitoring (i. e., plant response) and
   air quality data to be complete.}","{10.1023/A:1024879527764}","{0167-6369}","{ISI:000184256300004}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   comparing the short-term impact of new graphic (2006) Australian
   warnings with: (i) earlier (2003) United Kingdom larger text-based
   warnings; (ii) and Canadian graphic warnings (late 2000); and also to
   extend our understanding of warning wear-out.
   Methods: The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC
   Project) follows prospective cohorts (with replenishment) of adult
   smokers annually (five waves: 2002-2006), in Canada, United States, UK
   and Australia (around 2000 per country per wave; total n = 17 773).
   Measures were of pack warning salience (reading and noticing); cognitive
   responses (thoughts of harm and quitting); and two behavioural
   responses: forgoing cigarettes and avoiding the warnings.
   Results: All four indicators of impact increased markedly among
   Australian smokers following the introduction of graphic warnings.
   Controlling for date of introduction, they stimulated more cognitive
   responses than the UK (text-only) changes, and were avoided more, did
   not significantly increase forgoing cigarettes, but were read and
   noticed less. The findings also extend previous work showing partial
   wear-out of both graphic and text-only warnings, but the Canadian
   warnings have more sustained effects than UK ones.
   Conclusions: Australia's new health warnings increased reactions that
   are prospectively predictive of cessation activity. Warning size
   increases warning effectiveness and graphic warnings may be superior to
   text-based warnings. While there is partial wear-out in the initial
   impact associated with all warnings, stronger warnings tend to sustain
   their effects for longer. These findings support arguments for
   governments to exceed minimum FCTC requirements on warnings.}","{10.1136/tc.2008.028043}","{0964-4563}","{ISI:000270142700009}","{Fong, Geoffrey/H-2810-2014}","{Fong, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9098-6472}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   packet warnings. Previous warnings were text only. New warnings include
   one of 14 pictures, many depicting tobacco-related pathology. Methods:
   This study monitored the roll-out of the health policy initiative using
   multiple methodologies. Print media coverage of new pack warnings was
   observed over 3 years. Story content was coded as positive (supportive
   of pack warnings), neutral or negative. An observational study of small
   random sample of metropolitan stores (n = 16) over 7 months measured the
   pace of the roll-out in shops. Once new packs were readily available in
   stores, smokers (n = 152) were intercepted in city streets and asked
   about their reactions. Results: Of the 67 media stories, 85\% were
   positive or neutral about the new warnings and 15\% were negative.
   Supportive content presented health benefits. Unsupportive content
   presented industry arguments. After the legislative change, it took 2
   months before any new packs appeared in stores. After 6 months, the
   majority carried them. Newest images had highest recall among smokers.
   About 60\% said new warnings detracted from the look of their brand.
   About 51\% felt the increased risk of dying from smoking-related
   illness. About 38\% felt motivated to quit. Conclusion: Plans by
   government to introduce graphic warnings were delayed up to 2 years,
   apparently by heavy industry lobbying. Actual widespread appearance in
   shops occurred several months after the implementation date. While media
   coverage of the new warnings reported the industry arguments against

   levels have been described in depth, and many recent epidemiologic
   studies have also consistently reported positive associations between
   exposure to air pollutants at low concentrations (particularly PM2.5)
   and adverse health outcomes.
   Objective: To estimate the number of avoidable deaths associated with
   reducing PM2.5 levels in Spain.
   Materials and methods: For exposure assessment, we used the US
   Environmental Protection Agency's Community Multiscale Air Quality model
   to simulate air pollution levels with a spatial resolution of 18 x 18
   km(2). Two different scenarios were compared, namely, a baseline 2004
   scenario based on Spain's National Emissions Inventory and a projected
   2011 scenario in which a reduction in PM2.5 was estimated on the basis
   of the benefits that might be attained if specific air quality policies
   were implemented. Using an 18 x 18 km2 grid, air pollution data were
   estimated for the entire Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, Ceuta
   and Melilla. For these strata, crude all-cause mortality rates (ICD-10:
   A00-Y98) were then calculated for the over-30 and 25-74 age groups,
   taking into account the 2004 population figures corresponding to these
   same age groups, selected in accordance with the concentration-response
   functions (Pope CA 3rd, Burnett RT,Thun MJ, Calle EE, Krewski D, Ito K
   et al. Lung cancer, cardiopulmonary mortality, and long-term exposure to
   fine particulate air pollution. JAMA 2002; 287:1132-41; Laden F.

   pollution and mortality: extended follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities
   study. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006; 173:667-72.). Health impacts were
   assessed using the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program
   (BenMAP).
   Results: Air quality improvement was defined as an average annual
   reduction of 0.7 mu g/m(3) in PM2.5 levels. Using long-term health
   impact assessment analysis, we estimated that 1720 (673-2760) all-cause
   deaths (6 per 100,000 population) in the over-30 age group and
   1450(780-2108) all-cause deaths (5 per 100,000 population) in the 25-74
   age group could be prevented annually.
   Conclusions: The results showed the potential benefits in general
   mortality which could be expected if pollution control policies were
   successfully implemented by 2011. A specifically adapted BenMAP could be
   used as a tool for estimating health impacts associated with changes in
   air pollution in Spain. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}","{10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.004}","{0160-4120}","{ISI:000287620100006}","{Moreno, Teresa/C-9349-2009

   than one quarter of the package to text and graphics covering over half
   the package. This study examines how Canadians in their 20s feel about
   the current graphic warning labels and their potential to prevent
   smoking and encourage quitting.
   Methods: Participants between 20 and 24 years of age were part of a
   10-year cohort study begun when the group was in Grade 6, with the
   purpose of examining factors that may affect smoking. Five questions
   about warning labels were added to the 2002 questionnaire requesting
   information on perceptions of the labels and their potential impact on

   Results: 32.8\% (n=1267) of the respondents were smokers, with males

   Conclusion: Despite the efforts taken in developing the labels, some
   young adults are skeptical about their effects. Warning labels may have

   Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort
   study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and
   mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990.
   We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air
   pollution concentrations.
   Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between
   1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available
   data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the
   two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change

   significantly reduce employment in the United States, as the tobacco
   industry claims.
   Design.-Computer simulation of the economies of the Southeast Tobacco
   region and 8 nontobacco regions of the United States, with domestic
   tobacco expenditures eliminated or reduced and the equivalent spending
   redistributed, according to consumers' normal spending patterns, We
   compared these results with baseline forecasts of the regional economies
   that include normal tobacco expenditures.
   Main Outcome Measure.-Number of jobs.
   Results.-Had there been no spending on tobacco products in the United
   States in 1993, the Southeast Tobacco region would have had 303 000
   fewer jobs. Collectively, however, the 8 nontobacco regions would have
   gained enough employment to completely offset losses in the Southeast
   Tobacco region, with every nontobacco region gaining jobs. By the year
   2000, the absence of tobacco spending would mean a loss of 222 000 jobs
   in the Southeast Tobacco region, but a gain of 355 000 throughout the
   rest of the country. In the more realistic scenario of doubling the
   downward trend in tobacco consumption, the Southeast Tobacco region

   1993 and 56 300 jobs in 2000, with each of the nontobacco regions
   gaining employment in every year.
   Conclusions.-Contrary to the tobacco industry's claims, reductions in
   spending on tobacco products will boost employment in every one of the 8
   nontobacco regions and will not diminish employment in the Southeast
   Tobacco region by as much as the industry estimates. The primary concern

   of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive.
   Objective To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine
   particulate air pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and
   cardiopulmonary mortality.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Vital status and cause of death data
   were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer
   Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective mortality study, which
   enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants
   completed a questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age,
   sex, race, weight, height, smoking history, education, marital status,
   diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor
   data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data
   for metropolitan areas throughout the United States and combined with
   vital status and cause of death data through December 31, 1998.
   Main Outcome Measure All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary
   mortality.
   Results Fine particulate and sulfur oxide-related pollution were
   associated with all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.
   Each 10-mug/m(3) elevation in fine particulate air pollution was
   associated with approximately a 4\%, 6\%, and 8\% increased risk of
   all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively,
   Measures of coarse particle fraction and total suspended particles were
   not consistently associated with mortality.
   Conclusion Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air
   pollution is an important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary
   and lung cancer mortality.}","{10.1001/jama.287.9.1132}","{0098-7484}","{ISI:000174186000028}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   needed for health policy and priority setting. Our aim was to estimate
   the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle,
   and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent
   and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein
   (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight-obesity; high dietary
   trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids,
   omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical
   inactivity; alcohol use; and tobacco smoking.
   Methods and Findings: We used data on risk factor exposures in the US
   population from nationally representative health surveys and
   disease-specific mortality statistics from the National Center for
   Health Statistics. We obtained the etiological effects of risk factors
   on disease-specific mortality, by age, from systematic reviews and
   meta-analyses of epidemiological studies that had adjusted (i) for major
   potential confounders, and (ii) where possible for regression dilution
   bias. We estimated the number of disease-specific deaths attributable to
   all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure, by age and sex. In
   2005, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an
   estimated 467,000 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 436,000-500,000) and
   395,000 (372,000-414,000) deaths, accounting for about one in five or
   six deaths in US adults. Overweight-obesity (216,000; 188,000-237,000)
   and physical inactivity (191,000; 164,000-222,000) were each responsible
   for nearly 1 in 10 deaths. High dietary salt (102,000; 97,000-107,000),
   low dietary omega-3 fatty acids (84,000; 72,000-96,000), and high
   dietary trans fatty acids (82,000; 63,000-97,000) were the dietary risks
   with the largest mortality effects. Although 26,000 (23,000-40,000)
   deaths from ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes were
   averted by current alcohol use, they were outweighed by 90,000
   (88,000-94,000) deaths from other cardiovascular diseases, cancers,
   liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, alcohol use disorders, road traffic and
   other injuries, and violence.
   Conclusions: Smoking and high blood pressure, which both have effective
   interventions, are responsible for the largest number of deaths in the
   US. Other dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors for chronic
   diseases also cause a substantial number of deaths in the US.}","{10.1371/journal.pmed.1000058}","{1549-1277}","{ISI:000266214800010}",NA,"{Ding, Eric/0000-0002-5881-8097}","{e1000058}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   for approximately 95 years. Since 1989, the community has been
   monitoring blood lead levels in children, studying exposure pathways and
   conducting comprehensive education and case management programs. From
   1989 through 1996, mean blood lead levels of preschool children declined
   at an average rate of 0.6 mug/dl per year. From 1996 to 1999, mean blood
   lead levels fell at an average rate of 1.8 mug/dl per year, from 11.5 in
   1996 to 5.9 in 1999. The recent rapid decline appears to be mainly
   attributable to the start-up of a new lead smelter using modern
   flash-smelting technology in May of 1997. In 1998, the annual arithmetic
   mean air lead level in Trail was 0.28 mug/m(3), compared with 1.1
   mug/m(3) in 1996. Reductions of approximately 50\% were observed in lead
   loadings and concentrations in outdoor dustfall, street dust and indoor
   dustfall after smelter emissions were reduced. Slight reductions
   (statistically insignificant) have been observed in carpet dust and soil
   lead concentrations. During the summer of 2001, the smelting and
   refining operations at Trail were shut down completely for 3 months.
   During this period, average air lead levels in Trail dropped to 0.03

   decreased in Austria in the 1980's - as documented by data on SO2, and
   total suspended particles (TSP) - no such associations between
   day-to-day changes of SO2 and TSP and mortality have been documented any
   more, however, traffic related pollutants like fine particles and NO2
   remained a problem. Therefore, short term effects of PM on lung
   function, morbidity and mortality were investigated in Vienna, Linz,
   Graz and a rural control area. Long-term exposure and chronic disease -
   even more important for public health - were studied in repeated
   cross-sectional, a mixed longitudinal and a birth cohort study on school
   children in the city of Linz. Lung function growth was found impaired
   from long-term exposure to air pollutants and improved in districts
   where ambient air pollution had decreased. Where only TSP and SO2 had
   decreased, no continuous improvement of small airway function was found
   and end-expiratory flow rates stayed impaired where NO2-reduction from
   technical improvements of cars and industry was counterbalanced by
   increase of motorized (diesel) traffic. Remaining acute effects of
   ambient air pollution in 2001 from PM, NO2 and co-pollutants found in a

   Active surface of particles inhaled several hours to days before
   spirometry was found related to short-term reductions in forced vital

   dyspnea, cough when going to sleep, cough at night (p < 0.05). Efforts

   infarction and cancer. In a prospective cohort study on 1630
   dust-exposed and 1630 non dust-exposed workers matched for smoking we
   found an increase of lung cancer related to nonfibrous insoluble PM.
   Other studies were able to relate lung cancer to specific particles like

   of short-lived air pollutants and their precursors (95\% and 85\% of
   mortalities from PM2.5 and O-3 respectively). However, changing climate
   and increasing CH4 concentrations also contribute to premature mortality
   associated with air pollution globally (by up to 5\% and 15 \%,
   respectively). In some regions, the contribution of climate change and
   increased CH4 together are responsible for more than 20\% of the

   Objectives: This study examined the association between mean long-term
   ambient PM2.5 concentrations and lung cancer mortality among 188,699
   lifelong never-smokers drawn from the nearly 1.2 million Cancer
   Prevention Study-II participants enrolled by the American Cancer Society

   proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate
   multivariate adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for
   lung cancer mortality in relation to PM2.5.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 1,100 lung cancer deaths were
   observed during the 26-year follow-up period. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase

   air pollution and most of the primary particulate organic matter. Human
   exposure to combustion emissions including the associated airborne fine
   particles and mutagenic and carcinogenic constituents (e.g., polycyclic
   aromatic compounds (PAC), nitro-PAC) have been studied in populations in
   Europe, America, Asia, and increasingly in third-world counties.
   Bioassay-directed fractionation studies of particulate organic air
   pollution have identified mutagenic and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH), nitrated PAH, nitro-lactones, and lower molecular
   weight compounds from cooking. A number of these components are
   significant sources of human exposure to mutagenic and carcinogenic
   chemicals that may also cause oxidative and DNA damage that can lead to
   reproductive and cardiovascular effects. Chemical and physical tracers
   have been used to apportion outdoor and indoor and personal exposures to
   airborne particles between various combustion emissions and other
   sources. These sources include vehicles (e.g., diesel and gasoline
   vehicles), heating and power sources (e.g., including coal, oil, and
   biomass), indoor sources (e.g., cooking, heating, and tobacco smoke), as
   well as secondary organic aerosols and pollutants derived from
   long-range transport.
   Biomarkers of exposure, dose and susceptibility have been measured in
   populations exposed to air pollution combustion emissions. Biomarkers
   have included metabolic genotype, DNA adducts, PAH metabolites, and
   urinary mutagenic activity. A number of studies have shown a significant
   correlation of exposure to PM2.5 with these biomarkers. In addition,
   stratification by genotype increased this correlation. New multivariate
   receptor models, recently used to determine the sources of ambient
   particles, are now being explored in the analysis of human exposure and
   biomarker data.
   Human studies of both short- and long-term exposures to combustion
   emissions and ambient fine particulate air pollution have been
   associated with measures of genetic damage. Long-term epidemiologic
   studies have reported an increased risk of all causes of mortality,
   cardiopulmonary mortality, and lung cancer mortality associated with
   increasing exposures to air pollution. Adverse reproductive effects
   (e.g., risk for low birth weight) have also recently been reported in
   Eastern Europe and North America. Although there is substantial evidence
   that PAH or substituted PAH may be causative agents in cancer and
   reproductive effects, an increasing number of studies investigating

   particulate matter {[}<= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5)] have
   increased since preindustrial times in urban and rural regions and are
   associated with cardiovascular and respiratory mortality.
   OBJECTIVES: We estimated the global burden of mortality due to O-3 and
   PM2.5 from anthropogenic emissions using global atmospheric chemical
   transport model simulations of preindustrial and present-day (2000)
   concentrations to derive exposure estimates.
   METHODS: Attributable mortalities were estimated using health impact
   functions based on long-term relative risk estimates for O-3 and PM2.5
   from the epidemiology literature. Using simulated concentrations rather
   than previous methods based on measurements allows the inclusion of
   rural areas where measurements are often unavailable and avoids making
   assumptions for background air pollution.
   RESULTS: Anthropogenic O-3 was associated with an estimated 0.7 +/- 0.3
   million respiratory mortalities (6.3 +/- 3.0 million years of life lost)
   annually. Anthropogenic PM2.5 was associated with 3.5 +/- 0.9 million
   cardiopulmonary and 220,000 +/- 80,000 lung cancer mortalities (30 +/-
   7.6 million years of life lost) annually. Mortality estimates were
   reduced approximately 30\% when we assumed low-concentration thresholds
   of 33.3 ppb for O-3 and 5.8 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5. These estimates were
   sensitive to concentration thresholds and concentration-mortality
   relationships, often by > 50\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anthropogenic O-3 and PM2.5 contribute substantially to
   global premature mortality. PM2.5 mortality estimates are about 50\%
   higher than previous measurement-based estimates based on common
   assumptions, mainly because of methodologic differences. Specifically,
   we included rural populations, suggesting higher estimates; however, the

   Objective: To undertake a global assessment of mortality associated with
   long-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution using remote
   sensing data.
   Methods: Global PM2.5 exposure levels were derived from the MODIS and

   mortality were modeled using previously developed concentration-response
   functions for the association between PM2.5 and mortality.
   Results: The global fraction of adult mortality attributable to the

   decades, many studies highlighted the role of ambient airborne
   particulate matter (PM) as an important environmental pollutant for many
   different cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer. Numerous
   epidemiological studies in the past 30 years found a strong
   exposure-response relationship between PM for short-term effects
   premature mortality, hospital admissions) and long-term or cumulative
   health effects (morbidity, lung cancer, cardiovascular and
   cardiopulmonary diseases, etc). Current research on airborne
   particle-induced health effects investigates the critical
   characteristics of particulate matter that determine their biological
   effects. Several independent groups of investigators have shown that the
   size of the airborne particles and their surface area determine the
   potential to elicit inflammatory injury, oxidative damage, and other
   biological effects. These effects are stronger for fine and ultrafine
   particles because they can penetrate deeper into the airways of the
   respiratory tract and can reach the alveoli in which 50\% are retained
   in the lung parenchyma. Composition of the PM varies greatly and depends
   on many factors. The major components of PM are transition metals, ions
   (sulfate, nitrate), organic compound, quinoid stable radicals of
   carbonaceous material, minerals, reactive gases, and materials of
   biologic origin. Results from toxicological research have shown that PM
   have several mechanisms of adverse cellular effects, such as
   cytotoxicity through oxidative stress mechanisms, oxygen-free
   radical-generating activity, DNA oxidative damage, mutagenicity, and
   stimulation of proinflammatory factors. In this review, the results of
   the most recent epidemiological and toxicological studies are
   summarized. In general, the evaluation of most of these studies shows
   that the smaller the size of PM the higher the toxicity through
   mechanisms of oxidative stress and inflammation. Some studies showed
   that the extractable organic compounds (a variety of chemicals with
   mutagenic and cytotoxic properties) contribute to various mechanisms of
   cytotoxicity; in addition, the water-soluble faction (mainly transition
   metals with redox potential) play an important role in the initiation of
   oxidative DNA damage and membrane lipid peroxidation. Associations
   between chemical compositions and particle toxicity tend to be stronger
   for the fine and ultrafine PM size fractions. Vehicular exhaust
   particles are found to be most responsible for small-sized airborne PM
   air pollution in urban areas. With these aspects in mind, future
   research should aim at establishing a cleared picture of the cytotoxic
   and carcinogenic mechanisms of PM in the lungs, as well as mechanisms of
   formation during internal engine combustion processes and other sources

   Swedish school children during the period 1978-2007. The objective was
   to study the effect of the proximity to lead sources based on the
   children's home and school location.
   Methods: The children's home address and school location were geocoded
   and their proximity to a lead smelter and major roads was calculated
   using geographical information system (GIS) software. All the
   statistical analyses were carried out using means of generalized
   log-linear modelling, with natural-logarithm-transformed B-Pb, adjusted
   for sex, school year, lead-exposing hobby, country of birth and, in the
   periods 1988-1994 and 1995-2007, parents' smoking habits.
   Results: The GIS analysis revealed that although the emission from the
   smelter and children's BPb levels had decreased considerably since 1978,
   proximity to the lead smelter continued to affect levels of B-Pb, even
   in recent years (geometric mean: near smelter: 22.90 mu g/l; far from
   smelter 19.75 mu g/l; p = 0.001). The analysis also revealed that
   proximity to major roads noticeably affected the children's B-Pb levels
   during the period 1978-1987 (geometric mean near major roads: 44.26 mu

   amount of lead in petrol. This effect was, however, not visible after

   Conclusion: The results show that proximity to the lead smelter still
   has an impact on the children's B-Pb levels. This is alarming since it
   could imply that living or working in the vicinity of a former lead
   source could pose a threat years after reduction of the emission. The
   analysis also revealed that urban children exposed to lead from traffic
   were only affected during the early period, when there were considerable

   outside of North America and Europe due in part to challenges in
   population exposure assessment. We assessed the feasibility of two
   current exposure assessment techniques, land use regression (LUR)
   modeling and mobile monitoring, and estimated the mortality attributable
   to air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. We developed LUR models for
   predicting wintertime spatial patterns of NO2 and SO2 based on 2-week
   passive Ogawa measurements at 37 locations and freely available
   geographic predictors. The models explained 74\% and 78\% of the
   variance in NO2 and SO2, respectively. Land cover characteristics
   derived from satellite images were useful predictors of both pollutants.
   Mobile PM2.5 monitoring with an integrating nephelometer also showed
   promise, capturing substantial spatial variation in PM2.5
   concentrations. The spatial patterns in SO2 and PM, seasonal and diurnal
   patterns in PM2.5, and high wintertime PM2.5/PM10 ratios were consistent
   with a major impact from coal and wood combustion in the city's
   low-income traditional housing (ger) areas. The annual average
   concentration of PM2.5 measured at a centrally located government
   monitoring site was 75 mu g/m(3) or more than seven times the World
   Health Organization's PM2.5 air quality guideline, driven by a
   wintertime average concentration of 148 mu g/m(3). PM2.5 concentrations
   measured in a traditional housing area were higher, with a wintertime
   mean PM2.5 concentration of 250 mu g/m(3). We conservatively estimated
   that 29\% (95\% CI, 12-43\%) of cardiopulmonary deaths and 40\% (95\%
   CI, 17-56\%) of lung cancer deaths in the city are attributable to
   outdoor air pollution. These deaths correspond to nearly 10\% of the
   city's total mortality, with estimates ranging to more than 13\% of
   mortality under less conservative model assumptions. LUR models and
   mobile monitoring can be successfully implemented in developing country
   cities, thus cost-effectively improving exposure assessment for
   epidemiology and risk assessment. Air pollution represents a major
   threat to public health in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and reducing home
   heating emissions in traditional housing areas should be the primary
   focus of air pollution control efforts.}","{10.1007/s11869-011-0154-3}","{1873-9318}","{ISI:000315357800012}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   fine particles (aerodynamic diameter >= 5 2.5 mu m; PM2.5) and
   mortality. However, concerns have been raised regarding the sensitivity
   of the results to model specifications, lower exposures, and averaging

   OBJECTIVE: We addressed these issues using 11 additional years of
   follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities study, incorporating recent lower
   exposures.
   METHODS: We replicated the previously applied Cox regression, and
   examined different time lags, the shape of the concentration response
   relationship using penalized splines, and changes in the slope of the
   relation over time. We then conducted Poisson survival analysis with
   time-varying effects for smoking, sex, and education.
   RESULTS: Since 2001, average PM2.5 levels, for all six cities, were < 18
   mu g/m(3). Each increase in PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) was associated with an
   adjusted increased risk of all-cause mortality (PM2.5 average on
   previous year) of 14\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 7, 22], and
   with 26\% (95\% CI: 14, 40) and 37\% (95\% CI: 7, 75) increases in

   previous years), respectively. The concentration response relationship
   was linear down to PM2.5 concentrations of 8 mu g/m(3). Mortality rate
   ratios for PM2.5 fluctuated over time, but without clear trends despite
   a substantial drop in the sulfate fraction. Poisson models produced

   stronger association of air pollution exposure with cardiovascular
   mortality and morbidity, particularly related to atherothrombotic
   (coronary and cerebrovascular) disease. Particulate matter (PM), mainly
   that with lower aerodynamic diameter (fine and ultrafine PM), is
   responsible for the most severe effects, due to its capacity to
   transport toxic substances deep into the lower airways. These effects

   ozone on air pollution-related mortality remains uncertain. We examined
   the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the risk of death
   from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory
   causes.
   Methods: Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society
   Cancer Prevention Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from
   96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. Data were
   analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year
   follow-up period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were
   obtained from April 1 to September 30 for the years 1977 through 2000.
   Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that are
   lessthan/equal 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter {[}PM(sub 2.5)]) were
   obtained for the years 1999 and 2000. Associations between ozone
   concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of
   standard and multilevel Cox regression models.
   Results: In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either
   PM(sub 2.5) or ozone were significantly associated with an increased
   risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-pollutant models,
   PM(sub 2.5) was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular
   causes, whereas ozone was associated with the risk of death from
   respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of death from
   respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone
   concentration of 10 ppb was 1.040 (95\% confidence interval, 1.010 to

   causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of
   statistical model used.
   Conclusions: In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect
   of ozone on the risk of death from cardiovascular causes when the
   concentration of PM(sub 2.5) was taken into account. We did, however,
   demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of death from respiratory

   mortality from all causes, cancer, and cardiopulmonary diseases. To
   determine potential effects of these particles on human health, human
   bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS- 2B) were cultured with PM2.5 collected
   from various locations in the Cache Valley. These particles were
   slightly cytotoxic, but more potent than NH4NO3, the major chemical

   PM2.5-exposed cells was performed using microarray and quantitative
   reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR.) Among other

   significant gene level upregulation of activating receptors to
   interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1R1 and IL-6R), as well as concomitant

   Objectives: To investigate the impact of pictorial health warnings
   conveyed by the Brazilian tobacco control programme through a
   well-established psychometric tool designed for studies on emotion and
   behaviour.
   Methods: Graphic Brazilian cigarette warnings labels were evaluated.
   They consisted of the two sets of warning pictures displayed in 2002-4
   (n = 9) and 2004-8 (n = 10). Pleasant, unpleasant and neutral pictures

   Results: The judgements of hedonic content of the warning pictures
   ranged from neutral to very unpleasant. None was classified as highly

   Conclusion: Previous studies have shown that the most threatening and
   arousing pictures prompt the greatest evidence of defensive activation.
   Emotional ratings of Brazilian warning pictures described them as
   unpleasant but moderately arousing. To intensify avoidance of the
   packages, future graphic warnings should therefore generate more
   arousal. The ratings for the Brazilian warning pictures indicated that,

   IQ in children aged 5 or more and their body burden of lead.
   Design-A systematic review of 26 epidemiological studies since 1979:
   prospective studies of birth cohorts, cross sectional studies of blood
   lead, and cross sectional studies of tooth lead.
   Setting-General populations of children greater than or equal to 5
   years.
   Main outcome measures-For each study, the regression coefficient of IQ
   on lead, after adjustment for confounders when possible, was used to
   derive the estimated change in IQ for a specific doubling of either
   blood or tooth lead.
   Results-The five prospective studies with over 1100 children showed no
   association of cord blood lead or antenatal maternal blood lead with
   subsequent IQ. Blood lead at around age 2 had a small and significant
   inverse association with IQ, somewhat greater than that for mean blood
   lead over the preschool years. The 14 cross sectional studies of blood
   lead with 3499 children showed a significant inverse association
   overall, but showed more variation in their results and their ability to
   allow for confounders. The seven cross sectional studies of tooth lead
   with 2095 children were more consistent in finding an inverse
   association, although the estimated:magnitude was somewhat smaller.
   Overall synthesis of this evidence, including a meta-analysis, indicates
   that a typical doubling of body lead burden (from 10 to 20 mu g/dl (0.48
   to 0.97 mu mol/l) blood lead or from 5 to 10 mu g/g tooth lead) is
   associated with a mean deficit in full scale IQ of around 1-2 IQ points.
   Conclusion-While low level lead exposure may cause a small IQ deficit,
   other explanations need considering: are the published studies
   representative; is there inadequate allowance for confounders; are there
   selection biases in recruiting and following children; and do children
   of lower IQ adopt behaviour which makes them more prone to lead uptake
   (reverse causality)? Even if moderate increases in body lead burden
   adversely affect IQ, a threshold below which there is negligible
   influence cannot currently be determined. Because of these
   uncertainties, the degree of public health priority that should be
   devoted to detecting and reducing moderate increases in children's blood
   lead, compared with other important social detriments that impede
   children's development, needs careful consideration.}",NA,"{0959-8138}","{ISI:A1994PQ66200018}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   consistently been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The
   relationship between exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) and health
   effects is less firmly established. If UFP cause health effects
   independently from coarser fractions, this could affect health impact
   assessment of air pollution, which would possibly lead to alternative
   policy options to be considered to reduce the disease burden of PM.
   Therefore, we organized an expert elicitation workshop to assess the
   evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to UFP and health
   endpoints.
   Methods: An expert elicitation on the health effects of ambient
   ultrafine particle exposure was carried out, focusing on: 1) the
   likelihood of causal relationships with key health endpoints, and 2) the
   likelihood of potential causal pathways for cardiac events. Based on a
   systematic peernomination procedure, fourteen European experts
   (epidemiologists, toxicologists and clinicians) were selected, of whom
   twelve attended. They were provided with a briefing book containing key
   literature. After a group discussion, individual expert judgments in the
   form of ratings of the likelihood of causal relationships and pathways
   were obtained using a confidence scheme adapted from the one used by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
   Results: The likelihood of an independent causal relationship between
   increased short-term UFP exposure and increased all-cause mortality,
   hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,
   aggravation of asthma symptoms and lung function decrements was rated
   medium to high by most experts. The likelihood for long-term UFP
   exposure to be causally related to all cause mortality, cardiovascular
   and respiratory morbidity and lung cancer was rated slightly lower,
   mostly medium. The experts rated the likelihood of each of the six
   identified possible causal pathways separately. Out of these six, the
   highest likelihood was rated for the pathway involving respiratory
   inflammation and subsequent thrombotic effects.
   Conclusion: The overall medium to high likelihood rating of causality of
   health effects of UFP exposure and the high likelihood rating of at
   least one of the proposed causal mechanisms explaining associations
   between UFP and cardiac events, stresses the importance of considering
   UFP in future health impact assessments of (transport-related) air

   input variables and assumptions which have to be incorporated into the
   model structure. These uncertainties may have significant effects on the
   results obtained with model, and, thus, on decision making. Fine
   particles ( PM(2.5)) are believed to cause major health impacts, and,
   consequently, uncertainties in their health impact assessment have clear
   relevance to policy- making. We studied the effects of various uncertain
   input variables by building a life- table model for fine particles.
   Methods: Life- expectancy of the Helsinki metropolitan area population
   and the change in lifeexpectancy due to fine particle exposures were
   predicted using a life- table model. A number of parameter and model
   uncertainties were estimated. Sensitivity analysis for input variables
   was performed by calculating rank- order correlations between input and
   output variables. The studied model uncertainties were ( i) plausibility
   of mortality outcomes and ( ii) lag, and parameter uncertainties ( iii)
   exposure- response coefficients for different mortality outcomes, and (
   iv) exposure estimates for different age groups. The monetary value of
   the years- of- life- lost and the relative importance of the
   uncertainties related to monetary valuation were predicted to compare
   the relative importance of the monetary valuation on the health effect
   uncertainties.
   Results: The magnitude of the health effects costs depended mostly on
   discount rate, exposure-response coefficient, and plausibility of the
   cardiopulmonary mortality. Other mortality outcomes ( lung cancer, other
   non- accidental and infant mortality) and lag had only minor impact on
   the output. The results highlight the importance of the uncertainties
   associated with cardiopulmonary mortality in the fine particle impact
   assessment when compared with other uncertainties.
   Conclusion: When estimating life- expectancy, the estimates used for
   cardiopulmonary exposure-response coefficient, discount rate, and

   on health care costs in patients with T2DM and in a matched comparison
   group of patients without diabetes.
   METHODS: This study involved retrospective analysis of administrative
   claims (eligibility, pharmacy, and medical) using data from a commercial
   health maintenance organization population of approximately 700,000
   members in an East Coast health plan. Patients were included in this
   study if they (a) had 2 or more claims for T2DM (international
   Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
   {[}ICD-9-CM] codes 250.X0 or 250.X2), or (b) had a prescription drug
   claim for insulin and a diagnosis of T2DM, or (c) had at least I
   pharmacy claim for an oral glycemic-modifying agent during the 12-month
   period from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2003. Patients with 2
   or more medical claims for type 1 diabetes (ICD-9-CM codes 25011 or
   25013) were excluded from the study. A random group of comparison
   patients without diabetes (ICD-9 code 250.xx) were matched on age group
   and sex. Study patients in these 2 groups were subdivided into 4 groups
   based on the presence of medical claims with diagnosis codes for MVD
   (acute myocardial infarction, other ischemic heart disease, coronary
   artery bypass surgery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, congestive
   heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disease,
   cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease). Direct
   medical costs were aggregated for 12 months after the index date for
   patients in all 4 groups. Bootstrapping technique was used to compare
   the health care costs between patients with T2DM and those without
   diabetes, stratified by MVD status.
   RESULTS: A total of 9,059 patients with T2DM were identified and were
   matched by age group and sex to a random group of patients without
   diabetes. MVD was present in 26.9\% (n = 2,441) of patients with T2DM
   versus 11.3\% (n = 1,027) of patients without diabetes. Patients with
   MVD and T2DM were, on average, a year younger than patients with MVD but
   without diabetes (54.55 vs. 55.55 years, P <0.001). Patients with T2DM
   but without MVD were nearly the same age as patients with neither
   diabetes nor MVD (50.44 vs. 50.59 years, P=0.092). The T2DM patients
   with MVD had average 12-month costs more than 3 times the costs for
   patients with T2DM but without medical claims with diagnosis codes for
   MVD-\$10,450 versus \$3,385, respectively. Pharmacy costs accounted for
   29.0\% and inpatient hospital costs accounted for 43.9\% of total
   medical costs in T2DM patients with MVD versus 55.0\% and 17.3\%,
   respectively, in T2DM patients without MVD. Patients with MVD diagnoses
   and T2DM had total average medical costs that were 1.7 times the total
   medical costs for MVD patients without T2DM-\$10,450 versus \$6,090,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis suggest that MVD may triple
   the total medical care costs in patients with T2DM. These economic
   consequences would appear to support the importance of interventions
   intended to prevent macrovascular events in patients with T2DM.}",NA,"{1083-4087}","{ISI:000241356000002}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   I) and pravastatin, lipids and atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries
   (PLAC II) studies. The PLAC I and II trials have shown that pravastatin
   treatment for 3 years at a weighted mean dose of 36.64 mg daily
   significantly reduced the incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction
   in patients with CHD. Framingham data were used to project the risk of
   mortality 10 years post-myocardial infarction. The incremental cost per
   life year gained (LYG), after discounting costs and benefits by 5\%
   annually, in the setting of Belgian health care regulations, was Belgian
   francs (BEF) 720 794 (US\$ 24 359) for CHD patients with one additional
   risk factor; BEF 526 464 (US\$ 17 792) for those with two additional
   risk factors; and BEF 392 765 (US\$ 13 274) for those with three or more
   additional risk factors. The cost per LYG in Belgium appeared to be more
   sensitive to drug acquisition cost than to costs of medical
   interventions. The cost-effectiveness ratios of pravastatin monotherapy
   for 3 years in secondary prevention of CHD, obtained with the same
   projected risk model, are from 86 to 92\% higher in Belgium than in the
   United States, due to differences in medical patterns of practice and in
   intervention costs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights

   (CT) coronary angiography as a triage test, performed prior to
   conventional coronary angiography, by using a Markov model.
   Materials and Methods: A Markov model was used to analyze the
   cost-effectiveness of CT coronary angiography performed as a triage test
   prior to conventional coronary angiography from the perspective of the
   patient, physician, hospital, health care system, and society by using
   recommendations from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the
   Netherlands for cost-effectiveness analyses. For CT coronary
   angiography, a range of sensitivities (79\%-100\%) and specificities
   (63\%-94\%) were used to help diagnose significant coronary artery
   disease (CAD). Optimization criteria (ie, outcomes considered) were:
   revised posttest probability of CAD, life-years, quality-adjusted
   life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
   (ICERs). Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed.
   Results: For a prior probability of CAD of less than 40\%, the
   probability of CAD after CT coronary angiography with negative results
   was less than 1\%. The Markov model calculations from the
   patient/physician perspective suggest that CT coronary angiography
   maximizes life-years respectively in 60-year-old men and women at a
   prior probability of less than 38\% and 24\% and maximizes QALYs at a
   prior probability of less than 17\% and 11\%. From the hospital/health
   care perspective, CT coronary angiography helps reduce health care and
   direct nonhealth care-related costs (according to UK/U.S.
   recommendations), regardless of prior probability, and lowers all costs,
   including production losses (Netherlands recommendations) at a prior
   probability of less than 87\%-92\%. Analysis performed from a societal
   perspective by using a willingness-to-pay threshold level of (sic)80
   000/QALY suggests that CT coronary angiography is cost-effective when
   the prior probability is lower than 44\% and 37\% in men and women,
   respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that results changed across
   the reported range of sensitivity of CT coronary angiography.
   Conclusion: The optimal diagnostic work-up depends on the optimization
   criterion, prior probability of CAD, and the diagnostic performance of
   CT coronary angiography. (C) RSNA, 2009}","{10.1148/radiol.2533090507}","{0033-8419}","{ISI:000272247300020}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"{94th Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the

   coronary artery disease (CAD). Chronic angina is a debilitating
   condition that affects millions of people in the United States.
   Objective: The objective of the study is to estimate, from a societal
   perspective, the direct costs of chronic angina in the year 2000.
   Methods: Data on medical utilization related to chronic angina were
   extracted from National Center for Health Statistics public-use
   databases and from IMS databases on medications (nitrates,
   beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers). National average Medicare
   reimbursement rates were used to estimate costs. We identified medical
   utilization related to chronic angina based on International
   Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. When ICD-9
   codes that do not explicitly identify angina are used in medical
   databases, people with chronic angina may be coded as having CAD only.
   To address this, we developed upper- and lower-boundary estimates of the
   costs of chronic angina. The lower-boundary estimate is based on
   diagnoses that narrowly define the presence of chronic angina, and is
   termed ``narrowly defined chronic angina.{''} The upper-boundary
   estimate is based on diagnoses of CAD.
   Results: The lower boundary on the cost of chronic angina is the
   estimated direct medical cost of narrowly defined chronic angina (\$1.9
   billion when it is the first-listed diagnosis and \$8.9 billion when it
   is listed in any position). The upper boundary on the cost of chronic
   angina is the estimated total direct medical cost of CAD, which is \$33
   billion when it is the first-listed diagnosis and \$75 billion when it
   is listed in any position.
   Conclusion: These analyses capture the range of direct costs that might
   be attributed to the care of chronic angina in the United States for the
   year 2000. Some components of care were not available, and estimated
   costs will be significantly higher if private payer reimbursement rates

   (HDL)-cholesterol is an independent risk factor for coronary heart
   disease (CHD). Fibrates, particularly gemfibrozil, have been shown to
   raise HDL-cholesterol levels and reduce the incidence of CHD. The
   literature on fibrate cost effectiveness is quite limited.
   Objective: The objective of this analysis is to determine the cost
   effectiveness of the fibrates gemfibrozil and fenofibrate in the primary
   prevention of CHD. The target population includes patients with low
   levels of HDL-cholesterol, but without pre-existing CHD or other CHD
   risk factors sufficiently elevated to indicate drug therapy.
   Study design and methods: From a societal perspective, a lifetime
   incremental cost-effectiveness model was developed to calculate baseline
   and treatment costs, life-years gained and QALYs gained. Model parameter
   values were taken from existing literature. In this `backward induction'
   model, the expected costs and outcomes for each 5-year time-interval are
   utilised in subsequent 5-year time period calculations over the
   patient's entire lifetime. The study population consisted of a
   hypothetical cohort of males and females in the US aged 45-74 years,
   with low levels of HDL-cholesterol and no prior history of CHD. The
   base-case CHD risk factors for this population were obtained from the
   VA-HIT (Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol
   Intervention Trial) population baseline characteristics, but assuming no
   prior CHD history. Estimates for the reduction in CHD risk associated
   with fibrate therapy reduction are also taken from the VA-HIT study.
   Results: Using a societal cost-effectiveness threshold of \$US50 000 per
   QALY, primary prevention of CHD in patients with low HDL-cholesterol
   levels using generic gemfibrozil therapy is cost effective for all age
   and sex categories, in contrast to fenofibrate therapy, which is cost
   effective for males, but not for females at baseline risks levels. In
   the base-case scenario, because of their higher CHD lifetime risk, it is
   more cost effective to treat males than females with either gemfibrozil
   or fenofibrate. For males and females the cost per QALY decreases with
   age for most age intervals. Gemfibrozil is more cost effective than
   fenofibrate for all age-sex categories because of the assumed equal
   efficacy and the higher fenofibrate drug cost. In the comparison
   scenario, generic lovastatin was more cost effective than gemfibrozil
   for men except at age 45 years and women at all ages, and more cost
   effective than fenofibrate for both men and women.
   Conclusions: This analysis suggests that fibrate therapy, particularly
   with generic. gemfibrozil, is cost effective in the primary prevention
   of CHD in individuals with low HDL-cholesterol levels, with or without
   elevated triglyceride levels. Certain patient subgroups, such as those
   with elevated triglyceride levels, smokers and those with diabetes
   mellitus are likely to achieve both CHD risk reduction and overall
   savings in net expected medical care costs. Comparable
   cost-effectiveness results are also shown for lovastatin therapy in the
   target patient population. Gemfibrozil dominates fenofibrate because of
   the lower cost of therapy (direct and indirect costs). These conclusions
   are robust to reasonable changes in model parameter values.}","{10.2165/00019053-200523020-00005}","{1170-7690}","{ISI:000227889700005}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   Results:
   Of the 11,266 ACS patients identified for analysis in the health system

   While many interventions are recommended to prevent CVD, the potential
   effects of a comprehensive set of prevention activities on CVD
   morbidity, mortality, and costs have never been evaluated. We therefore
   determined the effects of I I nationally recommended prevention
   activities on CVD-related morbidity, mortality, and costs in the U.S.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We used person-specific data from a
   representative sample of the U.S. population (National Health and
   Nutrition Education Survey IV) to determine the number and
   characteristics of adults aged 20-80 years in the U.S. today who are
   candidates for different prevention activities related to CVD. We used
   the Archimedes model to create a simulated population that matched the
   real U.S. population, person by person. We then used the model to
   simulate a series of clinical trials that examined the effects over the
   next 30 years of applying each prevention activity one by one, or
   altogether, to those who are candidates for the various activities and
   compared the health outcomes, quality of life, and direct medical costs
   to current levels of prevention and care. We did this under two sets of
   assumptions about performance and compliance: 100\% success for each
   activity and lower levels of success considered aggressive but still
   feasible.
   RESULTS - Approximately 78\% of adults aged 20-80 years alive today in
   the U.S. are candidates for at least one prevention activity. if
   everyone received the activities for which they are eligible, myocardial
   infarctions and strokes would be reduced by similar to 63\% and 31\%,
   respectively. If more feasible levels of performance are assumed,
   myocardial infarctions and strokes would be reduced similar to 36\% and
   20\%, respectively. Implementation of all prevention activities would
   add similar to 221 million life-years and 244 million quality-adjusted
   life-years to the U.S. adult population over the coming 30 years, or an
   average of 1.3 years of life expectancy for all adults. Of the specific
   prevention activities, the greatest benefits to the U.S. population come
   from providing aspirin to high-risk individuals, controlling
   pre-diabetes, weight reduction in obese individuals, lowering blood
   pressure in people with diabetes, and lowering LDL cholesterol in people
   with existing coronary artery disease (CAD). As currently delivered and
   at current prices, Most prevention activities are expensive when
   considering direct medical costs; smoking cessation is the only
   prevention strategy that is cost-saving over 30 years,
   CONCLUSIONS - Aggressive application of nationally recommended
   prevention activities could prevent a high proportion of the CAD events
   and strokes that are otherwise expected to occur in adults in the U.S.
   today. However, as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention
   activities will substantially increase costs. If preventive strategies
   are to achieve their full potential, ways must be found to reduce the
   costs and deliver prevention activities more efficiently.}","{10.2337/dc08-9022}","{0149-5992}","{ISI:000258482000044}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   management, the risk of major cardiovascular events, and lost

   Objective: This study sought to assemble best evidence on the economic
   burden of chronic angina, including both the direct costs of healthcare
   and the indirect costs of lost productivity.
   Methods: Studies published in English from January 1990 to June 2003
   were located via electronic and manual searches and systematically
   reviewed. Eligible studies included those with information on cost of
   illness, cost of treatment, employment status, and/or work productivity
   and/or limitations for a population of patients with chronic angina.
   Results: Seventeen studies assessed the healthcare cost of managing
   chronic angina. Cost estimates varied widely because of differing
   patient populations, healthcare settings, countries of origin, and
   year(s) of data collection. The most critical determinant of healthcare
   costs appeared to be the use of revascularization procedures. Twenty
   studies reported work limitations, 5 of which quantified productivity
   loss in monetary terms. Interventions for chronic angina resulted in
   some improvement in employment and work limitations over the short term.
   However, the positive effect of revascularization procedures tended to
   erode over the long term (3 years and beyond) in a substantial number of
   patients.
   Conclusions: Chronic angina carries substantial healthcare costs caused
   by frequent medical visits, medications, and expensive revascularization
   procedures. Workplace productivity loss because of angina is also
   substantial, but lasting long-term improvement in work status has been

   adiposity on national life expectancy and on disparities in life
   expectancy and disease-specific mortality among eight subgroups of the
   US population (the ``Eight Americas{''}) defined on the basis of race
   and the location and socioeconomic characteristics of county of
   residence, in 2005.
   Methods and Findings: We combined data from the National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System to estimate unbiased risk factor levels for the Eight Americas.
   We used data from the National Center for Health Statistics to estimate
   age-sex-disease-specific number of deaths in 2005. We used systematic
   reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies to obtain risk factor
   effect sizes for disease-specific mortality. We used epidemiologic
   methods for multiple risk factors to estimate the effects of current
   exposure to these risk factors on death rates, and life table methods to
   estimate effects on life expectancy. Asians had the lowest mean body
   mass index, fasting plasma glucose, and smoking; whites had the lowest
   systolic blood pressure (SBP). SBP was highest in blacks, especially in
   the rural South-5-7 mmHg higher than whites. The other three risk
   factors were highest in Western Native Americans, Southern low-income
   rural blacks, and/or low-income whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi
   Valley. Nationally, these four risk factors reduced life expectancy at
   birth in 2005 by an estimated 4.9 y in men and 4.1 y in women. Life
   expectancy effects were smallest in Asians (M, 4.1 y; F, 3.6 y) and
   largest in Southern rural blacks (M, 6.7 y; F, 5.7 y). Standard
   deviation of life expectancies in the Eight Americas would decline by
   0.50 y (18\%) in men and 0.45 y (21\%) in women if these risks had been
   reduced to optimal levels. Disparities in the probabilities of dying
   from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at different ages would
   decline by 69\%-80\%; the corresponding reduction for probabilities of
   dying from cancers would be 29\%-50\%. Individually, smoking and high

   six types of potentially preventable cancer in the United States.
   Methods. A total of 1,579,310 patients diagnosed with cancers of the
   lung, colon and rectum, liver, breast, cervix, or prostate in 1992-2005
   were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   registries. The lifetime survival functions for the cancer cohort and
   age-/sex-matched reference population were generated using a
   semiparametric extrapolation method with annual life tables. The average
   expected years of life lost (EYLL) for cancers were calculated by
   subtracting the estimated life expectancy of the cancer cohorts from
   that of the reference population.
   Results. Liver cancer and lung cancer had an average EYLL of over 13
   years, while the EYLL for prostate cancer was below 2 years. When
   considering the annual incidence in 2012, lung cancer would cause the

   increases in survival and quality of life, but at a population-level the
   effect on life expectancy is not well understood. Our objective was to
   compare changes in mortality and life expectancy among HIV-positive
   individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy.
   Methods The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration is a
   multinational collaboration of HIV cohort studies in Europe and North
   America. Patients were included in this analysis if they were aged 16
   years or over and antiretroviral-naive when initiating combination
   therapy. We constructed abridged life tables to estimate life
   expectancies for individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy in
   1996-99, 2000-02, and 2003-05, and stratified by sex, baseline CD4 cell
   count, and history of injecting drug use. The average number of years
   remaining to be lived by those treated with combination antiretroviral
   therapy at 20 and 35 years of age was estimated. Potential years of life
   lost from 20 to 64 years of age and crude mortality rates were also
   calculated.
   Findings 18 587, 13 914, and 10 854 eligible patients initiated
   combination antiretroviral therapy in 1996-99, 2000-02, and 2003-05,
   respectively. 2056 (4.7\%) deaths were observed during the study period,
   with crude mortality rates decreasing from 16.3 deaths per 1000
   person-years in 1996-99 to 10 . 0 deaths per 1000 person-years in
   2003-05. Potential years of life lost per 1000 person-years also
   decreased over the same time, from 366 to 189 years. Life expectancy at
   age 20 years increased from 36. 1 (S E 0 . 6) years to 49.4 (0.5) years.
   Women had higher life expectancies than did men. Patients with presumed
   transmission via injecting drug use had lower life expectancies than did
   those from other transmission groups (32.6 {[}1. 1] years vs 44.7
   {[}0.3] years in 2003-05). Life expectancy was lower in patients with
   lower baseline CD4 cell counts than in those with higher baseline counts
   (32.4 {[}1. 1] years for CD4 cell counts below 100 cells per mu L vs
   50.4 {[}0.4] years for counts of 200 cells per mu L or more).
   Interpretation life expectancy in HIV-infected patients treated with
   combination antiretroviral therapy increased between 1996 and 2005,
   although there is considerable variability between subgroups of
   patients. The average number of years remaining to be lived at age 20

   and smaller declines in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden
   (approximately one fourth). Similar rates of decline would be observed
   in terms of potential gain in life expectancy. Because of population
   aging, the absolute number of stroke deaths would decline slowly in the
   United Kingdom and France and stabilize or even increase in other
   countries.
   Conclusions-In the near future, stroke may lose much of its effects on
   life expectancy but remain a frequent cause of death among elderly
   populations. The prevention of stroke-related disability instead of
   mortality may become increasingly more important. (Stroke.

   There have been two organized studies, and a number of anecdotal
   reports, describing the decline in cardiac arrest resuscitation research
   in the United States since the implementation of the Final Rule. Paradis
   and colleagues found that the volume of human cardiac arrest research
   published in the United States was significantly less in a four-year
   period after the Final Rule was adopted as compared to the earlier
   period. Nichol and colleagues reported that both the absolute number of
   US-based randomized cardiac arrest trials and the proportion of US-based
   trials (vs. foreign trials, based on the mailing address of the first
   author) decreased by about 15\% annually. Despite the concern about a
   negative impact, there are at least five published trials, one in
   progress and one in planning that have been or are being conducted under
   the regulations. Those completed include the Diaspirin Cross-Linked
   Hemoglobin, Public Access Defibrillation, Multicenter Vest CPR,
   Brain-CPR, and Pre-Hospital Treatment of Status Epilepticus trials.
   Reports of how investigators met the regulations and their experience in
   doing so are reviewed. A summary table of the federal regulations is

   research about using the regulations would be helpful for the promotion
   of quality resuscitation and emergency care research in the United

   increased bone turnover in bone metastases. Alpha particles account for
   95\% of the 27.8 MeV emitted per decay. Less than 2\% of the emissions
   are from photons. This means that a high absorbed dose will be delivered
   locally, although the number of photons for imaging will be low. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of quantitative
   imaging of Ra-223 to enable biodistribution studies.
   Methods A Philips Forte gamma camera, equipped with a medium-energy
   collimator, was used. Basic imaging parameters were determined from
   phantom studies, and the accuracy of activity quantification was tested
   in a phantom study and within a patient study.
   Results Imaging parameters were determined for the three most suitable
   photon peaks from the acquired energy spectrum (82, 154 and 270 keV).
   Camera sensitivity is constant for circular sources with areas greater
   than 10 cm(2). The spatial resolution (full-width at half-maximum) was
   1.1 cm for each of the three energy windows. The possibility for
   quantitative imaging was further investigated for the 82 keV energy
   window, which showed the highest sensitivity and spatial resolution. A
   phantom study showed that activity could be quantified to within 10\%
   for a 200 ml volume placed within water containing background activity
   and to within 50\% for a 0.5 ml phantom. Quantification of activity in
   bone after administrations of 100 kBq/kg of Ra-223-chloride proved the
   feasibility of quantitative imaging of patients who have received
   radionuclide therapy.
   Conclusion Because of the high-energy deposition of Ra-223, only a low
   injected activity is required for therapy, which results in a low count
   rate for the gamma camera. Nevertheless, this study has demonstrated
   that it is possible to quantify uptake with a sufficient degree of
   accuracy to obtain clinically relevant information. Nucl Med Commun

   in the EUROCARE-4 study for patients diagnosed in 1995-1999. Relative
   survival (RS) estimates are here updated for patients diagnosed with
   cancer of the oesophagus, stomach and small intestine from 2000 to 2007.
   Trends in RS from 1999-2001 to 2005-2007 are presented to monitor and
   discuss improvements in patient survival in Europe.
   Materials and methods: EUROCARE-5 data from 29 countries (87 cancer
   registries) were used to investigate 1- and 5-year RS. Using
   registry-specific life-tables stratified by age, gender and calendar
   year, age-standardised `complete analysis' RS estimates by country and
   region were calculated for Northern, Southern, Eastern and Central
   Europe, and for Ireland and United Kingdom (UK). Survival trends of
   patients in periods 1999-2001, 2002-2004 and 2005-2007 were investigated
   using the `period' RS approach. We computed the 5-year RS conditional on
   surviving the first year (5-year conditional survival), as the ratio of
   age-standardised 5-year RS to 1-year RS.
   Results: Oesophageal cancer 1- and 5-year RS (40\% and 12\%,
   respectively) remained poor in Europe. Patient survival was worst in
   Eastern (8\%), Northern (11\%) and Southern Europe (10\%). Europe-wide,
   there was a 3\% improvement in oesophageal cancer 5-year survival by
   2005-2007, with Ireland and the UK (3\%), and Central Europe (4\%)
   showing large improvements. Europe-wide, stomach cancer 5-year RS was
   25\%. Ireland and UK (17\%) and Eastern Europe (19\%) had the poorest
   5-year patient survival. Southern Europe had the best 5-year survival
   (30\%), though only showing an improvement of 2\% by 2005-2007. Small
   intestine cancer 5-year RS for Europe was 48\%, with Central Europe
   having the best (54\%), and Ireland and UK the poorest (37\%). Five-year
   patient survival improvement for Europe was 8\% by 2005-2007, with
   Central, Southern and Eastern Europe showing the greatest increases
   (P9\%).
   Conclusions: Survival for these cancer sites, particularly oesophageal
   cancer, remains poor in Europe with wide variation. Further
   investigation into the wide variation, including analysis by histology
   and anatomical sub-site, will yield insights to better monitor and
   explain the improvements in survival observed over time. (C) 2015

   and non-Indigenous Australians was 12 years for men and 10 years for
   women, whereas the Northern Territory Indigenous LE gap was at least
   50\% greater than the national figures. This study aims to explain the
   Indigenous LE gap by common modifiable risk factors.
   Methods: This study covered the period from 1986 to 2005. Unit record
   death data from the Northern Territory were used to assess the
   differences in LE at birth between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous
   populations by socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, alcohol abuse,
   obesity, pollution, and intimate partner violence. The population
   attributable fractions were applied to estimate the numbers of deaths
   associated with the selected risks. The standard life table and cause
   decomposition technique was used to examine the individual and joint
   effects on health inequality.
   Results: The findings from this study indicate that among the selected
   risk factors, socioeconomic disadvantage was the leading health risk and
   accounted for one-third to one-half of the Indigenous LE gap. A
   combination of all six selected risks explained over 60\% of the
   Indigenous LE gap.
   Conclusions: Improving socioeconomic status, smoking cessation, and
   overweight reduction are critical to closing the Indigenous LE gap. This

   electrification is the most energy-efficient way to power the trains.
   There are many existing solutions to supply the trains with electricity.
   Regardless of which particular technology is chosen, it is beneficial to
   interconnect the public power grids to grids supplying power to the
   railways. This paper shows that the most efficient, flexible, and
   gentle-for-the-public-grid way of doing that is through power
   electronic-based power converters. Converters offer great benefits
   regardless of whether the overhead contact lines are of DC-type or AC
   type, and regardless of the AC grid frequency.
   This paper presents neither new theory nor new experimental results.
   Based on already available information, this paper presents logical
   arguments leading to this conclusion from collected facts. Over time
   what used to be advanced and high-cost equipment earlier can nowadays be
   purchased at reasonable cost. It is obvious that for most
   electrically-fed railways, the use of modern power converters is
   attractive. Where the individual trains are high consumers of energy,
   the railway gradients are substantial, and the public grids feeding the
   railway are weak, the use of converters would be technically desirable,

   It is expected that more high-speed railways will be built, and more
   existing railways will be electrified in the foreseeable future. This

   transformations, driven by a greater demand for transparency and
   efficiency in a participative framework involving nonprofit
   organizations, enterprises, and citizens, with the modern network
   infrastructure as a common medium. The Open Data movement is considered
   one of the keys to this change. To the best of our knowledge, the
   current generation of Open Data has to date provided only static
   datasets in which no data concerning specific individuals could be
   included, due to obvious privacy issues. Public administrations hold a
   great deal of data of a personal kind, as do many private entities.
   Consider, for instance, the huge amount of personal data contributed to
   the various online social networks, or the electricity consumption data
   collected and stored by energy providers, or the telephone and internet
   data collected by telecommunications companies. The lack of such
   personal data in the Open Data realm, and the static nature of the
   released datasets, are weaknesses of the current generation of Open
   Data. Without personal data and without timeliness, it is impossible to
   build useful services tailored to the actual needs of a given individual
   at a given time. We argue that, by segregating or ``protecting{''} our
   personal data, those public and private entities become the ``owners{''}
   of our data. This means they hold a monopoly on services, while we, the
   legitimate owners of the data, must abide by their terms and conditions
   concerning how our data are treated and used. By unleashing personal
   data ``into the wild{''}, such a monopoly would collapse and a new
   ecosystem of personal services based on these data could flourish. Of
   course nobody wants personal data to enter the public domain without any
   control. We argue that an appropriate policy for online disclosure of
   personal data is one where the individuals are restored to their role of
   ``data owners{''} and are allowed to exert online control over data
   accesses being performed by third parties. This idea of ``smart
   disclosure{''} of personal data is expected to be one of the forthcoming
   evolutions of Open Data. Based on the above arguments, we propose a
   possible implementation of ``smart disclosure{''} that takes advantage
   of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. If properly implemented, OAuth
   2.0 guarantees access to selected personal data upon authorization by
   the individual data owner. An implementation is presented together with

   to 44\% in 2025. Among individuals with a degree qualification or
   higher, it will increase from 14\% to 30\%. If all current educational
   inequalities in weight change could be eliminated, the projected
   difference in the prevalence of obesity by 2025 between the highest and
   lowest educated categories would only be reduced by half (to a 6
   percentage point difference from 14 percentage points).
   Conclusion: We predict that almost half of Australian adults with low
   educational status will be obese by 2025. Current trends in obesity have
   the potential to drive an increase in the absolute difference in obesity
   prevalence between educational categories in future years.
   Implications: Unless obesity prevention and management strategies focus
   specifically on narrowing social inequalities in obesity, inequalities
   in health are likely to widen.}","{10.1111/j.1753-6405.2012.00885.x}","{1326-0200}","{ISI:000312273700022}","{Peeters, Anna/B-3663-2013

   also to an inadequate organization of public transport services that
   still represent a valid alternative to the car use only in sporadic
   cases. Recently the research community, local public administrations,

   consumption, pollution levels, congestion levels and road traffic.
   However, in order to make more effective all initiatives to promote

   presents a Decision Support System that relies on a logical network
   architecture characterized by the communication paradigm REST and
   powered by the use, on Client side, of smartphones that today have an
   enormous social relevance. Key goals of a REST-based platform include
   scalability of components interactions, generality of interfaces,
   independent deployment of components and intermediary components to
   enforce security and reduce latency.
   Through the elaboration of a large amount of transportation systems and
   land use data (Server side) and an user-friendly interface on the client
   it is possible to simultaneously register users' behavior on each trip
   they made (GPS sensors on smartphones allow the storage of the origin,
   the destination, the temporal window, the used mode of transport, the
   routes of the trips on the Server) and propose to users travel
   strategies alternative to car use.
   The Decision Support System is based on a Service Oriented Architecture

   attention. In the present study, uncoated and dextran-coated USPIO were
   investigated by analyzing both rat urine and plasma metabonomes using
   high-resolution NMR-based metabonomic analysis in combination with
   multivariate statistical analysis. The wealth of information gathered on
   the metabolic profiles from rat urine and plasma has revealed subtle
   metabolic changes in response to USPIO administration. The metabolic
   changes include the elevation of urinary alpha-hydroxy-n-valerate, o-
   and p-HPA, PAG, nicotinate and hippurate accompanied by decreases in the
   levels of urinary alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, citrate,
   N-methylnicotinamide, NAG, DMA, allantoin and acetate following USPIO

   included a gradual increase in plasma glucose, N-acetyl glycoprotein,
   saturated fatty acid, citrate, succinate, acetate, GPC, ketone bodies
   (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone and acetoacetate) and individual amino
   acids, such as phenylalanine, lysine, isoleucine, glycine, glutamine and
   glutamate and a gradual decrease of myo-inositol, unsaturated fatty acid
   and triacylglycerol. Hence USPIO administration effects are reflected in
   changes in a number of metabolic pathways including energy, lipid,
   glucose and amino acid metabolism. The size- and surface
   chemistry-dependent metabolic responses and possible toxicity were
   observed using NMR analysis of biofluids. These changes may be
   attributed to the disturbances of hepatic, renal and cardiac functions

   derived from metabonomic analysis and serum biochemistry analysis.
   Metabonomic strategy offers a promising approach for the detection of

   sexes. Twelve 24-hour recalls applied monthly during the year between
   the two administrations of the DH were used as a reference method.
   Results. Mean values of daily intake between the two methods were very

   arachidonyl-2'chloroethylamide/N-(2chloroethyl)-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetr

   not localized onto histaminergic cells. The modulatory effect of
   cannabimimetic compounds on histamine release apparently did not involve
   inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission,
   which provides the main inhibitory input to the histaminergic neurons in
   the hypothalamus, as local infusions of ACEA did not modify GABA release

   account rising cancer incidence now that people live longer because of
   declines in mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cancer
   mortality rates in the population do not accomplish this objective. We
   sought a measure that would reveal the effects of changing mortality
   rates from other diseases.
   Methods We obtained annual breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer
   mortality rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   registries; we obtained noncancer mortality rates from national death
   certificates, 1975 to 2005. We used life-table methods to calculate the
   burden of cancer mortality as the average person-years of life lost
   (PYLL) as a result of cancer (cancer-specific PYLL) and quantify
   individualand perhaps offsettingcontributions of the two factors that
   affect cancer-specific PYLL: mortality rates as a result of cancer and
   other-cause mortality.
   Results Falling cancer mortality rates reduced the burden of mortality
   from leading cancers, but increasing cancer incidence as a result of
   decreasing other-cause mortality rates partially offset this progress.
   Between 1985 and 1989 and between 2000 and 2004, the burden of lung
   cancer in males declined by 0.1 year of life lost. This decline reflects
   the sum of two effects: decreasing lung cancer mortality rates that
   reduced the average burden of lung cancer mortality by 0.33 years of
   life lost and declining other-cause mortality rates that raised it by
   0.23 years. Other common cancers showed similar patterns.

   psychiatric disorders, but the relationships between sleep and
   psychiatric disorders is complex. Sleep dysregulation is almost
   universal in psychiatric illness, whether in the form of insomnia (more
   common), hypersomnia, or disturbed circadian patterning of sleep-wake.
   Sleep disturbance and psychiatric disorders may both reflect underlying
   abnormalities in the central nervous system, and sleep symptoms are a
   component of many psychiatric diagnoses. Sleep disorders may contribute
   to or result from psychiatric disorders but may also result from
   medication treatment.
   Scientific interest in the relationship between sleep and psychiatric
   illness spans more than 30 years. Benca Obermeyer, Thisted, and Gillin
   (1992) ground-breaking historical meta-analysis of 177 studies
   representing 7,151 participants demonstrated the virtually universal
   nature of sleep disturbance and its association with psychiatric
   disorders. The objective findings revealed widespread reductions in
   sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and non-REM sleep. Although no
   single sleep alteration is specific for any particular psychiatric
   disorder, the patterns of sleep were most disturbed among patients with
   mood disorders. The investigators did not address the corollary of the
   lived experience associated with these objective changes in sleep
   architecture. However, Benca (2008) acknowledges that poor sleep
   efficiency and reduced sleep time result in sleep deprivation, namely
   daytime sleepiness, reduced energy, and possible cognitive cloudiness.
   These findings broadened the scientific perspective on sleep as a
   critical component in conceptualizing psychiatric disease, and interest
   in this area of research and practice remains strong (Krahn, 2005;
   Stores, 2007). For example, in a recent critical review on sleep and
   psychiatric disorders, Sateia (2009) documents high rates of comorbidity
   between sleep (especially insomnia) and various psychiatric disorders,
   especially mood, and anxiety disorders.
   Untreated sleep-related symptoms increase morbidity, decrease quality of
   life, and are associated with, impressive costs to the health care
   system. While there are no economic data on the overall impact of
   insomnia in the United States alone, Canadian data may provide a close
   approximation. Daley, Morin, LeBlanc, Gregoire, and Savard (2009)
   estimated the total annual cost of insomnia in the province of Quebec to
   be 6.5 billion Canadian dollars, which represents approximately 1\% of
   the province's \$228.5 billion in gross domestic product for 2002. In
   2008 in the United States alone, 56,287,000 prescriptions were dispensed
   for sleep medications, a 7\% rise since 2007. The implications of these
   data are compelling for contemporary nursing practice across all
   specialty areas of practice. Because nurses frequently care for patients
   who have insomnia, the specific approach to treatment has a powerful
   economic impact. Implementation of effective treatment strategies
   requires a detailed understanding of insomnia and the rationale behind
   effective treatment, as well as the impact of the 24-hour day. de Niet,
   Tiemens, Lendemeijer, and Hutschemaekers (2008), a group of nurse
   researchers, acknowledge that sleep disturbances are often misconstrued
   by providers as a night time concern and erroneously compartmentalize
   sleep to the darker hours of the 24-hour day. Such a myopic perspective
   will perpetuate inadequate assessment of and intervention for insomnia,
   contributing to the economic burden associated with the condition.
   This chapter will familiarize the reader with interactions between sleep
   and sleep disorders and psychiatric disorders. Implications for nurses
   who work with patients who have psychiatric disorders are discussed.
   Given the high prevalence of sleep disorders, their associations with
   medical, as well as psychiatric disorders, and their presence in
   patients who present for care across a wide range of clinical,
   community-based and hospital settings, the implications are broad.
   Patients with psychiatric disorders are treated across many practice
   settings. Therefore, the content of this chapter holds relevance for all
   nurses.
   The discussion addresses some of the most clinically salient and
   well-documented linkages between sleep and psychiatric illness and
   includes common mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia,
   alcoholism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The
   discussion of each diagnostic category addresses pharmacologic and
   behavioral interventions related to treatment of the particular disorder
   as it relates to sleep. Although this chapter focuses primarily on care
   of adults, childhood issues are addressed in the content related to
   ADHD. To clarify the discussion, important information is provided in a
   series of tables throughout the chapter: information on the diagnostic
   features of the disorders; changes seen in the polysomnographic changes

   METHODS: Using population projections from the U. S. Census Bureau and
   incidence and mortality rates from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
   Results surveys, we estimated the annual number of new gynecologic
   cancer cases through 2050; the effects of human papillomavirus (HPV)
   vaccination was included in cervical cancer estimates. The number of
   practicing gynecologic oncologists was projected through 2050 using data
   from the 2005 Society of Gynecologic Oncologists Practice Survey,
   current Society of Gynecologic Oncologists membership information,

   RESULTS: At constant training rates, the annual number of new cancer
   cases per practicing gynecologic oncologist will rise from 112 in 2010

   whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have experienced the
   same improvements in survival. The purpose of this study was to
   determine the mortality trends among RA patients compared with those in
   the general population.
   Methods. A population-based incidence cohort of RA patients was
   assembled, comprising all residents of Rochester, Minnesota ages a:18
   years in whom RA was first diagnosed (according to the American College
   of Rheumatology {[}formerly, the American Rheumatism Association] 1987
   criteria) between 1955 and 1995 and all residents of Olmsted County,
   Minnesota in whom RA was, first diagnosed between 1995 and 2000. The
   patients were followed up longitudinally through their complete
   (inpatient and outpatient) medical records until death or January 1,
   2007. Expected mortality was estimated from the National Center for
   Health Statistics life tables on the white population in Minnesota,
   using person-year methods. Poisson regression was used to model the
   observed mortality rates, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration.
   Results. A cohort of 822 RA patients (72\% women, mean age at RA
   incidence 58 years) was followed up for a median of 11.7 years, during
   which 445 of the RA patients died. Between 1965 and 2005, the mortality
   rates across the calendar years for female and male RA patients were
   relatively constant at 2.4 and 2.5 per 100 person-years, respectively.
   In contrast, the expected mortality rate in the Minnesota white
   population decreased substantially over the same time period in both
   sexes. Mortality in the female general population declined from 1.0 per
   100 person-years in 1965 to 0.2 per 100 person-years in 2000. Mortality
   in the male general population decreased from 1.2 per 100 person-years

   recent years, resulting in a widening of the mortality gap.
   Conclusion. Our findings show that RA patients have not experienced
   improvements in survival over the past 4 decades, despite dramatic
   improvements in the overall rates of mortality in the general US
   population. Further research into the causes of the widening gap in
   mortality between RA patients and the general population, and the

   Mycosis fungoides is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma,
   a malignant, chronic disease initially affecting the skin. Several
   therapies are available, which may induce clinical remission for a time.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of interventions for mycosis fungoides in all
   stages of the disease.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases up to January 2011: the Cochrane
   Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library,
   MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), and LILACS (from 1982). We also
   checked reference lists of included studies for further references to
   relevant RCTs. We searched online trials registries for further
   references to unpublished trials and undertook a separate search for
   adverse effects of interventions for mycosis fungoides in non-RCTs in
   MEDLINE in May 2011.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for mycosis
   fungoides in people with any stage of the disease. At least 90\% of
   participants in the trials must have been diagnosed with mycosis
   fungoides (Alibert-Bazin-type).
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors independently assessed eligibility and methodological
   quality for each study and carried out data extraction. We resolved any
   disagreement by discussion. Primary outcomes were the impact on quality
   of life and the safety of interventions. When available, we reported on
   our secondary outcomes, which were the improvement or clearance of skin
   lesions, disease-free intervals, survival rates, relapse rates, and rare
   adverse effects. When possible, we combined homogeneous studies for
   meta-analysis. We used The Cochrane Collaboration's `Risk of bias' tool
   to assess the internal validity of all included studies in six different
   domains.
   Main results
   The review included 14 RCTs involving 675 participants, covering a wide
   range of interventions. Eleven of the included trials assessed
   participants in clinical stages IA to IIB only (please see Table 1 for
   definitions of these stages). Internal validity was considerably low in
   studies with a high or unclear risk of bias. The main reasons for this
   were low methodological quality or missing data, even after we contacted
   the study authors, and a mean dropout rate of 26\% (0\% to 72\%). Study
   size was generally small with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 103
   participants. Only one study provided a long enough follow-up for
   reliable survival analysis.
   Included studies assessed topical treatments, such as imiquimod,
   peldesine, hypericin, nitrogen mustard, as well as intralesional
   injections of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). The light therapies
   investigated included psoralen plus ultraviolet Alight (PUVA),
   extracorporeal photopheresis (photochemotherapy), and visible light.
   Oral treatments included acitretin, bexarotene, and methotrexate.
   Treatment with parenteral systemic agents consisted of denileukin
   diftitox; a combination of chemotherapy and electron beam radiation; and
   intramuscular injections of active transfer factor. Nine studies
   evaluated therapies by using an active comparator; five were
   placebo-controlled RCTs.
   Twelve studies reported on common adverse effects, while only two
   assessed quality of life. None of these studies compared the
   health-related quality of life of participants undergoing different
   treatments. Most of the reported adverse effects were attributed to the
   interventions. Systemic treatments, and here in particular a combined
   therapeutic regimen of chemotherapy and electron beam, bexarotene, or
   denileukin diftitox, showed more adverse effects than topical or
   skin-directed treatments.
   In the included studies, clearance rates ranged from 0\% to 83\%, and
   improvement ranged from 0\% to 88\%. The meta-analysis combining the
   results of 2 trials comparing the effect of IFN-alpha and PUVA versus
   PUVA alone showed no significant difference in the relative risk of
   clearance: 1.07 (95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.31). None of the
   included studies demonstrated a significant increase in disease-free
   intervals, relapse, or overall survival.
   Authors' conclusions
   This review identified trial evidence for a range of different topical
   and systemic interventions for mycosis fungoides. Because of substantial
   heterogeneity in design, small sample sizes, and low methodological
   quality, the comparative safety and efficacy of these interventions
   cannot be established on the basis of the included RCTs. Taking into
   account the possible serious adverse effects and the limited
   availability of efficacy data, topical and skin-directed treatments are
   recommended first, especially in the early stages of disease. More
   aggressive therapeutic regimens may show improvement or clearance of
   lesions, but they also result in more adverse effects; therefore, they
   are to be considered with caution. Larger studies with comparable,
   clearly-defined end points for all stages of mycosis fungoides, and a
   focus on safety, quality of life, and duration of remission as part of
   the outcome measures, are necessary.}","{10.1002/14651858.CD008946.pub2}","{1469-493X}","{ISI:000308827800033}",NA,NA,"{CD008946}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   adjuvant systemic therapy for resected, high risk melanoma in the United
   States (Fecher and Flaherty, in Natl Compr Cancer Netw 7:295-304, 2009).
   Recently, two important meta-analyses of randomized trials (Wheatley et
   al., in J Clin Oncol, 2007; Mocellin et al. in J Natl Cancer Inst, 2010)
   investigating IFN alpha-2b versus observation in high risk melanoma
   patients, showed that adjuvant IFN alpha-2b has an impact both on
   relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) independently by
   dosage, duration and route compared with observation in high risk
   melanoma patients. Despite of an absolute benefits of 3 \% (Wheatley et
   al., in J Clin Oncol, 2007), this treatment is associated with
   significant toxicity, which impacts on patient quality of life. A better
   understanding of the mechanism of action may help to potentiate the
   clinical efficacy and reduce the toxicity of IFN alpha-2b/Peg-IFN
   alpha-2b. Numerous studies suggest that interferon's mechanism of action
   in melanoma is primarily immunomodulatory (Table 1) (de La Salmoniere,
   in Clin Cancer Res 6:4713-4718, 2000; Stuckert, in J Clin Oncol 25:8506,
   2007; Gogas et al., in N Engl J Med 354:709-718, 2006; Moschos et al.,
   in J Clin Oncol 24:3164-3171, 2006; Ascierto and Kirkwood, in J Transl
   Med 6:62, 2008) Recent efforts to elucidate the mechanism of action for
   interferon have focused upon signal transducers and activators of
   transcription (STAT) (Simons et al., in J Transl Med 9:52, 2011)
   signaling and immunoregulatory responses mediated by regulatory T cells
   (Tregs) (Wang et al., in Clin Cancer Res 13:1523-1531, 2007; Clin Cancer
   Res 14:8314-8320, 2008). Tregs are a suppressive CD4+ T cell population
   that is present, along with primed effector T cells, in tumor and
   tumor-draining lymph nodes (Hiura et al. in J Immunol 175:5058-5066,
   2005). Tregs express high levels of surface antigens such as CD25,
   cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and
   glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) (Takahashi
   et al., in J Exp Med 192:303-310, 2000; Shimizu et al., in Nat Immunol
   3:135-142, 2002). Moreover, Tregs express a characteristic nuclear
   transcription regulator, forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) (Hori et al., in
   Science 299:1057-1061, 2003; Gabriel and Lattime, in Clin Cancer Res
   13:785-788, 2007). The presence of Tregs in tumor-draining lymph nodes
   and tumors provides a potential inhibitory population that may block or
   balance effector cell function. Thus, depletion of Tregs or blockade of
   Treg function using targeted antibodies or other strategies might be
   able to remove Treg suppression and enhance antitumor immunity (Viguier
   et al., in J Immunol 173:1444-1453, 2004). We conducted an observational
   study to examine whether the induction phase of the FDA-approved HDI
   regimen administered iv in patients with stage 3-4 melanoma (20 MU/m(2)
   intravenously (IV) five times per week for 4 weeks) reduced the number
   of Treg cells in the peripheral blood.}","{10.1007/s10585-012-9504-2}","{0262-0898}","{ISI:000310464700018}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   red blood cell transfusion of any quantity (OR 6.3 {[}3.5-11.2], P <

   model were dependent functional status (adjusted OR 2.1 {[}1.1-4.3], P =
   .049) and intraoperative transfusion (adjusted OR 4.5 {[}2.3-8.9], P =
   .0002). Postoperative bleeding complications within 72 hours
   independently predicted early amputation (adjusted OR 25.5 {[}1.7-393],
   P = .02). Unadjusted patient survival was 92.6\% at one year and 86.1\%
   at two years. Limb salvage in surviving patients was 99.0\% at 30 days,
   97.6\% at one year, and 96.2\% at two years. Dependent preoperative
   functional status was the only factor predictive of worse two-year limb
   salvage (adjusted OR 4.6 {[}1.9-10.9], P = .001), but remained high at

   Conclusions: Surgical intervention for PAA is associated with low
   operative mortality and offers excellent two-year limb salvage, even in
   high-risk patients. Patients' preoperative functional status and

   only one type of renewable energy system, since renewable energy
   resources depend on climate and weather conditions. Two or more
   renewable energy systems can be integrated into a hybrid system to
   overcome this problem so that when one resource is not available, the

   horses. A review}","{ARCHIVES OF ANIMAL NUTRITION-ARCHIV FUR TIERERNAHRUNG}","{1999}","{52}","{2}","{115-138}",NA,"{L-carnitine, a betaine derivative of beta-hydroxybutyrate, is found in
   virtually all cells of higher animals and also in some microorganisms
   and plants. In animals it is synthesized almost exclusively in the
   liver. Two essential amino acids, i.e., lysine and methionine serve as
   primary substrates for its biosynthesis. Also required for its synthesis
   are sufficient amounts of vitamin B-6, nicotinic acids, vitamin C and
   folate. The first discovered ergogenic function of L-carnitine is the
   transfer of activated long-chain fatty acids across the inner
   mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix. For this transfer
   acyl-CoA esters are transesterified to form acylcarnitine esters. Thus,
   in carnitine deficiency fat oxidation and energy production from fatty
   acids are markedly impaired. Skeletal muscles constitute the main
   reservoir of carnitine in the body and have a carnitine concentration at
   least 200 times higher than blood plasma. Uptake of carnitine by
   skeletal muscles takes place by an active transport mechanism which
   transports L-carnitine into muscles probably in the form of an exchange
   process with gamma-butyrobetain.
   In young animals including foals, the capacity for biosynthesis of
   carnitine is not yet fully developed and apparently cannot meet the
   requirements of sucking animals. Sucking animals depend therefore on an
   extra supply of carnitine which is usually provided with milk.
   Additionally, young animals including foals possess a lower
   concentration of carnitine in blood plasma than adult animals. Besides
   its role as carrier of activated acyl groups, L-carnitine functions as a
   buffer for acetyl groups which may be present in excess in different
   tissues during ketosis and hypoxic muscular activity.
   Other functions of L-carnitine are protection of membrane structures.
   stabilizing of a physiologic CoA-SH/acetyl-CoA ratio and reduction of
   lactate production. Animal's derived feeds are rich in L-carnitine
   whereas plants contain usually very little or no carnitine. Carnitine is
   absorbed from the small intestine by active and passive transport
   mechanisms. From the increase in renal excretion of L-carnitine after
   oral supplementations of 10 g/d to horses it has been concluded that the
   efficiency of absorption of L-carnitine is rather low (about 5 to 10\%
   of the supplied dose). A further decrease in fractional carnitine
   absorption was observed when the oral dose of carnitine was increased.
   L-carnitine is virtually not degraded in the body and renal excretion of
   carnitine is comparatively small under normal conditions. The
   concentration of L-carnitine in blood plasma of horses varies markedly
   between animals and between different days. In addition, circadian
   changes in carnitine concentration in plasma have been reported. Peak
   concentrations were found during late afternoon, being up to 30\% higher
   than those in the morning.
   In breeding mares the carnitine concentration in blood plasma declines
   with onset of lactation. In resting skeletal muscles about 90\% of the
   total carnitine content is present as free carnitine with the remaining
   part being available as carnitine esters. With increasing exercise
   intensity a continuing greater proportion of free carnitine (up to 80\%)
   is converted into carnitine esters, mainly into acetylcarnitine. This
   shift from free to acetylcarnitine is readily reversed within about 30
   min after termination of exercise. It appears that acute exercise does
   not have a marked effect on the content of total carnitine in skeletal
   muscle whereas training seems to elevate its total concentration in the
   middle gluteal muscle of 3 to 6 year old horses and to reduce variation
   of its concentration compared to age-matched untrained horses.
   Oral supplementations of 5 to 50 g of L-carnitine per day to horses
   elevated the carnitine concentration in blood plasma to about twice its
   basal concentration. No clear relationship existed, however, between the
   orally administered dose of carnitine and the increase of L-carnitine
   concentration in blood plasma.
   Oral supplementations of carnitine also tended to elevate the carnitine
   concentration in milk of mares and in blood plasma of sucking foals.
   Long-term oral administration of L-carnitine (e.g., for months) also
   appeared to increase the carnitine concentration in skeletal muscles.
   But information is lacking as to whether such administrations also
   affect physical performance of the exercising muscle. Oral
   supplementation of carnitine to horses reduced the resting values of
   lactate in plasma and appeared to reduce the concentration of
   non-esterified fatty acids in plasma during exercise. These effects of
   carnitine appeared also to be influenced by the amount and type of fat
   which is contained in the feed. Oral supplementations of carnitine to
   stallions mag. improve impaired motility of sperm, improvements of feed
   conversion and weight gain in growing horses due to oral
   supplementations of carnitine have been reported. But these preliminary
   findings probably require further confirmation.
   Further studies are also required to better evaluate possible effects of
   oral supplementations of carnitine on energy metabolism, cardiac
   functions and physical performance in horses at rest and during
   exercise, and to perhaps better characterize the conditions under which
   carnitine may be beneficial to horses.}",NA,"{0003-942X}","{ISI:000079973500002}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   energy resources, for example, approximately 6000 MW of wind energy
   resources. Nevertheless, solar energy is not sufficiently developed in
   Mexico. In this work, the global solar resources in Mexican states along
   the Gulf of Mexico were assessed. The data used in the analysis were
   obtained from the Automatic Meteorological Stations (AMEs) of the
   National Meteorological Service of Mexico (NMS) every 10 min over a
   period of 10 years, as well as from the Surface Meteorology and Solar

   System (GIS), one per month, and annually averaged global solar
   resources were used to determine the areas and the periods of the year

   results obtained in this study, the highest amount of solar energy,
   i.e., greater than 622 kWh/m(2)/day, was registered on July in the state

   significant potential for complementing energetic requirements in
   Mexican states along the Gulf of Mexico. It is recommended that the

   determine the amount of primary energy consumed as a function of its

   the changes that have occurred in U. S. energy use since the 1970s and
   suggests how renewable energy could provide a large fraction of the
   energy used for direct use at low end-use temperatures that is currently
   mostly supplied by high grade fossil fuels. For example, most of the
   low-temperature energy used for water and space heating is provided by
   combusting natural gas and oil at very high temperatures. This process
   downgrades the thermodynamic potential of the fossil fuels for
   generating power resulting in large reduction in the exergy or
   availability of the combustion products. By focusing attention on the
   thermodynamic losses inherent to our current energy system, we suggest a
   paradigm shift in the way we view and use energy by strategically
   matching the source providing the energy to the end-use temperature of
   the application. Thermal energy demands below 260 degrees C could be
   supplied more sustainably without large exergetic losses by geothermal
   or solar thermal energy resources, as well as by waste heat from fuel
   combustion processes. In addition, direct thermal use of available
   low-temperature thermal energy results in higher overall efficiencies
   compared to electricity generation by avoiding the substantial 2nd Law
   losses incurred in converting thermal energy to electricity. Using the
   U.S. Energy Information Administration database as a primary source of
   information, we found that the total thermal demand in the temperature
   range from 0 to 260 degrees C in 2008 was 33.5 EJ (31.7 quads), which is

   One model uses an ANN (artificial neural network) technique, and the
   other model uses a MLR (multiple linear regression) technique. Various
   independent variables (GDP, price of energy carriers) are tested. The
   future industrial energy demand can then be forecasted based on a

   The ANN model anticipates a 16\% increase in energy demand from 2012 by
   2030. In this forecast, the model assumes that the effective independent
   parameters remain constant during this period and only GDP grows with a

   indication of the need for development of new and low-cost energy

   Gestational weight gain is positively associated with fetal growth, and
   observational studies of food supplementation in pregnancy have reported

   Objectives
   To assess the effects of advice during pregnancy to increase energy and
   protein intake, or of actual energy and protein supplementation, on
   energy and protein intakes, and the effect on maternal and infant health
   outcomes.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials
   Register (22 July 2011) and contacted researchers in the field. We
   updated the search on 12 July 2012 and added the results to the awaiting
   classification section of the review.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials of dietary advice to increase energy and
   protein intake, or of actual energy and protein supplementation, during
   pregnancy.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and
   assessed risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data
   and checked for accuracy. Extracted data were supplemented by additional
   information from the trialists we contacted.
   Main results
   We examined 110 reports corresponding to 46 trials. Of these trials, 15
   were included, 30 were excluded, and one is ongoing. Overall, 15 trials
   involving 7410 women were included.
   Nutritional advice (four trials, 790 women)
   Women given nutritional advice had a lower relative risk of having a
   preterm birth (two trials, 449 women) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95\% CI
   0.21 to 0.98), head circumference at birth was increased in one trial
   (389 women) (mean difference (MD) 0.99 cm, 95\% CI 0.43 to 1.55) and
   protein intake increased (three trials, 632 women) (protein intake: MD
   +6.99 g/day, 95\% CI 3.02 to 10.97). No significant differences were
   observed on any other outcomes.
   Balanced energy and protein supplementation (11 trials, 5385 women)
   Risk of stillbirth was significantly reduced for women given balanced
   energy and protein supplementation (RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.40 to 0.98, five
   trials, 3408 women), mean birthweight was significantly increased
   (random-effects MD +40.96 g, 95\% CI 4.66 to 77.26, Tau(2) = 1744, I-2 =
   44\%, 11 trials, 5385 women). There was also a significant reduction in
   the risk of small-for-gestational age (RR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.69 to 0.90,
   I-2 = 16\%, seven trials, 4408 women). No significant effect was
   detected for preterm birth or neonatal death.
   High-protein supplementation (one trial, 1051 women)
   High-protein supplementation (one trial, 505 women), was associated with
   a significantly increased risk of small-for-gestational age babies (RR
   1.58, 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.41).
   Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women)
   Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women) had no
   significant effect on birthweight and weekly gestational weight gain.
   Authors' conclusions
   This review provides encouraging evidence that antenatal nutritional
   advice with the aim of increasing energy and protein intake in the
   general obstetric population appears to be effective in reducing the
   risk of preterm birth, increasing head circumference at birth and
   increasing protein intake, there was no evidence of benefit or adverse
   effect for any other outcome reported.
   Balanced energy and protein supplementation seems to improve fetal
   growth, and may reduce the risk of stillbirth and infants born
   small-for-gestational age. High-protein supplementation does not seem to
   be beneficial and may be harmful to the fetus. Balanced-protein
   supplementation alone had no significant effects on perinatal outcomes.
   The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, the risk
   of bias was either unclear or high for at least one category examined in
   several of the included trials and the quality of the evidence was low
   for several important outcomes. Also the anthropometric characteristics
   of the general obstetric population is changing, therefore, those
   developing interventions aimed at altering energy and protein intake
   should ensure that only those women likely to benefit are included.
   Large, well designed randomised trials are needed to assess the effects
   of increasing energy and protein intake during pregnancy in women whose
   intake is below recommended levels.}","{10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub2}","{1469-493X}","{ISI:000308828600016}",NA,NA,"{CD000032}","{1361-6137}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   recruited from the Halifax university community. Participants provided
   information about their lifetime ED and other substance use, in addition
   to detailing instances of their ED and alcohol use during the previous
   week using a timeline follow-back interview. Results. Seventy-six per
   cent of participants reported ever deliberately mixing alcohol with EDs
   and 19\% reported doing so during the previous week. Relative to alcohol
   drinking sessions in which EDs were not used, participants reported
   drinking significantly more alcohol when it was co-administered with
   EDs. Discussion and Conclusions. Alcohol and ED co-administration is
   relatively common among ED users and seems to be associated with
   increased alcohol ingestion. It is recommended that this matter receive
   more clinical and research attention. {[}Price SR, Hilchey CA, Darredeau

   increased calorie intake alone though no information on its effect on
   total energy expenditure is available in humans. We therefore assessed
   whether weight gain associated with glucocorticoids is due to a
   reduction in energy expenditure.
   DESIGN We performed an open study with 1 mg of betamethasone given
   orally twice a day for 21 days.
   SUBJECTS Seven healthy female volunteers, age range 26-55 years, body
   mass index 19 to 40, mean 27 kg/m(2).
   MEASUREMENTS Total free living energy expenditure was measured by the
   doubly labelled water method (D-2 O-18), resting metabolic rate by
   ventilated hood indirect calorimetry and fat free mass from the dilution
   volume of oxygen-18 labelled water. Body composition and components of
   energy expenditure were assessed before and during the final 14 days of
   betamethasone administration.
   RESULTS Weight increased by a mean of 1.2 kg (P < 0.05) because of a
   significant rise in fat mass (1.5 kg) with no change in fat free mass.
   Resting metabolic rate remained unaltered on betamethasone but total
   energy expenditure increased in all subjects with a significant mean
   rise of 26\% from 11.7 to 14.7 MJ/24 h (P < 0.05). The energy component
   of physical activity with thermogenesis increased on average 52\% (from
   5.8 to 8.9 MJ/24 h; P < 0.05). The rise in energy expenditure was still
   apparent after correction for the increase in body weight. Fasting
   respiratory quotient (RQ) increased from 0.81 to 0.86 with no change in
   fasting blood glucose. Betamethasone did not result in an energy sparing
   effect on the two components of energy expenditure studied.
   CONCLUSIONS Body weight increased on betamethasone entirely due to an
   increase in fat mass. This occurred despite a rise in total energy
   expenditure which involved specifically that component accounted for by
   physical activity plus thermogenesis. The most likely explanation is
   that betamethasone increased dietary energy intake significantly in
   excess of expenditure. We estimate that an average extra energy intake
   of 2.8 MJ/day would have had to be consumed for this rise in fat mass to
   occur even before taking into account the energy intake cost of the rise
   in expenditure.}","{10.1111/j.1365-2265.1994.tb03007.x}","{0300-0664}","{ISI:A1994NK15700002}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   with liver cirrhosis are in protein and energy balance at their
   spontaneous dietary intake and that an improvement in nutritional status
   cannot be anticipated at this intake (Nielsen et al. 1993). In the
   present study we examined to what extent oral intake could be increased
   by nutritional support, and to what extent dietary protein would be
   retained with increased intake. The techniques used for balance studies
   were also validated since this information is not available for patients
   with liver cirrhosis. Fifteen malnourished patients with alcoholic liver
   cirrhosis were given increasing amounts of a balanced ordinary diet for
   38 (SE 3) d. Intakes of protein and energy were recorded by weighing
   servings and leftovers on food trays. Protein intake was calculated from
   food tables, Total N disposal was calculated after measurement of
   urinary N excretion, and protein balance was calculated from the N
   balance. A validation study of protein balance in a subgroup of patients
   (analysis of N in food by the duplicate portion technique, correction
   for incomplete recovery of urine by measurement of urinary
   para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) after administration of PAPA tablets, and
   measurement of faecal N) did not change protein balance values. Protein
   intake increased from 1.0 (SE 0.1) g/kg per d to 1.8 (SE 0.1) g/kg per
   d. With increasing protein intake, 84 (SE 8)\% of the increase in intake
   was retained. The rate of protein retention was not saturated at the
   intakes obtained in this study. Protein intolerance was only encountered
   in one patient. Available evidence indicates that the requirement for
   achieving N balance is increased in these patients but protein retention
   is highly efficient with increased intake, Protein retention is
   dependent on energy balance. Energy intake was calculated from food
   tables and total energy expenditure was calculated by the factorial
   method. A validation study was performed in a subgroup of patients. The
   energy contents of food sampled by the duplicate portion technique, and
   of urine and faeces were measured by bomb calorimetry, Resting energy
   expenditure (REE) was measured by indirect calorimetry before and at the
   end of the study, and O-2 uptake during bicycle exercise was measured
   before and at the end of the study. The measured intake of metabolizable
   energy was on average 13\% lower than the value given in food tables.
   Calculated energy expenditure was not changed by the validation study.
   Mean energy intake was 163 (SE 10) kJ/kg per d and mean energy
   expenditure was 134 (SE 5) kJ/kg per d (P = 0.007), indicating that the
   protein retention described occurred at a positive energy balance, It is
   concluded that a substantial retention of dietary protein can be
   obtained by oral nutrition support over a prolonged period of time in

   2,359,000-3,271,000 Mm(3) in 2035 under the Reference Case of the Energy

   increase by 26\% due to increased biofuel production, going from
   16,700-46,400 Mm(3) consumption in 2010 to 21,000-58,400 Mm(3)
   consumption in 2035. Regionally, water use in the Southwest and
   Southeast may increase, with anticipated decreases in water use in some
   areas of the Midwest and Northeast. Policies that promote energy
   efficiency or conservation in the electric sector would reduce water
   withdrawn/manipulated by 27-36 m(3)GJ(-1) (0.1-0.5 m(3)GJ(-1)
   consumption), while such policies in the liquid fuel sector would reduce
   withdrawal/manipulation by 0.4-0.7 m(3)GJ(-1) (0.2-0.3 m(3) GJ(-1)
   consumption). The greatest energy sector withdrawal/manipulation are for
   hydropower and thermoelectric cooling, although potential new EPA rules
   that would require recirculating cooling for thermoelectric plants would
   reduce withdrawal/manipulation by 441,000 Mm(3) (20,300 Mm(3)
   consumption). The greatest consumptive energy sector use is evaporation
   from hydroelectric reservoirs, followed by irrigation water for biofuel
   feedstocks and water used for electricity generation from coal.
   Historical water use by the energy sector is related to patterns of fish
   species endangerment, where water resource regions with a greater
   fraction of available surface water withdrawn by hydropower or consumed
   by the energy sector correlated with higher probabilities of
   imperilment. Since future increases in energy-sector surface water use

   The standard search strategy of the Neonatal Review Group as outlined in
   The Cochrane Library was used. Relevant randomised controlled trials
   were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
   Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2012 Issue 9), MEDLINE, EMBASE and
   CINAHL from their earliest dates to September 2012. The trial registry
   portal of the World Health Organization's International Cilinical Trial
   Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (US National Institute of
   Health) was searched to identify ongoing and completed but unpublished
   studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials comparing early administration of amino
   acids with late administration in premature newborn infants were
   included. Early administration of amino acid solution was defined as the
   administration of amino acids in isolation or with total parenteral
   nutrition within the first 24 hours of birth; late initiation was
   defined as the administration of amino acids in isolation or with total
   parenteral nutrition after the first 24 hours of birth. The primary
   outcome measures were growth, neurodevelopmental outcome and mortality
   at 28 days. The secondary outcomes were biochemical abnormalities,
   sepsis and mortality.
   Data collection and analysis
   Both review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial
   quality and extracted data from the included studies. We contacted
   authors for further information. Fixed-effect analyses were performed.
   The treatment effect was expressed as mean difference for continuous
   variables and as risk difference and risk ratio for dichotomous
   variables. All results included 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Main results
   Seven randomised controlled trials were included in this review. One
   randomised controlled trial reported no difference in crown-heel length
   and occipitofrontal head circumference by day 10. Four trials that
   enrolled 93 premature infants showed positive nitrogen balance (The mean
   difference with 95\% CI was 250.42 (224.91 to 275.93 P value < 0.00001).
   Four trials showed a significant difference in the level of blood urea
   nitrogen (BUN) in the first 48 hours (P value < 0.00001). Early
   administration of amino acids did not result in metabolic acidosis in
   the first 24 hours.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is no available evidence of the benefits of early administration
   of amino acids on mortality, early and late growth and
   neuro-development. There is evidence from four randomised controlled
   trials included in this review that early administration of amino acids
   is associated with a positive nitrogen balance. The clinical relevance
   of this finding is not known. Acid-base status and ammonia levels were
   normal in the infants who received amino acids early. Given the small
   number of infants in the randomised controlled trials included in this
   review, the clinical heterogeneity among them, and the lack of data on
   important clinical outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to guide
   practice regarding the early versus late administration of amino acids
   to infants less than 37 weeks gestation.}","{10.1002/14651858.CD008771.pub2}","{1469-493X}","{ISI:000322568300025}",NA,NA,"{CD008771}","{1361-6137}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   body mass (LBM), decreased fat mass (FM) and increased energy
   expenditure (EE). GH therapy may therefore have potential benefits,
   especially in the elderly, who are known to have decreased function of
   the GH/IGF-I axis. Several studies have focused on effects of GH
   administration in the elderly in the last decade. However, very limited
   information is available regarding changes in body composition and EE
   upon GH discontinuation in the elderly. The present study therefore
   investigated the effects of 12 weeks of GH administration and subsequent
   discontinuation on body composition, resting oxygen uptake (VO2),
   resting heart rate (HR) and GH related serum markers in healthy elderly
   men.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS Sixteen healthy men {[}age 74 +/- 1 years (mean
   SEM), height 174.2 +/- 1.6 cm, body weight 80.7 +/- 2.6 kg, body fat
   27.5 +/- 1.1\%] completed the study protocol. Recombinant human GH (1.80
   +/- 0.24 IU/day) was administered for 12 weeks in a single-blinded,
   placebo-controlled design. Body composition (dual energy X-ray
   absorptiometry), resting VO2 (indirect calorimetry), resting HR
   (telemetry) and serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3 and acid labile subunit
   (ALS) were measured at baseline, after 12 weeks of GH administration
   and, additionally in the GH group, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 days after GH
   discontinuation.
   RESULTS Body weight was unchanged from baseline to 12 weeks in both
   groups. However, GH administration caused a decrease in FM (3.4 +/- 1.0
   kg, P < 0.012), paralleled by a similar increase in LBM (3.2 +/- 0.4 kg,
   P < 0.0002). Resting VO2 and resting HR increased by 31 +/- 3.6\% and
   7.3 +/- 1.9 per minute, respectively, in the GH-group, where significant
   increases in serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and ALS also were noted. None of the
   above parameters changed in the placebo group. Within 2-3 days after GH
   discontinuation, the GH related serum markers and resting HR returned to
   baseline levels, whereas resting VO2 remained elevated even 9 days after
   GH discontinuation. In addition, GH discontinuation caused a significant
   decrease in body weight (1.86 +/- 0.35 kg), derived exclusively from a
   decrease in LBM (1.63 +/- 0.43 kg), while the decreased FM was
   maintained (12 weeks: 17.93 +/- 1.65 kg, +9 days: 17.74 +/- 1.62 kg).
   CONCLUSIONS The increases in serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3, ALS and resting heart
   rate induced by 12 weeks of GH administration in elderly men returned to
   baseline levels within 2-3 days after GH discontinuation. However,
   resting VO2 remained elevated for a longer period. GH administration
   reduced fat mass but maintained body weight by increasing lean body
   mass. In contrast, 9 days of GH discontinuation reduced body weight
   exclusively by reducing lean body mass.}","{10.1046/j.1365-2265.2001.01344.x}","{0300-0664}","{ISI:000170179200011}","{Juul, Anders /F-5864-2013}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   improved intestinal morphology, indicated by higher villus height and
   villus height: crypt depth ratio, and lower crypt depth. Asn
   supplementation also increased the ratios of RNA: DNA and protein: DNA
   as well as disaccharidase activities in intestinal mucosa. In addition,
   Asn supplementation attenuated bacterial LPS-induced intestinal energy
   deficits, indicated by increased ATP and adenylate energy charge levels,
   and decreased AMP: ATP ratio. Moreover, Asn administration increased the
   activities of key enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle,

   alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Finally, Asn administration
   decreased the mRNA abundance of intestinal AMP-activated protein

   services, occupy the market and achieve the market value. The criterion
   to the success or failure of technology innovation is profit. The
   national and international practice of technology innovation shows that
   technology innovation could not be separated from the market. On the
   basis of the market's request, technology innovation puts forward the
   direction of innovation and then makes a tentative plan into a product
   and sells it in the market. The product will be improved after it is
   tested in the market. Then new direction of innovation will be put
   forward. That comes into being a circulation. In the process of
   enterprises' technology innovation, enterprises are the main body,
   customers are the guidance, the market is the mechanism, the government
   is the environment, and the institutes are the support. During the
   process of innovation, entrepreneurs are the soul. This could be a
   complete innovation system! To Chinese enterprises' technology
   innovation, under the circumstances of the variation of market request

   interoperability, free trade agreements among a set of neighbouring

   NPM has been called market-based public administration, managerialism,
   reinvention of government, and a post-bureaucratic model. Now, the
   concepts of governance and good governance by extension E-governance and
   E-government - are being increasingly used in development literature.
   E-government is an essential condition for global administration and

   efficiency programs funded by electric and gas utility customers in the
   USA, under three scenarios through 2025. Our analysis, which updates a
   previous LBNL study, relies on detailed bottom-up modeling of current
   state energy efficiency policies, regulatory decisions, and demand-side
   management and utility resource plans. The three scenarios are intended
   to represent a range of potential outcomes under the current policy
   environment (i.e., without considering possible major new policy
   developments).
   Key findings from the analysis are as follows:
   By 2025, spending on electric and gas efficiency programs (excluding
   load management programs) is projected to double from 2010 levels to
   \$9.5 billion in the medium case, compared to \$15.6 billion in the high
   case and \$6.5 billion in the low case.
   Compliance with statewide legislative or regulatory savings or spending
   targets is the primary driver for the increase in electric program
   spending through 2025, though a significant share of the increase is
   also driven by utility DSM planning activity and integrated resource
   planning.
   Our analysis suggests that electric efficiency program spending may
   approach a more even geographic distribution over time in terms of
   absolute dollars spent, with the Northeastern and Western states
   declining from over 70 \% of total USA spending in 2010 to slightly more
   than 50 \% in 2025, and the South and Midwest splitting the remainder
   roughly evenly.
   Under our medium case scenario, annual incremental savings from
   customer-funded electric energy efficiency programs increase from 18.4
   TWh in 2010 in the USA (which is about 0.5 \% of electric utility retail
   sales) to 28.8 TWh in 2025 (0.8 \% of retail sales).
   These savings would offset the majority of load growth in the Energy
   Information Administration's most recent reference case forecast, given
   specific assumptions about the extent to which future energy efficiency
   program savings are captured in that forecast.
   The pathway that customer-funded efficiency programs ultimately take
   will depend on a series of key challenges and uncertainties associated

   study, the effect of the beam energy (kVp) was examined using the
   CNR2/dose metric, where CNR is the contrast-to-noise ratio and dose

   using parameterized normalized glandular dose coefficients (DgN), which
   allowed the computation of the mean glandular dose for the modeled

   tissue-equivalent phantom (7.5 cm in thickness) was placed at the
   isocenter of the scanner, and an air gap of 34.5 cm was used in lieu of
   a grid. Dilute iodine-based contrast agent was introduced into the
   phantoms using plastic vials. Data were acquired from 40 to 90 kVp at 10
   kVp intervals. Due to the low mA available on the breast CT system, a
   large number of images (1000) were acquired in fluoroscopic mode, which
   allowed us to match the dose and noise properties for each kVp
   combinations by changing the number of images used for averaging.
   Preliminary results demonstrate that the best CNR2/dose is achieved with
   a 50 kVp low-energy image and a 90 kVp high-energy image. Consequently,
   radiation doses for contrast-enhanced mammography should be far lower
   than regular mammography. Since the spatial resolution requirements

   homeostatic central nervous system (CNS) regulation of body fat with the
   particular involvement of hypothalamic pathways. The peripheral
   adiposity signals insulin and leptin convey information on the amount of
   energy stored as body fat to the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,
   where anabolic/orexigenic and catabolic/anorexigenic pathways interact
   to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. One of the most
   prominent orexigenic messengers is neuropeptide Y (NPY), whereas
   melanocortins, including alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone
   (alpha-MSH), are essential for inducing anorexigenic effects. The
   melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4-R) plays the most important role in
   mediating catabolic effects of alpha-MSH. In this review, we present a
   series of own studies on NPY, insulin and MSH/ACTH(4-10), an MC4-R
   agonist. The studies were all based on the intranasal route of
   administration which enables a direct access of the peptides to
   hypothalamic functions. NPY acutely attenuated electrocortical signs of
   meal-related satiety. Prolonged intranasal administration of insulin as
   well as of MSH induced weight loss in healthy human subjects. However,
   overweight subjects did not lose body fat after MSH administration. The
   results corroborate in humans the significance of all three messengers
   for the central nervous regulation of adiposity and might contribute to
   the future development of medical strategies against body-weight-related
   disorders. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}","{10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.07.023}","{0031-9384}","{ISI:000224780600008}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   MethodsUsing a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 19
   participants completed 4 sessions where they received: (i) placebo, (ii)
   alcohol, (iii) AmED 500ml energy drink (ED), and (iii) AmED 750ml ED.
   Performance on measures of psychomotor function (Compensatory Tracking
   Task {[}CTT]), information processing (Digit Symbol Substitution Task
   {[}DSST]; Inspection Time Task {[}ITT]), and response inhibition (Brief
   Stop-Signal Task {[}Brief SST]) was assessed at similar to 0.05\%

   descending BrAC.
   ResultsThe ITT and Brief SST showed no differential effect of AmED
   versus alcohol (gs<0.30 and gs<0.36, respectively). Moderate magnitude
   improvements in alcohol-induced impairment of CTT and DSST performance
   were observed after AmED versus alcohol on the descending BrAC limb

   Single-energy imaging}","{MEDICAL PHYSICS}","{2013}","{40}","{5}",NA,"{MAY}","{Purpose: The use of an intravenously injected iodinated contrast agent
   could help increase the sensitivity of digital mammography by adding
   information on tumor angiogenesis. Two approaches have been made for
   clinical implementation of contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM),
   namely, single-energy (SE) and dual-energy (DE) imaging. In each
   technique, pairs of mammograms are acquired, which are then subtracted
   with the intent to cancel the appearance of healthy breast tissue to
   permit sensitive detection and specific characterization of lesions.
   Patterns of contrast agent uptake in the healthy parenchyma, and
   uncanceled signal from background tissue create a ``clutter{''} that can
   mask or mimic an enhancing lesion. This type of ``anatomical noise{''}
   is often the limiting factor in lesion detection tasks, and thus, noise
   quantification may be useful for cascaded systems analysis of CEDM and
   for phantom development. In this work, the authors characterize the
   anatomical noise in CEDM clinical images and the authors evaluate the
   influence of the x-ray energy used for acquisition, the presence of
   iodine in the breast, and the timing of imaging postcontrast
   administration on anatomical noise. The results are presented in a
   two-part report, with SE CEDM described here, and DE CEDM in Part II.
   Methods: A power law is used to model anatomical noise in CEDM images.
   The exponent, beta, which describes the anatomical structure, and the
   constant alpha, which represents the magnitude of the noise, are
   determined from Wiener spectra (WS) measurements on images. A total of
   42 SE CEDM cases from two previous clinical pilot studies are assessed.
   The parameters alpha and beta are measured both from unprocessed images
   and from subtracted images.
   Results: Consistent results were found between the two SE CEDM pilot
   studies, where a significant decrease in beta from a value of
   approximately 3.1 in the unprocessed images to between about 1.1 and 1.8
   in the subtracted images was observed. Increasing the x-ray energy from
   that used in conventional DM to those of typical SE CEDM spectra with
   mean energies above 33 keV significantly decreased alpha by about a
   factor of 19, in agreement with theory. Compared to precontrast images,
   in the unprocessed postcontrast images at 30 s postinjection, alpha was
   larger by about 7.4 x 10(-7) mm(2) and beta was decreased by 0.2. While
   alpha did not vary significantly with the time after contrast
   administration, beta from the unprocessed image WS increased linearly,
   and beta from subtracted image WS increased with an initial quadratic
   relationship that plateaued by about 5 min postinjection.
   Conclusions: The presence of an iodinated contrast agent in the breast
   produced small, but significant changes in the power law parameters of
   unprocessed CEDM images compared to the precontrast images. Image
   subtraction in SE CEDM significantly reduced anatomical noise compared
   to conventional DM, with a reduction in both alpha and beta by about a
   factor of 2. The data presented here, and in Part II of this work, will
   be useful for modeling of CEDM backgrounds, for systems characterization
   and for lesion detectability experiments using models that account for
   anatomical noise. (c) 2013 American Association of Physicists in

   combines CFB's intrinsic advantages (fuel flexibility and low SOx and
   NOx emissions) with oxygen-firing for CCS.
   This paper focuses on initial operational experiences of CIUDEN's 30MWth
   oxy-CFB facility. During the preliminary tests in spring 2012, and the

   Biodiesel is one of the best available resources that have come to the
   forefront recently. In this paper, a detailed review has been conducted
   to highlight different related aspects to biodiesel industry. These
   aspects include, biodiesel feedstocks, extraction and production
   methods, properties and qualities of biodiesel, problems and potential
   solutions of using vegetable oil, advantages and disadvantages of
   biodiesel, the economical viability and finally the future of biodiesel.
   The literature reviewed was selective and critical. Highly rated
   journals in scientific indexes were the preferred choice, although other
   non-indexed publications, such as Scientific Research and Essays or some
   internal reports from highly reputed organizations such as International
   Energy Agency (IEA), Energy Information Administration (EIA) and British
   Petroleum (BP) have also been cited. Based on the overview presented, it
   is clear that the search for beneficial biodiesel sources should focus
   on feedstocks that do not compete with food crops, do not lead to
   land-clearing and provide greenhouse-gas reductions. These feedstocks
   include non-edible oils such as Jatropha curcas and Calophyllum
   inophyllum, and more recently microalgae and genetically engineered
   plants such as poplar and switchgrass have emerged to be very promising
   feedstocks for biodiesel production.
   It has been found that feedstock alone represents more than 75\% of the
   overall biodiesel production cost. Therefore, selecting the best
   feedstock is vital to ensure low production cost. It has also been found
   that the continuity in transesterification process is another choice to
   minimize the production cost. Biodiesel is currently not economically
   feasible, and more research and technological development are needed.
   Thus supporting policies are important to promote biodiesel research and
   make their prices competitive with other conventional sources of energy.
   Currently, biodiesel can be more effective if used as a complement to
   other energy sources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}","{10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.003}","{1364-0321}","{ISI:000302823000024}","{Mekhilef, Saad/B-9652-2010

   endothermic animals, in that it is largely accomplished by controlling
   the temperature of our external environment. The objective of this study
   was to view the relationship between thermoregulatory energy use and
   environmental temperature in modern humans from the perspective of
   comparative physiology. Methods: Monthly residential energy use
   estimates from the US Energy Information Administration were divided by
   the annual number of American households from the US Census Bureau,
   giving average monthly energy consumption per American household for the
   years 2006 through 2010. Monthly energy consumption was then plotted
   against average monthly temperature across the United States from the
   National Climatic Data Center. Results: The resulting graph bore a
   striking resemblance to a classic Scholander-Irving curve, exhibiting
   clear upper (22 degrees C) and lower (15 degrees C) critical
   temperatures, and an increase in energy use as temperatures extend above
   (90 W degrees C-1 increase) or below (244 W degrees C-1 decrease) those
   critical temperatures. Allometric equations from comparative physiology
   indicate that the energetic costs of our current thermoregulatory habits
   are similar to 30 to 50 times those predicted for an endotherm of our
   size. Conclusions: Modern humans have redefined what it means to be a
   homeothermic endotherm, using large quantities of extrametabolic energy
   to regulate the temperature of our surroundings. Despite this
   sophistication, the signal of our individual physiology is readily
   discernible in national data on energy consumption. Am. J. Hum. Biol.,

   the Slovak Republic}","{EKONOMICKY CASOPIS}","{1998}","{46}","{2}","{202-218}",NA,"{The Slovak economy faces the strategic task of transforming its
   technology structure, raising its performance and integrating itself
   into the international division of labour with economically developed
   countries (EDCs). The problem of structure changes is not in trinsic to
   transitional economies only, EDCs meet this problem too. Know-how of
   this development can be instructive along several lines to master the
   changes that face the current economy of the Slovak Republic (SR).
   Since the sixties EDCs have experienced gradual manpower price increase,
   which especially in Western Europe proceeded faster than labour
   productivity increase. That discriminated above all labour intensive
   branches oriented on mass production In the seventies this development
   was aggravated by the steep price increase of raw materials and energy.
   These facts, accompanied by progress in science and technology and a
   drive of newly industrialized countries of south-east Asia with cheap
   manpower, changed the character of the competitive advantage of EDCs. In
   one decade a whole range of production branches went bankrupt, such as
   iron and steel metallurgy, textile production, ship-building etc.
   If price increase and limited natural resources lead on one side to seek
   new economical methods, on the other side the price increase of
   production factors opened the way towards more expensive investment and
   research intensive technologies. Factors based on the progress of
   science and technology became a moving force of a new type of
   competitive advantages. Unlike static factors of comparative advantages,
   which are usually linked to a certain geographical region, dynamic
   factors are characterized by greater mobility and are linked more and
   more to regions rich in science and research potential.
   The result of all this seems to be a high concentration of direct
   foreign investments in EDCs. The share of EDCs in the total inflow of
   direct foreign investments represented 85.4\% in 1980 and till 1992 this
   figure rose up to 88\%. Such a development means a new polarization of
   the world. In the year 1965, the seven wealthiest countries produced
   20-times more than the poorest countries. In the year 1995 this figure
   rose to 39 times.
   All these facts influence foreign trade too. The traditional exchange of
   commodities between autonomous independent firms has widened into
   international exchange within multinational companies. The share of
   intercompany exports in multinational companies USA reaches about 36\%,
   in manufacturing industry even double that figure. Such a change
   markedly narrows transfer channels of modem technologies through
   traditional foreign trade. Under the new conditions multinational
   companies try to gain advantages resulting from the progress in science
   and technology by founding daughter and sister companies of their own,
   and research institutes. In the year 1989 the enterprises of USA, Japan
   and EU placed 40\% of their research centres abroad, compared to only
   12\% in the year 1982. This means that the interest of investors is
   attracted not only by comparative advantages of production conditions,
   but increasingly comparative advantages of the intellectual potential in
   the relevant country.
   The advancing process of globalization, the growing importance of
   innovations and a more severe competition environment significantly
   increased the demand on information volume, its acquirement and
   handling. The share of people employed in information professions
   markedly rose. The transfer of the centre of gravity from physical work
   to brainwork introduced a whole range of new problems. Most important of
   these was the contradiction between labour productivity in information
   professions and in physical work. Solely in the period from 1975 to 1985
   the labour productivity increment in industry was 30 times as big as
   that in administration. The increase of those employed in information
   activities became st great obstacle to total labour productivity growth.
   This discrepancy resulted from the strategic orientation of industrial
   community predominantly oriented on the increase of the physical
   performance of the individual.
   The start of computer technology brought a solution of this
   contradiction. This technology together with telecommunication
   techniques provided material base of post-industrial development now
   designated the information society. In a short time it penetrated into
   all segments of economics and society and accelerated the rate of
   production restructuring in favour of products demanding information
   resources and qualified labour. Table 3 illustrates the development of
   manpower allocation in the USA proportionally by sectors and years, and
   Table 4 presents the share of people employed in information activities
   in the total of the active population proportionally in selected
   countries. The information society today has ceased to be a future
   vision only. It has a definite place in the economies of EDCs, creates
   new branches in the sphere of production and services.
   The changeover of the Slovak economy onto the development path of EDCs
   will not be easy. Foreign trade exchange of SR is still characterized by
   imports and exports of raw materials, fuels and intermediate products.
   Their share in the last three years has even increased. The Slovak
   economy registered an increasing comparative advantage against small
   economically developed countries in the years 1994-1996 only in
   intermediate products and short term consumer goods. The data of Table 6
   show that SR is reaching positive differences in comparative advantages
   in commodity groups demanding simple labour, physical capital and raw
   materials. At the same time the group of products demanding research,
   e.g. higher qualified labour, the negative difference increases (from
   -24.8 up to -30 points). The data of Table 7 witness the fact that SR
   gains comparative advantage against small economically developed
   countries above all in less technology demanding commodities. At the
   same time the share of university students in Slovakia per hundred
   thousand inhabitants is satisfactory, in the middle between developed
   and less developed countries of the EU. Due to worse technology
   equipment, to provide one million USD of GDP needs 4.82 students,
   whereas in economically developed countries one needs only 0.89
   students. it is clear that current technology equipment of production
   substantially reduces the efficiency of university educated
   professionals. Slovakia achieves, in the overall productivity measured
   by GDP per capita, only one third of the productivity currently achieved
   in the EU countries. In the education level SR occupies eleventh place
   among 15 EU countries (Table 9). This disproportion between the
   education level and labour productivity can be explained only by the
   fact that other production factors badly lag behind. One can see,
   therefore, that the factor of education and intellectual potential of SR
   is not lagging behind to such an extent as other production factors and
   has therefore the best chance to become a driving force of future
   development.}",NA,"{0013-3035}","{ISI:000075482900004}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   provides a framework to investigate the physical and economic

   study for an intersection in Lincoln, Nebraska, is used to demonstrate
   the application of evaluation procedures. The benefits of an RWPS are
   twofold: (a) the power generated by such a system can support the
   operation of traffic signals and any excess power produced can be sold
   back to the power grid; and (b) an RWPS provides a source of backup
   power in case of grid failure and thus increases the traffic network

   them to learn. In a classroom, as a teacher, it is desirable that one
   tries to bridge this gap at least on the key concepts of a particular
   field which is being taught. One such key concept which crops up in
   statistical physics/solid-state physics courses, and around which the
   behaviour of materials is described, is Fermi energy (epsilon(F)). In
   this paper, we present the results which emerged about misconceptions on
   Fermi energy in the process of administering a diagnostic tool called
   the Statistical Physics Concept Survey developed by the authors. It
   deals with eight themes of basic importance in learning undergraduate
   solid-state physics and statistical physics. The question items of the
   tool were put through well-established sequential processes: definition
   of themes, Delphi study, interview with students, drafting questions,
   administration, validity and reliability of the tool. The tool was
   administered to a group of undergraduate students and postgraduate
   students, in a pre-test and post-test design. In this paper, we have
   taken one of the themes i.e. Fermi energy of the diagnostic tool for our
   analysis and discussion. Students' responses and reasoning comments
   given during interview were analysed. This analysis helped us to
   identify prevailing misconceptions/learning gaps among students on this
   topic. How spreadsheets can be effectively used to remove the identified
   misconceptions and help appreciate the finer nuances while visualizing
   the behaviour of the system around Fermi energy, normally sidestepped
   both by the teachers and learners, is also presented in this paper.}","{10.1088/0143-0807/33/4/883}","{0143-0807}","{ISI:000305089200015}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   increased concern regarding the impacts of wind energy development on
   bats and other wildlife. We synthesized available information on
   patterns of bat fatalities from a review of 21 postconstruction fatality
   studies conducted at 19 facilities in 5 United States regions and one
   Canadian province. Dominance of migratory, foliage- and tree-roosting
   lasiurine species (e.g., hoary bat {[}Lasiurus cincreus]) killed by
   turbines was consistent among studies. Bat fatalities, although highly
   variable and periodic, consistently peaked in late summer and fall,
   coinciding with migration of lasiurines and other species. A notable
   exception was documented fatalities of pregnant female Brazilian
   free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in May and June at a facility
   in Oklahoma, USA, and female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris
   noctivagans) during spring in Tennessee, USA, and Alberta, Canada. Most
   studies reported that fatalities were distributed randomly across
   turbines at a site, although the highest number of fatalities was often
   found near the end Of turbine strings. Two studies conducted
   simultaneously in the same region documented similar timing of
   fatalities between sites, which suggests broader patterns of collisions
   dictated by weather, prey abundance, or other factors. None of the
   studies found differences in bat fatalities between turbines equipped
   with lighting required by the Federal Aviation Administration and
   turbines that were unlit. All studies that addressed relationships
   between bat fatalities and weather patterns found that most bats were
   killed on nights with low wind speed (<6 m/sec) and that fatalities
   increased immediately before and after passage of storm fronts. Weather
   patterns may be predictors of bat activity and fatality; thus,
   mitigation efforts that focus on these high-risk periods could reduce
   bat fatality substantially. We caution that estimates of bat fatality
   are conditioned by length of study and search interval and that they are
   biased in relation to how searcher efficiency, scavenger removal, and
   habitat differences were or were not accounted for. Our review will

   the electricity system in the United States, including the 10 NERC
   (North American Electric Reliability Council) regions, Alaska, Hawaii,
   off-grid non-utility plants and the US average figures. The greenhouse
   gas emissions associated with the United States electricity system are
   also estimated.
   Methods. The fuel mix of the electricity system based on year 2000 data
   is used. The environmental burdens associated with raw material
   extraction, petroleum oil production and transportation for petroleum
   oil and natural gas to power plants are adopted from the DEAM (TM) LCA
   database. Coal transportation from a mining site to a power plant is
   specified with the data from the Energy Information Administration
   (EIA), which includes the mode of transportation as well as the distance
   traveled. The gate-to-gate environmental burdens associated with
   generating electricity from a fossil-fired power plant are obtained from
   the DEAM (TM) LCA database and the eGRID model developed by the United
   States Environmental Protection Agency. For nuclear power plants and
   hydroelectric power plants, the data from the DEAM (TM) LCA database are
   used.
   Results and Discussion. Selected environmental profiles of the US
   electricity system are presented in the paper version, while the on-line
   version presents the whole LCI data. The overall US electricity system
   in the year 2000 released about 2,654 Tg CO2 eq. of greenhouse gas
   emissions based on 100-year global warming potentials with 193 g CO2 eq.
   MJe(-1) as an weighted average emission rate per one MJ electricity
   generated. Most greenhouse gases are released during combusting fossil
   fuels, accounting for 78-95\% of the total. The greenhouse gas emissions
   released from coal-fired power plants account for 81\% of the total
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation, and
   natural gas-fired power plants contribute about 16\% of the total. The
   most significant regions for the total greenhouse gas emissions are the
   SERC (Southeastern Electric Reliability Council) and ECAR (East Central
   Area Reliability Coordination Agreement) regions, which account for 22\%
   and 21\% of the total, respectively. A sensitivity analysis on the
   generation and consumption based calculations indicates that the
   environmental profiles of electricity based on consumption are more
   uncertain than those based on generation unless exchange data from the
   same year are available because the exchange rates (region to region
   import and export of electricity) vary significantly from year to year.
   Conclusions and Outlook. Those who are interested in the LCI data of the
   US electricity system can refer to the on-line version. When the
   inventory data presented in the on-tine version are used in a life cycle
   assessment study, the distribution and transmission losses should be
   taken into account, which is about 9.5\% of the net generation {[}1].
   The comprehensive technical information presented in this study can be
   used in estimating the environmental burdens when new information on the
   regional fuel mix or the upstream processes is available. The exchange
   rates presented in this study also offer useful information in
   consequential LCI studies.}","{10.1065/lca2004.09.176}","{0948-3349}","{ISI:000231025800011}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   which senses metabolic status from a wide range of humoral and neural
   signals, and controls energy intake. Accumulating evidence supports the
   model that stimulation of leptin-and ghrelin-responsive pathways,
   including the central melanocortin system, in the hypothalamus,
   contributes to the maintenance of body weight. Ghrelin is the brain-gut
   peptide with growth hormone-releasing and appetite-inducing activities.
   It is mainly secreted from the stomach and acts as an afferent signal to
   the hypothalamus and hindbrain. Leptin, the adipocyte hormone, is
   believed to tonically act as an afferent signal from adipose tissue to
   the brain, in particular hypothalamus, as a part of negative feedback
   loop regulating the size of energy stores and energy balance.
   Dysregulation of these pathways is a marker of changes in energy
   balance. Ghrelin is negatively correlated with weight and obese subjects
   have lower ghrelin levels than lean subjects, consistent with a
   compensatory rather than causal role for ghrelin in obesity. On the
   contrary, circulating leptin levels correlate in proportion to adiposity
   being high in obesity suggesting that human obesity is associated with
   insensitivity to leptin. The leptin resistance in diet-induced obesity
   emphasizes that environmental factors can modulate leptin sensitivity.
   It is speculated that through hypothalamic/pituitary axis ghrelin and
   leptin operate as a metabolic switch. Ghrelin actually transfers
   information from the stomach to the hypothalamus in cooperation with
   leptin and provides calories that growth hormone (GH) needs for growth
   and repair. Pharmacological manipulations of circulating hormone levels
   may work well in ``cheating{''} the brain regarding information from the
   periphery. It might also be necessary to combine two or three agents to
   fight obesity. A combination of drugs that decrease preprandial appetite
   (ghrelin antagonist) and increase post-prandial satiety (gut hormone
   fragment peptide YY 3-36) might have a chance of achieving sustained
   weight loss. The administration of exogenous satiety hormone peptide YY
   3-36 (PYY) may prevent the action of appetite-stimulating hypothalamic
   circuits on the anorexigenic melanocortin pathways.}","{10.1080/10284150400027107}","{1028-415X}","{ISI:000229071900001}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   the increased dopaminergic activity are responsible for the acute
   psychomimetic and psychostimulatory effects of
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, `'ecstasy'') and its congeners.
   In vulnerable subjects, at high doses or repeated use, and under certain
   unfavorable conditions (crowding, high ambient temperature), severe, in
   some cases fatal, averse systemic reactions (hyperthermia,
   serotonin-syndrome) may occur during the first few hours. Animal
   experiments revealed the existence of similar differences in
   vulnerability and similar dose-and context-related influences on; a
   similar sequence of acute responses. The severity of these acute
   systemic responses is closely related to the severity of the long-term
   damage to 5-HT axon terminals caused by the administration of
   substituted amphetamines. Attempts to identify the mechanisms involved
   in this selective degeneration of 5-HT presynapses brought to light a
   multitude of different factors and conditions which either attenuate or
   potentiate the loss of 5-HT terminals caused by MDMA and related
   amphetamine derivatives. These puzzling observations suggest that the
   degeneration of 5-HT presynapses represents only the final step in a
   sequence of events which compromise the ability of 5-HT terminals to
   maintain their functional and structural integrity. The common feature
   of all these events is a profound wastage of energy. Substituted
   amphetamines selectively tax energy metabolism in 5-HT presynapses
   through their ability to exchange with 5-HT and to dissipate
   transmembrane ion gradients. The active carrier systems in the vesicular
   and presynaptic membrane operate at a permanently activated state. The
   resulting energy deficit can no longer adequately restored by the 5-HT
   presynapses when their availability ability of substrates for ATP
   production is additionally reduced by the hyperthermic and other energy
   consuming reactions which are elicited by the systemic administration of
   substituted amphetamines. The exhaustion of energy in 5-HT nerve
   terminals compromise all energy-requiring endogenous mechanisms involved
   in the regulation of transmembrane-ion exchange, internal
   Ca++-homeostasis, prevention of oxidative stress, detoxification, and
   repair. Above a critical threshold the failure of these self-protective
   mechanisms will lead to the degeneration of the 5-HT axon terminals.
   Based on the role of 5-HT as a global modulatory transmitter-system
   involved in the stabilization and integration of impulse flow between
   distributed multifocal neuronal networks, the partial loss of 5-HT
   presynapses must be expected to impair the ability of these networks to
   maintain the integrity of signal flow pattern, and increase the
   likelihood of switching to unstable information processing. Behavioral
   responding may therefore become more dominated by activities generated
   in individual networks, and hitherto `'buffered'' personality traits and
   predisposition may become manifested as defined psychiatric syndromes in
   certain predisposed subjects.}","{10.1007/BF01285547}","{0300-9564}","{ISI:A1997YH66000001}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   accomplishment of school-related tasks and cognition.
   Design: We conducted a systematic review of the literature through the
   Pub Med database.
   Results: From the literature search, we identified 102 articles, 15 of
   which met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 3 studies provided
   information on the relation between cognitive and academic performance
   and energy intake at breakfast, 11 provided the same information for the
   macronutrient composition of breakfast, and 1 investigated both the
   aspects. Eleven studies considered breakfast meals differing in glycemic
   index/load. Selected studies were generally carried out in
   well-nourished children and adults of both sexes from general education.

   Conclusions: There is insufficient quantity and consistency among

   Objective: To assess how long it takes for three polymeric, hypercaloric

   through different nasointestinal tubes by gravity and whether these
   formulas obstruct the tubes.
   Methods: We evaluated the in vitro viscosity of the three formulas using
   a rotational viscometer and by calculating how long these formulas took
   to pass by free fall through the equipment and different calibre tubes.
   We also assessed the possible obstruction of the tubes or the equipment
   after the three formulas had been administered, simulating the
   administration conditions in clinical practice (1,500 ml over 24 h).
   Results: The administration time by gravity of 500 ml of each of the
   formulas studied was closely related to the viscosity determined in
   vitro of each of the formulas used. The larger the internal diameter of
   the tube, the shorter the emptying time by gravity or free fall. The

   infants}","{COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS}","{2014}",NA,"{4}",NA,NA,"{Background
   The ideal quantity of dietary protein for formula-fed low birth weight
   infants is still amatter of debate. Protein intake must be sufficient to
   achieve normal growth without negative effects such as acidosis, uremia,
   and elevated levels of circulating amino acids.
   Objectives
   To determine whether higher (>= 3.0 g/kg/d) versus lower (< 3.0 g/kg/d)
   protein intake during the initial hospital stay of formula-fed preterm
   infants or low birth weight infants (< 2.5 kilograms) results in
   improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes without evidence of
   short-and long-term morbidity.
   To examine the following distinctions in protein intake.
   1. Low protein intake if the amount was less than 3.0 g/kg/d.
   2. High protein intake if the amount was equal to or greater than 3.0
   g/kg/d but less than 4.0 g/kg/d.
   3. Very high protein intake if the amount was equal to or greater than
   4.0 g/kg/d.
   If the reviewed studies combined alterations of protein and energy,
   subgroup analyses were to be carried out for the planned categories of
   protein intake according to the following predefined energy intake
   categories.
   1. Low energy intake: less than 105 kcal/kg/d.
   2. Medium energy intake: greater than or equal to 105 kcal/kg/d and less
   than or equal to 135 kcal/kg/d.
   3. High energy intake: greater than 135 kcal/kg/d. As the Ziegler-Fomon
   reference fetus estimates different protein requirements for infants
   based on birth weight, subgroup analyses were to be undertaken for the
   following birth weight categories.
   1. < 800 grams.
   2. 800 to 1199 grams.
   3. 1200 to 1799 grams.
   4. 1800 to 2499 grams.
   Search methods
   The standard search methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were
   used. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register
   of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library) were searched.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials contrasting levels of formula protein
   intake as low (< 3.0 g/kg/d), high (< 3.0 g/kg/d but < 4.0 g/kg/d), or
   very high (>= 4.0 g/kg/d) in formula-fed hospitalized neonates weighing
   less than 2.5 kilograms were included. Studies were excluded if infants
   received partial parenteral nutrition during the study period or were
   fed formula as a supplement to human milk. Studies in which nutrients
   other than protein also varied were added in a post-facto analysis.
   Data collection and analysis
   The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used.
   Main results
   Five studies compared low versus high protein intake. Improved weight
   gain and higher nitrogen accretion were demonstrated in infants
   receiving formula with higher protein content while other nutrients were
   kept constant. No significant differences were seen in rates of
   necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or diarrhea.
   One study compared high versus very high protein intake during and after
   an initial hospital stay. Very high protein intake promoted improved
   gain in length at term, but differences did not remain significant at 12
   weeks corrected age. Three of the 24 infants receiving very high protein
   intake developed uremia.
   A post-facto analysis revealed further improvement in all growth
   parameters in infants receiving formula with higher protein content. No
   significant difference in the concentration of plasma phenylalanine was
   noted between high and low protein intake groups. However, one study
   (Goldman 1969) documented a significantly increased incidence of low
   intelligence quotient (IQ) scores among infants of birth weight less
   than 1300 grams who received a very high protein intake (6 to 7.2 g/kg).
   Authors' conclusions
   Higher protein intake (>= 3.0 g/kg/d but < 4.0 g/kg/d) from formula
   accelerates weight gain. However, limited information is available
   regarding the impact of higher formula protein intake on long-term
   outcomes such as neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Available evidence is
   not adequate to permit specific recommendations regarding the provision
   of very high protein intake (> 4.0 g/kg/d) from formula during the
   initial hospital stay or after discharge.}","{10.1002/14651858.CD003959.pub3}","{1469-493X}","{ISI:000335885000014}","{Al-Wassia, Heidi/C-8863-2015}",NA,"{CD003959}","{1361-6137}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   Results and conclusions: Use of stakeholders' panel as a platform for
   creating a rather robust ``body of information{''} proved to be valuable
   tool in the consultation processes, which resulted in a consensus of
   participating actors on strategic research topics and common recognition

   GIS-based modeling approach, which integrates a generic crop model and a
   hydraulic model of the transport/distribution system, using land use
   maps generated by Landsat TM imagery. The main sub-objectives are: (i)
   the development of an operational algorithm to retrieve crop
   evapotranspiration from remote sensing data, (ii) the development of an
   information system with friendly user interface for the data base, the
   crop module and the hydraulic module and (iii) the analysis and
   validation of management scenarios from model simulations predicting the
   respective behavior. The Lake Karla watershed is used in this study, but
   the overall methodology could be used as a basis for future analysis
   elsewhere. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to
   derive monthly actual evapotranspiration (ET) values from Landsat TM
   imagery. Meteorological data from the archives of the Institute for
   Research and Technology, Thessaly (I.RE.TE.TH) has also been used. The
   methodology was developed using high quality Landsat TM images during
   2007 growing season. Monthly ET values are used as an input to CROPWAT
   model. Outputs of CROPWAT model are then used as input for WEAP model.
   The developed scenario is based on the actual situation of the surface
   irrigation network of the Local Administration of Land Reclamation
   (LALR) of Pinios for the year of 2007. The DIS is calibrated with
   observed data of this year and the district parameterization is
   conducted based on the actual operation of the network. The operation of

   scenarios have been tested with the DIS:
   .Reduction of channel losses
   .Alteration of irrigation methods
   .Introduction of greenhouse cultivation
   .Operation of the future Lake Karla network The results of the
   simulation for the historical period indicate that the water pumped from
   Pinios LALR is not enough to serve irrigation requirements. The spatial
   and temporal variation of the unmet and unsatisfied water demand has
   been estimated. Simulation of the four alternative scenarios indicated
   that the alteration of irrigation methods scenario mainly increases the

   years despite more efficient technology advancements. This correlation
   between increased natural resource consumption and increased efficiency
   is known as jevons' Paradox. Since all the inputs to economic production
   come from the environment, increased resource consumption and ecosystem
   destruction should be of concern. Furthermore, the expenditure of
   natural resources to provide energy and other consumer goods is an
   irreversible process, worsening the human condition instead of improving
   human welfare as neoclassical theory would have one to believe.
   Therefore, sustainable development policies need to be considered to end
   the continued excess consumption, beyond sustainable levels, of natural
   resources and the potential resulting conflicts. To design
   environmentally sustainable policies, the effect of economic activity,
   of resource utilization, and increased efficiency must be understood. In
   this paper, we attempt to illustrate how human consumption of natural
   resources alters the natural state of the economy and the environment.
   Further, using energy data from the Energy Information Administration we
   develop models that provide some empirical support that jevons' Paradox
   may exist on a macro level. Finally, we examine the resulting policy
   implications and the applications for an ecological economic approach.

   (SSRIs) or norepinephrine (SNRIs) are effective in the treatment of
   disorders such as depression and anxiety. Cognitive psychological
   theories emphasize the importance of correcting negative biases of
   information processing in the nonpharmacological treatment of these
   disorders, but it is not known whether antidepressant drugs can directly
   modulate the neural processing of affective information. The present
   study therefore assessed the actions of repeated antidepressant
   administration on perception and memory for positive and negative
   emotional information in healthy volunteers.
   Method: Forty-two male and female volunteers were randomly assigned to 7
   days of double-blind intervention with the SSRI citalopram (20 mg/day),
   the SNRI reboxetine (8 mg/day), or placebo. On the final day, facial
   expression recognition, emotion-potentiated startle response, and memory
   for affect-laden words were assessed. Questionnaires monitoring mood,
   hostility, and anxiety were given before and after treatment.
   Results: In the facial expression recognition task, citalopram and
   reboxetine reduced the identification of the negative facial expressions
   of anger and fear. Citalopram also abolished the increased startle
   response found in the context of negative affective images. Both
   antidepressants increased the relative recall of positive (versus
   negative) emotional material. These changes in emotional processing
   occurred in the absence of significant differences in ratings of mood
   and anxiety. However, reboxetine decreased subjective ratings of
   hostility and elevated energy.
   Conclusions: Short-term administration of two different antidepressant
   types had similar effects on emotion-related tasks in healthy
   volunteers, reducing the processing of negative relative to positive
   emotional material. Such effects of antidepressants may ameliorate the
   negative biases in information processing that characterize mood and
   anxiety disorders. They also suggest a mechanism of action potentially
   compatible with cognitive theories of anxiety and depression.}","{10.1176/appi.ajp.161.7.1256}","{0002-953X}","{ISI:000222462700017}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   Holstein Dairy Cows}","{ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE}","{2015}","{43}",NA,NA,"{FEB 6}","{Background: Alterations in energy demands during different physiological
   states of dairy cows predispose them to metabolic disorders. Insulin as
   a main metabolic hormone has a key role to maintain homeorhesis in dairy
   cows. Insulin resistance phenomenon can expose these animals to
   metabolic dysfunctions. Information regarding insulin resistance at each
   physiological state of high producing dairy cows can assist
   veterinarians to control and prevent the metabolic disorders at herd
   levels.
   Materials, Methods \& Results: This research was carried out at winter
   2014 on 25 multiparous Holstein dairy cows from a high producing
   industrial dairy farm. The total mixed rations were formulated and
   prepared for all animals according to National Research Council (NRC)
   requirements. At this farm, a dry period of 60 days has been considered.
   Milk production was about 10,000 kg for year, an average of 3.6 of milk
   fat \%, and 3.3 of milk protein \%. All the animals were clinically
   healthy and body condition score (BCS) was estimated based on 0 to 5
   system. Cattle were divided into 5 equal groups containing early, mid
   and late lactations, far-off and close-up dry periods. A blood sample
   was taken immediately after catheterization, and dextrose 50\% was
   administered at 500 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg/h, subsequently. Blood samples were
   collected from all cows through the fixed catheter prior to and 1, 2, 3
   and 4 h after dextrose 50\% infusion in plain tubes. After sera
   separation, glucose and insulin were detected in all samples.
   Significant and rapid elevation of serum glucose and insulin
   concentrations were seen in all studied animals at 1st h after dextrose
   administration (P < 0.05). Decreasing the glucose level near to base
   line levels was seen at h 4 in late lactation and far-off dry cows. The
   glucose level at this time was remained significantly higher than h zero
   in other groups (P < 0.05). In early, mid and late lactation and
   close-up dry cows, insulin levels at h 4 were remained significantly
   higher than base line values (P < 0.05).
   Discussion: Cows during the early far-off dry period are experiencing
   relatively low metabolic demands as fetal growth is just beginning to
   accelerate and cows are no longer lactating. Fetal and uterine tissues
   are insulin-independent and so as energy demands increase with days of
   pregnancy, maternal peripheral tissues will become more insulin
   resistant in order to support fetal growth. These changes in the role of
   insulin have effects on energy metabolism in dry cows. Although pregnant
   dairy cows had essentially the same basal insulin levels as the
   lactating and non-pregnant non-lactating dairy cows, the amount of
   insulin secreted during infusion of glucose or propionate was higher in
   pregnant cows than in the lactating and non-pregnant non-lactating cows.
   The significant increasing patterns of insulin and glucose were seen
   after dextrose infusion in early lactation dairy cows ( P < 0.05). In
   the mid-lactation group the glucose at 4th h was significantly remained
   at higher levels than base line values. These findings indicate the
   presence of insulin resistance in early and mid lactation dairy cows. It
   was reported that insulin clearance rates had a tendency to decrease
   during the postpartum period. The reduced clearance of glucose observed
   at post partum was due to a greater degree of insulin resistance which
   gave rise to more pronounced net lipolysis from the adipocytes. These
   qualitative changes in metabolism occurring during lactation are
   necessary to support a homeostatic state. Despite the presence of high
   concentrations of insulin, high levels of glucose were seen in early and
   mid-lactation and close-up dry cows. The insulin resistance was found in
   early and mid lactation and close-up dry cows. It could be concluded
   that high energy demands to lactogenesis and suffering from the negative
   energy balance are the main reasons of insulin resistance in high
   producing Holstein dairy cows.}",NA,"{1678-0345}","{ISI:000356393000001}",NA,NA,"{1255}","{1679-9216}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   semistarvation before bowel function returns and adequate oral intake is
   allowed. It has been clearly shown that there is no need for restriction
   in oral intake after, at least lower, gastrointestinal surgery, and that
   early oral feeding does not increase the risk for dehiscense of the
   anastomosis. In contrast, early feeding reduces postoperative
   complications. Even if early oral intake is allowed, however, it is
   common that side effects such as nausea and vomiting prevent patients
   from reaching the target energy intakes. Thus, developing routines and
   treatments that promote sufficient early oral intake after surgery and
   maintain adequate energy intake in the postoperative period are probably
   of great importance for the outcome from surgery.
   Recent findings There are a number of factors which may facilitate early
   oral intake after gastrointestinal surgery including effective pain
   relief using epidural anaesthesia while avoiding opioids, minimizing
   sodium and fluid administration perioperatively and substantially
   reducing preoperative fasting. In addition, sufficient preoperative
   information, intensive mobilization, energy-dense hospital food and oral
   supplements may all contribute to improved energy intake after surgery.
   Summary In general, there is a great need for randomized controlled
   trials examining factors important for the regulation of oral intake
   after surgery and also the effects of early oral intake after upper
   gastrointestinal surgery. Future areas of research may also include
   regulation of appetite and use of peripherally acting opioid

   States of all sizes.
   This paper characterizes the commercial and industrial boilers in the 37
   states of the Midwest, Northeast, and Southern regions of the U.S. in
   term of number of units, unit capacity, aggregate capacity, and fuel
   type. A methodology is developed for evaluating and ranking the
   potential for converting from existing fossil-fuel boilers to biomass
   boilers in these states.
   In total, 3495 oil and coal boiler units in industrial and commercial
   buildings, and 1067 major wood energy facilities in the 37 eastern
   states were identified. These represent a subset of existing and
   potential conversions from fossil fuels to woody biomass. Based on this
   sample and energy consumption data from the Energy Information
   Administration (EIA), we estimate that there are currently 31,776 oil,
   coal, and propane boiler units over 0.5 MMBtus/hour capacity in these 37
   states, representing a total energy consumption of 1.7 quadrillion Btus,
   or roughly the equivalent of 287 million barrels of oil. Were these
   units all converted to woody biomass fuel, they would consume a total of
   121 million dry tons of wood per year, about three times the most recent
   US DOE estimates of woody biomass availability in those regions. Since
   only the most economical conversions typically occur, the reality of

   these functions, but originating from the periphery (adipose tissue) and
   carrying information mainly to central structures. Observations in
   rodent models of leptin deficiency have suggested that leptin
   participates;in the control of reproduction, in conjunction with that of
   food intake and energy expenditure. Indeed, leptin administration
   resulted in the restoration of normal body weight, food intake, and
   fertility in the ob mouse, lacking circulating leptin. Specific targets
   of leptin. in the hypothalamus are neurons expressing neuropeptide Y,

   liberal capitalism values when the significance of privatization,
   liberalization, globalization and New Public Management has sufficiently
   risen. Earlier, such rather specific regions as the Nordic countries,
   Latin America, Eastern and Southern Asia had introduced many elements
   similar to the Anglo-Saxon experience. Many Eastern European countries,
   upon rejecting totalitarian regimes, in fact without compromises have
   chosen the path of Western liberal capitalism, although this way was
   hindered by communist heritage, corruption and clientelism. However, not
   everybody in the world agreed with such a change of the economic-social
   paradigm. Mostly in the West, the intellectual critics of the system
   appeared, representing modern economic, political, social and
   cultural-philosophical theories. The economic crisis of 2008-2010 shook
   the world and promoted a radical criticism of capitalism. One of such
   critics is the Italian left-wing sociologist Franco Berardi (Bifo) who
   considers the contemporary economic system as dead and only artificially
   stimulated. The real values, according to E Berardi, must be not
   economic consumption and alienated work for satisfying one's needs, but
   spiritual and emotional values which can direct psychic energy towards
   the joy of life autonomous from capitalism. F. Berardi contrasts
   autonomy with the whole exhausted contemporary capitalist system which,
   in his opinion, does not have possibilities to expand.
   The article deals with the issue of refraining from capitalism which,
   according to the author, is not fruitful, because it is possible to
   ``improve{''} capitalism by imposing more equity (social justice). The
   author sees the biggest problem in society's division into ``winners{''}
   and ``loosers{''} who have no relations at all. Capitalism creates not
   only globalization, which is useful to the ``winners{''}, but also its
   antipode - glocalization - which imprisons a large part of population in
   geographically restricted social ghettos because of income, education,
   competence, age differences, illnesses and disability. The system's
   efficiency criterion, besides the well-known 3-E conception, should be
   the fourth E (equity), when it is necessary to pay attention to the
   problems of marginal groups. In order to reach social justice, it is
   necessary to implement new methods of social sciences, such as
   participatory research and benchmarking research. It is necessary to
   improve methods of public administration, first of all social
   administration methods, in order to provide efficiency for the benefit
   of social reintegration. It is necessary to diminish public
   administration ``transaction costs{''} and ``asymmetrical
   information{''}. Not only the well-known New Public Management methods,
   such as ``quality management{''} or clients' satisfaction surveys, but
   also less known methods such as global budgeting or priority planning
   should be used. New Public Management should be expanded or timely
   changed by New Governance values which supplement or change economic
   calculation by civil participation, democracy, active non-governmental
   activities, transparency and absence of corruption, diminishing of

   Firstly, we found that ICV injection of PrRP (94-1500 pmol)

   Design/methodology/approach - Intervention strategies, including
   educational media, information, and voluntary resource-conservation
   activities, were applied at varying levels of intensity across five
   study groups over two semesters in 2009. Additional questions explore
   whether one particular strategy would produce higher consumption
   reductions, and whether combining strategies would produce more
   consumption reductions than individual techniques.
   Findings - The findings revealed that on a campus where environmentally
   sustainability is foremost in the minds of students and administration,
   asking students to take action to reduce their consumption resulted in
   positive consumption reductions, even in the control group. Additive
   strategies did not produce higher reductions.
   Social implications - Reducing natural resource consumption in the USA
   is essential to promote worldwide sustainability. This study shows that,
   even when people see no financial incentive to reduce consumption,
   consumption reductions can be achieved.
   Originality/value - Numerous studies have been completed since the 1970s

   accession}","{EKONOMICKY CASOPIS}","{2002}","{50}","{4}","{605-619}",NA,"{Adequate institutional structure is a precondition for EU membership. As
   the reference date for accession is 2004, all relevant acquis should be
   implemented until the end of this year and so is expected adequate
   strengthening of capacities. In the accession process framework are
   specified another priorities (e.g. harmonization of legal system),
   measures for implementation and conditions for providing support.
   However, adaptation depends also on transparency of decision-making, law
   enforcement and elimination of corruption. Reform of public
   administration, made through decentralization, is based on operation of
   state administration and regional self-government and on changing
   competencies with the aim to reduce expenditures and improve services.
   Respected in this process are principles of subsidiarity and competitive
   environment.
   In general, there has been a strengthening of the system of governmental
   management bodies like, e.g., Custom directorate of the Slovak republic.
   In the case of public finance the gradual reductions of subsidies is the
   basic principle to be followed in the next future and market functioning
   should be improved via financial control over enterprises. Economic
   policy priorities have shifted from liberalization and privatization
   towards structural changes in corporate law. The amendment should
   increase transparency of ownership and business relations and,
   therefore, lead to a better corporate governance. Mentioned briefly are
   survey results on increasing ownership concentration of the biggest
   shareholders. Among central issues is also formation of competitive
   environment. Following acts on state assistance and on protection of
   economic competition, expected is approval of legal regulations allowing
   to provide group exceptions from prohibition of agreements limiting
   competition for certain agreements.
   Despite the fact that, as mentioned above, the state enforces liberal
   model of the economy based on transparency of business environment it
   also aims to develop some industries or branches to make Slovak
   industrial structure more similar to that of EU countries. Such changes
   should lead towards higher intra-industry trade, a feature typical for
   developed economics. Accepted concept of state science and technology
   policy, supporting participation in EU framework programs, faces problem
   with inadequate funding.
   In corporate law an amended bankruptcy act has enforced position of
   creditors which should speed-up corporate restructuring and recovery.
   Being aware of the positive role of foreign investment, the state
   promotes their inflows using certain policy measures like tax holiday
   etc. As a potential positive by-product of ending privatization is
   considered the possibility that completion of privatization could
   eliminate chances for corruption in state administration.
   Some changes have indirect impact on corporate costs or production.
   Poorly performing healthcare sector increases illness rates of workforce
   and problems in education sector negatively affects qualification of
   labor force. It is necessary, according to policymakers, to reform
   social system by changing the system of pension and social insurance and
   social aid. Reform of healthcare should guarantee transition towards
   predominantly ambulant form of care and decentralization of the whole
   system. Elementary healthcare insurance should be extended by
   supplementary insurance and optional commercial insurance schemes.
   In environmental protection the main principles are those related to
   sustainable development. National environmental action program SR II has
   originated and the realization of this policy is conditioned by
   introduction of environmental taxes, management and audit. Projected are
   also monitoring and information systems. Key role in the process of EU
   programs and implemented should be the administrative structure at NUTS
   11 level. Improvement of technical preparation of projects financed from
   EU structural funds is needed.
   In the area of free movement of goods it is necessary implement
   operational directives related to technical requirements for products.
   Act oil public procurement has already been implemented to a substantial
   degree acquis but real use has remained a problem. Legal changes should
   be followed by building of administrative capacities. One example is the
   need for coordination of the control of adjustment process in the area
   of Slovak technical norms in non-harmonized area.
   As general requirement, it is necessary to implement numerous laws in
   individual chapters in the whole EU directives agenda. Labor Code and
   laws oil state and public services, in the chapter of social policy and
   employment, were implemented recently but the remaining problem is
   flexibility, of labor market. Approval of the law oil network industries
   regulation, creation of regulatory office and removal of price
   distortions had prepared conditions for successful restructuring of
   energy industry. Passed was the law on emergency petrol reserves and
   petrol products and amended was the law oil state tangible reserves.
   Enforced will be the capacity of the Off ice for regulation of network
   industries due to the preparation of secondary legislature in this area.
   In a preliminary concluded chapter Protection of consumer and health
   remaining directives should be implemented, c. g., marking of consumer
   products with price tags.. and legislature regulating market
   supervision. Passed was also a custom act. full harmonized should be the
   scheme of General systcru of preferences (until 2004) and passcd should
   be all act on Export-import Bank of the SR. In preparatory stage is a
   new information society strategy.
   Progress in transposition of accession chapters is the subject of EC
   evaluations. Report on Preparedness (2001) positively evaluates number
   of measures already made. It states that progress has been reached in
   the areas of structure and functioning of administration, justice,
   legislature of internal market, corporate law and competition. Progress
   has to be made in agriculture sector and in enforcing of administrative
   capacities (e. g., management and control of EC funds). Improvement has
   been expected especially in the area of corporate law, competition,
   social policy and employment. Comparison of candidate countries made on
   the basis,of convergence indicator DCEI (DGZ Deka Bank) shows that the
   Slovak republic still lacks behind other candidate partners. However, in
   the area of institutional convergence is its evaluation better than is
   the total country rating. Evaluations have informative purpose only but
   for accession decisions one should look also oil non-economic (political
   and strategic) dimensions.}",NA,"{0013-3035}","{ISI:000178807200003}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   acids, is synthesized and secreted by adipose tissue, and impacts feed
   intake and the neuroendocrine-axis. Leptin was first identified as the
   gene product found deficient in the obese ob/ob mouse. Leptin, in the
   rodent, serves as a circulating signal of nutritional status and plays a
   pivotal role in regulation of body weight, energy expenditure, growth,
   and reproduction. Information regarding the effect of nutrition on serum
   leptin concentrations and subsequent luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth
   hormone (GH) secretion in domestic animals is limited. In the pig, serum
   leptin concentrations decreased by hr 24 of a 28 hr fast with no change
   in subcutaneous back fat thickness. However, plasma glucose and serum
   insulin concentrations were lower in fasted animals compared to fed
   controls. To examine the effects of metabolic fuel restriction on LH, GH
   and leptin secretion, ovariectomized (OVX) prepuberal gilts were treated
   with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a competitive inhibitor of glycolysis.
   Mean serum GH concentrations increased and LH pulse frequency decreased
   after i.v. administration of 300 mg/kg body weight of 2DG. However,
   serum leptin concentrations were not changed by 2DG treatment. These
   results demonstrate that the effects of acute energy deprivation on LH
   and GH secretion are independent of changes in serum leptin
   concentrations. Serum leptin concentrations increased with age in the
   intact prepuberal gilt. Ln addition, estradiol-induced leptin mRNA
   expression was age and weight dependent in the OVX prepuberal gilt. This
   increase occurred at the time of expected puberty in intact
   contemporaries and was associated with greater LH secretion. These data
   suggest that leptin may serve as a signal for the onset of puberty.
   Moreover, leptin receptor mRNA was localized in the hypothalamus and
   anterior pituitary of the pig, suggesting that leptin could act at the
   brain and(or) pituitary to regulate LH and GH secretion. In addition,
   leptin stimulated GnRH release from hypothalamic tissue in vitro.
   Studies with pig anterior pituitary cells in culture demonstrated that
   leptin treatment enhanced basal LH and GH secretion and suppressed
   gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and growth hormone releasing
   hormone (GHRH) induced increase in LH and GH secretion. Furthermore,
   intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of leptin suppressed feed
   intake and stimulated GH but failed to alter LH secretion in the intact
   prepuberal gilt. Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) is responsive to
   changes in energy balance and serum leptin concentrations in rodents.
   ICV administration of NPY suppressed LH secretion and increased GH
   secretion in the OVX pig. Thus, leptin/NPY may be an important link
   between metabolic status, the neuroendocrine system, growth, and
   reproductive processes.}","{10.1111/j.1439-0531.1999.tb01228.x}","{0936-6768}","{ISI:000082184200004}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   with certainty by physical examination methods, especially in the early
   or subclinical stage of the diseases.  Instrumental complementary
   examinations - X-ray, ultrasonography, laparoscopy - give information
   about the morphological changes.  Pathological changes in the hepatic
   function can be detected by chemical laboratory methods.
   Increase of the total bilirubin level of blood plasma indicates a
   subclinical icterus.  Of the hepatic enzymes, the activity of liver
   specific ALT increases even in case of mild hepatic changes.  AP is less
   liver specific, however it is also positive in case of chronic processes
   and portocaval shunt.  Increase of GLDH occurs in case of hepatic tissue
   destruction.  Activity of GGT increases in case of cholestasis and
   cholangitis.  Of the examinations of hepatic functions, the
   bromsulphalein test is reliable.  Increase of total bile acid level
   indicates specifically and unanimously the deterioration of the
   excreting and conjugating possibility of liver.  The ammonia tolerance
   test serves, first of all for the diagnosis of portocaval shunts.
   The simultaneous determination of ALT, AP and total bilirubin level is
   advisable:  when none of the levels increases above the physiological
   limit value, it is highly probable that the dog does not suffer from any
   hepatopathy.
   Treatment:  In case of an acute hepatic disease, elimination of the
   cause of disease, keeping alive the patient up to the start of hepatic
   regeneration by symptomatic treatment and promotion of regeneration are
   the main goals.  In case of chronic hepatopathies, it is necessary to
   endeavor to inhibit the deterioration of the progress of disease, to
   diminish the consequences of the deficit in the hepatic function.  In
   case of complex hepatoprotective therapy, a special care should be taken
   of the prevention of physical loading of patients.  It should also be
   stopped the administration of the formerly given, negligible
   medicaments.  Diet of the hepatopaths is a feed rich in energy, poor in
   protein and fat, and contains easily digestible carbohydrates.  In the
   field of medication, the administration of isotonic salines, as well as
   glucose infusions should be emphasized.  Parenteral administration of
   larger amounts of glucose (1 to 2 g/body-mass kg/day) serves also for
   energy substitution.
   Parenteral antibiotic treatment is useful for the thinning of the
   hepatic bacterial flora while the oral application of the intestinal
   bacteria.  Supplementation of vitamins B is an obligate part of
   medication; it is also often necessary to give vitamin K.  The
   administration of glutaminic acid + arginin infusion can be used for the
   treatment of hepatic coma, while lactulose syrup in case of acute
   hepatopathies.  Glucocorticoids can be applied as antiphlogistic, for
   the prevention of shock and as roborant.  The carefulness is reasonable
   because they can cause a steroidhepatopathy.
   Lipotropic medicaments, liver extracts do not belong to the effective
   medicaments in case of hepatic diseases of dogs.}",NA,"{0025-004X}","{ISI:A1994PF76800001}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   spreads throughout the atrial myocardium, thus defining the P-wave of
   the electrocardiogram. However, when the onset of paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation (PAF) approximates, a highly disturbed electrical activity
   occurs within the atria, thus provoking fragmented and eventually longer
   P-waves. Although this altered atrial conduction has been successfully
   quantified just before PAF onset from the signal-averaged P-wave
   spectral analysis, its evolution during the hours preceding the
   arrhythmia has not been assessed yet. This work focuses on quantifying
   the P-wave spectral content variability over the 2 h preceding PAF onset
   with the aim of anticipating as much as possible the arrhythmic episode
   envision. For that purpose, the time course of several metrics
   estimating absolute energy and ratios of high- to low-frequency power in
   different bands between 20 and 200 Hz has been computed from the P-wave
   autoregressive spectral estimation. All the analyzed metrics showed an
   increasing variability trend as PAF onset approximated, providing the
   P-wave high-frequency energy (between 80 and 150 Hz) a diagnostic
   accuracy around 80\% to discern between healthy subjects, patients far
   from PAF and patients less than 1 h close to a PAF episode. This
   discriminant power was similar to that provided by the most classical
   time-domain approach, i.e., the P-wave duration. Furthermore, the linear
   combination of both metrics improved the diagnostic accuracy up to
   88.07\%, thus constituting a reliable noninvasive harbinger of PAF onset
   with a reasonable anticipation. The information provided by this
   methodology could be very useful in clinical practice either to optimize
   the antiarrhythmic treatment in patients at high-risk of PAF onset and

   Significant differences (p<0.01) were observed for fasting blood glucose
   values between males (6.3 +/- 0.16 mmol L(-1)) and females (4.8 +/- 0.13
   mmol L(-1)), and males had a significantly (p<0.001) increased response
   to glucose. All animals returned to fasting glucose levels within 120
   min after the glucose challenge. No significant change in blood glucose
   levels was observed for either the alanine or propionate tolerance tests
   (p>0.05). However, following propionate administration, there was a
   highly significant (p<0.001) decrease in blood lactate concentrations
   over 120 min. There was no evidence of ketone formation using
   beta-hydroxybutyrate as a biomarker during any of the tests, indicating
   that there was no significant switch to lipolysis. In conclusion, the

   weight}","{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}","{2006}","{89}","{1}","{71-84}","{AUG 30}","{Ghrelin, an acylated upper gastrointestinal peptide, is the only known
   orexigenic hormone. Considerable evidence implicates ghrelin in mealtime
   hunger and meal initiation. Circulating levels decrease with feeding and
   increase before meals, achieving concentrations sufficient to stimulate
   hunger and food intake. Preprandial ghrelin surges occur before every
   meal on various fixed feeding schedules and also among individuals
   initiating meals voluntarily without time- or food-related cues. Ghrelin
   injections stimulate food intake rapidly and transiently, primarily by
   increasing appetitive feeding behaviors and the number of meals.
   Preprandial ghrelin surges are probably triggered by sympathetic nervous
   output. Postprandial suppression is not mediated by nutrients in the
   stomach or duodenum, where most ghrelin is produced. Rather, it results
   from post-ingestive increases in lower intestinal osmolarity
   (information probably relayed to the foregut via enteric nervous
   signaling), as well as from insulin surges. Consequently, ingested
   lipids suppress ghrelin poorly compared with other macronutrients.
   Beyond a probable role in meal initiation, ghrelin also fulfills
   established criteria for an adiposity-related hormone involved in
   long-term body-weight regulation. Ghrelin levels circulate in relation
   to energy stores and manifest compensatory changes in response to
   body-weight alterations. Ghrelin crosses the bloodbrain barrier and
   stimulates food intake by acting on several classical body-weight
   regulatory centers, including the hypothalamus, hindbrain, and
   mesolimbic reward system. Chronic ghrelin administration increases body
   weight via diverse, concerted actions on food intake, energy
   expenditure, and fuel utilization. Congenital ablation of the ghrelin or
   ghrelin-receptor gene causes resistance to diet-induced obesity, and
   pharmacologic ghrelin blockade reduces food intake and body weight.
   Ghrelin levels are high in Prader-Willi syndrome and low after gastric
   bypass surgery, possibly contributing to body-weight alterations in
   these settings. Extant evidence favors roles for ghrelin in both
   short-term meal initiation and long-term energy homeostasis, making it
   an attractive target for drugs to treat obesity and/or wasting
   disorders. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}","{10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.05.022}","{0031-9384}","{ISI:000240087400014}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"{3rd Food Summit Meeting on Making Sense of Food, Wageningen,

   insulin, leptin, and ghrelin, allows ARC to sense information from the
   periphery and signal it to the central nervous system. The ventromedial
   ARC (vmARC) mainly comprises orexigenic neuropeptide agouti-related
   peptide and neuropeptide Y neurons, which are sensitive to circulating
   signals. To investigate neural connections of vmARC within the central
   nervous system, we injected the neuronal tracer cholera toxin B into
   vmARC. Due to variation of injection sites, tracer was also injected
   into the subependymal layer of the median eminence (seME), which showed
   similar projection patterns as the vmARC. We propose that the vmARC
   forms a complex with the seME, their reciprocal connections with
   viscerosensory areas in brain stem, and other circumventricular organs,
   suggesting the exchange of metabolic and circulating information. For

   advancing age, and patients with hip fracture are often particularly
   malnourished and/or undernourished. Deficiency in both micronutrients
   and macronutrients appears to be strongly implicated in the pathogenesis
   and the consequences of hip fracture in osteoporotic elderly. Such
   deficiencies can accelerate age-dependent bone loss, increase the
   propensity to fall by impairing movement coordination, and affect
   protective mechanisms that reduce the impact of falling. With respect to
   micronutrients, the most documented information concerns calcium and
   vitamin D. Studies conducted in the elderly have shown that
   administration of calcium and vitamin D can reduce femoral bone loss
   and, in institutionalized patients, lower the incidence of hip fracture,
   Besides hypovitaminosis D, deficiency in vitamin K has been suggested to
   contribute to bone fragility in patients sustaining hip fracture. As far
   as macronutrients are concerned, low protein intake appears to play a
   distinct detrimental role in the causes and complications of hip
   fracture. In a recent survey in hospitalized elderly patients, reduced
   protein intake was associated with lower femoral neck bone mineral
   density (BMD) and poor physical performance. This observation is in
   keeping with several studies in which a state of energy-protein
   malnutrition was documented in elderly patients with hip fracture. In
   these patients, in whom we detected very low femoral neck bone mineral
   density at the level of the proximal femur, the self-selected intake of
   protein and energy was insufficient during their hospital stay.
   Interestingly, the clinical outcome after hip fracture was significantly
   improved by daily oral nutritional supplement normalizing the protein
   intake, documented as a reduction in both complication rate and median
   duration of hospital stay. Further studies showed that normalization of
   the protein intake, independently of that of energy, calcium, and
   vitamin D, was responsible for this more favorable outcome, Preliminary
   data suggest that protein supplementation may also reduce further bone
   loss in elderly patients having sustained hip fracture. Increasing the
   protein intake from low to normal could act through an increase in the
   plasma level of IGF-I, a growth factor that exerts a positive effect on
   bone mass and that has been found to decrease with aging.}","{10.1016/8756-3282(95)00494-7}","{8756-3282}","{ISI:A1996UD15900005}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"{3rd International Conference on Osteoporosis, PARIS, FRANCE, OCT   20,

   The present study aims to adapt WISDOM GIS methodology for application
   in the autonomous region of Asturias (Northern Spain) and thereby, by
   creating a geodatabase, to contribute to a support tool for
   investigating the potential of woodfuel. This will aid the public
   administration by providing information on woodfuel supply and demand at
   the regional, municipality and site-specific level, and thus assist in
   decision making in terms of formulating new energy strategies.
   In terms of supply (t year(-1)), in this work, woodfuel from forest area
   is defined as the crown fraction only (branches and leaves), although in
   the case of Eucalyptus spp., bark is also included as it is remains
   on-site following extraction of eucalypts for the pulp industry.
   Non-Forest Direct Supply was calculated on the basis of the relevant
   categories from an agricultural land use inventory and average woodfuel
   productivity. In addition, physical and legal constraints related to
   accessibility of the woodfuel were considered, the former applying
   restriction filters with values weighted depending on the interaction
   between slope map, road networks and centres of population, and the
   latter considering legal limitations in protected areas. In addition,
   unused waste from the wood processing industry was included. To
   calculate total woodfuel demand (t year-1) for energy generation (heat
   and electricity), both the residential and industrial sector were taken
   into account.

   demands easy and non-invasive measurement of the CYP phenotype. Breath
   tests detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the patients' exhaled

   from established models in the literature and validated against publicly
   available data extracted from the DrugBank. (2) Likely sites of
   metabolism were identified by reactivity and accessibility estimation

   (O- and N-dealkylations) were found to be most promising in the release
   of VOCs. Thus, the CYP-catalyzed oxidative degradation reaction was
   encoded as SMIRKS (a programming language style to implement reactions
   based on the SMARTS description) to enumerate possible reaction
   products. (4) A quantitative structure property relation (QSPR) model
   aiming to predict the Henry constant H was derived from data for 488

   products. (5) A blacklist of naturally occurring breath components was
   implemented to identify marker molecules allowing straightforward

   Evident oxidative degradation reactions served as test case for the

   support the results' plausibility. Thus, a large scale screening for

   methodology was used to identify processes within asphalt recycling and
   reuse that contribute a significant share of the total environmental
   impact (hotspots), and to compare the life cycle environmental
   performance of the main techniques used for asphalt recycling and reuse

   The results showed that hot in-place recycling gave slightly more global

   hot in-plant recycling. There were no savings of GWP and small savings
   of CED during asphalt reuse. It was concluded that asphalt recycling is
   environmentally preferable to asphalt reuse. However each method of
   asphalt recycling can provide different benefits, so possibilities exist
   for improving the environmental performance of the processes involved.

   increase food intake. It is released from the stomach and is thought to
   function as a signal of energy deficit and a meal initiator. We
   generated transgenic mice in which levels of bioactive ghrelin are
   increased in the stomach and circulation. These mice, as expected, are
   hyperphagic and glucose intolerant. We investigated whether exposure to
   a high-fat diet (HFD) would exacerbate this phenotype. METHODS: We
   investigated the effect of HFD on energy and glucose homeostasis in
   ghrelin transgenic mice. We determined dietary preference; expression of
   hypothalamic neuropeptides that control food intake; and, using
   fast-performance liquid chromatography, the circulating forms of
   ghrelin. We measured food intake during continuous administration of
   ghrelin in wild-type mice fed either regular chow or an HFD. RESULTS:
   Ghrelin transgenic mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity because
   of their reduced food intake. This was not caused by alterations to food
   preference, hypothalamic signaling of neuropeptides that control food
   intake, or the form of circulating acylated ghrelin. Long-term
   administration of ghrelin to wild-type mice failed to increase ingestion
   of an HFD but, as expected, increased intake of regular chow.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that diets high in fat inhibit the
   hyperphagic effect of ghrelin; these findings indicate that features of
   the diet are important determinants of ghrelin's function. This
   information is important for the development of anti-obesity drugs that

   (CERVUS-ELAPHUS) AND FALLOW DEER (DAMA-DAMA) BY STRATEGIC ADMINISTRATION
   OF EXOGENOUS MELATONIN}","{ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE}","{1993}","{33}","{1-4}","{267-287}","{OCT}","{There is often a poor synchrony between the high energy demands of
   lactation in summer and the peak of pasture production and quality
   occurring in spring for red deer (Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama
   dama) farmed under pastoral conditions in temperate climates.
   Considerable research within the last decade has investigated either
   daily administration or constant infusion of exogenous melatonin in
   order to advance the breeding season and hence the seasonal pattern of
   births of farmed deer and, therefore, align lactation and feed
   production. Melatonin is the hormone involved in the transduction of
   photoperiodic information to the endocrine system leading to precise
   timing of reproduction.
   Owing to the absence of pregnancy and lactation, the pubertal hind/doe
   provides the simplest model for exogenously controlling the seasonality
   of oestrus, ovulation and conception. All forms of exogenous melatonin
   delivery initiated in summer (10-12 months of age) are effective in
   advancing the onset of puberty. However, the degree of advancement
   relative to control females has been highly variable, reflecting a wide
   range of treatment protocols. The most significant variables appear to
   be the time of onset of treatment and the degree of social interaction
   between treated and control animals. Initiation of treatments less than
   100 days after the winter solstice are likely to delay puberty by
   impinging upon a possible photoperiod entrainment period. Initiation of
   treatments more than 100 days after the solstice advances puberty, with
   progressively later initiation dates generally resulting in smaller
   degrees of advancement. Melatonin-treated red deer hinds and stags
   appear to influence the timing of puberty of contiguous control hinds.
   The maximum degree of puberty advancement so far achieved by melatonin
   treatment has been 54 days for red deer and 56 days for fallow deer.
   In adult female deer, lactation does not appear to markedly influence
   the degree of phase shifting by melatonin treatment. However, because
   melatonin treatment initiated before the end of pregnancy, 140-170 days
   after the winter solstice, may prevent lactogenesis, the use of
   melatonin is contra-indicated during pregnancy. Treatment initiation
   after the onset of lactation does not appear to influence milk yields,
   as evidenced by calf/fawn growth rates.
   Treatment of adult male red and fallow deer during summer advances all
   aspects of reproductive seasonality. Coincident treatment of males and
   females appears to result in coincident early rutting and oestrous
   activity, leading to high conception rates. Long-term consequences of
   treatment of red deer stags include early sexual quiescence and
   occasional expression of transient testicular cycles, with
   re-synchronisation of treated and control stags occurring 14-15 months
   after the initiation of treatment. However, initiation of treatment of
   red deer stags less than 50 days after the winter solstice delays sexual
   quiescence and sexual recrudescence, indicating that increasing
   photoperiod in early spring is important in the entrainment process.
   While seasonal birth/lactation patterns for red and fallow deer can be
   advanced by exogenous melatonin treatment, research is needed to
   elucidate the actual effects on overall productivity, particularly in
   relation to calf/fawn growth rates and the impact of precocious puberty
   in early-born animals.}","{10.1016/0378-4320(93)90119-C}","{0378-4320}","{ISI:A1993MD96300017}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   The global annual mean values of R-s were 186.7 w m(-2), 185.4 w m(-2),
   and 188.6 w m(-2) for CERES-EBAF, ISCCP-FD, and GEWEX-SRB V3.0
   respectively. The averaged global annual mean R-s value from
   ground-measured-calibrated three satellite derived R-s products was
   180.6 w m(-2), which is smaller than that estimated from individual
   satellite-derived products. The CERES-EBAF product shows the best
   accuracy among these four data sets, which indicates that including more
   accurate cloud information from active instruments can improve the
   accuracy of R-s. These satellite products show different temporal
   trends. Both GEWEX-SRB V3.0 and ISCCP-FD showed similar trends at the
   global scale but with different magnitudes. A significant dimming was
   found between 1984 and 1991, followed by brightening from 1992 to 2000,
   and then by a significant dimming over 2001-2007. The CERES-EBAF product
   showed a brightening trend, but not significantly since 2000. The
   variability from satellite estimates at pixel level was also analyzed.
   The results are comparable with previous studies based on observed R-s
   at the surface for specific regions, although some inconsistencies still
   exist and the magnitudes of the variations should be further quantified.
   We also found that clouds contribute more to the long-term variations of
   R-s derived from satellite observations than aerosols. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   samples from female CD-1 mice before and after cerebral ischemia induced

   of different anesthetic drugs. We found that all of the injectable
   anesthetics tested (ketamine/xylazine, chloral hydrate, propofol and
   pentobarbital) caused a decrease in blood pH and partial pressure of
   oxygen (pO(2)) and an increase of partial pressure of carbon dioxide
   (pCO(2)), indicating respiratory depression. This was not observed with
   inhalable anesthetics such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and halothane.
   Significant and up to two-fold increases of blood glucose concentration
   were observed under isoflurane, halothane, ketamine/xylazine, chloral
   hydrate, and propofol anesthesia. Lactate concentration rose
   significantly by 2-3-fold during inhalation of isoflurane and halothane
   treatment, but decreased by more than 50\% after administration of
   pentobarbital. Permanent cerebral ischemia induced respiratory acidosis
   (low pH and pO(2), high pCO(2)) which was most prominent after 24 h.
   Postsurgical treatment with Ringer-lactate solution (1 mL,

Life Cycle Assessment is a technique for
   evaluating the environmental performance of a given product by:
   identifying and quantifying the energy and raw materials used in its
   manufacturing process, as well as the emissions of pollutants to water,
   soil, and air inherent in this production, use and disposal, and
   evaluating the environmental impact associated with the use of energy
   and materials and the emissions of pollutants, thus identifying
   opportunities to improve the system in order to optimize the
   environmental performance of the product. CETEA (Packaging Technology
   Center) has conducted a Life Cycle Assessment - LCA study of aluminum
   can with emphasis in life cycle inventory, collecting data for the
   reference years 2000-2002. The goal of this paper is to present part of
   this complete study, focusing the influence of aluminum recycling rate
   on the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) of aluminum beverage cans in Brazil.
   Methods. The adopted methodology was based on the recommendations of
   SETAC - Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry and the ISO
   14040 Standard, approved by the Sub-Committee 05 of the Environmental
   Administration Technical Committee, TC-207, from ISO - INTERNATIONAL
   ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION {[}1,2]. Data storage and modeling were
   performed by employing the PIRA Environmental Management System - PEMS
   {[}3].
   Results. Taking into account the impact categories adopted in this
   study, it has been shown that recycling helps to improve the aluminum
   can environmental profile measured as LCI data.
   Discussion. For the transformed aluminum products, the recycling rate
   affects the values of the environmental parameters inventoried, but not
   in the same proportion, since the contribution of other stages of the
   product system life cycle and the recycling process remain unchanged,
   including the yield of this process. In general, the recycling balance
   is always positive due to the importance of the stages that precede the
   packaging production and the problem of increasing the municipal waste
   volume.
   Conclusions. The advantages of the recycling are obviously concentrated
   on the inventoried parameters related to the primary aluminum production
   and to the package disposal. The verified benefits of the recycling
   increase with the recycling rate enhancement. However, the effects on
   the inventory do not have the same magnitude of the recycling rate. This
   happens due to the relative contributions of the other life cycle
   stages, such as the transportation and sheet or can production. In
   agreement with the presented results, it is possible to conclude that
   the aluminum can recycling reduces part of the consumption of natural
   resources and the emissions associated to the stages previous to the
   production of the packaging. The parameters specifically related to the
   stage of aluminum production suffer reduction directly proportional to
   the increase of the recycling rate. In this way, all of the efforts made
   to increase the recycling rate will have a positive contribution to the
   LCI of the aluminum can.
   Recommendations. It is worth pointing out that LCA studies are iterative
   and dynamic. The data can always be refined, substituted or complemented
   with updated information in order to improve the representativeness of
   the analyzed sector.
   Perspectives. From this study, the aluminum sector in Brazil is able to

   Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook (WEO) or the Energy Information
   Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) rely on estimated
   levelized costs for nuclear power and other power generation
   technologies. These levelized cost estimates show nuclear to be a very
   competitive power generating technology in most regions of the world.
   This paper analyzes unpublished data from the 2011 WEO to assess the
   competitiveness of nuclear power in liberalized and non-competitive
   power markets. We consider alternative estimates of nuclear capital
   costs (Risk Scenario) that might well be considered before investing in
   nuclear power in competitive markets without government guarantees. The
   Risk Scenario also assumes lower natural gas prices that could result
   from higher shale gas recovery in the United States and new shale gas
   development in Europe. The Risk Scenario causes the relative cost
   difference of nuclear power vs. natural gas to change by 5 cents/kWhr.
   Instead of nuclear power holding a competitive advantage over natural
   gas, in the Risk Scenario, natural gas gains a competitive advantage
   over nuclear power, even if a \$50/ton CO(2)e charge is assessed.
   The analysis suggests that nuclear power plants will not be built in
   liberalized power markets without government guarantees. If nuclear
   power plants built with government support or those built by state-owned
   power industries prove that nuclear power plants can be reliably built
   at a competitive cost, power plant economics will be a significant
   positive factor for the nuclear industry, especially taking into
   consideration national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. If costs continue to increase over the estimates being used
   by the IEA and EIA, power-plant economics become a significant negative
   factor for the nuclear industry that may not be offset by pricing CO2
   emissions.
   These findings do not apply to reactor projects in many Asian countries.
   Nuclear power is estimated to enjoy a more favorable cost advantage than
   in the United States, Europe or Japan. In addition, private financing is
   less important in many Asian countries and delays due to licensing
   problems are less likely. Given the high electricity demand growth
   expected in Asia, more competitive costs, and government support, it is
   not surprising that over 60\% of currently-planned nuclear reactors are

   model}","{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT}","{2007}","{12}","{6}","{365-372}","{SEP}","{Background, Aims and Scope. Life cycle assessment models typically use
   product-specific, plant-level or national aggregate data. However, many
   decisions by regional policy makers would be better informed by local or
   regional aggregate data. This research is intended to construct and
   apply a regional US economic input-output analysis-based life cycle
   assessment (REIO-LCA) model based upon publicly available datasets. The
   model uses Gross State Product (GSP) estimates to calculate regional
   economic multipliers and then link them to regional electricity and fuel
   use, and air emission factors. Target audiences are governmental
   decision makers, industry experts and researchers concerned,with the
   regional economic and environmental effects of public and private
   decisions.
   Methods. A regional version of the existing US EIO-LCA model was
   developed using-regional economic multipliers and state environmental
   data. The national model is based on the US 491 by 491 economic
   input-output model, and uses sectoral energy consumption and emission
   factors to approximate the environmental effects of production and
   services. The proportion of the regional value added (Gross State
   Product) to the national value added for each sector was used to develop
   economic multipliers to allocate the output of industries to individual
   states and multi-state regions. Inter-sectoral transaction matrices were
   constructed for eight regions. Regional environmental emission and
   resource use factors were formed based upon publicly available data of
   the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy.
   The Toxics Release Inventory include facility location parameters,
   enabling the estimation of sectoral toxic emissions for the regions. The
   national electricity and fuel use, air pollutants (CO, NOx, PM10, SO2
   and VOC) and greenhouse gas emissions used by the EIO-LCA model were
   proportioned based upon state totals for each sector.
   Results. A regional economic input-output model was created for US
   regions; and sectoral energy use and environmental emission factors were
   estimated for Pennsylvania, the Far West (Alaska, California, Hawaii,
   Nevada, Oregon and Washington) and the Mideast (Delaware, District of
   Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) economic
   areas. The use of the framework for regional IO-LCA model is
   demonstrated through two case studies.
   Discussion. As a validation exercise, the regional outputs of petroleum
   refineries were calculated using the regional input-output matrices and
   the outcomes were compared to the Energy Information Administration's
   (EIA) Petroleum State Profile data. The model results show that
   approximately 70\% of the total national sectoral production takes place
   in three regions, i.e., South West, South East and Far West, which
   corresponds with the EIA statistics. The REIO-LCA model constructed for
   the Far West is used to conduct a second case study estimating the
   annual toxic air emissions of power plants in the region in 2003. The
   results are evaluated by comparison to data provided by the US EPA. The
   estimated pollutions do not differ significantly from those presented in
   the Toxics Release Inventory reports.
   Conclusions. The usefulness of IO LCA models can be improved through the
   incorporation of local economic and environmental characteristics. Wiht
   the lack of US regional sectoral data, the allocation of national
   industrial production to regions can provide a framework to create
   smaller scale IO models. The results of case studies support the
   assumption that the GSP multipliers may be used to allocate the sectoral
   production to the regions, and show that the framework IO LCA model
   provides a reasonable approximation of supply chain economic activities
   and environmental effects caused by production and services.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The quality of data, e.g., age and
   level of aggregation, and the assumed linearity between sectoral outputs
   and environmental emissions represent the main sources of uncertainty in
   the model. The results show that the GSP estimates are appropriate to
   construct a framework for a regional economic input-output and
   environmental assessment model. However, further research is recommended
   to construct more specific state-level input-output matrices
   incorporating interstate commodity flows, and state environmental
   factors in order to mitigate the parameter uncertainties. Further, the
   model might be improved by updating it regularly, as more recent data
   become available.}","{10.1065/lca2007.04.318}","{0948-3349}","{ISI:000250314200003}",NA,"{Hendrickson, Chris/0000-0002-9812-3580}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   measurements of the nadir-viewing Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment
   (GOME) instrument. Currently, four different approaches are used to
   retrieve ozone profile information from GOME measurements, which differ
   in the use of external information and a priori constraints. In total
   nine different algorithms will be evaluated exploiting the optimal
   estimation ( Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, Rutherford
   Appleton Laboratory, University of Bremen, National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory),
   Phillips-Tikhonov regularization ( Space Research Organization

   Aerospace Center) approaches. Analysis tools are used to interpret data
   sets that provide averaging kernels. In the interpretation of these
   data, the focus is on the vertical resolution, the indicative altitude
   of the retrieved value, and the fraction of a priori information. The
   evaluation is completed with a comparison of the results to lidar data
   from the Network for Detection of Stratospheric Change stations in
   Andoya ( Norway), Observatoire Haute Provence ( France), Mauna Loa (

   ozone profiles and allows the analysis of GOME data measured in
   different global regions and hence observational circumstances. The main
   conclusion of this paper is that unambiguous information on the ozone
   profile can at best be retrieved in the altitude range 15 - 48 km with a
   vertical resolution of 10 to 15 km, precision of 5 - 10\%, and a bias up
   to 5\% or 20\% depending on the success of recalibration of the input

   Cranes are remarkable and invaluable tools for hoisting and carrying:
   Like all other tools they have significantly increased humans' capacity
   to work; they marshal far more energy than can human or animal muscle.
   However, the large quantities of energy involved and the
   human-crane-environment interactions required result in there being a
   high potential for damage to occur to people and equipment. The current
   situation is that similar serious crane occurrences continue to
   repeatedly recur, albeit separated in terms of time and space. As a
   result, crane fatalities can be considered as endemic, at least; many
   would suggest epidemic. To gain sufficient insight into the aetiology of
   crane-related damage, and establish key focus areas for future control,
   there is a need to establish the pattern of crane-related damaging
   occurrences. To achieve this for fatalities, an approach was made to the
   US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which provided
   over 500 crane fatality narratives for the years 1985-1945. This
   information was scientifically organised using the taxonomic process
   involving observation, description and classification of the data into
   groups. The pattern is presented along with discussion regarding the
   application and limitations of the information. The data are intended to
   add to the information base of crane designers, owners and users in
   order to challenge the status quo and generate effective change for the

   for problems with a large number of players. The proposed scheme can
   enable an individual node in MANETs to make strategic security defence
   decisions without centralized administration. In addition, since
   security defence mechanisms consume precious system resources (e. g.,
   energy), the proposed scheme considers not only the security requirement
   of MANETs but also the system resources. Moreover, each node in the
   proposed scheme only needs to know its own state information and the
   aggregate effect of the other nodes in the MANET. Therefore, the
   proposed scheme is a fully distributed scheme. Simulation results are

   is known about the impact of such labeling on T-cell function, and most
   imaging methods do not provide holistic information about trafficking
   kinetics, homing sites, or quantification. Methods: We developed
   protocols that minimize the inhibitory effects of
   Cu-64-pyruvaldehyde-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-64-PTSM)
   labeling on T-cell function and permit the homing patterns of T cells to
   be followed by PET. Thus, we labeled ovalbumin (OVA) T-cell receptor
   transgenic interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing CD4(+) T (Th1) cells with
   0.7-2.2 MBq of Cu-64-PTSM and analyzed cell viability, IFN-gamma
   production, proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA double-strand breaks and
   identified intracellular Cu-64 accumulation sites by energy dispersive
   x-ray analysis. To elucidate the fate of Th1 cell homing by PET, 107
   Cu-64-OVA-Th1 cells were injected intraperitoneally or intravenously
   into healthy mice. To test the functional capacities of Cu-64-OVA-Th1
   cells during experimental OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity, we
   injected 10(7) Cu-64-OVA-Th1 cells intraperitoneally into OVA-immunized
   or nonimmunized healthy mice, which were challenged with OVA peptide or
   phosphate-buffered saline or remained untreated. In vivo PET
   investigations were followed by biodistribution, autoradiography, and
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Results: PET revealed
   unexpected homing patterns depending on the mode of T-cell
   administration. Within 20 min after intraperitoneal administration,
   Cu-64-OVA-Th1 cells homed to the perithymic lymph nodes (LNs) of naive
   mice. Interestingly, intravenously administered Cu-64-OVA-Th1 cells
   homed predominantly into the lung and spleen but not into the perithymic
   LNs. The accumulation of Cu-64-OVA-Th1 cells in the pulmonary LNs (6.8
   +/- 1.1 percentage injected dose per cubic centimeter {[}\%ID/cm(3)]) 24
   h after injection was highest in the OVA-immunized and OVA-challenged
   OVA airway hyperreactivity-diseased littermates 24 h after
   intraperitoneal administration and lowest in the untreated littermates
   (3.7 +/- 0.4 \%ID/cm(3)). As expected, Cu-64-OVA-Th1 cells also
   accumulated significantly in the pulmonary LNs of nonimmunized
   OVA-challenged animals (6.1 +/- 0.5 \%ID/cm(3)) when compared with
   phosphate-buffered saline-challenged animals (4.6 +/- 0.5 \%ID/cm(3)).
   Conclusion: Our protocol permits the detection of Th1 cells in single
   LNs and enables temporal in vivo monitoring of T-cell homing over 48 h.

   provides 3 behavioral measure thought to reflect underlying neural
   adaptations to repeated drug exposure. Neurochemical measures have
   provided information about the specific neural systems impacted and
   altered by repeated drug exposure. In pre-clinical studies, sensitized
   animals exhibit facilitated acquisition of drug self-administration and
   preference for cues associated with past drug experiences. This has
   suggested a role for sensitization in the development of drug abuse and
   in relapse. In humans, self-reports of sensitized vigor and energy
   levels have been described that may relate to the more direct
   measurements of locomotor sensitization in animals. Described in this
   chapter are methods used to measure psychomotor sensitization in mice,
   which are partially dependent upon the drug under investigation. The
   advantages to the use of mice in pre-clinical research are (1) that they
   readily sensitize to all drugs of abuse, (2) many methods have been
   developed for studying other aspects of their behavior that may be
   related to sensitization, and (3) they are an excellent species for
   genetic investigations aimed at determining susceptibility to behavioral
   sensitization and thus neuroadaptations related to drug abuse. Factors
   to consider when designing a study of drug-induced psychomotor
   sensitization include dose, number or treatments, frequency or interval
   between treatments and challenge, and duration of testing. First, a
   measure of baseline level of activity should be obtained, followed by
   measurement of the initial drug effect, measures of the change in
   initial effect with repeated administration, and a subsequent measure of
   baseline to see how it may have changed after repeated drug testing.
   Depending upon the goal of the research, a drug withdrawal period may be
   desirable, followed by another drug challenge to determine whether
   sensitization is still present. Such a withdrawal or ``incubation{''}
   period has been instated to allow for the establishment of long-term
   central nervous system changes that may accompany sensitization in
   studies of mechanism. The recommended frequency of dosing is dependent
   upon characteristics of the drug, particularly its clearance rate. More
   intermittent schedules of administration are particularly important for
   inducing robust sensitization to classical psychostimulant drugs like
   cocaine and methamphetamine. The recommended duration of:testing is
   influenced by the duration of drug effect, but data should be collected
   in isolated time units so that the time response curve can be examined.
   Finally, associative conditioning and stress-related factors can have
   large impacts on sensitization and should be carefully considered in all
   aspects of the research design, including whether drug treatment is
   linked to the test environment or not, density of housing, and specifics
   of handling.}","{10.1007/978-1-60761-883-6\_11}","{0893-2336}","{ISI:000283191100011}",NA,NA,NA,NA,"{Raber, J}","{ANIMAL MODELS OF BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS}","{978-1-60761-882-9}",NA,NA,"{Neuromethods}",NA

   Material/Methods: Different skeletal sites of sham, OVX-Diet and

   even knowing what it is you might discover. We were hopeful prospectors
   on our first LEED project, not exactly sure what we might strike. We
   sought silver sustainability for the University of New Mexico (UNM)
   College of Education Building (COE); what we discovered was even more
   precious and rare, platinum. Getting there entailed chipping away at
   each sustainable LEED credit until we hit pay dirt, the first
   publicly-funded and second LEED Platinum building in New Mexico.
   Gregory T. Hicks \& Associates P. C. Architects was contracted by UNM to
   design a LEED Silver Certified building for its new COE Administration
   and Classroom Building, Phase 1. All new, state-funded buildings in New
   Mexico must achieve a minimum LEED Silver certification as mandated by
   Governor's Executive Order. Two of our staff, Jim MacGillivray and Jay
   Davis, are LEED APs, and our Principal, Gregory T. Hicks, has taken
   several USGBC courses, but this being our first LEED project, we
   participated in additional study in LEED certification and sustainable
   design. We also hired an experienced sustainable design specialist to
   serve as our LEED AP, our lead prospector, Susan Barnett.
   Not knowing how easy or difficult it might be to achieve LEED Silver,
   the prudent approach was to strive for as many points as possible, so
   that if we lost a few points along the way we would still fulfill the
   obligations of our contract. UNM COE and other UNM staff championed this
   approach. Our initial strategy targeted LEED credits with minimal cost,
   those almost free, logical modifications that improve sustainability.
   Next, we focused on achieving four ``Innovation in Design{''} credits,
   searching for ideas that would involve minor costs or creative design
   endeavor. UNM COE committed to a photovoltaic system for educational and
   research purposes as well as to purchase a renewable energy certificate.
   Our initial venture targeted up to 48 possible points, comfortably
   within Gold territory.
   We submitted our project to USGBC for design review as the project went
   out to bid. The design review denied a few points in some areas, but
   serendipitously awarded a few extra points in other areas. UNM COE
   supported the prospects of achieving Gold so we provided additional
   information to successfully appeal denied credits, which brought us back
   up to a potential of 48 points, assuming targeted points were awarded
   during the construction review. At this point we knew we would certainly
   achieve Silver, possibly Gold.
   Midway through construction, the COE Dean, Richard Howell, and COE Chief
   of Staff, Diane Gwinn, asked us if there might be a way to earn just 4
   or more points to reach the 52 required for LEED Platinum. Steve Chavez,
   UNM Project Manager, strongly championed this effort. This seemed
   difficult, if not impossible at this juncture in the project, but we met
   with COE, UNM engineers, design engineers, LEED AP, and the contractor
   to brainstorm possibilities. We came up with eight possibilities, but
   not all were affordable, practical, or supported, so we whittled the
   eight down to five, but just before the construction review we lost one
   of the five, so we tried for four.
   When the USGBC completed their construction review, we learned we had
   scored 52 points awarded LEED Platinum certification. Partnership of UNM
   COE, architect, engineers, LEED APs, and contractor created this success
   through a relentless ``can-do{''} attitude throughout the project, plus
   some luck. Boring down deeply, we sought Silver and struck Platinum.
   This narrative is organized according to the USGBC LEED credit rating
   system and highlights the sustainable accomplishments of the project

   Initial concerns about an inferior image quality of digital mammography

   mammography to be superior in women with dense breasts, while at the
   same time reducing radiation exposure. Nevertheless, an important
   limitation of digital mammography remains: namely, the fact that
   summation may obscure lesions in dense breast tissue. However, digital
   mammography offers the option of so-called advanced applications, and
   two of these, contrast-enhanced mammography and tomosynthesis, are
   promising candidates for improving the detection of breast lesions
   otherwise obscured by the summation of dense tissue. Two techniques of
   contrast-enhanced mammography are available: temporal subtraction of
   images acquired before and after contrast administration and the
   so-called dual-energy technique, which means that pairs of
   low/high-energy images acquired after contrast administration are
   subtracted. Tomosynthesis on the other hand provides three-dimensional
   information on the breast. The images are acquired with different
   angulations of the X-ray tube while the object or detector is static.
   Various reconstruction algorithms can then be applied to the set of
   typically nine to 28 source images to reconstruct 1-mm slices with a
   reduced risk of obscuring pathology. Combinations of both advanced

   evoke a prominent Fos-expression in the lateral parabrachial nucleus and
   behavioral experiments have demonstrated that this structure is critical
   for the acquisition of conditioned taste aversion. The present study
   examined in rats the relationship between parabrachial neurons activated
   by systemic administration of bacterial cell-wall lipopolysaccharide or
   lithium chloride and the melanocortin system, a major regulator of
   feeding and energy homeostasis that also has been implicated in aversive

   significantly enhance the effect of photodynamic anti-tumor therapy.
   Unfortunately, there is no sufficient information available about the
   impact of those antioxidants on antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy
   (aPDT). The present study is aimed at investigating the antimicrobial
   effect of the dye indocyanine green (ICG) in the presence of Trolox
   (TM), a vitamin E analogue, upon irradiation with near-infrared (NIR)
   laser light (808 nm) on the gramnegative periodontopathogenic bacteria
   Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), Porphyromonas gingivalis
   (P.g.) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.n.).
   Methods: Bacteria solved in PBS were incubated with ICG (50-500 mu g/ml)
   in the presence and absence of Trolox (TM) (2 mM). Irradiation was
   performed after 10 minutes of dark-incubation with NIR-laser-light
   (25-100 J/cm(2), 810 nm). During treatment, temperature was also
   recorded inside the bacterial solutions. The treated suspensions were
   serial diluted and plated onto blood agar plates. After anaerobe
   cultivation for 5 days the colony-forming units (CFU/ml) were
   determined.
   Results: The antibacterial effect was ICG-concentration and exposure
   dependent. It was found that high ICG-concentrations and light fluence
   rates caused bacterial reduction due to hyperthermia. Where low
   ICG-concentrations (<250 mu g/ml) and fluence rates only induced minor
   regression, additional Trolox (TM)-administration significantly enhanced
   the photodynamic effect. While treatment of A. a. (250 mu g/ml ICG, 100
   J/cm(2)) without Trolox (TM) caused no bacterial reduction, additional
   administration led to total eradication. In the presence of Trolox (TM)
   reduction to one-fifth of the original ICG-concentration (50 mu g/ml)
   still induced total suppression of P.g. and F.n. at identical fluence
   (100 J/cm(2)). Treatment with ICG, NIR-light or Trolox (TM) alone showed
   no remarkable bactericidal effect. Application of high
   ICG-concentrations (500 mu g/ml) and exposure values (100 J/cm(2))
   caused peak temperatures of 64.53 degrees C.
   Conclusions: The results clearly show that Trolox (TM) significantly
   enhanced the antibacterial effect of ICG upon irradiation with
   NIR-laser-light. Additional administration of Trolox (TM) may also
   increase the efficiency of other aPDT systems. Lasers Surg. Med.

   impetus with research and demonstration projects, both in Italy and
   other European countries. The main problems with solar PV are the cost
   of solar electricity, which is still higher compared with other
   renewables (such as wind or biomass), due to the cost of
   semi-conductors, and the low conversion efficiency. However, PV panel
   prices are rapidly decreasing benefiting from favorable economies of
   scale. For instance, according to the Energy Information Administration
   (ETA) the US average levelized costs for plants entering service in the
   2018 should be 144.3\$/MW h for solar PV, whereas 111.0\$/MW h for
   biomass and 86.6\$/MW h for wind (Levelized Cost of New Generation
   Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook, 2013). In order to increase the
   electric yield of PV modules (which can be even doubled with respect to
   constant tilt configurations), without significantly increasing the
   system costs, it was decided to consider the addition of inclined
   mirrors at both sides of the PV modules, so as to deflect more solar
   rays towards them, as in Mirror-Augmented Photovoltaic (MAPV) systems.
   The system preserves its constructive simplicity with commercial flat PV
   modules even though dual axis tracker must be implemented, since MAPV
   systems harness mainly the direct radiation. The performance analysis of
   MAPV systems starts from the calculation of the global irradiation on
   the surface of the PV module which is a sum of the direct sunlight on it
   and the irradiation reflected by the mirrors. A mathematical model of a
   MAPV system is presented, which takes into account not only the increase
   of direct (or beam) radiation, due to the mirrors, but also the
   reduction of both the diffuse and reflected radiations due to the
   shadowing effect of the flat mirrors. In particular, under an isotropic
   sky assumption, a simplified analytical expression, applicable in the
   case of MAPV systems, for the sky-view factor has been developed. The
   deterioration in the performance of the PV system as a result of the
   increasing cell temperature with radiation augmentation due to mirrors
   has been also evaluated. Moreover, in order to provide a more realistic
   view of the process, the energy analysis is accompanied by the exergy
   analysis. Finally, in order to analyse the economics of MAPV systems,
   Net Present Value, Discounted Payback Period, Internal Rate of Return
   and Life-Cycle Costs, have been considered and compared with both a
   constant tilt building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system and a

   arresting climate change. Managing climate change is one of the greatest
   challenges humanity has encountered in the 21st century. Responding to
   this greatest challenge, the United Nations has organized numerous
   climate change conferences. Four agreements (United Nations Framework
   Convention on Climate Change {[}UNFCCC], Kyoto, Copenhagen and Doha)
   have emerged in the process of developing a potential international
   climate change policy but failed to produce any ambitious agreement to
   arrest climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach - The pledges made by Conferences of the
   Parties (COPs) to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) are contextualized
   with the ever increasing emissions of GHGs by exploring the databases of
   UNFCCC, International Energy Agency (IEA), Energy Information
   Administration (EIA) and the Netherlands Energy Assessment Agency (NEAA)
   for this study.
   Findings - However, GHGs have continued to rise and no globally binding
   agreement is seen to be forthcoming. Quantified targets to address the
   problem have yet to be agreed while major emitters remain free riders.
   This paper argues that the state-centric negotiating framework and the
   principles of the climate change negotiations were the main reasons for
   the inadequate outcomes leading to the continuing rise in emissions.

   In this study, we used an approach based on activity data to develop a
   consistent series of spatially resolved emissions in the United States
   from 1990 to 2010. The state-level anthropogenic emissions of SO2, NOx,
   CO, NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds), NH3, PM10 and PM2.5
   for a total of 49 sectors were estimated based on several long-term
   databases containing information about activities and emission controls.
   Activity data for energy-related stationary sources were derived from
   the State Energy Data System. Corresponding emission factors reflecting
   implemented emission controls were calculated back from the National
   Emissions Inventory (NEI) for seven years (i.e., 1990, 1995, 1996, 1999,
   2001, 2002 and 2005), and constrained by the AP-42 (US EPA's Compilation
   of Air Pollutant Emissions Factors) dataset. Activity data for mobile
   sources including different types of highway vehicles and non-highway
   equipment were obtained from highway statistics reported by the Federal
   Highway Administration. The trends in emission factors for highway
   mobile source were informed by the 2011 National Transportation
   Statistics. Emissions for all non-energy-related sources were either
   scaled by the growth ratio of activity indicators or adjusted based on
   the NEI trends report.
   Because of the strengthened control efforts, particularly for the power
   sector and mobile sources, emissions of all pollutants except NH3 were
   reduced by half over the last two decades. The emission trends developed
   in this study are comparable with the NEI trend report and EDGAR
   (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) data, but better
   constrained by trends in activity data. Reductions in SO2, NOx, CO and
   EC (speciation of PM2.5 by SMOKE, Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel
   Emissions) emissions agree well with the observed changes in ambient
   SO2, NO2, CO and EC concentrations, suggesting that the various controls
   on emissions implemented over the last two decades are well represented

   sustained during the chronic stages after traumatic spinal cord injury
   (SCI), the objective in the current study was to characterize and
   quantify acute inpatient complications. In addition, the authors sought
   to create a prediction model using clinical variables documented at
   hospital admission to predict acute complication development.
   Methods. Analyses were based on data from the Surgical Timing in Acute
   Spinal Cord Injury Study (STASCIS) data registry, which contains
   prospective information on adult patients with cervical SCIs who were
   enrolled at 6 North American centers over a 7-year period. All patients
   who underwent a standardized American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)
   neurological examination within 24 hours of injury and whose follow-up
   information was available at the acute hospital discharge were included
   in the study. For purposes of classification, complications were divided
   into 5 major categories: 1) cardiopulmonary, 2) surgical, 3) thrombotic,
   4) infectious, and 5) decubitus ulcer development. Univariate
   statistical analyses were performed to determine the relationship
   between complication occurrence and individual demographic, injury, and
   treatment variables. Multivariate logistic regression was subsequently
   performed to create a complication prediction model. Model
   discrimination was judged according to the area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve.
   Results. Complete complication information was available for 411
   patients at the acute care discharge. One hundred sixty patients
   (38.9\%) experienced 240 complications. The mean age among those who
   experienced at least one complication was 45.9 years, as compared with
   43.5 years among those who did not have a complication (p = 0.18). In
   the univariate analysis, patients with complications were less likely to
   receive steroids at admission (p = 0.01), had a greater severity of
   neurological injury as indicated by the ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS)
   grade at presentation (p < 0.01), and a higher frequency of significant
   comorbidity (p = 0.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, a
   severe initial AIS grade (p < 0.01), a high-energy injury mechanism (p =
   0.07), an older age (p = 0.05), the absence of steroid administration (p
   = 0.02), and the presence of comorbid illness (p = 0.02) were associated
   with a greater likelihood of complication development during the period
   of acute hospitalization. The area under the curve value for the full
   model was 0.75, indicating acceptable predictive discrimination.
   Conclusions. These results will help clinicians to identify patients
   with cervical SCIs at greatest risk for complication development and
   thus allowing for the institution of aggressive complication prevention
   measures. (http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2012.4.AOSPINE1246)}","{10.3171/2012.4.AOSPINE1246}","{1547-5654}","{ISI:000307799400010}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   interactions between genetic predisposition and environmental factors.
   Leptin is central to the regulation of energy metabolism and control of
   body weight in mammals.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To better recapitulate the complexity of
   human obesity syndrome, we applied N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)
   mutagenesis in combination with a set of metabolic assays in screening
   mice for obesity. Mapping revealed linkage to the chromosome 6 within a
   region containing mouse Leptin gene. Sequencing on the candidate genes
   identified a novel T-to-A mutation in the third exon of Leptin gene,
   which translates to a V145E amino acid exchange in the leptin
   propeptide. Homozygous Leptin(145E/145E) mutant mice exhibited morbid
   obesity, accompanied by adipose hypertrophy, energy imbalance, and liver
   steatosis. This was further associated with severe insulin resistance,
   hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperleptinemia, characteristics of
   human obesity syndrome. Hypothalamic leptin actions in inhibition of
   orexigenic peptides NPY and AgRP and induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were
   attenuated in Leptin(145E/145E) mice. Administration of exogenous
   wild-type leptin attenuated hyperphagia and body weight increase in
   Leptin(145E/145E) mice. However, mutant V145E leptin
   coimmunoprecipitated with leptin receptor, suggesting that the V145E
   mutation does not affect the binding of leptin to its receptor.
   Molecular modeling predicted that the mutated residue would form
   hydrogen bond with the adjacent residues, potentially affecting the
   structure and formation of an active complex with leptin receptor within
   that region.
   Conclusions/Significance: Thus, our evolutionary, structural, and in
   vivo metabolic information suggests the residue 145 as of special
   function significance. The mouse model harboring leptin V145E mutation
   will provide new information on the current understanding of leptin

   rockfalls is the quantitative prediction of the traveling distance of
   the falling blocks, which is necessary to identify the potentially
   endangered area. This information is also fundamental for the design of
   appropriate defensive works, which are intended to reduce the potential
   impact of the landslide on the population and facilities potentially at
   risk. The design of this type of protective measures typically requires,
   above all, the quantitative prediction of the final travel distance of
   the rock masses. Obtaining a reliable estimate of this quantity is
   complicated by the interaction of the rocks and the slope surface that
   can affect the behavior of the blocks at the impacts. Recently, several
   numerical techniques have been developed and applied to this purpose,
   based on the solution of the Newton's equations of motion for each
   block. The aim of this work is to compare the performance of two such
   approaches, namely the Colorado Rockfall Simulation Program (CRSP), and
   the Discrete Element Method (DEM). the CRSP method can describe the
   falling motion of blocks of cylindrical, spherical or discoidal shape,
   which translate and rotate in the vertical plane of motion. The motion
   of the block is determined by means of the parabolic equation of
   free-fall motion and the balance of total energy equation. The impact
   with the slope surface is modeled taking into account the block shape
   and size and the slope roughness. Upon impact with the slope surface,
   the normal and tangential components of the block velocity are reduced
   by means of suitable coefficients of restitution, K(n) and K(t), in the
   normal and tangential directions, respectively, to take into account the
   dissipation of energy due to inelastic deformations. The model is
   capable of considering the combination of free-fall, rebound, rolling
   and sliding motion that can occur for different slope roughness and
   block size. An alternative to the CRSP method, which appears
   particularly promising for its versatility, is represented by the DEM.
   In the DEM, the motion of the falling block under the action of gravity
   is computed by numerically solving Newton's equation of motion. In this
   work, the DEM code UDEC (Itasca, 1991) has been used to simulate the
   falling block and to model its fragmentation during rhe fall. In UDEC,
   each distinct element is a prismatic block that can be considered
   perfectly rigid or deformable. Each block in the model is subject to
   body forces (gravity) and contact forces exchanged at the contacts with
   other blocks or with rigid ``walls{''}. These two approaches have been
   used to simulate a real case study occurred in a rock slope located in
   central Italy where several rockfall events occurred and were recorded
   by in-situ surveys from the local administration. The results of the
   study indicate that when an appropriate calibration of the physical
   parameters is carried out the different approaches can correctly
   reproduce the observed phenomena. The performance of the different
   approaches to rockfall simulation - the CRSP method and the Discrete
   Element Method, in the particular implementation of the UDEC code - with
   reference to observations from a real rock slope lead to two main
   conclusions. As far as the falling of a single block is concerned, both
   methods give comparable results that are in line with the available
   observations.
   However, while in the CRSP method a single set of restitution
   coefficients is sufficient to characterize the block behavior upon
   impact, the local damping coeffcient introduced in UDEC to model the
   energy dissipation upon impact must be varied with block size, in order
   to model correctly the effect of block size on the observed traveling
   distance. On the other hand, a unique advantage of the DEM approach as
   compared to other methods derived from the lumped mass approach is the
   possibility of modeling the effects of rock fragmentation. The results
   of the simulations indicate that the position and the extension of the
   accumulation zone can be strongly affected by block fragmentation; in
   particular the traveling distance tends to decrease progressively with
   block fragmentation. Therefore, this particular aspect should be taken
   into proper consideration in the rockfall hazard evaluation whenever the
   possibility of block fragmentation is of concern.}",NA,NA,"{ISI:000290045002115}","{Tamagnini, Claudio/L-9350-2015

   systems constitute a physically coupled system. While these systems have
   always been heavily impacted by coastal storms, increases in population
   density, infrastructure, and personal and business merchandise have
   exacerbated the economic and personal impacts of these events over the
   past half century. As such there has been increased focus on the need
   for more timely and accurate forecasts of impending events.
   Traditionally model forecast architectures for coastal storm surge,
   flooding and inundation of coastal and inland areas have taken the
   approach of dealing with each system separately: rivers, estuaries,
   harbors and offshore facing areas. However, given advances in coupled
   modeling and the availability of real-time data, the ability to
   accurately predict and project coastal, estuary and inland flooding
   related to the passage of high energy and wet atmospheric events is
   rapidly emerging and requires a new paradigm in system architecture. No
   longer do monthly averaged winds or river discharge or water levels have
   to be invoked in developing hindcasts for planning purposes or for
   real-time forecasts. In 1999 a hurricane associated flood on the North
   Carolina coast took 56 lives and caused more than \$6 billion in
   economic impacts. None of the models existing at that time were able to
   properly forecast the massive flooding and clearly called for a new
   model paradigm.
   Here we propose a model system that couples atmospheric information to
   fully three dimensional, non-linear time dependent ocean basin, coastal
   and estuary hydrodynamic models coupled to interactive river models with
   input of real or modeled winds, observed or modeled precipitation,
   measured and modeled water levels, and streamflow. The river and
   estuarine components must both be capable of going into modes of storage
   or accelerated discharge. Spatial scales must downscale in the
   horizontal from thousands to tens meters and in the vertical from
   hundreds to several centimeters. Topography and elevation data should be
   of the highest resolution available, necessary for highly accurate
   predictions of the timing and location of the inundation and retreat of
   flood waters. Precipitation information must be derived from the optimal
   mix of direct radar, satellite and ground-based observations. Creating
   the capability described above will advance the modernization of
   hydrologic services provided by the National Oceanic \& Atmospheric
   Administration and provide more accurate and timely forecasts and
   climatologies of coastal and estuary flooding. The goal of these
   climatologies and improved forecasts is to provide better information to
   local and regional planners, emergency managers, highway patrols and to
   improve the capacity of coastal communities to mitigate against the
   impacts of coastal flooding.}",NA,"{0025-3324}","{ISI:000244970400010}","{Kelleher, Kevin/L-6520-2015}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   gland is regulated by the interplay of at least two hypothalamic
   hormones, GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin, via their
   engagement with specific cell surface receptors on the anterior
   pituitary somatotroph. Furthermore, release of GH in vivo may also be
   controlled by a third type of receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue
   receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, called GHS receptor type 1a
   (GHS-R1a), which was identified in the pituitary and the hypothalamus in
   humans using a nonpeptidyl growth hormone secretagogue (MK-0677).
   Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand for the GHS-R1a, is a 28-amino-acid
   peptide isolated from human stomach that is modified by a straight chain
   octanoyl group covalently linked to Sera, which is essential for its
   endocrine activity. This hormone, predominantly expressed and secreted
   by the stomach, has a dual action on GH secretion and food intake,
   showing interdependency between these actions. The finding that fasting
   and food intake, respectively, increase and decrease the secretion of
   ghrelin suggests that this hormone may be the bridge connecting somatic
   growth and body composition with energy metabolism, and appears to play
   a role in the alteration of energy homeostasis and body weight in
   pathophysiological states such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
   Despite this, little is known about the intracellular signaling through
   which ghrelin exerts its regulatory actions. Activation of intracellular
   calcium mobilization is one of the earliest known cellular signals
   elicited by ghrelin. In HEK-293 cells expressing the GHS-R1a, ghrelin
   induces a biphasic cytosolic calcium elevation characterized by a spike
   phase of the response, which reflects Ins(1,4,5)P-3-dependent calcium
   mobilization of intracellular stores, and a sustained phase of the
   response, which is due to calcium influx across the plasma membrane
   triggered by aperture of capacitative calcium channels (store-operated
   calcium channels). Upon repeated administration, ghrelin showed a marked
   suppression of ghrelin-mediated elevations of intracellular calcium.
   This homologous desensitization represents an important physiological
   mechanism that modulates receptor responsiveness and acts as an
   information filter for intracellular signaling system. The discovery of
   ghrelin adds a new component to the complex machinery responsible for
   regulation of GH secretion in connection with the regulation of appetite
   and energy homeostasis.}","{10.1385/ENDO:22:1:5}","{0969-711X}","{ISI:000186314900002}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   has funded the development and installation of five ground-based
   atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI) systems at the
   Southern Great Plains (SGP) site. The purpose of this paper is to
   provide an overview of the AERI instrument, improvement of the AERI
   temperature and moisture retrieval technique, new profiling utility, and
   validation of high-temporal-resolution AERI-derived stability indices
   important for convective nowcasting. AERI systems have been built at the
   University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, and deployed in the
   Oklahoma-Kansas area collocated with National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration 404-MHz wind profilers at Lamont, Vici, Purcell, and
   Morris, Oklahoma, and Hillsboro, Kansas. The AERI systems produce
   absolutely calibrated atmospheric infrared emitted radiances at
   one-wavenumber resolution from 3 to 20 mum at less than 10-min temporal
   resolution. The instruments are robust, are automated in the field, and
   are monitored via the Internet in near-real time. The infrared radiances
   measured by the AERI systems contain meteorological information about
   the vertical structure of temperature and water vapor in the planetary
   boundary layer (PBL; 0-3 km). A mature temperature and water vapor
   retrieval algorithm has been developed over a 10-yr period that provides
   vertical profiles at less than 10-min temporal resolution to 3 km in the
   PBL. A statistical retrieval is combined with the hourly Geostationary
   Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sounder water vapor or Rapid
   Update Cycle, version 2, numerical weather prediction (NWP) model
   profiles to provide a nominal hybrid first guess of temperature and
   moisture to the AERI physical retrieval algorithm. The hourly satellite
   or NWP data provide a best estimate of the atmospheric state in the
   upper PBL; the AERI radiances provide the mesoscale temperature and
   moisture profile correction in the PBL to the large-scale GOES and NWP
   model profiles at high temporal resolution. The retrieval product has
   been named AERIplus because the first guess used for the mathematical
   physical inversion uses an optimal combination of statistical
   climatological, satellite, and numerical model data to provide a best
   estimate of the atmospheric state. The AERI physical retrieval algorithm
   adjusts the boundary layer temperature and moisture structure provided
   by the hybrid first guess to fit the observed AERI downwelling radiance
   measurement. This provides a calculated AERI temperature and moisture
   profile using AERI-observed radiances ``plus{''} the best-known
   atmospheric state above the boundary layer using NWP or satellite data.
   AERIplus retrieval accuracy for temperature has been determined to be
   better than 1 K, and water vapor retrieval accuracy is approximately 5\%
   in absolute water vapor when compared with well-calibrated radiosondes
   from the surface to an altitude of 3 km. Because AERI can monitor the
   thermodynamics where the atmosphere usually changes most rapidly,
   atmospheric stability tendency information is readily available from the
   system. High-temporal-resolution retrieval of convective available
   potential energy, convective inhibition, and PBL equivalent potential
   temperature theta(e) are provided in near-real time from all five AERI
   systems at the ARM SGP site, offering a unique look at the atmospheric
   state. This new source of meteorological data has shown excellent skill
   in detecting rapid synoptic and mesoscale meteorological changes within
   clear atmospheric conditions.
   This method has utility in nowcasting temperature inversion strength and
   destabilization caused by theta(e) advection. This
   high-temporal-resolution monitoring of rapid atmospheric destabilization
   is especially important for nowcasting severe convection.}","{10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<0584:NPOTMA>2.0.CO;2}","{0894-8763}","{ISI:000182452200003}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   production at 147.8 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Cumulative CBM production
   is close to 0.9 trillion cubic feet (Tcf). The Black Warrior Basin of
   Alabama in the southern Appalachian basin (including a very minor amount
   from the Cahaba coal field) accounts for about 75\% of this annual
   production and about 75\% of the wells, and the remainder comes from the
   central and northern Appalachian basin. The Southwest Virginia coal
   field accounts for about 95\% of the production from the central and
   northern parts of the Appalachian basin. Production data and trends
   imply that several of the Appalachian basin states, except for Alabama
   and Virginia, are in their infancy with respect to CBM development.
   Total in-place CBM resources in the central and northern Appalachian
   basin have been variously estimated at 66 to 76 trillion cubic feet
   (Tcf), of which an estimated 14.55 Tcf (similar to 20\%) is technically
   recoverable according to a 1995 U.S. Geological Survey assessment. For

   are essential in making well-informed transportation planning decisions.
   In addition, detection of real-time traffic conditions is a key element
   in advanced traffic management and traveler information systems. Until
   the last decade,inductive loop detectors; pneumatic road tubes, and
   temporary manual counts were the primary methods for collecting both
   real-time and historical traffic data. However, technological
   innovations have given rise to design many different types of advanced
   traffic detectors. Recently developed traffic detectors use sonic,
   ultrasonic, microwave, or infrared energy. Most of these detectors can
   be mounted overhead or to the side of traffic lanes. Magnetic sensors
   are now being built in sizes small enough to be placed in conduits under
   the roadway. Artificial intelligence algorithms can process videotaped
   images of road scenes and output many useful traffic parameters.
   Even though nonintrusive technologies have been available for several
   years, there are still many uncertainties regarding their use. Traffic
   engineers lack a comprehensive comparison of the various types of
   traffic detection technology A study conducted by the Minnesota
   Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) and SRF Consulting Group, Inc.
   (SRF) and sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) seeks
   to address this need.
   Mn/DOT and SRF undertook a two-year effort to test a wide variety of

   three lanes of Interstate 394 in Minneapolis at the Penn Avenue
   interchange. Phase Ii, which ran from February to November 1996,
   consisted of an all-season monitoring of the devices' performance and
   maintenance requirements and involved both freeway and intersection

   vertical structure and important horizontal scales of the baroclinic
   transients. Attention is focused on the eight Northern Hemisphere
   winters of 1985/86-1992/93 and on (bandpass) transients of timescales
   2-8 days.
   The local seasonal mean vertical shear (normalized by the square root of
   the static stability) is very similar between the two sets of analyses.
   The upper-level vorticity gradient (dominated by the meridional
   derivative) also shows little sensitivity to which reanalysis is used.
   The condition for barotropic instability (change of sign of total
   vorticity gradient) is satisfied.
   The vertical structure of bandpass kinetic energy, meridional sensible
   heat Bur, and variance of temperature gradient all show consistent
   differences between the NCEP and NASA reanalyses, with the NCEP signal
   significantly stronger at upper levels. The difference is modest for the
   kinetic energy (similar to 10\%) and is much stronger for the heat flux
   (similar to 100\%) and the variance of temperature gradient (similar to
   70\%). The NCEP reanalyses also have a stronger midlevel temperature
   gradient variance by about 20\%. The differences in this quantity
   reflect the treatment of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
   Information Service (NESDIS) operational retrievals used by both
   reanalyses, and these satellite data affect the NASA reanalyses more
   strongly.
   There are significant differences in the synoptic waves. The positive
   difference between the 300-hPa bandpass kinetic energy (NCEP minus NASA)
   as a function of the global wave number used to truncate the fields
   reaches nearly half (two-thirds) its total value by wavenumber 15 in the
   eastern Pacific (Atlantic). For the 200-hPa sensible heat flux the
   difference is a maximum at wavenumber 10 over the whole midlatitude
   belt.
   Differences in midlevel temperature gradient variance between the first
   three winters (using NESDIS statistical retrievals) and the last five
   winters (using NESDIS physically based retrievals) include (i) NASA

   The performance of many pharmaceutical manufacturing processes and the

   Objective: The objective was to summarize the effects of initiation of
   lipids within the first 2 d of life and the effects of different lipid
   compositions on growth and morbidities in VLBW infants.
   Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis of publications identified
   in a search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was undertaken.
   Randomized controlled studies were eligible if information on growth was

   Results: The search yielded 14 studies. No differences were observed in

   Global warming is attracting attention from policy makers due to its
   impacts such as floods, extreme weather, increases in temperature by 0.7
   degrees C, heat waves, storms, etc. These disasters result in loss of
   human life and billions of dollars in property. Global warming is
   believed to be caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases due to human
   activities including the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from
   petroleum consumption. Limitations of the previous methods of predicting
   CO2 emissions and lack of work on the prediction of the Organization of
   the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) CO2 emissions from petroleum
   consumption have motivated this research.
   Methods/Findings
   The OPEC CO2 emissions data were collected from the Energy Information
   Administration. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) adaptability and
   performance motivated its choice for this study. To improve
   effectiveness of the ANN, the cuckoo search algorithm was hybridised
   with accelerated particle swarm optimisation for training the ANN to
   build a model for the prediction of OPEC CO2 emissions. The proposed
   model predicts OPEC CO2 emissions for 3, 6, 9, 12 and 16 years with an
   improved accuracy and speed over the state-of-the-art methods.
   Conclusion
   An accurate prediction of OPEC CO2 emissions can serve as a reference
   point for propagating the reorganisation of economic development in OPEC
   member countries with the view of reducing CO2 emissions to Kyoto
   benchmarks-hence, reducing global warming. The policy implications are

   stool was performed at baseline and at week 8. The study was registered
   at the Clinical Research Information Service, approved by the Korea
   National Institute of Health (KCT0000386).
   Results: Although both groups showed a significant reduction in weight
   and waist circumference (p = 0.000), no significant differences in body
   composition and metabolic markers were observed. In correlation
   analysis, change in body composition showed positive correlation with
   endotoxin level (r = 0.441, p < 0.05 for BW; and r = 0.350, p < 0.05 for
   fat mass) and the population of gut Lactobacillus plantarum (r = 0.425,
   p < 0.05 for BW; and r = 0.407, p < 0.05 for BMI). The Gram negative
   bacterial population in gut also exhibited positive correlation with
   changes in body composition (WC) and total cholesterol level (r = 0.359,
   and 0.393, for the former and later parameters, respectively, p < 0.05
   for both). While, the profile of gut Bifidobacterium breve population
   showed negative correlation with endotoxin level (r = 0.350, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Correlations between gut microbiota and change in body
   composition indicate that probiotics may influence energy metabolism in
   obesity. Correlation between endotoxin level and weight reduction
   indicates that probiotics may play an important role in prevention of
   endotoxin production, which can lead to gut microbiota dysbiosis
   associated with obesity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for

   Early neonatal hyperglycemia is common among very lowbirthweight (VLBW)
   neonates. Increased risks for death and major morbidities have been
   observed among VLBW neonates who develop hyperglycemia. It is uncertain
   whether the hyperglycemia per se is a cause of adverse clinical outcomes
   or whether the incidence of adverse outcomes can be reduced by
   treatment.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects on clinical outcomes of interventions for treating
   neonatal hyperglycemia in the VLBW neonate receiving total or partial
   parenteral nutrition.
   Search strategy
   We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,
   The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 of 12, 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to April
   2011), EMBASE (1980 to April 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to July 2008). We
   searched for abstracts submitted for the annual meetings of Pediatric
   Academic Societies 2000 to 2011 and The European Society for Pediatric
   Research 2005 to 2010.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized or quasi-randomized trials of interventions for the treatment
   of hyperglycemia in hyperglycemic VLBW neonates were eligible for
   inclusion in this review.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected studies for eligibility and
   extracted data on study design, methodology, clinical features, and
   treatment outcomes. Additional information on study design and outcomes
   was obtained from the lead investigator of each of the two included
   trials. The included trials were assessed for blinding of randomization,
   blinding of caretakers to the intervention, completeness of follow-up,
   and blinding of outcome measurement. The treatment effect measures for
   categorical outcomes were relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD)
   with their 95\% confidence intervals (CI); for continuous outcomes the
   measure was mean difference and 95\% CI.
   Main results
   Only two eligible trials were found (Collins 1991; Meetze 1998). Both
   were randomized but of very small size (24 and 23 neonates randomized in
   each trial, respectively).
   No trial compared reduction versus no reduction of glucose infusion.
   Collins 1991 compared insulin infusion with standard care. Insulin
   infusion had no significant effect on death or bacterial sepsis; effects
   on other major morbidities were not assessed. Insulin infusion resulted
   in significant increases in non-protein energy intake, glucose intake,
   and short-term weight gain.
   Meetze 1998 compared insulin infusion with reduction of glucose
   infusion. Insulin infusion had no significant effects on death, severe
   intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bacterial
   sepsis, fungal sepsis, or necrotizing enterocolitis; effects on other
   major morbidities were not assessed. Insulin infusion resulted in
   significant increases in glucose intake and total energy intake.
   Authors' conclusions
   Evidence from randomized trials in hyperglycemic VLBW neonates is
   insufficient to determine the effects of treatment on death or major
   morbidities. It remains uncertain whether the hyperglycemia per se is a
   cause of adverse clinical outcomes or how the hyperglycemia should be
   treated. Much larger randomized trials in hyperglycemic VLBW neonates
   that are powered on clinical outcomes are needed in order to determine
   whether, and how, the hyperglycemia should be treated.}","{10.1002/14651858.CD007453.pub3}","{1469-493X}","{ISI:000295674300040}",NA,NA,"{CD007453}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   a multi-functional neuroactive steroid that has been implicated in a
   variety of biological effects in both the periphery and central nervous
   system. Mechanistic studies of DHEA in the periphery have emphasized its
   role as a prohormone and those in the brain have focused on effects
   exerted at cell surface receptors. Recent results demonstrated that DHEA
   is intrinsically androgenic. It competes with DHT for binding to
   androgen receptor (AR), induces AR-regulated reporter gene expression in
   vitro, and exogenous DHEA administration regulates gene expression in
   peripheral androgen-dependent tissues and LnCAP prostate cancer cells,
   indicating genomic effects and adding a level of complexity to
   functional models. The absence of information about the effect of DHEA
   on gene expression in the CNS is a significant gap in light of
   continuing clinical interest in the compound as a hormone replacement
   therapy in older individuals, patients with adrenal insufficiency, and
   as a treatment that improves sense of well-being, increases libido,
   relieves depressive symptoms, and serves as a neuroprotective agent. In
   the present study, ovariectomized CF-1 female mice, an established model
   for assessing CNS effects of androgens, were treated with DHEA (1
   mg/day), dihydrotestosterone (DHT, a potent androgen used as a positive
   control; 0.1 mg/day) or vehicle (negative control) for 7 days. The
   effects of DHEA on gene expression were assessed in two regions of the
   CNS that are enriched in AR, hypothalamus and hippocampus, using DNA
   microarray, real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. RIA of serum
   samples assessed treatment effects on circulating levels of major
   steroids. In hypothalamus, DHEA and DHT significantly up-regulated the
   gene expression of hypocretin (Hcrt; also called orexin),
   pro-melanin-concentrating hormone (Pmch), and protein kinase C delta
   (Prkcd), and down-regulated the expression of deleted in bladder cancer
   chromosome region candidate I (Dbccr1) and chitinase 3-like 3 (Chi313).
   Two-step real-time RT-PCR confirmed changes in the expression of three
   genes (Pmch, Hcrt and Prkcd) using the same RNA sample employed in the
   microarray experiment. Immunohistochemistry showed augmentation of
   prepto-hypocretin (pHcrt) neuropeptide protein expression by DHEA and
   DHT in hypothalamus, consistent with the localization of orexin neurons.
   In hippocampus, DHT down-regulated the expression of Prkcd, while DHEA
   did not have significant effects. RIA results supported the view that
   DHEA-induced effects were mediated through AR. The current study
   identified neurogenomic effects of DHEA treatment on a subset of genes
   directly implicated in the regulation of appetite, energy utilization,
   alertness, apoptosis, and cell survival. These changes in gene
   expression in the CNS represent a constellation of effects that may help
   explain the diverse benefits attributed to replacement therapy with
   DHEA. The data also provide a new level of detail regarding the genomic
   mechanism of action of DHEA in the CNS and strongly support a central
   role for the androgen receptor in the production of these effects. More
   broadly, the results may be clinically significant because they provide
   new insights into processes that appear to mediate the diverse CNS
   effects attributed to DHEA. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}","{10.1016/j.jsbmb.2009.01.015}","{0960-0760}","{ISI:000265503100003}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   The principal causes of systematic errors in the current National

   optical thickness retrieval algorithm have been identified and can be
   reduced significantly, if the correction and adjustment suggested from
   the global validation are adopted. Random error in the tau retrieval is
   identified to be a major source of error on deriving the effective
   Angstromngstrom wavelength exponent alpha and may be associated with
   regional differences in aerosol particles, which are not accounted for
   in the current second-generation operational algorithm. Adjustments to
   the nonaerosol and aerosol radiative transfer model parameters that
   reduce systematic errors in tau retrievals are suggested for
   consideration in the next-generation algorithm. Basic features that
   should be included in the next-generation algorithm to reduce random
   error in tau retrievals and the resulting error in the effective

   the retrieval algorithm, the biases in both channels of AVHRR and VIRS
   are reduced significantly to values close to zero, although random error
   is almost unchanged. The alpha exponent derived directly from the
   aerosol optical thicknesses (taus) has been shown to be poorly

   system physiologic function in hyperexcitable brain manifested by
   abnormal energy metabolism, lowered threshold for phosphene generation,
   and increased contingent negative variation. Human functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and magnetoencepholography data strongly suggest that
   aura is caused by cortical spreading depression.
   REVIEW SUMMARY- Brain hyperexcitability may be caused by low magnesium
   levels, mitochandrial abnormalities with abnormal phosphorylation of
   adenosine 5'-diphosphate, a dysfunction related to nitric oxide, or
   calcium channelopathy. Low magnesium can result in opening of calcium
   channels, increased intracellular calcium, glutamate release, and
   increased extracellular potassium, which may in turn trigger cortical
   spreading depression. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been suggested by a
   low phosphocreatine:Pi ratio and a possible response by migraine
   patients to riboflavin prophylaxis. Nitroglycerine administration
   results in a delayed migraine-like headache in migraine patients but not
   iii control patients; and a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor
   aborted migraine at 2 hours in the majority of tested migraine patients
   compared to controls. Many patients with familial hemiplegic migraine
   have a missense mutation in the P/Q calcium channel, so that this form
   of migraine, at feast, is associated with a demonstrable calcium
   channelopathy.
   CONCLUSIONS- The generation of migraine occurs centrally in the brain
   stem, sometimes preceded by cortical spreading depression and aura.
   Activation of the trigeminovascular system stimulates perivascular
   trigeminal sensory afferent nerves with release of vasoactive
   neuropeptides, resulting in vasodilation and transduction of central

   central second- and third-order neurons and activation of brain stem
   autonomic nuclei to induce associated symptoms.}","{10.1097/00127893-200109000-00002}","{1074-7931}","{ISI:000171415900002}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   study, experiments were done in Sprague Dawley rats initially to provide
   a detailed mapping within the NTS complex of cells containing
   immunoreactivity to the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb). In a
   second series, this NTS region containing Ob-Rb immunoreactive cells was
   explored for single units antidromically activated by stimulation of

   antidromically identified neurons were then tested for their response to
   intra-carotid injections of leptin (50-100 ng/0.1ml), and to activation
   of peripheral chemoreceptors following an injection of potassium cyanide
   (KCN) (80 mu g/0.1ml) into the carotid artery. Cells containing
   Ob-Rb-like immunoreactivity were found predominantly in the caudal NTS:
   within the medial, commissural and gelatinous (sub-postremal area)
   subnuclei of the NTS complex. Of 73 single units tested in these NTS
   regions, 48 were antidromically activated by stimulation of RVLM pressor
   sites and 25 of these single units responded with an increase in

   underground coal mining continues to be one of the most dangerous
   occupations in the country. In addition, there are large variations in
   both profitability and the incidence of occupational injuries across
   mines.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the association
   between profitability and the incidence rate of occupational injuries in
   U.S. underground coal mines between 1992 and 2008.
   Data and method: We used mine-specific data on annual hours worked,
   geographic location, and the number of occupational injuries suffered
   annually from the employment and accident/injury databases of the Mine
   Safety and Health Administration, and mine-specific data on annual
   revenue from coal sales, mine age, workforce union status, and mining
   method from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A total of 5669
   mine-year observations (number of mines x number of years) were included
   in our analysis. We used a negative binomial random effects model that
   was appropriate for analyzing panel (combined time-series and
   cross-sectional) injury data that were non-negative and discrete. The
   dependent variable, occupational injury, was measured in three different
   and non-mutually exclusive ways: all reported fatal and nonfatal
   injuries, reported nonfatal injuries with lost workdays, and the `most
   serious' (i.e. sum of fatal and serious nonfatal) injuries reported. The
   total number of hours worked in each mine and year examined was used as
   an exposure variable. Profitability, the main explanatory variable, was
   approximated by revenue per hour worked. Our model included mine age,
   workforce union status, mining method, and geographic location as
   additional control variables.
   Results: After controlling for other variables, a 10\% increase in real
   total revenue per hour worked was associated with 0.9\%, 1.1\%. and
   1.6\% decrease, respectively, in the incidence rates of all reported
   injuries, reported injuries with lost workdays, and the most serious
   injuries reported.
   Conclusion: We found an inverse relationship between profitability and
   each of the three indicators of occupational injuries we used. These
   results might be partially due to factors that affect both profitability
   and safety, such as management or engineering practices, and partially
   due to lower investments in safety by less profitable mines, which could
   imply that some financially stressed mines might be so focused on
   survival that they forgo investing in safety. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}","{10.1016/j.aap.2012.07.002}","{0001-4575}","{ISI:000314191600089}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

   network with centralized administration, it may not be realistic in

   percentage of accuracy, the academic performance of the candidates to
   study a university career, a study that discovers other coefficients in
   a lot of the analyzed variables: teacher performance and the burnout
   syndrome
   The Burnout Syndrome describes physical and psychological states of the
   individual, characterized by decreased energy, focus and motivation,
   among others. This symptom is a major cause of absence from work and, in
   some cases, school dropout. It has also been considered as a variable
   that could cause poor teaching performance or poor academic
   accomplishment {[}1].
   The Burnout affects people who work with and for other people, for
   example teachers, students, doctors, nurses, psychologists, etc., no age
   or gender discrimination. Teachers and college students are constantly
   under situations that may cause the syndrome to manifest itself.
   Holding the hypothesis that burnout syndrome affects academic
   performance among the university professors by influencing teacher
   performance, in this investigation was determined, by the mathematical
   method of linear regression, the relationship between teachers burnout
   syndrome in the School of Computer Science in Mazatlan City (FIMAZ) of

   Information was collected using a specialized instrument to measure the
   presence of burnout syndrome (Maslash Scale) between teachers.
   Among the most relevant results stands out that teachers with a
   seniority of 15 years or more, have better rates of teacher performance
   (85\% or more) and low levels of exhaustion (burnout), while teachers
   with 14 years of teaching experience, obtained an approval of students
   less than 85\% and high levels of exhaustion (burnout).
   It is important to note that, overall, 20\% of the teachers surveyed
   presented high rates of burnout and 36\% average levels of the syndrome.
   It can be concluded that the burnout syndrome impacts on younger
   teachers with less seniority, thus affecting their teaching performance.

   endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) receptor
   (GHS-R). Ghrelin also acts as an orexigenic factor and regulates energy
   balance in rodents. In goldfish, native ghrelin consists of 11 molecular
   variants, the major form being a 17-residue peptide with n-octanoic acid
   modification (n-octanoyl ghrelin17), and intraperitoneal (IP)
   administration of n-octanoyl ghrelin17 induces central actions such as
   stimulation of food intake and suppression of locomotor activity through
   capsaicin-sensitive afferents. Four types of GHS-Rs (1a-1, 1a-2, 2a-1
   and 2a-2) have been identified in goldfish, and one GHS, GHRP-6, can
   activate only GHS-R2a-1 in vitro. However, there is no information about
   the effect of GHRP-6 on food intake and locomotor activity in goldfish
   in vivo. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether
   IP-administered GHRP-6 would mimic the orexigenic action of n-octanoyl
   ghrelin17 and its suppression of locomotor activity. IP administration
   of GHRP-6 at 1 pmol/g body weight (SW) stimulated food intake, and was
   equipotent to the orexigenic action of n-octanoyl ghrelin17 at 10 pmol/g
   BW. IP-injected GHRP-6 at 1 pmol/g BW also induced a significant
   decrease of locomotor activity, as was the case for IP-injected
   n-octanoyl ghrelin17 at 10 pmol/g BW. The action of GHRP-6 was blocked
   by IP-preinjected capsaicin at 160 nmol/g BW. These results suggest that
   the central action of GHRP-6 might be mediated via the
   GHS-R2a-1-signaling pathway, and subsequently through
   capsaicin-sensitive afferents in goldfish. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

   weather-scale variability over the whole globe with reasonable accuracy
   have only become possible with the advent of extensive global, mostly
   satellite, data sets within the past couple of decades. The accuracy of
   these fluxes, estimated to be about 10-15 W/m(2), is largely limited by
   the accuracy of the input data sets. The leading uncertainties in the
   surface fluxes are no longer predominantly induced by clouds but are now
   as much associated with uncertainties in the surface and near-surface
   atmospheric properties. This study presents a fuller, more quantitative
   evaluation of the uncertainties for the surface albedo and emissivity
   and surface skin temperatures by comparing the main available global
   data sets from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   product, the NASA Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Surface
   Radiation Budget project, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction, the International
   Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the Laboratoire de
   Meteorologie Dynamique, NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Advanced Very High
   Resolution Radiometer project, and the NOAA Optimum Interpolation Sea
   Surface Temperature Analysis and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
   (TRMM) Microwave Image project. The data sets are, in practice, treated
   as an ensemble of realizations of the actual climate such that their
   differences represent an estimate of the uncertainty in their
   measurements because we do not possess global ``truth'' data sets for
   these quantities. The results are globally representative and may be
   taken as a generalization of our previous ISCCP-based uncertainty
   estimates for the input data sets. Surface properties have the primary
   role in determining the surface upward shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW)
   flux. From this study the following conclusions are obtained. Although
   land surface albedos in the near-infrared remain poorly constrained
   (highly uncertain), they do not cause too much error in total surface SW
   fluxes; the more subtle regional and seasonal variations associated with
   vegetation and snow are still in doubt. The uncertainty of the broadband
   black-sky SW albedo for land surface from this study is about 7\%, which
   can easily induce 5-10 W/m(2) uncertainty in (upwelling) surface SW flux
   estimates. Even though available surface (broadband) LW emissivity data
   sets differ significantly (3-5\% uncertainty), this disagreement is
   confined to wavelengths > 20 mu m so that there is little practical
   effect (1-3 W/m(2)) on the surface upwelling LW fluxes. The surface skin
   temperature is one of two leading factors that cause problems with
   surface LW fluxes. Even though the differences among the various data
   sets are generally only 2-4 K, this can easily cause 10-15 W/m(2)
   uncertainty in calculated surface (upwelling) LW fluxes. Significant
   improvements could be obtained for surface LW flux calculations by
   improving the retrievals of (in order of decreasing importance): (1)
   surface skin temperature, (2) surface air and near-surface-layer
   temperature, (3) column precipitable water amount, and 4) broadband
   emissivity.
   In addition, for surface SW fluxes, improvements could be obtained
   (excluding improved cloud treatment) by improving the retrievals of (1)
   aerosols (from our sensitivity studies but not discussed in this work)
   and (2) surface (black-sky) albedo, of which the NIR part of the
   spectrum has mch larger uncertainty.}","{10.1029/2005JD007008}","{2169-897X}","{ISI:000243530100001}","{Rossow, William/F-3138-2015}",NA,"{D01102}","{2169-8996}",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
