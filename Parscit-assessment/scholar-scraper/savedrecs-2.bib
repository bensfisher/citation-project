Abstract = {{We estimate trends and racial differentials in marriage, cohabitation,
   union formation and dissolution (union regimes) for the period 1970-2002

   application of multistate life table analysis to pooled survey data. Our
   analysis demonstrates (1) a dramatic increase in the lifetime
   proportions of transitions from never-married, divorced or widowed to
   cohabiting; (2) a substantial decrease in the stability of cohabiting
   unions; (3) a dramatic increase in mean ages at cohabiting after divorce
   and widowhood; (4) a substantial decrease in direct transition from
   never-married to married; (5) a significant decrease in the overall
   lifetime proportion of ever marrying and re-marrying in the 1970s to
   1980s but a relatively stable pattern in the 1990s to 2000-2002; and (6)
   a substantial decrease in the lifetime proportion of transition from

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the year 2006, Australia introduced graphic cigarette
   packet warnings. Previous warnings were text only. New warnings include
   one of 14 pictures, many depicting tobacco-related pathology. Methods:
   This study monitored the roll-out of the health policy initiative using
   multiple methodologies. Print media coverage of new pack warnings was
   observed over 3 years. Story content was coded as positive (supportive
   of pack warnings), neutral or negative. An observational study of small
   random sample of metropolitan stores (n = 16) over 7 months measured the
   pace of the roll-out in shops. Once new packs were readily available in
   stores, smokers (n = 152) were intercepted in city streets and asked
   about their reactions. Results: Of the 67 media stories, 85\% were
   positive or neutral about the new warnings and 15\% were negative.
   Supportive content presented health benefits. Unsupportive content
   presented industry arguments. After the legislative change, it took 2
   months before any new packs appeared in stores. After 6 months, the
   majority carried them. Newest images had highest recall among smokers.
   About 60\% said new warnings detracted from the look of their brand.
   About 51\% felt the increased risk of dying from smoking-related
   illness. About 38\% felt motivated to quit. Conclusion: Plans by
   government to introduce graphic warnings were delayed up to 2 years,
   apparently by heavy industry lobbying. Actual widespread appearance in
   shops occurred several months after the implementation date. While media
   coverage of the new warnings reported the industry arguments against
   them, the balance of coverage was overwhelmingly positive. Smokers'
   initial reactions were in line with tobacco control objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To examine the impact of health warnings on smokers by
   comparing the short-term impact of new graphic (2006) Australian
   warnings with: (i) earlier (2003) United Kingdom larger text-based
   warnings; (ii) and Canadian graphic warnings (late 2000); and also to
   extend our understanding of warning wear-out.
   Methods: The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Survey (ITC
   Project) follows prospective cohorts (with replenishment) of adult
   smokers annually (five waves: 2002-2006), in Canada, United States, UK
   and Australia (around 2000 per country per wave; total n = 17 773).
   Measures were of pack warning salience (reading and noticing); cognitive
   responses (thoughts of harm and quitting); and two behavioural
   responses: forgoing cigarettes and avoiding the warnings.
   Results: All four indicators of impact increased markedly among
   Australian smokers following the introduction of graphic warnings.
   Controlling for date of introduction, they stimulated more cognitive
   responses than the UK (text-only) changes, and were avoided more, did
   not significantly increase forgoing cigarettes, but were read and
   noticed less. The findings also extend previous work showing partial
   wear-out of both graphic and text-only warnings, but the Canadian
   warnings have more sustained effects than UK ones.
   Conclusions: Australia's new health warnings increased reactions that
   are prospectively predictive of cessation activity. Warning size
   increases warning effectiveness and graphic warnings may be superior to
   text-based warnings. While there is partial wear-out in the initial
   impact associated with all warnings, stronger warnings tend to sustain
   their effects for longer. These findings support arguments for
   governments to exceed minimum FCTC requirements on warnings.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Graphical tobacco product labelling is a prominent source of
   health information and has an important position among tobacco control
   initiatives. However, little is known about its effectiveness among
   adolescents. With this above in mind, we aimed to research into how
   adolescents perceive the proposed EU graphic tobacco product warning
   labels as an effective means of preventing smoking initiation in
   comparison to the current EU text-only warning labels. Methods: Five
   hundred seventy four adolescents (1318, 54 male) from Greece were
   privately interviewed, with the use of a digital questionnaire and
   randomly shown seven existing EU text-only and proposed EU graphic
   warning labels. Non-smoking respondents were asked to compare and rate
   the warnings effectiveness in regard to preventing them from smoking on
   a 15 Likert type scale. Results: Irrespective of the warning category
   shown, on all occasions, non-smoking adolescents rated the suggested EU
   graphic labels as more effective in preventing them from smoking in
   comparison to the existing EU text-only warnings. Controlling for
   gender, age, current smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked per
   month, younger adolescents were found to opt for graphic warnings more
   often, and also perceive graphic warning labels as a more effective
   means of preventing them from smoking, in comparison to their elder
   peers (P 0.001). Conclusions: The proposed EU graphic warning labels may
   play an important role in preventing of smoking initiation during the
   crucial years of early adolescence when smoking experimentation and
   early addiction usually take place.}},

Abstract = {{The study estimated the reduction in demand associated with implementing
   cigarette package warning labels that contain imagery illustrating the
   consequences of smoking. The experimental auction method was used,
   wherein adult smokers in Mexico (n = 89) placed separate bids on two
   packs of cigarettes: one with a text-only warning label and the other
   with a warning label that included text and a graphic image. Differences
   in the values attributed to each pack were assessed using t-tests and
   multivariate regression. The pack with the graphic image had a mean
   attributed value which was 17\% lower (S3.21 pesos) than the pack with
   the text-only warning, and this difference remained statistically
   significant within subgroups defined by sociodemographics, amount of
   smoking, number of quit attempts, and levels of perceived smoking risks.
   In the multivariate model, the difference in attributed values was
   greater among females than males, but no such differences were found for
   other sociodemographic or smoking-related variables. The consistently
   lower value that smokers attributed to cigarette packages with the
   graphic warning label indicates that these labels are likely to reduce

Abstract = {{Background: Evidence from previous studies suggests that heavy alcohol
   use (HAU) exacerbates the rate of fibrosis progression in the liver and
   results in increased probability for premature death among patients with
   hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The current study uses
   population-based mortality data to investigate whether heavy drinking
   affects the age of death among individuals with HCV and, if so, whether
   this effect differs between men and women.
   Methods: A total of 7,263,163 death records in the United States between
   2000 and 2002 were drawn from the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD)
   public-use data files compiled by the National Center for Health
   Statistics (NCHS). International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
   Revision (ICD-10) codes were used to identify the presence of HCV (B17.1
   and B18.2) and HAU (as indicated by alcohol-induced medical conditions,
   F10 and K70) either as the underlying cause or as one of the
   contributing causes of death. The deaths were divided into 4 distinctive
   cause-of-death categories: HCV without HAU, HAU without HCV, HCV plus
   HAU, and all others. The mean ages of death and the cumulative
   probabilities of death derived from multiple-cause life table were
   compared across these categories.
   Results: Hepatitis C virus deaths showed an excessive prevalence of HAU
   when compared with non-HCV deaths. Compared with deaths of HCV without
   HAU, the mean age of death was shortened for deaths of HCV plus HAU
   (from 55.1 to 50.0 years among males, and from 61.0 to 49.1 years among
   females). The cumulative probability of death before age 65 was much
   higher for the latter than the former group (0.91 vs 0.68 among males,
   and 0.88 vs 0.47 among females). While HCV alone showed a
   disproportionate effect on premature death in males, HAU presented a
   stronger effect in females, resulting in a ``catching-up{''} effect that
   diminished the gender difference in age of HCV death.
   Conclusions: This study provides mortality-based evidence to further
   establish heavy alcohol consumption as one of the key risk factors
   contributing to premature deaths from HCV in the United States. More
   importantly, this study, for the first time, presents empirical evidence
   that alcohol consumption affects men and women differently in HCV
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: A large body of epidemiologic literature has found an
   association of increased fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) with
   acute and chronic mortality. The effect of improvements in particle
   exposure is less clear.
   Objectives: Earlier analysis of the Harvard Six Cities adult cohort
   study showed an association between long-term ambient PM2.5 and
   mortality between enrollment in the mid-1970s and follow-up until 1990.
   We extended mortality follow-up for 8 yr in a period of reduced air
   pollution concentrations.
   Methods: Annual city-specific PM2.5 concentrations were measured between
   1979 and 1988, and estimated for later years from publicly available
   data. Exposure was defined as (1) city-specific mean PM2.5 during the
   two follow-up periods, (2) mean PM2.5 in the first period and change
   between these periods, (3) overall mean PM2.5 across the entire
   follow-up, and (4) year-specific mean PM2.5. Mortality rate ratios were
   estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression controlling for
   individual risk factors.
   Measurements and Main Results: We found an increase in overall mortality
   associated with each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 modeled either as
   the overall mean (rate ratio {[}RR], 1.16; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 1.07-1.26) or as exposure in the year of death (IRR, 1.14; 95\%
   Cl, 1.06-1.22). PM2.5 exposure was associated with lung cancer (1111,
   1.27; 95\% Cl, 0.96-1.69) and cardiovascular deaths (RR, 1.28;95\% Cl,
   1.13-1.44). Improved overall mortality was associated with decreased
   mean PM2.5 (10 mu g/m(3)) between periods (RR, 0.73; 95\% Cl,
   0.57-0.95).
   Conclusion: Total, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality were each
   positively associated with ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Reduced PM2.5
   concentrations were associated with reduced mortality risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Since 1989 when health warning labels appeared on Canadian
   cigarette packages, the labels have changed from text only covering less
   than one quarter of the package to text and graphics covering over half
   the package. This study examines how Canadians in their 20s feel about
   the current graphic warning labels and their potential to prevent
   smoking and encourage quitting.
   Methods: Participants between 20 and 24 years of age were part of a
   10-year cohort study begun when the group was in Grade 6, with the
   purpose of examining factors that may affect smoking. Five questions
   about warning labels were added to the 2002 questionnaire requesting
   information on perceptions of the labels and their potential impact on
   smoking behaviours of young adults. One item had been included in
   previous questionnaires.
   Results: 32.8\% (n=1267) of the respondents were smokers, with males
   (35.6\%) being more likely to smoke than females (30.4\%). Current
   smokers were less likely than experimental/ex-smokers to believe that
   warning labels with stronger messages would make people their age less
   likely to smoke. Female current smokers were more likely to think about
   quitting.
   Conclusion: Despite the efforts taken in developing the labels, some
   young adults are skeptical about their effects. Warning labels may have
   to be modified to target issues that are relevant to young adults;
   gender differences are important in this modification. Warning labels
   can offer an additional component to a comprehensive tobacco control
   program, in that they provide health information.}},

Abstract = {{To generate current incidence-based estimates of the direct medical
   costs of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the United States, a Markov
   model of the economic costs of CAD-related medical care was developed.
   Risks of initial and subsequent CAD events (sudden CAD death,
   fatal/nonfatal acute myocardial infarction {[}AMI], unstable angina, and
   stable angina) were estimated using new Framingham Heart Study risk
   equations and population risk profiles derived from national survey
   data. Costs were assumed to be those related to treatment of initial and
   subsequent CAD events ({''}event-related{''}) and follow-up care
   ({''}nonevent-related{''}), respectively. Cost estimates were derived
   primarily from national public-use databases. First-year direct medical
   costs of treating CAD events are estimated to be \$17,532 for fatal AMI,
   \$15,540 for nonfatal AMI, \$2,569 for stable angina, \$12,058 for
   unstable angina, and \$713 for sudden CAD death. Nonevent-related direct
   costs of CAD treatment are estimated to be \$1,051 annually. The annual
   incidence of CAD in the United States is estimated at 616,900 cases,
   with first-year costs of treatment totaling \$5.54 billion. Five- and
   10-year cumulative costs in 1995 dollars for patients who are initially

Title = {{Employment implications of declining tobacco product sales for the
   regional economies of the United States}},
Journal = {{JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION}},

Abstract = {{Objective.-To determine whether declines in tobacco product sales
   significantly reduce employment in the United States, as the tobacco
   industry claims.
   Design.-Computer simulation of the economies of the Southeast Tobacco
   region and 8 nontobacco regions of the United States, with domestic
   tobacco expenditures eliminated or reduced and the equivalent spending
   redistributed, according to consumers' normal spending patterns, We
   compared these results with baseline forecasts of the regional economies
   that include normal tobacco expenditures.
   Main Outcome Measure.-Number of jobs.
   Results.-Had there been no spending on tobacco products in the United
   States in 1993, the Southeast Tobacco region would have had 303 000
   fewer jobs. Collectively, however, the 8 nontobacco regions would have
   gained enough employment to completely offset losses in the Southeast
   Tobacco region, with every nontobacco region gaining jobs. By the year
   2000, the absence of tobacco spending would mean a loss of 222 000 jobs
   in the Southeast Tobacco region, but a gain of 355 000 throughout the
   rest of the country. In the more realistic scenario of doubling the
   downward trend in tobacco consumption, the Southeast Tobacco region
   would lose 6300 jobs in 1993 (0.03\% of regional employment) and 36 600
   jobs by 2000 (0.2\%). The 8 nontobacco regions would gain 6400 jobs in
   1993 and 56 300 jobs in 2000, with each of the nontobacco regions
   gaining employment in every year.
   Conclusions.-Contrary to the tobacco industry's claims, reductions in
   spending on tobacco products will boost employment in every one of the 8
   nontobacco regions and will not diminish employment in the Southeast
   Tobacco region by as much as the industry estimates. The primary concern
   about tobacco should be the enormity of its toll on health and not its
   impact on employment.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The US Year 2000 mortality objectives are model standards
   cast as targeted changes in age-adjusted cause-specific death rates.
   This research centred on the projected impact of such changes on life
   expectancy and the mortality toll for each sex.
   Methods. A computer simulation was conducted using single decrement,
   multiple decrement and cause-elimination life table techniques, together
   with a decomposition procedure.
   Results. Male and female life expectancy at birth was projected to
   increase by 1.71 and 1.51 years, respectively, between the designated
   1987 baseline and 2000. The leading beneficiaries would be those aged 65
   and older, followed by those aged 45-64, and infants. Declines in
   coronary heart disease, stroke and injury death rates would most
   influence the projected life expectancy changes, irrespective of sex.
   Approximately 782 000 male deaths and 730 000 female deaths would be
   averted under Year 2000 assumptions.
   Conclusions. Life expectancy would be a useful summary measure to
   incorporate into official evaluations of the Year 2000 mortality
   objectives. Targeting of excess male mortality in the US and other
   highly industrialized nations is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{In a further follow-up study of the Cincinnati Lead Study Cohort, 253
   children were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
   Children-Revised (WISC-R) at approximately 6.5 years of age. Postnatal
   blood lead concentrations were inversely associated with Full-Scale
   (FSIQ) and Performance IQ (PIQ). Following statistical adjustment for
   developmental co-factors such as maternal IQ and an assessment of the
   quality of caretaking in the home environment, a statistically
   significant relationship remained between postnatal blood lead
   concentrations and PIQ. Further statistical analyses suggested that
   averaged lifetime blood lead concentrations in excess of 20 mug/dL were
   associated with deficits in PIQ on the order of approximately 7 points
   when compared to children with mean concentrations less or equal to 10
   mug/dL. These results are discussed in terms of their consistency with
   other similar studies as well as their internal consistency with earlier
   reports on this cohort. The findings of this investigation support
   recent initiatives in the United States to reduce the exposure of
   children to environmental lead.}},
