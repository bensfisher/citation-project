Albuterol HFA MDIs are the subject of patents, listed in our publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book), which will, presumably, block the marketing of generic albuterol HFA MDIs until they expire. See our response to comment 36 of this document for a discussion of the patent issues that were raised in this rulemaking. There is a separate essential-use designation for metereddose ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate, in combination, administered by oral inhalation for human use, § 2.125(e)(2)(viii). This essential use was added to the list of essential uses (§ 2.125(e)), even though albuterol and ipratropium bromide were already separately included in the list of essential uses. (See 60 FR 53725, October 17, 1995, and 61 FR 15699, April 9, 1996.) The only drug product marketed under the essential-use designation for metered-dose ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate, in combination, is Boehringer Ingelheim Phamaceuticals&apos; product COMBIVENT.

We received 22 comments on the 1999 proposed rule. After minor revisions in response to these comments, we published a final rule in the Federal Register of July 24, 2002 (67 FR 48370) (the 2002 final rule) (corrected in 67 FR 49396, July 30, 2002, and 67 FR 58678, September 17, 2002). Among other changes, the 2002 final rule, in revised § 2.125(g)(3), set standards that FDA would use for determining whether the use of an ODS in a medical product is no longer essential. The 2002 final rule provided that to remove an essential-use designation, FDA must find that: (cid:120) At least one non-ODS product with the same active moiety is marketed with the same route of administration, for the same indication, and with approximately the same level of convenience of use as the ODS product containing that active moiety; (cid:120) Supplies and production capacity for the non-ODS product(s) exist or will exist at levels sufficient to meet patient need</context>

To produce or import CFCs for an essential use under the Montreal Protocol, a Party must request and obtain approval for an exemption at a meeting of the Parties. One of the most important essential uses of CFCs under the Montreal Protocol is their use in MDIs for the treatment of asthma and COPD. The decision on whether the use of CFCs in MDIs is &amp;quot;essential&amp;quot; for purposes of the Montreal Protocol turns on whether: &amp;quot;(1) It is necessary for the health, safety, or is critical for the functioning of society (encompassing cultural and intellectual aspects) and (2) there are no available technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health&amp;quot; (Decision IV/25). Each request and any subsequent exemption is for only 1 year&apos;s duration (Decision V/18). Since 1994 the United States and some other Parties to the Montreal Protocol have annually requested, and been granted, essential-use exemptions for the production or importation of CFCs for their use in MDIs for the treatment of asthma and COPD (see, among others, Decisions VI/9 and VII/28). The exemptions have been 12 consistent wit</context>

Albuterol HFA MDIs are the subject of patents, listed in our publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book), which will, presumably, block the marketing of generic albuterol HFA MDIs until they expire. See our response to comment 36 of this document for a discussion of the patent issues that were raised in this rulemaking. There is a separate essential-use designation for metereddose ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate, in combination, administered by oral inhalation for human use, § 2.125(e)(2)(viii). This essential use was added to the list of essential uses (§ 2.125(e)), even though albuterol and ipratropium bromide were already separately included in the list of essential uses. (See 60 FR 53725, October 17, 1995, and 61 FR 15699, April 9, 1996.) The only drug product marketed under the essential-use designation for metered-dose ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate, in combination, is Boehringer Ingelheim Phamaceuticals&apos; product COMBIVENT. Because COMBIVENT has two active ingredients, it is not subject to Decision XV/5, which concerns MDIs with albuterol as the sole active 20</context>
<context position="156255" citStr="(2)" startWordPosition="24863" endWordPosition="24863">the Medicaid program, suggesting that Medicaid spending on albuterol MDIs after 115 rebates would have been roughly $100 million higher in 2003 if albuterol CFC MDIs were not available. It is important to note that this is a rough estimate, as rebates for a specific drug may differ from the 20 percent estimate. Incomplete data for 2004 suggest that comparable estimates for 2004 are higher but we believe that these are not reliable because of the incompleteness of the data. b. Medicare. Our analysis of the impacts of this rule on Medicare addresses: (1) The total utilization of albuterol MDIs, (2) the likely price increase, and (3) the aggregate spending increase. CMS estimates that noninstitutionalized Medicare beneficiaries not eligible for Medicaid drug coverage filled about 8 million prescriptions for albuterol MDIs (including VENTOLIN and PROVENTIL) in 2001, based on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) and with an adjustment for underreporting for aggregate analysis purposes. As noted below, this estimate is based on Medicare beneficiaries&apos; self-reported outpatient prescription drug utilization, including prescriptions filled at both retail and mail order pharmacies.
