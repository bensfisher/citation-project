Using unique panel data of 401(k) plans in the U.S., we present three principle findings. First, we show that the share of investment options in a particular asset class (i.e., company stock, equities, fixed income, and balanced funds) has a significant effect on aggregate participant portfolio allocations across these asset classes. Second, we document that the vast majority of the new funds added to 401 (k) plans are high-cost actively-managed equity funds, as opposed to lower-cost equity index funds. Third, because the average share of assets invested in low-cost equity index funds declines with an increase in the number of options, average portfolio expenses increase and average portfolio performance is thus depressed. All of these findings are obtained from a panel data set, enabling us to control for heterogeneity in the investment preferences of workers across firms and across time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A random sample of fluoroscopic facilities was selected to be surveyed for the Nationwide Evaluation of X-ray Trends program. Measurements were performed by using a newly developed fluoroscopic phantom. The surveys were conducted by state radiation control personnel. RESULTS: Average air kerma rates 1 cm above the tabletop, free in air, were 43 mGy/min (n = 340). The rate increased to 64 mGy/min when a 1.6-mm-thick copper filter, which simulated the use of barium contrast medium, was added to increase attenuation. The average entrance air kerma, free in air, for radiographs was 3.4 mGy, and an average of 12 radiographs were obtained per examination. Of 352 facilities surveyed, 306 (87%) were able to resolve wire mesh with 20 or more lines per inch. Of 339 facilities for which percentage contrast could be calculated, 192 (57%) had minimum percentage contrast values of 4% or more. CONCLUSION: Spatial resolution for fluoroscopy is adequate for most of the facilities surveyed, but a substantial proportion of facilities could not visualize low-contrast test objects, which strongly suggests image quality problems.",,,"Unable to access pdf from journal provided on library website; therefore, funding source unclear",,0910-AC34,"Strategies for Improvement in Performance, Radiation Safety and Control",Proceedings of the ACR/FDA Workshop on Fluoroscopy,,American College of Radiology,,1993,Article,,,,,,Not sure on author; no actual name given,,0910-AC34,Comparison of Beam-Hardening and K-Edge Filters for Imaging Barium and Iodine During Fluoroscopy,Medical Physics,,"Gagne, R.M.; Quinn, P.W.; Jennings, R.J.","Offices of Science and Technology Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration",Jan-94,Scholarly Journal,10.1118/1.597242, 0094-2405,"This study investigated the dose reduction performance of several beam_hardening and K_edge filter materials for the imaging of barium or iodine during fluoroscopy. A computermodel was developed to simulate the effect of added filtration on entrance exposure rate (X p ), integral dose rate (D i ), contrast (C), signal to noise ratio (SNR), imaging performance per dose (SNR2/D i ), and tube load. The model incorporated the response characteristics, in both manual and automatic control modes of operation, of fluoroscopic systems to increasing or decreasing x_ray intensity at the input of the image intensifier. Input parameters to the computermodel included choice of filter material and thickness, a barium or iodine test object, tube potential, phantom thickness, a CsI input phosphor, and a set of algorithms for controlling the fluoroscopic system. In all cases, the performance of systems with added filtration was judged with respect to a reference system operating under comparable conditions. In general, either beam_hardening or K_edge filters provided a significant reduction in entrance exposure and integral dose rates, but with an attendant increase in tube load. For a fluoroscopic system constrained to follow a representative automatic brightness control algorithm, added filtration provided a reduction in entrance exposure and integral dose rates for all phantom or uniformly distributed barium thicknesses. However, the imaging performance per dose, in some cases, decreased rapidly and was less than that of the reference system at large thicknesses. Only a change in the algorithm controlling the kVcp and mA operating points on the fluoroscopic system provided an imaging performance per dose greater than the reference systemês at large thicknesses. The practical implementation of adding filtration to fluoroscopic systems is most simply accomplished with beam_hardening filters rather than K_edge filters. However, the systems with K_edge added filtration can provide slightly better performance when used over a limited range of phantom thicknesses such as the range normally associated with pediatric patients.",,,"Also unable to access from library, journal also not provided; could not find funding source",,0910-AC34,Radiological Protection and Safety in Medicine,,Annals of the ICRP,"Zuur, C.; Mettler F.",International Comission on Radiological Protection,1996,Article,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation,,UNSCEAR 2000 Report to the General Assembly,United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation,,2000,Article,,,,,,"given during a report for UN, so could it be a gov report?",,0910-AC34,The Use of a Dose-Area Product Network to Facilitate the Establishment of Dose Reference Levels,,ERPET Course for Medical Physicists on Establishment of Reference Levels in Diagnostic Radiology,"Rogers, A.T.; et al.",,2000,Article,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,A National Survey of Doses to Patients Undergoing a Selection of Routine X_Ray Examinations in English Hospitals ,,,"Shrimpton, P.C.; et al.",,Sep-86,Other,,,,,,Non-US Government report,,0910-AC34,Doses to Patients from Medical X-Ray Examinations in the UK-1995 Review,,,"Hart, D.; et al.",National Radiological Protection Board,Jul-96,Other,,,,,,Non-US government report,,0910-AC34,Nationwide Evaluation of X-Ray Trends Summary of 1996 Fluoroscopy Survey,,,"Kaczmarek, R.",,2000,Article,,,,,,un published draft?,,0910-AC34,Energy Distributions and Air Kerma Rates of ISO and BIPM Reference Filtered X-Radiations,,,"Laitano, R.F.; et al.",Comitato Nazionale per la Ricerca e per lo Sviluppo dellêEnergia Nucleare e delle Energie Alternative,1990,Other,,,,,,Non-US Government report,,0910-AC34,Development of a Method to Calculate Organ Doses for the Upper Gastrointestinal Fluoroscopic Examination,,,"Suleiman, O.H.",Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health,1989,Other,,,,,,Ph.D. dissertation,,0910-AC34,Handbook of Selected Tissue Doses for the Upper Gastrointestinal Fluoroscopic Examination,,HHS Publication FDA 92_8282,"Rosenstein, M; et al.","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health",1992,Government Report,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,A Comparison of Patient Dose for Examinations of the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract at 11 Conventional and Digital Units in The Netherlands,The British Journal of Radiology,,"Geleijns, J.; et al.",Leiden University,Jul-98,Scholarly Journal,10.1259/bjr.71.847.9771385,0007-1285,"The objective of this study was to derive the effective dose to patients from examinations of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract at 11 X-ray units in 10 Dutch hospitals. Entrance dose and entrance dose rate were measured at the surface of a homogeneous PMMA phantom and at the entrance surface of the image intensifier. Dose-area products (DAPs) were assessed during examinations of patients. The patients (334 females and 256 males) ages were 18-95 years (average 52 years). Effective dose was assessed from DAP using Monte Carlo computer calculations for male and female mathematical anthropomorphic phantoms. The DAPs measured during the survey showed substantial variations, i.e. an overall average value of 21 Gy cm(2) and a range of average DAP per X-ray unit varying from 7 to 56 Gy cm(2). Variations in the number of images (8-28) and the fluoroscopy time (1.7 min-7.0 min) were also large. A DAP to effective dose conversion factor of 0.32 mSv Gy cm(-2) was derived for upper GI studies. The dose survey yielded an overall average effective dose of 6.7 mSv. At one location an examination involving as many as 28 projections was performed, whilst maintaining a DAP well below 15 Gy cm(2) and an effective dose below 6 mSv. This was achieved using modern equipment (i.e. high frequency generator, digital spot films) with 0.2 mm additional copper filtration and a relatively high tube voltage. For examinations of the upper GI tract, the application of a reference value of 30 Gy cm(2) for the DAP will ensure that, in general, the effective dose to individual patients will not exceed 15 mSv.",,,"Also unable to acces from library, journal also not provided; could not find funding source",,0910-AC34,Handbook of Selected Tissue Doses for Fluoroscopic and Cineangiographic Examination of the Coronary Arteries (in SI Units),,HHS Publication FDA 95_8289,"Stern, S.H.; et al.","U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health",Sep-95,Government Report,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,Nationwide Inpatient Sample Release 6 for 1997,,Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project,Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality,,Aug-00,Government Report,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,Evolving Trends in Interventional Device Use and Outcomes: Results from the National Cardiovascular Network Database,American Heart Journal,,"Peterson, ED; et al",Duke University; The Washington Heart Hospital Center; Brigham and Women's Hospital; National Cardiovascular Network,Feb-00,Scholarly Journal,10.1016/S0002-8703(00)90226-6,see note,"Background Although multiple new coronary interventional devices have been approved for marketing in the United States, use of these technologies in general clinical practice and their associated outcomes have not been reported. Methods and Results Using the National Cardiovascular Network's Coronary Interventional Database, we examined temporal trends in the use and outcomes of coronary stents, lasers, directional atherectomy, and rotational atherectomy devices at 12 US hospitals between January 1994 and December 1997 (n = 76,904). Over this period, the percentage of cases involving coronary stents rose more than 12-fold (from 5.4% in 1994 to 69.0% in 1997). In contrast, use of atherectomy-type devices declined significantly. Device selection was strongly influenced by the patient's coronary anatomy and procedural indication, but less by age, sex, or race. Device use also varied significantly among individual centers (4-fold variation among sites in stent use and 6-fold variation in atherectomy use) even after adjusting for patient characteristics. Although overall mortality rates were unchanged during this 4-year period, procedural success rates have improved and complication rates have declined significantly. lengths of postprocedure hospital stay also fell significantly for all patients undergoing coronary intervention in this time period. Conclusions Percutaneous interventional strategies are rapidly changing with the explosive growth of coronary stent use and the decline in use of atherectomy devices. Patient outcomes, including complication rates and postprocedure lengths of stay, have also improved as the new interventional strategies have been refined in clinical practice.",,National Cardiovascular Network,for some reason the ISSN isn't appearing right on this one cell it's 0002-8703,,0910-AC34,Fatal Tradeoffs: Public and Private Responsibilities for Risk,,,"Viscusi, K",,1992,Book,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,"The Value of Reducing Risks of Death: A Note on NewEvidence",Journal of Policy Analysis and Management,,"Fisher, A; et al.","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; RCG/Hagler, Baily, Inc.",1989,Scholarly Journal,10.2307/3324426,0276-8739,"Government agencies face difficult resource-allocation decisions when confronted with projects that will reduce risks of fatality.

Criterion validity is shown to be irrelevant to health status measures because of the lack of a single specific, directly observable measure of health for use as a criterion. To overcome this problem, the Index of Well-being has been constructed to fulfill the definition of content validity by including all levels of function and symptom/problem complexes, a clearly defined relation to the death state, and consumer ratings of the relative desirability of the function levels. Data from a two-wave household interview survey provide convergent evidence of construct validity by demonstrating an expected positive correlation of the Index of Well-being with self-rated well-being and expected negative correlations with age, number of chronic medical conditions, number of reported symptoms or problems, number of physician contacts, and dysfunctional status. Discriminant evidence of construct validity is demonstrated by predicted differences in correlation between concurrent Index of Well-being scores and self-assessed overall health status, and between the Index of Well-being scores and self-rated well-being on different days.

The indicators possess the statistical properties required for time series and interpopulation comparisons, for studying outcomes and quality of medical care, and for health system optimization in planning and policy analysis.",,Bureau of Health Services Research,info found at http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00186756,,0910-AC34,"Expectation of Life and Expected Death by Race, Sex, and Age",,Vital Statistics of the United States,U.S. National Center for Health Statistics,,1995,Government Report,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,Estimating the Cost to Society of Consumer Product Injuries,,,U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission,National Public Services Research Institute,Jan-98,Government Report,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,"Health-Related Quality of Life Measurement forEvaluation Research and Policy Analysis",Health Psychology,,"Kaplan, R.; Bush, J.",,1982,Article,,,,,,,,0910-AC34,Compliance Testing Program,,,Food and Drug Administration,,"January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2000",Government Report,,,,,,series of data referred to by the RIA,,0910-AC34,Manufacturing Industry Series report on Irradiation Apparatus Manufacturing for NAICS code 334517,,1997 Economic Census,Manufacturing Industry Series,,1997,Government Report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0910-AF18,Guidance for Industry: Integration of Dose-Counting Mechanisms into MDI Drug Products,,,U.S. Food and Drug Administration,,Mar-93,Government Report,,,,,,,,0910-AF18,Accuracy of Float Testing for Metered-Dose Inhaler Canisters,Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association,,"Penick, Brock T.; et al",,July/August 2002,Article,,,,,,,,0910-AF18,Prospective Observational Cohort Safety Study to Monitor the Introduction of a Non-CFC Formulation of Salbutamol with HFA 134a in England,International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics,,"Craig-McFeely, P.M.; et al.",Drug Safety Research Unit; GlaxoSmithKline; London School of Hygiene,3-Feb,Scholarly Journal,10.5414/CPP41067, 0946-1965,"Objective: To monitor the safety of a salbutamol MDI with a hydrofluoroalkane propellant (Ventolin Evohaler) during its introduction into primary care use in England. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study. 1,365 GPs in England submitted data on 10,472 regular users of Ventolin MDI, over five 3-month periods of observation between October 1, 1998 and December 31, 1999. The primary aim was to compare event rates occurring before and after the introduction of Ventolin Evohaler. The secondary aim was a comparison of event rates between users of Ventolin Evohaler and Ventolin MDI. The main outcome measures were: indication for use of Ventolin MDI, assessment of disease severity, event rates during each period of observation; deaths, pregnancies, reported adverse drug reactions and reasons for discontinuation of MDI. Event rates were adjusted using a ratio for under-reporting derived from a validation study on 4.6% of the study population and stratified by severity of indication. Results: The primary indication was asthma in 94%, distributed by severity as 47% mild, 44% moderate and 9% severe; 13% were children. By October 1999, 52.7% of the 8,973 remaining patients had transitioned to Ventolin Evohaler. There was no increase in major or minor events observed following the introduction of Ventolin Evohaler. No serious adverse events, abnormal pregnancy outcomes or deaths have been related to Ventolin MDI or Ventolin Evohaler. The validation study showed a degree of under-reporting. Conclusion: These results on a large cohort of community patients in England indicate that Ventolin Evohaler is well tolerated among asthmatics.",,,"Could not access on Umass page, found using ResearchGate unable to find funder",,0910-AF18,Pharmacy Benefits and the Use of Drugs by the Chronically Ill,The Journal of the America Medical Association,,"Goldman, J.; et al.",,4-May,Article,, ,,,,This is actually a scholarly journal that I had misinterpreted.

The distribution of sample medications to physicians by pharmaceutical manufacturers has been regulated by Congress and extensively critiqued in the medical literature. Manufacturers distributed 2.4 billion samples in 1988, yet there are no published reports on die clinical use of sample medications. Methods. A 4-week descriptive study was conducted that catalogued the contents of a sample medication collection in a family practice residency model office, calculated the value of the sample collection (average wholesale price [AWP]), and monitored dispensing of medication samples. Results. The collection initially contained 5546 samples with an AWP of $19,273. A total of 1012 samples worth $4154 was withdrawn from the collection during the study period. Patients received 548 of the sample packages in 105 dispensements ($2583), physicians or their families received 169 samples in 44 dispensements ($603), others received 26 samples in 6 dispensements ($152), and the destination of 269 samples ($816) was unknown. When a prescription was written at the time that a sample was dispensed, it was almost always for the same brand-name medication. Conclusions. Although a majority of medications dispensed were given to patients, approximately one third of the value of the medications withdrawn either went to physicians and their families or had an unknown destination. The high association of sample dispensing and simultaneous prescribing of the same brand-name drug supports the contention that sampling influences physician-prescribing habits. Further research should define how the availability of free sample medications affect physician-prescribing practices.",,,Could not find in Journal logs; unable to find doi,,0910-AF18,Disposition of Pharmaceutical Samples from a Private Medical Clinic,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association,,"Peterson, M.C.;

It examines five basic approaches to evaluating the effect of a policy action on employment: 1) supply and demand analysis of the affected sector; 2) partial equilibrium analysis of multiple markets; 3) fixed-price, general equilibrium simulations (input-output (I-O) and social accounting matrix (SAM) multiplier models); 4) non-linear, general equilibrium simulations (Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models); and 5) econometric estimation of the adjustment process, particularly time series analysis. The basic modeling structure and data requirements for each of these approaches are described. Simple examples of their application to evaluation of environmental and natural resource policy are developed and the relative merits and applicability of each are discussed.",,,Could not find funding sources http://download.springer.com.silk.library.umass.edu/static/pdf/444/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1015531702905.pdf?auth66=1426386021_29cc56075ea8a1d8b873c9eace97c812&ext=.pdf,,2060-AK70,Executive Analysis of Federal Regulations Under Executive Order 12866,,"Executive Office of the President, Office Management and Budget",Office Management and Budget,,Jan-96,Government Report,,,,,,http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg/print/riaguide.html,,2060-AK70,Contestable Markets: An Uprising in the Theory of Industry Structure,American Economic Review,,"Baumol, W.",New York University,1982,Scholarly Journal,, 0002-8282,"The article reports on work that the author has done with his colleagues and writers, John Panzar and Robert Willig.

Not only Panzar and Willig, but many others have made crucial contributions to the formulation of the theory.

Explanatory variables include functional form, lag structure, time span, national setting, estimation technique, and other features of the model structure. Elasticity estimates are found to be sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of some measure of vehicle ownership. Static models appear to overestimate short-run elasticities, underestimate long-run price elasticities, but pick up the full long-run income responsiveness.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In December 1999, all 198 blood collection establishments (BCEs) and 5442 hospital transfusion services (TSs) in the United States were surveyed by mailed questionnaire to evaluate their progress in carrying out this notification. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of the BCEs and 64 percent of the TSs responded. After correcting for nonresponse, an estimated 98,484 components at potential risk for transmitting HCV, according to previous testing of multiantigen-screened donors, were identified nationwide, of which 85 percent had been transfused to recipients. Lookback for these recipients was completed for 80 percent, of whom 69 percent had died. Of those living, 78 percent were successfully notified. An estimated 49.5 percent of those notified were tested, 18.9 percent of those tested were anti-HCV positive, and 32 percent of that group knew they were positive before notification. On the basis of an 85.5 percent reported completion rate for component notifications back through 1988, an estimated 1520 persons will have been newly identified as anti-HCV-positive when lookback related to multiantigen screening of donors is completed.

To comply with FDA requirements, DHS developed a centralized process that utilized the services of a contract vendor for performing HCV lookback. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: A DHS public health nurse acted as HCV lookback coordinator and as liaison with the vendor. Cases were electronically forwarded to the vendor, who then reviewed the patient's chart to obtain information necessary for tracking the patient through commercial databases. The vendor was responsible for notifying the recipient for pretest counseling and for providing documentation of all efforts. RESULTS: In total, 411 recipients were identified, of which, 168 cases were completed by the hospitals, 243 were forwarded to the vendor, 50 percent were deceased, 21 percent were contacted, and 28 percent could not be contacted, and 1 percent could not be located on any databases. The vendor contacted 35 of 66 cases that the hospitals had unsuccessfully attempted to contact. Of the cases forwarded to the vendor, 82 percent were completed on time. Delays were attributable to the vendor in less than 2 percent of cases. The cost per case forwarded to the vendor was $322. CONCLUSION: Utilizing a professional service to conduct HCV recipient notifications is an effective strategy for meeting FDA deadlines and for freeing transfusion service staff to perform critical functions.

Interferon-alpha 2b can induce clinical, biochemical, and virologic remission in some patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the long-term cost-effectiveness of this treatment, particularly in patients with histologically mild disease, is unknown. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha 2b in mild chronic hepatitis C. Design: Meta-analysis of five prospective trials and cost-effectiveness analysis. Projection of the clinical and economic outcomes expected from loss of hepatitis C virus was done by using a Markov simulation. The potential effect of uncertainty in the model assumptions was tested by using sensitivity analyses. Data Sources: Search of the MEDLINE database, opinions of expert panels, hospital cost data, and adjusted physician charges. Patients: Hypothetical cohorts with histologically mild chronic hepatitis C. Intervention: The model assumed a single 6-month course of recombinant interferon-alpha 2b. Measurements: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios from a managed care perspective. Results: In 27% of patients with mild chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon-alpha 2b for 6 months, serum alanine aminotransferase levels permanently returned to normal and viral status remained negative. The model estimated that interferon-alpha 2b treatment in this population should increase life expectancy by 3.1 years if given at 20 years of age, by 1.5 years at 35 years of age, and by 22 days at 70 years of age; discounted marginal cost-effectiveness ratios are $500, $1900, and $62 000 per year of life gained, respectively. Varying the long-term response rates and progression rates for mild and moderate chronic hepatitis to near zero in sensitivity analyses substantially affected the results: Ratios ranged from $31 000 for a 20-year-old patient to $640 000 for a 70-year-old patient. Conclusions: On the basis of estimations in this mathematical model of the natural history of chronic hepatitis C, treating mild chronic hepatitis with interferon-alpha 2b should prolong life expectancy at a reasonable marginal cost per year of life gained, particularly in younger patients.",,Schering-Plough Corp,ISSN is 0003-4819; the cell was malfunctioning could not find doi,,0910-AB76,Understudied Populations with Hepatitis C,Hepatology,,"Strader, D.B.",Veterans Affairs Medical Center; Georgetown University,2002,Scholarly Journal,10.1053/jhep.2002.36991,0270-9139,"Managing patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection consists primarily of antiviral treatment, currently with peginterferon and ribavirin. Unfortunately, treatment recommendations derive largely from trials that have focused on highly selected patient populations. As a consequence of the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria in these studies, more than half of all HCV-infected patients would be ineligible for enrollment. Even among the selected patients enrolled into studies, only 50% achieve a sustained virological response (SVR). Patients not eligible for current therapies include those with mild disease and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, patients with advanced and decompensated liver disease, children, the elderly, patients with ongoing or recent alcohol and substance abuse, renal disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, severe psychiatric or neurologic illness, autoimmune disorders, solid organ transplant, and other significant comorbid conditions. Because these patients have been excluded from most clinical trials, little is known about the safety or efficacy of therapy in these populations. The expense and side effects of therapy are also an impediment to treatment of patients who are on public assistance, in prisons, and in institutions.

There is concern that the expense of interferon-alpha therapy may not be justified by the low response rates and uncertain long-term benefit. Objective: To compare clinical and economic outcomes after 6 months and 12 months of interferon-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Design: A Markov model depicting the natural progression of chronic hepatitis C. On the basis of this model, a simulated trial compared no therapy with 6 and 12 months of interferon-alpha therapy at standard doses (3 million U three times weekly). Patients: Four age-specific cohorts (30, 40, 50, and 60 years of age) with chronic hepatitis C. Measurements: Number of deaths from liver disease, total costs, and cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: Six and 12 months of interferon-alpha treatment gained 0.25 QALYs at an incremental cost of $1000 and 0.37 QALYs at an incremental cost of $1900, respectively. Thus, although 6 months of interferon-alpha therapy was less efficacious than 12 months of therapy, it was more cost-effective ($4000 per QALY gained compared with $5000 per QALY gained). Nonetheless, in patients younger than 60 years of age, both 6 and 12 months of therapy compared favorably with other established medical interventions, such as screening mammography and cholesterol reduction programs. Important variables affecting the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha treatment included the cost and efficacy of interferon-alpha, the cost of treatment for decompensated cirrhosis, and quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

As public health campaigns are pursued, a growing number of treatment candidates are likely to have minimal evidence of liver damage. Objective To examine the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of newer treatments for chronic hepatitis C infection in a population of asymptomatic, HCV seropositive but otherwise healthy individuals. Design and Setting Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection and impact of treatment. We used an epidemiologic model to derive a range of natural history parameters that were empirically calibrated to provide a good fit to observed data on both prevalence of HCV seropositivity and time trends in outcomes related to HCV infection. Patients Cohorts of 40-year-old men and women with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, positive results on quantitative HCV RNA assays and serologic tests for antibody to HCV, and no histological evidence of fibrosis on liver biopsy. Interventions Monotherapy with standard or pegylated interferon alfa-2b; combination therapy with standard or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Main Outcome Measures Lifetime costs, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results The probability of patients with chronic HCV developing cirrhosis over a 30-year period ranged from 13% to 46% for men and from 1% to 29% for women. The incremental cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with pegylated interferon for men ranged from $26000 to $64000 per QALY for genotype 1 and from $10000 to $28000 per QALY for other genotypes; and for women ranged from $32000 to $90000 for genotype 1 and from $12000 to $42000 for other genotypes. Because the benefits of treatment were realized largely in the form of improvements in health-related quality of life, rather than prolonged survivorship, cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as dollars per year of life were substantially higher. Results were most sensitive to assumptions about the gains and decrements in health-related quality of life associated with treatment. Conclusions While newer treatment options for hepatitis C appear to be reasonably cost-effective on average, these results vary widely across different patient subgroups and depend critically on quality-of-life assumptions. As the pool of persons eligible for treatment for HCV infection expands to the more general population, it will be imperative for patients and their physicians to consider these assumptions in making individual-level treatment decisions.",,,could not find funding,,0910-AB76,Cost Effectiveness of Interferon alpha _2b Combined with Ribavirin for the Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C,Hepatology,,"Younossi, Z.M., Singer, M.E.; McHutchison, J.G.; Shermock, K.M.",Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Case Western Reserve University; Scripps Reasearch Institute ,1999,Scholarly Journal,10.1002/hep.510300518,0270-9139,"Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with Interferon (IFN) alpha 2b monotherapy results in 10% to 15% sustained virological response (SVR). Combining IFN with ribavirin increases this response. In this analysis, using the Markov model, 6 treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis C (previously untreated) were compared on the basis of incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life years ($/QALY). Our results showed that the no treatment strategy was associated with a cost of $38,747 and 13.10 QALYs, The strategy using IFN alone for 48 weeks was associated with a cost of $35,642 and 14.05 QALYs. The strategy using IFN monotherapy followed by combination therapy for nonresponders and relapsers was associated with a cost: of $34,561 and 15.53 QALYs. A similar strategy, but limiting combination to relapsers only, was associated with a cost of $34,758 and 14.40 QALYs. The strategy using IFN with ribavirin as the initial therapy for all patients was associated with a cost of $34,792 and 15.31 QALYs. Finally the strategy using viral genotyping first and then adjusting. the duration of combination therapy based on genotype was associated with a cost of $37,263 and 15.89 QALYs. The strategy using genotyping to guide duration of combination therapy was the most cost-effective approach with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $7,500 per QALY.

In North America and Northem Europe, the seroprevalence rate of HCV in the general population is 1% to 2%. 1-3 Although most acute infections are asymptomatic, chronic hepatitis develops in approximately 80% of HCV-infected patients, which may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is transmitted primarily by parenteral exposure, with the major risk factor being parenteral drug use. 2 Before the institution of anti-HCV testing, the virus was responsible for the majority of cases of posttransfusion hepatitis. In the early 1980s, it was estimated that approximately 8% of transfusion recipients in the United States were infected by so-called ""non-A, non-B hepatitis."" With the introduction of measures such as the deferral of high-risk donors, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, and, in several countries, surrogate testing using alanine aminotransferase and hepatitis B core antibody, this risk decreased to 1% to 2% by 1990. 4 When first-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) screening and radioimmunoblot assay (RIBA) confirmatory testing were introduced in 1990, the seroprevalence of HCV in volunteer blood donors was found to range from 0.1% to 0.7% in North American and Northern European blood donors, with slightly higher rates in southem Europe) ,5 HCV is efficiently transmitted by transfusion; antiHCV antibodies develop in more than 90% of recipients of blood from donors whose stored sera test positive. 3,5,6 HCV has also been transmitted by clotting factor concentrates prepared in the 1970s and early 1980s that were not heat-treated or treated only with dry heat. More than 90% of hemophiliacs treated with these products were infected with HCV, 7 as were an estimated 280,000 Americans, 16,000 Canadians, and 100,000 French patients transfused during the 1980s. 8-1~ Although there is no curative treatment for HCV, approximately 50% of patients respond to alpha-interferon, with 10% to 20% achieving a long-term response.U Patients treated early in the course of infection are more likely to have a long-term response and presumably have delayed progression to cirrhosis and liver failure, although studies with lengthy follow-up have not yet been completed. 1,11 Because the risk of cirrhosis increases with alcohol use, infected persons may also benefit from counseling to avoid alcohol consumption. As the screening EIA for HCV has improved, the risk of posttransfusion infection has become vanishingly small, and is now estimated to be less than 1 in 100,000 units. 12 However, hospitals, blood collection agencies, and public health authorities in many countries continue to debate the advisability of informing previously transfused recipients of the possibility of infection and the efficiency of various methods of achieving this goal.

To examine these changes, we conducted national surveys of blood collection and transfusion in the United States in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1987 and made a limited survey of these activities in 1988. Transfusions of whole blood and red cells reached a peak of 12.2 million units in 1986, then declined to 11.6 million units in 1987 and continued to decline in 1988. Transfusions of plasma declined from a peak of 2.3 million units in 1984 to 2.1 million units in 1987. Growth in the use of platelet transfusions (6.4 million units in 1987) also slowed; however, the proportion of platelets transfused as platelets from single donors grew from 11 percent in 1980 to 25 percent in 1987. Donations of autologous blood increased sharply, from less than 30,000 units in 1982 to 397,000 units in 1987, equivalent to 3 percent of the homologous-blood collections. The growth in collections of homologous blood slowed after 1982. The supply of homologous blood reached a peak of 13.4 million units in 1986 and did not grow between 1986 and 1988. These trends in red-cell, plasma, and platelet transfusions appear to have continued through 1988. We conclude that the unprecedented decline in transfusions of whole blood and red cells, coupled with the continued importation of packed red cells from Western Europe and the offsetting effect of autologous predeposits, forestalled serious shortages of blood that could have resulted from the decline in collections of homologous blood. We attribute these changes in blood collection and blood transfusion to the effects of the epidemic of HIV infection.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With data supplied by the American Red Cross and the American Association of Blood Banks, as well as data from a stratified random-sample survey of 3350 non-American Association of Blood Banks hospitals, statistical methods were applied to estimate national blood activities in 1992. RESULTS: The total US blood supply in 1992 was 13,794,000 units, a decrease of 3.1 percent from 1989. Some 11,307,000 red cell units were transfused to 3,772,000 patients, an average of 3.0 units per transfused patient. Preoperative autologous blood deposits totaled 1,117,000 units, a 70-percent increase over 1989. Of this number, 566,000 units (50.7%) were transfused, 5,000 (4.4%) transferred to the allogeneic supply, and 546,000 (48.9%) discarded. Of 436,000 directed-donation units, 136,000 (31.2%) were transfused, 57,000 (13.1%) transferred to allogeneic supply, and 243,000 (55.7%) discarded. The total allogeneic blood supply, including imports, decreased by 7.4 percent from 1989, and allogeneic blood transfusions, including those to children, decreased by 8.6 percent. Over 8,300,000 platelet units were transfused; of these, some 3,600,000 were apheresis platelets. In addition, 2,255,000 units of plasma and 939,000 units of cryoprecipitate were transfused. CONCLUSION: While the US blood supply was adequate for transfusion needs in 1992, blood collections and red cell transfusions had decreased substantially since 1989.",,,unable to access article for free,,0910-AB76,"The Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States, 1988 Through 1994",The New England Journal of Medicine,,"Alter, M.J.; Kruszon-Moran, D.; Nainan O.V.; McQuillan, G.M.; Gao, F.; Moyer, L.A.; Kaslow, R.A.; Margolis, H.S.",National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention,1999,Scholarly Journal,10.1056/NEJM199908193410802,0028-4793,"Background Because many persons with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are asymptomatic, population-based serologic studies are needed to estimate the prevalence of the infection and to develop and evaluate prevention efforts. Methods We performed tests for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) on serum samples from 21,241 persons six years old or older who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted during 1988 through 1994. We determined the prevalence of HCV RNA by means of nucleic acid amplification and the genotype by means of sequencing. Results The overall prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.8 percent, corresponding to an estimated 3.9 million persons nationwide (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 million to 4.8 million) with HCV infection. Sixty-five percent of the persons with HCV infection were 30 to 49 years old. Seventy-four percent were positive for HCV RNA, indicating that an estimated 2.7 million persons in the United States (95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 million to 3.0 million) were chronically infected, of whom 73.7 percent were infected with genotype 1 (56.7 percent with genotype la, and 17.0 percent with genotype Ib). Among subjects 17 to 59 years of age, the strongest factors independently associated with HCV infection were illegal drug use and high-risk sexual behavior. Other factors independently associated with infection included poverty, having had 12 or fewer years of education, and having been divorced or separated. Neither sex nor racial-ethnic group was independently associated with HCV infection. Conclusions In the United States, about 2.7 million persons are chronically infected with HCV. People who use illegal drugs or engage in high-risk sexual behavior account for most persons with HCV infection. (N Engl J Med 1999;341:556-62.)

Each exposure's contribution to VaR is portfolio-invariant only if (a) dependence across exposures is driven by a single systematic risk factor, and (b) no exposure accounts for more than an arbitrarily small share of total portfolio exposure. Analysis of rates of convergence to asymptotic VaR leads to a simple and accurate portfolio-level add-on charge for undiversified idiosyncratic risk. There is no similarly simple way to address violation of the single factor assumption. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Practitioners and policy makers have invested in implementing and exploring a variety of new models individually. Less progress has been made, however, with comparative analyses. Direct comparison often is not straightforward, because the different models may be presented within rather different mathematical frameworks. This paper offers a comparative anatomy of two especially influential benchmarks for credit risk models, the RiskMetrics Group's CreditMetrics and Credit Suisse Financial Product's CreditRisk+. We show that, despite differences on the surface, the underlying mathematical structures are similar. The structural parallels provide intuition for the relationship between the two models and allow us to describe quite precisely where the models differ in functional form, distributional assumptions, and reliance on approximation formulae. We then design simulation exercises which evaluate the effect of each of these differences individually. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Reported estimates of the VSL vary substantially, from less than $100,000 to more than $25 million. This research uses meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VSL literature. Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL estimates and each study particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million (ill 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when ""best practice"" assumptions are invoked. This range is considerably below many previous qualitative reviews of this literature.
