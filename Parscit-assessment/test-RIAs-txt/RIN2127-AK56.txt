1 Survey of manufacturers indicated that all large school buses already have lap/shoulder belts voluntarily 
installed for drivers. The lap/shoulder option for the driver seat of motorcoaches is becoming increasingly 
popular in recent years accounting for 40 percent of new motorcoach orders. 
 One source of uncertainty in our estimates is the effectiveness of seat belts in preventing 
fatalities and injuries on motorcoaches.  We assume that motorcoach seat belts will have 
the same effectiveness by crash mode as seat belts in the outboard rear seat of passenger 
cars.  Another source of uncertainty is how widely motorcoach seat belts will be used.  
To deal with this uncertainty, we examined a range of user rates from 15% to 83%.

I. Introduction 
 
Millions of people are transported by motorcoach annually.  These trips include both 
business and pleasure tours and are both intra and inter cities.  Senior citizens and 
students account for the majority of occupants on these trips, approximately 54 percent. 
According to the Motorcoach Census 2008, the motor-coach industry in the United States 
and Canada had approximately 3,400 carriers and 33,536 motorcoaches.  Of this number 
approximately 3,137 carriers and approximately 29,325 motorcoaches were based in the 
United States. 
 
In recent years, there have been several serious motorcoach crashes investigated by the 
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  In each crash there were at least three 
fatalities and six occupants with serious injuries.  The causes of most of the motorcoach 
crashes were attributed to driver error or poor maintenance of the motorcoach.  In many 
of these crashes, the NTSB determined that the risk of passenger fatalities or injuries 
would have been minimized if they had been properly restrained with a lap/shoulder belt.  
The main goal of this rulemaking is to reduce occupant ejection. Ejections account for 
seventy-eight percent of the fatalities in motorcoach rollover crashes and twenty-eight 
percent of the fatalities in non-rollover crashes.  Lap/shoulder belts installed on 
motorcoaches could reduce the risk of fatal injuries in rollover crashes by 77 percent. 
  
Alternatives are considered in Chapter X.  These alternatives include requiring a lap belt 
to be installed for motorcoach passengers and examining the ECE-R14 test requirement, 
which is less stringent than proposed.  Lap belt test results, benefits and costs are 
discussed in the appropriate chapters and combined in Chapter X.   
 
 
The Definition of a Motorcoach 
 
The agency proposes to amend 49 CFR Part 571.3 to: 
Define a motorcoach as “a bus with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 11,793 kg 
(26,000 pounds) or greater, 16 or more designated seating positions, and at least 2 rows 
of passenger seats that are forward facing or can convert to forward facing without the 
use of tools.  Motorcoach does not include a school bus, multifunction school activity  
bus, or transit bus designed for an “urban area” as defined in 49 U.S.C. Section 
5301(16).” 
 
There are various other definitions of a motorcoach.  One definition from the Motorcoach 
Census 2008 describes a motorcoach as bus designed for long-distance transportation of 
passengers, characterized by integral construction with an elevated passenger deck 
located over a baggage compartment.  It is as least 35 feet in length with a capacity of 
more than 30 passengers. This definition of motorcoach excludes the typical city transit 
2 
bus, which is designed for urban and suburban routes, and city sightseeing buses, such as 
double-decker buses and trolleys.2

II. Background 
 
Currently motorcoaches fall under the vehicle category of “bus” and must comply with, 
among other Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, FMVSS No. 108, “Lamps, 
reflective devices, and associated equipment,” FMVSS No. 120, “Tire selection and rims 
and motor home/recreation vehicle trailer load carrying capacity information for motor 
vehicles with a GVWR of more than 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds),” FMVSS No. 
121, “Air brake systems,” FMVSS No. 208, “Occupant crash protection,” FMVSS No. 
209, “Seat belt assemblies,” FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly anchorages,” FMVSS 
No. 217, “Bus emergency exits and window retention and release,” and FMVSS No. 302, 
“Flammability of interior materials,” among other FMVSSs that apply to buses with a 
GVWR greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 pounds).  FMVSS Nos. 208 and 210 presently 
apply to the driver’s seat only. 
 
FMVSS No. 208 requires either Type 1 or Type 2 seat belts for the driver-seating 
position in all buses.  A Type 1 seat belt assembly is a lap belt for pelvic restraint.  A 
Type 2 seat belt assembly is a combination of pelvic and upper torso restraints (a 
lap/shoulder belt).  There is currently no requirement for seat belts to be installed at the 
passenger seating positions in buses.   
 
 
 
 Motorcoach Passenger Seating Positions 
 
There are currently no federal requirements for seat belts to be installed in the passenger 
positions for motorcoach type buses.  Recently, some manufacturers have begun to 
voluntarily install seat belts in their motorcoaches, but the vast majority of motorcoaches 
do not have seat belts installed for passenger seating positions aside from restraints for 
wheelchair-bound occupants.  Figure 1 shows the passenger seating systems typically 
installed in motorcoaches.

Existing Motorcoach Passenger Seating Designs with Seat Belts 
 
While belted seats are not currently required for passenger designated seating positions in 
motorcoaches, three motorcoach manufacturers (Prevost, MCI and Bus and Coach 
International (BCI)) have begun voluntarily working with seating suppliers to offer Type 
1 (lap belt) and Type 2 (lap/shoulder belt) seats for passengers.  Some of the motorcoach 
passenger seats (Amaya/FAINSA) are reportedly capable of meeting the performance 
requirements in European regulations and the IMMI Safeguard seats meet the 
performance requirements of FMVSS No. 208, 209, 210, and 222.  Prevost has recently 
begun installing the IMMI Safeguard premier in new motorcoaches  Figure 2 shows 
passenger seats for use in a motorcoach with integrated Type 2 seat belts.  The number of 
seats produced by these manufacturers is very small relative to the number of seats on 
motorcoaches.

III. The Proposed Rule  
 
This rulemaking is going to change the existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 
(FMVSS) to regulate installation of lap/shoulder belts for drivers of motorcoaches and 
other types of large buses, and proposes lap/shoulder belts for passenger occupants of 
motorcoaches.  An alternative examined in this analysis is for lap belts for passenger 
occupants of motorcoaches.    
 
The agency proposes to amend FMVSS No. 208, “Occupant Crash Protection,” to:   
 
require lap/shoulder belts at all driver and passenger seating positions of motorcoaches;  
 
require lap/shoulder belts at all driver seating positions for all buses with a gross vehicle 
weight (GVWR) greater than 4,536 kg (10,000 pounds); and  
 
require lap/shoulder belts at all locations to meet FMVSS No. 210, “Seat belt assembly 
anchorages,” which requires that a seat belt anchorage be of sufficient strength to with 
stand loads of 13,345 N (3,000 pounds) applied to the torso and the lap portion of the 
lap/shoulder belt anchorages.

IV. Research 
NHTSA’s Frontal Crash Protection Research on Motorcoaches 
 
The agency’s objectives for the motorcoach frontal crash protection research program are 
as follows:   
1.  Obtain a motorcoach crash pulse from a severe frontal crash event, 
2. Evaluate alternative occupant crash protection systems in controlled laboratory 
tests, and  
3. Provide results to support rulemaking activities to upgrade the occupant crash 
protection for motorcoach passengers. 
 
To achieve these objectives, the agency conducted a full-scale motorcoach crash test to 
determine a representative crash pulse and completed a series of frontal sled test 
simulations to evaluate passenger occupant protection systems.  The following sections 
describe the research and its findings. 
 
Full Scale Motorcoach Crash Test 
 
A 48.3 km/h (30 mph) full frontal rigid barrier crash test was conducted with a 
motorcoach in December 2007 at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC).  The 
vehicle used for the test was a 45 foot long, 2000 model year, MCI 102EL3 Renaissance 
motorcoach with 54 passenger seats (Figure IV-1).  The total tested weight of the vehicle, 
including dummies and equipment, was 19,377 kg (42,720 lbs).   
 
Figure IV-1:  Pre-test Photo of Full-Scale Rigid Barrier Crash Test 
 
Twenty-two test dummies were used during the test to generate preliminary data on 
injury risk for various seating conditions.  The test dummies4
                                                 
4 The crash test dummies used in this program have limitations in that they are constructed with a fixed 
pelvis.  This design does not allow the hips to fully articulate when the dummy strikes the seat back directly 
in front of it. 
 included:  the 5th percentile 
 
7 
female Hybrid III dummy, the 50th percentile male Hybrid III dummy and the 95th 
percentile male Hybrid III dummy.   The dummies were seated in an upright 
configuration see Figure IV-2.  There are currently no specific seating procedures for 
positioning dummies in motorcoach seats, as there are for FMVSS No. 208 or other 
standards that utilize crash test dummies. 
 
Figure IV-2:  Pre-test Photo of Motorcoach Interior 
 
Figure IV-3 is a post-test picture of the motorcoach exterior after the crash test.  As 
shown in the photo, the motorcoach underwent extensive front-end damage and resulted 
in 1.98 meters (6.5 feet) of crush in the 30mph test.   
 
Figure IV-3:  Post-crash Photo of Motorcoach Exterior 
The primary purpose of this test was to obtain the deceleration profile (crash pulse) for 
use in simulated sled tests.  The crash test resulted in a peak deceleration of 10 Gs at 125 
msec.  A detailed discussion of the crash pulse will be presented in the sled test section 
8 
below.  In addition, the restraint performance of several seating types and dummy seating 
configurations were examined during the crash test.  Observations from the crash test 
indicated that all belted dummies remained securely fastened in their seats.  The unbelted 
dummies in the crash test did not stay within the seating row in which they were placed 
prior to the crash test, and came to rest either in the aisle, on the floor, or in the seating 
row directly in front (see Figure IV-4).   
 
 
Figure IV-4:  Post-crash Photo of Motorcoach Interior 
 
For these tests, the following dummy injury criteria were measured during the full scale 
crash tests:  HIC15, Nij, Chest Gs, Chest deflection, and Maximum Femur Compression.5
Table IV-1:  Injury Assessment Reference Values 
  
Table IV-1 shows the Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV) for each of the injury 
criteria measured.  For each dummy, the injury measures were calculated as specified in 
FMVSS No. 208. 
Dummy Size HIC15 Nij Chest (g) Chest (mm) Femur (N) 
5th Percentile Female 700 1.00 60 52 6,800 
50th Percentile Male 700 1.00 60 63 10,000 
95th Percentile Male 700 1.00 55 70 12,700 
 
                                                 
5 HIC15, Chest G, and Nij values are used to predict injury risk in frontal crashes.  HIC15 is a measure of 
the risk of head injury, Chest G is a measure of chest injury risk, and Nij is a measure of neck injury risk.  
The reference values for these measurements are the thresholds for compliance used to assess new motor 
vehicles with regard to frontal occupant protection during crash tests in FMVSS No. 208.  For HIC15, a 
score of 700 is equivalent to a 30 percent risk of a serious head injury (skull fracture).  Similarly, a Chest G 
of 60 equates to a 20 percent risk of a serious chest injury and a Nij of 1 equates to a 22 percent risk of a 
serious neck injury.  For all these measurements, higher scores indicate a higher likelihood of risk.  For 
example, a Nij of 2 equates to a 67 percent risk of serious neck injury while a Nij of 4 equates to a 99 
percent risk.  More information regarding these injury measures can be found at NHTSA's web site 
(http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-11/airbags/rev_criteria.pdf). 
9 
Figure IV-5 presents the HIC15 and Nij injury measures for the various dummy 
positions.  Chest Gs, chest deflection and femur forces were low for all dummies and are 
not presented in the figure. 
 
The unbelted dummies and lap belted dummies generally exhibited higher injury values 
than dummies secured with lap/shoulder belts.  The unbelted dummies seated next to the 
aisle ended up on the floor in the aisle.  The dummies secured with lap/shoulder belts 
generally stayed in their seats and exhibited the lowest injury values during the crash test. 
 
10 
 
11 
Accelerometers were positioned along the center aisle and at the driver seat of the 
motorcoach to record decelerations during the crash.  These deceleration time histories 
were filtered to 30 Hz to give a relatively smooth trace that can be replicated with the 
sled.  Using these data as a reference, NHTSA developed a metering pin which was used 
to control the deceleration of the HYGE sled and simulate the full frontal crash test pulse.   
 
Frontal Sled Tests 
General Overview of Methodology 
 
Twenty sled tests were then conducted to further study the performance of various 
seating system configurations available for use on motorcoaches for different sized 
occupants, as well as establish data for comparison with other international standards.  
Several seating configurations from the full scale motorcoach crash test were also 
simulated in the sled tests to observe any trends in the dummy injury values.  The sled 
tests were engineered to replicate the deceleration time history of the motorcoach full-
scale frontal impact crash test.  The goal of the sled tests was to analyze the dummy 
injury measures to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of the 
countermeasures.  In addition to injury measures, dummy kinematics were also analyzed 
to identify the important factors contributing to the type, mechanism, and potential 
severity of any resulting injury. 
 
 
 
Sled Buck Description 
 
To evaluate motorcoach safety restraint systems, a sled buck was constructed of three 
rows of motorcoach seats, each containing two seating positions.  Each row had a seating 
configuration that represented an aisle and window position.  The seats were separated by 
a distance of 34 inches between seats.  This corresponded to an average value measured 
on the full scale motorcoach that was crash tested.6
                                                 
6 VRTC selected 34 inch spacing after verifying the amount with seat manufacturers and MCI as a good 
middle value.  Since the seats are infinitely adjustable, it is usually up to the fleet operators to install the 
seats wherever they want.  The typical distance between them varies a lot.  For example, they are closest 
together in Hawaii to accommodate more tourists.  VRTC verified that the 95th percentile dummy would fit 
at 34” pitch between seats before selecting it. 
  Motorcoach side walls were not 
constructed for the tests.  Seating systems were readily detached from the floor of the sled 
and interchanged for the various test configurations, as discussed in the next section.  For 
the angled sled tests, the sled buck was oriented with a 15-degree offset (see Figure IV-
6).   
12 
 
Figure IV-6:  15-Degree Offset Sled Test Configuration Set-up 
Sled Test Pulse 
Of the twenty sled tests in this program, fifteen were conducted using a crash pulse 
representative of the full scale crash test performed at VRTC.  (This crash pulse is 
referred to as the “VRTC pulse”).  The five remaining sled tests were performed using 
the crash pulse specified in ECE Regulation 80.  This crash pulse is used in Europe for 
testing motorcoach seats and anchorages used in the European market.  The ECE 
Regulation 80 crash pulse is referred to as the “EU pulse.”  A comparison of the full scale 
crash test pulse, the VRTC pulse, and the specification limits of the EU pulse are shown 
in Figure IV-7.  The sled test replicates the full-scale crash test pulse reasonably well.  
We note that the EU pulse has a higher peak acceleration and a duration approximately 
half that measured during the full scale crash test. 
13 
 
Figure IV-7 Crash Test and Sled Test Pulses 
Sled Test Matrix 
 
Twenty sled tests were performed using eleven test configurations of ATDs, seats and 
crash pulses.7
 
  The sled test buck consisted of three rows of seats.  The left side of the 
buck represented aisle seating, and the right side represented window seating.  The test 
matrix is presented in Table IV-2.  The four test conditions highlighted in light green 
replicated seating configurations examined in the full scale crash test.  For these tests, the 
same dummy injury criteria measured during the full scale crash test were measured 
during the sled tests. 
Eighteen of the sled tests were performed in a 0-degree full-frontal configuration.  Two 
of the sled tests were performed in an oblique configuration with the axis of the sled 
oriented 15 degrees off the axis of the crash pulse.  One of the eighteen 0-degree full 
frontal sled tests was conducted with the front and middle seats in the fully reclined 
position.  The rest were conducted with the seats close to upright.  The seat back angle 
was determined by having the head level. 
 
The seat restraint types in the 20 sled tests included:  unbelted seats (most commonly 
installed on U.S. motorcoaches), seats with lap belts, seats with lap/shoulder belts 
                                                 
7 See Docket No. NHTSA-2007-28793 for the raw data and IARV measures from the sled tests.

(including those rated in the EU for 7G and 10G test loads).8
                                                 
8 These seat ratings refer to ECE Regulation 14 and TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.1/Amend2.  ECE Regulation 
14 applies to vehicles “having at least 4 wheels and used for the carriage of passengers,” and having more 
than 8 seats plus the driver with a mass exceeding 5 tonnes (11,023 lbs).  Seats which conform to test loads 
equivalent to 6.6g are referred to as “7G seats.”  Seats which conform to test loads equivalent to 10g are 
referred to as “10G seats.”  Unbelted seats are typically rated as 7G.  Both Type 1 and Type 2 belted seats 
are rated as either 7G or 10G. 
  As shown in Table IV-2, all 
seats used in the sled test program were either:  American (Amer) seats, Amaya seats or 
Amaya/FAINSA seats.  The American seats and Amaya 7G seats were used to represent 
the unbelted configuration.  The Amaya/FAINSA seats were used to represent lap or 
lap/shoulder belt configurations.

Analysis Methods 
 
The kinematics and dummy injury measurements from the 20 sled tests are summarized.  
On a high level, it focuses on the three different restraint strategies evaluated in the sled 
tests: 
1)  Unbelted sled tests; 
2)  Lap belted sled tests; and  
3)  Lap/shoulder belted sled tests. 
Within the context of these restraint strategies, various tests conditions were evaluated: 
1)  Loading from other dummy occupants 
a) Rear occupant loading – Dummies in the seat behind affecting the loading 
of the kinematics of a dummy seated in front. 
b) Forward seat back preloading – Lap/shoulder belted dummies in the seat in 
front. 
2)  Seat type 
3)  Sled pulse (VRTC vs. EU, 15-degree angled configuration) 
4)  Reclined seat 
 
In the analysis below, the discussion is primarily focused on HIC and Nij injury 
measurements since the dummy chest deflections, chest Gs, and femur compression loads 
were generally below 80 percent of the IARV.  For each restraint type, the injury data are 
averaged together, as well as averaged individually for each dummy size.  In addition, the 
data are broken down to compare specific test parameters such as rear occupant loading, 
seat type, sled pulse, etc.  For these comparisons, typically only one parameter is varied 
at a time. 
 
95th Percentile Male and 5th Percentile Female Dummy 
Kinematics 
 
The following description pertains to unrestrained 95th percentile male and 5th percentile 
female dummies as observed in Test Configuration 6.  In this sled test configuration, 
unbelted 95th percentile male dummies were positioned in the middle row and unbelted 
17 
5th percentile female dummies were positioned in the rear row.  The findings below were 
valid regardless of any interaction with rearward seated dummies or seat back 
deformation caused by a rearward dummy.  Any interaction with rear seated dummies 
occurred after the forward dummies’ motion was essentially complete.   
 
Figure IV-8 shows a filmstrip of the dummy kinematics from this test.  With the onset of 
the test, the dummies slide forward in the seat, remaining in an upright-seated position 
until the knees of the dummies strike the seat back in front of it.  At this point, the 
dummies’ upper torsos begin to rotate forward and downward.  The 95th percentile male 
dummies’ knees deformed the seat back directly in front, which resulted in a later contact 
between the dummies’ heads and the seat backs in front.  The aisle-seated dummy 
resulted in greater deformation to the seat back directly in front due to the way the seat 
was anchored.  As shown in the last two film clips, the dummies were ejected out of their 
seating positions. 
 
Figure IV-8:  Unbelted Sled Test – 95th Percentile Male Dummy 
 
While the 5th percentile female dummies had the same general kinematics as the 95th 
percentile dummies, the knees of the 5th percentile female dummies in the rear row did 
18 
not deform the middle row seat back as much.  Consequently, the dummies had a much 
more severe head contact with the seat back directly in front. 
 
At the end of the test, the aisle-seated dummies ended up in the aisle.  The window-seated 
95th percentile male dummy ended up in the front row while the 5th percentile female 
dummy ended up rebounding back into her initial seat.  This discrepancy in kinematics 
between the aisle and window-seated dummies was due to the different amounts of 
deformation of the seat back directly in front of the dummies. 
 
50th Percentile Male and 5th Percentile Female Dummy 
Kinematics 
 
The following description pertains to unrestrained 50th percentile male and 5th percentile 
female dummies as observed in Test Configuration 7.  In this unbelted sled test, unbelted 
50th percentile male dummies were positioned in the aisle seats (middle and rear rows) 
and unbelted 5th percentile female dummies were positioned in the window seats (middle 
and rear rows).  As in the previous section, the findings below were valid regardless of 
any interaction with rearward seated dummies or seat back deformation caused by a 
rearward dummy.  Any interaction with rear seated dummies occurred after the forward 
dummies’ motion was essentially complete.   
 
Figures IV-9 and IV-10 provide filmstrip9
 
 illustrations of the dummy kinematics from 
this test series (for the 50th percentile male dummy and 5th percentile female dummy, 
respectively).  In this particular test, the front row seats were Amaya/FAINSA 7G seats 
which have a stiffer seat back than the standard American type seats.  With the onset of 
the test, the dummies slide forward in the seat, remaining in an upright-seated position 
until the knees of the dummies strike the seat back in front of it.  At this point, the 
dummies’ upper torsos begin to rotate forward and downward.   
Since the rear row dummies interacted with the standard American seat and the middle 
row dummies interacted with the stiffer (front row) seats, the middle row occupants 
resulted in higher neck extension than the rear row dummies when making contact.  As 
seen in the prior test series, the 50th percentile male dummy in the rear row provided 
more knee-imparted deformation to the seat in front resulting in later head contact with 
the seat back than the adjacent 5th percentile female dummy. 
 
Unlike the previous test configuration with American seats, the aisle-seated dummies did 
not end up in the aisle at the end of the test.  They were positioned in their original 
seating locations at final rest.

Injury Measures 
 
Table IV-3 highlights the average injury measurements from three sled tests conducted 
with unrestrained dummies.  The discussion that follows is primarily focused on HIC15 
and Nij injury measurements since the dummy chest deflections, chest Gs, and femur 
loads were generally below 80 percent of the IARV.  The cells of the table are color-
coded to indicate whether they are below 80 percent of the IARV (green), 80 to 100 
percent of the IARV (yellow), or greater than 100 percent of the IARV (red).  This color 
code is used throughout the analysis.  The measurements are presented as averages across 
all dummy sizes as well as separated by dummy size.  The data encompass multiple test 
conditions, including rear unbelted occupant loading and seat type.  The VRTC crash 
pulse was used for all the tests.

Figure IV-11 is a graph of all averaged values normalized by the appropriate IARV.  In 
the sled test, all of the dummy measurements were below the IARV’s,  only the 5th 
percentile female dummy average injury measures were notably elevated in these tests 
due to the dummies shorter stature and relatively quick forward head contact with the 
seats in front (due to the lack of knee deformation against the seat back in front).  This 
was consistent with the unbelted 5th percentile dummy performance in the full scale crash 
test where a HIC15 of 1959 resulted.  The injury measures for the 50th and 95th percentile 
male dummies were also elevated in the full scale crash test, but not as high.  In the sled 
tests, the larger dummies, the 50th and 95th percentile male dummies provided more 
deformation to the seat back in front and resulted in average injury measures below 80 
percent of the IARV.  It should be noted that these dummies are frontal crash test 
dummies, and hence the injury measures may not accurately capture the severity of 
loading during interaction with interior components when the dummy falls off the seat 
(see kinematics section above).  The sections that follow break down the results in more 
detail (relative to specific test parameters).

Loading from the Rear by Unrestrained Dummies 
 
In the unbelted test series (Test Configurations 6, 7, and 7b), all the dummies in the 
middle row of the sled were subject to impact by another unbelted dummy behind them.  
The front row of the sled was empty.  Table 3.2.4 compares the average dummy readings 
of middle row to the rear.  The unbelted dummies in the rear row had higher average 
injury values than the dummies positioned in the middle row that were impacted by an 
unbelted dummy from the rear.  Again, the 5th percentile female dummy had high injury 
measurements, while the 50th percentile male dummies were below 80 percent of the 
IARVs.

Seat Back Type in Front of Unbelted Occupant 
 
In the unbelted test series, four different seat back types were impacted by the unbelted 
dummy occupants.  The seats included:  American, Amaya/FAINSA, Amaya 7G and 
Amaya 10G.  Table IV-5 separates the unbelted dummy injury measures by the type of 
seat the dummy impacted.  The results show that the 5th percentile female dummy injury 
measures were most influenced by the seat back in front of the dummy.  In three out of 
four seat back types, the 5th percentile female dummy had high average injury values.  
The American and Amaya/FAINSA types generated the highest injury readings amongst 
the dummy readings.  The injury measurements for the 50th percentile male and 95th 
percentile male were less influenced by the seat backs they struck.  Impacting the Amaya 
10G seat back was a slight improvement over the Amaya 7G seat back for both the 5th 
percentile female and 50th percentile male dummies.  In the sled test using Amaya 10G 
seats in the first row and Amaya 7G seats in the second row, all but one of the occupant 
injury numbers was below 80 percent of the IARVs for the unbelted dummies.

Lap Belt Sled Tests 
Dummy Kinematics 
The following description pertains to lap belt restrained 5th percentile female and 50th 
percentile male dummies as observed in sled Test Configuration 5.  In this sled test 
configuration, a lap belted 50th percentile male dummy was positioned in the aisle seat 
and a lap belted 5th percentile female dummy in the window seat.   Figure IV-12 provides 
a filmstrip10
 
 illustration of the dummy kinematics from this test series.  The 5th percentile 
female and the 50th percentile male dummies have the same general kinematics.  The 
differences were mainly found in the time and location of interaction between the 
dummy’s head and seat back.   
The kinematics for a lap belt restrained passenger begins in a similar fashion to that of an 
unbelted passenger.  With the onset of the test, the dummies slide forward in the seat, 
remaining in an upright-seated position until all the slack and/or stretch in the belt 
webbings are removed, and/or the knees of the dummies strike the seat back in front of it.  
At this point, the dummies’ upper torsos begin to rotate forward and downward.  Since 
the lap belts helped in reducing the femur loads on the dummies, it did not force the seat 
backs directly in front to deform quite as much.  Therefore, the dummies’ heads 
contacted the seat backs at an earlier time, when they were more upright.  This resulted in 
significant neck extension in the dummies. 
 
As shown in Figure IV-12, the lap belt successfully maintained the dummies within their 
initial seat position.  However, the extent, timing, and location of occupant head 
interaction were a function of other parameters, such as occupant size.  As discussed in 
the next section, the dummy injury measurements were very high in this test condition.

Figure IV-12:  Lap Belted Sled Test – 50th Percentile Male Dummy 
Injury Measures 
 
Table IV-6 highlights the average injury measurements from two sled tests conducted 
with lap belted 5th percentile female and 50th percentile male dummies.  Two crash pulses 
were utilized in these sled tests:  the VRTC pulse and the EU pulse.   Both tests were 
conducted with 7G seats and no rear occupants.  Table IV-6 shows that the average 
dummy response in the lap belted sled tests.  In every instance, the dummies exceeded 
the head and neck IARVs when the dummies were lap belted.  This was consistent with 
the full scale crash test that resulted in a HIC15 value of 785 for the 50th percentile male 
dummy and 1,356 for the 5th percentile female dummy.  Unlike the unbelted test series 
and the crash test, however, the 50th percentile male dummy had slightly higher average 
readings than the 5th percentile female dummy.

Effect of Sled Pulse Type 
 
Since there were only two lap belted sled tests conducted, one using the VRTC pulse, and 
the other using the EU pulse, Table IV-7 separates the lap belted sled test data by crash 
pulse.  Both the VRTC and EU pulse resulted in high injury numbers in both dummies 
when lap belts were used.  However, the EU pulse resulted in higher average injury 
measurements.  The 50th percentile male dummy, in particular, resulted in injury 
measurements in the EU sled test that were approximately twice as much as the VRTC 
pulse.

Lap/Shoulder Belt Sled Tests 
Kinematics (without Rear Occupant Loading) 
 
The following description pertains to lap/shoulder belt restrained 50th percentile male 
dummies without rear loading from unbelted occupants in the third row of Test 
Configuration 3, though similar observations were made with the 5th percentile female 
dummy (Test Configuration 4).  In the sled tests (Test Configuration 3), two 50th 
percentile male dummies restrained by lap/shoulder belts were positioned in the middle 
row and no dummies were seated rearward.  Figure IV-14 provides a filmstrip11
 
 
illustration of the dummy kinematics from this test series.  With the onset of the test, the 
dummies slide forward in the seat, remaining in an upright-seated position until all the 
slack and/or stretch in the belt webbing is removed, and/or the knees of the dummies 
strike the seat back in front of it.  At this point, the dummies’ upper torsos begin to rotate 
forward and downward; however, the lap/shoulder belt minimizes and restrains the 
motion of the upper torsos and prevents the dummies from contacting the seats in front.  
The fact that the dummy does not contact the seat in front is due to the dummy sitting 
height, the seat spacing and the lack of seat deformation due to an unbelted rear occupant.  
Upon rebound, the torsos of the dummies move upwards and backwards towards the seat.  
The dummies then slide rearward in a more upright-seated position.  The lap/shoulder 
belts successfully maintained the dummies in their original seating position.

the seat, remaining in an upright-seated position until all the slack and/or stretch in the 
belt webbing is removed, and/or the knees of the dummies strike the seat back in front of 
it.  At this point, the unbelted dummies in the rear have effectively the same kinematics 
as the lap/shoulder belted dummies in the middle row.  However, as the dummies’ upper 
torsos begin to rotate forward and downward, the lap/shoulder belts begin restraining the 
middle row dummies, whereas the rear unbelted dummies impact the middle row seat 
back with their heads.  The dual loading applied to the middle row seat (from restraining 
the middle row belted dummies and being impacted from unbelted dummies from the 
13 Reference:  Sled Test Configuration 2, Test 5. 
28 
rear row) significantly deformed the middle row seats and consequently moved the 
lap/shoulder belted dummies closer to the front row seat backs, where contact was made.  
Upon rebound, the torsos of the lap/shoulder belted dummies move upwards and 
backwards towards the seat.  The lap/shoulder belt successfully maintained the dummies 
in their original seating position.  The unbelted dummies in the rear row rebounded back 
towards their seat with the aisle-seated dummy lying in the aisle.

Injury Measures 
Table IV-8 highlights the average injury measurements from twelve sled tests conducted 
with 5th percentile female and 50th and 95th percentile male dummies restrained by 
lap/shoulder belts.  Two crash pulses were utilized in these sled tests:  the VRTC pulse 
and the EU pulse.  Two different seat types were also utilized:  Amaya/FAINSA 7G and 
10G seats.  Most of the average injury measures were below 80 percent of the IARVs for 
all three occupant sizes.  This was consistent with the lap/shoulder belt results from the 
full scale motorcoach crash test.  The 5th percentile female had the lowest HIC15 injury 
29 
measurements of the three dummies and the 50th percentile male dummy had the highest 
average HIC15 of 595.  As discussed further below, the 50th percentile male dummy had 
two very high HIC15 values (1526 and 1733) in two of the tests with the EU pulse.

Effect of Unbelted Rear Seat Occupant 
 
Table IV-9 presents the injury measures for dummy occupants in lap/shoulder belts that 
had an unbelted rear row occupant behind them.  Occupants interacting with each other 
directly or through other seat components have the potential of degrading any restraint 
strategy.  However, nearly all of the average injury measures for the lap/shoulder belted 
dummies with rear seat occupant loading were below 80 percent of the IARVs.  Only the 
HIC15 injury measurement for the 50th percentile male was at an elevated level.

Effect of Pre-loading the Seat 
Table IV-10 provides the results of the unbelted dummies in the rear row that impacted 
lap/shoulder belted occupants in the middle row.  In this scenario, the seats in front of the 
unbelted dummies are considered to be “pre-loaded” (with belted occupants) for the 
purposes of this discussion.  All dummies that impacted the pre-loaded seats were 50th 
percentile male or 95th percentile male dummies and their average injury measures were 
all below 80 percent of the IARVs.

There was not much variation when separating the data by sled test pulse (EU vs. 
VRTC).  The average EU pulse response was:  HIC15 = 511 and Nij = 0.63, and the 
average VRTC pulse response was:  HIC15 = 423 and Nij = 0.57.  Additionally, there 
was not much variation when separating the data by the type of seat impacted (7G vs. 
10G seats). The average dummy response when impacting the 7G seat was:  HIC15 = 463 
and Nij = 0.58, and the average dummy response when impacting the 10G seat was:  
HIC15 = 407 and Nij = 0.59. 
 
Effect of Lap/Shoulder Belt-Equipped Seat Type 
 
Table IV-11 separates the sled test data by the type of lap/shoulder belt-equipped seat 
used by the subject dummy.  For these tests, all the lap/shoulder belt seats were 
Amaya/FAINSA and were either classified as 7G or 10G seats.  Based on the sled test 
results, the 10G seats generally performed better than the 7G seats across the different 
31 
occupant sizes.  Most of the average injury measures for all three occupant sizes were 
below 80 percent of the IARVs.

Effect of Sled Pulse 
 
Table IV-12 separates the lap/shoulder belt sled test data by whether the VRTC or EU 
pulse was used.  Based on the sled test results, the larger dummies had considerably 
higher injury measures in the sled tests with the EU pulse than with the VRTC pulse. The 
HIC15 injury measurements for the 50th and 95th percentile male dummies were at 
elevated levels. The stiffer EU pulse resulted in the 50th and 95th percentile male dummies 
causing more deformation to the middle row seat and causing the dummies to contact the 
seat backs directly below the headrest.  When subjected to the VRTC crash pulse, the 
head contact was made to the front row headrest.  The lap/shoulder belted 5th percentile 
female dummy injury measures were relatively low for both crash pulse types because 
she is not tall enough to make contact with the front row seat back even with the stiffer 
EU crash pulse.  In the tests conducted with the VRTC pulse, all of the average injury 
measures for all three occupant sizes were below 80 percent of the IARVs.

Effect of Recline Position 
 
In addition to the lap/shoulder belted sled tests conducted above (in an upright condition), 
one sled test was conducted with the lap/shoulder belted dummies seated in a reclined 
32 
seat back position, with the front row seats also in a reclined seat back position and the 
rear row seats in an upright position.  Table IV-13 presents the average results from the 
lap/shoulder belted dummies in a reclined seating position as well as the average results 
for the unbelted dummies seated behind the dummies in the reclined seats.  The test was 
conducted with the VRTC pulse and 7G seats.  The average injury values were all below 
80 percent of the IARVs for all cases.

3.2.2.4.8 15-Degree Sled Tests 
 
In addition to the lap/shoulder belt sled tests conducted above, two sled tests were 
conducted in an off-axis orientation.  In one test, the middle row dummies were unbelted.  
In the other test, the middle row dummies were restrained by lap/shoulder belts.  Both 
tests were conducted with the VRTC pulse and 7G seats.  In each test, unbelted dummies 
were positioned in the rear row. 
 
Table IV-14 presents the average dummy results for the middle row occupants.  The 
middle row dummies restrained by lap/shoulder belts had lower HIC 15 and Nij 
measurements compared to the unbelted dummies.  However, all the injury measures 
were very low.  The dummies restrained by lap/shoulder belts maintained their seating 
positions, however, the unbelted 5th percentile female dummy was ejected from her seat 
into the aisle, and the unbelted 50th percentile male dummy came to rest in the seat next 
to his original position.

Table IV-15 presents the average results of the unbelted dummies in the rear row in the 
15-degree sled tests.  The unbelted occupants behind the middle row seats with 
lap/shoulder belted occupants were considered “pre-loaded.”  Most of the injury 
measures for the rear row unbelted occupants were also below 80 percent of the IARVs.  
However, like the middle row dummies, the unbelted 5th percentile female dummies were 
ejected from their seat into the aisle.  Also, in one test, the unbelted 50th percentile male 
dummy resulted in high HIC15 and Nij measurements from contacting the upper d-ring 
for the lap/shoulder belt seat in the middle row.

Discussion 
Relative Performance of Each Restraint Strategy 
 
Figure IV-17 compares the average HIC15 and Nij values for the 5th percentile female 
and 50th percentile male dummy sizes in the sled testing as a means to compare the 
relative performance of each restraint strategy (unbelted, lap belts, and lap/shoulder 
belts).   The comparative data was restricted to dummies that were not loaded from the 
rear by unbelted occupants and to sled tests conducted with the VRTC pulse.  The 
limitations were made since the number of sled tests conducted with lap belt restraints 
was limited for comparative purposes.  No lap belted tests were conducted with unbelted 
occupants in the rear, no lap belted tests utilized the EU pulse and none were conducted 
with the 95th percentile male dummy.  Therefore, the graph only presents the average 
normalized injury measures for the 5th percentile female and 50th percentile male 
dummies. 
34 
 
Figure IV-17:  Restraint Comparison – Average Normalized Injury Measurements   
 
Figure IV-17 shows that the lowest average HIC and Nij values were associated with the 
lap/shoulder belt restraint for both dummy sizes.  In contrast, most of the average injury 
measures for the lap belt restraint condition were at or above the IARVs.  The low HIC15 
and Nij values for the lap/shoulder restraint condition are consistent with the dummy 
kinematics, which indicated that the lap/shoulder belt restraint limited head contact with 
the forward seat back, particularly for the 5th percentile female dummies.  The unbelted 
dummies were more susceptible to hitting other hard structures or being displaced from 
their seats. 
 
Since a lap belted sled test for the 95th percentile male dummy was not conducted, Figure 
IV-18 plots the average HIC15 and Nij values for the 95th percentile male dummy in the 
unbelted and lap/shoulder belt sled tests.  Based on the available data, the comparison 
was limited to 7G seats and the VRTC pulse.  The dummies were also loaded from the 
rear by unbelted occupants.

Figure IV-18:  95th Dummy Restraint Comparison – Average Normalized Injury 
Measurements   
 
As with the 5th percentile female and 50th percentile male dummies, Figure IV-18 shows 
that the lowest average HIC and Nij values for the 95th percentile male dummy were 
associated with the lap/shoulder belt restraint.  It should be noted that this was a very 
positive outcome for the lap/shoulder belt restraint condition considering the fact that the 
lap/shoulder belt sled test had unbelted 95th percentile male dummies loading the seat 
from the rear, whereas, the unbelted tests had only 5th percentile female dummies.  While 
the injury measures were below 80 percent of the IARV in both the unbelted and 
lap/shoulder belt test conditions, the lap/shoulder belt restrained dummies had better 
kinematics and were better controlled in their seats. 
 
Effect of Loading Boundary Conditions 
 
The sled testing was conducted using a sled buck capable of simulating multiple rows of 
seats to better understand how unbelted rear occupants interact with a particular seat and 
whether this resulted in any degradation of the restraint strategy.  Most of the sled tests 
were conducted with unbelted dummies positioned in the rear row. 
 
Preloading of Forward Seat Back 
 
The sled testing attempted to determine if occupants restrained by lap/shoulder belts, 
seated in positions in front of unbelted occupants, degraded the unbelted occupant 
protection.  The 50th percentile male was the only dummy size that was tested with and

without “preloading” of the seat back in front by a lap/shoulder belted dummy.  The 
results showed that there was little difference when comparing the average injury 
measures of the unbelted dummies that impacted a pre-loaded seat (HIC15 = 417 and Nij 
= 0.63) to those that impacted a seat that was not preloaded (HIC15 = 392 and Nij = 
0.65).  Thus, the average injury measures showed very little sensitivity to the preloaded 
condition. 
 
None of the belted dummies in this study were evaluated with preloading of the forward 
seat back. 
 
Loading from the Rear by Unrestrained Dummies 
 
The sled testing also investigated if unrestrained dummies in the rear row loading the 
middle row lap/shoulder belt-equipped seats would degrade the occupant protection 
provided to the lap/shoulder belted occupant.  Only the belted 5th percentile female and 
the 50th percentile male test dummies were tested with loading from rear unbelted 
dummies.  Table IV-16 compares the average injury measures for lap/shoulder belted 
dummies with and without loading from the rear by an unrestrained dummy.

Based on the results, the lap/shoulder belted occupants that were loaded from the rear had 
slightly higher injury measures than those that did not have rear seat loading.  This was a 
different trend from the unbelted tests where the unbelted occupants in the rear had the 
higher injury measures (see earlier section).  However, nearly all of the average injury 
measures in the lap/shoulder belt sled series were below 80 percent of the IARVs.  Only 
the HIC15 injury measurement for the 50th percentile male was at an elevated level.   
Lap/Shoulder Belt Seat Type 
 
Two types of lap/shoulder-belt seats were evaluated in the sled tests:  Amaya/FAINSA 
7G and 10G seats.  Based on the sled test results, both seats provided superior 
performance over the lap belted and unbelted conditions in the sled tests.  While there 
were fewer tests with the 10G seats, they generally performed slightly better on average 
than the 7G seats across the different occupant sizes. 
37 
 
Sled Pulse (VRTC vs. EU, 15-degree angled configuration) 
 
Two types of crash pulses were used in the sled tests:  the VRTC pulse and the EU pulse.  
The EU pulse was only used in the lap belt and lap/shoulder belt sled tests (not in the 
unbelted tests).  Based on the results, the dummy injury measures were generally higher 
in the sled tests conducted with the EU pulse, particularly for the larger dummy occupant 
sizes.  Even in the lap/shoulder belt tests, the head injury measurements for the 50th and 
95th percentile male dummies were at elevated levels due to head contact with the seat 
back in front (typically below the head rest).  The lap/shoulder belted 5th percentile 
female dummy was not as affected by the EU pulse since the smaller dummy was not tall 
enough to make contact with the front row seat back.  In the tests conducted with the 
VRTC pulse, all of the injury measures for lap/shoulder belted occupants were below 80 
percent of the IARVs.   
 
VRTC also conducted two 15-degree off-axis sled tests in this study using the VRTC 
pulse and 7G seats.  The results showed that the dummies restrained by lap/shoulder belts 
had lower HIC 15 and Nij measurements compared to the unbelted dummies.  However, 
all the injury measures for both tests were very low.  The dummies restrained by 
lap/shoulder belts maintained their seating positions in the 15-degree angled 
configuration, while the unbelted dummies were ejected from their seats into the aisle or 
adjacent seating positions or made contact with the middle row seat belt d-ring anchors.  
 
Unbelted Dummies 
 
• Average head and neck injury measures were typically below 80 percent of the 
IARVs.  Although, it should be noted that the dummies used were frontal crash test 
dummies, and hence the injury measures may not accurately capture the severity of 
loading during interaction with interior components when the dummy falls off the 
seat.   
• Elevated head injury values resulted in tests with the 5th percentile female dummy due 
to the lower contact with the seat back in front.  This observation was consistent in 
the sled tests and full scale crash tests. 
• The 5th percentile female dummy resulted in elevated head injury measures when 
making contact with most of the seat types evaluated. 
• Larger dummies provided more deformation to the seat backs positioned in front of 
them and were less sensitive to the seat back type (including stiffer belted seats). 
• Unbelted dummies were typically ejected out of their seating position and displaced 
into the aisle or adjacent seats.  They were also more susceptible to hitting other hard 
structures. 
• Injury measures did not appear to be adversely affected by rear occupant loading.  
Any interaction with rear seated dummies occurred after the forward dummies’ 
motion was essentially complete. 
 
38 
Lap Belted Dummies 
 
• Head and neck injury measures exceeded the IARVs for all the dummies tested.   
• The poor performance of the lap belt restraint in the sled tests was consistent with the 
lap belt results from the full scale motorcoach crash test. 
• Compared to the unbelted dummies, the dummy’s head typically hit the seat back in 
front at an earlier point in time due to the lap belt restraining forward motion and the 
upper torso pivoting about the lap belt. 
• Seats in front of lap belted dummies were not deformed by the dummies’ femur 
loading, and consequently, not as compliant when struck.   
• Lap belts were able to retain the dummies in their seating position post-test. 
 
Lap/Shoulder Belted Dummies 
 
• Average head and neck injury measures were low for all dummy sizes and below 
those seen in unbelted and lap belted sled tests.  This was consistent with the 
lap/shoulder belt results from the full scale crash test. 
• Lap and shoulder belts retained the dummies in their seating positions and were able 
to mitigate head contact with the seat in front. 
• Rear unbelted occupant loading resulted in additional forward excursion for the 
lap/shoulder belted dummies, and head contact was made with the seat in front in 
some cases.  The resulting average injury measures were still relatively low in most 
cases. 
• All of the unbelted dummies in the rear seats that impacted middle row seats that 
were “preloaded” by belted occupants had low average injury measures that were 
below 80 percent of the IARVs. 
• Both lap/shoulder belt-equipped seat types (7G and 10G) provided good performance 
in the sled tests, with the 10G seats showing some improvement over the 7G seats. 
• The EU pulse was able to generate higher injury numbers in the larger dummies due 
to contact with the seat back in front.  The VRTC pulse resulted in all average injury 
measures to be below 80 percent of the IARVs. 
• Lap and shoulder belted dummies performed better in the sled tests conducted at a 15-
degree angle.  They had lower injury measures and were retained in their seats.  
Unbelted dummies were ejected into the aisle. 
• In the one test where the front and middle row seat backs were reclined, the injury 
measures for the lap belted occupants and the unbelted rear row occupants were all 
below 80 percent of the IARVs.

NHTSA’s Motorcoach Rollover Testing 
 
Seventy eight percent of the fatalities in motorcoach rollover crashes are attributable to 
ejections.  The agency believes that lap/shoulder belts will aid in containing the occupant 
within the vehicle in the event of a crash.  Seat belts are estimated to be 80 percent 
effective14
 
 in preventing fatal injuries in rollover crashes. Since most of the fatalities in 
motorcoach crashes are due to ejections, we believe that seat belts in motorcoaches will 
provide similar protection to the occupants of the motorcoach as belts provide to 
occupants of light vehicles. To improve motorcoach protection in rollover crashes, 
NHTSA’s priorities have been focused on requiring seat belts on motorcoaches, and 
improving the structural integrity of the roof.

V. Target Population 
 
 
The population of interest for this analysis is individuals traveling in motorcoaches which 
accounts for approximately 18.6 annual fatalities and approximately 7,887 annual 
injuries.  The fatality data came from the Fatality Analysis Reporting system (FARS) and 
includes all passengers and drivers in motorcoaches.  The injury data came from the 
General Estimates System (GES). 
 
 
Fatalities 
Table V-1 shows the average number of fatalities that were recorded on motorcoaches 
and transit buses over the period 1999 to 2008

Table V–1a shows that motorcoaches are involved in many different types of crash 
events, with the highest proportion of fatalities occurring in rollover crashes.

Table V-1a presents the crash data by the most harmful event and not the initial point of 
contact because fatalities are better correlated to the most harmful event than it is to the 
initial point of impact.

FARS 1999-2008 data (for the ten years, not the annual average) indicates the following:

In both tables, it is clear that the fatalities were related to ejection.  Therefore, the primary 
purpose of this rulemaking effort is to prevent ejections.  Table V-2b indicates that 
ejections are especially a problem in non-collision rollover events.  
 
 
 
 
Injuries 
The National Automotive Sampling System/General Estimate System (NASS/GES) that 
is normally used to determine injury levels does not collect data specific to motorcoaches.  
The data collected in NASS/GES is coded as buses, making it very difficult to separate 
the motorcoaches from the other types of buses.   As seen in Table V-3 the injury data 
included motorcoaches, motor homes and transit buses data.  Further, the injury data were 
not classified according to initial point of contact (frontal impact, side impact or 
rollovers) a classification used in the fatal crashes, see Table V-2b. Given the coding and 
the classification of the data, we made a few simplifying assumptions in order to obtain 
injury estimates for motorcoaches.  
  
For injuries, we utilize data from the General Estimate System (GES). Table V-3 shows 
estimates of motorcoach passengers as well as passengers on other buses involved in 
related traffic crashes.  Being police-reported data, the GES data in Table V-3 appear in 
the KABCO scale rather than the body-region based MAIS scale.  Before any meaningful 
analysis can be performed on the injury data, we first convert the KABCO injuries into 
MAIS injuries.

This conversion process employs a commonly used table from an agency report entitled,

 (Table 7.2 from the

injuries sustained by motor vehicle passengers and pedestrians, and reports both the 
KABCO and MAIS injuries of the individuals involved in a crash.  The final KABCO to

Injuries on buses include the following bus types:   motorcoaches, intercity, shuttle buses, 
transit buses, other buses, as well as motor homes. It is very difficult to separate these

docket under NHTSA-1996-1782-21. 
43 
injuries into individual bus types.  As a result, we make some assumptions that will help 
us to breakout the injuries by bus types. We assume that the injuries to occupants on 
motorcoaches followed the same trend as motorcoach fatalities in crashes categorized by 
initial point of impact (Table V-2b). The proportions derived in Table V-1 for fatalities 
will be used to distribute the injuries on motorcoaches similar to the fatalities on 
motorcoaches.  In Table V-1 there were 6.9 fatalities on transit and other buses.  
Therefore the proportion of fatalities that were on transit and other buses is 27.0 
(6.9/25.5) percent (see Table V-1).   
 
In Table V-3, injuries on buses coded bus body type show that there are different types of 
buses included in this category.  Based on anecdotal evidence (In fatalities, motorcoaches 
were 73.0 percent – (18.6/25.5)) we assume that injuries on motorcoaches account for 
approximately 70 percent of total injuries on buses. We fully understand that making 
these assumptions might over estimate the actual number of injuries attributed to 
motorcoaches, but this is the only logical way we could account for motorcoach injuries. 
We solicit comments on these assumptions.  
 
The breakout of injuries that make up the assumed target population (the original target 
population of injuries is multiplied by a factor of 0.70, the assumed number of 
motorcoach fatalities in the population of fatalities) is shown in Table V-5 and total 
7,887.

MAIS 5 10 7 
TOTAL 11,268 7,887 
 
The next step in the operation is to determine the number of injuries that occurred in 
frontal crashes, rollover crashes and side impact crashes. We again assume that injuries 
on motorcoaches follow the same pattern as fatalities on motorcoaches when coded from 
the initial point of impact.  This assumption allows us to distribute the injuries according 
to crash type, looking at crashes from the initial point of contact as opposed to the most 
harmful event.  Otherwise, there would be no injuries assumed for side impacts, simply 
because there were no fatalities in side impacts in Table V-1a.

In Table V- 6a, the rollover incidents were counted as the first event only (e.g., in the row 
labeled “side” these incidents were counted as one rollover and 24 side impacts 
fatalities).  The vehicle was struck in the side and the subsequent event was the rollover. 
This breakout was done in order to account for injuries that occurred in side impact 
crashes.

Table V-6b shows the average number of fatalities and the percentage in each category.  
It is earlier assumed that injuries follow the same pattern as fatalities by initial point of 
impact. Therefore, these percentages are used so as to distribute the injuries in the target 
population into category types. 
 
The target population at each MAIS level is multiplied by the appropriate factor from 
Table V-6b. This breakout is shown in Table V-7. These values are used in a later section 
to calculate the number of injuries that can be prevented if the appropriate 
countermeasures are installed.

VI. BENEFITS 
 
Effectiveness 
This section estimates the potential lives saved and injuries mitigated if a counter-
measure is installed on the subject vehicles.    In order to calculate the benefits, we must 
first establish the effectiveness rate of a lap/shoulder belt and a lap belt. 
 
Table VI-1(a) shows the assumed effectiveness of lap/shoulder belts and Table VI-1(b) 
shows the assumed effectiveness for lap belts in motorcoaches.

• Estimated based on Christina Morgan (June 1999) “Effectiveness of Lap/Shoulder 
Belts in the Back Outboard Seating Positions,” Washington, DC, National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Data from this report were divided into 
crash mode in the report “Lives Saved by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety 
Standards and Other Vehicle Safety Technology, 1960-2002”, October 2004, 
DOT HS 809-833, page 86 for lap belts and Page 100 for lap/shoulder belts.   
 
 
Since lap/shoulder belts and lap belts have not been installed on motorcoaches, we have 
no real world data on their effectiveness.  We use estimates from the rear seat of 
passenger cars by crash mode as a proxy measure of seat belt effectiveness in 
motorcoaches.  We have both lap and lap/shoulder belt fatality effectiveness estimates for 
the rear seat of passenger cars.  The rear seat of a passenger car is somewhat similar to a 
47 
motorcoach seat in that there is a seat back in front of the position and not a dash board 
(which would be the case if front seat occupants were used).    
 
The real debate, in our minds, is frontal impacts.  In sled tests shown earlier in this 
analysis lap belts resulted in more injuries than being unrestrained and lap/shoulder belts 
were obviously more effective.  In addition, we did not measure abdominal injuries, and 
abdominal injuries have been shown to be a problem with lap belts.  Lap/shoulder belts 
do a better job of distributing the load over the chest area of the occupant and are very 
effective for abdominal injuries.  The kinematics and force of an occupant jackknifing 
around the lap belt, potentially causing an abdominal injury, and hitting their head on the 
seat back in front of them, potentially causing head and neck injury, is highly dependent 
upon the speed of the crash.  So, you definitely want a lap/shoulder belt in a severe crash, 
rather than a lap belt.   
 
However, most injuries occur in lower speed crashes.  It would seem that real world data 
from passenger car effectiveness would be a better proxy measure for less severe injuries, 
than test data at high severity.  Lap and lap/shoulder belts are very effective in reducing 
AIS 2-5 injuries in light vehicles and should also be very effective for motorcoaches.  
The issue is how much reliance can be put in the sled test data when making estimates of 
lap belt effectiveness compared to real world data of other vehicle types.  For this 
analysis, we are assuming that real world data on the rear seats in passenger cars are 
closest to the environment in motorcoaches and as such will be a better proxy measure of 
effectiveness for motorcoaches than the sled test data.   
 
Lap/shoulder belt effectiveness and lap belt effectiveness estimates in preventing injury 
was not obtained directly from crash data in the rear seat, but was inferred by examining 
the relationships between other crash data estimates: lap-belt vs. 3-point-belt 
effectiveness in the front seat of cars.  The difference in effectiveness between AIS 2-5 
injuries and fatalities was 5 percentage points, except for frontal impacts with lap belt 
only.  AIS 1 injury effectiveness was found to be 10 percent.     
48 
 
Lives Saved and Injuries Prevented 
 
In order to determine the benefits of adding lap/shoulder belts or lap belts to 
motorcoaches, the number of lives saved and injuries prevented has to be calculated.  To 
estimate the number of lives saved and injuries prevented, first, the potential 
injuries/fatalities (if no one were restrained) needs to be determined.  But since there is no 
known seat belt use on motorcoaches in the crash data, all injuries are injuries if no one 
was belted.  The following formula is used. 
   
Injuries Prevented = Target population injuries * Effectiveness * Usage rate. (Equation 1) 
 
 Where: Fatalities and Injuries are provided in Tables V-1a and V-7   
  Effectiveness values are provided in Table VI-1  
  Belt Usage Rate is assumed to range from 15 percent to 83 percent.   
                        (Taken from the National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS)) 
 
There is no record of seat belt use rate on motorcoaches.  Since there is no data available 
on use rate in buses we examined a range of belt use and derived a breakeven point in 
usage later in the analysis.  At the high end of the range, we assumed that belt use on 
motorcoaches would be no higher than the current use rate in passenger vehicles, which 
was 83 percent for 2008 (taken from the 2008 National Occupant Protection Use Survey 
(NOPUS).   At the low end of the range, we looked at use rates in Australia, that have 
lap/shoulder belts in motorcoaches, and found use rates reported at about or less than 20 
percent.16
  
  Thus, we assume a belt use rate of 15 percent for the low end of the range.  
Again there is no other available statistics.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed later 
on belt use. 
 
Table VI-2 provides an analysis of the fatality benefits associated with the proposed 
requirements based on the FARS data from 1999 through 2008 (taken from Table V-1a).

The injury calculation is divided into AIS 1 injuries and AIS (2-5) injuries.  The AIS 1 
injuries were 10,142.  Of this total, we assume 70% were in motorcoaches, 70% of 
10,142 = 7,099.  We then calculated the assumed proportion in frontal crashes using the 
appropriate factor (see Table V-7) = 7,099 x 0.457 = 3,244. 
Similarly, for side impact crashes the assumed proportion of injuries  
= 7,099 x 0.129= 916. 
For rollover crashes the assumed proportion of injuries  
= 7,099 x 0.274= 1,945. 
 
As an example; 
The number of AIS- I injuries prevented in frontal crashes = 3,244 x 0.10 x0.83 = 269 
The number of AIS- I injuries prevented in side impact crashes = 916 x 0.10 x0.83 = 76 
The number of AIS -I injuries prevented in rollover crashes = 1,945 x.0.10 x0.83 = 161. 
In the above calculations, 0.10 is the effectiveness and 0.83 is the seat belt use rate.

Alternative: Adding a Lap Belt with Belt Use of 11 to 60 Percent 
 
The agency believes that lap belt use on motorcoaches is likely to be less than 
lap/shoulder belt use.  In another analysis18
                                                 
18 “Final Economic Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, Costs and Benefits of Putting a 
Shoulder Belt in the Center Seats of Passenger Cars and Light Trucks”, June 2004, Docket No. NHTSA-
2004-18726-2.    
 we assumed lap belt use would be 10 
percentage points less than lap/shoulder belt use.  This was based on data found in the 
Christina Morgan (June 1999) “Effectiveness of Lap/Shoulder Belts in the Back 
Outboard Seating Positions,” Washington, DC, National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration.  The best data we have from the Morgan report is outboard rear seat 
passenger car lap and lap/shoulder belt usage numbers from FARS from 1988 to 1997.  In 
1989 all outboard seats were required to have lap/shoulder belts. So if we look at usage 
currently all the vehicles with outboard lap belts would be at least 21 years old and we 
wouldn’t get much data to analyze.  The data (Table 1-5, page 10 of the Morgan report) 
show lap belt use of 33% and lap/shoulder belt use of 46% for those seats that were 
54 
equipped with those belts respectively.  Using  the ratio (33/46 = 71.7%) of the  
percentage use of lap belts to lap/shoulder belts results in the range of lap belt use of 10.8 
to 59.5 percent (we’ll round these to 11 percent and 60 percent) compared to 15 to 83 
percent use for lap/shoulder belts. (15% * .717 = 10.8% and 83% * .717 = 59.5%)

VII. Costs 
  
Cost of Installing Lap/Shoulder Belts on New Motorcoach Passenger Seating 
Positions 
The size of motorcoach fleet estimate from the Motorcoach Census 2008 is 29,325 
vehicles.  Motorcoach Facts 2008 states that approximately 2000 motorcoaches are 
produced annually.19
 
 The following cost estimates have been obtained from IMMI who 
has been working with Greyhound Bus Company to install three-point belts on their 
motorcoaches.  The incremental cost of adding IMMI seats with three-point belts on a 54 
passenger motorcoach is approximately $9,900.  The cost to change the seat anchorages 
and to reinforce the floor is approximately $3,000.  Total cost of adding belts, changing 
the anchorages and reinforcing the floor is approximately $12,900. The total cost of 
adding three point seat belts to all new motorcoaches is $25.8 million ($12,900 x 2,000). 
As seen later, adding a shoulder belt to the driver seat for 60 percent of the motorcoaches 
will added an additional $34.000 to the fleet. Total cost of the adding three point belts 
and shoulder belt to 60 percent of the driver’s seat is approximately $25.8 million ($25.8 
million + $34,000).  
Cost of Lap Belts on New Motorcoaches  
For the alternative of adding a lap belt, the agency estimates that the cost per new bus is 
approximately $6,000.  The total cost per fleet is $12,000,000 ($6,000 x 2,000). 
 
Cost of Installing Lap/Shoulder belts on Bus Driver Seating Positions 
FMVSS No. 208 currently requires buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 
4,536 kg (10,000 pounds) or less to provide a lap/shoulder belt for the driver seating 
position.  For heavier (large) buses, FMVSS No. 208 requires that all buses be equipped, 
at a minimum, with either lap or lap/shoulder belts at the driver’s designated seating 
position.20  The difference in costs between a lap belt only and a lap/shoulder belt at the 
driver seating position is approximately $28.1121
 
.  This cost includes the difference in 
cost between a lap and lap/shoulder belt, adding in pretensioners and load limiters for the 
lap/shoulder belt and bringing these estimates up to 2008 dollars.  Some manufacturers 
have suggested that only about 40 percent of the new motorcoach buyers are requesting 
lap/shoulder belts.  That would add approximately $34,000 (2000 x.6 x $28.11) to the 
cost of the fleet.  Therefore, the cost of requiring lap/shoulder belts in the driver seat of 
motorcoaches and other buses is estimated to be $34,000.

Modes” M.J Bradley and Associates  
20 Manufacturers may alternatively equip buses with a complete occupant protection system that requires no 
action by the vehicle occupants.  However, currently all large bus manufacturers have opted to install seat 
belts at the driver’s position.

Passenger Cars and Light Trucks”, December 2004, DOT HS 809 834, Pages 81 and 88.   
59 
Cost of Installing Lap or Lap/Shoulder Belts on Existing Motorcoach Passenger 
Seating Positions (Retrofitting) 
 
NHTSA has the authority to promulgate safety standards for existing commercial motor 
vehicles under Sec. 101(f) of Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 (Public 
Law 106-159; Dec. 9, 1999).  According to the Nathan report, Motorcoach Census 2005, 
approximately 2,665 of the motorcoach service providers operated 10 or fewer buses.  
Rulemaking believes that many of these motorcoach operators may be considered small 
businesses.  Therefore, the effects on small business in promulgating a regulation to 
install lap/shoulder belts on existing motorcoaches may be substantial and should be 
considered. 
 
Greyhound estimated in the January 15, 2009 meeting with the agency that the cost to 
retrofit existing newer MCI model motorcoaches with lap/shoulder seat belts in each 
passenger seating position to be approximately $40,000.  The reason for the substantial 
cost increase over the cost associated with installing laps/shoulder belts in new 
motorcoaches is due to the fact that all of the existing seats would need to be replaced.  
Additional seat anchorage strengthening to accommodate the additional loading from the 
seat belts would need to be done. This may include strengthening both the floor and side 
wall and may be even more costly on older motorcoaches.  The existing fleet size is 
approximately 29,325 motorcoaches and assuming that all motorcoaches would require 
similar structural changes, the total cost for retrofitting the entire fleet with lap/shoulder 
seat belts to be $1,173,000,000 ($40,000 x 29,325). This may be an under estimate 
considering older motorcoaches.  The cost of retrofitting a motorcoach with lap belt only 
is estimated to be approximately $6,000 per motorcoach.  The cost of retrofitting the fleet 
of motorcoaches with lap belts is $175,950,000 ($6,000 x 29,325).  This cost assumes 
that the motorcoaches are lap belt ready.  If the motorcoaches are not lap belt ready, then 
the motorcoaches must be reinforced in order to support lap belts.  The agency assumes 
that the reinforcement of the motorcoach to accommodate a lap belt is similar to the 
reinforcement of the motorcoach for a lap/shoulder belt.  As a result, the cost of 
retrofitting motorcoaches to accommodate lap belts is $997,050,000 ($34,000 x 29,325).  
 
Given the very large expense to retrofit, it is not likely to be economically viable for 
small operators.  The agency has heard claims of the possibility that some small operator 
might be forced to retrofit because consumers might decide to use only buses that have 
seat belts.  Given that many of the small operators are regional and specialty carriers that 
do not compete with large established companies, the agency does not believe that 
lacking a seat belt in the motorcoach would have an adverse effect on the economic 
viability of small operators.  
 
Weight Impacts 
Based on preliminary results from a NHTSA contractor doing cost/weight teardown 
studies of motorcoach seats, it is estimated that the weight added by 3-point lap/shoulder 
belts ranges from 5.96 to 9.95 pounds per 2-person seat.  This is the weight only of the 
seat belt assembly itself and does not include changing the design of the seat, reinforcing 
the floor, walls or other areas of the motorcoach.  Assuming a 54 passenger motorcoach, 
60 
the added weight for the 3-point lap/shoulder belt assembly alone is 161 to 269 pounds 
(27 * 5.96 – 9.95).   
 
The weight of a motorcoach varies.  The three that NHTSA have tested have the 
following weights.

2000 MCI 102-EL3

18,053 22,634 
 
Since one kilogram equals 2.2046 pounds, the curb weights range from 28,000 to 39,800 
pounds and the fully loaded vehicle weights at GVWR range from 37,800 to 50,000 
pounds.  A standard formula for estimating the impact on fuel economy from weight is: 
 (Base vehicle weight/[vehicle weight + added weight])^0.8 * Baseline fuel economy. 
 
This formula was based on light vehicle vehicles and the agency is not sure that it applies 
for a heavy vehicle like a motorcoach.  However, assuming that it does apply, we can 
estimate the impact that a weight increase would have on motorcoach fuel economy.  
First, we assume that the average in use weight of a motorcoach is 45,000 lbs.  Second, 
the average baseline mpg of a motorcoach is estimated to be 5.7 mpg. 22
 
  Third, the 
projected price of gasoline was taken from the Annual Energy Outlook (in 2008 dollars) 
starting in MY 2015, assuming that would be the effective date of a final rule.  The 
agency estimates the present value of changes in fuel costs at a 3 and 7 percent discount 
rate.  Table VII-2 presents an example calculation for a 161 pound increase in weight at a 
3 percent discount rate.  The increase is shown in the last row of the last two columns.  
The average motorcoach drives 56,000 miles per year.  Adding 161 pounds changes the 
average fuel economy of that motorcoach from 5.7 mpg to 5.6837 mpg.  Over an average 
year, the motorcoach would use 9,825 gallons at 5.7 mpg and would use 9,853 gallons at 
5.6837 mpg, so adding 161 pounds results in 28 more gallons of gasoline used in an 
average year.  Because of discounting back to present value, we estimate the impact on a 
year to year basis as shown in the next table.

VIII. Cost Effectiveness and Benefits Cost Analyses 
 
A.  Cost Effectiveness Analysis 
 
This chapter provides cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost analysis for the motorcoach 
rule. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB Circular A-4) requires all agencies to 
perform both analyses in support of rules, effective January 1, 2004. 
 
The cost-effectiveness measures the cost per equivalent life saved (i.e., per equivalent 
fatality), while the benefit-cost measures the net benefit which is the difference between 
benefits and net costs in monetary values.  Injury benefits are expressed in fatal 
equivalents in the cost-effectiveness analysis and are further translated into monetary 
value in the benefit-cost analysis.  Fatal equivalents represent the savings throughout the 
vehicle life and are discounted to reflect their present values.   
 
To calculate a cost per equivalent fatality, nonfatal injuries must be expressed in terms of 
fatalities.  This is done by comparing the values of preventing nonfatal injuries to the 
value of preventing a fatality.  Comprehensive values, which include both economic 
impacts and loss of quality (or value) of life considerations, will be used to determine the 
relative value of nonfatal injuries to fatalities.  Value-of-life measurements inherently 
include a value for lost quality of life plus a valuation of lost material consumption that is 
represented by measuring consumers’ after-tax lost productivity.  In addition to these 
factors, preventing a motor vehicle fatality will reduce costs for medical care, emergency 
services, insurance administrative costs, workplace costs, and legal costs.  The sum of 
both value-of-life and economic cost impacts is referred to as the comprehensive cost 
savings from reducing fatalities.  
 
These values were taken from the most recent study of vehicle crash-related economic 
impacts published by NHTSA.23
Table VIII-1 
  The reported costs were in 2000 dollars, but since the 
relative values between injuries and fatalities are all we need for this analysis, they have 
not been adjusted to 2006.  Table VIII-1 shows the comprehensive costs for each MAIS 
injury level.

Source: A calculation based on data presented in ‘The Economic Impact of Motor vehicle Crashes 2000” 
updated to reflect guidance found in February 5th 2000, DOT Memorandum “Treatment of the Economic 
Value of a Statistical Life in Departmental Analyses.” 
 
Fatal equivalents are derived by applying the relative fatality ratios to the estimated 
MAIS 1-5 injury benefits.  As discussed earlier, benefits are realized through a vehicle’s 
life.  Thus, fatal equivalents are required to be discounted at 3 and 7 percent.  Table VIII-
2 shows the discounted rate for motorcoaches at the 3 and 7 percent levels.    
 
There is general agreement within the economic community that the appropriate basis for 
determining discount rates is the marginal opportunity costs of lost or displaced funds.  
When these funds involve capital investment, the marginal, real rate of return on capital 
must be considered.  However, when these funds represent lost consumption, the 
appropriate measure is the rate at which society is willing to trade-off future for current 
consumption.  This is referred to as the "social rate of time preference," and it is generally 
assumed that the consumption rate of interest, i.e., the real, after-tax rate of return on 
widely available savings instruments or investment opportunities, is the appropriate 
measure of its value.  
 
Estimates of the social rate of time preference have been made by a number of authors.  
Robert Lind24 estimated that the social rate of time preference is between zero and six 
percent, reflecting the rates of return on Treasury bills and stock market portfolios.  Kolb 
and Sheraga25 put the rate at between one and five percent, based on returns to stocks and 
three-month Treasury bills.  Moore and Viscusi26
 
 calculated a two percent real time rate 
of time preference for health, which they characterize as being consistent with financial 
market rates for the period covered by their study.  Moore and Viscusi's estimate was 
derived by estimating the implicit discount rate for deferred health benefits exhibited by 
workers in their choice of job risk.  OMB Circular A-4 recommends agencies use both 3 
percent and 7 percent as the “social rate of time preference.”   
Safety benefits can occur at any time during the vehicle's lifetime.   For this analysis, the 
agency assumes that the distribution of weighted yearly vehicle miles traveled is an 
appropriate proxy measure for the distribution of such crashes over the vehicle's lifetime.  
This measure takes into account both vehicle survival rates and changes over time in 
annual average vehicle miles traveled (VMT).   Multiplying the percent of a vehicle's 
total lifetime mileage that occurs in each year by the discount factor and summing these 
percentages over the years of the vehicle's operating life, results in a factor of 0.7858 for

motorcoaches under a 3 percent discounted rate.  For the 7 percent discounted rate, these 
factors are 0.5999 for motorcoaches. 
 
In order to develop the discount factors in Table VIII-2, the following steps were taken, 
using the following factors.  From the “Motorcoach Census 2008”, page 9, an average 
mileage per motorcoach was obtained. The Census determined the average mileage by 
summing the number of motorcoaches and the total route mileage for those coaches (1.88 
billion), to determine that the average motorcoach drives 56,000 miles per year.  There 
are average sales of approximately 2,000 coaches per year, and a fleet of 33,536. Since 
many instances the motorcoach engine is replaced after approximately 20 years, some 
longer, we calculated the average life of a motorcoach was 23 years27
 
.  The 23 years 
number was derived by using the survivability (Column two Table VIII-2) of heavy 
trucks as a proxy for motorcoaches. Heavy trucks survivability was used because there is 
none available for motorcoaches.  We assumed that the average mileage per motorcoach 
would decrease by a small percentage (2%) per year by age of the bus.  This assumption 
tries to take into account that as motorcoaches get older, they are more likely to have 
mechanical problems that would keep them from full duties.  Similar decreases in annual 
miles driven by age also occur for passenger cars and light trucks.  It also takes into 
account human nature, that is when given a chance to drive a new or older bus to an 
event, most people would choose the newer bus.  In the earlier years the coach is driven 
more miles and in the later years the coach is driven less miles.  Thus, we determined that 
an average of 56,000 miles occur in Year 8 of the life of the motorcoach given the 
survivability of the vehicle and the total mileage of the fleet.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
                                                 
27 While the bus itself lasts longer and will be sold for other purposes, the decision makers would consider 
its’ life over the 15 years.  Theoretically there would be a small benefit to society in reducing injuries after 
the 15 years, but they would add little to the analysis due to the heavy discounting in later years.

Multiplying the percent of a vehicle's total lifetime mileage that occurs in each year by 
the discount factor and summing these percentages over the 23 (motorcoaches) years of 
the vehicle's operating life, results in the following multipliers for the average of 
motorcoaches as shown in Table VIII-3.

The discount multipliers in Table VIII-3 are multiplied by the equivalent life saved (ELS) 
to determine their present value. The discounted ELS are shown in Table VIII-4.   
An example of the calculation of equivalent lives saved discounted is:  
For motorcoaches at three percent = 30.07 x 0.7858 = 23.63.

Costs 
Total incremental costs for lap/shoulder belts equals the new vehicle cost (2,000 vehicles 
* $12,900 = $25.8 million) plus the incremental cost for drivers of $34,000, plus the 
increased costs in fuel usage.  Total incremental costs for lap belts equals the new vehicle 
cost (2,000 vehicles* $6,000 =$12.0 million) plus the increased cost in fuel usage.  The 
increased fuel costs depend on added weight and the discount rate used.   These are 
derived by taking the vehicle lifetime fuel costs in Table VII-3 and multiplying by 2,000 
vehicles (e.g. $1,085 for 161 lbs. at a 3% discount rate * 2,000 = $2.17 million). Tables 
VIII-5(a) and VIII- 5(b) show the total costs per vehicle and total incremental vehicle 
fleet costs.

To calculate the cost per ELS, the total costs are divided by the discounted ELS.   
Examples:  
Lap/shoulder belts on motorcoaches at 83 percent belt use rate adding 161 pounds at 3 
percent: $28.00 million/20.92 = $1.34 million. Adding 161 lbs. at 7%: $27.43 million 
/15.97 = $1.72 million. 
Lap/shoulder belts on motorcoaches at 83 percent belt use rate adding 269 pounds at 7 
percent: $28.50 million/15.97= $1.78 million. Adding 269 lbs. at 3%: $29.45 million / 
20.92 = $1.41 million. 
 Similarly: Lap/shoulder belts on motorcoaches at 15 percent belt use rate adding 161 
pounds at 3 percent: $28.00 million/3.77 = $7.43 million. Adding 161 lbs. at 7%: = 
$27.43 million /2.88 = $9.52 million 
Lap/shoulder belts on motorcoaches at 15 percent belt use rate adding 269 pounds at 7 
percent: $28.50 million/2.88 = $9.9 million. Adding 269 lbs. at 3%: $29.45 million / 3.77 
= $7.81 million 
 
69 
Lap  belts on motorcoaches at 60 percent belt use rate adding 108 pounds at 3 percent: 
$13.45 million/10.56 = $1.27 million; Adding 180 lbs at 3 percent  $14.43 million/10.56 
= $1.37  million  
 
Lap  belts on motorcoaches at 60 percent belt use rate adding 108 lbs. at 7%: $13.07/8.06 
= $1.62 million. Adding 180 pounds at 7 percent: $13.79 million/8.06 = $1.71 million;  
 
Similarly: Lap belts on motorcoaches at 11 percent belt use rate adding 108 pounds at 3 
percent: $13.45 million/1.93 = $6.97 million. Adding 180 lbs at 3 percent: $14.43/1.93 = 
$7.48 million  
 
Lap belts on motorcoaches at 11 percent belt use rate adding 108 lbs. at 7 percent  $13.07 
million/1.48= $8.83.  Adding 180 pounds at 7 percent: $13.79 million/1.48 = $9.32 
million.  
 
 
Table VIII-6 summarizes the results of the cost per equivalent life saved estimates.  
Given the assumptions in this analysis, and comparing the high end (or the low end) of 
the use range of lap/shoulder belts to the high end (or the low end) of the use range of lap 
belts, the results indicate that lap/shoulder belts and lap belts have essentially the same 
cost per equivalent life saved.  However, lap/shoulder belts provide more benefits and we 
are more confident of the benefits and more sure that there are no disbenefits from 
lap/shoulder belts compared to lap belts.

Retrofit of Existing Motorcoaches 
The agency is not proposing any requirements to retrofit existing buses with either lap or 
lap/shoulder belts for the driver or passenger positions of motorcoaches.  The service life 
of a motorcoach can be as long as 23 years or longer.  Because of this, we believe that 
significant strengthening of the motorcoach structure would need to be conducted in 
order to accommodate the additional loading from the seat belts, that each used 
motorcoach would need to be assessed structurally on a one-by-one basis, and that in 
many cases the existing seats would need to be replaced.   
70 
 
Moreover, there could be significant safety issues when retrofitting a motorcoach.  As 
seen in the motorcoach rollover testing, the motorcoach structure might not be able to 
support the load of belted occupants during a rollover crash if only belts were added to 
the seats or new seats with belts were installed.    Because the entire motorcoach structure 
may need to be designed to accommodate the additional loading, the agency does not 
really know the cost or weight implications, and even whether retrofitting is a viable 
option for all older motorcoaches.  One estimate we have is that it could cost up to 
$40,000 to retrofit an older motorcoach.  Comments are requested that would provide 
information on the cost and weight implications of retrofitting a variety of motorcoaches, 
including impacts on fuel usage costs.  The costs of such an overhaul may make a retrofit 
requirement economically infeasible for small motorcoach operators. The total cost of 
retrofitting lap/shoulder belts to the fleet (without including increased remaining lifetime 
fuel costs) is $1,173,000,000 ($40,000 x 29,325).  Cost per equivalent life saved = 
1,173,000,000/26.62 = $44,064,613.  The cost per equivalent life saved at the 3 percent 
level is $56.1(1,173,000,000/20.92) million and at the 7 percent level it is 
$73.5(1,173,000,000/15.97) million.  These benefit estimates are at the high end of the 
range – at 83 percent usage.  These costs do not include increased remaining lifetime fuel 
costs incurred by adding weight to the motorcoach.  Weight would vary depending upon 
the needed structural changes and lifetime fuel cost would vary depending upon the age 
of motorcoaches that would be retrofitted.   Retrofitting the entire fleet of motorcoaches 
with a lap/shoulder belt is not cost beneficial based on our current set of assumptions. 
 
The cost per equivalent life saved was also determined for the countermeasure of 
retrofitting a lap belt to the seats on motorcoaches.  For this analysis we assume that a lap 
belt could be added at a cost of $6,000 to $34,000 per motorcoach.  At the high end of 
safety belt use – 60 percent usage, there were 13.44 equivalent lives saved.  After 
discounting there are an estimated 10.56 lives saved at a 3 percent discount rate and 8.06 
lives saved at a 7 percent discount rate.  The total cost of equipping the fleet with lap 
belts (without including increases in remaining lifetime fuel costs) ranges from 
$175,950,000 to $997,050,000. The cost per equivalent life saved at the 3 percent level 
ranges from $16.7($175,950,000/10.56) to $94.4 ($997,050,000/10.56) million and at the 
7 percent level it ranges from $21.8($175,950,000/8.06) to $123.8($997,050,000/8.06) 
million.  Under the current set of assumptions, even with this high estimate of belt use, 
and remember that these costs would go up a small extent with increased fuel costs, 
retrofitting motorcoaches with a lap belt is not cost beneficial.

IX. Benefit-Cost Analysis 
 
Fatality and Injury Prevented Benefits:    
 
In order to provide a true benefit cost analysis, benefits (equivalent lives saved) must be 
monetized.  Recently, the Department of Transportation has determined that the best 
current estimate of the economic value of preventing a human fatality is $5.8 million (in 
2007 dollars).  However, new relative value coefficients for preventing injuries of 
different severity have not been developed.  NHTSA is conducting research to revise the 
previously developed estimates.  The revised estimates will be published when they 
become available.  In the interim, we have adjusted the current estimates to reflect the 
revised $5.8 million28
 
 statistical life for both crash avoidance and crashworthiness 
Federal motor vehicle safety standards resulting in new comprehensive costs of $6.1 
million (2007 dollars) per fatality.  Table IX-1 shows the comprehensive values used for 
each injury severity level, as well as the relative incident-based weights for nonfatal 
injuries, MAIS 1-5.  For this analysis, the estimates were inflated to 2008 dollars, 
resulting in $6.2 million per statistical life.

QALYs: Quality-Adjusted Life-Years 
 
Note that the $6.1 million value of a statistical life contains elements found in three of the 
factors in the above table (QALY’s, household productivity, and the after-tax portion of 
market productivity).  The value of statistical life is thus represented within these three 
factors and is not shown separately.   For this analysis, we will use the comprehensive 
relative costs for crashworthiness, the relative costs are similar to a crashworthiness 
countermeasure.   
 
The cost-effectiveness estimate measures the cost per equivalent life saved (i.e., per 
equivalent fatality), while the benefit-cost estimate measures the net benefit which is the 
difference between benefits and net costs in monetary values.  Injury benefits are 
expressed in fatal equivalents in cost-effectiveness analysis and are further translated into 
monetary value in benefit-cost analysis.  Fatal equivalents represent the savings 
throughout the vehicle life and are discounted to reflect their present values.   
73 
When accounting for the benefits of safety measures, cost savings not included in value 
of life measurements must also be accounted for.  Value of life measurements inherently 
include a value for lost quality of life plus a valuation of lost material consumption that is 
represented by measuring consumer’s after-tax lost productivity.  In addition to these 
factors, preventing a motor vehicle fatality will reduce costs for medical care, emergency 
services, insurance administrative costs, workplace costs, and legal costs.  If the 
countermeasure is one that also prevents a crash from occurring, property damage and 
travel delay would be prevented as well.  The sum of both value of life and economic cost 
impacts is referred to as the comprehensive cost savings from reducing fatalities.  
 
The countermeasures that result from FMVSS No. 208 and 210, affect vehicle 
crashworthiness and would thus not involve property damage or travel delay.  Therefore, 
the comprehensive cost savings from preventing a fatality for crashworthiness 
countermeasures is $6.23 in 2008 economics.  The basis for the benefit-cost analyses will 
thus be $6.2 million.   
 
For example, if 83 percent lap/shoulder belt use is assumed, multiplying the value of life 
by the equivalent lives saved derives the total benefits from injuries and fatalities 
reduced.  Subtracting total net costs from the total benefits derives the net benefits. For 
example, for motorcoaches total benefits discounted at a three percent discount rate, 
(20.92 x $6.2 million) - $28.0 to 29.4 million = $101.7 – 100.3 million, at the seven 
percent discount rate (15.97 x $6.2 million) - $27.4 to $28.5 million = $71.6 to $70.5 
million.   
 
The results for each scenario are summarized in Table IX-2.  Positive Net Benefits 
indicate that Benefits valued at $6.2 million per equivalent life are higher than Net Costs.  
Negative Net Benefits indicate that Benefits valued at $6.2 million per equivalent life are 
lower than Net Costs.

Sensitivity Analysis 
For lap/shoulder belts: 
Using the equation: Injuries x Effectiveness x Belt Use = Injuries Prevented  
Breakeven belt use rate is derived by the following method:  
Given: (IE) x .83(belt use) =26.62; where (IE is injuries x effectiveness),  
Then, IE= 26.62/.83 = 32.07  
Discount rate: 0.7858 at 3% and by 0.5999 at 7% 
32.07x (Breakeven point) = Y.  Where Y (at 3% discount rate) = $28.0 to 29.4M /(0.7858 
x $6.2M) = $5.74 to 6.04 M and Y (at 7% discount rate) = $27.4 to 28.5M/(0.5999 x 
$6.2M) =$7.37 to 7.66 M 
Then Breakeven point= $5.74 to 6.04/32.07 = 17.9 to 18.8% at 3% discount 
Also Breakeven point = $7.37 to 7.66/32.07 = 23.0 to 23.9% at 7% discount. 
Breakeven belt use rate =18.8% at a 3% discount rate and 23.9% at 7% discount rate.  
Therefore a belt use rate of 24 percent or higher in motorcoaches would be cost effective. 
 
Similarly for lap belts only: 
IE= 13.44/.60 = 22.4 
Discount rate: 0.7858 at 3% and by 0.5999 at 7% 
75 
22.4 x (Breakeven point) = Y.  Where Y (at 3% discount rate) = $13.45 to $14.43M / 
(0.7858 x $6.2M) = $2.76 to $2.96 M and Y (at 7% discount rate) = $13.07 to 
$13.79M/(0.5999 x $6.2M) =$3.51 to $3.71 M 
Then Breakeven point= $2.76/22.4 to $2.96/22.4 = 12.3% to 13.2% at 3% discount 
Also Breakeven point = $3.51/22.4 to $3.71/22.4 = 15.7% to 16.6% at 7% discount. 
Breakeven belt use rate =13.2% at a 3% discount rate and 16.6% at 7% discount rate.  
Therefore a belt use rate of 17 percent or higher in motorcoaches would be cost effective. 
 
 
With an estimated breakeven point of 24 percent for lap/shoulder belts and 17 percent for 
lap belts, the difference in use between the two types of belts systems becomes very 
important.  The agency has found in the rear seat of passenger cars that lap belt use was 
71.7 percent of lap/shoulder belt use, as used previously in this analysis.  Since 71.7 
percent of 24 percent equals 17.2 percent, the cost per equivalent life saved between lap 
belts and lap/shoulder belts is essentially the same.  This is the same conclusion as 
derived from the results in Table VIII-6.

X.  ALTERNATIVES 
 
The agency has examined an alternative of adding a lap belt only as a substitute for 
lap/shoulder belts on motorcoaches.  Real world data on light vehicles and sled testing 
with motorcoach seats both show that lap/shoulder belts are more effective than lap belts 
in reducing injuries and fatalities.  Given the cost estimates and effectiveness estimates 
assumed in this analysis, the cost per equivalent life saved is essentially the same 
between lap belts and lap/shoulder belts.  The breakeven point for lap belt use is 17 
percent and for lap/shoulder belt use is 24 percent.  However, lap/shoulder belts are used 
more often than lap belts.  The ratio of this difference is essentially the same as was 
found between lap and lap/shoulder belt usage in the rear seat of passenger cars.  
Assuming that this relationship would hold for motorcoaches, results in essentially the 
same cost per equivalent life saved for lap belts as for lap/shoulder belts. 
 
The agency also looked at the seat belt and seat anchorage strength requirements of the 
European Union standard, ECE R.14, and the Australian standard, ADR 68.  ECE R.14 
requires seat and seat anchorages to withstand a total lap/shoulder belt load of 9,000 N 
along with a 10 g inertial seat loading for small buses (M2 category 29) and 6.6 g inertial 
seat loading for large buses (M3 category30
 
).  We estimated that for a 40 kg seat, the total 
load on the anchorages in an ECE R.14 test is 10,300 N per seating position.  In contrast, 
the total anchorage loads applied in FMVSS No. 210 is about 26,700 N per seating 
position.  The ADR 68 seat and seat belt anchorage test specifies simultaneous 
application of loading from the belted occupant, the unbelted occupant in the rear and a 
20 g inertial seat loading. We estimated that the ADR 68 anchorage test would result in 
significantly greater anchorage loads than those in the FMVSS No. 210 test.  The loads 
we measured in the simulated 30 mph barrier impact exceeded the loads applied per the 
EU standards, and the measured loads were close to the FMVSS No. 210 loads so the 
agency adopted the FMVSS No. 210 requirements.  One of the reasons we are proposing 
higher strength than the EU standard is that we are proposing that the seat anchorages be 
able to withstand the loads in a 30 mph full frontal rigid barrier crash when the seat is 
occupied by a belted occupant and when the seat behind is occupied by an unbelted 
occupant. So the seat anchorages have to withstand loads from the seat belt, the inertial 
seat loads, and the loading from the occupant behind.   
The agency tested two seats that are designed to meet the ECE R.14 requirements for M2 
(10 g seats) and M3 buses (6.6 g seats) and both of those seats performed well in the 
motorcoach 30 mph frontal crash test and sled tests.  Theoretically, an alternative analysis 
would compare the marginal costs and benefits of seats that are designed to just comply 
with the EU standard to a seat that just complies with our proposal.  However, we do not 
have a seat that is minimally compliant and it is difficult for us to determine how much 
more safety benefits a seat minimally compliant to FMVSS No. 210 would have over a 
seat minimally compliant to ECE R.14.  Similarly, how much more costly is such a seat 
                                                 
29 M2 category buses have more than eight seating positions and a mass not exceeding 11,023 lbs. 
30 M3 category buses have more than eight seating positions and a mass exceeding 11,023 lbs. 
77 
over the minimally compliant ECE R.14 seat.  Data or estimates on both costs and 
benefits would be needed for a proper marginal cost/benefit analysis.     
 
XI. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT AND UNFUNDED 
MANDATES REFORM ACT ANALYSIS 
 
Regulatory Flexibility Act   
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. §601 et seq.) requires agencies to 
evaluate the potential effects of their proposed and final rules on small businesses, small 
organizations and small governmental jurisdictions.  In compliance with the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 60l et seq., NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this proposed 
rule on small entities.  The head of the agency has certified that this proposed rule will 
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.    The 
factual basis for the certification (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) is set forth below.  Although the 
agency is not required to issue an initial regulatory flexibility analysis, we discuss below 
many of the issues that an initial regulatory flexibility analysis would address.    
   
Overview of the objectives of and legal basis for the proposed rule   
This rule is needed to improve the safety of occupants in motorcoaches.  The NPRM 
proposes to require lap/shoulder belts on a number of motorcoaches.  Presently a very 
small percent of the motorcoaches have a lap/shoulder belt.                         
 
Description and estimate of the number of small entities to which the rule, if made 
final, will apply; compliance impacts  
This rule affects motor vehicle manufacturers, motorcoach manufacturers and 
motorcoach seat manufacturers. 
 
Business entities are defined as small businesses using the North American Industry 
Classification system (NAICS) code, for the purpose of receiving Small Business 
Administration assistance.  One of the criteria for determining size, as stated in 13 CFR 
121.201, is the number of employees in the firm.  For establishments primarily engaged 
in manufacturing or assembling automobiles, light and heavy duty trucks, buses, motor 
homes, new tires, or motor vehicle body manufacturing (NAICS code 336211), the firm 
must have less than 1,000 employees to be classified as a small business.  For supplier 
establishments manufacturing many of the safety systems, the firm must have less than 
750 employees to be classified as a small business.  For establishments manufacturing 
motor vehicle seats and interior trim packages (NAICS code 336360), alterers and 
second-stage manufacturers, the firm must have less than 500 employees to be classified 
as a small business.   
 
This NPRM directly affects motorcoaches and motorcoach seat manufacturers.  There are 
five motorcoach manufacturers and at least two motorcoach seat manufacturers.  The five 
manufacturers are large businesses (more than 1,000 employees for manufacturers).  The 
two motorcoach seat manufacturers are considered large businesses (more than 500 
employees for suppliers).

This proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities that are manufacturers.  None of the U.S. motorcoach manufacturers and 
motorcoach seat manufacturers is a small business.   
 
Some of the purchasers of new motorcoaches are small motorcoach operators.  However, 
purchasers of motorcoaches are indirectly affected by this proposal and only those 
entities directly affected by proposals are required to be addressed in a regulatory 
flexibility discussion or analysis.   
 
The NPRM also discusses, but does not propose, retrofitting existing motorcoaches.  If 
retrofitting became part of the final rule, it would affect motorcoach operators directly.  
Based on the Motorcoach Census31
 
, there were 3,137 motorcoach carriers in the United 
States in 2007.  An estimated 78.8 percent (or about 2,470 carriers) have less than 10 
motorcoaches in their fleet and average 3 motorcoaches and 11 employees.  The small 
business definition for all transit and ground passenger transportation (subsector 485) and 
in particular the Charter Bus Industry (NAICS code 485510) is revenue of $7 million.   
Even though we do not have revenue information for these firms, it is very likely that the 
majority of these 2,470 carriers are small businesses.  
If the agency decides later to propose retrofitting of existing motorcoaches, it would be 
through a supplemental NPRM.  If we issue such an SNPRM, we will assess the impact

of the proposed rule on small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and prepare and publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis if 
appropriate. 
 
A description of the projected reporting, recording keeping and other compliance 
requirements of a final rule including an estimate of the classes of small entities 
which will be subject to the requirement and the type of professional skills necessary 
for preparation of the report or record.      
There are no reporting requirements associated with this proposal.     
 
An identification, to the extent practicable, of all relevant Federal rules which may 
duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the final rule.     
We know of no Federal rules which duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the proposal.   
 
A description of any significant alternatives to the final rule which accomplish the 
stated objectives of applicable statutes and which minimize any significant economic 
impact of the final rule on small entities.   
The agency has considered the alternative of requiring lap belts for passengers instead of 
lap/shoulder belts.  Lap belts, while effective against ejection, would provide only a 
portion of the benefits of passenger frontal crash protection as lap/shoulder belts.  For 
that reason, the agency prefers the alternative of a lap/shoulder belt requirement.   
 
The costs and benefits of each alternative is discussed in this document.  Because the 
preferred alternative of lap/shoulder belts would not have a significant economic impact 
on small entities, there is no alternative that would minimize a significant economic 
impact on small entities. 
  
  
Retrofit  
With regard to a retrofit requirement applying to a population of on-road vehicles, 
NHTSA is seeking information on the potential effects of a retrofit requirement on small 
businesses, small organizations, and small Government jurisdictions.  This PRIA and the 
NPRM have questions that would assist the agency in analyzing the potential impacts of a 
retrofit requirement on small businesses.  An estimated 78.8 percent of the 3,137 
motorcoach carriers in the United States in 2007 (or about 2,470 carriers) have less than 
10 motorcoaches in their fleet, and an average of three motorcoaches and eleven 
employees.  The documents request comments on the merits of applying a retrofit 
requirement to a limited population of on-road vehicles to minimize any significant 
economic impact on small entities, such as applying a retrofit requirement to only those 
motorcoaches manufactured after 2010, and/or only to motorcoaches that have seat belt 
ready passenger seats, etc., and providing extra lead time for the vehicles to be retrofitted.  
Responses to those questions will assist the agency in deciding whether to proceed with a 
proposal to require on-road motorcoaches to be retrofitted with seat belts. Comments are 
requested on the number of small businesses among motorcoach operators (compared to 
the Small Business Definition of $7 million of revenue per year) and the age of 
motorcoaches owned by small and large businesses.

UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM ACT.   
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) requires agencies to 
prepare a written assessment of the costs, benefits, and other effects of proposed or final 
rules that include a Federal mandate likely to result in the expenditures by States, local or 
tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million 
annually (adjusted annually for inflation with base year of 1995).  Adjusting this amount 
by the implicit gross domestic product price deflator for the 2008 results in $133 million 
(122.42/92.106 = 1.33).  The assessment may be included in conjunction with other 
assessments, as it is here.  The final rule is not likely to result in expenditures by State, 
local or tribal governments of more than $133 million annually.  The costs of this 
proposed rule are estimated to be less than $30 million.
