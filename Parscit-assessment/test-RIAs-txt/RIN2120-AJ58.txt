Executive Summary 
This report documents a benefit/cost analysis of FAA’s proposed amendments to 
its flight, duty and rest regulations applicable to certificate holders and their flight crew 
members. The proposal recognizes the growing similarities between the types of 
operations and the universality of factors that lead to fatigue in most individuals.  Fatigue 
threatens aviation safety because it increases the risk of pilot error that can lead to an 
accident.  The proposed requirements would eliminate the current distinctions between 
domestic, flag and supplemental operations. The proposal provides different requirements 
based on the time of day, whether an individual is acclimated to a new time zone, and the 
likelihood of being able to sleep under different circumstances. 
FAA has determined the proposed rule:  (1) has benefits that justify its costs, (2)  
is an economically ―significant regulatory action‖ as defined in section 3(f) of Executive 
Order 12866, (3) is ―significant‖ as defined in DOT's Regulatory Policies and 
Procedures; (4) would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities; (5) would not create unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the 
United States; and (6) would impose an unfunded mandate on the private sector. 
Based on the FAA safety effectiveness assessment for this proposed rule to 
prevent pilot fatigue accidents, we estimate a total benefit of $659 million ($ million at 
present value, over 10 years).  Our rule requirements began with the recommendation 
from labor and industry and we then applied fatigue science to maximize benefits relative 
to costs.  The total estimated costs of the proposed rule over 10 years are $1.25 billion 
 2 
 
($804 million at present value).  There is over a 7 percent probability that undiscounted 
benefits of averting passenger airplane accidents would exceed $1.25 billion and over a 
10 percent probability the present value of the benefits of averting cargo airplane 
accidents would exceed $804 million.  The benefits from a single near-term prevented 
catastrophic accident of a common 150-passenger airplane with an average load factor 
would exceed the present value cost of this rule.  If the value of an averted fatality were 
increased to $12.6 million, the present value of the benefits would equal the present value 
of compliance costs.  The FAA invites comments on the methodology, data, and 
assumptions employed in this analysis.

Benefits Analysis 
Background & History 
The NTSB’s list of Most Wanted Transportation Safety Improvements includes 
safety recommendations about pilot fatigue.  These recommendations are based on 
accident investigations and an NTSB safety study on commuter airline safety.  The first 
 3 
 
NTSB recommendations to the FAA about pilot fatigue rulemaking occurred after the 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, accident on August 18, 1993.  In that accident, three flight crew 
members were seriously injured and the airplane was destroyed.  The captain lost control 
of the airplane while on approach to the U.S Naval Air Station at Guantanamo.  The 
NTSB listed as a probable cause of the accident the impaired judgment, decision-making, 
and flying abilities of the captain and flight crew because of fatigue.  The flight crew had 
been on duty for 18 hours and had flown for 9 hours.  The NTSB recommended the FAA 
revise part 121 to require that ―tail end‖ ferry flights be included in flight crews’ flight 
time and duty time (A-94-105).  The NTSB also recommended the FAA revise the 
flight/duty time limitations in its regulations to ensure the regulations incorporate the 
results of the latest research on fatigue and sleep issues (A-94-106). 
The NTSB’s list of Most Wanted Transportation Safety Improvements includes 
another safety recommendation on pilot fatigue and ferry flights conducted under 14 CFR 
part 91.  On February 19, 1995, three flight crew members died after a Douglas DC–8–63 
operated by Air Transport International was destroyed by ground impact and fire during 
an attempted three engine takeoff at Kansas City International Airport in Kansas City, 
Missouri.  The NTSB noted the flight crew conducted the flight as a maintenance ferry 
flight under part 91 after a shortened rest break following a demanding round-trip flight 
to Europe that crossed multiple time zones.  The NTSB further noted the international 
flight, conducted under part 121, involved multiple legs flown at night following daytime 
rest periods.  In addition, the NTSB found the captain’s last rest period before the 
accident was repeatedly interrupted by the certificate holder. 
 4 
 
In issuing its 1995 recommendations, the NTSB stated the flight time limits and 
rest requirements under part 121 that applied to the flight crew before the ferry flight did 
not apply to the ferry flight operated under part 91.  The NTSB found the regulations 
allowed a substantially reduced flight crew rest period for the nonrevenue ferry flight.  
Because of the investigation, the NTSB reiterated earlier recommendations to (1) finalize 
the review of current flight and duty time limitations to ensure the limitations consider 
research findings in fatigue and sleep issues and (2) prohibit certificate holders from 
assigning a flight crew to flights conducted under part 91 unless the flight crew meets the 
flight and duty time limits under part 121 or other applicable regulations (A–95–113).  
Since this recommendation there have been additional accidents in which flight crew 
fatigue was a contributing factor in the accident. 
On July 26, 2002, a Federal Express flight 1478, B727-232F, struck trees on 
approach and crashed short on the runway at the Tallahassee Regional Airport, 
Tallahassee, FL.  The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the 
flight crew’s failure to establish and maintain a proper glidepath during the night visual 
approach to landing.  The NTSB also determined that the captain’s and first officer’s 
fatigue contributed to the accident.  Three flight crew members were seriously injured 
and the airplane was destroyed.  The NTSB mentioned flightcrew fatigue as a factor 
contributing to the accident.  In February 2006, the NTSB issued safety recommendations 
after a BAE–J3201 operated under part 121 by Corporate Airline struck trees on final 
approach and crashed short of the runway at Kirksville Regional Airport, Kirksville, 
Missouri.  The captain, first officer, and 11 of the 13 passengers were fatally injured.  The 
 5 
 
NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilots’ failure to follow 
established procedures and properly conduct a nonprecision instrument approach at night 
in instrument meteorological conditions.  The NTSB concluded that fatigue likely 
contributed to the pilots’ performance and decision making based on the less than optimal 
overnight rest time available to the pilots, the early reporting time for duty, the number of 
flight legs, and the demanding conditions faced during the long duty day. 
Because of these accidents, the NTSB issued the following safety 
recommendations related to flight and duty time limitations:  (1) modify and simplify the 
flight crew hours-of-service regulations to consider factors such as length of duty day, 
starting time, workload, and other factors shown by recent research, scientific evidence, 
and current industry experience to affect crew alertness (A–06–10); and (2) require all 
part 121 and part 135 certificate holders to incorporate fatigue-related information similar 
to the information being developed by the DOT Operator Fatigue Management Program 
into initial and recurrent pilot training programs.  The recommendation notes that this 
training should address the detrimental effects of fatigue and include strategies for 
avoiding fatigue and countering its effects (A–06–11). 
There have also been some incidents in which the NTSB cited flight crew fatigue 
as a cause.  On February 18, 2007, Delta Connection flight 6448, operated by Shuttle 
America, Inc., overran the runway at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, 
Cleveland, OH (no fatalities and no serious injuries).  On April 12, 2007, Pinnacle 
Airlines flight 4712 overran the runway at Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City, 
Michigan (no fatalities and no serious injuries).  On February 13, 2008, Go! Flight 1002, 
 6 
 
operated by Mesa Airlines, flew past its destination airport at Hilo, Hawaii – the flight 
crew fell asleep while in-flight (no fatalities and no serious injuries). 
The current FAA rules in part 121 do not prescribe duty limits; rather they focus 
on flight time limits and rest requirements.  Flight time limits and rest requirements vary 
based on the type of operation.  The requirements in these subparts apply to domestic, 
flag, and supplemental operations.  Under the current rules for domestic operations, 
flightcrew members must receive at least an 8-hour rest period during the 24-hour period 
before the end of each flight.  Flightcrew members conducting flights under part 121 for 
domestic operations are limited to 30 hours of flight time in any seven consecutive days.  
The 7-consecutive-day limit for flag operations is 32 flight hours, and there is no 7-
consecutive-day limit for supplemental operations.  In addition, part 121 limits the flight 
time of flightcrew members engaged in domestic operations to 1,000 hours in any 
calendar year.  Flightcrew members engaged in flag and supplemental operations are 
limited to 1,000 hours in any 12-calendar-month period.  There is a quarterly and semi-
annual limit of 500 hours and 800 hours, respectively, for unscheduled operations.  
Operators are required to provide each crewmember a minimum of 24 consecutive hours 
of rest during any seven consecutive days for all domestic, flag, and supplemental 
operations conducted under part 121. 
On June 10, 2009, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator 
J. Randolph Babbitt testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security on 
Aviation Safety on the FAA’s role in the oversight of certificate holders.  He addressed 
 7 
 
issues on flightcrew member training and qualifications, flightcrew fatigue, and 
consistency of safety standards and compliance between air transportation certificate 
holders.  He also committed to assess the safety of the air transportation system and to 
take appropriate steps to improve it. 
In June 2009, the FAA convened the Flight and Duty Time Limitations and Rest 
Requirements Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC).  The FAA tasked the ARC to 
develop recommendations for an FAA rule based on current fatigue science and a review 
of international approaches to the issue.  The ARC submitted its recommendations to the 
FAA on September 10, 2009. 
Summary of Scientific Presentations 
To achieve the goal of developing proposed rules to enhance flightcrew member 
alertness and employ fatigue mitigation strategies, the ARC reviewed scientific 
information presented by experts in sleep, fatigue, and human performance research.  
Below is a summary of the scientific presentations: 
1. Fatigue 
Fatigue is characterized by a general lack of alertness and degradation in mental 
and physical performance.  There are three types of fatigue:  transient, cumulative, and 
circadian.  Transient fatigue is acute fatigue brought on by extreme sleep restriction or 
extended hours awake within 1 or 2 days.  Cumulative fatigue is fatigue brought on by 
repeated mild sleep restrictions or extended hours awake across a series of days.  
 8 
 
Circadian fatigue refers to the reduced performance during nighttime hours, particularly 
during the window of circadian low (WOCL). 
There is no direct measure or physiological marker that shows when a person is 
fatigued, although biomedical data may indicate physiological conditions favorable to 
fatigue.  Fatigue is often accompanied by drowsiness but is more than just being sleepy or 
tired.  Common symptoms of fatigue include: 
 Measurable decrease in speed and accuracy of performance, 
 Lapses of attention and vigilance, 
 Delayed reactions, 
 Impaired logical reasoning and decision making, including a reduced ability to 
assess risk or understand effects of actions, 
 Reduced situational awareness, and 
 Low motivation to perform optional activities. 
Various factors contribute to whether an individual experiences fatigue and the 
severity of fatigue experienced.  The major factors affecting fatigue include: 
 Time of day.  Fatigue is, in part, a function of circadian rhythms.  Human 
waking and sleep cycles follow a 24-hour cyclical wave pattern known as the 
internal body clock (circadian rhythm).  The circadian rhythm is closely 
correlated to core body temperatures.  All other factors being equal, fatigue is 
most likely, and, when present, most severe, during the WOCL, when body 
temperatures are at their lowest, during a four hour period between the hours 
of 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM.  Studies have found that subjects remaining 
awake through the WOCL and into the daytime hours experience 
improvements in performance once past the WOCL, relative to their 
performance during the WOCL. 
 Amount of recent sleep.  If a person has had significantly less than 8 hours of 
sleep in the past 24 hours, he or she is more likely to be fatigued. 
 Time awake.  A person who has been continuously awake more than 17 hours 
since his or her last major sleep period is more likely to be fatigued. 
 Cumulative sleep debt.  Sleep debt refers to the impact of receiving less than a 
full night’s sleep for multiple days.  For the average person, cumulative sleep 
debt is the difference between the sleep a person has received over the past 
several days, and the sleep they would have received if they obtained 8 hours 
 9 
 
of sleep per night.  For example, a person who has received 10 hours of sleep 
over the past 2 nights has a cumulative sleep debt of 6 hours.  A person with a 
cumulative sleep debt of more than 8 hours since his or her last full night of 
sleep is more likely to be fatigued.   
 Time on task.  The longer a person has continuously been doing a job without 
a break, the more likely he or she is to be fatigued. 
 Individual variation.  Different individuals will respond to fatigue factors 
differently.  Different individuals may become fatigued at different times, and 
to different degrees of severity, under the same circumstances. 
There often is interplay between various factors contributing to fatigue.  For 
example, the performance of a person working night and early morning shifts is impacted 
by the time of day.  Also, because of difficulty in obtaining normal sleep during other 
than nighttime hours, such a person is more likely to have a cumulative sleep debt or to 
not have obtained a full night’s sleep within the past 24 hours. 
2. Fatigue in Aviation 
Several aviation-specific work schedule factors
1
 can affect sleep and subsequent 
alertness.  These include early start times, extended work periods, insufficient time off 
between work periods, insufficient recovery time off between consecutive work periods, 
amount of work time within a shift or duty period, insufficient time off between work 
periods, number of consecutive work periods, night work through one’s window of 
circadian low, daytime sleep periods, and day-to-night or night-to-day transitions.

3. Preventing and Mitigating Sleep Debt 
Scientific research and experimentation has consistently showed that adequate 
sleep sustains performance.  For most people, 8 hours of sleep in each 24 hours sustains 
performance indefinitely.  Sleep opportunities during the WOCL are preferable, although 
some research suggests the total amount of sleep obtained is more important than the 
timing of sleep within the day.  When a person has accumulated a sleep debt, recovery 
sleep is necessary.  Recovery sleep requires an opportunity to obtain enough sleep to 
fully restore the person’s ―sleep reservoir.‖  Recovery sleep should include at least one 
physiological night, that is, one sleep period during nighttime hours in the time zone in 
which the individual is acclimated.  Recovery sleep does not require additional sleep 
equal to the cumulative sleep debt; that is, an 8-hour sleep debt does not require 8 
additional hours of sleep.  However, sleep on recovery days should be extended beyond 
the usual sleep amount.  The average person needs over 9 hours of sleep per night to 
recover from a sleep debt. 
This analysis looks at the projected costs and benefits of the FAA’s NPRM on 
flight duty and rest requirements for flightcrew members of air carriers in part 121.  The 
proposal is primarily based upon the work and discussions within the ARC along with the 
NTSB recommendations.  For the detailed discussion of the proposal and the discussion 
of the exact requirements the reader should see the NPRM that is filed in the docket.   
 11 
 
Benefits 
The scientific community recognizes there is a complex relationship between pilot 
performance and safety risk, and how the performance is impacted by pilot schedules.  
Investigations of pilot work variables have explored how they affect crewmember 
alertness, how alertness affects crew performance under differing workloads and 
operational environments, and how pilot work variables and alertness combine to affect 
safety performance that is measured by accidents and incidents.

In 1980, in response to a congressional request, the NASA Ames Research Center 
created a Fatigue/Jet Lag Program to study fatigue.  In a Technical Memorandum in 
1995, the Center concluded the average sleep requirement is 8 hours in a 24-hour period.
3
  
As another example, a study by Rosekind and others states that most humans need about 
eight hours of sleep per night.
4
  In addition, Battelle Memorial Institute reviewed the 
scientific literature on fatigue in a study for the FAA.  This review found that most 
researchers recommend an adult needs an average of 7.5 to 8 hours sleep a day.  The 
available scientific literature has identified several symptoms that indicate the presence of 
fatigue, including: increased anxiety, decreased short-term memory, slowed reaction 
time, decreased work efficiency, decreased vigilance, and increased errors.

Benefit Overview 
The approach of this benefits analysis begins with a search of the historical record 
of accidents to establish the extent of the fatigue problem.  First, there is some evidence 
that pilots are knowingly flying tired or should know that they are flying tired.  Since 
1990, the NTSB has identified five pilot error accidents in which lack of adequate sleep 
was a contributing factor in causing the accident.  Second, comparing pilot error 
accidents to length of pilot duty periods indicates that pilot error accidents are more likely 
to occur after long periods on duty.  We have calculated the increased accidents occurring 
late in duty periods.   Third, if the duty period begins late in day, then pilots might be 
tired even though they are at the beginning of their duty period.  We have found accidents 
where this was the case.  Fourth, there is also evidence in the accident record where 
chronic fatigue may have been a contributing factor to the accident.  Last, the accident 
rate for takeoffs and landings that occur between midnight and 6:00 am is much higher 
than the accident rate for those operations that occur during the day time.  We have 
calculated the increased accidents that occur between midnight and 6:00 am.  
   Having projected the possible extent of fatigue based on the historical record, 
we estimate the likelihood of accidents happening in the future using simulation 
techniques.  We also use simulation techniques to estimate future casualties, which we 
monetize.  In this way, we estimate the potential benefits of the proposed rule. 
 13 
 
. Finally, we model risk of fatigue for current pilot schedules, and compute the 
number of hours in higher risk categories with and without the rule. The projected 
reduction in fatigue exposure is corroborating evidence supporting this proposal. 
Receive Adequate Rest (Sleep) Between Duty Periods  
One of the goals of this rulemaking is to require part 121 operators to provide 
flightcrew members the opportunity to acquire an adequate rest before the start of their 
flight duty period.  In the past 20 years, there have been at least five accidents where the 
flightcrew members did not have an adequate amount of sleep prior to the start of their 
flight duty period. 
The first accident in the 20-year analysis period occurred at Pine Bluff, AR at 
3:55 PM on April 29, 1993.  An Embraer EMB120 RT, Brasilia, N24706, (operated by 
Continental Express, Inc.) was substantially damaged when it collided with rough terrain 
during an overrun following a forced landing.  The forced landing was executed 
following a stall and loss of control at 17,412 feet during climb.  After regaining control 
of the airplane the flightcrew noticed that the left engine nacelle was damaged and that 
three propeller blades were missing.  The airplane was unable to maintain level flight.  
After the flightcrew landed the airplane, it hydroplaned off the wet runway.  The airplane 
was substantially damaged as a result of overrunning the runway.  There were three 
crewmembers and 27 passengers on board the airplane.    The flight attendant and 12 
passengers received minor injuries; the others were uninjured.  The NTSB determined 
that pilot error was the cause of the accident. 
 14 
 
Contributing to the accident was fatigue induced by the flightcrew’s failure to 
properly manage their provided rest periods.  The flightcrew got off duty at 11:30 AM the 
day before the accident.  The captain went to bed between midnight and 12:30 AM and 
awoke about 5:00 AM (receiving only 4 ½ to 5 hours sleep) for a departure at 6:30 AM.  
The first officer went to bed between 11:00 PM and midnight and woke up about 4:30 
AM (receiving between 5 and 5 1/2 hours sleep).  Both pilots claimed they felt well 
rested prior to starting their flight duty for that day.  The accident flight occurred during 
the seventh and last flight of the day. 
The second accident occurred at 10:27 PM on February 16, 1995 at Kansas City, 
MO.  A Douglas DC-8-63, N782AL, operated by Air Transport International (ATI), was 
destroyed by ground impact and fire.  The accident occurred during a three-engine 
takeoff for a ferry flight under Part 91.  Three crew members were fatally injured.  The 
NTSB determined that the accident was due to pilot error.   
In addition to being inadequately trained, the flightcrew was suffering from 
fatigue as a result of limited opportunities for rest, disruption of their circadian rhythms, 
and lack of sleep in the days prior to the accident.  Before their assignment to the accident 
trip, the flightcrew had completed a demanding round-trip to Europe.  The flights crossed 
multiple time zones (12 in all) in a short period of time.  The Dover-Ramstein-Gander-
Dover legs were flown at night following daytime rest periods, which disrupted the 
flightcrew’s circadian rhythms.  On the day of the accident, the flightcrew had checked 
into a hotel in Dover, DE, at 2:40 AM EST.  The captain placed a short call from his 
room at 3:14 AM.  At 8:02 AM (receiving not quite 5 hours sleep), he called home and 
 15 
 
spoke to his wife for 25 minutes.  ATI Scheduling called the captain at 10:30 AM.  There 
were other calls between ATI and the captain throughout the day (10:45 AM, 12:44 PM, 
2:00 PM, and 2:10 PM).  The flightcrew departed Dover at 3:18 PM EST and arrived at 
Kansas City at 5:39 PM CST. 
The flightcrew was required to take a 16 hour rest period before they could be 
assigned any additional part 121 duties.  However, there are no flight time limits or rest 
requirements for Part 91 ferry flights that follow Part 121 revenue flights.  So 12 hours 
after checking into a hotel at Dover, the flightcrew checked out to assume duty under Part 
91 ferry flight rules. 
The third accident in the 20-year analysis period occurred on May 8, 1999 at 7:01 
AM EST.  A Saab-Scania AB (Saab), N232AE, operated by American Eagle Airlines, 
INC., overran the runway at John F Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, NY.  The 
captain conducted an ILS approach with excessive altitude, airspeed, and rate of descent, 
while remaining above the glide slope.  The airplane landed 7,000 feet beyond the 
approach end of the runway, at excessive speed (157 knots), and overran the runway.  
One passenger was seriously injured while exiting the airplane, the other passengers and 
crewmembers were uninjured. The airplane was substantial damaged by the accident. 
The NTSB determined that pilot error caused the accident.  During the post 
accident interviews, both pilots stated that they were fatigued.  The flightcrew was 
working a continuous duty overnight schedule.   The previous day, they both woke up 
during the morning, did not sleep during the day, and reported for duty at 11:00 PM for a 
 16 
 
flight scheduled at 11:46 PM.  The day before the accident, the flight was delayed and 
arrived at BWI around 1:00 AM.  They got to sleep around 1:30 AM and awoke at 4:45 
AM for the accident flight, which was scheduled to depart at 6:10 AM. 
The fourth accident occurred at Tallahassee, FL on July 26, 2002 at 5:37 AM 
EST.  A Boeing 727-23F, N497FE, operated by Federal Express (FedEx) struck some 
trees and landed short of the runway.  All three flightcrew members were seriously 
injured.  The airplane was destroyed by impact and the resulting fire.  The NTSB 
determined that the accident was caused by pilot error.  Both the captain and the first 
officer were fatigued at the time of the accident.  The captain had only 3 ½ hours of sleep 
prior to the accident. He had disturbed, interrupted sleep on the two previous nights.  The 
first officer, who was on reserve duty, reported that he was having difficulty adjusting his 
sleep cycle to the reserve-duty schedule.  His reserve-duty schedule caused him to 
frequently change his sleep pattern between sleeping during daytime hours and night 
hours.  He had approximately 5 to 6 hours sleep before reporting for duty. The flight 
engineer had received about 6 ½ hours sleep before he began his duty and had taken two 
naps (30 minutes on a commute to Memphis, TN, and 30 to 60 minutes at FedEx’s crew 
rest facility at Memphis airport). 
The fifth accident occurred at 3:06 PM EST on February 18, 2007 at Cleveland, 
Ohio.  An Embraer ERJ-170, N862RW, operated by Shuttle America, Inc. as Delta 
Connection flight 6448, landed during snow conditions and overran the end of the 
runway.  Three passengers received minor injuries; the remaining 68 passengers and 4 
 17 
 
crew members were uninjured.  The NTSB determined that the accident was caused by 
pilot error.  Contributing to the accident was the captain’s fatigue. 
On the day of the accident the captain had received only 45 minutes to an hour of 
sleep.  The captain had reported that he was too tired to fly on July 30, 2006.  The Shuttle 
America chief pilot and ERJ-170 program manager told him fatigue calls made outside 
duty times would result in an unavailable attendance mark.  On January 16, 2007 Shuttle 
America notified the pilot in writing that his attendance had reached an unacceptable 
level – nine absences occurrences (seven sick and two unavailable attendance marks) 
totaling 18 days within the previous 12 months – and that future occurrences would result 
in corrective action, which could include termination from the company.  According to 
company policy eight absence occurrences would result in termination.  Since the captain 
had not received any previous notification from Shuttle America about his attendance 
record he had not yet been terminated.  The captain stated that he did not cancel his trip 
due to fatigue because he thought he would be fired. 
In the five accidents discussed above, the captains (and sometimes the other 
flightcrew members) were operating their airplanes while they were fatigued and they 
knew that they were fatigued (or should have known that that they were fatigued).    The 
new requirements of this rulemaking, including increased training, would prevent these 
accidents from happening in the future.

Duty Time Limits 
In analyzing this rulemaking action, the FAA conducted an assessment of the 
risks of pilot work practices and the risk of a part 121 accident.
5
  Human factors-related 
accidents from the 1990 to 2009 time period were identified that involved, at a minimum, 
substantial damage to the aircraft or serious injuries to those on-board.  All turbulence-
related accidents were excluded, as were accidents that did not have a 72-hour history of 
pilot activities before the accident.  There were 43 accidents where the needed data were 
available (sometimes slightly more or fewer than 43 accidents depending on the 
schedule-related risk factor of interest).  The FAA believes that these accidents are 
representative of all the major human factor-caused accidents that occurred during the 
period, including all accidents where fatigue was a factor. 
As part of the analysis for this rulemaking, the FAA obtained data on pilot work 
patterns from six carriers covering two months of actual flight activity during 2009.  The 
six carriers that provided flight crew duty schedule data included three large legacy 
passenger carriers that conduct both international and domestic operations (one of which 
includes elements of a low cost domestic carrier and two large cargo carriers that conduct 
both international and domestic air cargo services.  For the following analysis, these data 
were used to create profiles of the work patterns of the pilots from these six airlines.  The 
data were converted (for each month) into one record for each pilot with a line of actual 
flying for one or both of the months.  Each pilot record tracked a pilot’s activity for every

hour in the entire month that the pilot was on duty.  The beginning and end of each trip 
segment were recorded for each pilot and put into a database.  Parameters of interest were 
then calculated such as the length of duty periods, the day within a duty trip on which 
duty hours take place and the numbers of takeoffs and landings within a duty period.  The 
analysis tracked these activities in base time (defined as the time at the location where the 
pilot began a multi-day trip, which is often the pilot’s crew base). The analyses provide 
support for regulatory proposals to govern duty time.

  Specifically, it was found that the

It is important to note that pilots are only at risk of suffering an air accident during those duty 
hours when they are actually operating an aircraft.  Therefore, the first hour of a pilot’s duty day 
– spent (as indicated by industry practice and the data provided by carriers for this analysis) 
engaged in ground activities such as check in, flight and schedule information acquisition and 
pre-departure inspections of aircraft – does not represent duty time “at risk” of an air accident.  
Similarly, once each pilot has concluded the first flight segment of his or her duty day, some 
percentage of the pilot’s duty time is spent on the ground between actual flight segments.  This 
time spent on duty but on the ground is also duty time that is not “at risk” of an air accident.  
After adjusting for the first duty hour, about 75 percent of pilot duty hours are spent operating 
an aircraft and thus “at risk” of an air accident.  For the statistical analyses presented below, the 
pilot duty time data has been adjusted to reflect this.  Adjustments are done on the reported 
pilot duty data in the following way.   
 The first hour of the pilot duty day is excluded, since it is not an hour of duty “at risk” of 
an air accident 
 After this first hour each pilot begins his or her first flight segment of the day.  The 
length of this first flight segment varies from pilot to pilot, depending on the day’s 
itinerary.  Therefore the second duty hour of each pilot’s duty period is treated as if it is 
an “at risk” duty hour for each pilot, so the total number of second duty hours is not 
adjusted in any way. 
 During the third through eighth duty hours, some pilots are at times on the ground 
between segments (and thus are not “at risk”), some have resumed flying their second, 
third, fourth or greater flight segment of the day (and are therefore “at risk”), some 
continue to fly throughout a long first flight segment of the day (and are therefore “at 
risk”), and so forth.  Over these hours of the duty period, individual pilots spend some 
duty time on the ground and not “at risk” and the remainder of the duty time operating 
an aircraft and therefore “at risk.”  It is not possible to capture the actual variability in 
 
 20 
 
proportion of accidents is higher for more lengthy duty periods than is the proportion of 
lengthy duty periods in the pilot sample.  This is illustrated in Table 1 where about 6 
percent of pilot duty hours are in the 11
th
 or greater hour of a duty period while 16 
percent of accidents that occur happen in the 11
th
 or greater hour of the pilot’s duty 
period.  Similarly, nine percent of the accidents occur when a pilot has been on duty for 
13 or more hours whereas just a little over one percent of pilot duty hours occur during 
that time.  This analysis points to increased accident risk with increased duty time, even 
though pilot scheduling was not cited as a factor in all 43 accidents. 
This analysis is also consistent with a study of pilot deviations by duty time 
within the past 24-hours (see Appendix A).  In this study the portion of pilot deviations 
was greater than the exposure portion when duty time exceeded 6 hours during the past 
24-hours.  These findings and the analysis above suggest that more stringent limits on 
pilot duty time would be appropriate.

the pilot duty data, so for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth duty hours, 
the reported duty hour counts are reduced by 30 percent to account for this 
“sometimes ‘at risk,’ sometimes not ‘at risk’” nature of this portion of the duty day. (This 
30 percent adjustment factor for those hours of the duty period exceeds the observed 
25 percent difference between flight time and duty time because no adjustment is 
made to the duty hours observed in the final hours of pilot duty periods.) 
 For the ninth and greater duty hours in the pilot duty day, it is assumed that all pilots 
still on duty have commenced and are completing their final flight segment of the day, 
and are therefore “at risk” of an air accident during these duty hours. 
The adjusted exposure data set is reported in Table 1 and is used for calculations reported in Table 2. 
 
7
 It also should be noted that many union contracts today require periods of flight time, duty time, and 
rest time which are more stringent than the requirements established by the existing, and in some cases 
the proposed, Federal Aviation Regulations. However, our analysis is based on a mix of carriers including 
those with more stringent contracts.

It is possible to estimate the number of accidents that could have been avoided by 
limiting the duty time of pilots using the information in Table 2.  If fatigue was not a 
contributing factor in the 36 accidents that occurred during one of the first ten hours of 
pilot duty, then the relationship between the exposure data compiled for captains and the 
―normal‖ frequency of occurrence of serious accidents can be estimated as 3.69 accidents 
per 100,000 hours of duty time.
 8
   There were 53,611 hours of duty in the exposure data 
set that occurred during the 11
th
 and 12
th
 duty hour of a pilot’s duty period; and based on 
                                                          
8
 To calculate the factor for accidents per 100,000 hours of exposure data, the total number of duty hours 
in the exposure data in the tenth hour of a duty period and earlier is calculated, as [(192,786 + 310,045 + 
211,474 + 152,671 + 108,084) = 975,060 duty hours] .  Of the accidents, 36 occurred while the pilot was in 
the tenth or earlier hour of a duty period.  This accident number of 36 divided by the exposure total of 
975,060 hours results in an accidents-per-100,000 exposure hours ratio of 3.69. 
 22 
 
the calculated frequency relationship (3.69 accidents per 100,000 hours of duty time) 
1.98 accidents would be expected to occur, and three accidents did occur during those 
hours of a pilot’s duty period.  In the 13th and 14th duty hour there were only 10,010 hours 
of duty.  The expected number of accidents at the above rate would be 0.4 for that time 
period, while one accident occurred involving a pilot in that range of the duty period 
length.  Since there were only 1,003 hours of duty occurring in the 15
th
 and greater hours 
of duty, only 0.1 accidents would be expected during those hours of the duty period.  In 
the dataset there are three accidents involving a pilot with a duty period of this length. 
Table 2 shows the projected number of accidents estimated in this way in comparison with the actual 
number of accidents.  The difference between the actual number of accidents and the projected number of 
accidents would be the number of accidents that may be avoided for that time in duty period category.  For 
example, in the 11
th
 and 12th hour, there were three accidents,
9
 and 1.98 was projected to occur; so there is 
a difference of 1.02 accidents.  Similarly, in the 13
th
 and 14th hour, there was one accident,
10
 while only 0.4 
were projected to occur; the difference (or possible number of accidents avoided) is 0.6 accidents.  Finally, 
in the 15
th
 and greater hours of duty, there were three accidents,
11
 while only 0.1 were projected to occur 
based on the distribution of duty hours; the difference (or possible number of accidents avoided) is 2.9 
accidents.

A rule that limits duty time to 14 hours could avoid 2.96 accidents.  If the limit on 
duty time were set at 12 hours, then 3.6 accidents could be avoided.  If the limit on duty 
time were set at 10 hours, then 4.6 accidents could be avoided. 
In Appendix B, two methods were used to test the statistical significance of the 
relationship between length of duty time and accidents.  Both tests showed that the 
relationship was statistically significant.  The FAA requests comments on the content of 
Appendix B. 
Since 1990, there have been seven serious accidents where pilot fatigue due to a 
long duty period was a contributing factor.  These accidents resulted in 24 fatalities to 
passengers and crew members, 52 serious injuries to passengers and crew members, and 
 24 
 
65 minor injuries to passengers and crew members.  There were also 76 passengers and 
crew members in these seven accidents who were not injured. 
The first accident occurred on August 18, 1993, when a Douglas DC-8-61 
freighter operated by American International Airways collided with level terrain short of 
the runway at Leeward Point Airfield, Guantanamo.  The accident happened at 1656 EDT 
when the pilot lost control of the airplane while on approach.  All three crew members 
were seriously injured and the airplane was destroyed.  The NTSB determined that pilot 
error was the probable cause of the accident and that pilot fatigue was a contributing 
factor. 
This is the first Part 121 accident where NTSB cited pilot fatigue as a contributing 
factor.  At the time of the accident, the flight crew had been on duty for about 18 hours.  
On the day of the accident, the captain had been awake for over 23 hours with only five 
hours of sleep prior to waking up.  The first officer had been awake 19 hours with 8 hours 
of sleep, and the flight engineer had been awake 21 hours with 6 hours of sleep.  The day 
before the accident, the captain and first office had only two hours of sleep prior to being 
awake for over 17 hours. 
The second accident occurred on January 22, 1999, when a Beech 1900D 
operated by Colgan Air, Inc. was substantially damaged while landing at Barnstable 
Airport, Hyannis, MA.  The accident happened at 1719 EST.  There were no injuries to 
the two crew members and the two passengers.  The NTSB determined that pilot error 
 25 
 
was the probable cause.   On the day of the accident the captain had reported for duty at 
535 EST.  At the time of the accident the captain had been on duty almost 12 hours. 
The third accident occurred on June 1, 1999, when a McDonnell Douglas DC- 9-
82 (MD-82) operated by American Airlines crashed after it overran the end of runway 
during a landing at Little Rock National Airport, Little Rock, AR.  The accident 
happened at 2350 CDT.  At the time of the accident there were thunderstorms in the 
airport area and the runway was wet.  The captain and 10 passengers were fatally injured; 
four crew members and 41 passengers were seriously injured, one crew member and 64 
passengers received minor injuries; and 24 passengers were uninjured.  The airplane was 
destroyed by impact and a postcrash fire.  The NTSB determined that pilot error was the 
probable cause and that fatigue was a contributing factor. 
On the day of the accident, the captain awoke at 715 and reported for duty at 
1038.  At the time of the accident he had been awake for over 16 hours and had been on 
duty for over 13 hours.  The first officer had also been awake for over 16 hours and on 
duty for over 13 hours. 
The fourth accident occurred on October 19, 2004, when a BAE-J3201 operated 
by Corporate Airlines as an American Connection struck some trees on final approach to 
Kirksville Regional Airport, Kirksville, MO and crashed short of the runway.  The 
accident occurred at 1937 CDT.  The crew and 11 passengers were fatally injured and 
two passengers received serious injuries.  The airplane was destroyed by impact and post 
 26 
 
crash fire.  The NTSB determined that pilot error was the probable cause of this accident 
and that fatigue was a contributing factor. 
On the day of the accident, the pilots were flying their sixth flight of the day and 
had flown 6 hours and 14 minutes when the accident occurred.  They had also been on 
duty for 14 hours and 31 minutes at the time of the accident.  The night before the 
accident, the captain had not slept well and awoke with a headache, according to his 
fiancée who talked with him during the morning by telephone. 
The fifth accident occurred on December 16, 2004, when a Short Brothers SD3-
60 aircraft operated by Air Cargo Carriers, Inc. as a chartered cargo flight attempted a 
landing at the Oshawa Municipal Airport, Oshawa, Canada.  The crew rejected the 
landing after noticing poor breaking action and tried to conduct a go-around.  After 
becoming airborne the aircraft crashed after striking the airport boundary fence.  The 
accident happened about 2000 EST.  The two pilots received serious injuries and the 
aircraft was substantially damaged.  The Transportation Safety Board of Canada 
determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the accident. 
The captain of the aircraft had been awake for 13 hours and had been performing 
duties as a flight crewmember for 10 hours before the accident.  The captain was flying 
the aircraft at the time of the accident.  The first officer had been awake for 12 hours and 
had been performing the duties as a flight crewmember for nine hours. 
The sixth accident occurred on April 12, 2007, when a Bombardier/Canadair 
Regional Jet (CRJ) CL600-2B19 operated by Pinnacle Airlines ran off the departure end 
 27 
 
of runway 28 after landing at Cherry Capital Airport, Traverse City, MI.  The accident 
occurred at 0043 EDT.  There were no injuries, but the airplane was substantially 
damaged.  The NTSB determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the accident 
and that fatigue was a contributing factor. 
On April 11, the captain awoke about 0700 CDT and ate breakfast at the hotel.  
Both the captain and first officer left the hotel at 0800 CDT taking a shuttle to the airport.  
Both started their duty day at 0900 CDT on April 11, 2007.  At the time of the accident 
both crew members had been on duty for 15 hours and 43 minutes (and the captain had 
been awake for over 17 hours. 
The seventh accident occurred on June 20, 2007, when a Beech 1900D operated 
by Great Lakes Air ran off the runway after landing at Laramie Regional Airport, 
Laramie, WY.  The accident occurred at 1620 MDT.  There were no injuries, but the 
aircraft was substantially damaged.  The NTSB determined that pilot error was the 
probable cause of the accident. 
On the day of the accident, the captain and first officer were on the third day of a 
three day trip.  The crew started their duty period at 0520 MDT.  At the time of the 
accident, they had been on duty for 11 hours. 
These seven accidents resulted in 24 fatalities to passengers and crew members, 
52 serious injuries to passengers and crew members, and 65 minor injuries to passengers 
and crew members.  There were also 76 passengers and crew members in these seven 
accidents who were not injured. 
 28 
 
 
Time Awake 
While being on duty a long time can be fatiguing, simply being awake a long time 
(approximately 17 hours or more) can also be fatiguing.  In some accidents, the pilots had 
been on duty less than 10 hours, but those hours occurred late in the day and one or more 
of the flight crewmembers had been awake close to 17 hours or more.  In the three 
accidents described below, statements of probable cause indicated crew performance but 
in each case one or more of the flight crewmembers had been awake a long time.  These 
three accidents resulted in 245 fatalities on board the airplane and one fatality on the 
ground.  There were also 20 seriously injured passenger and crew members, and three 
crew members and a passenger that received minor injuries. 
The first accident occurred on July 2, 1994, when a DC-9-31 airplane operated by 
USAir, Inc. collided with tree and a private residence near Charotte/Douglas International 
Airport.  This accident occurred at about 1843 EDT shortly after the flightcrew executed 
a missed ILS approach.  There were 37 passenger fatalities, 16 passenger and crew 
received serious injuries, and 4 crew and a passenger received minor injuries.  The 
airplane was destroyed by impact and a postcrash fire.  The NTSB determined that pilot 
error was the probable cause of the accident. 
Fatigue likely affected the performance of the first officer, who was the pilot-
flying on the accident leg.  The captain, who was off-duty the preceding 3 days, was less 
vulnerable to fatigue, but he too had already had a long day.  The accident occurred 14 
 29 
 
hours into the captain’s day.  He had risen at 0455, drove to Dayton from his home, then 
flew to Pittsburgh to begin his duty day.  The accident occurred at 1843, at the end of the 
third of 4 scheduled legs.   
The first officer was more vulnerable to fatigue.  He was on a four-day trip.  On 
July 30, he ended his duty day at Tri-City Regional Airport, Biountville, Tennessee, 
where he had arrived at 2230. The NTSB report does not state when that duty day began, 
nor when the first officer awoke that day.  However, after having a light meal, he went to 
bed at 0130.  On July 1, he awoke at 0900.  His duty day ended July 1 in Saint Louis at 
2040 EDT.  He went to bed at 2230 and awoke at 0615 on the accident day.  He reported 
for duty at St. Louis for a flight to Pittsburgh.  That flight, with the first officer as the 
pilot flying, departed at 0810.  At Pittsburgh, the first officer joined the captain and they 
began their pairing.  Like the captain, the first officer was nearly 14 hours into his day 
when the accident occurred.  He was the pilot flying on the PIT-LGA leg and on the 
accident flight from CAE.   
The second accident occurred on December 20, 1995, when a Boeing 757-223 
operated by American Airlines crashed into mountainous terrain while on descent from 
cruise altitude in an attempt to land at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport in 
Cali, Columbia.  The accident occurred at 2142 EST.  There were 160 passenger and 
crew fatalities; only four passengers survived the accident with serious injuries.  The 
airplane was destroyed by impact.  The Aeronautica Civil of the Republic of Columbia 
determined that the probable cause was pilot error.   
 30 
 
The accident flight was the first flight for both pilots after several days off.  The 
captain arose at 0500 after a bit more than 7 hours of sleep.  The first officer awoke at 
0700.  Both pilots appeared well rested.  Both pilots reported to the operations manager at 
Miami more than an hour before their scheduled departure time of 1640.  However, 
departure from the gate was delayed until 1714, followed by a lengthy ground delay due 
to ramp congestion.   
It is reasonable to assume that the crew would have been tired at the time of the 
accident, despite this flight’s being the first of their duty tour.  The captain had been 
awake close to 17 hours, while the first officer had been awake 15 hours. 
The third accident occurred on February 12, 2009, when a Bombardier DHC-8-
400 operated by Colgan Air, Inc. as a Continental Connection flight crashed into a 
residence in Clarence Center, NY while on approach to Buffalo-Niagara International 
Airport, Buffalo, NY.  The accident occurred at 2217 EST.  The crew and passengers (49 
people) were all killed and one person on the ground was also killed.  The airplane was 
destroyed by impact and a postcrash fire.  The NTSB identified probable cause and 
contributing factors as follows: 
Both pilots performance was likely to have been impaired due to fatigue.  Both 
pilots were based at Newark and both commuted.  The captain lived near Tampa, FL and 
the first officer lived near Seattle, WA.  Neither had a ―crash pad‖ in Newark and both 
regularly used the crew room for sleeping.  The captain often tried to bid trips that would 
ensure some nights in hotels at out-stations.  In Newark, he sometimes stayed with a 
 31 
 
friend but usually slept in the crew room.  The first officer always slept in the crew room 
when in Newark and told several people she had no need for a crash pad because ―one of 
the sofas in the crew room has my name on it.‖ 
The duty tour began on February 10 for the recently upgraded captain.  He 
commuted to EWR on February 9 from his home near Tampa, arriving at EWR at 2005.  
He apparently spent the night in the crew room.  Multiple phone records and log-ins to 
the company’s crew tracking system indicate he got little sleep before reporting for duty 
at 0530 on February 10.  The captain then flew 3 flights and arrived at BUF at 1300.  He 
spent the rest of the day in a hotel.  On February 11, he left the hotel at 0515 to report for 
duty at 0615.  Again the captain flew 3 flights and terminated his duty day at EWR at 
1544.  He apparently spent the rest of the day and that night in the crew room, where he 
was seen sleeping at 0630 on February 12, the day of the accident.  Again, however, 
multiple phone records, log-ins to the crew tracking system, and contact with other 
employees indicate he got very limited sleep before reporting for duty at 1300. 
The first officer commuted to EWR from SEA the day before the accident.  She 
awoke on February 11 at 0900 and arrived at the airport at 1730 for a FedEx flight to 
MEM.  The aircraft arrived in MEM at 0230 EST (2230 PST).  She was said to have had 
about 90 minutes of sleep on the flight.  She then took another flight to EWR, departing 
MEM at 0418 and arriving at EWR at 0623.  She apparently slept for much of that two-
hour flight.  Upon reaching EWR, she spent the day in crew room, where she was seen 
napping.  However, multiple phone records and log-ins to the company’s crew tracking 
system indicate she got little sleep before reporting for duty at 1300. 
 32 
 
The NTSB did not cite fatigue as a cause or as a factor.  However, in its findings 
and conclusions, NTSB noted that the performance of both pilots ―was likely impaired 
because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it 
contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be 
conclusively determined.‖   
NTSB added that both pilots failed to manage their off-duty time and commute 
responsibly and both failed to ensure that they remained ―fit for duty.‖ 
The Captain was near the end of his fourth day since awakening on February 9.  
He had the opportunity for quality sleep only on the night of February 10, and that was 
cut short with a departure from the hotel at 0515 the next morning.  Both pilots 
essentially stayed up all night on February 11, with no opportunities for deep sleep, and 
then found themselves operating a late-night flight after a day of cancellations and delays. 
These three accidents resulted in 245 fatalities on board the airplane and one 
fatality on the ground.  There were also 20 seriously injured passenger and crew 
members, and three crew members and a passenger that received minor injuries.   
Chronic Fatigue 
Chronic fatigue can happen to a flight crewmember, if his or her duty periods 
covers several days of night flying, or several days of multiple time zone changes, or 
several days with a heavy schedule.  Chronic fatigue could be a contributing factor to 
accidents where pilot error was the probable cause of the accident.  In the two accidents 
 33 
 
described below, the NTSB determined that pilot error was the probable cause, but in 
each case one or more of the flight crewmembers was subject to chronic fatigue.  These 
two accidents resulted in two passengers who were seriously injured, and 38 crew 
members and a passenger who received minor injuries. 
The first accident occurred on April 14, 1993, when a DC-10-30 operated by 
American Airlines overran runway 17L following a landing at Dallas/Fort Worth 
International Airport. The accident happened at 0659 CDT.  It was raining at the time of 
the accident and there were numerous thunderstorms in the airport area. The airplane 
sustained substantial damage.  There were no fatalities, but two passengers received 
serious injuries, and 38 passengers and crew members received minor injuries.  The 
NTSB determined that the probable cause was ―the failure of the captain to use proper 
directional control techniques to maintain the airplane on the runway.‖    
Though the accident occurred just 46 hours into the crew’s duty tour, the crew 
was completing its second consecutive day of disrupted circadian rhythms.  The crew 
likely had awoken no later than 0600 CDT in order to reach DFW and report for duty in 
advance of their first flight at 0900 from DFW to Honolulu (HNL).  After a 10-hour duty 
day, the crew arrived at HNL at about 1900 CDT (1400 HAST) and began their sleep 
period around 2200 HAST, awakening around 0700 HAST, with additional naps of 
various lengths from 1600 to 2100 Local.  Then the crew reported for duty and flew for 
more than 8 hours through the night to DFW.   
 34 
 
The first officer told investigators that he felt tired twice during the flight and 
briefly used oxygen to ―perk-up.‖ The captain and the flight engineer said they did not 
feel tired during the flight, but the literature on sleep indicates that people often fail to 
recognize when their performance deteriorates due to fatigue and disrupted circadian 
rhythms.   
The second accident occurred on August 25, 1996, when a Lockheed L-1011-100 
operated by Trans World Airlines was substantially damaged when the tail struck the 
runway while landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport.  The accident occurred at 
0710 EDT.  None of the crew or passengers were injured.  The NTSB determined the 
probable cause of the accident was pilot error. 
Pilot fatigue was also a probable contributing factor in this accident.  The crew’s 
trip sequence began with an evening flight on August 23 from JFK to Las Vegas (LAS).  
The NTSB report is unclear about the time the crew arrived in LAS, but they appear to 
have reached their hotel around 2200 local time (0100 EDT), at which time the crew 
started a 24-hour rest period.   The crew’s itinerary resumed at 2130 (PDT) the next night 
when they were picked up at the hotel.  The crew therefore would have been awake at 
least since about 2000 (2300 EDT).  Though the crew had an ostensibly adequate rest 
period, they had arrived at their hotel late on the preceding night and were resuming their 
itinerary on the back side of the clock for a 5-hour red-eye to New York. 
These two accidents resulted in two passengers who were seriously injured, and 
38 crew members and a passenger who received minor injuries. 
 35 
 
Late Night Duty Fatigue 
Aviation accidents can also be examined how they vary through out the day.  As 
can be seen in Table 3 showing the 43 accidents in our analysis by time of day, accidents 
are more likely to occur in the late afternoon and early evening (4:00 pm to 8:00 pm) than 
any other time of the day.  During the rest of the day accidents are spread out fairly 
evenly among the four-hour categories.  Throughout most of the day there is a close 
relationship between the percentage of accidents that occurred during each four-hour 
period and the percentage of operations that occurred during the same four-hour period.  
However, between midnight and 4:00 AM, the percentage of accidents (14%) greatly 
exceed the percentage of operations (3%).

This analysis is also consistent with a study of pilot deviations by time-of-day 
(see Appendix C).  In this study the portion of pilot deviations was greater than the 
exposure portion between midnight and 4:00 am.  Both this study and the above analysis 
 36 
 
suggest that should be regulated to reduce the number of pilot error accidents where pilot 
fatigue was a contributing factor. 
It is possible to estimate the number of accidents that could have been avoided by 
regulating operations during the window of circadian low between 12:00 midnight and 
4:00 am using the information in Table 3.  If fatigue was not a contributing factor in the 
13 accidents that occurred between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm, then the relationship between 
the exposure data compiled for captains and the ―normal‖ frequency of occurrence of 
serious accidents can be estimated as 1.19 accidents per million operations.   There were 
708,610 operations between midnight and 4:00 am; and based on the calculated 
frequency relationship (1.19 accidents per million operations) 0.8 accidents would be 
expected to occur, and six accidents occurred during those hours.  Between 4:00 am and 
8:00 am there were 2.536 million operations.  The expected number of accidents at the 
above rate would be 3.0 accidents during those hours, but there were six accidents.  The 
excess accidents that occur in the late afternoon and evening have already been taken into 
account the earlier discussion in the sections preceding this section. 
Table 4 shows the projected number of accidents estimated in this way in 
comparison with the actual number of accidents.  The difference between the actual 
number of accidents and the projected number of accidents would be the number of 
accidents that may be avoided by regulating operations during those hours.  For example, 
between midnight and 4:00 am, there were six accidents,
12
 and 0.8 were projected to

occur; so there is a difference of 5.2 accidents.  Similarly, between 4:00 am and 8:00 am, 
there were six accidents,
13
 while 3.0 were projected to occur; the difference (or possible 
number of accidents avoided) is 2.98 accidents.

8 to mid 7            4.3   
       
              43         
A rule that regulated operations during the period of circadian low between 
midnight and 4:00 am could avoid 5.2 accidents.  If the time was extended to 6:00 am, 
then possibly 3.0 accidents could be avoided.  As it turns out, one of the accidents that 
occurred between midnight and 4:00 am, Traverse City (4/12/2007), has already been 
accounted for in the above analysis of length of duty time accidents, so it will not be 
claimed in this analysis.  Concerning the time between 4:00 am and 8:00 am, only one of 
the six accidents occurred when the window of circadian low was possible (between 4:00 
am and 6:00 am).  That accident happened at Tallahassee (7/26/2002), and it also was 
discussed above.  None of the accidents between 4:00 am and 8:00 am will be claimed in 
this analysis.

Operating an aircraft during the window of circadian low can be fatiguing.  The 
five accidents described below all occurred between midnight and 6:00 am.  These five 
accidents resulted in seven fatalities.  There were also 7 minor injuries passengers and 
crew members, and 77 crew members and a passenger that received minor injuries. 
The first accident occurred on February 17, 1991, when a McDonnell Douglas 
DC-9-15 freighter operated by Ryan International Airlines flew through weather 
conducive to airframe ice contaminations 40 minutes prior to descending toward 
Cleveland, OH.  During the 35 minute turnaround at Cleveland, the crew did not exit the 
airplane to conduct a preflight inspection of the airplane even though it was snowing at 
the time.  The airplane stalled on the takeoff and crashed. The accident happened at 00:19 
EST.  Both flight crewmembers were fatally injured.  The NTSB determined that pilot 
error was the probable cause of the accident.  
The second accident occurred February 15, 1992, when a Douglas DC-8-63  
operated by Air Transport International crashed on approach to the airport at Toledo, OH.  
The first officer had attempted two ILS approaches but failed to capture the ILS localizer 
and/or glideslope.  During the second approach the captain assumed control of the 
airplane.  The captain apparently became spatially disoriented and failed to properly 
recognize and recover from an unusual aircraft attitude.  The second officer assumed 
control of the aircraft but was unable to recover the airplane before it crashed.  The 
accident occurred at 3:27 EST.  The captain, first officer, and two other people were 
fatally injured.  The NTSB determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the 
accident. 
 39 
 
The third accident occurred on November 12, 1995, when a McDonnell Douglas 
MD-83 operated by American Airlines, Inc. struck some trees and then an ILS antenna as 
it landed short of the runway on approach to Bradley International Airport, Windsor 
Locks, CT.  The accident happened at 00:57 EST.  Only one passenger received minor 
injuries.  The other 77 passengers and crew members were uninjured.   The NTSB 
determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the accident. 
The fourth accident occurred on July 31, 1997, when McDonnell Douglas MD-11 
operated by Federal Express, Inc. made a hard landing at Newark International Airport, 
Newark, NJ.  The airplane bounced and made another hard landing.  When the airplane 
came to a stop, a fire broke out and destroyed the airplane.  The accident occurred 01:30 
EDT.  The two flight crewmembers and three company personnel received minor  
injuries.  The NTSB determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the accident. 
The fifth accident occurred on August 13, 2004, when a Convair 580 crashed on 
approach to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Covington, KY.  The 
accident happened at 00:49 EDT.  The accident was the result of fuel starvation because 
the flight crew did follow approved procedures.  The first office received fatal injuries 
while the captain received minor injuries.  The airplane was destroyed by the impact.  
The NTSB determined that pilot error was the probable cause of the accident. 
These five accidents resulted in seven fatalities.  There were also 7 minor injuries 
passengers and crew members, and 77 crew members and a passenger that received 
minor injuries.

Summary of Above Analyses 
Pilot fatigue is a serious problem.  If nothing is done about this problem, we can 
expect about one aviation accident a year (possibly over six accidents) where pilot fatigue 
will be a contributing factor.  Pilot fatigue will be a contributing factor in many accidents 
that could potentially cost billions of dollars.  
During the past 20 years, there have been over 18 aviation accidents caused by 
pilot error where pilot fatigue was a factor.  NTSB has identified five accidents where the 
flight crew started the day in a state of fatigue.  We statistically identified 4.6 accidents 
where the flight crew became fatigued during a long flight-duty period (NTSB cited pilot 
fatigue as a contributing factor in three of those accidents).  We have also statistically 
estimated that some of the 6.2 accidents that occurred between midnight and 6:00 am 
involved pilot fatigue.  Two of these have already been accounted for in the previously 
discussed analyses.  There were also three accidents where the pilot became fatigued due 
to being awake for many hours.  Lastly, there were two accidents were chronic fatigue 
was a contributing factor.   In summary, we project there would be at least 18.8 accidents 
(13 passenger airplane accidents and 5.8 cargo airplane accidents) during the next 20 
years where pilot fatigue would be a contributing factor to the accident.   
Simulation Results 
Simulation is a tool that we can use to study how many future accidents might 
occur and how severe these future accidents might be.  The passenger and crew casualties 
in the simulated accidents will be different from those in the past.  The casualty estimates 
 41 
 
are based on 278 aviation accidents that occurred during the past 20 years because of 
pilot error.  The exact pilot error that will cause these future accidents could be any one 
of the pilot errors that have occurred during the past 20 years, and need not be the same 
as those errors that caused the above 18.8 accidents.  The aircraft in the simulated future 
accidents could also be different from those in the above accidents.   
Lower Estimated Results 
Projected Passenger Airplane Accidents 
From the above analysis, 13 passenger airplane accidents are expected to occur 
every 20 years, or 0.65 accidents a year.  A 5,000 trial simulation analysis was run with a 
mean value of 0.65 to provide a distribution of the possible outcomes over any future 10-
year period.  The median was 6 accidents; the mean was 6.5 accidents; and the range was 
from no accidents to 18 accidents.

Figure 1.Distribution of Possible Future Passenger Airplane Accidents 
     
On the other hand, the distribution of future fatalities is not a normal distribution, 
but is skewed to the right (see figure 2).  For at least 50 percent of the simulation trials 
there were no fatalities during any 10-year period.  This is not surprising, since in over 90 
percent of the accidents used to develop the simulation model, there were no fatalities.   
However, the right tail of this distribution is long and heavy.  There could be as many as 
828 fatalities during a future 10-year period – a catastrophic collision involving two fully 
loaded wide-body airplanes and one other catastrophic accident also involving a fully 
loaded wide-body airplane could produce this number of fatalities.  The mean of the 
simulation distribution of possible future fatalities was 42.  The simulation results suggest 
 43 
 
there is a 30 percent chance there could be 48 or more fatalities during a future 10-year 
period, a 20 percent chance there could be 91 or more fatalities, and a 10 percent chance 
there could be 144 or more fatalities. 
 
Figure 2.  Distribution of Possible Future Fatalities 
 
The distribution of the undiscounted costs of the possible future passenger 
airplane accidents is shown in figure 3.  The distribution of the costs, like the distribution 
for possible future fatalities, is heavily skewed to the right.  The median for the costs is 
$158.9 million, while the mean is $352.5 million.  The minimum cost is zero and the 
maximum cost is $5.080 billion.  There is a 30 percent chance that costs would exceed 
 44 
 
$402 million; there is a 20 percent chance that costs would exceed $661 million; and a 10 
percent chance that costs would exceed $951 million.

Accidents 
 
 
Figure 4 shows the distribution of the present value of the possible future 
accidents.  It is similar to figure 3 though the values are a little lower.  The median value 
is $110.8 million; mean value is $248.5 million; and the maximum value is $3.592 
billion.

Projected Cargo Airplane Accidents 
Based on the accident analysis above, 5.8 cargo airplane accidents are expected to 
occur every 10 years, or 0.29 accidents a year.  A 5,000 trial simulation analysis using a 
Poisson distribution with a mean value of 0.29 was run to provide a distribution of the 
possible outcomes over any future 10-year period.  In this case, the distribution of 
possible future number of passenger airplane accidents during any 10-year period (see 
 46 
 
figure 5) had almost a normal distribution, though slightly skewed to the right.  The 
median is 3 accidents; the mean was 2.9 accidents; and the range was from no accidents 
to 11 accidents. 
 
Figure 5  Distribution of Possible Future Cargo Airplane Accidents 
 
 
Figure 6 shows the distribution of fatalities for possible future cargo accidents.  
This simulation run projects few fatalities in cargo airplane accidents than for passenger 
airplane accidents.   Over 60 percent of the simulation trials result in no fatalities during 
any 10-year period.  Under 40 percent of the trail result in fatalities.  The mean for this 
 47 
 
distribution is one fatality during a 10-year period. There could be as many as 11 
fatalities during a future 10-year period.  The simulation results suggest there is a 30 
percent chance there could be 2 or more fatalities during a future 10-year period, and a 20 
percent chance there could be 3 or more fatalities. 
 
Figure 6  Distribution of Fatalities from Possible Future Cargo Airplane 
Accidents 
 
 
The undiscounted costs of these simulated future cargo accidents are shown in 
Figure 7.  Since there few casualties, most of the cost will be the result damage to the 
 48 
 
airplane and to the cargo carried.  The distribution of the costs is still skewed to the right.  
The median for the costs is $31.5 million, while the mean is $51.5 million.  The 
minimum cost is zero and the maximum cost is $368.2 million.  There is a 30 percent 
chance that costs would exceed $74 million; there is a 20 percent chance that costs would 
exceed $90 million; and a 10 percent chance that costs would exceed $118 million.

Figure 8 shows the distribution of the present value of the possible future 
accidents.  It is similar to figure 7 though the values are a little lower.  The median value 
is $22.3 million; mean value is $36.1 million; and the maximum value is $258.1 million.

ummary 
If the simulation study is limited to just the number of possible accidents 
identified in the past 20-year period (which would be about 1.0 accidents per year), then 
there would be a mean of 9.4 airplane accidents in a 10-year period.  These accidents 
would result in a mean of 43.1 deaths.  The total estimated benefit from avoiding these 
simulated accidents has a mean value of $404.0 million ($284.6 million, present value).

Upper Estimate Results 
Passenger Airplane Accidents 
The passenger airplane accidents results above are based on the 33 passenger 
accidents where we have enough information in the accident report to make a judgment 
about the presence or absence of pilot fatigue.  Pilot fatigue was present in 13 (or 39.4 
percent) of those accidents.  There are, however, 196 additional pilot error accidents 
involving passenger airplanes where that information is not available.  If the same ratio 
(39.4 percent) of these 196 accidents were in part due to pilot fatigue, then there would be 
an additional 77.2 accidents where pilot fatigue was a contributing factor.  Including the 
additional accidents would mean there could be over 90 passenger airplane accidents 
during the past 20 years where pilot fatigue would be a contributing factor.  If the future 
is like the past, then the expected number of passenger airplane accidents would be 4.51 
per year.  
A 5,000 trial simulation analysis using a Poisson distribution with a mean value of 
4.51 was run to provide a distribution of the possible outcomes of passenger airplane 
accidents over any future 10-year period.  The distribution of possible future number of 
passenger airplane accidents during any 10-year period has almost a normal distribution.  
The mean is 45.15 accidents; and the standard deviation is 6.71 accidents.  The range was 
from 22 accidents to 70 accidents. 
Once again, the distribution of future fatalities is not a normal distribution, but is 
skewed to the right.  This time, there are almost always some fatalities in each the 
 51 
 
simulation trial.  There could be as many as 1,357 fatalities during a future 10-year 
period.  The mean of the simulation distribution of possible future fatalities was 298.  The 
simulation results suggest there is a 30 percent chance there could be 375 or more 
fatalities during a future 10-year period, a 20 percent chance there could be 448 or more 
fatalities, and a 10 percent chance there could be 551 or more fatalities. 
The distribution of the undiscounted costs of the possible future passenger 
airplane accidents has a lognormal distribution (see figure 9).  The median for the costs is 
$2.324 billion, while the mean is $2.483 billion.  The minimum cost is $254.2 million 
and the maximum cost is $8.824 billion.  There is a 30 percent chance that costs would 
exceed $2.957 billion; there is a 20 percent chance that costs would exceed $3.410 
billion; and there is a 10 percent chance that costs would exceed $4.057 billion.

Figure 9  Distribution of Undiscounted Benefits of Avoiding Possible Future 
Passenger Airplane Accidents 
 
 
The distribution of the present value of the cost of the possible future accidents 
has a lognormal shape similar to that for undiscounted costs.  However, the costs 
projections are a little lower.  The mean value is $1.746 billion; and the maximum value 
is $6.839 billion.  There is a 30 percent chance that costs would exceed $2.085 billion; 
there is a 20 percent chance that costs would exceed $2.406 billion; and a 10 percent 
chance that costs would exceed $2.875 billion.  
 
 53 
 
Projected Cargo Airplane Accidents 
The cargo airplane accidents results above are based on the 10 cargo airplane 
accidents where we have enough information in the accident report to make a judgment 
about the presence or absence of pilot fatigue.  Pilot fatigue was present in 5.8 (or 58.0 
percent) of those accidents.  There are, however, 39 additional pilot error accidents 
involving passenger airplanes where that information is not available.  If the same ratio 
(58.0 percent) of these 39 accidents were in part due to pilot fatigue, then there would be 
an additional 22.6 accidents where pilot fatigue was a contributing factor.  Including the 
additional accidents would mean there could be over 28 cargo airplane accidents during 
the past 20 years where pilot fatigue would be a contributing factor.  If the future is like 
the past, then the expected number of cargo airplane accidents would be 1.42 per year 
 A 5,000 trial simulation analysis using a Poisson distribution with a mean value 
of 1.42 was run to provide a distribution of the possible outcomes over any future 10-year 
period.  The distribution of possible future number of cargo airplane accidents during any 
10-year period had almost a normal distribution.  The mean was 14.22 accidents; and the 
standard deviation is 3.83 accidents.  The range is from three accidents to 31 accidents. 
This simulation run projects more fatalities in cargo airplane accidents than was 
the previous case for cargo airplane accidents.   This time over 80 percent of the trails 
resulted in fatalities.  The mean for this distribution is 4.8 fatalities during a 10-year 
period.  There could possibly be as many as 22 fatalities during a future 10-year period.  
The simulation results suggest there is a 30 percent chance there could be 6 or more 
 54 
 
fatalities during a future 10-year period, a 20 percent chance there could be 8 or more 
fatalities, and a 10 percent chance there could be 10 fatalities. 
The distribution of undiscounted costs of these simulated future cargo accidents 
has a lognormal shape.  Once again, most of the cost will be the result damage to the 
airplane and to the cargo carried due to the low number of casualties in cargo airplane 
accidents.  The mean is $251.8 million.  The minimum cost is $12.4 million and the 
maximum cost is $752.2 million.  There is a 30 percent chance that costs would exceed 
$299 million; there is a 20 percent chance that costs would exceed $339 million; and a 10 
percent chance that costs would exceed $398 million. 
The distribution of the present value of the costs of the possible future accidents is 
similar to that for undiscounted costs, but the values are a little lower.  The mean value is 
$176.6 million; and the maximum value is $533.4 million. 
Summary 
When the simulation study is expanded to include all the additional accidents, the 
expected number of accidents would be 59.4 airplane accidents in a ten-year period.  
These accidents would result in a mean of 303 deaths.  The total estimated benefit from 
avoiding these simulated accidents has a mean value of $2.735 billion ($1.923 billion, 
present value).

Best Estimate 
The annual number of pilot fatigue related passenger airplane accidents is 
probably somewhere between 0.65 and 4.51, and the annual number of pilot related cargo 
airplane accidents is between 0.29 and 1.42.  These ranges in the number of these types 
of accidents can also be addressed using simulation analysis. 
Passenger Airplane Accidents 
A 5,000 trial simulation analysis using a Poisson distribution with a mean ranging  
between 0.65 and 4.51 was run to provide a distribution of the possible outcomes of 
passenger airplane accidents over any future 10-year period (see figure 10).  The mean is 
25.96 accidents; and the standard deviation is 12.15 accidents.  The range is between 1 
and 66 accidents.

Figure 10  Distribution of Possible Future Passenger Airplane Accidents  
 
 
The distribution of future fatalities is shown in figure 11.  There is over an 80 
percent chance there will be some fatalities during any given future 10-year period.  
There could possibly be as many as 1,081 fatalities during a future 10-year period.  The 
mean of the simulation distribution of possible future fatalities was 172.  The simulation 
results suggest there is a 30 percent chance there could be 228 or more fatalities during a 
future 10-year period, a 20 percent chance there could be 289 or more fatalities, and a 10 
percent chance there could be 386 or more fatalities.

passenger airplane accidents over any future 10-year period (see figure 14).  The mean is 
8.47 accidents; and the standard deviation is 4.34 accidents.  The range is between no

Summary 
When a range in the number of annual accidents is allowed in the simulation 
analysis, the mean is 28.9 airplane accidents in a ten-year period. These accidents would 
result in a mean of 174.7 deaths.  The estimated cost of these accidents would be a mean 
value of $1.581 billion ($1.121 billion, present value). These numbers represent an 
 65 
 
estimate of the likely number of future accidents, deaths, and costs from future accidents 
with fatigue as a factor. 
 
Effectiveness Analysis 
The above analysis establishes an estimate of the number and range of fatigue 
related accidents if no action is taken to address the problem.  It is seldom the case that a 
rule is 100 percent effective at addressing an identified problem. In particular, fatigue is 
rarely a primary or sole cause of an accident, and therefore this rule, if adopted, is not 
likely to prevent all future accidents that include fatigue as a factor. 
FAA reviewed all NTSB accident reports on Part 121 accidents that occurred 
from 1990 through 2009 to assess the likely capacity of the NPRM to have averted those 
accidents.  The dataset also included some Part 135 accidents prior to spring 1997 that 
occurred on flights which would have been subject to part 121 after spring 1997 under 
the Commuter Rule of that time.  Most reports on major accidents (hull losses or non-hull 
losses that resulted in multiple fatalities) provided extensive data on flight crews’ duty 
tours and recent rest periods, which facilitated relatively strong assessments. 
The FAA’s Office of Accident Investigation and Prevention (AVP) rated each 
accident by conducting a scoring process similar to that conducted by  the Commercial 
Aviation Safety Team (CAST), a well-documented and well understood procedure.  All 
the accidents that have had final National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports 
 66 
 
published have been scored against the CAST safety enhancements.  AVP used the 
NTSB recommendations along with narratives, probable cause, contributing factors and 
other pertinent data to score the accidents.   
When these accidents were not well defined in the probable cause or contributing 
factors statements of the NTSB reports, AVP used a Joint Implementation Monitoring 
Data Analysis Team (JIMDAT)-like method.    The JIMDAT-type scoring system is from 
0 to 5, and the score is based on the likelihood that a proposed action would have 
mitigated that accident.  The level and percentage of effectiveness criteria follows: 
5- 90% effectiveness.  The proposed requirement directly addresses the 
NTSB causal factors and would very likely prevent the accident in the future. 
4- 75% effectiveness.  The proposed requirement directly addresses the 
majority of the NTSB causal factors and would probably prevent or is likely to reduce the 
risk of the respective accident, given the circumstances that prevailed. 
3- 50 % effectiveness.  The proposed requirement directly addresses one of 
several NTSB causal factors and is likely to reduce the risk of the respective accident, 
given the circumstances that prevailed.    
2- 35% effectiveness.  The proposed requirement generally addresses the 
NTSB causal factors and is likely reduce the risk of the respective accident, given the 
circumstances that prevailed.    
 67 
 
1- 15% effectiveness.  The proposed requirement is likely to have reduced 
the risk of the respective accident, given the circumstances that prevailed. 
0- 0% effectiveness.  The proposed requirement would not reduce the risk of 
this type of accident in the future. 
AVP applied the above methodology to the details of each such pilot fatigue 
accident to reach a qualitative assessment of the NPRM’s potential capacity to avoid each 
pilot fatigue accident.  The qualitative assessments ranged from zero (0) to low (1), 
moderate (3), high (4) and very high (5).  The qualitative assessments then were 
converted to quantitative effectiveness scores as follows: zero; 15%; 35%; 50%; 75%; 
and 90%. The effectiveness scores yielded about 8 accidents avoided over 20 years (see 
Technical Report submitted to the docket for the scoring results of the above accidents 
used in this analysis).  According to this scoring, the proposed rule would be 40 percent 
effective at preventing passenger airplane accidents where pilot fatigue was a 
contributing factor and would be 58 percent effective at preventing cargo airplane 
accidents where pilot fatigue was a contributing factor. 
Accordingly, the above estimate of the benefits of avoiding passenger airplane 
accidents where pilot fatigue was a causal factor have been reduced to 40 percent of their 
above stated values.  The undiscounted mean benefit was reduced from $1.403 billion to 
$572.1 million and the maximum undiscounted benefit was reduced from $7.225 billion 
to $2.890 billion.  The mean present value of the benefit was reduced from $1.006 billion 
 68 
 
to $402.5 million and the maximum present value benefit was reduced from $5.322 
billion to $2.129 billion. 
Next, the estimated benefits of avoiding cargo airplane accidents were reduced to 
58 percent of their above stated values.  The undiscounted mean benefit was reduced 
from $150.5 million to $87.3 million and the maximum undiscounted benefit was 
reduced from $614.8 billion to $356.6 million.  The mean present value of the benefit 
was reduced from $105.7 million to $61.3 million and the maximum present value 
benefit was reduced from $446.2 million to $258.8 million.   
 The estimated benefit of avoiding passenger and cargo airplane accidents would 
be a mean value of $659.4 million ($463.8 million, present value). 
Additional Benefits 
 
 
The FAA has investigated other areas of potential benefit from this proposed rule. 
These areas are not quantified at this time, but are additional factors that should be 
considered when deciding whether to proceed with this rule. 
The first area is in the area of minor aircraft and equipment damage on the ramp. 
By necessity, the focus on fatal accidents examines extremely remote events where 
something in the events leading to the accident did not reliably provide the necessary 
safety margin or back up. In part the focus on fatal accidents comes from the fact they are 
investigated in detail, event chains and causes are well defined, and assumptions can be 
 69 
 
made about cause and effect. However, there is a much larger universe of relatively 
minor accidents that may involve much larger annual dollar losses than the few fatal 
accidents that do occur. However, so few of these are investigated in much detail that 
they tend to be disregarded when looking at new safety regulations. 
In the 170 Part 121 accidents from 2004-2008, there were a total of ten events that 
had a fatality. Overall, 90 fatalities occurred on those ten flights over the course of five 
years. Using a VSL of $6 million, the monetized value of loss of life is $540 million, and 
the average value of lost lives is about $100 million per year. This amount is only a small 
fraction of the overall cost of accidents on airport ramps. One estimate puts the cost of 
ground accidents and incidents which include injuries, fatalities and property damage at 
$5 billion per year worldwide.  In the U.S. alone, total costs of ramp incidents and 
accidents exceed $3 billion per year. However, these events are not investigated in 
detail—i.e., there is a lack of causal information, no human factors report with work 
chronology, etc.  
The fatigue literature suggests that the greatest benefits from fatigue reduction lie 
in increased productivity and in the reduction of human errors. Thus, we would expect to 
see a much larger number of events where pilot fatigue is a cause or factor, than is 
represented by fatal accidents alone. Preliminary research shows that the frequency of 
ground accidents during the evening (6:00 PM to midnight) and early morning (midnight 
to 6:00 AM) is higher than the distributions of scheduled takeoffs and landings would 
suggest. We observe a similar relationship when we look at Aviation Safety Reporting 
System (ASRS) reports citing pilot fatigue and related topics. 
 70 
 
Of course not all the ground accidents involve pilot error, and not all instances of 
pilot error are cause by fatigue. However, the data on when these accidents occur suggest 
they are more prevalent when the potential for fatigue is greatest. In addition, the types of 
events such as taxiing a wing tip into another aircraft or gate, are symptomatic of poor 
decision making, poor spatial judgment, a focus on completing the flight quickly and 
other factors which may be more prevalent when fatigued. If even only a few percent of 
the losses from ground accidents are caused by pilot fatigue, the annual losses are large 
Three percent would be $90 million per year. These data suggest that the scope of 
accidents/incidents for valuing safety needs to be expanded to account for losses due to 
ground events where appropriate. 
The second area is in the value of having well rested (and well-trained) pilots in 
the cockpit to solve minor problems before they become accidents.  The aviation system 
is extremely complex, and aircraft are extremely complex machines.  It is also extremely 
safe. When an accident occurs, it is generally the result of a long chain of multiple 
failures. The flightcrew in the cockpit is generally the last opportunity to break the chain 
and prevent an accident. It is well established that fatigued people are less likely to 
quickly and efficiently diagnose and solve problems than well-rested people. Every day, 
small events and mishaps are dealt with by the cockpit crew and they never become 
accidents, or the outcome is somewhat mitigated by the quick action of the crew.  (The 
Flight 1549 that landed safely in the Hudson River is an example of how very quick 
reaction and decision making can avert catastrophes.) Some small number of incidents 
and accidents caused by things other than fatigue or human error maybe could have been 
 71 
 
prevented or mitigated if the crew had quickly behaved differently.  While we have 
documented the likely size of the accident problem with fatigue as a factor, it is not 
possible to estimate the impact of increased problem solving capability from fewer 
fatigued pilots.  It is, however, real and significant. 
 
Sensitivity Analysis:  Value of Statistical Life Estimates  
for FAA Regulatory Programs 
 
Complex analyses for difficult public policy decisions typically employ 
sensitivity analyses to allow decision makers to see the impact of different values of key 
variables, to see how those different values impact the results of the analysis.  The value 
of a statistical life (VSL) is an important policy measure as it is primarily used when 
federal agencies look to compare the costs and benefits of potential investment and 
regulatory policies and programs.   In this regulatory impact analysis, FAA presented 
total benefits based on VSLs of $6 million, as suggested by 2009 guidance from DOT, 
and consistent with OMB Circular A-4.   If $8.4 million were used for VSL, the 
undiscounted benefits would be $837 million and the present value of those benefits 
would be $589 million.  A VSL value of $8.4 million is consistent with recent 
literature
1415
. The FAA requests public comment on whether decision-makers should

COST ANALYSIS 
Cost Overview 
The total estimated cost of the proposed rule is $1.25 billion ($804 million present 
value using a seven percent discount rate) for the ten year period from 2013 to 2022.   
The FAA classified costs into four main components and estimated the costs for each 
component.
16
  We obtained data from various industry sources; the sources of the data 
used in cost estimation are explained in each section.  We were very fortunate that several 
carriers ran two alternatives to the proposed rule through their crew scheduling programs.  
Their estimates provided some comparison data to calibrate and validate our costing 
approach.  Without their help, we would have likely missed some cost elements.  The 
Cost Summary Table below identifies the four main cost components.  Flight operations 
cost makes up about 60 percent of the total cost of the rule.  Each of the main cost 
components are explained in-depth in the following sections of this document.  
Cost Summary 
  Cost Area Nominal Cost Present Value Cost 
      (in $ millions) (in $millions) 
Flight Operations    $760.3  $484.2 
Scheduling Reliability  $4.9  $3.0 
Fatigue Training Costs  $262.3  $167.2 
Cost of Rest Facilities  $226.6  $149.1 
Total Cost     $1,254.1   $803.5 
 
                                                          
16
 The FAA also calculated alternative scheduling costs, which comprise the largest cost component of the 
proposed rule.  Discussions of these alternatives follow the main cost section. 
 
 74 
 
In addition to the costs presented in the Cost Summary Table, there may be costs 
of a fatigue risk management system (FRMS).  The FAA is not imposing an FRMS 
program requirement on Part 121 carriers, but is allowing them the option of developing 
and implementing such a program.  Operators might do this for ultralong flights, which 
have flight time over 16 hours. Operators might develop an FRMS program as an 
alternative to the flight and duty period rules proposed by this rulemaking when the crew 
scheduling cost savings equal or exceed the costs of the FRMS program.  The FAA 
estimates that an FRMS program would cost between $0.8 and $10.0 million for each 
operator over ten years.  The FAA believes that about 35 operators have at least partially 
adopted an FRMS program at this time.  The FAA estimates the total cost would be 
$205.7 million ($144.9 million present value), which would be more than offset by a 
reduction in crew scheduling costs.  Accordingly, the cost is not added to the total costs 
imposed by this rule.  The FAA calls for comment on this aspect of the proposal as it has 
not assigned a cost to the cumulative maximums.
17
  
Flight Operations – Overview 
 The flight operations cost component of the proposed rule is composed of five 
sub-components: crew scheduling costs, cost to supplement the flight engineer on 
augmented operations, crew management system computer programming costs, cost 
savings of reduced reserves, and cost savings of the elimination of the flight time limit for 
                                                          
17
 Cumulative maximums are limitations on the amount of duty or flight time that flightcrew members are 
allowed to work over a period of time greater than a single duty period; for instance, the proposed rule 
sets a maximum of 65 duty hours in any seven-day period and a maximum of 200 duty hours in a 28-day 
period. 
 75 
 
augmented operations.  Table 5 provides a summary of the five sub-components of the 
flight operations cost.  Each of the sub-components is explained in-depth in the following 
sections of the document.

Flight Operations – Crew Scheduling 
Analysis of Crew Schedule Data 
Six air carriers
18
 provided actual crew schedule data to the FAA to assist in the 
cost analysis of the Flightcrew Member Duty and Rest Requirements Rulemaking.  The 
data consisted of one spring month in 2009 and one summer month in 2009 of actual 
work history for each flightcrew member employed by each carrier.  The specific months 
varied by carrier.  The data included all duty time and flight time worked by each 
flightcrew member, and included both lineholder and reserve pilots. 
                                                          
18
 Two of the carriers included data for related carriers operating under multiple business names. 
 76 
 
The individual flightcrew member work histories were used to construct baseline 
summary data for each carrier.  The total numbers of duty periods, duty hours, flight 
hours, and flight segments were summarized.  The summary data were divided by the 
number of flightcrew members in each dataset to produce the average number of duty 
periods, duty hours, flight hours, and flight segments per flightcrew member per month.  
The baseline data was later used to estimate the number of noncompliant hours under the 
proposed rule. 
Three types of crew scheduling limits were examined: flight duty, rest, and flight 
time limits.  Only limits relating to individual flight duty periods were applied.  
Cumulative limits were not applied due to data limitations..  Flight duty limits impose a 
maximum number of hours that a flightcrew member may be on flight duty, based on the 
number of flight segments flown during the flight duty period (for unaugmented 
operations only), the starting time of the flight duty period, and, for augmented operations 
only, the rest facility onboard the aircraft and the number of crew operating the flight.  
Rest limits require that a flightcrew member have received a minimum number of rest 
hours (hours free from all duty) prior to beginning a flight duty period and vary 
depending on geographic location (domestic or international flights).
19
  Flight limits 
impose a maximum number of hours that a flightcrew member may operate an aircraft 
during a given flight duty period and vary depending on the starting time of the flight 
duty period (for unaugmented operations only).  
                                                          
19
 In the context of proposed minimum rest limits, “domestic” refers to a flight duty period beginning in 
the 48 contiguous states, territories, and District of Colombia.  “International” refers to a flight duty 
period beginning outside of the 48 contiguous states, territories, and District of Colombia. 
 77 
 
A computer program was used to apply flight duty, rest, and flight time limits to 
the actual crew schedule data.  First, the maximum flight duty limits were applied to each 
individual duty period.  If the flight duty period exceeded the relevant flight duty limit, 
the duty period was truncated at the limit.  Next, the minimum rest limits were applied to 
each individual duty period.  If a flight duty period was not preceded by the relevant 
minimum number of rest hours, then the preceding flight duty period was truncated at the 
point where the minimum number of rest hours was sufficient for the flight duty period in 
question.  Finally, the flight limits were applied to each individual flight duty period.  If 
the sum of all flight time within a flight duty period exceeded the relevant flight limit, the 
last flight segment of the flight duty period was eliminated from the data, with the 
elimination of flight segments continuing backwards, if necessary, until the sum of all 
flight time within the flight duty period was lower than the flight limit.  For all of the 
types of limits, if the flight duty period was truncated while a flight segment was 
underway, then the entire flight segment was eliminated from the data. 
The application of the proposed flight duty, rest, and flight time limits resulted in 
modified flightcrew member work histories.  These modified work histories were used to 
construct modified summary data for each carrier, similar to the baseline summary data.  
The modified number of duty periods, duty hours, flight hours, and flight segments also 
were summarized.  The modified summary data was divided by the number of flightcrew 
members in each dataset to produce the average number of duty periods, duty hours, 
flight hours, and flight segments per flightcrew member per month. 
 78 
 
The modified average number of flight hours per flightcrew member was 
compared to the baseline average number of flight hours per flightcrew member for each 
carrier.  The difference between the two numbers represented the average number of 
flight hours per flightcrew member that were not compliant with the applied flight duty, 
rest, and flight time rules.  The assumption is that these extra hours result in needing to 
either hire new pilots or pay existing pilots for more hours of duty. This is a very 
conservative initial estimate, which is later adjusted. 
The FAA evaluated the proposed flight duty, rest, and flight time limits to 
produce an estimated crew scheduling cost for the entire air transport industry.  Table 6 
details the most significant differences between the proposed rule and current Part 121 
rules.

were assigned to a comparison group for purposes of cost estimation.  The comparison 
group is the industry group that most closely resembles the unrepresented industry group.

To determine the crew scheduling costs of the proposed rule, the number of 
noncompliant flight hours for each air carrier in the air transport industry was first 
calculated.  The number of noncompliant flight hours for each carrier was calculated by 
multiplying the number of flightcrew members employed by the carrier by the average 
number of noncompliant flight hours per flightcrew member for the carrier’s relevant 
comparison group.  Table 10 presents the number of noncompliant flight hours and their 
share relative to the baseline for the proposed rule. 
Table 10: Noncompliant Flight Hours 
Noncompliant Flight Hours Share of Baseline

After the total number of noncompliant flight hours was calculated for each 
carrier, costs were calculated based on the average hourly salary for each flightcrew 
 82 
 
member, for each carrier.  The primary source of salary data was a 2006 report by AIR, 
Inc, an aviation industry publication.  The report listed both annual salary and estimated 
credit hours for many carriers.  This information was used to estimate the average hourly 
salary per flightcrew member.  If salary data were unavailable for a carrier, the average 
hourly salary per flightcrew member for that carrier’s industry group was used as a 
proxy.  The average hourly salaries were updated to 2009 values using the Air Transport 
Association (ATA) Passenger Airline Cost Index.  The labor component of the cost index 
was used to update the salaries from Q3 2006 to Q3 2009.

average hourly salary per flightcrew member for each industry group.

The average hourly salary per flightcrew member for each carrier was multiplied 
by the noncompliant flight hours for each carrier, resulting in an estimated salary cost for 
each carrier.  After estimating the additional crew scheduling salary cost, it was necessary

to calculate the additional hotel and per-diem costs that would be incurred by carriers.  
During the rulemaking, one carrier had estimated its expected crew scheduling costs 
resulting from the flight duty, rest, and flight limits of one alternative to the proposed 
rule.  As part of this analysis, the carrier allocated its total crew scheduling costs to 
salary, hotel, and per diem categories.  We have used their costs proportions to estimate 
hotel and per diem for other scenarios. 
The individual carrier salary, hotel, and per-diem costs were summarized based 
on the seven industry groups to result in unadjusted additional annual crew scheduling 
costs resulting from the application of NPRM flight duty, rest, and flight time limits, as 
shown in Table 12.

  The FAA believes that substantial opportunity for re-optimization exists because 
many of the flight segments that are eliminated for non-compliance with the proposed 
rule are only non-compliant by small amounts of time.  Approximately 86 percent of the 
eliminated flights are due to non-compliance with duty limits, rather than flight or rest 
limits.  The FAA examined the amount of time by which the duty period associated with 
each eliminated flight segment exceeded the maximum allowable duty time.  Chart 1 
presents these results.  Nearly 40 percent of flights were eliminated due to their duty 
period exceeding the maximum allowable duty time by less than 60 minutes.

The FAA believes the crew scheduling costs calculated using this methodology 
substantially overestimate the probable actual cost impact of the proposed rule.  Most 
 85 
 
airlines employ computer programs to optimize crew schedules – to minimize the number 
of crew hours, and hotel and per diem costs it takes to fly a given flight schedule within 
imposed constraints.  The FAA accordingly has developed a methodology to adjust the 
estimate based on total non-compliant hours to a more realistic representation of costs 
after re-optimization.  We ask for comments on the cost adjustments described in the next 
section and request a detailed explanation or justification for any and all comments. 
Crew Scheduling Cost Adjustments 
To approximate the reductions in cost that will occur when airlines optimize crew 
schedules following implementation of the rule, the FAA made several adjustments to the 
crew scheduling costs presented in Table 12.  These adjustments include both short-term 
and long-term optimization that the FAA believes is likely to occur. 
The FAA applied a short-term optimization factor of 25 percent to the unadjusted 
costs.  This discount off of raw costs approximates the savings expected from the 
computer models used to build schedules; flight schedules will be rearranged into new 
trips that meet the new constraints of the rule. Typically, industry will experience from 10 
percent to 40 percent savings from reoptimizing in this fashion. FAA selected a factor of 
25 percent because it approximates the difference in costs submitted by a sample of 
carriers to FAA when they evaluated an alternative to the proposed rule, using their 
computer models, to the costs estimated by the FAA using the same cost estimation 
process described previously.   Table 13 presents the annual costs after short-term 
optimization.

 After determining the crew scheduling costs after short-term optimization, FAA 
examined the salary component of the crew scheduling costs and identified the share that 
would be additional pay to existing crews versus salary for new hires.  The initial shares 
are identical to those provided by one carrier that submitted a detailed cost estimate to 
FAA of an alternative to the proposed rule.  Over time, FAA believes that the share of 
pay to existing crews will increase while the share of new hire salary will decrease, 
because carriers will continue to schedule crews ever more efficiently.  Table 14 provides 
the annual shares of the crew scheduling cost components.

2022 59% 30% 11%
 
 Once the share of salary costs between the existing crews and new hires was 
determined, FAA identified additional long-term optimization factors, independent of the 
previously described short-term optimization.  The long-term optimization factors reflect 
 88 
 
changes to crew bases, flight schedules, and other similar changes that will be 
implemented over a number of years. These also include potential adjustments to 
contracts between pilots and airlines that govern pay and working conditions. In 
conjunction with this step, FAA identified costs as either transfer costs or resource costs. 
The sum of these represents the financial impact on the carrier.  
Transfer costs are defined as temporary cost increases resulting from short-term 
disruptions for the industry and its participants.  These result in financial transfers 
between the carriers and flightcrew members.  Resource costs are defined as true costs to 
society, due to inefficient use of resources. (The key difference between resource costs 
and transfers is whether the pilot ends up with free time that can be put to other 
productive uses.  If a pilot does end up with additional free time for the same pay as 
before, this represents a transfer between the carrier and the pilot.)  Tables 15 and 16 
identify the long-term optimization factors, transfer costs, and resource costs for existing 
crews and new hires, respectively.  Over the longer term, we expect that carriers will be 
able to improve scheduling efficiency of existing crew members.  In the case of new 
pilots, there is less of an opportunity to improve scheduling efficiency.

Flight Operations – Additional Pilot to Supplement Flight Engineer 
Carriers currently operating flights in excess of eight hours with a flightcrew of 
two pilots and one flight engineer will incur additional pilot salary costs on these flights 
under the proposed rule.  Under current Part 121 rules, flight engineers are considered to 
be a crewmember for purposes of determining whether a flight can operate under 
 91 
 
augmented flight and duty rules.  The proposed rule will not allow flight engineers to be 
considered as crewmembers when determining whether a flight can operate under 
augmented flight and duty rules.  Therefore, carriers will need to add another pilot to the 
flightcrew for those flights that currently exceed eight hours and have a flightcrew of two 
pilots and a flight engineer. 
The first step to estimating the cost impact of this aspect of the proposed rule was 
to examine the crew schedule data provided to the FAA and identify the flights affected 
by this rule change.  Flights exceeding eight hours with a two pilot flightcrew were 
identified.  Only those flights on aircraft types that utilize a flight engineer were 
considered.  The only flights that met these criteria were operated by carriers in the large 
cargo group.  The number of flight hours associated with these flights was then 
annualized.  The annual number of flight hours was divided by the number of flight 
engineers for the relevant carriers to produce an average number of flight hours affected 
by the rule change per flight engineer.  The result is 29.1 flight hours per flight engineer 
per year.  The only aircraft types operated by flight engineers in the sample data that 
FAA received from the carriers are Boeing 727 and Boeing 747 aircraft. 
The average number of flight hours affected per flight engineer was extrapolated 
to the entire air transport industry using the number of flight engineers listed on each air 
carrier’s operating certificate in OPSS.  The average number of flight hours affected per 
flight engineer was multiplied by the number of flight engineers at each carrier.  The 
result represents the total number of flight hours that must be flown by a pilot to comply 
with the proposed rule.  The total number of flight hours for each carrier was multiplied 
 92 
 
by the average hourly pilot salary for the carrier’s industry group to obtain a total 
estimated cost of this aspect of the proposed rule.  Table 18 summarizes the results by 
industry group.  Industry groups that did not include a carrier with at least one flight 
engineer were excluded from Table 18.

Flight Operations – Computer Programming 
 Carriers will incur computer programming costs as they will need to update their 
crew management systems and their schedule optimization systems with the constraints 
imposed by the proposed rule.  This will be a one-time cost incurred in 2013 as carriers 
update their computer systems.  Computer programming costs were estimated for each 
individual carrier, based on the number of flightcrew members listed on the carrier’s 
operating certificate.   
Carriers were assigned to one of three groups based on the number of flightcrew 
members.  Costs were estimated based on the number of person-days required to 
complete the computer programming and a daily professional staff cost of $2,500.  Table 
20 presents the nominal and present value computer programming costs.  We invite 
 94 
 
specific comment on this estimate of the expected computer programming costs for 
carriers.

Flight Operations – Cost Savings from Reduced Reserves 
 The proposed rule is designed to reduce the risk of fatigued flightcrew members 
by limiting the maximum number of hours they are permitted to be on duty, the number 
of hours they actually fly during duty periods, and by ensuring that they receive adequate 
rest periods before reporting for duty.  It is expected that the proposed rule will result in 
better-rested flightcrew members.  The proposed rule will reduce flight crew member 
fatigue, thus reducing the use of sick time.  When a flightcrew member is scheduled for 
duty and calls in sick or fatigued, the airline must use a reserve flightcrew member to 
complete the scheduled duty.  The proposed rule will reduce the use of reserve flightcrew 
members to cover fatigue-induced sick call-ins by flight crew members, which will 
reduce the flight operations cost associated with fatigue issues for carriers. 
 95 
 
While the precise share of current sick time attributable to fatigue is unknown, it 
is most likely greater than zero.  Similarly, while the precise amount by which the 
proposed rule will reduce sick time is unknown, it is also most likely greater than zero.  
For the purposes of this analysis, FAA assumes that sick time accounts for five percent of 
total industry flightcrew member pay.  The proposed rule is expected to reduce the use of 
sick time by five percent.  The nominal value of the cost savings is $231.7 million 
($142.1 million present value) over the ten-year period of analysis.  Table 21 presents the 
annual cost savings.

Flight Operations – Cost Savings from Augmented Operations 
The proposed rule eliminates the existing maximum flight time limit for 
augmented operations, which creates a potential cost-saving opportunity for carriers.  
Carriers are required to operate some flights with four flightcrew members under existing 
maximum flight time limits.  Some of these flights could be operated with three 
flightcrew members under the proposed rule, which would reduce carriers’ flight 
operations costs. 
The existing maximum flight time limit for flag and supplemental carriers is 12 
hours for three flightcrew members and 16 hours for four flightcrew members.  Although 
there are no maximum flight time limits in the proposed rule for augmented operations, 
flightcrew members’ flight time will be limited in practice by maximum flight duty time 
limits.  The proposed rule sets the maximum flight duty time for a flightcrew member 
when operating a flight with three flightcrew members at 16 hours for flights on an 
aircraft with a Class 1 rest facility and when the flight duty period begins between 0700-
1259.  This maximum flight duty time limit is lower if the aircraft has a lesser-quality rest 
facility and/or if the flight duty period begins at an earlier or later time. 
To determine the potential cost savings resulting from the elimination of 
augmented maximum flight time limits, the FAA analyzed actual flightcrew member 
schedule data from six carriers.  The data included complete duty and flight records for 
every flightcrew member (lineholder and reserve) for one spring month and one summer 
 97 
 
month in 2009.  Due to the limited sample size, the FAA needed to make several 
assumptions and the resulting potential cost estimate is highly uncertain. 
First, only flights conducted with four crewmembers with a flight duration of 12 
to 14 hours were considered for potential cost savings.  Flights of less than 12 hours were 
not considered because flag and supplemental carriers are allowed to operate flights of 
less than 12 hours with three flightcrew members under existing maximum flight time 
limits.  Flights of more than 14 hours were not considered because the maximum flight 
duty time for a flightcrew member under the proposed rule is 16 hours when operating a 
flight augmented with one additional flightcrew member.  The two hour difference is 
accounted for by check in preceding the flight and check out time following the flight.  
To the extent that actual check in/check out is greater than or less than the assumed two 
hours, this potential cost savings estimate may overestimate or underestimate the actual 
cost savings. 
Second, it is assumed that flightcrew member labor agreements will permit the 
carriers to reduce the number of flightcrew members from four to three.  To the extent 
that labor agreements restrict the flexibility of carriers to reduce the number of flightcrew 
members on these flights, this potential cost savings estimate will overestimate the actual 
cost savings. 
Third, it is assumed that the crew scheduling needs of carriers will permit them to 
reduce the number of flightcrew members from four to three.  To the extent that carriers 
desire to operate a flight with four flightcrew members rather than three flightcrew 
 98 
 
members for operational or schedule reliability purposes, this potential cost savings 
estimate will overestimate the actual cost savings. 
Fourth, to extrapolate the potential cost savings of those carriers for which FAA 
had data to the entire US air transport industry, it was necessary to assume that the 
scheduling practices of other carriers were similar to the scheduling practices of those 
carriers for which FAA had data.  If the scheduling practices of the remainder of the US 
air transport industry materially differ from the scheduling practices of those carriers for 
which FAA had data, this estimate of potential cost savings may over- or understate the 
actual cost savings. 
To estimate the potential cost savings of those carriers for which FAA had data, 
flight segments of 12 to 14 hours operated by four flightcrew members were identified.  
Four carriers operated flights that met these criteria.  The carriers represented the 
commercial passenger and large cargo industry groups.  For the flights that met the 
criteria, the following data was collected: flight hours, flight duty period start hour, and 
aircraft rest facility. 
A distribution of flight hours by flight duty period start hour and aircraft rest 
facility was calculated.  The share of flight hours for which the maximum flight duty 
period limit applied (16 hours) was used to adjust the number of flight hours.  This 
adjusted number of flight hours represented a realistic number of flight hours that could 
be reduced from four flightcrew members to three flightcrew members based on 
 99 
 
maximum flight duty period constraints.  Table 22 displays the distribution of flight hours 
that was used to make the flight hours adjustment.

Next, the number of adjusted flight hours per flightcrew member was calculated.  
This was accomplished by dividing the total flightcrew members by the adjusted flight 
hours.  This figure was then annualized.  Table 23 presents the annual adjusted flight 
hours saved per flightcrew member.

The estimate of adjusted flight hours saved per flightcrew member was 
extrapolated to a subset of the entire US air transport industry.  The subset consisted of 
those passenger carriers that had at least one flight segment exceeding eight hours in the 
year ended June 2009.
22
  The subset also included all carriers in the large cargo and 
charter passenger industry groups. 
While aggregated results are reported in this section, the cost savings estimate 
was conducted on a carrier-specific basis.  The adjusted number of flight hours saved per 
flightcrew member was multiplied by the total number of flightcrew members for each 
carrier.
23
  The total adjusted flight hours saved per flightcrew member was multiplied by 
the average hourly salary for that carrier to result in an estimated cost savings.  Table 24 
presents the results of the potential cost savings by industry group.

Flight Operations – Total Cost 
The total flight operations cost is composed of the additional crew scheduling 
costs (flightcrew member salary, hotel, and per diem), plus the cost of supplementing a 
two-pilot and flight engineer flightcrew with an additional pilot for flights greater than 
eight hours, plus the computer programming costs, less the cost savings from reduced 
reserves, and less the cost savings resulting from the elimination of maximum flight time 
limits for augmented operations.  The net nominal value of the total flight operations cost 
for the period of analysis is $760.3 million, with a present value of $484.2 million. Table 
26 presents the annual nominal and present value total flight operations cost.  Table 27 
provides breakdown of the total flight operations cost by cost sub-component.  The FAA 
 103 
 
asks for comments regarding the flight operations cost, accompanied by a detailed 
justification.

Schedule Reliability  
Schedule reliability refers to the accuracy of the scheduled flight duty period 
compared to the actual flight duty period.  Carriers will be required to report the 
scheduling reliability and pairing-specific reliability to the FAA every two months.
24
  The 
FAA expects carriers to use existing software packages, but carriers will need to 
incorporate and write new reports, which will warn of potential compliance issues with 
the proposed rule.  The FAA is aware of at least two smaller operators who run schedule 
reliability programs manually without the support of software. For operators who perform 
the analysis manually, there would be no software investment required.  
Although the reporting requirements would exist for all carriers, the only carriers 
who would incur any significant cost would be the ones who do not schedule reliably, 
that is, those having existing unrealistic scheduled vs. actual times.  These carriers would 
have to publish more realistic crew schedules and might have to make some scheduling 
adjustments.  The FAA believes that most carriers are already publishing realistic 
schedules overall and there would be a minimal impact on these carriers to publish and 
adjust an existing schedule. 
The FAA estimates that each carrier would take about two days to modify their 
scheduling software to create the required report.  We assume that the carriers will use 
the equivalent of a GS-14, step 5 employee to do this work.  With a fully loaded hourly 
cost of $68.86 and roughly 98 operators, the industry cost would be roughly $108,000 
                                                          
24
 The report format would be either .xls or .xml. 
 105 
 
($88,000 present value) in the first year to make the necessary changes to their 
scheduling programs. 
Each operator would take roughly one more day to prepare, troubleshoot, and 
submit the report every two months (six reports per year) to the FAA.  In this case the 
FAA assumes that each operator will use the equivalent of a GS-11, step 5 employee with 
a burdened hourly cost of $33.21.  The annual cost per operator is $1,600.  For the 
industry (98 operators) for the ten-year period of analysis, the total cost is $1.6 million 
($1.0 million present value). 
The FAA believes the burden on it for imposing the reporting requirements would 
be 2.5 FTE’s.  We assume these employees will be at the GS-13, step 5 grade level (at 
Washington DC locality pay rates) at a burdened annual cost of $130,500.  The total 
government cost for the period of analysis is $3.3 million ($2.0 million present value). 
The total estimated cost to implement scheduling reliability reporting is $4.9 
million ($3.0 million present value.)  Annual costs are shown in Table 28.

Fatigue Training - Overview 
The proposed rule amends existing flight, duty, and rest regulations by requiring 
Part 121 operators to develop fatigue training programs.  The intent of the fatigue training 
will be to educate all employees responsible for developing air carrier schedules and 
safety of flight on the symptoms of fatigue, as well as the factors leading to fatigue and 
how to mitigate fatigue-based risk.  The employees that will be required to complete 
fatigue training programs include flightcrew members, dispatchers, and management.  
The fatigue training will be incorporated into existing distance learning programs used by 
carriers.  Table 29 provides a summary of fatigue training costs, which are explained in 
detail in the following sections.

Fatigue Training – Flightcrew Members 
This section describes the approach used to estimate the fatigue training costs for 
flightcrew members (captains, first officers, and flight engineers).  Initial and recurring 
fatigue training costs were calculated for all flightcrew members from 2013 to 2022.  The 
primary cost component is salary compensation for the time that flightcrew members 
spend in fatigue training.  There will be no hotel or per-diem costs because the training 
will be conducted through distance learning programs.   
Flightcrew members’ data were derived from the FAA Operating Specification 
Subsystem (OPSS), which reports the number of flightcrew members as recorded on each 
carrier’s operating certificate.  Table 30 shows the total number of captains, first officers, 
and flight engineers by air carrier group.  The initial fatigue training cost for 2013 is 
based on the cost of training these flightcrew members.

Initial fatigue training is five hours.  Every flightcrew member will be required to 
undergo initial fatigue training in 2013.  In subsequent years, newly qualified flightcrew 
members will be required to undergo initial fatigue training, in addition to previously 
qualified flightcrew members that change employers.  The annual retirement rate for 
flightcrew members is 3.3 percent.  It is assumed that an equivalent number of flightcrew 
members will be qualified to replace those that retire.  The ―churn‖ rate (the share of 
flightcrew members that change employers within a given year) is one percent.  
After undergoing initial fatigue training, each flightcrew member will be required 
to complete two hours of recurring training every year.  This training will also be 
incorporated into existing distance learning programs. 
The total number of flightcrew members for each year from 2013 to 2022 is 
assumed to be equivalent to the total number of flightcrew members holding certificates 
in October 2009, as recorded by OPSS.  Table 31 shows the annual number of flightcrew 
members required to undergo both initial and recurring fatigue training from 2013 to 
2022.

The average hourly salaries of flightcrew members were then determined based 
on carrier-specific annual salary data from AIR, Inc.  The salary data was then converted 
into an average hourly salary.  The average hourly salary was calculated by dividing the 
average annual salary by the minimum guaranteed pay credit hours per month as defined 
in pilot labor agreements.  The average hourly salaries were updated to 2009 values using 
the Air Transport Association (ATA) Passenger Cost Index.  The labor component of the 
cost index was used to update the salaries from Q3 2006 to Q3 2009. 
Flightcrew member fatigue training costs are equal to the number of flightcrew 
member training hours multiplied by the average hourly salary.  Table 32 presents the 
nominal annual costs of fatigue training for flightcrew members.  The total nominal cost 
over the ten-year period is $234.2 million.  Table 33 presents the present value annual 
 110 
 
costs of fatigue training for flightcrew members.  The total present value cost over the 
ten-year period is $149.3 million.

Fatigue Training – Dispatchers and Management 
The proposed rule also requires that dispatchers and upper management having 
operational control over pilots be given fatigue training.  The number of dispatchers in 
the U.S. air transport industry is equal to approximately three percent of the number of 
pilots.  The number of management personnel is estimated to be three times the number 
of dispatchers.  Therefore, the total number of dispatchers and management personnel 
required to receive fatigue training is estimated to be 12 percent of total flightcrew 
members.  The corresponding increase in cost is assumed to be 12 percent.   
The estimated total net present value cost of the proposed fatigue training 
requirements for dispatchers and management personnel over the ten-year period from 
 112 
 
2013 to 2022 is $17.9 million.  Table 34 lists both nominal and present value fatigue 
training annual costs for dispatchers and management.

Rest Facilities – Overview 
 The proposed rule establishes maximum flight duty time limits for augmented 
operations that are dependent on the start time of the flight duty period, the number of 
crew assigned to the flight, and the class of rest facility installed on the aircraft.  There 
are two types of costs associated with the rest facility cost component of the proposed 
rule.  First, there is the cost resulting from the physical installation of the rest facilities in 
the aircraft fleet.  Second, there is the loss of passenger revenue when the use of the rest 
facility removes seats from passenger revenue service.  Table 36 provides an overview of 
the ten-year costs of the rest facility component of the proposed rule. 
 
 114

Cost Area
Nominal Cost
(millions)
PV Cost
(millions)
Installation $ 49.8 $ 40.7
Lost Passenger Revenue $ 176.8 $ 108.5
Total Rest Facilities $ 226.6 $ 149.1
 
 The proposed rule establishes detailed specifications for each of the three classes 
of rest facilities.  Class 1 rest facilities are most conducive to reducing the risk of fatigue 
in augmented operations; accordingly, the maximum flight duty time permitted for 
augmented operations conducted with Class 1 rest facility-equipped  aircraft is greater 
than the maximum flight duty time permitted for augmented operations conducted with 
either Class 2 or 3 rest facility-equipped aircraft.  The definitions of the rest facilities are 
as follows: 
o A Class 1 rest facility is a bunk or other surface that allows for a flat 
sleeping position and is located separate from both the flight deck and 
passenger cabin in an area that is temperature-controlled, allows the 
crewmember to control light, and provides isolation from noise and 
disturbance. 
o A Class 2 rest facility is a seat in an aircraft cabin that allows for a flat or 
near flat sleeping position; is separated from passengers by a minimum of 
a curtain to provide darkness and some sound mitigation; and is 
reasonably free from disturbance by passengers or crewmembers. 
 115 
 
o A Class 3 rest facility is a seat in an aircraft cabin or flight deck that 
reclines at least 40 degrees and provides leg and foot support.   
Rest Facilities – Installation 
There are three cost categories associated with the installation of rest facilities. 
First, there are one-time, non-recurring, design costs. These consist of system, 
development, engineering, analysis, and certification costs.  Second, there are ―kit‖ 
equipment costs for the hardware required for each installation.  Third, there is the cost of 
the labor required for rest facility installation. 
The FAA obtained detailed cost estimates from two supplemental type certificate 
(STC) holders.  Their estimates indicate that Class 1 facilities are much higher in cost 
relative to Class 2 and 3 facilities, which are roughly equivalent.  For the purposes of this 
analysis, FAA averaged the cost estimates from the two STC holders and summarized the 
costs into a per-installation cost. Table 37 presents the cost per installation used for this 
analysis.  
Table 37: Cost per Rest Facility Installation 
Rest Facility Class Cost per Installation
Class 1 $259,000 - $1,500,000
Class 2 $46,000
Class 3 $31,000
 
 116 
 
In order to estimate the total cost of on board rest facilities, the FAA multiplied 
the unit costs by the number of aircraft that could be affected by the rule (defined as 
aircraft that operate long range).  FAA believes that in the long term it is more cost 
effective for carriers to install rest facilities than to add pilots to the flightcrew.  FAA 
believes that no Class 2 or Class 3 rest facility will need to be added or upgraded on any 
of the aircraft currently used in international transportation because existing business or 
first class seats meet the requirements as Class 2 or Class 3 rest facilities.   
Rest facilities will need to be installed or upgraded on 104 aircraft used in 
international service.  Installation will be completed by the end of 2013.  Nineteen of 
these aircraft will have bunks installed at $1.5 million per aircraft and the remaining 85 
aircraft will have the single bunk facility upgraded to a double bunk facility at $250,000 
per aircraft. The total estimated cost is $49.8 million ($40.7 million present value).  This 
cost estimate does not include any weight penalty costs.  The FAA solicits public input 
regarding the weight penalty costs.                                .                 
Rest Facilities - Loss of Passenger Revenue 
There will be some passenger revenue loss associated with the use of rest 
facilities in augmented operations.  The FAA found that it is always cheaper to use a 
higher level rest facility than to add a flightcrew member.  As discussed in the previous 
section, Class 1 rest facilities will be installed in locations so that there is no impact on 
passenger revenue.  Existing business and first class seats meet the criteria to serve as  
Class 2 and Class 3 rest facilities.  Currently, most carriers assign flightcrew members to 
 117 
 
rest in coach seats during augmented operations.  The proposed rule will result in the loss 
of passenger revenue because carriers will need to assign flightcrew members to rest in 
Class 2 or 3 rest facilities (i.e. business/first class seats) rather than cheaper coach seats.  
The loss of passenger revenue is thus equal to the fare difference between business/first 
class seats and coach seats. 
FAA analyzed one year of actual flights to determine the categories and total 
number of aircraft and flights affected.  We multiply the estimated number of affected 
flights by the revenue lost when Class 2 or Class 3 rest facilities are used.  The weighted 
average additional incremental loss for a Class 2 rest facility
26
 is $2,034 and the weighted 
average cost for a Class 3 rest facility
27
 is $5,084.  We multiply the estimated number of 
annual flights by the appropriate estimated cost of the revenue lost.  The total cost would 
be $17.7 million. 
Table 38 shows the estimated annual operations for the most cost effective 
solutions based upon the proposed constraints, equipment, and number of pilots.   The 
FAA has analyzed the duty matrix and evaluated it in terms of the additional costs per 
pilot
28
 versus the costs of additional facilities and estimates that in the long run it would 
always be less costly to provide rest facilities rather than to add a pilot.
29
  Our analysis 
assumes that there are always three pilots available per flight and that carriers attempt to 
minimize the potential flightcrew costs.  For the flights that are 15.5 hours or more, a 
                                                          
26
 Weighted average price difference between coach and business class 
27
 Weighted average price difference between coach and estimated first class

 To estimate the hourly pilot cost of $625, we divide the approximate annual burdened pilot cost of 
$300,000 by the estimated hours flown per year of 480 (40 hours per month times 12 months per year).   
29
 Once the flight time exceeds 14 hours, additional crew would be required.   
 118 
 
Class 1 rest facility would be required, which would not result in any passenger revenue 
loss.

Summary of Benefits and Costs 
Following NTSB recommendations regarding pilot fatigue, labor and industry 
worked together to provide the basis of this rulemaking.  Furthermore, Congress has 
directed the FAA to issue a rule addressing pilot fatigue.  We have validated the need for 
this rule in the benefit discussion.   Based on the expected effectiveness of this proposed 
rule at preventing fatigue accidents with an averted fatality valued at $6 million, the 
simulation methodology produced benefits of $659.4 million with $463.8 million in 
present value.  The total estimated costs of the proposed rule over 10 years are $1.25 
billion ($804 million at present value).  There is over a 7 percent probability that 
undiscounted cost of avertable passenger airplane accidents would exceed $1.25 billion 
and over a 10 percent probability the present value of the cost of avertable passenger 
 120 
 
airplane accidents would exceed $796 million.  The benefits from a near term 
catastrophic accident in a 150-passenger airplane with average load factor exceeds the 
cost of this rule.  If  the value of an averted fatality were increased to $12.6 million, the 
present value of the benefits would equal the present value of compliance costs.     
In addition, the FAA has identified two additional areas of unquantified benefits: 
preventing minor aircraft damage on the ground, and the value of well rested pilots as 
accident preventors and mitigators.  Due to data limitations, the FAA was unable to 
estimate the cumulative effect of preventing minor aircraft damage on the ground, but if 
the rule were to reduce damage by  about $600 million over 10 years ($340 million 
present value) it would break even in terms of net benefits.  These considerations lend 
weight towards moving ahead with this proposal. FAA invites comment on this issue.

Appendix A 
Pilot Deviations and Accidents by Duty Hours 
a. Pilot Deviations 
Between 1987 and the present, there were 686 records of pilot deviations in part 121 
operations that contain information on pilot duty time in the 24 hours preceding the 
deviation (cases where equipment failure was listed for the deviation were excluded from 
the data set).  Table A-1 and Figure A-1 below show the frequency of pilot deviations in 
relation to duty time.  
As part of the analysis for this rulemaking, the FAA obtained data on pilot work patterns 
from ten carriers covering one month of flight activity during 1999.
30
  These data were 
used to create profiles of the work patterns of the pilot population.  Data for nine carriers 
were provided by pilot labor unions.  The FAA also obtained data on actual pilot use 
from one major part 121 air carrier that was added to data from the other carriers.

 FAA has also received more recent data on pilot work patterns from six carriers, covering two months of 
actual flight activity during 2009 for each carrier.  These data on flight crew exposure to risk are currently 
being characterized and analyzed by FAA, and these data have not yet been organized around the “for 
each duty hour, how many duty hours have occurred in the prior 24 hours?” parameter.  For this reason, 
the comparisons to occurrences of pilot deviations and accidents are made to the 1999 pilot work activity 
data.

The data was converted into one record for each pilot with a scheduled (or for one carrier, 
an actual) line of flying for the month.  Each pilot record tracked a pilot’s activity for 
every hour in the entire month.  The beginning and end of each trip segment were 
recorded for each pilot and put into a database.  Parameters of interest were then 
calculated such as the length of duty periods, flight time and duty time per day or in the 
last 24 hours, rest time, and the numbers of takeoffs and landings.  The analysis tracked 
these activities in local time as well as base time (defined as the time at the location 
where the pilot began a multi-day trip).  
 123 
 
Although some carriers provided data for both captains and first officers, other carriers 
provided data for captains only.  The study used data only for captains in the accident 
analysis to prevent weighing one carrier’s responses more heavily than another in 
measuring exposure.  The FAA found there were differences between the two sets of data 
in some work schedule parameters examined.                                   .

Table A-2 and Figure A-2 suggest that pilot deviations are less likely to occur when a 
pilot has less than 6 hours of duty time during the past 24 hours than if the pilot has more 
than 6 hours of duty time during the past 24 hours.  Moreover, pilot deviations after 6 
hours of duty time are much higher than one would expect given exposure.  This finding 
is consistent with the above fatigue science findings.

Appendix B 
Statistical Tests of Relationship between Length of Duty Time and Accidents 
The Flight Crewmember Duty and Rest Requirements NPRM accident analysis for the 
United States air transportation industry is based on statistical comparison of domestic flight 
crew duty data from six operators, based on their flight crews’ actual activity during a spring and 
summer month of 2009.  Two statistical testing methods were used to examine the distribution of 
pilot duty hours and the distribution of duty hour features of accident histories.  The statistical 
comparisons were made for the hour within a pilot duty period that a accident occurs.
32
  If the

 To illustrate, suppose the total available pilot duty data are comprised of two pilots, one of whom serves a duty 
period that is seven hours in length, and the second of whom serves a duty period of nine hours in length.  In this 
case, the data set characterizing pilot duty by hour in duty period contains two hours of duty in the first hour of 
the duty period, two hours of duty in the second hour of the duty period, and so forth, culminating in two hours of 
duty in the seventh hour of the duty period, one hour of duty in the eight hour of the duty period, and one hour of 
duty in the ninth hour of the duty period.  If, to continue the example, one of the pilots experiences an occurrence 
of interest in the seventh hour of her duty period, then the data set for “occurrences of interest” would contain 
one instance, taking place in the seventh hour of the duty period. 
 128 
 
likelihood of a human factors accident occurring is the same for all hours within a duty period, 
then the distribution of accident occurrence by the hour within a duty period should not be 
significantly different from the distribution of pilot duty hours by hour within the duty period, 
and the relative frequency of the occurrence of such accidents would be expected to resemble the 
relative frequency of hours within pilot duty periods.  The purpose of the statistical tests is to 
compare these two distributions and assess their similarity to or dissimilarity from one another 
using accepted statistical tools. 
 
There are 43 accidents in the data set.  They include accidents involving FAR part 121 
operators that resulted in significant aircraft damage, serious injury to passengers or worse 
outcomes, and occurred between 1990 and 2009.  They are accidents for which mechanical 
failures were not causal and in which human factors issues involving the flight crews were 
pertinent.  NTSB investigations and reports on some of these accidents cited ―fatigue‖ or pilot 
rest and duty issues as relevant to the accident.  The purpose of the statistical analysis is to 
examine the relationship if any between human factor accidents and duty patterns, the accident 
data set also includes human factors accidents for which no citation of ―fatigue‖ or similar 
factors was made. 
Duty period characteristics from the accident pilot histories are then categorized in a 
comparable way, with a count of all accidents in the data set that occurred in the first or second 
hour of the pilot’s duty period, the third or fourth hour of the pilots duty period, and so forth.   
This initial data set for 2009 pilot work patterns and accident incidence is reported in Table B-1.

While hour by hour duty period characteristics represent a sensible approach to 
identifying pilot exposure to human factors accident risk, some adjustment to these data is 
necessary for a valid comparison, since in some cases specific duty hours (or percentages of duty 
 130 
 
hours) can be shown to be unrelated to the possibility of aviation accident or mishap.  For this 
analysis, two specific adjustments are considered.   
 
First, it is nearly always the case that the first hour of a pilot’s duty day involves check-in 
and information gathering that takes place on the ground, prior to the first take off of the day.  
Naturally enough, every duty period has a first hour, and as can be seen in Table 1 above, the 
first hour makes up a significant percentage of total pilot duty hours, even though no flight 
activity occurs during it.  For this reason, in the following statistical tests the first hour of pilot 
duty periods is omitted from consideration. 
Second, once pilots have completed their first flight segment of the day (which lasts 
varying amounts of time depending on flight distance, itinerary, etc.), during any given  hour of 
pilot duty periods, some percentage of pilots are on the ground between flight segments and 
involved in post-flight or pre-flight activities.  Average flight segment lengths vary by airline and 
by airline business model, so it is not possible to develop specific modeling approaches to this 
issue. 
In the pilot exposure data made available by airlines for this analysis, out of 1,271,284 
total duty hours served (a total which excludes duty hours that are the pilot’s first duty hour of 
the day), there are 985,566 flight hours.  This suggests that about 77 per cent of duty hours 
actually involve accident risks stemming from flight activity, and that some adjustment to the 
distribution of duty hours counted over the duty period would be appropriate for accurately 
reflecting exposure to human factors accident risk.  Since duty hours begin to fall off 
significantly after the eighth hour of duty, as shown in Table B-1 above, and since once the final 
hours of a duty period are reached it is more likely that the pilot is in flight and performing his or 
her final segment of the duty day, this adjustment in the exposure data is accomplished by 
reducing the duty hours reported between the third and eighth duty hours of the duty period by 
30 percent.  The effect of this adjustment to exposure risk is illustrated in Table B-2, which 
updates the ―raw‖ exposure data from Table B-1.

The Pearson’s Chi Squared ―goodness of fit‖ test33 is a frequent approach to testing 
whether these two distributions – expressed as histograms reporting the percentage of each 
variable within each two hour time bucket – have a statistically significant difference.  If there is 
no statistically significant difference between the two distributions, there is limited evidence to

support a claim that accident likelihood changes with changes in duty hour.  An interpretation of 
this outcome is that the risk of accident does not vary with duty time.  Thus, for the statistical 
test, the null hypothesis is that there is not a statistically significant difference between the two 
distributions. 
To conduct the Chi Squared test, pilot duty hours from the exposure data set 
(disregarding the first hour of each pilot duty period) are divided into distinct categories of two 
hours in length: duty hours that occurred in the second or third hour of a duty period, duty hours 
that occurred in the fourth or fifth hour of a duty period, and so forth, with the final bucket made 
up of duty hours that occurred in the 14
th
 or greater hour of a duty period. 
The test statistic is taken from a Chi Squared distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, 
where n is the number of histograms used in the comparison of exposure and accident data.  In 
this case there are seven degrees of freedom for the text.  Table 3 reports these test results and 
the critical values for the Chi Squared test at the 5% and 10% significance levels.  The calculated 
Chi Squared test value of 131.5 exceeds these critical values, indicating that the distribution of 
exposure hours and the distribution of accident incidence within duty periods are not the same, 
although it is important to recognize that this outcome is driven largely by the comparison 
between exposure hours in the 14
th
 and greater hours of pilot duty periods and the frequency of 
accidents occurring during those later hours of pilot duty periods.

A second statistical test was also used to assess the significance, if any, of differences 
between the distribution of pilot duty hours observed in the 2009 exposure data and the 
 134 
 
distribution of the set of human factors accidents by the time at which the accidents occurred in 
the pilot’s duty period.  This test, which is also used to examine the similarity of distributions, is 
the two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (henceforth, K-S test), which is used to test whether 
two samples can be regarded as samples from a single distribution.
34
   
The K-S test is performed by expressing the exposure data and accident data as two 
separate cumulative distribution functions, each running from 0 to 100 per cent.  To make this 
comparison, some adjustment of the data sets being compared is made. 
Because data on accident time (that is, time within a duty period) exists at the hour and 
minute level, the exposure data is converted from hourly to ―by minute‖ data by dividing the 
percentage share of duty hours within an hour block by 60.  Consider a simple example where 
duty periods last 1 or 2 hours, and of 100 total duty hours, 60 are in the first hour block (from 0 
to 1 hours) and 40 are in the second hour block (from 1 to 2 hours).  In this case, 60 percent of 
duty hours are within the first hour block, and 40 percent are within the second hour block.  To 
convert this exposure profile from an hour basis to a minute basis, these percentages are divided 
by 60 (minutes per hour).  Thus, each minute within the first hour block represents one percent 
of the total minutes contained by the 100 duty hours, and each minute within the second hour 
block represents 0.667 percent contained by the 100 total duty hours. 
Table B-4 presents the ―risk adjusted‖ distribution of duty hours that is shown in TableB-
2 above along with the ―percentage of duty minutes within each duty hour‖ calculation described 
above.  In the 2009 exposure dataset for duty hours, about 13.1 percent of observed duty hours 
occur in someone’s second hour within a duty period (when first flights of the day commence 
and exposure to risk begins, as discussed above), and if this percentage share is subdivided into 
minutes, each of the 60 minutes with this second duty hour represents about 0.219% of all duty 
minutes over the 17 hour span between the second hour and the 18
th. 
 The reported exposure data 
also includes the reduction by 30 per cent of duty hours between the third and ninth hours in duty 
periods, to reflect the fact that during the middle portions of the duty day, some percentage of 
pilots are on the ground between flights.  They are actively engaged in their duties during these 
times, but they are not at risk of an in flight accident.

Also shown in Table B-4 are 43 accidents, which took place between 1990 and 2009, for which 
adequate data exists for identifying when within a duty period the accident occurred.  Thus, each 
accident represents 1/43, or 2.33 percent, of the total data set of accidents.  These accidents 
occurred at duty times up to 17 and a half hours, so the comparison constructed for the K-S test 
procedure looks at exposure data periods up to 18 hours in length, although there are relatively 
very few of these extremely long duty periods in the exposure data.  A graphical comparison of 
the cumulative duty minute distribution and the cumulative distribution of accidents by duty 
minute is shown in Figure B-2.  
Figure B-2. Comparison of Exposure and Accident Cumulative Percentage Profiles 
 
As shown in the figure, the two cumulative curves for exposure and accident duty times each rise 
to 100 percent, but do so along different paths or trajectories.  The purpose of the K-S test (like 
that of the Chi Squared test) is to test whether the two curves can be regarded as representing 
samples from distinct probability distributions.  In these tests, the statistical ―null hypothesis‖ is 
that the two distributions of events (duty hours served as a measure of exposure to risk, and 
 137 
 
accidents by the hour within the duty period at which the accident occurred) are the same.  If the 
statistical test (Chi Squared or K-S) results in the rejection of this null hypothesis at some level 
of significance, then with that level of confidence it can be asserted that exposure to risk is not 
summed up by relative numbers of hours within specific hours within the duty period, and that 
other factors, such as whether the duty hour at which an accident occurs is early or late in a duty 
period, also contribute to accident risk.  If the two curves are distinct from one another at a 
statistically significant level, it could be concluded that a pilot’s time within a duty period does 
influence the risk or likelihood of a human factors related accident occurring, and in this 
particular case, this risk increases with the duty time. 
The testing procedure for the K-S test of significant difference between two curves involves 
measuring the distance between the curves at each point.  The test statistic is the maximum of 
those distances, taken over the whole domain over which the two curves reach their terminal 
value of 100 percent.  In the present example, the maximum value is 0.2107, which occurs at 
minute 309, where the cumulative percentage for the exposure data reaches 60.6 per cent and the 
cumulative percentage for the accident data reaches 39.5 per cent. (The point or minute at which 
the maximum distance between these cumulative percentage curves occurs is not relevant to the 
test result.)  This distance is shown in Figure B-3.

The level of significance indicated by the test statistic depends on the number of accidents, since 
that sample size is much smaller than the sample size of exposure hours.  For each significance 
level of interest, such as 0.20, 0.15, 0.10, 0.05 or 0.01, the critical value is calculated by dividing 
a specific factor by the square root of the sample size of 43.  Table B-3, shows these factors and 
the associated critical value for the sample size of 43.

Comparison of these critical values with the test statistic at the 0.05 significance level of 0.2074 
indicates that at that level of significance, the difference between the cumulative curve of 
exposure times within duty periods and the cumulative curve of times within duty periods at 
which accidents occurred can be regarded as statistically significant.  This can be interpreted as 
indicating that the frequency with which accidents from the recent past happened within specific 
hours within a duty period is not related simply to the proportion of duty hours that pilots serve 
within specific hours of their duty period, and that the risk of an accident is not uniform across 
all hours within duty periods.  That is, with this level of significance, the hour of the duty period 
matters for accident risk.

Appendix C 
Pilot Deviations by Time of Day 
One way to study pilot deviations is examine how they vary throughout the day.  Deviations 
represent multiple types of violations, ranging from serious runway incursions interfering with 
landings and takeoffs to simple airspace transgressions. Given their potential severity, they are 
recorded system-wide because they are all assumed to represent precursors to potential accidents.  
Each violation record contains multiple fields addressing the aircraft, the environment and the 
pilot involved in the incident. These incidents number in the thousands.   These records provide a 
needed large sample to address the fatigue issue.  In particular, pilot deviations carry several data 
fields considered related to pilot fatigue. They are: (a) duty time in the last 24 hours before the 
violation, (b) flight time in the past 24 hours before the violation, (c) leg time before the 
violation, (d) time of day, and (e) season of the year.   
Pilot deviations are actions of the pilot which violate the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
previously called Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR). Pilot deviations also take place when the 
North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), Air Defense Identification Zone 
(ADIZ) tolerance is neglected.  Starting with 1987, pilot deviations have been documented by air 
traffic and flight standards on FAA Form 8020-17, Preliminary Pilot Deviation Report, and FAA 
Form 8020-18, Investigation of Pilot Deviation Report. The results are then coded into the Pilot 
Deviation System (PDS) database.  The FAA uses the PDS database to monitor the number of 
events, type of events (e.g., air deviations, surface deviations, or airspace violation) and the 
factors related to the events.  The FAA issues one report for each pilot deviation regardless of the 
number of aircraft involved.  The information in the database reflects a mix of preliminary and 
final reports. Pilot deviations require 90 days to stabilize due to reporting procedures, volume, 
and workload. 
A large sample from the database ranging from 1987 to present was secured and analyzed in 
multiple ways. To focus strictly on fatigue as the key issue, records with the following conditions 
were removed from the analysis: 
(a) improbable values, blanks, ―zero‖ in the field of interest, 
(b) non- Part 121 operations, and 
(c) deviations caused by adverse weather or equipment failure, two causes not truly being 
pilot-related. 
 140 
 
As can be seen in table C-1 and figure C-1 pilot deviations are more likely to occur in the 
afternoon than any other time of day.  Also, there are few pilot deviations between 12:00 
midnight and 6:00 am.

Deviations
 
The distribution of pilot deviations can be compared to the distribution of aircraft activity to see 
if pilot deviations are more than would be expected for any portion of the day.  In this analysis 
the count of takeoffs and landings by time of day were used as a measure of aircraft activity.  
The results are presented in table C-2 and figure C-2.

Deviations
Operations
 
 
Table C-2 and Figure C-2 show that a higher percentage of deviations occur late at night (0:001 
am to 4:00 am) than the percentage of takeoff and landing operations during those hours. The 
same can be said the afternoon and evening (12:01 pm to 10:00 pm).  During the morning (4:01 
am to 12:00 n) and late evening (10:01 pm to 12:00 m), the percentage of pilot deviations is 
lower then the percentage of operations during those times.  That pilot deviations are high 
relative to aircraft activity between midnight and 4:00 am is not too surprising given that people 
least alert during that period of time when they are in their window of circadian low, but it is a 
bit of a surprise that deviations are relatively low between 10:00 pm and midnight when many 
people go to sleep.  Most people are rested from a night’s sleep and are most alert during the 
morning so deviation should be expected to be relatively low during that time.  During the 
afternoon and evening, many people begin to become tired and less alert and deviations are 
expected to increase during that time. 
 
 Sometimes incidents have a more serious consequence than a deviation citation; sometimes the 
incident becomes an accident.  The above findings for pilot deviation incidents also apply to 
accidents.
