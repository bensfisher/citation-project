Administrative Simplification: 
Adoption of a Standard for a Unique 
Health Plan Identifier; Addition to the 
National Provider Identifier 
Requirements; and a Change to the 
Compliance Date for ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS Medical Data Code Sets 
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, HHS. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. 
SUMMARY: This proposed rule would 
implement section 1104 of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(hereinafter referred to as the Affordable 
Care Act) by establishing new 
requirements for administrative 
transactions that would improve the 
utility of the existing Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA) transactions and reduce 
administrative burden and costs. It 
proposes the adoption of the standard 
for a national unique health plan 
identifier (HPID) and requirements or 
provisions for the implementation of the 
HPID. This rule also proposes the 
adoption of a data element that will 
serve as an other entity identifier 
(OEID), an identifier for entities that are 
not health plans, health care providers, 
or ‘‘individuals,’’ that need to be 
identified in standard transactions. This 
proposed rule would also specify the 
circumstances under which an 
organization covered health care 
provider must require certain 
noncovered individual health care 
providers who are prescribers to obtain 
and disclose an NPI. Finally, this rule 
proposes to change the compliance date 
for the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD–10–CM) for diagnosis 
coding, including the Official ICD–10– 
CM Guidelines for Coding and 
Reporting, and the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision, Procedure Coding System 
(ICD–10–PCS) for inpatient hospital 
procedure coding, including the Official 
ICD–10–PCS Guidelines for Coding and 
Reporting, from October 1, 2013 to 
October 1, 2014.

I. Executive Summary and Background 
A. Executive Summary 
1. Purpose of the Regulatory Action 
a. Need for the Regulatory Action 
This rule proposes the adoption of a 
standard unique health plan identifier 
(HPID) and the adoption of a data 
element that will serve as an other 
entity identifier (OEID). This rule also 
proposes an addition to the National 
Provider Identifier (NPI) requirements. 
Finally, this rule proposes to change the 
compliance date for the ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS medical data code sets 
(hereinafter ‘‘code sets’’) from October 1, 
2013 to October 1, 2014. 
(1) HPID 
Currently, health plans and other 
entities that perform health plan 
functions, such as third party 
administrators and clearinghouses, are 
identified in Health Insurance 
Portability and Affordability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA) standard transactions with 
multiple identifiers that differ in length 
and format. Covered health care 
providers are frustrated by various 
problems associated with the lack of a

standard identifier, such as: improper 
routing of transactions; rejected 
transactions due to insurance 
identification errors; difficulty in 
determining patient eligibility; and 
challenges resulting from errors in 
identifying the correct health plan 
during claims processing. 
The adoption of the HPID and the 
OEID will increase standardization 
within HIPAA standard transactions 
and provide a platform for other 
regulatory and industry initiatives. 
Their adoption will allow for a higher 
level of automation for health care 
provider offices, particularly for 
provider processing of billing and 
insurance related tasks, eligibility 
responses from the health plans, and 
remittance advice that describes health 
care claim payments. 
(2) NPI 
In January 2004, the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
published a final rule establishing the 
standard for a unique health identifier 
for health care providers for use in the 
health care system and adopting the 
National Provider Identifier (NPI) as that 
standard. The rule also established the 
implementation specifications for 
obtaining and using the standard unique 
health identifier for health care 
providers. Since that time, pharmacies 
have encountered situations where they 
need to include the NPI of a prescribing 
health care provider in a pharmacy 
claim, but where the prescribing health 
care provider has been a noncovered 
health care provider who did not have 
an NPI because he or she was not 
required to obtain one. This situation 
has become particularly problematic in 
the Medicare Part D program. The 
proposed addition to the NPI 
requirements seeks to address this issue. 
(3) ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS Code 
Sets. 
On January 16, 2009, HHS published 
a final rule (74 FR 3328) in which the 
Secretary of HHS (the Secretary) 
adopted the ICD–10–CM and ICD–10– 
PCS (ICD–10) code sets as the HIPAA 
standards to replace the previously 
adopted International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical 
Modification, Volumes 1 and 2, 
including the Official ICD–9–CM 
Guidelines for Coding and Reporting 
(ICD–9–CM Volumes 1 and 2) and the 
International Classification of Diseases, 
9th Revision, Clinical Modification, 
Volume 3, including the Official ICD–9– 
CM Guidelines for Coding and 
Reporting (ICD–9–CM Volume 3) for 
diagnosis and procedure codes, 
respectively. The compliance date set by 
the final rule was October 1, 2013. 
Since that time, some provider groups 
have expressed strong concern about 
their ability to meet the October 1, 2013 
compliance date and the serious claims 
payment issues that might then ensue. 
Some providers’ concerns about being 
able to meet the ICD–10 compliance 
date are based, in part, on difficulties 
they have had meeting HHS’ 
compliance deadline for the adopted 
Associated Standard Committee’s (ASC) 
X12 Version 5010 standards (Version 
5010) for electronic health care 
transactions. Compliance with Version 
5010 and ICD–10 by all covered entities 
is essential to a smooth transition to the 
updated medical data code sets, as the 
failure of any one industry segment to 
achieve compliance would negatively 
impact all other industry segments and 
result in returned claims and provider 
payment delays. We believe the change 
in the compliance date for ICD–10, as 
proposed in this rule, would give 
providers and other covered entities 
more time to prepare and fully test their 
systems to ensure a smooth and 
coordinated transition by all industry 
segments. 
b. Legal Authority for the Regulatory 
Action 
(1) HPID 
This proposed rule implements 
section 1104(c) of the Affordable Care 
Act and section 1173(b)(1) of the Social 
Security Act (the Act) which require the 
adoption of a standard unique health 
plan identifier (HPID). 
(2) NPI 
This proposed rule would impose an 
additional requirement on covered 
organization health care providers 
under the authority of sections 
1173(b)(1) and 1175(b) of the Act. It 
would also accommodate the needs of 
certain types of health care providers in 
the use of the covered transactions, as 
required by section 1173(a)(3) of the 
Act. 
(3) ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
This proposed rule would set a new 
compliance date for the ICD–10 code 
sets, in accordance with section 
1175(b)(2) of the Act, under which the 
Secretary determines the date by which 
covered entities must comply with 
modified standards and implementation 
specifications. 
2. Summary of the Major Provisions 
a. HPID 
This rule proposes the adoption of the 
HPID as the standard for the unique 
identifier for health plans and 
definitions for ‘‘Controlling Health 
Plan’’ and ‘‘Subhealth Plan.’’ The 
proposed definitions of these two terms 
seek to differentiate between health plan 
entities that would be required to obtain 
an HPID, and those that would be 
eligible, but not required, to obtain an 
HPID. This rule also proposes to require 
all covered entities to use an HPID 
whenever a covered entity identifies a 
health plan in a covered transaction. 
Because health plans today have many 
different business structures and 
arrangements that affect how health 
plans are identified in standard 
transactions, these two proposed 
definitions also seek to enable health 
plans to obtain HPIDs to reflect differing 
business arrangements so they can be 
identified appropriately in standard 
transactions. 
This rule also proposes the adoption 
of a data element that would serve as an 
other entity identifier (OEID). The OEID 
would serve as an identifier for entities 
that are not health plans, health care 
providers, or ‘‘individuals’’ (as defined 
in 45 CFR 160.103), but that need to be 
identified in standard transactions 
(including, for example, third party 
administrators, transaction vendors, 
clearinghouses, and other payers). 
Under this proposed rule, these other 
entities would not be required to obtain 
an OEID, but they could obtain and use 
one if they needed to be identified in 
covered transactions. Because other 
entities are identified in standard 
transactions in a similar manner as 
health plans, we believe that 
establishing a data element to serve as 
an identifier for these entities will 
increase efficiency by encouraging the 
use of a uniform identifier. 
The most significant benefit of the 
HPID and the OEID is that they will 
increase standardization within HIPAA 
standard transactions by establishing 
uniform identifiers. 
b. NPI 
This rule proposes that an 
organization covered health care 
provider require certain noncovered 
individual health care providers who 
are prescribers to: (1) Obtain NPIs and; 
(2) to the extent the prescribers write 
prescriptions while acting within the 
scope of the prescribers’ relationship 
with the organization, disclose them to 
any entity that needs the NPIs to 
identify the prescribers in standard 
transactions. This addition to the NPI 
requirements would address the issue 
that pharmacies are encountering when 
the NPI of a prescribing health care 
provider needs to be included on a 
pharmacy claim, but the prescribing

22952 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
1 ‘‘Version 5010 and ICD–10 Readiness 
Assessment: Conducted among health Care 
providers, payers and Vendors for the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), December 
2011 (OMB Approval No: 09938–1149). The 
assessment surveyed 404 providers, 101 payers, and 
90 vendors, which represents 0.1% of all physician 
practices, 3% of hospitals, and 5% of health plans. 
2 An impact assessment for ICD–10 is performed 
by a covered entity to determine business areas, 
policies, processes and systems, and trading 
partners that will be affected by the transition to 
ICD–10. An impact assessment is a tool to aid in 
planning for implementation. ‘‘Survey: ICD–10 
Brief Progress,’’ February 2012, conducted by the 
Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI). 
health care provider does not have, or 
has not disclosed an NPI. 
c. ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
This rule proposes that the 
compliance date for ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS be changed from October 
1, 2013 to October 1, 2014. We believe 
this change will give covered entities 
the additional time needed to 
synchronize system and business 
process preparation and changeover to 
the updated medical data code sets. 
3. Costs and Benefits 
a. HPID 
The HPID is expected to yield the 
most benefit for providers, while health 
plans will bear most of the costs. Costs 
to all commercial and government 
health plans together (Medicare, 
Medicaid programs, IHS, VHA) are 
estimated to be $650 million to $1.3 
billion. However, commercial and 
government health plans are expected to 
make up those costs in savings. Further, 
it is our understanding that the industry 
will not find that the HPID is overly 
burdensome. Many entities have 
indicated that they have delayed regular 
system updates and maintenance, as 
well as the issuance or adoption of new 
health plan identification cards, to 
accommodate the adoption of the HPID. 
Health care providers can expect 
savings from two indirect consequences 
of HPID implementation: (1) The cost 
avoidance of decreased administrative 
time spent by providers interacting with 
health plans; and (2) a material cost 
savings through automation of processes 
for every transaction that moves from 
manual to electronic implementation. 
HPID’s anticipated 10-year return on 
investment for the entire health care 
industry is expected to be between $1 to 
$4.6 billion. (This estimate includes 
savings resulting from the foundational 
effect of the HPID rather than a precise 
budgetary prediction.) 
b. NPI 
The addition to the requirements for 
the NPI would have little impact on 
health care providers and on the health 
industry at large because few health care 
providers do not already have an NPI. 
In addition, covered organization health 
care providers may comply by various 
means. For example, a covered 
organization could use a simple verbal 
directive to prescribers whom they 
employ or contract with to meet the 
requirements. Alternately, a covered 
organization could update employment 
or contracting agreements with the 
prescribers. For these reasons, we 
believe the additional NPI requirements 
do not impose spending costs on State 
government or the private sector in any 
1-year of $136 million or more. 
c. Change of Compliance Date of ICD– 
10 
According to a recent survey 
conducted by CMS, up to one quarter of 
health care providers believe they will 
not be ready for the October 1, 2013 
compliance date.1 While the survey 
found no significant differences among 
practice settings regarding the 
likelihood of achieving compliance 
before the deadline, based on recent 
industry feedback we believe that larger 
health care health plans and providers 
generally are more prepared than 
smaller entities. The uncertainty about 
provider readiness is confirmed in 
another recent readiness survey in 
which nearly 50 percent of the 2,140 
provider respondents did not know 
when they would complete their impact 
assessment of the ICD–10 transition.2 
By delaying the compliance date of 
ICD–10 from October 1, 2013 to October 
1, 2014, we would be allowing more 
time for covered entities to prepare for 
the transition to ICD–10 and to conduct 
thorough testing. By allowing more time 
to prepare, covered entities may be able 
to avoid costly obstacles that would 
otherwise emerge while in production. 
Savings would come from the 
avoidance of costs that would occur as 
a consequence of significant numbers of 
providers being unprepared for the 
transition to ICD–10. In the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis (RIA) of this proposed 
rule, we estimate that there would be a 
cost avoidance of approximately $3.6 to 
nearly $8 billion in this regard. This 
range of estimates reflects the avoidance 
of two costly consequences that may 
occur should the compliance date 
remain October 1, 2013: (1) Both health 
care providers and health plans may 
have to process health care claims 
manually in order for claims to be paid; 
and (2) small health care providers may 
have to take out loans or apply for lines 
of credit in order to continue to provide 
health care in the face of delayed 
payments. 
In terms of costs, commercial health 
plans, medium and large hospitals, and 
large physician practices are far along in 
their ICD–10 implementation planning, 
and therefore have devoted funds, 
resources, and staff to the effort. 
According to our estimates, a 1-year 
delay of the ICD–10 compliance date 
would add 10 to 30 percent to the total 
cost that these entities have already 
spent or budgeted for the transition—an 
additional cost to commercial entities of 
approximately $1 to $6.4 billion. 
Medicare and State Medicaid Agencies 
have also reported estimates of costs of 
a change in the compliance date in 
recent informal polls. Accordingly, the 
calculations in the RIA in this proposed 
rule demonstrate that a 1-year delay in 
the compliance date of ICD–10 would 
cost the entire health care industry 
approximately $1 billion to $6.5 billion. 
We assume that the costs and cost 
avoidance calculated in the RIA will be 
incurred roughly over a 6- to 12-month 
period, from October 1, 2013 to October 
1, 2014. For simplicity sake, however, 
both the costs and the cost avoidance 
that result from a change in the 
compliance date of ICD–10 are 
calculated over the calendar year, 2014. 
We solicit comments on our 
assumptions and conclusions as 
described in the RIA.

22953 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA), (Pub. L. 104–191), enacted on 
August 21, 1996. HIPAA amended the 
Act by adding Part C–Administrative 
Simplification—to Title XI of the Act 
requiring the Secretary to adopt 
standards for certain electronic 
transactions to enable health 
information to be exchanged more 
efficiently and to achieve greater 
uniformity in the transmission of health 
information exchange. 
In the August 17, 2000 Federal 
Register (65 FR 50312), we published a 
final rule entitled ‘‘Health Insurance 
Reform: Standards for Electronic 
Transactions’’ (hereinafter referred to as 
the Transactions and Code Sets final 
rule). That rule implemented some of 
the HIPAA Administrative 
Simplification requirements by adopting 
standards developed by standard 
development organizations (SDOs) for 
certain electronic health care 
transactions and medical code sets to be 
used in those transactions. We adopted 
the Accredited Standards Committee 
(ASC) X12 standards Version 4010/ 
4010A1 and the National Council for 
Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) 
Telecommunication standard Version 
5.1, which is specified at 45 CFR part 
162, subparts K through R. All health 
plans, health care clearinghouses, and 
health care providers that transmit 
health information in electronic form in 
connection with a covered transaction 
(referred to as covered entities) are 
required to comply with these adopted 
standards. 
In the January 16, 2009 Federal 
Register (74 FR 3296), we published a 
final rule entitled, ‘‘Health Insurance 
Reform; Modifications to the Health 
Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) Electronic 
Transaction Standards’’ (the 
Modifications final rule), that, among 
other things, adopted updated versions 
of the standards for the electronic health 
care transactions for which the 
Department originally adopted 
standards in the Transactions and Code 
Sets final rule. These updated standards 
for electronic health care transactions 
included ASC X12 Version 5010 and 
NCPDP Telecommunication Standard 
Implementation Guide, Version D. 
Release 0 (Version D.0), and equivalent 
Batch Standard Implementation Guide, 
Version 1, Release 2 (Version 1.2). In the 
Modifications final rule, the Department 
also adopted the Medicaid pharmacy 
subrogation transaction, a new 
standard—the Batch Standard Medicaid 
Subrogation Implementation Guide, 
Version 3, Release 0). Covered entities 
are required to conduct as standard 
transactions all electronic transactions 
for which the Secretary has adopted a 
standard. From March 17, 2009 through 
December 31, 2011, covered entities 
were required to comply either with the 
ASC X12 Version 4010/4010A1 and 
NCPDP Telecommunications standard 
Version 5.1 standards or the updated 
Version 5010 and NCPDP D.0 standards. 
Effective January 1, 2012, covered 
entities were required to comply with 
Version 5010 and NCPDP D.0, and 
(except for small health plans) the 
Version 3.0 standard for Medicaid 
pharmacy subrogation transactions. 
Small health plans must comply with 
Version 3.0 on or after January 1, 2013. 
Also on January 16, 2009, we 
published a final rule entitled ‘‘HIPAA 
Administrative Simplification: 
Modification to Medical Data Code Set 
Standards to Adopt ICD–10–CM and 
ICD–10–PCS’’ (74 FR 3328). In the ICD– 
10 final rule, we adopted the 
International Classification of Diseases, 
10th Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD–10–CM), including the Official 
ICD–10–CM Guidelines for Coding and 
Reporting, as maintained and 
distributed by HHS, for the following 
conditions: (1) diseases; (2) injuries; (3) 
impairments; (4) other health problems 
and their manifestations; and (5) causes 
of injury, disease, impairment, or other 
health problems. We also adopted the 
International Classification of Diseases, 
10th Revision, Procedure Coding 
System (ICD–10–PCS), including the 
Official ICD–10–PCS Guidelines for 
Coding and Reporting, as maintained 
and distributed by HHS, for the 
following procedures or other actions 
taken for diseases, injuries, and 
impairments of hospital inpatients 
reported by hospitals: (1) prevention; (2) 
diagnosis; (3) treatment; and (4) 
management. 
Table 1 summarizes the full set of 
transaction standards adopted in the 
Transactions and Code Sets final rule 
and as modified in the Modifications

22954 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
In general, the transaction standards 
adopted under HIPAA enable electronic 
data interchange (EDI) using a common 
interchange structure, thus minimizing 
the industry’s need to rely on multiple 
formats. The standards significantly 
decrease administrative burden on 
covered entities by creating greater 
uniformity in data exchange, and 
reducing the amount of paper forms 
needed for transmitting data, which 
remains an obstacle to achieving greater 
health care industry administrative 
simplification. 
Section 1172(a) of the Act states that 
‘‘[a]ny standard adopted under [Part C— 
Administrative Simplification—of Title 
XI of the Social Security Act, as 
amended by section 262 of HIPAA] shall 
apply, in whole or in part, to the 
following persons: (1) A health plan; (2) 
A health care clearinghouse; and (3) A 
health care provider who transmits any 
health information in electronic form in 
connection with a [HIPAA 
transaction].’’ 
Section 1173(b) of the Act directs the 
Secretary to adopt standards providing 
for a standard unique health identifier 
for each individual, employer, health 
plan, and health care provider for use in 
the health care system. In the May 31, 
2002 Federal Register (67 FR 38009), we 
published a final rule entitled, ‘‘Health 
Insurance Reform: Standard Unique 
Employer Identifier,’’ which adopted 
the standard for a unique employer 
identifier in HIPAA electronic health 
care transactions. In the January 23, 
2004 Federal Register (69 FR 3434), we 
published a final rule entitled, ‘‘HIPAA 
Administrative Simplification: Standard 
Unique Health Identifier for Health Care 
Providers’’ (the 2004 NPI final rule), in 
which the Secretary adopted the 
National Provider Identifier (NPI) as the 
standard unique health care provider 
identifier and the requirements for 
obtaining and using the NPI. Health care 
providers that transmit any health 
information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a standard 
(known as ‘‘covered health care 
providers’’), are required to obtain NPIs 
and use them according to the NPI 
regulations at 45 CFR part 162, subpart 
D. Specifically, under the requirements 
for health care providers at 45 CFR 
162.410, a covered health care provider 
must obtain an NPI for itself and some 
of its subparts, use the NPI in standard 
transactions it conducts, and disclose its 
NPI to any entities that need it for 
standard transactions. The Secretary has 
not adopted a standard patient 
identifier. 
Under section 1172(c)(2)(B) of the 
Act, if no standard setting organization 
has developed, adopted, or modified 
any standard relating to a standard that 
the Secretary is authorized or required 
to adopt under the Administrative 
Simplification provisions of HIPAA, 
then the Secretary may adopt a 
standard, relying upon 
recommendations of the NCVHS. In 
such a case, the Secretary shall publish 
in the Federal Register any 
recommendation of the NCVHS 
regarding the adoption of a standard 
under the HIPAA Administrative 
Simplification provisions. Further, the 
Secretary must consult with the 
National Uniform Billing Committee 
(NUBC), the National Uniform Claim 
Committee (NUCC), the Workgroup for 
Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI), and 
the American Dental Association (ADA), 
other appropriate private organizations, 
and appropriate Federal and State 
agencies regarding such standard 
adoption. 
In this proposed rule, we address the 
adoption of a unique health plan 
identifier, the adoption of a data 
element that would serve as an 
identifier for other entities, an addition 
to the NPI requirements, and a change 
to the compliance date for the ICD–10– 
CM and ICD–10–PCS code sets. 
C. The Unique Health Plan Identifier 
(HPID) and the Affordable Care Act 
Section 1104(c)(1) of the Affordable 
Care Act, enacted on March 23, 2010, 
directs the Secretary to promulgate a 
final rule establishing a unique health 
plan identifier that is based on the input 
of a Federal advisory committee, the 
National Committee on Vital and Health 
Statistics (NCVHS). Section 1104 of the 
Affordable Care Act authorizes the 
Secretary to promulgate the rule on an 
interim final basis and indicates that 
such rule shall be effective not later 
than October 1, 2012. 
Health plans are currently identified 
for different purposes using different 
identifiers that have different sources, 
formats, and meaning. A health plan 
may have multiple identifiers, each 
assigned by a different organization for 
a different purpose. The following 
discussion focuses on the types of 
identifiers that currently may be used to 
identify health plans in standard 
transactions. State regulators, for 
instance, use the National Association 
of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) 
Company code to identify health plans 
when a health plan is licensed to sell or 
offer health insurance in a particular 
State. The U.S. Department of Labor 
(DOL) and the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) use the 9-digit Employer 
Identification Number (EIN) and a 1- 
digit alphabetic or a 3-digit plan number 
to identify health plans. Employers, sole 
proprietorships, corporations, 
partnerships, non-profit associations, 
trusts, estates of decedents, government 
agencies, certain individuals, and other 
business entities, use EINs to identify 
health plans for a host of purposes and 
transactions. The IRS uses the EIN to 
identify taxpayers that are required to 
file various business tax returns. Health 
care clearinghouses assign proprietary 
identifiers to health plans for use in 
standard transactions. Multiple 
clearinghouses may identify the same 
health plan using different proprietary 
identifiers in different covered 
transactions. Health plans may use other 
existing identifiers, such as a tax 
identification number (TIN) or an EIN, 
to identify themselves in the standard 
transactions, to more easily integrate 
into existing proprietary systems, or for 
use on health insurance cards that they 
issue to health plan enrollees. 
Not only are health plans identified 
using a variety of identifiers, but these 
identifiers have different formats. For 
instance, some identifiers are 
alphanumeric while other identifiers are 
only numeric. Identifiers also differ in 
length; for example, NAIC codes are 
typically five digits while an EIN is nine 
digits. 
The current versions of the adopted 
standards (ASC X12N and NCPDP) 
allow health plans to use these and 
other identifiers in standard 
transactions. Therefore, for the covered 
transactions there is no requirement for 
consistency in the use of identifiers for 
health plans. Health care providers, 
health plans, and healthcare 
clearinghouses may use EINs, TINs, 
NAIC numbers, healthcare 
clearinghouse, or health plan assigned 
proprietary numbers to identify health 
plans in standard transactions. Industry 
stakeholders, especially health care 
providers, have indicated that the lack 
of a standard unique health plan 
identifier has resulted in increased costs 
and inefficiencies in the health care 
system. Health care providers are 
frustrated by problems with: the routing 
of transactions; rejected transactions 
due to insurance identification errors; 
difficulty determining patient eligibility; 
and challenges resolving errors 
identifying the health plan during 
claims processing. 
The Affordable Care Act specifically 
calls for the establishment of a unique 
identifier for health plans. There are 
however, other entities that are not 
health plans but that perform certain 
health plan functions and are currently 
identified in the standard transactions 
in the same fields using the same types 
of identifiers as health plans. For

example, health care clearinghouses, 
third party administrators (TPAs), and 
repricers often contract with insurance 
companies, self-funded employer health 
care plans, and provider- or hospital-run 
health plans to perform claims 
administration, premium collection, 
enrollment, and other administrative 
functions. In some cases, TPAs or other 
entities are identified in the same fields 
as health plans in the transactions, 
depending on the contractual 
relationships. As explained later in this 
proposed rule, we propose to adopt a 
data element—an other entity 
identifier—to serve as an identifier for 
these other entities. 
D. The National Committee on Vital and 
Health Statistics (NCVHS) 
In section 1104 of the Affordable Care 
Act, the Secretary is directed to conduct 
its rulemaking to establish a unique 
health plan identifier based on input of 
the NCVHS. Congress created the 
NCVHS to serve as an advisory body to 
the Secretary on health data, statistics, 
and national health information policy. 
The NCVHS has been assigned a 
significant role in the Secretary’s 
adoption of all standards, code sets, and 
operating rules under HIPAA, including 
the unique health plan identifier. In 
section 1104(c)(1) of the Affordable Care 
Act, Congress reiterated that the NCVHS 
would retain its role in providing input 
on the establishment of the health plan 
identifier. 
The NCVHS Subcommittee on 
Standards fulfilled these duties by 
conducting public hearings on the 
health plan identifier on July 19 through 
21, 2010. Industry stakeholders, 
including representatives from health 
plans, health care provider 
organizations, health care 
clearinghouses, pharmacy industry 
representatives, standards developers, 
professional associations, 
representatives of Federal and State 
public programs, the Workgroup on 
Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI), the 
National Uniform Billing Committee 
(NUBC), the National Uniform Claim 
Committee (NUCC), and individuals 
with health plan identifier proposals 
provided in-person and written 
testimony. Stakeholder testimony at the 
hearings focused on the use and need 
for an HPID to: facilitate the appropriate 
routing of transactions; reduce the cost 
of managing financial and 
administrative information; improve the 
accuracy and timeliness of claims 
payment; and reduce dissatisfaction 
among health care providers and 
patients/members by improving 
communications with health plans and 
their intermediaries. Stakeholders 
provided suggestions on the types of 
entities that need to be identified in 
standard transactions, those that should 
be eligible to obtain an HPID, and the 
level of enumeration for each plan (for 
example the legal entity, product, 
benefit package etc). We discuss the 
specifics of key issues in more detail 
later in this proposed rule. 
1. Eligibility for an HPID 
There was substantial testimony on 
the types of entities that should obtain 
an identifier and a request that HHS 
clearly indicate the organizations that 
would be required to obtain and use an 
identifier in standard transactions. 
Testifiers also offered extensive input 
on the need to provide an identifier for 
entities that do not meet the definition 
of health plan under HIPAA, but have 
a need to be identified in standard 
transactions. The majority of those 
testifying recommended that these 
entities, such as TPAs and health care 
clearinghouses, be eligible to obtain an 
identifier for use in the standard 
transactions. 
2. HPID Enumeration Level 
Stakeholders offered extensive input 
on the appropriate level of health plan 
enumeration. Testifier suggestions 
ranged from requiring health plans to 
enumerate at the highest level (that is 
the parent company), to enumerating 
every health plan benefit package (for 
example ‘‘HMO Gold’’). Some testifiers 
proposed that there be two types of 
health plan identifiers, and they used 
the term ‘‘plan’’ to mean both the health 
plan products and health plan 
organizations—Type 1 and Type 2 
identifiers, respectively. As reflected in 
written testimony submitted to the 
NCVHS, they proposed that the Type 1 
identifier identify patient-specific 
health plan products, for instance, a 
particular health insurance product, or 
an employee health benefit plan or other 
product defining the patient’s coverage. 
The Type 2 identifier would identify 
organizations that perform health plan 
functions, such as entities issuing long- 
term care policies, plan organizations 
paying for the cost of medical care for 
specified populations, or entities 
responsible for funding high risk pools 
offering coverage to eligible individuals. 
Some testifiers also suggested that the 
Type 2 identifier also identify entities 
other than health plans that perform 
certain administrative or contracting 
functions on behalf of health plans, 
such as TPAs or health care 
clearinghouses. In addition, some of 
these testifiers recommended the 
creation of a fee schedule identifier so 
health care providers could download 
the appropriate fee schedule, just as the 
entity that is administering the claims 
transaction must do to price the claim. 
Other testifiers opined that 
enumeration should occur at a health 
plan organization level and should 
support the ability to obtain and utilize 
a more granular enumeration scheme if 
there is a business need for further 
differentiation to appropriately route 
transactions. This proposal was based 
on the premise that the purpose of the 
HPID is to identify entities that meet the 
regulatory definition of health plan and 
are conducting the covered transactions. 
The HPID will be used to identify a 
health plan that sends or receives the 
covered transactions. These testifiers 
cautioned that requiring fee schedule, 
reimbursement information, or product 
level information in the HPID would 
create a level of complexity that would 
greatly increase the number of 
identifiers needed, resulting in 
significant health plan maintenance 
requirements, increased cost, and 
inefficiencies. These testifiers 
recommended that associating product 
information with particular identifiers 
should not be a goal of the HPID, 
although it could be addressed in future 
versions of the standards, 
implementation guides, or operating 
rules. 
3. Timing 
Stakeholders at the NCVHS hearings 
also stressed the importance of a smooth 
transition from current plan identifiers 
to the HPID during the enumeration 
process, given its potential impact on 
the industry. For example, they noted 
that health plan and health care 
provider information systems will need 
to be reprogrammed to accommodate 
the HPID, including the possible 
expansion of data fields and the creation 
of crosswalks between existing 
proprietary identifiers and the HPID. 
Health care clearinghouses and health 
IT vendors will need to update their 
systems to accommodate the new 
identifiers, and may also need to create 
identifier crosswalks to match current 
health plan identifiers to the HPID and 
vice versa. Health plans will need to 
conduct an analysis of their 
organizations and structure to 
determine, if they have subsidiaries, 
which of their entities qualify as health 
plans and need to be enumerated. The 
HPID may also impact information 
systems that involve Health Level 7 
(HL7) standard protocols. Testimony 
from the HL7 SDO noted that it is likely 
that the HPID may require changes to 
existing scheduling, registration, pre- 
admission, admission, and other 
information systems and their screens,

work flows, and data elements 
collected, stored, displayed, and 
processed by those applications. In 
addition, testifiers pointed out other 
regulatory requirements with similar, 
converging compliance dates, such as: 
January 1, 2012 for complying with 
Version 5010, Version D.0 and Version 
3.0; October 1, 2013 for complying with 
the ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
medical code sets requirements; January 
1, 2013 for implementing the first set of 
operating rules for two of the standard 
transactions; and other changes under 
the Affordable Care Act all require 
limited industry resources. 
Finally, there was testimony related to 
the use of health plan identifiers in the 
retail pharmacy transactions, and we 
address this topic later in this proposed 
rule. (For transcripts and testimony of 
the July 19 and 20, 2010 NCVHS 
Subcommittee on Standards hearings, 
go to http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov.) 
E. The NCVHS Recommendation to the 
Secretary on HPID 
On September 30, 2010, following the 
July 2010 NCVHS Subcommittee on 
Standards hearing, the NCVHS sent a 
letter to the Secretary with its 
recommendations for the adoption of a 
standard for a health plan identifier. 
The nine NCVHS observations 
addressed the following topics: (1) The 
definitions and types of entities eligible 
for enumeration with an HPID; (2) the 
level of entity enumeration; (3) the 
format and content of the HPID; (4) the 
directory database to support the HPID 
enumeration system and process; (5) the 
implementation of the HPID in retail 
pharmacy; (6) the implementation 
process and timing; (7) applicable 
testing of the HPID enumeration 
process; (8) the use of the HPID on 
health plan identification cards, and (9) 
the improvement in the use of standards 
and operating rules. The specific 
recommendations are as follows: 
‘‘HHS should: 
• 1.1 clarify the definition of health 
plan as specified in the HIPAA 
regulations (45 CFR 160.103) for 
purposes of HPID eligibility and 
enumeration, including that property 
and casualty insurers and workers’ 
compensation plans could be eligible for 
such enumeration even though they are 
not covered entities. 
• 1.2 work with stakeholders to 
reach consensus on names and 
definitions for intermediary entities. 
Consider making these intermediary 
entities eligible to obtain an HPID where 
there is a clear use case for them to be 
enumerated. 
• 1.3 request stakeholder input 
through groups such as Workgroup on 
Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI), 
America’s Health Insurance Plans 
(AHIP), National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and 
the Designated Standards Maintenance 
Organizations (DSMO) Committee for 
definitions of products to be used in 
plan enumeration by October 31, 2010 
(or other date as deemed feasible by 
CMS). 
• 1.4 collaborate across Federal 
agencies and departments to develop or 
identify consensus definitions affecting 
the identification of health plans, 
including Indian Health Service (IHS), 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 
Department of Defense (DoD), and the 
Federal Employee Health Benefit 
Program (FEHBP). 
• 1.5 coordinate, to the maximum 
extent feasible, the development and 
implementation of the HPID with other 
plan related requirements in the 
Affordable Care Act, including, for 
example, the consumer health insurance 
web portal, the health insurance 
exchanges and the regulatory 
requirements for health plans. 
• 2.1 initially enumerate all health 
plan legal entities as defined in the 
HIPAA legislation and further clarified 
in regulations at 45 CFR 160.103. 
• 2.2 determine at what level, 
including product (benefit package) 
level or other categorization, a health 
plan should also be enumerated, using 
input from stakeholders, and identify 
these in regulation. 
• 3.1 adopt an HPID that follows the 
ISO Standard 7812, with Luhn check- 
digit as the tenth digit. 
• 3.2 adopt an HPID that contains 
no embedded intelligence. 
• 4.1 establish an HPID enumeration 
system and process supported by a 
robust online directory database. 
• 4.2 direct CMS to work with 
stakeholders including other Federal 
agencies to identify the minimum 
necessary data elements for the 
directory database. Consideration 
should be given to including the 
Employer Identification Number (EIN), 
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), 
National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (NAIC) identifier, 
Source of Payment Typology, and other 
identifiers that may assist in supporting 
the need to appropriately identify health 
plans in administrative transactions and 
in the updating, development and/or 
effective use of standards and operating 
rules. The database should be 
sufficiently flexible to enable additional 
information to be added initially at the 
discretion of the entity, and potentially 
in the future, as a requirement by HHS. 
• 4.3 require the entity enumerated 
to maintain all information according to 
a published schedule of updates or more 
often as appropriate, to maintain 
accuracy. If there are no changes at the 
time of a scheduled update, the date 
information was validated should 
signify that the entity has reviewed and 
is confirming the data as being current. 
• 4.4 make available appropriate 
information from the HPID directory 
database to support the efficient and 
accurate exchange of information. 
• 4.5 consider, for the future, 
requiring that the HPID system enable 
electronic transactions with the 
directory database for users or their 
systems to obtain information and route 
transactions more efficiently and 
effectively. 
• 5.1 not require the HPID to be 
used in place of the existing RxBIN/PCN 
identifier in retail pharmacy business 
and transactions. 
• 5.2 require the use of HPID on the 
HIPAA-named standard transactions for 
retail pharmacy, where appropriately 
defined by industry through the ASC 
X12 and NCPDP processes. 
• 6.1 consider that the effective date 
of October 1, 2012 be interpreted as the 
date to begin registering for an HPID. As 
such, subsequent phases should include 
time for enumeration and testing before 
a final implementation date when the 
HPID must be used in compliant 
transactions. This will ensure sufficient 
time for publication of the regulation 
and development of the enumeration 
system and process. Phases should 
include: 
• October 1, 2012—March 31, 2013: 
Enumeration 
• April 1, 2013—September 30, 2013: 
Testing 
• October 1, 2013: Implementation 
• 6.2 describe in regulation the 
potential purposes and uses of the 
HPID, including its uses in standard 
transactions, potential uses for health 
information exchange, and others. 
While purposes should not be restricted, 
the initial focus should be on 
enumerating entities for use in the 
financial and administrative 
transactions required under HIPAA. 
• 6.3 accommodate bulk 
enumeration of HPID as applicable. 
• 7.1 provide sufficient time and 
guidance for testing the HPID in 
transactions prior to use. 
• 7.2 allow for a period during 
which dual use of legacy health plan 
identifiers and the new HPID is 
permitted in the transactions as 
appropriate. 
• 8.1 encourage the use of the HPID 
in health plan identification cards. 
• 9.1 strongly encourage the 
industry to collaborate to enhance 
operating rules for the financial and

For the complete text of the NCVHS’ 
observations and recommendations, go 
to http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/ 
100930lt1.pdf. 
We agree in principle with the spirit 
and intent of the NCVHS’ 
recommendation to the Secretary for a 
health plan identifier standard as 
relayed in the September 30, 2010 letter. 
In this proposed rule, we propose to 
adopt a health plan identifier based in 
large part upon the NCVHS’ 
recommendations, with some minor 
departures. In section II. of this 
proposed rule, we itemize our proposals 
and, where necessary, explain the 
differences between the HHS proposal 
and the NCVHS’ recommendations. 
F. Definition of Health Plan 
The regulatory definition of health 
plan at 45 CFR 160.103 was initially 
adopted in the Transactions and Code 
Sets final rule. The basis for the 
additions to, and clarifications of, the 
statutory definition of health plan is 
further discussed in the preamble to the 
December 28, 2000 final rule (65 FR 
82478 and 82576) entitled ‘‘Standards 
for Privacy of Individually Identifiable 
Health Information’’ (hereinafter 
referred to as the Privacy Rule). The 
term ‘‘health plan’’ is defined at 45 CFR 
160.103. 
This definition of ‘‘health plan’’ 
references group health plans, health 
insurance issuers, and health 
maintenance organizations that are also 
defined in 45 CFR 160.103. These 
definitions are included here: 
Group health plan (also see definition 
of health plan in this section) means an 
employee welfare benefit plan (as 
defined in section 3(1) of the Employee 
Retirement Income and Security Act of 
1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1002(1)), 
including insured and self-insured 
plans, to the extent that the plan 
provides medical care (as defined in 
section 2791(a)(2) of the Public Health 
Service Act (PHS Act), 42 U.S.C. 300gg– 
91(a)(2)), including items and services 
paid for as medical care, to employees 
or their dependents directly or through 
insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise, 
that: 
(1) Has 50 or more participants (as 
defined in section 3(7) of ERISA, 29 
U.S.C. 1002(7)); or 
(2) Is administered by an entity other 
than the employer that established and 
maintains the plan. 
Health insurance issuer (as defined in 
section 2791(b)(2) of the PHS Act, 42 
U.S.C. 300gg–91(b)(2) and used in the 
definition of health plan in this section) 
means an insurance company, insurance 
service, or insurance organization 
(including an HMO) that is licensed to 
engage in the business of insurance in 
a State and is subject to State law that 
regulates insurance. Such term does not 
include a group health plan. 
Health maintenance organization 
(HMO) (as defined in section 2791(b)(3) 
of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300gg–91(b)(3) 
and used in the definition of health plan 
in this section) means a Federally 
qualified HMO, an organization 
recognized as an HMO under State law, 
or a similar organization regulated for 
solvency under State law in the same 
manner and to the same extent as such 
an HMO. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule To 
Adopt a Standard for a Unique Health 
Plan Identifier (HPID) 
This rule proposes an HPID as the 
standard for the unique identifier for 
health plans. We are also proposing 
instructions and guidance concerning 
how health plans may obtain an HPID. 
We further propose requirements that 
covered entities will have to meet to use 
the unique health plan identifier in 
standard transactions. This proposed 
rule would add provisions specific to 
the HPID in a new subpart (subpart E) 
to 45 CFR part 162. 
A. The Health Plan Identifier 
1. Definition of ‘‘Controlling Health 
Plan’’ and ‘‘Subhealth Plan’’ 
Health plans today have many 
different business structures and 
arrangements that affect how health 
plans are identified in standard 
transactions. There is often a ‘‘parent’’ 
corporation that meets the definition of 
health plan, which may be controlled by 
entities, such as holding companies, 
that do not meet the definition of health 
plan. This ‘‘parent’’ health plan may 
own and operate several other entities 
and organizations, which may also meet 
the definition of a health plan. While 
these individual health plans that are 
owned by the same ‘‘parent’’ 
corporation may have their own EIN or 
NAIC number, they may all use a single 
identifier in covered transactions 
because of data processing 
arrangements. In these situations, some 
health plans may not need to be 
identified separately in covered 
transactions, and may not need their 
own health plan identifier. To 
differentiate between health plan 
entities that would be required to obtain 
an HPID, and those that would be 
eligible, but not required, to obtain an 
HPID, we are proposing definitions for 
controlling health plan (CHP) and 
subhealth plan (SHP) in proposed 45 
CFR 162.103 as follows. 
a. Controlling Health Plan (CHP) 
We would define a CHP as a health 
plan (as defined at 45 CFR 160.103) 
that—(1) controls its own business 
activities, actions, or policies; or is 
controlled by an entity that is not a 
health plan (2) and if it has a subhealth 
plan(s) (SHPs) (see definition of SHP in 
subpart b), exercises sufficient control 
over the subhealth plan(s) to direct its/ 
their business activities, actions, or 
policies. 
The following factors would need to 
be considered when determining if an 
entity is a CHP: 
• Does the entity itself meet the 
definition of health plan at 45 CFR 
160.103? 
• Does either the entity itself or a non 
health plan organization control the 
business activities, actions, or policies 
of the entity? 
If the answer to both questions is 
‘‘yes,’’ then the entity meets the 
definition of CHP. We propose that an 
entity that meets the definition of CHP 
would be required to obtain a health 
plan identifier. 
b. Subhealth Plan (SHP) 
A SHP would mean a health plan (as 
defined in 45 CFR 160.103) whose 
business activities, actions, or policies 
are directed by a CHP. The following 
considerations may be helpful in 
determining whether an entity is a SHP: 
• Does the entity meet the definition 
of health plan at § 160.103? 
• Does a CHP direct the activities, 
actions, or policies of the health plan 
entity? 
If the answer to both questions is 
‘‘yes,’’ then the entity meets the 
definition of SHP. We propose that a 
SHP would not be required to obtain an 
HPID, but may choose to obtain an 
HPID, or its CHP may obtain an HPID 
on its behalf. 
2. Proposed Use of the HPID 
In proposed 45 CFR 162.510, we 
propose HPID usage requirements for all 
covered entities. We propose to require 
all covered entities to use an HPID 
wherever a covered entity identifies a 
health plan in a covered transaction. 
Covered entities would obtain the 
HPIDs of health plans from the health 
plans themselves or from the 
Enumeration System, which we 
describe later in this proposed rule. If a 
covered entity uses a business associate 
to conduct standard transactions on its 
behalf, the covered entity must require 
that its business associate use an HPID 
in each field where the business

associate identifies a health plan in all 
covered transactions. 
The HPID may also be used for any 
other lawful purpose that requires the 
identification of health plans. 
Some examples of permitted uses 
include the following: 
• Health plans may use HPIDs in 
their internal files to facilitate 
processing of health care transactions. 
• A health plan may use an HPID on 
a health insurance card. 
• The HPID may be used as a cross- 
reference in health care fraud and abuse 
files and other program integrity files. 
• Health care clearinghouses may use 
HPIDs in their internal files to create 
and process standard and non-standard 
transactions, and in communications 
with health plans and health care 
providers. 
• HPIDs may be used in patient 
medical records to help specify patients’ 
health care benefit package(s). 
• HPIDs may be used to identify 
health plans in electronic health records 
(EHRs). 
• HPIDs may be used to identify 
health plans in Health Information 
Exchanges (HIEs). 
• HPIDs may be used to identify 
health plans in Federal and State health 
insurance exchanges. 
• HPIDs may be used to identify 
health plans for public health data 
reporting purposes. 
3. Proposed Health Plan Identifier 
Requirements for Health Plans 
In 45 CFR 162.512, we propose HPID 
implementation specifications for health 
plans. We propose to require all CHPs, 
as defined in 45 CFR 162.103, to obtain 
HPIDs from the Enumeration System in 
accordance with the enumeration 
process, which is described later in this 
proposed rule. In addition, CHPs could 
obtain HPIDs from the Enumeration 
System on behalf of their SHPs, as 
defined in 45 CFR 162.103, or direct 
their SHPs to obtain HPIDs directly from 
the Enumeration System. Any SHP 
would be eligible to obtain an HPID 
regardless of whether or not its CHP 
directs it to obtain an HPID. A CHP 
could only obtain one HPID for itself. 
We propose to require each health 
plan to disclose its HPID to any entity, 
upon request, that needs the HPID to 
identify that health plan in a standard 
transaction. We propose to require each 
health plan to ensure that its own data 
in the Enumeration System is correct 
and that each health plan submits 
changes (updates, corrections, etc.) to its 
own data to the Enumeration System 
within 30 days of the date the change 
took place. A SHP would ultimately be 
responsible for submitting updates for 
its own data in the Enumeration System 
regardless of whether it obtained its 
HPID independently or the CHP 
obtained the HPID on its behalf. We are 
requesting comments on whether a SHP 
should be responsible for submitting 
updates to its own data if a CHP 
obtained the HPID on its behalf. 
This proposed rule provides a 
discussion on how CHPs and SHPs will 
obtain an HPID from the Enumeration 
System. Health plans would be able to 
begin to apply for an HPID on or after 
the effective date of the final rule, which 
we expect to be October 1, 2012, and 
must use it in standard transactions by 
the compliance date of the final rule. 
a. Requirements and Options for 
Obtaining and Using a Health Plan 
Identifier 
While a CHP would be required to 
obtain a health plan identifier, there 
would be different options available for 
the enumeration of SHPs based on a 
CHP’s organizational structure and 
business needs. The CHP may analyze 
its organizational structure to determine 
if and which of its SHPs need a HPID 
based on whether the SHP needs to be 
identified in covered transactions. The 
CHP may obtain HPIDs on behalf of its 
SHP, or it may direct the SHPs to obtain 
the HPIDs. While a CHP could only 
obtain 1 HPID for itself, a CHP could use 
the HPID of its SHPs for any lawful 
purpose, including in the transactions. 
Self-insured group health plans are 
included in the definition of health plan 
in § 160.103. Because of this, self- 
insured group health plans will need to 
obtain a health plan identifier if they 
meet the definition of a CHP. We 
specifically mention self-insured group 
health plans as there was industry 
discussion about whether these health 
plans should be required to obtain 
HPIDs because they do not always need 
to be identified in the standard 
transactions. As discussed, the primary 
purpose of the HPID is for use in the 
standard transactions. Many self- 
insured group health plans contract 
with third party administrators or other 
entities to perform health plan functions 
on their behalf and those entities, not 
the self-insured group health plans, may 
be identified in the standard 
transactions. Some in the industry thus 
suggested not requiring self-insured 
group health plans to obtain HPIDs as 
they may not need to be identified in 
the standard transactions, while others 
recommended requiring these plans to 
obtain HPIDs as they may be the 
financially responsible party. Given that 
self-insured group health plans are 
included in the definition of health plan 
and there is a potential need to be 
identified in the standard transactions, 
we propose that they be required to 
obtain a HPID if they meet the definition 
of a CHP. We are soliciting comment on 
this issue. 
A SHP would be able to obtain an 
HPID even if its CHP does not obtain 
one on its behalf or does not direct the 
SHP to obtain an HPID. We encourage 
CHPs and SHPs to coordinate their 
HPID applications to prevent 
duplicative and unnecessary numbers. 
See Table 2 for a comparison of 
requirements for obtaining an HPID. 
TABLE 2—PROPOSED ENUMERATION REQUIREMENTS AND OPTIONS FOR CHPS AND SHPS 
Entity Enumeration requirements Enumeration options 
CHPs .................................... Must obtain an HPID for itself ......................................... May obtain an HPID(s) for its SHP(s). 
May direct its SHP(s) to obtain an HPID(s). 
SHPs .................................... Not required to obtain an HPID ...................................... May obtain an HPID at the direction of its CHP. 
May obtain an HPID on its own initiative. 
Using Illustration A and B, we 
provide examples of enumeration 
options to demonstrate the ways a CHP 
could choose to enumerate itself and its 
SHPs, if applicable. For these options, 
we are assuming that CHP ‘‘Z’’ and the 
SHPs Z–1, Z–2, Z–3, and Z–4 each 
meets the definition of health plan at 45 
CFR 160.103.

22959 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
(1) Illustration A. Enumeration Option 
1: CHP and Each SHP Obtain HPIDs 
CHP ‘‘Z’’ meets the definition of a 
health plan and controls its own 
business activities, actions, and policies. 
Therefore CHP ‘‘Z’’ would be required 
to obtain an HPID. CHP ‘‘Z’’ would then 
analyze its organizational structure and 
business needs to determine if and 
which of its SHPs need an HPID for use 
in standard transactions. CHP ‘‘Z’’ may 
determine that SHPs Z–1, Z–2, Z–3, and 
Z–4 each need their own HPID for use 
in the standard transactions as CHP ‘‘Z’’ 
and each of its SHPs may have separate 
data processing centers or arrangements. 
Thus, CHP ‘‘Z’’ would obtain an HPID, 
and each of the SHPs, from Z–1 to Z– 
4 would obtain their own HPIDs. SHPs 
could obtain HPIDs in one of two ways 
as described in the following scenarios: 
• Scenario 1—CHP ‘‘Z’’ obtains all 
the HPIDs. It obtains one HPID for itself 
and it obtains an HPID on behalf of each 
SHP. In total there are five HPIDs. 
• Scenario 2—CHP ‘‘Z’’ directs its 
SHPs to obtain HPIDs: CHP ‘‘Z’’ obtains 
its own HPID and each of the SHPs 
would obtain their own HPIDs 
individually. Ultimately, the result 
would be the same as scenario 1: The 
CHP and each of the four SHPs would 
have their own HPIDs and there would 
be a total of five HPIDs. 
Other possible scenarios would 
involve CHP ‘‘Z’’ obtaining fewer than 
all five HPIDs, or directing fewer than 
all four SHPs to obtain an HPID. Each 
of the SHPs may also decide on its own 
to obtain an HPID without direction 
from the CHP to do so. 
(2) Illustration A. Enumeration Option 
2: CHP Obtains HPID. SHPs Do Not 
Obtain HPIDs 
As in the first example, CHP ‘‘Z’’ 
would be required to obtain an HPID, as 
it meets the definition of health plan 
and controls its own business activities, 
actions, and policies. 
CHP ‘‘Z’’ may determine that none of 
its SHPs needs to be identified in 
standard transactions, and therefore 
none of the SHPs needs its own HPID. 
Instead, CHP ‘‘Z’’ may direct SHPs Z– 
1, Z–2, Z–3, and Z–4 to use the CHPs’ 
HPID in the standard transactions. 
(3) Illustration A. Enumeration Option 
3: CHP obtains HPID. Some, But Not All 
SHPs Obtain HPIDs 
Again, CHP ‘‘Z’’ would be required to 
obtain an HPID, as it meets the 
definition of health plan and controls its 
own business activities, actions, and 
policies. 
CHP ‘‘Z’’ may then examine its 
organizational structure to determine 
which of its SHPs need an HPID for use 
in a standard transaction. CHP ‘‘Z’’ may 
determine that SHPs Z–3 and Z–4 must 
be uniquely identified in the covered 
transaction because, for example, they 
do not share the same data processing 
centers as CHP ‘‘Z’’ and would each 
want to use their own HPID. SHPs Z– 
3 and Z–4 would use their own HPIDs 
in standard transactions. SHPs Z–3 and 
Z–4 could obtain their HPIDs in one of 
the following ways: 
• CHP ‘‘Z’’ could direct SHPs Z–3 
and Z–4 to obtain their own HPIDs. 
• CHP ‘‘Z’’ could obtain HPIDs on 
behalf of SHPs Z–3 and Z–4. CHP ‘‘Z’’ 
may determine that based on its 
organizational structure SHPs Z–1 and 
Z–2 do not need separate HPIDs for use 
in standard transactions as they may 
share data processing systems with CHP 
Z, SHP Z–3, or SHP Z–4. CHP ‘‘Z’’ may 
direct SHP Z–1 and Z–2 to use CHP 
‘‘Z’’’s HPID, SHP Z–3’s HPID, or SHP Z– 
4’s HPID in the transactions. CHP ‘‘Z’’ 
may make this determination based on 
the relevant data processing systems.

(4) Illustration B. Enumeration Option 1: 
CHP and Each SHP Obtain HPIDs 
Illustration B provides an example of 
a health plan being controlled by 
Company A, which is a holding 
company. Holding companies are 
examples of entities that control the 
business, activities, actions, or policies 
of other legal entities such as health 
plans, but typically do not meet the 
definition of a health plan as defined in 
45 CFR 160.103. Assuming Company A 
does not meet the definition of a ‘‘health 
plan’’ under the relevant definition in 
45 CFR 160.103, it would not be eligible 
to obtain an HPID. 
CHP ‘‘Z’’ meets the definition of 
health plan as found in 45 CFR 160.103, 
is controlled by an entity that is not a 
health plan, and exercises sufficient 
control over the subhealth plans to 
direct their business activities, actions, 
or policies. Therefore, it meets the 
definition of ‘‘controlling health plan’’ 
as proposed in 45 CFR 162.103, and 
would be required to obtain an HPID for 
itself. 
A similar analysis as discussed in 
Illustration A would need to be done to 
determine how subhealth plans Z–1, Z– 
2, Z–3, and Z–4 would be enumerated. 
CHP ‘‘Z’’ must examine its 
organizational structure to determine 
which of its SHPs need an HPID for use 
in standard transactions, and the same 
enumeration options for subhealth plans 
that existed for Illustration A would 
exist in this example. 
b. Examples of Use of HPID in Standard 
Transactions 
Within each transaction, a health plan 
may need to be identified in fields that 
do not specifically require the use of a 
health plan identifier. A health plan 
could need to be identified, for instance, 
in data fields that indicate the payer of 
the claim or the intended recipient of 
the transaction, or the information 
source for a particular request. To 
illustrate how the HPID could be used 
in standard transactions, we will look at 
a specific segment from one transaction 
standard. This example illustrates how 
covered entities would be required to 
identify a health plan in a standard 
transaction. This example is not meant 
to state who or what must be identified 
in the fields in the transaction, change 
what entities can be identified in 
specific loops or segments in the 
transaction standards, or affect the use 
of identifiers for non-health plans. It is 
important to note that the 
implementation of the HPID would not 
prohibit or affect the identification of 
other entities in these loops or segments 
if entities other than health plans need 
to be identified in those loops or 
segments. 
For this example, we will look at a 
specific segment from one transaction 
standard—the ASC X12 Version 5010 
health care eligibility benefit inquiry 
and response (also known as the 271). 
In this example, the segment is the 
NM1-Information Source Name in the 
2100A loop—Information Source. The 
standard provides the following 
definition of information source: ‘‘The 
information source is the entity that has 
the answer to the questions being asked 
in a 270 Eligibility or Benefit request 
transaction. The information source is 
typically the insurer or payer. In a 
managed care environment, the 
information source could possibly be a 
primary care physician or gateway 
health care provider. Regardless of the 
information source’s actual role in the 
healthcare system, they are the entity 
who maintains the information 
regarding the patient’s coverage.’’ The 
information source is identified in loop 
2100A. The NM1 segment, information 
source name, provides specific details 
about the information source through 
data elements. The NM1 segment is 
comprised of nine reference descriptors. 
These reference descriptors provide 
information about a specific data 
element. For instance, NM101—Entity 
ID Code—is the code identifying the 
organizational entity, a physical 
location, property or an individual. For 
NM101, there are specific codes that can 
be used to describe the information 
source. Table 3 represents the NM1 
segment. The chart is meant to 
demonstrate how the identification of a 
health plan in the NM1 segment will 
change after use of the HPID is 
mandated. For this example, the 
information source is the health plan. 
In Table 3, Column I, the reference 
descriptor provides the data element 
being described in the NM1 segment. 
Table 3, Column II provides the name of 
the reference descriptor in Table 3, 
Column I and describes what is being 
conveyed in that data element. Table 3, 
Column III lists the codes that the 
standard permits to be used to describe

HPID only (if a health 
plan is to be identified 
as the information 
source). 
Currently, if the health plan is the 
information source and needs to be 
identified in the transactions, it may be 
identified using a number of different 
identifiers as shown in Table 3, Column 
V. If this proposal is finalized and the 
HPID is adopted, and if a health plan is 
identified as the information source, it 
must be identified using an HPID as 
shown in Table 3, Column VI. 
As discussed earlier in this proposed 
rule, stakeholders at the NCVHS 
hearings expressed different viewpoints 
on the appropriate level of health plan 
enumeration. Some industry 
stakeholders encouraged health plan 
enumeration at a very high level (for 
example, at the level of the health plan’s 
legal entity), while other stakeholders 
supported enumeration at the benefit 
package level. We analyzed and 
considered these viewpoints when we 
developed the HPID policy proposed 
herein. 
We began by exploring the purpose of 
the HPID. While we considered multiple 
uses for the HPID, we determined that 
the primary purpose of the HPID is for 
use in standard transactions in order to 
identify health plans in the appropriate 
loops and segments and to provide a 
consistent standard identifier so a 
health plan no longer uses multiple 
identifiers in the HIPAA covered 
transactions. Therefore, we analyzed the 
transaction standards to determine the 
existing segments and loops where a 
health plan may need to be identified, 
what identifiers are currently used in 
those loops and segments to identify 
health plans, and what information that 
loop or segment is providing when a 
health plan is being identified. We also 
carefully considered the information 
that industry stakeholders reported was 
missing in covered transactions and 
suggested could be provided using a 
health plan identifier. We determined 
that much of the information testifiers 
wanted to obtain through the health 
plan identifier might already be 
available in other parts of the 
transaction standards and associated 
operating rules.

22962 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
3 Individual is defined at 45 CFR 160.103 as ‘‘the 
person who is the subject of protected health 
information.’’ 
(270/271) (hereinafter referred to as the 
Version 5010 270/271 eligibility 
inquiry/response standard), was 
adopted through an interim final rule 
with comment period published in the 
July 8, 2011 Federal Register (76 FR 
40458), with a compliance date of 
January 1, 2013. These operating rules 
require that more information be 
provided in the Version 5010 270/271 
eligibility inquiry/response standard, 
including information about a patient’s 
health plan name, coinsurance, 
copayment, and deductibles including 
in-network and out-of-network, as well 
as remaining deductible amounts. The 
loops, segments, and codes within the 
transaction standards are already 
available vehicles for providing this 
information today. Future versions of 
standards, as well as the adoption of 
operating rules to supplement the 
standards, can address many of the 
other issues raised by stakeholders and 
can continue to address issues or 
problems in the transactions as they 
arise. Therefore, we do not believe that 
the HPID needs to provide the level of 
detail that some testifiers suggested. 
In addition, requiring health plans to 
enumerate to a more granular level may 
prove burdensome to the industry as 
benefit package information and 
offerings change frequently and would 
require constant updates by health 
plans. Health care providers may also 
need to update their software and 
systems frequently to ensure the 
accuracy of information. This could 
result in increased time spent by health 
plan and health care provider staff to 
ensure appropriate information is being 
used for eligibility determination and 
claim payments. 
We developed the proposed HPID 
policy after considering stakeholder 
testimony, analyzing transaction 
standards’ loops and segments where 
the health plan identifier will be used, 
and taking into account newer versions 
of the standards and the adoption of 
operating rules to complement the 
standards. 
4. HPID Standard Format 
a. Introduction 
Per the NCVHS recommendations, 
which were based on stakeholder 
testimony from a wide range of potential 
HPID users, we propose to adopt an 
HPID that is a 10-digit, all-numeric 
identifier with a Luhn check-digit as the 
tenth digit. (See § 162.510). The Luhn 
check-digit is an algorithm used most 
often on credit cards as a check sum to 
validate that the card number issued is 
correct. See http:// 
www.merriampark.com/anatomycc.htm 
for more information. We seek public 
and stakeholder comments on the 
feasibility and utility of this format for 
the HPID. 
b. The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) Standard 
The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) is the world’s 
largest developer and publisher of 
international standards. National 
standards institutes from 160 nations 
comprise the ISO. The ISO has 
published more than 16,500 standards 
for numerous industries such as 
agriculture, electrical engineering, and 
other information technology industries. 
For more information on the ISO, refer 
to the Web site at http://www.iso.org. 
Based on stakeholder testimony, the 
NCVHS recommendations, and our 
review, we propose that the ISO 7812 
standard format, ISO/IEC 7812–1:2006 
and ISO/IEC 7812–2:2007, which 
consists of a 10-digit, all-numeric 
identifier with a Luhn check-digit as the 
tenth digit, be adopted as the standard 
for the HPID. This standard incorporates 
the same format that is used for the 
enumeration of health care providers via 
the National Provider Identifier (NPI), 
adopted in the NPI final rule, published 
in the January 23, 2004 Federal Register 
(69 FR 3434). Like the proposed 
standard for the HPID, the standard for 
the NPI is a 10-position all numeric 
identifier with a numeric check digit to 
assist in identifying erroneous or invalid 
NPIs. The HPID format would 
essentially be an intelligence-free 
identifier as the start digit of the number 
would provide the only piece of 
intelligence, signaling that the identifier 
had been provided to a health plan and 
not to an ‘‘other entity’’ or a health care 
provider. The OEID will have a different 
start digit than the HPID. The number of 
digits of the HPID would not exceed the 
number permitted for identifiers in the 
relevant data fields of the standard 
transactions. If additional capacity for 
HPIDs were needed in the future, the 
relevant data fields would permit 
additional numeric digits to be added at 
that time. Also, an all-numeric 
identifier: is more quickly and 
accurately keyed in data-entry 
applications; is more easily used in 
telephone keypad applications; does not 
require translation before application of 
the check digit algorithm and thus uses 
the full ability of the check digit 
algorithm to detect keying errors; will 
require less change for systems that 
currently use a numeric identifier; and 
is compatible with ISO identification 
card standards for a card issuer 
identifier, while Alphanumeric 
identifiers do not possess these 
important characteristics. 
B. Adoption of the Other Entity 
Identifier (OEID) 
In addition to proposing the adoption 
of an identifier for health plans, we are 
also proposing to adopt a data element 
in the form of an optional identifier for 
other entities for use in standard 
transactions, consistent with the 
recommendations of the NCVHS. 
Section 1104(c) of the Affordable Care 
Act provides in relevant part that the 
Secretary ‘‘shall promulgate a final rule 
to establish a unique health plan 
identifier (as described in section 
1173(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d– 
2(b))) based on the input of the National 
Committee on Vital and Health 
Statistics.’’ Section 1173(a)(1)(A) of the 
Act states in relevant part that ‘‘[t]he 
Secretary shall adopt standards for 
transactions, and data elements for such 
transactions, to enable health 
information to be exchanged 
electronically, that are appropriate for— 
(A) the financial and administrative 
transactions described in paragraph 
(2)* * *, ’’ which contains a list of the 
transactions for which the Secretary has 
to adopt a standard. 
The OEID would serve as an identifier 
for entities that are not health plans, 
health care providers, or ‘‘individuals’’,3 
yet they need to be identified in 
standard transactions. Under this 
proposed rule, these other entities 
would not be required to obtain an 
OEID, but they could obtain and use one 
if they needed to be identified in 
covered transactions. If they obtained an 
OEID, these entities would be expected 
to use it and disclose it upon request to 
entities that need to identify such 
entities for covered transactions. 
We are proposing to make obtaining 
and using the OEID voluntary. 
Stakeholders expressed a strong interest 
in being able to obtain an identifier, and 
the NCVHS agreed and recommended 
that such an identifier would be 
beneficial to the industry. We believe 
that voluntary obtaining and using is 
appropriate at this time, although we 
recognize that the OEID may be more 
beneficial if obtaining and using an 
OEID were required. We could do this, 
for example, by requiring health plans 
that have business relationships with 
other entities that perform certain 
functions on their behalf to direct in a 
contract or other arrangement these 
other entities to obtain and use an OEID. 
Alternatively, covered entities could on

their own initiative require their trading 
partners or business associates obtain 
OEIDs as part of their own agreed upon 
business arrangements. This rule does 
not propose to preclude such a business 
practice. We are interested in industry 
opinions about our proposal to make 
obtaining and using the OEID voluntary, 
and we also welcome comments about 
whether and how it should be made 
mandatory. 
1. The Other Entity Identifier (OEID) 
As discussed in section I. of this 
proposed rule, health plans often use 
the services of other entities to conduct 
certain financial and administrative 
transactions on their behalf. Rental 
networks, benefit managers, third party 
administrators, health care 
clearinghouses, repricers, and other 
third parties often perform functions 
similar to, or on behalf of, health plans. 
In many cases, these other entities are 
currently being identified in standard 
transactions in the same fields and 
using the same type of identifiers used 
by health plans. For example, when a 
covered health care provider conducts a 
transaction to determine eligibility for a 
health plan (referred to as an ‘‘eligibility 
for a health plan transaction’’), the 
health care provider may send an 
electronic request to obtain information 
about a patient’s eligibility for health 
care services to an entity referred to as 
an ‘‘information source.’’ This 
‘‘information source’’ provides 
information back to the health care 
provider about a specific patient’s 
health care coverage that a particular 
health plan provides. The ‘‘information 
source’’ for the patient’s eligibility 
information may be a health plan or one 
of these other entities that perform 
financial and administrative services on 
behalf of that health plan. Currently, in 
the transaction standard for the 
eligibility for a health plan transaction, 
health plans, and the other covered 
entities may use the same type of 
identifiers, such as a Payer Identifier 
(PAYERID) or an EIN, to identify 
themselves as the ‘‘information source.’’ 
In its September 30, 2010 letter to the 
Secretary, the NCVHS explained the 
integral role other entities play in health 
care administrative and financial 
electronic transactions. The NCVHS 
acknowledged that while these other 
entities may not meet the definition of 
‘‘health plan’’ under HIPAA, they 
nevertheless need to be identified in the 
transactions to ensure successful, 
efficient communication. The reality is 
that these entities often need to be 
identified in the same fields in which a 
health plan would need to be identified 
because they perform very similar 
functions. These other entities are using 
many of the same identifiers health 
plans currently use in covered 
transactions. In addition, the NCVHS 
recommended that HHS consider 
allowing these entities to obtain HPIDs 
as they may be the actual recipients of 
eligibility queries or claims on behalf of 
the health insurance issuer or the entity 
ultimately responsible for payment. The 
NCVHS stressed the importance of 
enabling these entities to be 
enumerated, and recommended that 
HHS consider making these entities 
eligible to obtain an HPID where there 
is a clear use case for them to be 
enumerated. Based on the testimony 
NCVHS heard, information we have 
received, and for the reasons stated 
previously, we believe that a clear use 
case does exist for these other entities to 
be enumerated. Moreover, we anticipate 
that with the recent advances in health 
information exchange and the 
development of health information 
networks, the need to identify these 
other entities in financial and 
administrative electronic transactions 
will only increase. 
Offering the OEID as an adopted data 
element to identify other entities that 
need to be identified in covered 
transactions should reduce costs and 
improve efficiency for covered entities. 
Because other entities are identified in 
the transaction standards in a similar 
manner as health plans, we believe that 
establishing a data element to serve as 
an identifier for these entities will 
increase efficiency by encouraging the 
use of a uniform identifier and promote 
compliant use of the HPID for health 
plans. Like the standard for HPID we are 
proposing to adopt, the OEID that we 
are proposing would follow ISO 
standard 7812, and be a 10-digit, all- 
numeric identifier with a Luhn check- 
digit as the tenth digit. Consequently, 
entities that have implemented the 
HPID and are seeking to implement the 
OEID would not need to significantly 
modify their information technology 
systems to accommodate the use of the 
OEID. 
Therefore, we are proposing to 
establish the OEID for use in standard 
transactions to identify entities that are 
not eligible to obtain an HPID or NPI 
and are not individuals (as defined at 45 
CFR 160.103). The OEID would be used 
to identify these other entities where 
these other entities need to be identified 
in the standard transactions, and for any 
other lawful purpose. These entities 
would be eligible, but not required, to 
obtain an OEID for themselves. An OEID 
would be obtained by the other entity 
from the Enumeration System identified 
in 45 CFR 162.508 as discussed in this 
proposed rule. Changes to its required 
data elements would need to be 
communicated to the Enumeration 
System within 30-days of the change. 
We solicit industry and stakeholder 
comments on our proposed enumeration 
of other entities and adoption of the 
OEID for use in the standard 
transactions. 
C. Assignment of the HPID and OEID 
1. The Enumeration System 
We propose that in 45 CFR 162.508, 
the Enumeration System would assign 
unique HPIDs and OEIDs to eligible 
health plans and eligible other entities, 
respectively. The Enumeration System 
would be a comprehensive system for 
uniquely identifying and enumerating 
all eligible health plans and other 
entities. It would collect and maintain 
certain identifying and administrative 
information about CHPs, SHPs, and 
other entities. The Enumeration System 
would also disseminate information 
through a publicly available searchable 
database or through downloadable files. 
Entities may also obtain a CHP’s or 
SHP’s HPID or an entity’s OEID by 
requesting the HPID from the health 
plan or the OEID from the other entity. 
HPIDs and OEIDs would only be 
assigned by the Enumeration System 
through an online application process. 
A health plan or other entity, when 
applying online for an HPID or OEID, 
would be required to provide certain 
identifying and administrative 
information. We anticipate this 
information will be used to verify the 
identity and eligibility of health plans 
and other entities during the application 
process. We anticipate further that a 
help desk will be available to assist 
health plans and other entities with the 
online application process as necessary 
and to notify health plans or other 
entities about problems associated with 
their online applications. 
The Enumeration System would also 
be able to deactivate or reactivate an 
HPID or OEID based on receipt of 
sufficient information. Examples of 
situations justifying deactivation of an 
HPID may include the fraudulent use of 
the HPID by the health plan itself or an 
other entity, the change of ownership of 
a health plan, or the restructuring of a 
health plan’s data processing systems 
such that the SHP determines that its 
HPID would no longer be needed. 
Deactivation of an OEID may also occur 
in similar situations, for example the 
fraudulent use of an OEID by itself or an 
other entity, the change of ownership of 
the other entity, or if the other entity no 
longer exists.

22964 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
Reactivation of an HPID or OEID 
could occur, for instance, if there were 
a change of ownership of a health plan 
or other entity, or for health plans if 
there were a restructuring of a health 
plan’s data processing systems and the 
SHP determines that it again needs its 
HPID. 
We solicit stakeholder comments on 
our proposals regarding the 
enumeration system and process. 
D. Other Considerations 
1. Pharmacy Transactions 
During the July 2010 NCVHS hearings 
on the health plan identifier, industry 
stakeholders also expressed views on 
the use of the HPID in retail pharmacy 
transactions. Currently, the pharmacy 
industry utilizes two unique identifiers 
in retail pharmacy transactions, the 
Bank Identification Number/Issue 
Identification Number (BIN/IIN) and the 
Processor Control Number (PCN). These 
identifiers are programmed into the 
pharmacy’s software and identify the 
route for processing the transaction from 
the pharmacy to the entity responsible 
for administering the claim, which 
could be the health plan or the 
pharmacy benefit manager. A pharmacy 
benefit manager is a third party 
administrator for prescription drug 
programs and is responsible for 
processing and paying claims on behalf 
of the health plan or drug plan sponsor. 
The BIN/IIN is a 6-digit number, 
requested by the pharmacies from either 
the American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) or the National Council 
for Prescription Drug Programs 
(NCPDP), for use by retail pharmacies to 
route prescription drug claims to the 
entity responsible for processing the 
transaction, usually the pharmacy 
benefit manager. The PCN is an 
identifier of up to 10 characters that is 
assigned by pharmacy benefit claim 
processors if there is a need to further 
define benefits and routing. For 
instance, the Medicare Part D 
prescription drug benefit plan 
Coordination of Benefits (COB) 
contractor has unique requirements for 
processing Medicare Part D claims. To 
accommodate those requirements, many 
administrators or processors have 
created PCNs to further differentiate the 
Medicare Part D prescription drug plan 
benefit COB business from their other 
(commercial or Medicaid) COB 
business. Both the BIN/IIN and PCN are 
embedded into pharmacies’ software 
programs, and identify the entity for 
processing claims. The identifiers are 
tied to the entity that will be processing 
the transaction, or where the transaction 
is to be sent. These identifiers are 
included in information from pharmacy 
benefit managers and/or health plans 
that are distributed to pharmacies to 
provide details on who will be 
processing the transaction, where to 
route the transaction and what rules are 
expected to be applied during 
transaction processing. The use of the 
BIN/IIN and PCN allow pharmacy 
claims to be adjudicated and responded 
to by the pharmacy benefit manager or 
health plan within seconds. According 
to the NCPDP, the use of these two 
identifiers has been very effective in 
ensuring efficient, timely prescription 
claim processing. Both pharmacy and 
non-pharmacy stakeholders testified at 
the July 2010 NCVHS Subcommittee on 
Standards hearings that the HPID, BIN/ 
IIN and PCN identifiers convey different 
information and serve different 
purposes. The BIN/IIN and PCN 
identifiers cannot provide the 
information needed about the health 
plan, nor can the information in the 
HPID provide the information inherent 
in the BIN/IIN and PCN identifiers. 
A representative of the retail 
pharmacy industry testified that if the 
health plan identifier were required to 
replace the BIN/IIN and/or PCN, such a 
change would be extremely costly to the 
retail pharmacy industry. For example, 
combination medical and/or 
prescription drug plan identification 
cards would need to be re-issued with 
the HPID, with no direct patient or 
pharmacy benefit. The NCPDP also 
noted that an HPID-only requirement 
would require a substantive change to 
the NCPDP D.0. In Version D.0, the Plan 
ID field is either not used or its use is 
optional, meaning its use was not 
intentionally defined in the standard. 
However, the use of the BIN and PCN 
fields is mandatory. 
In its September 30, 2010 
recommendation letter to the Secretary, 
the NCVHS observed that based on the 
testimony presented at the July 2010 
hearings, retail pharmacy transactions 
utilize the BIN/IIN and/or PCN 
identifier to facilitate their transaction 
processing and that changing to an other 
identifier would significantly affect 
existing data flows in the retail 
pharmacy industry that currently work 
effectively. As such, the pharmacy 
industry requested an exemption from 
the requirement to use only HPID in 
retail pharmacy transactions because of 
the current success with the BIN/IIN 
and PCN identifiers for routing 
purposes. The NCVHS recommended 
that use of the HPID in place of the 
existing BIN/IIN and PCN identifier in 
retail pharmacy business transactions 
not be required, but that the HPID be 
required on the HIPAA-named standard 
transactions for retail pharmacy. We are 
not proposing any changes to the 
NCPDP Version D.0 standard, and we do 
not believe that the HPID should be 
required in place of the existing BIN/IIN 
and PCN identifier in retail pharmacy 
transactions. 
2. Definition of Covered Health Care 
Provider 
We are proposing to move the 
definition of ‘‘covered health care 
provider’’ from 45 CFR 162.402 to 45 
CFR 162.103 because the term ‘‘covered 
health care provider’’ has a broader 
application beyond just Subpart D. 
E. Effective and Compliance Dates for 
the HPID 
In section 1104(c)(1) of the Affordable 
Care Act, Congress specified that ‘‘the 
Secretary shall establish a standard for 
a unique health plan identifier based on 
the input of the National Committee on 
Vital and Health Statistics.’’ Congress 
further provided that the rule shall be 
‘‘effective’’ not later than October 1, 
2012. Therefore, we are planning for the 
effective date of this rule to be October 
1, 2012. The effective date would mark 
the beginning of the implementation 
period for the HPID, which we expect 
would be the first day health plans may 
apply to obtain an HPID and the first 
day an entity may apply to obtain an 
OEID from the Enumeration System. We 
propose that the compliance date for all 
covered entities, except small health 
plans, to use the HPID in standard 
transactions be 2 years after the effective 
date of the final rule which, if the 
effective date is October 1, 2012 as we 
are planning, would be October 1, 2014. 
The compliance date for small health 
plans would be October 1, 2015. Small 
health plans would not be prohibited 
from complying earlier and using the 
HPID in their transactions at any time 
before October 1, 2015. 
The Congress uses the terms 
‘‘effective’’ and ‘‘adoption’’ in the 
Affordable Care Act as applied to both 
the rules that the Secretary must 
promulgate to adopt the various 
standards as well as to the standards 
themselves. In these provisions of the 
Affordable Care Act, Congress 
consistently uses the term ‘‘effective 
date’’ to mean the time when the 
relevant provision—either the rule or an 
adopted standard—must go into effect. 
In line with our previous 
interpretations, we have interpreted the 
‘‘effective date’’ of this rule to mean the 
date the Secretary adopts the HPID as 
the Unique Health Plan Identifier. In the 
NPI final rule, for instance, the effective 
date of the rule was the date the 
Secretary adopted a standard unique

health identifier for health care 
providers, and the compliance date 
marked the time by which an entity had 
to obtain and use an NPI in the standard 
transactions. We consequently interpret 
this section of the Act as specifying 
October 1, 2012 as the effective date of 
the final rule, when the policies take 
effect and the implementation period for 
the HPID begins. 
Understanding that Congress intended 
the effective date for the HPID final rule 
to be October 1, 2012, we note that this 
date marks the first day that a health 
plan will be able to apply to obtain an 
HPID. The 2-year implementation 
period for this new standard sets the 
date by which health plans (excluding 
small health plans) must obtain and 
covered entities (excluding small health 
plans) must use an HPID in the standard 
transactions as October 1, 2014. The 
compliance date for small health plans 
would be October 1, 2015. 
We are soliciting comment on the 
effective and compliance dates for the 
HPID. 
III. Proposed Addition to the National 
Provider Identifier Requirements 
A. Background 
As discussed in section I of this 
proposed rule, the final rule adopting 
the NPI as the standard unique health 
identifier for health care providers was 
published on January 23, 2004 (69 FR 
3434) (‘‘2004 NPI final rule’’). While the 
2004 NPI final rule requires covered 
health care providers to obtain NPIs for 
themselves and certain subparts and use 
them in standard transactions, it does 
not require a health care provider who 
is not a covered entity to obtain an NPI. 
Even if a noncovered health care 
provider chooses to obtain an NPI, the 
provider is not required to comply with 
certain NPI requirements, which means 
the provider does not have to disclose 
its NPI to entities who may need it for 
standard transactions. When a 
noncovered health care provider does 
not obtain an NPI or does not disclose 
it, certain problems arise for entities that 
need to identify that noncovered health 
care provider in standard transactions. 
We are proposing an addition to the 
requirements for the NPI regulations to 
address such problems. 
The 2004 NPI final rule (69 FR 3445) 
recognized that, ‘‘[s]ituations exist in 
which a standard transaction must 
identify a health care provider that is 
not a covered entity. * * * A 
noncovered health care provider may or 
may not have applied for and received 
an NPI. In the latter case, * * * an NPI 
would not be available for use in the 
standard transaction. We encourage 
every health care provider to apply for 
an NPI, and encourage all health care 
providers to disclose their NPIs to any 
entity that needs that health care 
provider’s NPI for use in a standard 
transaction. Obtaining NPIs and 
disclosing them to entities so they can 
be used by those entities in standard 
transactions will greatly enhance the 
efficiency of health care transactions 
throughout the health care industry. 
* * * The absence of NPIs when 
required in * * * claims by the 
implementation specifications may 
delay preparation or processing of those 
claims, or both. Therefore, we strongly 
encourage health care providers that 
need to be identified in standard 
transactions to obtain NPIs and make 
them available to entities that need to 
use them in those transactions.’’ 
The 2004 NPI final rule (69 FR 3445) 
provided the following example of a 
situation where a health care provider is 
not a covered entity but its NPI is 
needed for a standard transaction: ‘‘A 
pharmacy claim that is a standard 
transaction must include the identifier 
(which, as of the compliance date, 
would be the NPI) of the prescriber. 
Therefore, the pharmacy needs to know 
the NPI of the prescriber in order to 
submit the pharmacy claim. The 
prescriber may be a physician or other 
practitioner who does not conduct 
standard transactions. The prescriber is 
encouraged to obtain an NPI so it can be 
furnished to the pharmacy for the 
pharmacy to use on the standard 
pharmacy claim.’’ 
Within just a few months after 
implementation of the 2004 NPI final 
rule, this issue had been raised so 
frequently to HHS that, on September 
23, 2008, it published a Frequently 
Asked Question to address questions 
about pharmacy claims rejected by 
payers for lack of an individual 
prescriber NPI (Answer ID 9419) 
(https://questions.cms.hhs.gov/app/ 
answers/detail/a_id/9419/∼/does-the- 
national-provider-identifier-(npi)-final- 
rule-require-individual). 
Due to recurring issues, we believe 
this scenario described in the 2004 NPI 
final rule needs to be addressed. 
Pharmacies are encountering situations 
where the NPI of a prescribing health 
care provider needs to be included in 
the pharmacy claim, but the prescribing 
health care provider does not have an 
NPI or has not disclosed it. This 
situation has become particularly 
problematic in the Medicare Part D 
program, as we explain more fully later 
in this proposed rule. 
By way of background, every 
prescriber has at least one identifier that 
may be submitted on a pharmacy claim. 
These identifiers include the NPI, Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
number, uniform provider identification 
number (UPIN), or State license number. 
The Medicare Part D program is an 
optional prescription drug benefit for all 
Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Part D 
contracts with private companies, called 
plan sponsors, to administer the benefit 
through Part D drug plans. In the 
Medicare Part D program, plan sponsors 
must submit a prescription drug event 
(PDE) record to Medicare Part D every 
time a beneficiary’s prescription is filled 
under the program. Plan sponsors use 
information from the claim generated by 
the pharmacy to complete the PDE 
record, which contains summary 
information. These PDE records, which 
currently must contain a prescriber 
identifier are necessary to support 
accurate payments to plan sponsors by 
Medicare Part D. 
The use of multiple and invalid 
prescriber identifiers in the Medicare 
Part D program has been identified as a 
concern. In a June 2010 report titled, 
‘‘Invalid Prescriber Identifiers on 
Medicare Part D Drug Claims’’ (‘‘June 
2010 report’’), the HHS Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) reported the 
findings of its review of prescriber 
identifiers on 2007 Part D PDE records. 
The OIG reported finding 18.4 million 
PDE records that contained 527,749 
invalid identifiers, including invalid 
NPIs, DEA registration numbers, and 
UPINs. Payments by Part D drug plans 
and enrollees for prescriptions 
associated with these PDE records 
totaled $1.2 billion. Prescriber 
identifiers are valuable Part D program 
safeguards. These identifiers are the 
only data on Part D drug claims to 
represent that licensed practitioners 
have written prescriptions for Medicare 
enrollees. Although invalid prescriber 
identifiers are not an automatic 
indication of erroneous or fraudulent 
prescriptions or pharmacy claims, the 
lack of valid prescriber identifiers on 
Part D drug claims hampers Medicare’s 
program integrity efforts. 
To address these concerns raised by 
the June 2010 report, in the ‘‘Medicare 
Program; Changes to the Medicare 
Advantage and the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for 
Contract Year 2013 and Other Changes’’ 
final rule (which was filed for public 
inspection onApril 2, 2012 (hereinafter 
referred to as April 2012 final rule). 
CMS requires Part D sponsors to include 
an active and valid prescriber National 
Provider Identifier (NPI) on prescription 
drug event records (PDEs) that they 
submit to CMS, which will assist the 
Federal government in fighting possible 
fraudulent activity in the Part D

program, because prescribers will be 
consistently and uniformly identified. 
This policy will not interfere with 
beneficiary access to needed 
medications because Part D sponsors 
must validate the NPI at point of sale, 
and if this is not possible, permit the 
prescription to be dispensed and obtain 
the valid NPI afterwards.’’ 
Pharmacies that contract with Part D 
sponsors may be involved in obtaining 
a prescriber’s NPI depending on the 
agreement between the pharmacies and 
Part D sponsors. Because Part D 
sponsors and pharmacies generally have 
no regulatory leverage or other recourse 
over prescribers who fail or refuse to 
disclose NPIs, they must resort to using 
provider information databases to 
determine if a prescriber has an NPI or 
contact the prescriber, if known. If a 
Part D sponsor or network pharmacy is 
unable to obtain a prescriber NPI for use 
on the claim and PDE, the 
reimbursement from Medicare Part D to 
the sponsor (or alternatively, from the 
sponsor to the pharmacy depending on 
the agreement between the parties), 
could be negatively affected. We seek to 
address both current and future 
problems described previously that are 
presented by prescribers who do not 
have NPIs or do not disclose them, by 
proposing an additional requirement for 
the NPI regulations. 
B. Provisions for a Proposed 
Requirement To Obtain and Use NPIs 
We are proposing an additional 
requirement for organization covered 
health care providers that have as a 
member, employ, or contract with, an 
individual health care provider who is 
not a covered entity and is a prescriber. 
Organization health care providers are 
health care providers that are not 
individuals. Our proposal would require 
an organization to require such a 
prescriber to: (1) obtain an NPI; and (2) 
to the extent the prescriber writes a 
prescription while acting within the 
scope of the prescriber’s relationship 
with the organization, disclose the NPI 
upon request to any entity that needs it 
to identify the prescriber in a standard 
transaction. 
Organization covered health care 
providers would be required to 
implement the requirement within 180 
days after the effective date of the final 
rule, which would be reflected in 45 
CFR 162.404(a)(2) with regulation text 
stating that an organization covered 
health care provider must comply with 
the implementation specifications in 45 
CFR 162.410(b). We expect the final rule 
to be effective on October 1, 2012, in 
which case covered organization health 
care providers would have to meet the 
requirement by April 7, 2013. 
The requirement would be reflected 
in the regulation text in 45 CFR 
162.410(b) by adding the following new 
language. ‘‘An organization covered 
health care provider that has as a 
member, employs, or contracts with an 
individual health care provider who is 
not a covered entity and is a prescriber, 
must require such health care provider 
to: (1) obtain an NPI from the National 
Plan and Provider Enumeration System 
(NPPES) and (2) to the extent the 
prescriber writes a prescription while 
acting within the scope of the 
prescriber’s relationship with the 
organization, disclose the NPI upon 
request to any entity that needs it to 
identify the prescriber in a standard 
transaction.’’ 
This proposed requirement represents 
a narrow exception to the position we 
took in the 2004 NPI final rule. The 
2004 NPI final rule (69 FR 3440), we 
stated ‘‘[w]e do not consider individuals 
who are health care providers * * * 
and who are members or employees of 
an organization health care provider to 
be ‘‘subparts’’ of those organization 
health care providers, as described 
earlier in this section. Individuals who 
are health care providers are legal 
entities in their own right. The 
eligibility for an ‘‘Entity type code 1’’ 
NPI of an individual who is a health 
care provider and a member or an 
employee of an organization health care 
provider is not dependent on a decision 
by the organization health care provider 
as to whether or not an NPI should be 
obtained for, or by, that individual. The 
eligibility for an ‘‘Entity type code 1’’ 
NPI of a health care provider who is an 
individual is separate and apart from 
that individual’s membership or 
employment by an organization health 
care provider.’’ 
By virtue of this proposed rule, we are 
still not considering noncovered health 
care providers that are prescribers to be 
subparts of organization health care 
providers, nor are we proposing that 
they are not legal entities in their own 
right. Rather, our proposal would close 
a gap in the NPI rule by virtue of the 
relationships that covered organization 
health care providers have with 
noncovered individual health care 
providers. 
The providers we seek to reach are 
prescribers who are not required to 
obtain and disclose an individual NPI 
under the current NPI regulations. To 
the best of our understanding, these 
prescribers are largely hospital-based 
providers who staff clinics and 
emergency departments, or otherwise 
provide on-site medical services, such 
as medical residents and interns, as well 
as prescribers in group practices, whose 
services are billed under a group or 
‘‘Entity type code 2’’ NPI regardless of 
whether they have obtained an 
individual, or ‘‘Entity type code 1,’’ NPI. 
These prescribers are using the ‘‘Entity 
type code 2’’ to identify themselves on 
prescriptions, or an other or no 
identifier, which does not identify them 
as individuals. We believe this proposal 
describes the various relationships that 
organization health care providers have 
with such prescribers, and that the 
relationship is one in which 
organizations can exercise control over 
these prescribers and require them to do 
something. 
For instance, a physician or dentist 
who prescribes may be a member of a 
group practice. As noted in the 2004 
NPI final rule (69 FR 3439 and 3440), 
‘‘group health care providers are entities 
composed of one or more individuals 
(members), generally created to provide 
coverage of patients’ needs in terms of 
office hours, professional backup and 
support, or range of services resulting in 
specific billing or payment 
arrangements.’’ For purposes of this 
rule, we consider group health care 
providers to be organization health care 
providers.’’ By virtue of the contractual 
or other relationship between a group 
and a member, a group can require the 
member to do certain things, such as 
work certain on-call hours. Likewise, a 
resident or nurse practitioner who 
performs medical services at a hospital 
can be required to do certain things, 
such as to abide by medical staff by- 
laws and hospital policies and 
procedures, as a hospital employee or 
contractor. This proposed rule does not 
specify how organization covered health 
care providers should impose the 
requirement to obtain an NPI and 
disclose it on prescribers. Organization 
covered health care providers may have 
a number of alternatives by which they 
may accomplish this, for example, 
through a written agreement, an 
employment contract, or a directive to 
abide by the organization health care 
provider’s policies and procedures. 
The requirement for a prescriber to 
disclose his or her NPI would apply for 
prescriptions written pursuant to the 
prescriber’s relationship with the 
covered health care organization 
provider. For example, if a physician 
works for two group practices, A and B, 
group practice A would be required to 
require the physician to disclose his or 
her NPI for pharmacy claims that are for 
prescriptions written by the prescriber 
for a patient of group practice A, and 
group practice B would be required to 
do the same for pharmacy claims for

22967 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
prescriptions written by the prescriber 
for a patient of that group practice. 
We considered expanding our 
proposal to organization covered health 
care providers that grant clinical 
privileges to individual health care 
providers who are not covered entities 
and are prescribers, so that we would be 
certain to encompass hospital residents 
and interns under our proposal (to the 
extent they are not otherwise required to 
obtain Type 1 NPIs). However, it is our 
belief such prescribers will be 
encompassed under our proposal as 
drafted, as we further believe our 
proposal would encompass virtually all 
prescribers who are not currently 
required to obtain and disclose an 
individual NPI. Exceptions may 
include, by way of example, a self- 
employed physician who does not bill 
insurance plans and does not have a 
member, employee or contractual 
relationship with an organization 
covered health care provider (or has one 
with a noncovered organization health 
care provider), such as a psychiatrist or 
plastic surgeon who only accepts cash 
from patients. Even with respect to 
these prescribers, we hope this rule 
highlights the importance of voluntarily 
obtaining NPIs to facilitate their 
patients’ access to prescribed items. We 
seek comment regarding the extent to 
which residents, interns, and any other 
prescribers would not be reached under 
our proposal and any alternative 
approach that would encompass them. 
We believe this proposal furthers 
several goals and purposes identified in 
the Act. First, the statutory purpose of 
the Administrative Simplification 
provisions of HIPAA (see section 261 of 
the Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d note)) is, 
To improve the Medicare program under 
title XVIII of the Social Security Act, the 
Medicaid program under title XIX of such 
Act, and the efficiency and effectiveness of 
the health care system, by encouraging the 
development of a health information system 
through the establishment of uniform 
standards and requirements for the electronic 
transmission of certain health information 
and to reduce the clerical burden on patients, 
health care providers, and health plans. 
In accord with this statutory purpose, 
our proposal would improve the 
Medicare program by virtually ensuring 
the availability of an NPI as a prescriber 
identifier on pharmacy claims in the 
Part D program because virtually all 
prescribers would have to obtain an NPI 
and disclose it to entities that need it for 
use in standard transactions. That in 
turn would support program integrity 
efforts described in the April 2012 final 
rule noted previously which requires 
Part D sponsors to submit PDEs that 
contain only individual NPIs as 
prescriber identifiers, effective January 
1, 2013. As noted in the April 2012 final 
rule, ‘‘[w]hen multiple prescriber 
identifiers, not to mention dummy or 
invalid identifiers, are used, authorities 
must take an additional step in their 
data analysis before even achieving a 
refined data set to use for further 
analysis to identify possible fraud. For 
example, having to cross-reference 
multiple databases that update on 
different schedules to be certain of the 
precise prescribers involved when 
multiple identifiers were used, would 
necessitate several additional steps of 
data pre-analysis and also would 
introduce potential errors in correctly 
matching prescribers among databases.’’ 
Invalid identifiers are generally those 
that do not appear as current in any 
prescriber identifier registry. Dummy or 
default identifiers have never appeared 
in any prescriber identifier registry but 
have been used successfully on 
pharmacy claims in place of valid 
prescriber identifiers (for instance, 
when the prescriber’s NPI was not 
available), because they met the length 
and format requirements of a prescriber 
identifier. Default identifiers present 
additional challenges to authorities, 
since the actual prescription must be 
researched to identify the prescriber. 
Valid prescriber identifiers are essential 
to conducting claims analyses to 
identify aberrant claims prescribing 
patterns that may indicate fraudulent 
activity, such as drug diversion schemes 
or billing for prescription drugs not 
provided, which includes circumstances 
with active prescriber participation and 
those involving forged prescriptions. 
Improving the accuracy and 
dependability of the prescriber 
identifier on Part D claims and PDEs, 
improves the ability to identify fraud 
and, in turn, protects and improves the 
Medicare program. 
This proposal would further improve 
the Medicare program by nearly 
eliminating the instances in which Part 
D sponsors’ reimbursement (or possibly 
their network pharmacies’ 
reimbursement, depending on the 
contractual relationship between the 
sponsors and the pharmacies) would be 
negatively impacted due to the actions 
of prescribers with whom they may 
have no business relationship. Part D 
sponsors would be expected to price 
any measurable expectation of financial 
risk, if any, due to nonreimbursement 
by CMS into their Part D bids, thus 
possibly increasing premiums and 
subsidies paid under the program. This 
proposal would make such action by 
Part D sponsors unnecessary by 
virtually ensuring the availability of 
prescriber NPIs. 
This proposal also accords with the 
purpose of HIPAA as amended by the 
Affordable Care Act. Section 1104(a)(2) 
of the Affordable Care Act revised the 
statutory purpose of HIPAA 
Administrative Simplification by 
adding, at the end, that its purpose is to 
‘‘reduce the clerical burden on patients, 
health care providers, and health 
plans.’’ To the extent pharmacies only 
have to accept one identifier—the NPI— 
rather than four possible identifiers 
from prescribers for the majority of their 
claims, the administrative burden on all 
parties involved in the processing and 
payment of these claims would be 
lessened. Pharmacies and payers would 
no longer have to cross-check provider 
identifier databases to determine if the 
prescriber had an NPI when an alternate 
identifier was used, or contact the 
prescriber. Moreover, pharmacies and 
prescribers would no longer have to 
respond to inquiries from payers 
regarding the existence of an NPI when 
an alternate prescriber identifier was 
used. 
The proposal is also supported by 
section 1173(a)(3) of the Act, which 
requires the transaction standards 
adopted by the Secretary to 
accommodate the needs of different 
types of health care providers. Our 
proposal would accommodate the needs 
of pharmacies, a type of health care 
provider, by ensuring that a prescriber 
NPI is available to them when needed 
for their claims and reducing the 
instances in which they must cross- 
reference provider information 
databases or research a prescription. 
Similarly, section 1173(b)(1) of the Act 
states that, 
[t]he Secretary shall adopt standards 
providing for a standard unique health 
identifier for each individual, employer, 
health plan, and health care provider for use 
in the health care system. In carrying out 
[this requirement] for each health plan and 
health care provider, the Secretary shall take 
into account multiple uses for identifiers and 
multiple locations and specialty 
classifications for health care providers. 
Our proposal takes into account the 
particular needs of pharmacies by 
addressing a problem they have under 
HIPAA. 
While some prescribers will have to 
apply to obtain an NPI under this 
proposed requirement, the NPI is free of 
charge and requires only the completion 
of a three-page application form that 
seeks primarily identifying and location 
information. Thus, we believe the 
reduction in administrative burden that 
will be achieved by our proposal 
outweighs the minimal burden placed 
on prescribers who will have to obtain 
NPIs.

22968 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
The 2004 NPI final rule, as noted 
previously, foretold the issues that 
could arise if noncovered health care 
providers did not obtain NPIs, and 
therefore encouraged them to do so. The 
preamble of the 2004 NPI final rule 
stated that disclosing NPIs to entities for 
use in standard transactions will greatly 
enhance the efficiency of health care 
transactions throughout the health care 
industry, and that the absence of NPIs 
when required in those claims by the 
implementation specifications may 
delay preparation or processing of those 
claims, or both. Health care providers 
responded by obtaining NPIs in large 
numbers even when not required to, and 
we believe the vast majority of 
prescribers already have NPIs. CMS data 
shows that approximately 90 percent of 
Medicare Part D claims as reported in 
PDEs currently submitted contain valid 
prescriber NPIs even though alternate 
prescriber IDs are permitted at this time. 
But, while the vast majority of Medicare 
Part D claims contain individual NPIs, 
10 percent do not. This proposal would 
help ensure this last 10 percent is 
addressed. After discussions with 
representatives of the provider data 
industry, we estimate there are 
approximately 1.4 million active 
prescribers in the United States, of 
which approximately 160,000 do not 
have an NPI. It is these prescribers who 
would have to obtain an NPI if this rule 
is finalized as proposed. 
C. Effective and Compliance Dates 
We propose that the date by which an 
organization covered health care 
provider must comply is 180 days after 
the effective date of the final rule. In 
other words, if the final rule is effective 
on October 1, 2012, then by April 7, 
2013, organization covered health care 
providers that have a prescriber as a 
member, employ, or contract with a 
prescriber who is not a covered entity, 
must require him or her to (1) obtain an 
NPI and; (2) to the extent the prescriber 
writes a prescription while acting 
within the scope of the prescriber’s 
relationship with the organization, to 
disclose the NPI upon request to any 
entity that needs it to identify the 
prescriber in a standard transaction. 
IV. Proposed Change to the Compliance 
Date for ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
A. Background 
As discussed in section I. of this 
proposed rule, the final rule adopting 
ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
(collectively, ‘‘ICD–10’’) as HIPAA 
standard medical data code sets was 
published in the Federal Register on 
January 16, 2009 (74 FR 3328) (the 
‘‘ICD–10 final rule’’). The ICD–10 final 
rule requires covered entities to use 
ICD–10 beginning October 1, 2013. 
In late 2011 and early 2012, three 
issues emerged that led the Secretary to 
reconsider the compliance date for ICD– 
10: (1) The industry transition to 
Version 5010 did not proceed as 
effectively as expected; (2) providers 
expressed concern that other statutory 
initiatives are stretching their resources; 
and (3) surveys and polls indicated a 
lack of readiness for the ICD–10 
transition. 
1. The Transition to Version 5010 and 
Its Effect on ICD–10 Readiness 
Concurrent with the publication of 
the ICD–10 final rule, HHS published in 
the Federal Register the Modifications 
final rule which set January 1, 2012 as 
the compliance date for Version 5010 
(74 FR 3296). As the industry 
approached the January 1, 2012 Version 
5010 compliance date, a number of 
implementation problems emerged, 
some of which were unexpected. These 
included— 
• Trading partners were not ready to 
test the Version 5010 standards due to 
vendor delays in delivering and 
installing Version 5010-compliant 
software to their provider clients; 
• Version 5010 errata were issued to 
correct typographical mistakes and 
other maintenance issues that were 
discovered as the industry began its 
internal testing of the standards, which 
delayed vendor delivery of compliant 
products and external testing; 
• Differences between address 
requirements in the ‘‘provider billing 
address’’ and ‘‘pay to’’ address fields 
adversely affected crossover claims 
processing; 
• Inconsistent payer interpretation of 
standard requirements at the front ends 
of systems resulted in rejection of 
claims, as well as other technical and 
standard misinterpretation issues; 
• Edits made in test mode that were 
later changed when claims went into 
production without adequate notice of 
the change to claim submitters; and 
• Insufficient end to end testing with 
the full scope of edits and business rules 
in place to ensure a smooth transition to 
full production. 
Given concerns that industry would 
not be compliant with the Version 5010 
standards by the January 1, 2012 
compliance date, we announced on 
November 17, 2011 that we would not 
initiate any enforcement action against 
any covered entity that was not in 
compliance with Version 5010 until 
March 31, 2012, to enable industry 
adequate time to complete its testing 
and software installation activities. On 
March 15, 2012, this date was extended 
an additional 3 months, until June 30, 
2012. 
The ICD–10 final rule set October 1, 
2013 as the compliance date, citing 
industry testimony presented to NCVHS 
and many of the over 3,000 industry 
comments received on the ICD–10 
proposed rule. The analysis in the ICD– 
10 final rule with regard to setting a 
compliance date emphasized the 
interdependency between 
implementation of ICD–10 and Version 
5010, and the need to balance the 
benefits of ICD–10 with the need to 
ensure adequate time for preparation 
and testing before implementation. As 
noted in the ICD–10 final rule, ‘‘[w]e 
cannot consider a compliance date for 
ICD–10 without considering the 
dependencies between implementing 
Version 5010 and ICD–10. We recognize 
that any delay in attaining compliance 
with Version 5010 would negatively 
impact ICD–10 implementation and 
compliance.’’ (74 FR 3334) Based on 
NCVHS recommendations and industry 
feedback received on the proposed rule, 
we determined that ‘‘24 months (2 
years) is the minimum amount of time 
that the industry needs to achieve 
compliance with ICD–10 once Version 
5010 has moved into external (Level 2) 
testing.’’ (74 FR 3334) In the ICD–10 
final rule, we concluded that the 
October 2013 date provided the industry 
adequate time to change and test 
systems given the 5010 compliance date 
of January 1, 2012. 
As implementation of ICD–10 is 
predicated on the successful transition 
of industry to Version 5010, we are 
concerned that the delays encountered 
in Version 5010 have affected ICD–10 
planning and transition timelines. 
2. Providers have Expressed Concern 
That Other Statutory Initiatives Are 
Stretching Their Resources 
Since publication of the ICD–10 and 
Modifications final rules, a number of 
other statutory initiatives were enacted, 
requiring health care provider 
compliance and reporting. Providers are 
concerned about their ability to expend 
limited resources to implement and 
participate in the following initiatives 
that all have similar compliance 
timeframes. 
The EHR Incentive Program was 
established under the Health 
Information Technology for Economic 
and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, a 
part of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111– 
5). Medicare and Medicaid incentive 
payments are available to eligible 
professionals and hospitals for adopting 
electronic health record (EHR)

Providers, payers, and Vendors for the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),’’ December, 
2011, Prepared by CMS. Survey responses received 
from 404 health care providers, 101 payers, and 90

6 An impact assessment for ICD–10 is performed 
by a covered entity to determine business areas, 
policies, processes and systems, and trading 
partners that will be affected by the transition to 
ICD–10. An impact assessment is a tool to aid in 
planning for implementation. 
7 For providers, the CMS ICD–10 Implementation 
Guide recommends that they complete their impact 
assessments by Winter 2012 and begin external 
testing in the Fall of 2012. CMS provides 
implementation guides for providers, payers, and 
vendors to assist with the transition from ICD–9 to 
ICD–10 codes. It is a resource for covered entities 
providing detailed information for planning and 
executing the ICD–10 transition process. CMS 
recommends industry use the guide as a reference. 
technology and demonstrating 
meaningful use of such technology. 
Eligible professionals and hospitals that 
fail to meaningfully use EHR technology 
could be subject to Medicare payment 
adjustments beginning in FY 2015. The 
Physician Quality Reporting System is a 
voluntary reporting program that 
provides incentives payments to eligible 
professionals and group practices that 
satisfactorily report data on quality 
measures for covered Physician Fee 
Schedule services furnished to Medicare 
Part B Fee-for-Service beneficiaries. The 
eRx Incentive Program is a reporting 
program that uses a combination of 
incentive payments and payment 
adjustments to encourage electronic 
prescribing by eligible professionals. 
Beginning in 2012 through 2014, 
eligible professionals who are not 
successful electronic prescribers are 
subject to a payment adjustment. 
Finally, section 1104 of the Affordable 
Care Act imposes additional HIPAA 
Administrative Simplification 
requirements on covered entities, shown 
in Chart 1.

3. Current State of Industry Readiness 
for ICD–10 
It is crucial that all segments of the 
health care industry transition to ICD– 
10 at the same time because the failure 
of any one industry segment to 
successfully implement ICD–10 has the 
potential to affect all other industry 
segments. Ultimately, such failure could 
result in returned claims and provider 
payment delays that disrupt provider 
operations and negatively impact 
patient access to care. 
In early 2012, it became evident that 
sectors of the health care industry 
would not be prepared for the October 
1, 2013 ICD–10 compliance date. 
Providers in particular voiced concerns 
about their ability to meet the ICD–10 
compliance date as a result of a number 
of factors, including obstacles they 
experienced in transitioning to Version 
5010 and the other initiatives that 
stretch their resources. A CMS survey 
conducted in November and December 
2011 (hereinafter referred to as the CMS 
readiness survey) found that 26 percent 
of providers surveyed indicated that 
they are at risk for not meeting the 
October 1, 2013 compliance date.4 
In February 2012, the Workgroup for 
Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) 
conducted a survey on ICD–10 
readiness, hereinafter referred to as the 
WEDI readiness survey.5 WEDI received 
responses from more than 2,600 
providers, health plans, and vendors 
showing that the industry is uncertain 
about its ability to meet ICD–10 
compliance milestones. Data from the 
WEDI survey indicated that nearly 50 
percent of the provider respondents did 
not know when they would complete 
their impact assessment.6 In addition, 
the survey found that approximately 33 
percent of providers did not expect to 
begin external testing in 2013, while 
approximately 50 percent of providers 
did not know when testing would 
occur.7 
Other segments of the industry, such 
as health plans and software vendors, 
also reported that they would benefit 
from additional time for 
implementation. While the CMS ICD–10 
Implementation Guide recommends that 
payers begin external testing in the fall 
of 2012, the WEDI readiness survey 
found that most health plans do not 
expect to begin external testing until 
2013. In addition, about 50 percent of 
vendors are not yet halfway through 
development of ICD–10 products. 
Vendor delays in product development 
can result in provider and payer delays 
in implementing ICD–10. 
Given the evidence that segments of 
the health care industry will likely not 
meet the October 1, 2013 compliance 
date, the reasons for that likelihood, and 
the likelihood that a compliance date 
delay would significantly improve the 
successful and concurrent 
implementation of ICD–10 across the 
health care industry, we are proposing 
to extend the compliance date for ICD– 
10. 
B. One-Year Delay 
We are proposing to extend the 
compliance date for ICD–10 for 1 year, 
from October 1, 2013 to October 1, 2014. 
This change would be reflected in the 
regulations at 45 CFR 162.1002. While 
we considered a number of alternatives 
for the delay, as discussed in the Impact 
Analysis of this proposed rule, we 
believe a 1-year delay would provide 
sufficient time for small providers and 
small hospitals to become ICD–10 
compliant and would be the least 
financially burdensome to those who 
had planned to be compliant on October 
1, 2013. 
To determine the new compliance 
date for ICD–10, we balanced the need 
for additional time for small providers 
and small hospitals to become 
compliant with the financial burden of

9 ‘‘Survey: Industry Reaction to Potential Delay of 
ICD–10—A Delay will be Costly, but Manageable 
* * * Unless it’s more than a Year,’’ February 27, 
2012, conducted by Edifecs. The survey’s 
participants included commercial payers (25%), 
Blue Cross Blue Shield plans (25%), healthcare 
providers (18%), government entities such as State 
Medicaids (9%), medical claim clearinghouses 
(6%), and other healthcare industry organizations 
(17%). 
10 Edifecs poll, 2012. 
11 Letter to Kathleen G. Sebelius, Secretary, U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, from 
the National Committee of Vital and Health 
Statistics (NCVHS), ‘‘Possible Delay of Deadline for 
Implementation of ICD–10 Code Sets,’’ March 2, 
2012. 
a delay on entities that have developed 
budgets and planned process and 
system changes around the October 1, 
2013 compliance date. Entities that have 
started planning and working toward an 
October 1, 2013 implementation would 
incur costs by having to reassess and 
adjust implementation plans and 
maintain contracts to manage the 
transition beyond October 1, 2013. We 
concluded that a 1-year delay would 
strike a reasonable balance by providing 
sufficient time for small providers and 
small hospitals to become compliant 
and would minimize the financial 
burden on those entities that have been 
actively planning and working toward 
being compliant on October 1, 2013. 
Data from two surveys helped us in 
our determination to propose 1 
additional year for compliance. First, 
the CMS readiness survey revealed that 
26 percent of providers reported that 
they are at risk for non-compliance on 
October 1, 2013, citing insufficient time 
as one risk factor.8 Second, an informal 
survey conducted by Edifecs, a health 
care IT company, of 50 senior health 
care officials representing a wide range 
of organizations found that thirty-seven 
percent of respondents stated that a 1- 
year delay would be beneficial to them.9 
While we considered a 2-year delay, 
we determined that the financial burden 
could be too significant for those 
entities that would otherwise be ready 
on October 1, 2013. As discussed further 
in the Impact Analysis of this proposed 
rule, we estimate it will cost health 
plans up to an additional 30 percent of 
their current ICD–10 implementation 
budgets for a 1-year delay and therefore, 
we assume that a 2-year delay would be 
at least double the cost of a 1-year delay; 
that is, a 2-year delay would cost at least 
$13 billion for all commercial and 
government health plans. In addition to 
financial concerns, industry has 
suggested that a 2-year delay may stop 
the implementation of ICD–10 
completely. The Edifecs poll found that 
nearly 70 percent of respondents believe 
that a 2-year delay would be either 
‘‘potentially catastrophic or cause an 
unrecoverable failure,’’ and that ‘‘a 
delay of longer than a year will likely 
freeze budgets, slow down schedules, or 
stop work altogether.’’ 10 Only 2 percent 
of Edifecs respondents said there would 
be a benefit to a 2-year delay. 
Finally, in its March 2, 2012 letter to 
the Secretary on a possible delay of the 
ICD–10 compliance date, the NCVHS 
urged that any delay should be 
announced as soon as possible and 
should not be for more than 1 year. The 
NCVH made this recommendation in 
consideration of its belief that a delay 
would cause a significant financial 
burden ‘‘that accrues with each month 
of delay.’’ 11 
We believe that a 1-year delay would 
benefit all covered entities, even those 
who had are actively planning and 
striving for a 2013 implementation. A 1- 
year delay would enable the industry as 
a whole to test more robustly and 
implement simultaneously, which 
would foster a smoother and more 
coordinated transition to ensure the 
continued and uninterrupted flow of 
health care claims and payment. 
Therefore, we are proposing that 
covered entities must comply with ICD– 
10 on October 1, 2014. 
V. Collection of Information 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA), agencies are required to 
provide a 60-day notice in the Federal 
Register and solicit public comment on 
a collection of information requirement 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. In order to fairly evaluate 
whether an information collection 
should be approved by OMB, section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA requires that 
we solicit comment on the following 
issues: 
• Whether the information collection 
is necessary and useful to carry out the 
proper functions of the agency. 
• The accuracy of the agency’s 
estimate of the information collection 
burden. 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected. 
• Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
A. Information Collection Requirements 
(ICRs) Regarding HPID/OEID on Health 
Plan and Other Entities (§ 162.512 and 
§ 162.514) 
In order to apply for an HPID or OEID, 
there is an initial one-time requirement 
for information from health plans that 
seek to obtain an HPID and other 
entities that elect to obtain an OEID. In 
addition, health plans and other entities 
may need to provide updates to 
information. 
With respect to the collection of 
information requirements for the HPID, 
it is important to bear in mind that: (1) 
Systems modifications necessary to 
implement the HPID/OEID may overlap 
with the other systems modifications 
needed to implement other Affordable 
Care Act standards; (2) some 
modifications may be made by 
contractors such as practice 
management vendors, in a single effort 
for a multitude of affected entities; and 
(3) identifier fields are already in place 
and HPID/OEID will, in many instances, 
simply replace the multiple identifiers 
currently in use. 
Under this proposed rule, a CHP, as 
defined in 45 CFR 162.103, will have to 
obtain an HPID from a centralized 
electronic Enumeration System. A SHP, 
as defined in 45 CFR 162.103, would be 
eligible but not required to obtain an 
HPID. If a SHP obtains an HPID, it 
would apply either directly to the 
Enumeration System or its CHP would 
apply to the Enumeration System on its 
behalf. Other entities may apply to 
obtain an OEID from the Enumeration 
System. Health plans that obtain an 
HPID and other entities that obtain an 
OEID would have to communicate any 
changes to their information to the 
Enumeration System within 30 days of 
the change. A covered entity must use 
an HPID to identify a health plan in a 
standard transaction. 
We estimate that there will be up to 
15,000 entities that will be required to, 
or will elect to, obtain an HPID or OEID. 
We based this number on the following 
data in Chart 2.

Rulemaking http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/
FR-2011-08-22/pdf/2011-21193.pdf. 
Note that the number of health plans 
that will be required, or have the option, 
to obtain an HPID is considerably larger 
than the number of health plans for 
which we used in the calculations in 
section V. of this proposed rule. This is 
because self-insured health plans are 
required to obtain HPIDs if they meet 
the requirements of a Controlling health 
plan under this proposed rule. However, 
we assume that very few self-insured 
group health plans conduct standard 
transactions themselves; rather, they 
typically contract with TPAs or 
insurance issuers to administer the 
plans. Therefore, there will be 
significantly fewer health plans that use 
HPIDs in standard transactions than 
health plans that are required to obtain 
HPIDs, and only health plans that use 
the HPIDs in standard transactions will 
have direct costs and benefits. 
To comply with these requirements, 
health plans and other entities will 
complete the appropriate application/ 
update form online through the 
Enumeration System. This online form 
serves two purposes: applying for an 
identifier and updating information in 
the Enumeration System. 
Most health plans and other entities 
will not have to furnish updates in a 
given year. However, lacking any 
available data on rate of change, we 
elected to base our assumptions on 
information in the Medicare program 
that approximately 12.6 percent of 
health care providers provide updates in 
a calendar year. We anticipate this 
figure would be on the high end for 
health plans and other entities. 
Applying this assumption, we can 
expect that 1,764 health plans will need 
to complete and submit the HPID 
application update form in a given year. 
Applying for HPID or OEID is a one- 
time burden. In future years, this burden 
would apply only to new health plans 
and as an option for other entities as 
described in the section V of this 
proposed rule. From 2013 to 2018, 
industry trends indicate that the number 
of health plans will remain constant, or 
even decrease.12 We assume that the 
number of new health plans will be 
small, and that the costs will be 
negligible. Therefore, our calculations 
reflect that there will be no statistically 
significant growth in the number of 
health plans or other entities and we 
calculate zero growth in new 
applications. 
We estimate it will take 30 minutes to 
complete the application form and use 
an hourly labor rate of approximately 
$23/hour, the average wage reported for 
professional and business and services 
sector, based on data from the 
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, June 2011, ‘‘Average hourly 
and weekly earnings of production and 
nonsupervisory employees (1) on 
private nonfarm payrolls.’’ (ftp://
ftp.bls.gov/pub/suppl/empsit.ceseeb11.
txt). This represents a unit cost of 
$11.50 per application for both HPID 
and OEID. 
Because our initial estimate for the 
number of applications for OEID is 
small (162 Clearinghouses and 
Transaction Vendors + 750 TPAs = 912) 
and the costs negligible, we do not 
include separate calculations. We have 
elected instead to offer the unit cost 
figure as a baseline if commenters 
demonstrate that the universe of 
applications for OEID is likely to 
expand significantly. 
To further reduce burden and plan for 
compliance with the Government 
Paperwork Elimination Act, we propose 
accepting electronic applications and 
updates over the internet. We explicitly 
solicit comment on how we might 
conduct this activity in the most 
efficient and effective manner, while 
ensuring the integrity, authenticity, 
privacy, and security of health plan and 
other entity information. 
B. ICRs Regarding Implementation 
Specifications: Health Care Providers 
(§ 162.410) 
We are proposing to put an additional 
requirement on covered organization 
health care providers that employ, have 
as members, or have contracts with 
individual health care providers who 
are not covered entities but who are 
prescribers. By 180 days after the 
effective date of the final rule, such 
organizations must require such health 
care providers: (1) To obtain, by 
application if necessary, an NPI from 
the National Plan and Provider 
Enumeration System (NPPES); (2) to the 
extent the prescriber writes a 
prescription while acting within the 
scope of the prescriber’s relationship 
with the organization, disclose his or 
her NPI, upon request to any entity that 
needs the NPI to identify the prescriber 
in a standard transaction. 
The burden associated with the 
addition to the requirements of 
§ 162.410 as discussed in this proposed 
rule is the one-time application burden, 
and later update burden as necessary, 
on prescribers who do not already have 
an NPI, who have a relationship with a 
covered health care provider, and who 
must be identified in a standard 
transaction. We estimate that there are 
approximately 1.4 million prescribers in 
the United States, of which 
approximately 160,000 do not have an 
NPI. It is these prescribers who would 
have to obtain an NPI if this rule is 
finalized as proposed. Based on the 
estimations in the NPI final rule, we 
estimate that it will take 20 minutes to 
complete an application for an NPI and 
use an hourly labor rate of 
approximately $23/hour, the average 
wage reported for professional and 
business and services sector, based on 
data from the Department of Labor, 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 2011, 
‘‘Average hourly and weekly earnings of 
production and nonsupervisory 
employees (1) on private nonfarm 
payrolls.’’ (ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/suppl/
empsit.ceseeb11.txt). Additionally, we 
have calculated an increase of 3 percent 
for labor costs for each of the years 2013 
through 2016 for an hour rate of 
approximately $24/hour for year 2013. 
Table 4 shows the estimated 
annualized burden for the HPID and NPI 
PRA in hours.

VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Need for Regulatory Action 
1. NPI for Non-Covered Health Care 
Providers 
The compliance date for use of the 
NPI by health care providers was May 
23, 2007. At this point, we believe there 
are 160,000 health care providers who 
do not already have an NPI. For these 
health care providers, obtaining an NPI 
is not a burdensome endeavor, as it is 
free of charge and takes approximately 
20 minutes to file an application to 
obtain one. However, the availability of 
these additional prescriber NPIs will 
greatly assist entities who need them for 
use in standard transactions, including 
for the Medicare Part D program, as 
described previously. See section V.B. 
of this proposed specifically for a 
summary of the time costs associated 
with obtaining an NPI. We have 
included the costs associated with 
obtaining an NPI detailed in section V.B 
in the summary Tables 32 and 33 of the 
RIA. Because there are few health care 
providers who do not already have an 
NPI, we estimate that the addition to the 
NPI requirements will have little impact 
on health care providers and on the 
health industry at large. We solicit 
comment on this. 
2. HPID 
As noted in section I of this proposed 
rule, health plans and other payers are 
identified in a number of different ways 
in covered transactions by the health 
care industry. Health plan identifiers are 
currently used to facilitate routing of 
covered transactions or, in other words, 
‘‘to determine either where the standard 
electronic transactions are to be sent if 
the receiver is [a] health plan or from 
where they came from if the sender is 
a health plan.’’13 The primary function 
of the HPID proposed in this rule is to 
create a standard data element for 
covered entities to identify health plans 
in HIPAA covered transactions. 
Different segments in each HIPAA 
standard transaction require an 
identifier to identify the payer or 
sender/recipient of a particular 
transaction. (See Table 1 for a list of 
HIPAA standard transactions, and Table 
3 for an example of a segment that 
requires a payer identifier.) Currently, 
when a covered entity, for business 
reasons, inputs an identifier that 
identifies a health plan into a 
transaction segment, the identifier is 
proprietary or based on the NAIC code, 
EIN, or TIN of the health plan or other 
entity. Some health plans use multiple 
identifiers to identify themselves in 
transactions. 
Standardization of the health plan 
identifier is expected to ameliorate some 
routing issues. It is expected to clarify, 
to some extent, the sender or recipient 
of standard transactions, when the 
sender or recipient is a health plan. For 
instance, a health plan that uses 
different identifiers to identify itself in 
covered transactions creates 
inefficiencies and potential confusion 
among its trading partners. Participating 
health care providers that are its trading 
partners, for instance, could be required 
to use different identifiers for different 
transactions, even to identify the same 
health plan. If the HPID is adopted, such 
a health plan would likely use one 
identifier, thereby making it easier for 
the covered health care provider to 
identify the health plan as the sender or 
recipient of the standard transaction. 
By ameliorating routing issues, the 
HPID and OEID will add consistency to 
identifiers, which will provide for a 
higher level of automation, particularly 
for provider processing of the X12 271 
(eligibility response) and X12 835 
(remittance advice). In the case of the 
X12 835, the HPID and OEID will allow 
reconciliation of claims with the claim 
payments to be automated at a higher 
level. 
However, according to testimony and 
industry studies, the most significant 
value of the HPID and what is being 
proposed as the OEID is that they will 
serve as foundations for other regulatory 
and industry initiatives. The 
implementation of HPID, in and of 
itself, may not provide significant 
monetary savings for covered entities, 
with the exception of providing time 
savings by immediately solving certain 
routing issues. Instead, financial 
benefits are expected to be realized 
mostly downstream, when the HPID is 
used in coordination with other 
regulatory and industrial administrative 
simplification initiatives. Testimony 
from the July 19, 2010 NCVHS hearing 
reinforced this idea. 
As an analogy, the standardization of 
the width of railroad tracks does not, in 
and of itself, result in monetary savings. 
However, such standardization has 
ensured connectivity between diverse 
railroad systems that has resulted in 
time and cost savings in the movement 
of freight across the country. In a like 
manner, standardization of a single data 
element in health care transactions does 
not, in and of itself, produce substantial 
time or cost savings. However, the 
diverse identifiers currently used by 
multiple health plans are akin to the 
different track widths used by various 
railroad systems. Like the 
standardization of railroad track widths, 
the HPID serves as a foundation for 
more efficient and cost effective 
transmission of health care information.

22973 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
14 ‘‘National Health Plan Identifier White Paper,’’ 
prepared by the American Medical Association 
(AMA) Practice Management Center (PMC), 
September 22, 2009. 
15 ‘‘Version 5010 and ID–10 Readiness 
Assessment: Conducted among Health Care 
Providers, payers, and Vendors for the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),’’ December, 
2011, Prepared by CMS. 
16 ‘‘Survey: ICD–10 Brief Progress,’’ February 
2012, conducted by the Workgroup for Electronic 
Data Interchange (WEDI). 
17 ‘‘Survey: Industry Reaction to Potential Delay 
of ICD–10—A Delay will be Costly, but Manageable 
* * * Unless it’s more than a Year,’’ February 27, 
2012, conducted by Edifecs. The survey’s 
participants included commercial payers (25%), 
Blue Cross Blue Shield plans (25%), healthcare 
providers (18%), government entities such as State 
Medicaids (9%), medical claim clearinghouses 
(6%), and other healthcare industry organizations 
(17%). 
18 Ibid. 
In an industry white paper, one health 
care provider association echoed the 
foundational importance of the HPID 
and stated that a standard identifier for 
health plans is ‘‘viewed by many as a 
crucial step toward one-stop, automated 
billing.’’ In the same paper, that 
association stated that, in order to begin 
the movement toward automated 
billing, standard identifiers were needed 
for more entities with ‘‘payer’’ function 
than just ‘‘health plans,’’ including 
entities with primary financial 
responsibility for paying a particular 
claim, entities responsible for 
administering a claim, entities that have 
the direct contract with the health care 
provider, and secondary or tertiary 
payers for the claim.14 The association 
went on to contend that fee schedules 
and plan and product types would need 
to be identified with this health plan 
identifier. 
In this rule, we are not proposing that 
the HPID or the OEID contain 
intelligence that would include fee 
schedules or benefit plans or product 
types. However, we are proposing that 
entities other than health plans may get 
an OEID. We view the adoption of the 
HPID and the suggested option of an 
OEID as foundations for the ‘‘one-stop, 
automated billing’’ that this professional 
association advocated. 
This impact analysis will take these 
foundational benefits of HPID and, for 
the sake of illustration, attribute some of 
the monetary savings from the 
downstream results to implementation 
and use of the HPID. It is important to 
view these estimates as an attempt to 
illustrate the foundational effect of the 
HPID rather than as a precise budgetary 
prediction. 
3. Need for a Delay in Implementation 
of ICD–10, and General Impact of 
Implementation 
The ICD–10 final rule requires 
covered entities to comply with ICD–10 
on October 1, 2013. The provisions of 
this proposed rule would change the 
compliance date to October 1, 2014. 
The process of transitioning from 
ICD–9 to ICD–10, if not carefully 
coordinated, poses significant risk to 
provider reimbursement. Should health 
care entities’ infrastructure not be ready 
or thoroughly tested, providers may 
experience returned claims and delayed 
payment for the health care services 
they render to patients. There has been 
mounting evidence over the past several 
months that a significant percentage of 
providers believe they do not have 
sufficient resources or time to be ready 
to meet the October 1, 2013 ICD–10 
compliance deadline. 
Two distinct types of issues are 
implicated by a transition of this 
magnitude, and the costs associated 
with both might be avoided if the ICD– 
10 compliance date is delayed as 
proposed in this rule. First, there may 
be entities that have not readied their 
systems, personnel, or processes to 
achieve compliance by October 1, 2013. 
For example, vendor practice 
management and/or other software must 
be updated to process claims with ICD– 
10 codes, then installed and tested 
internally. Likewise, staff needs to be 
trained and systems and forms prepared 
for the new code set. In a CMS survey 
conducted in November and December 
2011 (hereinafter referred to as the CMS 
readiness survey), 25% of providers 
surveyed indicated that they are at risk 
for not meeting the October 1, 2013 
compliance date.15 In February 2012, 
the Workgroup for Electronic Data 
Interchange (WEDI) conducted a survey 
on ICD–10 readiness (WEDI readiness 
survey) that indicated that nearly 50 
percent of the 2,140 provider 
respondents did not know when they 
would complete their impact 
assessment.16 An illustration of what 
could occur if elements of industry are 
not prepared for the transition to ICD– 
10 can be seen by the January 1, 2012 
transition to Version 5010, where we 
have heard from several provider 
organizations reporting numerous 
practices have not been paid for long 
periods due to the Version 5010 
transition. 
Second, beyond ‘‘readiness’’ and 
‘‘compliance,’’ there are issues that will 
arise if trading partners have not 
thoroughly tested ICD–10. ‘‘Readiness’’ 
is only a self-reported indicator of the 
potential success of an ICD–10 
transition and can be unreliable; we 
know this from similar industry surveys 
done for Version 5010 that indicated 
high levels of readiness only to find 
multiple issues once claims were 
submitted in production mode. The 
other indicator of success is the quality 
and robustness of testing. 
Clearinghouses cannot assist in the ICD– 
10 transition as they are unable to 
correct coding issues without viewing 
the underlying documentation, which is 
not a typical clearinghouse role. In 
general, only a provider can change/ 
modify a code, so it is incumbent upon 
providers to ensure a successful ICD–10 
conversion. In many cases, providers’ 
success will be predicated upon timely 
vendor delivery of ICD–10-compliant 
software, and coordination must be 
developed with payer systems and new 
fee schedules. Providers’ practice 
management systems (PMS) must be 
programmed to process ICD–10 codes, 
and, with many providers transitioning 
to EHRs, there needs to be a well-tested 
interface between electronic health 
records and the PMS. 
In an informal poll conducted by 
Edifecs (hereinafter referred to as the 
Edifecs poll), a health care IT company, 
with responses from 50 senior health 
care officials representing a wide range 
of organizations, 37 percent of 
respondents stated that a 1-year delay 
would be beneficial for them.17 
According to the Edifecs analysis, ‘‘For 
those organizations that have the 
determination to keep moving forward 
as if the delay had never been 
announced, it may end up being a true 
gift on the testing front.’’18 
In the CMS readiness survey, 75 
percent of providers surveyed cited the 
lack of time and/or staff as a barrier to 
implementing ICD–10 on time. The 
survey also indicated that given just 3 
additional months, an additional 14 
percent of providers would be able to 
achieve compliance by December 31, 
2013. This indicates that a delay would 
be helpful in overcoming one of the 
major obstacles to compliance—lack of 
time—and that a delay of a year would 
enable providers to achieve not only 
‘‘readiness’’ in terms of system 
interoperability, but also give the time 
for more thorough testing of ICD–10. 
B. Introduction 
We have examined the impacts of this 
notice of proposed rulemaking as 
required by Executive Order 12866 on 
Regulatory Planning and Review 
(September 30, 1993, as further 
amended), Executive Order 13563 on 
Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review (January 18, 2011), the

22974 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996, Pub. L. 104–121), section 1102(b) 
of the Social Security Act, section 202 
of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4), Executive Order 
13132 on Federalism (August 4, 1999), 
and the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 804(2)). 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety 
effects, distributive impacts, and 
equity). Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes the importance of 
quantifying both costs and benefits, of 
reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, 
and of promoting flexibility. Executive 
Order 13563 also directs agencies not 
only to engage the public and provide 
an opportunity to comment on all 
regulations, but also calls for greater 
communication across all agencies to 
eliminate redundancy, inconsistency, 
and overlapping, as well as outlines 
processes for improving regulation and 
regulatory review. 
A Regulatory Impact Analysis must be 
prepared for major rules with 
economically significant effects ($100 
million in 1995 dollars or more in any 
1-year). Because of the impact on the 
health care industry of the proposed 
adoption, implementation, and use of 
the HPID and the proposed delay in the 
compliance date for ICD–10, this rule 
has been designated an ’’economically’’ 
significant regulatory action, under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 
as it will have an impact of over $100 
million on the economy in any 1 year. 
The impacts of implementing HPID 
and delaying the compliance date for 
transition to ICD–10 are quite different, 
and, because of their respective impacts, 
both provisions of the proposed rule 
would be considered economically 
significant. Accordingly, we have 
prepared two independent RIAs: One 
analysis of the impact of the proposed 
adoption and use of the HPID and one 
for the proposed delay of compliance 
date for transition to the ICD–10. These 
RIAs, to the best of our ability, present 
the costs and benefits of this notice of 
proposed rulemaking, and this proposed 
rule has been reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget. The RIA on 
the proposed delay of ICD–10 follows 
the RIA on the proposed 
implementation and use of the HPID. 
We anticipate that the adoption of the 
HPID and the OEID and the additional 
requirement for organization covered 
health care providers to require certain 
non-covered individuals who are 
prescribers to obtain and use an NPI 
would result in benefits that outweigh 
the costs to providers and health plans. 
We anticipate that the delay of ICD–10 
will have costs to health plans and 
clearinghouses, though it will be 
beneficial to a group of providers. 
In addition, under section 205 of the 
UMRA (2 U.S.C. 1535), having 
considered at least three alternatives for 
the HPID that are referenced in the 
section VI.D. of this proposed rule, HHS 
has concluded that the provisions in 
this rule are the most cost effective 
alternative for implementing HHS’ 
statutory requirements concerning 
administrative simplification. We did 
not consider alternatives to the addition 
to the NPI requirements that is proposed 
in this rule, as the NPI is the standard 
identifier for health care providers 
under HIPAA and based on ongoing 
industry feedback, prescriber NPIs are 
not always available. Therefore, we 
believe a regulatory requirement closing 
the prescriber loophole in the NPI rule 
is necessary to ensure that the 
remaining prescribers without an NPI 
obtain one. We estimate that the 
proposed addition will have little 
financial impact on industry and is 
therefore cost effective in its own right. 
Similarly, we have considered four 
alternatives for delaying ICD–10 
compliance. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 
as amended, requires agencies to 
analyze options for regulatory relief of 
small businesses if a rule has a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. For purposes 
of the RFA, small entities include small 
businesses, nonprofit organizations, and 
small government jurisdictions. Small 
businesses are those with sizes below 
thresholds established by the Small 
Business Administration (SBA). 
Individuals and States are not included 
in the definition of a small entity. 
For purposes of the RFA, most 
physician practices, hospitals and other 
health care providers are small entities, 
either by nonprofit status or by having 
revenues less than $10 million for 
physician practices and less than $34.5 
million for hospitals in any 1 year. We 
have determined that the proposed 
adoption of the HPID in this proposed 
rule will have an impact on a 
substantial number of small entities and 
that an initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis, an analysis on the impact of 
this proposed rule on small entities, is 
required. The regulatory flexibility 
analysis on the impact of the proposed 
adoption of HPID will come after the 
RIA. However, the initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis for HPID concludes 
that, although a significant number of 
small entities may be affected by this 
proposed rule, the economic impact on 
small entities will not be significant. 
We have also determined that the 
proposed delay of the compliance date 
for ICD–10 will have an impact on a 
substantial number of small entities and 
this regulatory flexibility analysis will 
follow the RIA for the proposed delay of 
ICD–10. The initial regulatory flexibility 
analysis for the proposed delay of ICD– 
10 concludes that small entities will be 
positively impacted economically by the 
proposed compliance date delay and 
that there will be no significant burden. 
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act 
requires a regulatory impact analysis for 
‘‘any rule or regulation proposed under 
title XVIII, title XIX, or part B of [the 
Act] that may have a significant impact 
on the operations of a substantial 
number of small rural hospitals.’’ This 
proposed rule, however, is being 
proposed under title XI, part C, 
‘‘Administrative Simplification,’’ of the 
Act, and, therefore, does not apply. As 
to the addition to the NPI requirements, 
the method for compliance by covered 
organization health care providers, 
including small rural hospitals, is 
discretionary, and could vary. It could 
take the form of a verbal directive to 
prescribers whom they employ or 
contract with, to revising hospital 
policies and procedures as part of 
routine updating, or some other option. 
We believe there will not be a 
significant impact to the operations of a 
substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. We seek industry feedback on 
this assumption. 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
also requires that agencies assess 
anticipated costs and benefits before 
issuing any rule whose mandates 
require spending in any 1-year of $100 
million in 1995 dollars, updated 
annually for inflation. In 2012, that 
threshold is approximately $139 
million. This proposed rule contains 
mandates that would likely impose 
spending costs on State governments 
and the private sector, of more than 
$139 million. We will illustrate the 
costs of adoption of the HPID to the 
State governments, specifically the 
impact to State Medicaid programs, and 
to the private sector in our 
consideration of costs to health plans in 
the RIA. As to the addition to the NPI 
requirements, again, since the method 
for compliance by covered organization 
health care providers is discretionary 
and could vary, for example, from a 
verbal directive to prescribers whom 
they employ or contract with, to 
updating employment or contracting

We will illustrate the costs of the 
proposed delay of ICD–10 to State

costs and benefits of the delay of 
compliance of ICD–10. 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a 
proposed rule (and subsequent final 
rule) that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State laws, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
The proposed adoption of the HPID in 
this proposed rule will not have a 
substantial direct effect on State or local 
governments, does not preempt States, 
or otherwise have Federalism 
implications. The proposed delay of 
compliance with ICD–10 in this 
proposed rule will not have a 
substantial direct effect on State or local 
governments, does not preempt States, 
or otherwise have Federalism 
implications. 
C. HPID: Assumptions Regarding the 
Use of Transaction Standards 
1. Current and Projected Use of Three 
Transactions 
A major assumption in our impact 
analysis of the HPID is that the health 
care industry will experience increased 
use of three electronic health care 
standard transactions over the next 10 to 
15 years. The three transactions are the 
eligibility for a health plan transaction, 
the health care claim status transaction, 
and the health care electronic funds 
transfer (EFT) and remittance advice 
transaction. The reason we chose these 
three transactions in particular is 
because we assume these three 
transactions will see the greatest 
increase in use from 2013 to 2023. We 
base the assumption that these three 
transactions will increase in use on the 
following three premises: 
First, the number of total health care 
claims is expected to increase 
considerably in the United States. 
Claims are expected to increase due to 
an aging population that will require an 
increasing number of health care 
services. For instance, aging baby 
boomers will double Medicare’s 
enrollment between 2011 and 2031.19 
Also, the Affordable Care Act is 
expected to increase the number of 
insured adults by 30 to 33 million from 
2016 on.20 Moreover, the average 
American has increased the number of 
visits to a physician’s practice: 
According to data from HHS, ‘‘From 
1997 through 2007, the annual number 
of ambulatory care visits increased by 
25 percent, driven both by the aging of 
the population, as older persons have 
higher visit rates than younger persons 
in general, and by an increase in 
utilization by older persons.’’ 21 All 
these indicators point to a substantial 
increase in patients and patient visits to 
providers. The expected increase in 
patients and patient visits will drive 
providers to seek more automated 
processes in order to check patients’ 
eligibility through the eligibility for a 
health plan transaction, check claim 
status with the health care claim status 
transaction, and receive payments and 
remittance advice through the health 
care EFT and remittance advice 
transaction. 
Second, it is anticipated that the use 
of electronic business transactions and 
electronic transmissions in general is 
expected to become more widespread 
for U.S. businesses and society at large. 
For example, in 2007, the typical 
organization made 26 percent of its 
payments to other business (B2B) 
electronically; by 2010, that percentage 
rose to 43 percent.22 Overall, the 
number of noncash payments among 
consumers and businesses alike 
increased about 4.5 percent per year 
from 2003 to 2009.23 
Third, statutory and regulatory 
initiatives at the State and Federal level 
will drive or attract health care entities 
to increased usage of health care 
electronic transactions. On the Federal 
level, initiatives include the adoption 
and implementation of standards for 
health care EFT and the implementation 
of a unique health plan identifier as 
proposed by this rule. Likewise, the 
increase will be due to the adoption of 
operating rules for the eligibility for a 
health plan transaction and for the 
health care EFTs, and remittance advice 
transaction. The operating rules for the 
eligibility for a health plan transaction 
will go into effect in 2013 and the 
operating rules for the health care EFTs 
transaction, will take effect in 2014. 
While our impact analysis is based on 
the expected increase in usage of three 
HIPAA transactions, other HIPAA 
transactions may increase in use as well. 
However, we have not attempted to 
draw conclusions about other HIPAA 
transactions because (1) there are no 
regulatory attempts to streamline other 
transactions in the near term (with, for 
example, the adoption of operating 
rules); and (2) we have less of an 
understanding of the impact that 
implementation of the HPID will have 
on covered transactions other than these 
three. 
Table 5 lists our assumptions on the 
increased use of these three HIPAA 
transactions between 2013 and 2023. 
We have calculated the 2013 
estimates—for example, our baseline— 
based on a number of sources and 
calculations: 
• We estimated the number of 
eligibility requests (electronic and non- 
electronic) by taking 90 percent 24 of the 
total the projected number of claims.25 
The percentage estimate of electronic 
eligibility requests as a proportion of 
total eligibility requests in 2013 is 
derived from an analysis of a number of 
different industry studies on electronic 
data interchange (EDI) usage.26 
• Similarly, we estimated the number 
of claim status requests by taking 0.14 
percent of the total projected number of 
claims.27 The percentage estimate of 
electronic claim status requests as a 
proportion of total claim status request 
in 2013 is derived from an analysis of

• For remittance advice, we started 
with the projection for national health 
expenditures 29 and used Medicare data 
to arrive at the average dollar amount of 
a single payment.30 Using that 
calculation, we were able to estimate the 
projected number of health care claim 
payments for 2013 considering the ratio 
of remittance advice per payment 
according to Medicare data.31 The 
percentage estimate of electronic 
remittance advice as a proportion of 
total remittance advice was calculated 
using a weighted average of Medicare 
data (electronic remittance advice as a 
percentage of total remittance advice), 
VHA data,32 and industry studies.33 
We have projected the percentage use 
of EDI out to 2023 using a number of 
calculations: 
• In the Eligibility and Claim Status 
Operating Rules IFC published in the 
July 8, 2011 Federal Register (76 FR 
40458), we projected that electronic 
eligibility requests will increase by 15 
percent year over year from 2013 
through 2017 and by 8 percent year over 
year from 2018 through 2022 due to a 
number of factors. See the Eligibility 
and Claim Status Operating Rules IFC 
(76 FR 40481) for the assumptions 
behind that projection. Note that, 
despite the 15 percent increase, the 
number of claims (patient visits) will 
increase substantially over that same 
period, so the percentage of electronic 
eligibility requests as a proportion of all 
eligibility requests will increase at a 
much slower rate. 
• In the Eligibility and Claim Status 
Operating Rules IFC, we projected that 
electronic claim status inquiries will 
increase by 20 percent year over year 
from 2013 through 2017 and by 10 
percent year over year from 2018 
through 2022 due to a number of factors. 
See the Eligibility and Claim Status 
Operating Rules IFC (76 FR 40481) for 
the assumptions behind that projection. 
Again, despite the year over year 
increases, the number of claims (patient 
visits) will increase substantially over 
that same period, so the percentage of 
electronic claim status requests as a 
proportion of all claim status requests 
will increase at a much slower rate. 
• We have noted previously the 
reasons why we predict that electronic 
transactions, overall, will increase, 
including a substantial increase in the 
number of claims, more widespread use 
of electronic transactions by U.S. 
businesses and society at large, and 
State and Federal mandates requiring or 
promoting electronic transactions of 
health information. Due to these 
reasons, we estimate 20 percent increase 
of electronic remittance advice 
transactions year over year from 2013 
through 2018, and a 12 percent increase 
year over year from 2019 through 2023. 
Again, despite the year over year 
increases, the number of total 
remittance advice transactions will 
increase substantially over that same 
period, so the percentage of electronic 
remittance advice as a proportion of all 
remittance advice will increase at a 
much slower rate. 
We believe these estimates to be 
conservative: The increase in patients 
and patient visits in the next decade 
alone may drive a greater number of 
health care entities to adopt EDI. 
However, we recognize the uncertainties 
inherent in this projection, and we are 
specifically soliciting comments on 
these assumptions.

2. Projected Increased Use of Three 
Transactions Attributable to 
Implementation of HPID 
When attempting to quantify 
anticipated savings, we recognize that 
some of increased use of three HIPAA 
transactions from 2013 to 2023 will be 
attributable to the implementation of 
administrative simplification initiatives, 
including the adoption of the EFT 
standard, operating rules for four 
transactions, and Version 5010 of the 
HIPAA transactions as implemented by 
the Modifications final rule. Therefore, 
we attribute some of the savings that are 
derived from an increased use in these 
transactions to these other initiatives. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, 
we will assume a percentage of the 
increase in use of electronic transactions 
by health care providers and health 
plans as attributable to implementation 
of an HPID in order to illustrate that the 
HPID is foundational for overall 
administrative simplification (Table 6). 
Our basic argument is echoed in the 
Transactions and Code Sets proposed 
rule, NPI proposed rule, and the 
Modifications to the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) Electronic Transaction 
Standards proposed rule (73 FR 49742), 
published in the Federal Register on 
August 22, 2008, (hereinafter referred to 
as the Modifications proposed rule): 
Administrative simplification initiatives 
drive covered entities to increase their 
usage of electronic transactions, and 
electronic transactions have substantial 
cost savings over manual transactions. 
The implementation of administrative 
simplification initiatives mandated by 
the Affordable Care Act is expected to 
streamline HIPAA electronic

transactions, make them more 
consistent, and decrease the 
dependence on manual intervention in 
the transmission of health care and 
payment information. This, in turn, will 
drive more health care providers and 
health plans to utilize electronic 
transactions in their operations. 
The anticipated cost savings of all 
administrative simplification 
regulations and initiatives, therefore, 
can be divided into two categories: 
Materials and time. First, the material 
cost savings that results from each 
transaction that moves from a non- 
electronic, manual transmission of 
information to an electronic transaction. 
These cost savings result from covered 
entities using less paper, postage, and 
equipment which are required for 
paper-based transactions. Second, the 
use of electronic transactions to conduct 
billing and insurance related tasks takes 
considerable less time than when the 
same transactions are done through 
phone, email or postal mail, or 
manually. Therefore, each move from 
non-electronic transaction to an 
electronic transaction results in staff- 
time savings and cost reductions. 
The estimated cost and benefits of 
implementation and use of HPID need 
to be understood in the context of the 
HPID being foundational to other 
administrative simplification initiatives, 
both those initiated by industry and 
those regulated by State or Federal 
governments. If other initiatives do not 
follow, then the HPID will likely have 
little substantive impact. The ranges 
given of possible cost and benefit 
impacts are reflective of the uncertainty 
inherent in multifactorial environments 
such as the health care industry. 
To illustrate the foundational aspects 
of the HPID, we estimated a range of 
overall increase of 1 to 2 percent per 
year, starting in 2015, in the use of both 
the eligibility for a health plan 
transaction and the claim status 
transaction ‘‘attributable’’ to 
implementation of the HPID over the 
next decade. In addition, we estimate a 
1 to 3 percent increase in the use of 
electronic health care payment and 
remittance advice transaction 
attributable to implementation of the 
HPID because the routing of that 
transaction is especially important for 
the payment process. Given the overall 
increase in both EDI and health care 
transactions in general expected over 
the next decade, this annual increase 
attributable to HPID accounts for a small 
percentage of electronic transactions as 
a proportion of total transactions over 
those 10 years. For example, after an 
annual increase in remittance advice 
due to implementation of the HPID of 1 
to 3 percent from 2013 through 2023, 
ultimately, only 1 to 2 percent of all 
electronic remittance advice 
transactions from 2013 through 2023 
will be attributable to implementation of 
the HPID. We welcome comments about 
this approach from industry and other 
stakeholders.

D. Alternatives Considered Regarding 
the HPID and NPI 
In deciding to adopt the HPID as the 
format for the national unique health 
plan identifier, we considered a number 
of alternatives, on which we solicit 
public and stakeholder comments. As 
noted, we did not consider alternatives 
to the addition to the NPI requirements. 
For the most part, the HPID 
alternatives were not chosen because 
they were inconsistent with the 
testimony given at the July 2010 NCVHS 
hearing on HPID and because they were 
not included in NCHVS’ 
recommendations. As noted previously, 
section 1172(f) of the Act provides that 
‘‘the Secretary shall rely on the 
recommendations of the National 
Committee on Vital and Health 
Statistics established under section 
306(k) of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 242k(k)). * * *’’ Section 
1104(c) (1) of the Affordable Care Act 
directs the Secretary to promulgate a 
final rule to establish a unique health 
plan identifier ‘‘based on input of the 
National Committee on Vital and Health 
Statistics.’’ The NCVHS 
recommendations recommended what it 
thought was the most cost effective and 
efficient approach to standardizing the 
HPID, and, consequently, the Secretary 
has relied heavily on its 
recommendations for these proposals. 
1. The NAIC Company Code 
The NAIC Company Code is a 5-digit 
alphanumeric identifier that resides in a 
proprietary database maintained by the 
NAIC. The company code is assigned to 
insurers, including managed care 
organizations, to identify insurance 
companies on financial reports filed 
with the States. We decided against 
using the NAIC company code because 
it has embedded intelligence, multiple 
company codes have been assigned to 
the same insurer for the same line of 
business, and fewer than half of the 
entities with NAIC company codes are 
entities listed in the statute as health 
plans. In addition, a 5-digit number 
would only allow 100,000 entities to be 
enumerated. We also considered the 
NAIC Company Code to be a 
comparably expensive alternative. 
2. The Federal Tax Identification 
Number 
The EIN, also referred to as a Federal 
Tax Identification Number, was 
designed and is used to identify 
business entities for tax purposes. While 
the EIN is an appropriate and cost- 
effective standard for the unique 
employer identifier, we do not believe it 
would be appropriate for the standard 
for the unique health plan identifier for 
the following reasons. Using the EIN to 
identify employers and health plans 
under HIPAA could cause confusion 
among users of the numbers. Also, the 
current EIN scheme does not cover all 
health plans, for instance, an employer 
group health plan would not have its 
own EIN, so the EIN would need to be 
expanded to accommodate all health 
plans. 
3. IRS Identifier 
We also considered the IRS and DOL 
Identifier. An Employee Benefit Plan 
subject to ERISA may be required to file

an Annual Report/Report of Employee 
Benefit Program Plan (Form 5500 Series 
Reports). This includes Pension Benefit 
Plans, and Direct Filing Entities. The 
IRS and DOL have combined their filing 
requirements on Form 5500 Series 
Report to minimize the efforts of plan 
administrators and employers. The 
Form 5500 Series Reports are used by 
both the IRS and the DOL for audit 
purposes to ensure that the employee 
benefit plans are operated and managed 
in accordance with certain prescribed 
standards and to protect the rights and 
benefits of participants. These benefit 
plans use their 9-digit EIN with a 3-digit 
suffix that is assigned according to the 
type of plan they offer. The IRS provides 
very specific guidelines on the selection 
of the 3-digit suffix. The 3-digit suffix 
has required guidelines that would be 
too specific for the purposes of the 
HPID. In addition, this format would not 
be capable of incorporating a check digit 
without modification. Therefore, we did 
not consider the IRS identifier as a 
viable alternative for identifying health 
plans in a manner consistent with our 
statutory mandates and our program 
objectives. 
E. Impacted Entities—HPID and NPI 
All HIPAA covered entities may be 
affected by the standard proposed in 
this proposed rule although, as we 
estimate, only a segment of covered 
entities will have substantive cost or 
benefits associated with the adoption of 
the HPID. HIPAA covered entities 
include all health plans, health care 
clearinghouses, and health care 
providers that transmit health 
information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a standard. 
Table 7 outlines the number of 
entities that may be affected by the 
HPID and OEID, along with the sources 
of those data.

F. Scope and Methodology of the Impact 
Analysis for the HPID and NPI 
This impact analysis estimates the 
costs and benefits that will be realized 
through the implementation and use of 
the HPID. We do not analyze the costs 
and benefits of the addition to the NPI 
requirements, apart from the costs 
associated with applying for an NPI that 
are already addressed in section V.B. of 
this proposed rule concerning the 
collection of information requirements. 
Aside from the time necessary to apply, 
we do not anticipate any financial 
impact as a result of the addition to the 
NPI requirements. We ask for comments 
on this approach. 
In this RIA, we do not analyze the 
impact of implementation and use of the 
OEID. The OEID, as proposed herein, 
would be a data element that could be 
voluntarily used by entities other than 
health plans. These other entities may 
include, for example, health care 
clearinghouses, transaction vendors, 
and third party administrators that 
provide administration or management 
for self-insured health plans. The range 
of total entities that may apply for and 
use an OEID is zero to approximately 
900 entities (750 Third party 
administrators + 169 transaction

34 ‘‘Excess Billing and Insurance-Related 
Administrative Costs,’’ by James Kahn, in The 
Healthcare Imperative; Lowering Costs and 
Improving Outcomes: Workshop Series Summary, 
edited by Pierre L. Yong, Robert S. Saunders, and 
Leigh Anne Olsen, Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academies, the National Academies Press, 
Washington, DC: 2010. 
vendors). Therefore, using the 
methodology we use in this RIA, the 
cost for implementation of the OEID for 
other entities ranges from no cost to 
approximately $500 million, depending 
on choices made by those entities. 
Because of the uncertainty inherent in 
this range of cost, based on the number 
of entities that may apply for the OEID 
we will not attempt to quantify the 
impact of applying for or using an OEID 
beyond this limited analysis. Nor will 
we include this range of costs in our 
summary of this RIA. However, we can 
assume that implementing and using 
OEID would be accompanied by a 
proportional range of costs and benefits 
akin to the cost and benefits estimated 
for health plans in this RIA. We 
welcome comments on the number and 
kind of entities that may apply for and 
use an OEID. We estimate the cost of the 
Enumeration System to be $1.5 million. 
The Federal Government will bear the 
costs associated with the Enumeration 
System that will enumerate health plans 
and other entities and maintain their 
information. These include the costs of 
enumerating health plans and other 
entities, the cost of maintaining health 
plan and other entity information in the 
Enumeration System, and the costs of 
disseminating HPID and OEID data to 
the health care industry and others, as 
appropriate. HHS will develop the 
Enumeration System, and conduct the 
updating and data dissemination 
activities. We will apply this cost to our 
summary of costs and the accounting 
statement, but will not provide any 
further analysis of this cost within the 
narrative of the RIA. 
The costs to health plans of applying 
for an HPID and updating and 
maintaining the information in the 
Enumeration System are detailed in 
section III of this proposed rule. We will 
reflect these costs in the summary of the 
costs to health plans in this RIA. 
While we assume that adoption of the 
health plan identifier standards will 
affect a broad range of health care 
providers, as illustrated in Table 7, we 
will only be examining the costs and 
benefits of implementation and use of 
the HPID on two types of health care 
providers: Hospitals and physician 
practices. We will not analyze the 
impact to nursing and residential care 
facilities, dentists, or suppliers of 
durable medical equipment. 
There are two reasons for narrowing 
the scope of this analysis to only two 
categories of health care providers: we 
have very little data on the usage of EDI 
among dentists, suppliers of durable 
medical equipment, nursing homes, and 
residential care facilities. The lack of 
data for these types of health care 
providers has been noted in other 
studies on administrative 
simplification.34 We assume that the 
greatest benefits will be gained by 
hospitals and physician practices as 
they conduct the majority of standard 
transactions. We welcome comment 
from industry and the public as to our 
assumptions. 
We have not included an analysis of 
the impact on pharmacies because the 
HPID will not be used extensively in 
electronic transactions by the pharmacy 
industry. This industry will instead be 
using the BIN/IIN and PCN as described 
previously in this proposed rule. 
Therefore, we assume no impact on 
pharmacies. 
With respect to health care providers, 
only health care providers that transmit 
health information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a HIPAA 
transaction standard are considered 
covered entities. 
We assume that the HPID may be used 
to identify health plans in non- 
electronic transactions as well, but, as 
this standard is only required for use in 
HIPAA standard transactions, we have 
not tried to measure the impact on non- 
electronic transactions. The costs and 
benefits included in this analysis do not 
include infrastructure or software costs 
for health care providers who are 
equipping their practices for the 
transmittal of electronic transactions for 
the first time. The costs in this impact 
analysis include only those that are 
necessary to implement the standard for 
the national unique health plan 
identifier. 
We include health care 
clearinghouses and transaction vendors 
as affected entities in Table 7. 
Transaction vendors are entities that 
process claims or payments for other 
entities, which may include health 
plans. Transaction vendors may not 
meet the HIPAA definition of health 
care clearinghouse, but as used in this 
context, health care clearinghouses 
would constitute a subset of transaction 
vendors. Payment vendors would be a 
type of transaction vendor—a 
transaction vendor that ‘‘associates’’ or 
‘‘reassociates’’ health care claim 
payments with the payments’ 
remittance advice for either a health 
plan or provider. For our purposes here, 
transaction vendors do not include 
developers or retailers of computer 
software, or entities that are involved in 
installing, programming or maintaining 
computer software. Health care 
clearinghouses and transaction vendors 
may be impacted because their systems 
would have to accommodate the 
adoption of the new standards such as 
the HPID to identify health plans in 
standard transactions. However, we did 
not calculate costs and benefits to health 
care clearinghouses and transaction 
vendors in this cost analysis because we 
assume that any associated costs and 
benefits will be passed on to the health 
plans or providers, and will be included 
in the costs and benefits we apply to 
health plans or providers. 
We use the total number of health 
insurance issuers as the number of 
commercial health plans that will be 
affected by this proposed rule, and will 
use this number in our impact analysis. 
A health insurance issuer is an 
insurance company, insurance service, 
or insurance organization, including an 
HMO, that is required to be licensed to 
engage in the business of insurance in 
a State, and that is subject to State law 
that regulates insurance. Although this 
number is specific to the individual and 
small group markets, we assume that 
many health insurance issuers in the 
large group market are included in this 
number because they are likely to 
market to individuals and small groups 
as well. While the category or ‘‘health 
insurance issuers’’ represents a larger 
number of health plans than those 
included in the NAICs codes for ‘‘Direct 
Health and Medical Insurance Carriers’’ 
(897 firms), we believe the category of 
health insurance issuers is a more 
accurate representation of companies 
conducting HIPAA transactions. 
Companies that provide Medicaid 
managed care plans are included in the 
category of commercial health plans. 
Although self-insured group health 
plans meet the HIPAA definition of 
‘‘health plan,’’ we did not include them 
in this impact analysis. While self- 
insured group health plans will be 
required to obtain the HPID, we assume 
that, with a few exceptions, such plans 
do not send or receive HIPAA electronic 
transactions because most are not 
involved in the day-to-day activities of 
a health plan and outsource those 
services to third party administrators or 
transaction vendors. Because they do 
not meet the definition of ‘‘health 
plans,’’ TPAs and transactions vendors 
are not required to obtain or use an 
HPID, though they may elect to obtain 
and use an OEID. The costs and benefits 
associated with the HPID are applicable 
only to entities that are directly 
involved in sending or receiving

standard transactions, though we 
recognize that some of the cost and 
benefits will trickle down to employers 
and their employees. 
We have no data concerning how 
many health plans are actually 
identified in standard transactions, as 
opposed to ‘‘other entities’’ that are 
identified in their stead. Therefore, we 
have no assurance of how many health 
plans may be affected by this proposed 
rule. We base our cost estimates on the 
highest number of entities that would 
likely be affected. The number of health 
plans is used as a factor in our 
calculation of costs, but not in our 
calculation for savings. We are therefore 
taking a conservative approach to the 
costs to health plans which we believe 
is warranted given the uncertainties in 
our estimates. We solicit industry and 
stakeholder comments on our 
assumptions. 
G. Costs Associated with HPID and NPI 
Due to a lack of baseline data, we use 
the cost estimate calculations provided 
in the impact analysis for the 
Modifications proposed rule and the 
clarifications of that impact analysis 
contained in the Modifications final 
rule. 
We chose the costs in the 
Modifications proposed and final rules 
as our baseline for costs for a number of 
reasons: 
• The cost categories in the 
Modifications rules are similar to the 
cost categories anticipated by 
implementation of the HPID: one-time 
or short-term costs such as software 
conversion, and cost of automation, 
training, implementation, and 
implementation guides. 
• There are no analogous national 
standard identifiers from which to 
derive costs and benefits. 
In our discussion of the HPID, we 
considered the NPI as a potential 
analogous identifier; however, the cost/ 
benefit analysis for the NPI, included in 
the ‘‘National Standard Health Care 
Provider Identifier,’’ proposed rule,’’ 
published in the May 7, 1998 Federal 
Register (63 FR 25320) does not analyze 
the cost/benefits of implementation of 
the NPI itself. Instead, the analysis 
reiterates the cost/benefits of the 
Transactions and Code Sets final rule 
(65 FR 50312). The Transactions and 
Code Sets final rule analyzes the costs/ 
benefits of sending and receiving all 
HIPAA transactions. The Modifications 
final rule is another reiteration of the 
original cost/benefit analysis of the 
Transactions and Code Sets final rule, 
but the data has been adjusted to 2009, 
and so we will use it because it is more 
recent but adjust the costs to 2012 
dollars. In the impact analysis for the 
Modifications final rule, the estimated 
costs to implement the update to the 
standards were 25 percent less 
(minimum) to 50 percent (maximum) of 
the costs estimated in the Transactions 
and Code Sets final rule. 
To determine the anticipated costs for 
health care providers and health plans, 
we used 25 percent of the cost estimates 
for the Modifications final rule. We used 
this percentage because we determined 
that implementation of HPID will not be 
as significant as the impact of Version 
5010 adopted in the Modifications final 
rule for the following reasons: First, the 
implementation of the Modifications 
final rule is much broader and more 
complex than the implementation of a 
unique health plan identifier. The 
Modifications rule broadly amends or 
alters every HIPAA transaction 
standard. This rule proposes a standard 
that will need to be included in every 
HIPAA transaction; however, it is only 
one data field, compared to a multitude 
of data fields that were affected by the 
adoption of the transaction standards 
outlined in the Modifications final rule. 
Second, we believe covered entities 
are more prepared for the 
implementation of the HPID than they 
may have been for the Modifications 
final rule. Because the standards for 
transactions and codes sets, security and 
privacy, employer identifier, and health 
care provider identifier have already 
been adopted, we assume that covered 
entities have already made significant 
system investments. In addition, a data 
field already exists for the health plan 
identifier in the HIPAA standard 
transactions. 
To support our estimate that the HPID 
will cost 25 percent of the costs of the 
Modifications final rule, we make a 
number of assumptions. We assume 
many of the implementation costs 
covered entities will experience will be 
short term or one-time costs for system 
implementation and transition costs. 
System implementation costs include 
software and software development, 
testing, training, and other conversion 
costs. Conversion will require training 
for staff and will require changes to 
documentation, procedures, records, 
and software. Some covered health care 
entities may choose to use the services 
of software system vendors, billing 
companies, transaction vendors, and/or 
health care clearinghouses to facilitate 
the transition to the HPID. 
‘‘Transition’’ costs, which we assume 
will occur in the second and third years 
of implementation, are defined as the 
post-implementation costs for 
monitoring, maintaining, and adjusting 
the upgraded systems and related 
processes with trading partners until all 
parties reach a ‘‘steady state’’ with 
regard to utilizing the HPID. While there 
will be initial costs to implement the 
HPID, we believe a standard HPID will 
simplify standard transactions and 
improve their efficiency and 
effectiveness. In addition, the lack of 
embedded intelligence within the HPID 
will result in lower implementation and 
maintenance costs for covered entities. 
1. Costs of HPID to Health Plans 
Health plans will bear most of the cost 
of implementing the HPID. We estimate 
the cost to health plans to implement 
and use an HPID will be 25 percent of 
the costs that the impact analysis in the 
Modifications final rule calculated in 
order for industry to implement Version 
5010 of the standard transactions. As 
noted previously, implementation of the 
HPID will be analogous to—yet 
significantly less than—implementation 
of Version 5010 because the same 
systems will be affected, and, in both 
cases, there are both implementation 
and transition costs. Beyond these 
general similarities, we assume that 
implementation of HPID will be much 
less expensive for the reasons stated 
previously. 
The estimate that HPID 
implementation and transition will be 
25 percent of the cost of Version 5010 
is a conservative estimate, we believe, 
and it is probable that the costs will be 
much less. However, by estimating 
HPID implementation at 25 percent of 
the cost of Version 5010, we are able to 
reflect the uncertainty in our 
calculations because our calculations 
maintain the range of minimum and 
maximum costs from the Modifications 
final rule. 
In addition, the cost estimates from 
the Modifications final rule have been 
adjusted down because we estimate 
there will be fewer health plans 
impacted by this rule than are impacted 
by the Modifications final rule. For costs 
associated with applying for and 
obtaining an HPID, see section V.A. of 
this proposed rule. We welcome 
comments and data from the industry 
and other stakeholders on this 
assumption. 
To comply with this proposed rule, a 
health plan that is not a small health 
plan must start using the HPID in the 
standard transactions on or after 
October 1, 2014 (small health plans 
must start using the HPID in the 
standard transactions on or after 
October 1, 2015). As we note in the 
RFA, section V.J.1.d of this proposed 
rule, there are, perhaps, 100 health 
plans that can be defined as small 
health plans. While we expect these

costs will accrue between the time the 
final rule is published and the date the 
HPID is fully implemented, for purposes 
of simplification we have placed all 
system implementation costs— 
including those for small health plans— 
in 2014. Transition costs will occur in 
2015 and 2016.

2. Costs of HPID for Physician Practices 
and Hospitals 
Covered physician practices and 
hospitals will be required to use the 
HPID in standard transactions. Health 
care providers that do not conduct 
covered transactions (for example, by 
submitting a paper claim that the health 
plan subsequently transmits 
electronically to a secondary payer) 
could also use the HPID, but would not 
be required to do so. Implementation 
costs for covered physician practices 
and hospitals depend on whether they 
generate claims directly or use a health 
care clearinghouse or transaction 
vendor. 
If covered physician practices and 
hospitals submit claims directly, they 
would incur implementation costs in 
converting their systems to 
accommodate the HPID. Some covered 
health care providers may choose to use 
the services of software system vendors, 
billing companies, transaction vendors, 
and/or health care clearinghouses to 
facilitate the transition to the HPID. 
These health care providers would incur 
costs in the form of potential fee 
increases from billing agents or health 
care clearinghouses. For example, if a 
health care provider pays a fee to a 
billing agent or health care 
clearinghouse to process its health care 
transactions, the billing agent or health 
care clearinghouse might increase the 
cost to perform this service for the 
health care provider. 
Table 9 illustrates the costs to covered 
hospitals and physician practices. 
Again, the costs are 25 percent of the 
costs estimated in the Modifications 
proposed and final rules. We invite 
comments on our assumptions and 
method for estimating the 
implementation costs.

H. Savings Associated With HPID and 
NPI 
1. Savings to Health Plans 
We have identified two areas in 
which health plans will experience 
savings due to the adoption of HPID: A 
reduction in the number of pended 
claims and an increased use of 
electronic health care transactions. 
2. Pended Claims 
Pended claims are claims that 
necessitate a manual review by the 
health plan. Pended claims are more 
expensive than ‘‘clean’’ claims, which 
do not require a manual review or

additional information in order to be 
processed. We are projecting a 5 to 10 
percent annual reduction of pended 
claims as attributable to implementation 
of the HPID. We have calculated the 
savings that would come from this 
estimated projection from: data about 
claims receipts from the trade 
association America’s Health Insurance 
Plans (AHIP),35 information about 
eligibility transactions from the Oregon 
Provider and Payer Survey,36 and data 
from the Modifications proposed and 
final rules. 
One of the main goals of the use of the 
HPID is to have a consistent identifier 
for each health plan for use in standard 
transactions. This lack of a single 
identifier has resulted in the need for 
manual intervention to resolve 
eligibility questions and billing and 
payment issues when there are 
inconsistent approaches for identifying 
health plans. Covered health care 
providers would no longer have to keep 
track of and use multiple identifiers for 
a single health plan. After the initial 
outlay for changes to their systems, 
health care providers would be able to 
consistently identify the health plan to 
which they must submit claims. 
According to AHIP, 14 percent of all 
claims were pended by health plans.37 
Assuming 6 billion claims will be 
submitted in 2014, as is projected in the 
Modifications proposed rule, this 
calculates to about 850 million pended 
claims (Table 10, Column 2). 
We will assume that pended claims 
will decrease by a minimum of 5 
percent to a maximum of 10 percent 
annually attributable to use of the HPID 
(Table 10, Columns 4 and 6). This 
estimate is based on an AHIP survey 
entitled, ‘‘An Updated Survey of Health 
Care Claim Receipt and Processing 
Times.’’ The survey concluded that 35 
percent of all claims are pended because 
they are duplicate claims (or assumed to 
be duplicate claims), 12 percent are 
pended because of the lack of necessary 
information, 5 percent because of 
coordination of benefits (COB), and 
1percent because of invalid codes.38 
The HPID may help alleviate these 
particular pended claims issues by 
enabling the automation of the COB 
process 39 and providing for more 
accurate routing of claims to the correct 
payer. This conclusion presumes that 
providing an HPID will lead to a 
measurable reduction of duplicate 
claims and/or claims pended because of 
a lack of necessary information. There is 
a large measure of uncertainty in this 
assumption and, as noted, the HPID 
would be foundational for subsequent 
activities such as the automation of the 
COB process. By itself, though, the HPID 
does not automate any processes. To 
reflect the uncertainty, we apply a range 
of percentages to the assumption. 
According to AHIP, it costs a health 
plan $0.85 to reply electronically to a 
‘‘clean’’ claim submission and $2.05 to 
reply to claims that ‘‘necessitate manual 
or other review cost.’’ Therefore, a 
health plan could save $1.20 per claim 
by automating a claim otherwise 
needing manual review (Table 10, 
Column 3). In order to calculate the 
savings from a 5 to 10 percent decrease 
in pended claims due to 
implementation of the HPID, we 
multiply the projected number of 
pended claims (Table 10, Column 2) 
times 5 percent for the low estimate and 
10 percent for the high estimate. We 
then multiplied the high and low range 
of numbers of pended claims that will 
be avoided due to use of HPID times the 
$1.20 per claim that can be saved. 
In considering how to project this cost 
avoidance, we decided that the 5 to 10 
percent savings should continue each 
year over the 10 years following 
implementation of the standard, 
resulting in a savings of approximately 
$700 million to $1.4 billion. As stated 
previously, we consider the HPID 
standards in this notice of proposed 
rulemaking to be foundational standards 
that will be built upon by future 
operating rules and regulations over the 
next decade. 
We welcome input and data from 
industry and other stakeholders with 
regard to these assumptions.

3. Increase in Electronic Transmittal of 
Three Standard Transactions 
The implementation of all 
administrative simplification initiatives 
mandated by the Affordable Care Act 
are expected to streamline HIPAA 
electronic transactions, make them more 
consistent, and decrease the 
dependence on manual intervention in 
the transmission of health care and 
payment information. This, in turn, will 
drive more health care providers and 
health plans to utilize electronic 
transactions in their operations. Each 
transaction that moves from a non- 
electronic, manual transmission of 
information to an electronic transaction, 
brings with it material and time cost 
savings by virtue of reducing or 
eliminating the paper, postage, and 
equipment and additional staff time 
required to conduct paper-based 
transactions. 
Table 11 lists our estimates of the 
savings for health plans when they 
move from a non-electronic transaction 
to an electronic transaction on a per 
transaction basis. For a more detailed 
description of how we arrived at the 
savings associated with the eligibility 
for a health plan transaction and the 
health care claim status transactions, see 
the RIA in the ‘‘Administrative 
Simplification: Adoption of Operating 
Rules for Eligibility for a Health Plan 
and Health Care Claim Status 
Transactions,’’ published in the July 8, 
2011 Federal Register (76 FR 40471). 
The estimated savings associated with 
the health care payment and remittance 
advice transaction is taken from 
Medicare data. Medicare found that the 
average estimated cost avoidance in 
terms of printing and mailing charges 
was $4.24 per electronic remittance 
advice transaction when it was sent 
electronically as opposed to through the 
mail in paper form.

We expect that the use of the HPID 
will result in greater efficiency and 
savings across all HIPAA transactions in 
addition to the three transactions we 
specifically analyze here. However, we 
expect that the impact will be 
considerably less in other transactions 
because operating rules for these 
transactions will likely take effect a 
number of years after the 
implementation of the HPID. 
We estimate an annual increase of 1 
(LOW) to 2 (HIGH) percent in the use of 
the eligibility for a health plan 
transaction and the health care claim 
status transaction attributable to the 
implementation of the HPID over the 
next 10 years as illustrated in Table 12. 
We estimate an annual increase of 2 
(LOW) to 3 (HIGH) percent in the use of 
the electronic remittance advice 
transaction resulting from the adoption 
of the HPID. These are not annual 
increases in percentage points, but 
rather percent increases in the use of 
electronic transactions from the year 
before. The impact of the HPID on the 
electronic health care payment and 
remittance advice transaction is more 
than the impact on the other two 
transactions because NCVHS testimony 
supported the notion that the greatest 
impact of a standardized health plan 
identifier would be on the payment 
process.40 
Based on these assumptions, we 
estimate that the savings to health plans 
because of increased usage in three 
transactions will be at least $500,000 
within 10 years of HPID 
implementation. Health plan savings are 
summarized in Table 13.

4. Savings to Health Care Providers 
We have quantified two areas of 
savings for health care providers. First, 
time and money will be saved at an 
administrative-level because of a 
decrease in claims issues that require 
manual intervention. Medical practices 
will experience these administrative 
savings by virtue of decreased time 
spent interacting with health plans. 
Second, material savings will be derived 
because of an increase in the number of 
transactions that are conducted 
electronically, as we explained in our 
discussion of the potential impact of 
this rule on health plans. 
a. Time Savings for Health Care 
Providers 
One of the main goals of the use of the 
HPID is to have a consistent identifier 
for each health plan for use in standard 
transactions. This lack of a single 
identifier has resulted in the need for 
manual intervention to resolve 
eligibility questions and billing and 
payment issues when there are 
inconsistent approaches for identifying 
health plans. Covered health care 
providers would no longer have to keep 
track of and use multiple identifiers for 
a single controlling health plan. After 
the initial outlay for changes to their 
systems, health care providers would be 
able to simplify their billing systems 
and processes and reduce 
administrative expenses. 
The HPID would also assist and 
simplify coordination of benefits. Health 
plans that have sole or shared fiduciary 
responsibilities for payment would be 
more readily identified, and the 
movement of information among these 
entities would be enhanced. According 
to a 2009 study published in Health 
Affairs, approximately 60 hours per 
physician per week are spent on average 
interacting with health plans when the 
time spent by the single physician, the 
staff, and the physician practice’s 
administration are totaled.41 Of the time 
spent interacting with health plans, 88 
percent was spent on authorizations and 
claims/billing issues. 
We believe the implementation of an 
HPID will eliminate some of the manual 
intervention that is required when there 
are questions or errors identifying the 
entity responsible for eligibility of a 
patient or the payment of a claim. We 
estimate that the implementation and 
use of an HPID by health plans would 
save a physician’s practice a number of 
phone calls and emails otherwise 
required to investigate or verify the 
identifier needed for the health plan. Of 
the 60 hours reported previously, our 
estimate would be that 15 minutes to 30 
minutes per week—or .4 to .8 percent of 
the total time spent interacting with

Supply and Demand: Projections Through 2025,

Projections Through 2025,’’ June 2010, AAMC. 
health plans—could be eliminated if the 
HPID were implemented. We welcome 
input on our assumption. 
Table 14 illustrates the savings if a 
physician’s office spends 15 to 30 
minutes a week interacting with health 
plans. Table 14, Column I shows the 
number of hours spent per week per 
physician interacting with health plans, 
according to the 2009 Health Affairs 
study. This number represents the sum 
total of hours spent by the physician, 
the physician’s staff, and senior 
administrative staff, accountants, and 
lawyers that support the physician. 
Table 14, Column II is the low to high 
estimate of 15 to 30 minutes (or .4 to .8 
percent of the total time spent 
interacting with health plans) that we 
estimate would be saved with the 
implementation of the HPID. 
Table 14, Column III is the annual 
cost for a physician’s office of 
interacting with a health plan, based on 
time spent and hourly wages of various 
employees of a physician’s office, 
according to the 2009 Health Affairs 
study. The wages are adjusted 3 percent 
annually to account for cost of living 
increases. 
Table 14, Column IV is the estimate 
of savings generated by decreasing the 
time spent interacting with health plans 
by 15 minutes a week (LOW). It is the 
low estimate of the percentage reduction 
in time (Table 14, Column II) times the 
annual cost per physicians of interacting 
with health plans (Table 14, Column 
III). Table 14, Column V is the high 
estimate of savings generated by 
decreasing the time spent interacting 
with health plans by 30 minutes a week 
(HIGH estimate). It is the high estimate 
of the percentage reduction in time 
(Table 14, Column II) times the annual 
cost per physicians of interacting with 
health plans (Table 14, Column III). 
Table 14, Column VII is the low and 
high estimated savings for all physician 
offices if their interaction with health 
plans is reduced by 15 to 30 minutes a 
week. Table 14, Column VII is the cost 
avoidance per year per physician (Table 
14, Column IV and V) times the number 
of physicians (Table 14, Column VI). 
The number of physicians was 
calculated by taking the average of the 
projected supply of physicians in 
physician practices and the projected 
demand for physicians in physician 
practices as calculated in ‘‘Physician 
Shortages to Worsen Without Increases 
in Residency Training,’’ a summary of 
an analysis by the Association of 
American Medical Colleges.42 
Based on our calculations, we 
anticipate that the time physicians in 
physician practices will spend per week 
interacting with health plans will 
decrease. Due to a lack of baseline data 
regarding other providers and 
physicians working in hospitals, our 
calculations do not reflect a similar 
anticipated decrease in time for other 
providers and physicians working in 
hospitals. We assume, though, that 
hospitals, because they typically 
consolidate their billing functions, will 
have analogous savings to physicians in 
physician practices, albeit less on a ‘‘per 
physician’’ basis.

b. Increase in Three Transactions 
The second area of savings for 
providers is the per transaction savings 
of moving from non-electronic to 
electronic transactions. We used the 
same assumptions on the number and 
rate of increase of three electronic 
transactions methodology as illustrated 
for health plans in Table 12. However, 
the savings per transaction for health 
care providers differ from the savings 
that health plans will realize, as 
reflected in Table 15. For a more 
detailed description of how we arrived 
at the savings associated with the 
eligibility for a health plan transaction 
and the health care claim status 
transaction, see the RIA in the 
‘‘Administrative Simplification: 
Adoption of Operating Rules for 
Eligibility for a Health Plan and Health 
Care Claim Status Transactions,’’ 
published in the July 8, 2011 Federal 
Register (76 FR 40471). The estimated 
savings associated with the health care 
payment and remittance advice 
transaction were taken from the 
‘‘National Progress Report on Healthcare 
Efficiency: 2010’’ at 
www.ushealthcareindex.com.

Table 16 reflects the same assumption 
that use of the HPID will lead to 
increased use of three electronic 
transactions. We estimate an annual 
increase of 1 (LOW) to 2 (HIGH) percent 
in the use of the eligibility for a health 
plan transaction and the health care 
claim status transaction attributable to 
implementation of the HPID over the 
next 10 years as illustrated in Table 15. 
We estimate an annual increase of 1 
(LOW) to 3 (HIGH) percent in the use of 
the electronic health care payment and 
remittance advice transaction (in the 
health care electronic funds transfers 
(EFT) remittance advice transaction). 
The savings in each column are a 
product of the number increase in each 
transaction, with high and low ranges, 
multiplied by the cost savings of each 
move to an electronic transaction 
detailed in Table 15.

To summarize health care provider 
savings, providers can expect savings 
from two indirect consequences of the 
implementation of a health plan 
identifier, as demonstrated in Table 17: 
the cost avoidance of a decrease in 
administrative time spent by physician 
practices interacting with health plans, 
and a cost savings for physician 
practices and hospitals for every 
transaction that moves from a manual 
transaction to an electronic transaction.

c. Savings to Transaction and Software 
Vendors and Health Care 
Clearinghouses 
None of the studies considered for 
this analysis was able to quantify the 
costs and savings, or the return on 
investment of adopting the HPID for 
software vendors and health care 
clearinghouses. As noted previously, we 
expect that some indirect costs will be 
borne by health care providers in the 
form of increased fees from transaction 
vendors and health care clearinghouses 
such as upgraded software costs and an 
increase in volume of claims 
transactions.

We anticipate that the savings, as well 
as the costs, to software vendors of 
upgrading health care provider software 
will be passed along to their provider 
clients. We therefore assume that the 
return on investment for software 
vendors in implementing the operating 
rules reflected in our estimates as those 
for health care providers. 
Additionally, since health care 
clearinghouses work on behalf of health 
plans and act as intermediaries between 
health care providers and health plans 
in regard to electronic transactions, we 
believe that the savings, as well as the 
costs, to health care clearinghouses will 
be the same savings and costs as those 
expected by health plans.

J. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis the 
HPID and NPI 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
of 1980 (Pub. L. 96–354) requires 
agencies to describe and analyze the 
impact of the proposed rule on small 
entities unless the Secretary can certify 
that the regulation will not have a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. According to 
the Small Business Administration’s 
size standards, a small entity is defined 
as follows according to health care 
categories: Offices of Physicians are 
defined as small entities if they have 
revenues of $10 million or less; most 
other health care providers (dentists, 
chiropractors, optometrists, mental 
health specialists) are small entities if 
they have revenues of $7 million or less; 
hospitals are small entities if they have 
revenues of $34.5 million or less. (For 
details, see the SBA’s Web site at http:// 
www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/Size_
Standards_Table.pdf. Refer to Sector 
62—Health Care and Social Assistance). 
For purposes of this analysis 
(pursuant to the RFA), nonprofit 
organizations are considered small 
entities; however, individuals and 
States are not included in the definition 
of a small entity. In the following 
discussion, we have attempted to 
estimate the number of small entities 
and provide a general discussion of the 
effects of this proposed rule, and where 
we had difficulty or were unable to find 
information, we solicit industry 
comment. 
1. Number of Small Entities and Scope 
of Analysis 
a. Individual ‘‘Prescribers’’ 
As detailed in section IV.B. of this 
proposed rule, the addition to the 
requirements for the NPI will impose a 
time cost to prescribers in terms of 
applying for an NPI. These individual 
prescribers are members of an 
organization, or are employed, 
subcontracted, or given clinical 
privileges by an organization. We 
assume the majority of these prescribers 
cannot be defined as small entities, 
because they are individuals, not legal 
businesses. A small number of 
prescribers are sole proprietors 43 and 
may be considered small business 
entities under the RFA. However, the 
only cost to prescribers is the cost to 
obtain an NPI and therefore does not 
represent a substantive impact. 
Therefore, we will not be including the 
impact to individual prescribers in this 
analysis. We request industry feedback 
on this assumption. 
b. Health Care Providers: Physician 
Practices and Hospitals 
As with our RIA for the HPID, in the 
category of health care providers, we 
analyzed physician practices and 
hospitals only in terms of how they will 
be impacted by implementation and use 
of the HPID. (There will be no analysis 
of the impact to physician practices or 
hospitals with regard to the addition to 
the NPI requirements for the reasons 
described previously.) We did not 
analyze the impact to nursing and 
residential care facilities, dentists, or 
suppliers of durable medical equipment. 
We narrowed our analysis to 
physician practices and hospitals for 
two reasons: (1) We have very little data 
on the usage of EDI among dentists, 
suppliers of durable medical equipment, 
nursing homes, and residential care 
facilities. The lack of data for these 
types of health care providers have been 
noted in other studies on administrative 
simplification;44 and (2) we assume that 
the greatest costs will be borne by 
hospitals and physician practices as 
they conduct the majority of standard 
transactions. While we believe that 
some small health care provider entities 
outside of these two categories may be 
impacted, albeit in much fewer 
numbers, we believe the analysis 
gathered here would be indicative of the 
costs that we would expect all small 
health care provider entities to 
experience. We welcome comment from 
industry and the public as to our 
assumptions. 
Because each hospital maintains its 
own financial records and reports 
separately to payment plans, we 
decided to report the number of 
establishments rather than firms. For 
physician practices, we assumed that 
the costs to implement the HPID would 
be accounted for at the level of firms 
rather than at the individual 
establishments.

22988 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
Detailed Statistics, 2007 Economic 
Census, there are approximately 220,100 
physician practices. The U.S. Census 
Bureau data indicates that two percent 
of physician practices have revenues of 
$10 million or more, therefore 
approximately 4,400 physician practices 
are not small entities. 
Nevertheless, we have decided to 
consider all physician practices small 
entities. Our basis for this is the fact that 
Census Bureau data is calculated from 
report forms that are sent to only a 
sample of small employers (less than 10 
employees). Therefore, we can assume 
that the estimates from the Census 
Bureau are low. The estimated number 
of physician practices in the 
Modifications proposed rule (234,222 
physician practices) includes physician 
practices with one to two physicians 
and is within 6 percent of the total 
number of physician practices estimated 
by the Census Bureau. Therefore, we 
will assume that all physician practices, 
as calculated by the Census Bureau 
(220,100), are small entities, and accept 
a small margin of error. 
The 2007 Census Bureau reports that 
there are approximately 6,500 hospitals. 
The data indicates that 85 percent of 
hospitals have sales/receipts/revenues 
of $10 million or more. While we can 
assume that, of those 85 percent, some 
have revenues over $34.5 million; we do 
not have specific numbers that detail 
this assumption. Therefore, as with 
physician practices, we will make 
calculations on the assumption that all 
hospitals are small entities. 
c. Health Care Clearinghouses and 
Transaction Vendors 
We did not calculate costs and 
benefits to health care clearinghouses 
and transaction vendors in this RFA 
because we assume that any associated 
costs and benefits will be passed on to 
the health plans or health care 
providers, and will be included in the 
costs and benefits we apply to health 
plans and health care providers. 
d. Health Plans 
The health insurance industry was 
examined in depth in the RIA prepared 
for the proposed rule on establishment 
of the Medicare Advantage program (69 
FR 46866, August 3, 2004). It was 
determined, in that analysis, that there 
were few, if any, ‘‘insurance firms,’’ 
including HMOs that fell below the size 
thresholds for ‘‘small’’ business 
established by the SBA Health. We 
assume that the ‘‘insurance firms’’ are 
synonymous, for the most part, with 
health plans that conduct standard 
transactions with other covered entities 
and are, therefore, the entities that will 
have costs implementing the use of 
HPIDs. In fact, then, and even more so 
now, the market for health insurance is 
dominated by a relative handful of firms 
with substantial market shares. There 
are, however, a number of health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs) that 
are small entities by virtue of their 
nonprofit status even though few if any 
of them are small by SBA size 
standards. There are approximately 100 
such HMOs. These HMOs and those 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans that 
are non-profit organizations, like the 
other firms affected by this proposed 
rule, will be required to obtain and use 
HPID in standard transactions. 
Accordingly, this proposed rule will 
affect a ‘‘substantial number’’ of small 
entities. We estimate, however, that the 
costs of this proposed rule on health 
plans do not remotely approach the 
amounts necessary to be a ‘‘significant 
economic impact’’ on firms with 
revenues of tens of millions of dollars. 
Therefore, we do not include health 
plans in our RFA, but have analyzed the 
costs and benefits to health plans in our 
RIA. 
We welcome industry and stakeholder 
input on our assumption in this regard. 
2. Cost for Small Entities 
In Table 19, we take the information 
from the impact analysis and break out 
the costs for both physician practices 
and hospitals, using the maximum cost 
of implementation in any one year. As 
we are treating all health care hospitals 
and physician practices as small entities 
for the purpose of this RFA, we 
allocated 100 percent of the 
implementation costs reported in the 
impact analysis for physician practices 
and hospitals. We used the maximum 
estimated costs from the RIA. Table 19 
shows the impact of the implementation 
costs of HPID as a percent of the health 
care provider revenues.

shows the costs to health care providers 
for implementation of the HPID, as 
described in the RIA. The estimated 
high range of costs was used. Table 19, 
Column V shows the percent of the 
small entity share of implementation 
costs as a percent of the small entity 
revenues. 
K. Conclusion for the HPID and NPI 
We use a baseline threshold of 3 
percent of revenues to determine if a 
rule would have a significant economic 
impact on affected small entities. The 
anticipated economic effect of this rule 
on small entities would not exceed or 
even come close to meeting this 
threshold. Based on the foregoing 
analysis, we certify that this proposed 
rule would not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
However, because of the relative 
uncertainty in the data, the lack of 
consistent industry data, and our 
general assumptions, we invite public 
comments on the analysis and request 
any additional data that would help us 
determine more accurately the impact 
on the various categories of small 
entities affected by this proposed rule.

L. Alternatives Considered for the ICD– 
10 
Faced with growing evidence that a 
group of providers would not be ready 
for the transition to ICD–10, and the 
possibility that payment for millions of 
health care claims would be delayed, we 
considered a number of options before 
proposing a 1-year delay in the 
compliance date in this proposed rule. 
1. Option 1: Maintain October 1, 2013 
Deadline 
Segments of the health care industry 
have expressed strong support for 
staying the course regarding the 2013 
date. Many health plans, large hospitals, 
physician practices, and IT vendors 
have already made large investments 
upgrading systems, hiring personnel for 
the transition, and making other 
preparations for implementation. There 
is a financial and psychological 
momentum toward implementing ICD– 
10 that may be disrupted by a delay. 
According to the Edifecs poll, ‘‘a 
potential delay of the ICD–10 
compliance deadline could have far 
reaching—and highly negative—impact 
to the health care industry’s effort to 
implement the mandate.’’ 45 
A major health informatics 
association, citing the large investments 
that providers, health plans, academic 
programs, and others have made in 
creating new jobs, upgrading systems, 
deploying new EHR systems, and other 
efforts has urged no delay in the ICD– 
10 2013 compliance date.46 Likewise, 
due to the long lead time required for 
textbook development and publication, 
authors and educational institutions 
have already changed their textbooks 
and coding curricula to ICD–10. One 
university coding program has 
expressed concern that its 30 coding 
students would have to revert to 
learning ICD–9 codes and take 
additional classes to gain proficiency 
with ICD–9, at a cost of $2,036 per 
student, so that upon graduation they 
will be employable in an ICD–9 
environment should the compliance 
date for ICD–10 be delayed. Other 
institutions, such as medical schools 
that include coding as part of their 
curricula, technical and vocational 
schools, community colleges and other 
entities that offer coding training, would 
experience similar challenges with a 
delayed ICD–10 compliance date. 
Hospitals also report extensive ICD– 
10 financial investments in information 
technology systems re-programming, 
business process changes, and staff 
training premised upon the October 1, 
2013 compliance date. While a major 
hospital association has advocated 
retaining the October 1, 2013 
compliance date, it still welcomed a 
review of the date as a delay could 
benefit smaller hospitals with fewer 
resources to invest in ICD–10 
implementation.47 
Nevertheless, it is clear that a 
significant number of health care 
entities will not be prepared to meet the 
October 1, 2013 ICD–10 compliance 
date. Reasons for this vary—entities may 
not have altered their systems, 
thoroughly analyzed their processes, 
changed their forms, prepared for 
training their personnel, or begun 
testing their internal systems. 
Regardless of the reason entities will not 
be able to achieve compliance, given the 
substantial effect that delayed claim 
payments would have on health care 
delivery industry-wide, a delayed 
compliance date appears to be 
warranted. 
As demonstrated in the impact 
analysis in this proposed rule, we 
anticipate that a substantial number of 
small providers (medical practices of 
between 1 to 5 physicians), would not 
be ready to use ICD–10–CM codes by 
the October 1, 2013 compliance date. If 
25 percent of physician claims were to 
continue to be submitted using ICD–9 
codes after an October 1, 2013 
compliance date, millions of claims 
would likely be returned and physicians 
might experience devastating cash flow 
problems. Lack of reimbursement could 
force practices to shut down, making 
medical services inaccessible to patients 
and/or forcing physicians to ask patients 
to pay up front, out-of-pocket, for 
medical services, which, aside from 
being barred by the terms of some 
insurance programs, would be 
extraordinarily burdensome to patients. 
Although we believe that a majority of 
the health care industry supports 
maintaining the October 1, 2013 ICD–10 
compliance date and is justly concerned 
that the ill-preparedness of a minority of 
the industry might adversely affect its 
efforts to achieve timely compliance, as 
we stated in the January 2009 final rule, 
successful ICD–10 compliance is 
dependent on all industry segments 
being ready for ICD–10 at the same time. 
More importantly, we believe that 
concern for patient well-being and 
physicians’ continued rendering of 
health care services must be a prime 
consideration. We have determined that 
maintaining the October 1, 2013 ICD–10 
compliance date could disrupt 
significant numbers of physicians’ 
reimbursements, which in turn could 
jeopardize patient care. 
2. Option 2: Maintain the October 2013 
Compliance Date for ICD–10–PCS 
(Procedure Coding) and Delay the 
Compliance Date for ICD–10–CM 
Diagnosis Codes Only 
We also considered a split 
implementation alternative: Maintaining 
the compliance date for ICD–10–PCS, 
which is used for inpatient hospital 
procedure coding only, at October 1, 
2013, while delaying the compliance 
date for ICD–10–CM, the diagnosis 
codes used by physicians, to some later 
date, for example October 1, 2015. The 
rationale for this option was that 
hospitals, with their greater access to 
resources, would be in a better position 
to move forward with ICD–10–PCS, 
which would result in at least partial 
compliance with the October 1, 2013 
date. This option would also afford 
small providers additional time to 
become compliant with the ICD–10–CM 
diagnosis codes. 
However, after analysis, we discerned 
that this option held the potential for 
penalizing hospitals in that they would 
effectively have to implement ICD–10 
twice: Once in 2013 for ICD–10–PCS 
and then again in 2015 for ICD–10–CM, 
increasing their implementation costs. 
This option also held great potential for 
confusion among providers and payers. 
3. Option 3: Forgo ICD–10 and Wait for 
ICD–11 
The option of foregoing a transition 
from ICD–9 to ICD–10, and instead 
waiting for ICD–11, was another 
alternative that was considered. This 
option was eliminated from 
consideration because the World Health 
Organization, which creates the basic 
version of the medical code set from 
which all countries create their own 
specialized versions, is not expected to 
release the basic ICD–11 medical code 
set until 2015 at the earliest. 
From the time of that release, subject 
matter experts state that the transition 
from ICD–9 directly to ICD–11 would be 
more difficult for industry and it would 
take anywhere from 5 to 7 years for the 
United States to develop its own ICD– 
11–CM and ICD–11–PCS versions.48

Letter In Regards to ICD–10, Implementation Date 
Delay to Denise M. Buenning, Director, 
Administrative Simplification Group, Office of E– 
Health Standards and Services (OESS), from Maria 
Buonos, Business Development Manager, Wolters 
Kluwar Law & Business. 
4. Option 4: Mandate a Uniform Delay 
in Compliance Date for ICD–10 
The fourth option considered was a 
uniform delay in the compliance date 
for both ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS. 
The advantage to contemplating an 
across-the-board delay was that it would 
yield a single compliance date among 
all industry segments. Contemplating 
such an option gave rise to a secondary 
question—what length of delay would 
be appropriate? 
Using the existing October 1, 2013 
compliance date as a starting point, we 
looked at the potential impact of 
delaying compliance to October 1, 2015. 
While offering, in effect, an additional 
3-year implementation timeline (from 
2012 through 2015), a delay to 2015 
would have damaging effects on 
industry and on the transition to ICD– 
10 in general. The Edifecs poll found 
that nearly 70 percent of respondents 
felt that a two-year delay would be 
either ‘‘potentially catastrophic or cause 
an unrecoverable failure,’’ and that ‘‘a 
delay of longer than a year will likely 
freeze budgets, slow down schedules, or 
stop work altogether.’’ 49 A mere 2 
percent of Edifecs respondents said 
there would be a benefit to a 2-year 
delay. Entities’ difficulties would likely 
include having to modify their 
preparation now (likely through actions 
like staff layoffs or terminating 
contracts), only to have to hire other 
staff or enter into new or revised 
contracts later. 
Based upon the methodology and 
baseline estimates from the RIA that 
follows, we estimate it will cost health 
plans up to an additional 30 percent of 
their current ICD–10 implementation 
budgets for a 1-year delay. We can 
assume, therefore, that a 2-year delay 
would be at least double the cost; that 
is, a 2-year delay would cost at least $13 
billion for all commercial and 
government health plans. 
An informal survey of State Medicaid 
programs also indicated that an October 
1, 2015 compliance date may be 
problematic for some States that are 
undergoing IT-intensive Medicaid 
Management Information System 
(MMIS) transitions that same year. 
Extending the ICD–10 compliance 
date to October 1, 2015 would likely 
result in having to lift the current code 
set freeze, as the industry could not wait 
an additional 2 years for maintenance 
updates to the medical data code sets. 
A code set freeze is a suspension of 
updates to code sets, in this case, ICD– 
9. Updates to code sets are usually 
necessary on an annual basis in order to 
encompass new diagnosis and 
procedure codes that capture new 
technologies or diseases. The ICD–9–CM 
Coordination and Maintenance 
Committee implemented a partial code 
set freeze of the ICD–9–CM and ICD–10 
codes prior to the October 1, 2013 ICD– 
10 compliance deadline. On October 1, 
2012, there will be only limited code 
updates to both the ICD–9–CM and ICD– 
10 code sets to capture new 
technologies and diseases as required by 
section 503(a) of Pub. L. 108–173. On 
October 1, 2013, there will be only 
limited code updates to ICD–10 code 
sets to capture new technologies and 
diagnoses as required by that same 
provision, while no updates will be 
made to the then-obsolete ICD–9–CM. 
On October 1, 2014, regular updates to 
ICD–10 will begin. For more 
information on the code set freeze, see 
http://www.cms.gov/ 
ICD9ProviderDiagnosticCodes/ 
Downloads/Partial_Code_Freeze.pdf. 
Lifting the code set freeze would 
result in the release of potentially 
thousands of changes to the ICD–10–CM 
and ICD–10–PCS code sets, all of which 
would have to be re-programmed into 
systems in order to be ready for an 
October 1, 2015 compliance date, at 
considerable industry cost. The 
Medicare fee-for-service health plan 
estimated that the cost for re- 
programming just one of its systems due 
to a code set freeze lift would result in, 
at minimum, $1 million in additional 
expense. If each of the nation’s 
approximately 1,887 health plans 
incurred a similar cost, it would 
translate into a minimum additional 
expense of nearly $2 billion. 
A 2-year delay in the ICD–10 
compliance date may also signal a lack 
of HHS’ ICD–10 commitment, 
potentially engendering industry fear 
that there could be another delay in, or 
complete abandonment of, ICD–10 
implementation, with subsequent heavy 
financial losses attributable to ICD–10 
investments already made. Industry 
representatives also expressed concern 
about the loss of momentum in progress 
toward ICD–10 compliance that would 
result from a 2-year compliance 
extension.50 
5. Conclusion 
We believe a 1-year delay in 
compliance with ICD–10–CM and ICD– 
10–PCS achieves a balance between the 
needs of those who have already taken 
the initiative to plan for on-time 
compliance with ICD–10 and the need 
for small providers and small hospitals 
to have additional time to become ICD– 
10 compliant. While not without 
additional costs, a 1-year delay to 
October 1, 2014 represents what we 
consider to be a reasonable compromise. 
Short of maintaining the 2013 date, 
delaying ICD–10–CM and ICD–10–PCS 
by 1-year does the least to disrupt 
existing implementation efforts, while 
affording the small provider community 
an additional year to become compliant. 
A 1-year delay does not significantly 
penalize those that have made 
significant investments to become 
prepared to implement ICD–10 and 
better maintains momentum than would 
a 2-year delay. 
Any ICD–10 delay decision must be 
accompanied by increased industry and 
Departmental efforts, including further 
outreach and education, and joint pilot 
testing, to ensure that small providers 
and hospitals achieve compliance. 
Additionally, a 1-year delay means that 
the current code freeze—which was not 
contemplated in either the ICD–10 
proposed or final rules—could be 
maintained, avoiding costly systems 
reprogramming. Finally, as opposed to 
the likely significant impact of a 
possible 2-year delay, a 1-year delay 
allows the industry to maintain 
momentum already achieved in 
readying for the current October 1, 2013 
compliance date. 
We invite industry and stakeholder 
comment on all of our ICD–10 
compliance date alternatives and 
assumptions. 
M. Impacted Entities—ICD–10 
All covered entities may be affected 
by a delay in the compliance date of 
ICD–10 as proposed in this rule. 
Covered entities include all health 
plans, health care clearinghouses, and 
health care providers that transmit 
health information in electronic form in 
connection with a transaction for which 
the Secretary has adopted a standard. 
Table 7 outlines the number of 
covered entities that may be affected by 
a delay in ICD–10, along with the 
sources of those data. These are the 
same entities that will be affected by 
HPID. 
While covered entities are required to 
transition to ICD–10, many other 
entities not required to abide by HIPAA 
(such as workers’ compensation

51 ‘‘Excess Billing and Insurance-Related 
Administrative Costs,’’ by James Kahn, in The 
Healthcare Imperative; Lowering Costs and 
Improving Outcomes: Workshop Series Summary, 
edited by Pierre L. Yong, Robert S. Saunders, and 
Leigh Anne Olsen, Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academies, the National Academies Press,

programs and automobile and personal 
liability insurers) currently use ICD–9 
for a variety of purposes. Because their 
operational and business needs often 
intersect with covered entities, for 
practical and business purposes these 
other entities may voluntarily transition 
to ICD–10 alongside HIPAA covered 
entities. ICD codes are used in nearly 
every sector of the medical and health 
industry. 
N. Scope and Methodology of the 
Impact Analysis for ICD–10 
This impact analysis estimates the 
costs and benefits of a proposed delay 
in required compliance with ICD–10. 
We are analyzing only the impact of a 
delay, not the impact of ICD–10 
implementation that we addressed in 
the August 2008 ICD–10 proposed rule 
(73 FR 49476) and the January 2009 
ICD–10 final rule (74 FR 3328). 
Despite the broad utilization of ICD 
codes that extends beyond covered 
entities, with one exception our analysis 
is restricted only to those entities as 
only they fall under the auspices of this 
rule. With respect to health care 
providers, only health care providers 
that transmit health information in 
electronic form in connection with a 
transaction for which the Secretary has 
adopted a HIPAA transaction standard 
are considered covered entities. The one 
area where we provide additional 
analysis is the cost to educational 
institutions to educate students being 
trained in ICD–10 coding because such 
training costs have been of particular 
concern to industry and have been 
included in the August 2008 and 
January 2009 ICD–10 proposed and final 
rules’ cost analyses. 
Moreover, while we assume that a 
delay in the implementation of ICD–10 
will affect a broad range of health care 
providers, as illustrated in Table 7, we 
only examine the costs and benefits of 
a delay on two types of health care 
providers: Hospitals and physician 
practices. We do not analyze the impact 
on other industry sectors, including, but 
not limited to, nursing and residential 
care facilities, dentists, durable medical 
equipment (DME) suppliers, or 
pharmacies for various reasons. 
Consistent with our previous impact 
analysis in the 2008 ICD–10 proposed 
rule, we continue to have very little data 
on the use of EDI among dentists, DME 
suppliers, nursing homes, and 
residential care facilities. The lack of 
data for these types of health care 
providers has been noted in other 
studies on administrative 
simplification.51 We assume that the 
greatest benefits will be gained by 
hospitals and physician practices as 
they conduct the majority of standard 
transactions, although it cannot be 
assumed that the costs will necessarily 
be borne by physician practices and 
hospitals only. We have not included an 
analysis of the impact on pharmacies 
because pharmacies typically do not use 
ICD codes in their routine course of 
business so we assume there is no 
impact on pharmacies. We welcome 
comment regarding our assumptions. 
We include health care 
clearinghouses and transaction vendors 
as affected entities in Table 7. 
Transaction vendors are entities that 
process claims or payments for other 
entities such as health plans. 
Transaction vendors may not meet the 
HIPAA definition of health care 
clearinghouse, but, as used in this 
context, health care clearinghouses 
would constitute a subset of transaction 
vendors. Payment vendors would be a 
type of transaction vendor—a 
transaction vendor that ‘‘associates’’ or 
‘‘reassociates’’ health care claim 
payments with the payments’ 
remittance advice for either a health 
plan or provider. For our purposes, 
transaction vendors do not include 
developers or retailers of computer 
software, or entities that are involved in 
installing, programming or maintaining 
computer software. Health care 
clearinghouses and transaction vendors 
will be impacted because they will need 
to transition their systems to accept 
ICD–10 codes. However, we did not 
calculate costs and benefits to health 
care clearinghouses and transaction 
vendors in this cost analysis because, as 
in our previous impact analysis in the 
August 2008 ICD–10 proposed rule, we 
assume that any associated costs and 
benefits will be passed on to the health 
plans or providers and will be included 
in the costs and benefits we apply to 
health plans or providers. 
Although self-insured group health 
plans meet the HIPAA definition of 
‘‘health plan,’’ we did not include them 
in this impact analysis. While self- 
insured group health plans will be 
required implement ICD–10, we assume 
that, with a few exceptions, such plans 
do not send or receive HIPAA electronic 
transactions because most are not 
involved in the day-to-day activities of 
a health plan and outsource those 
services to TPAs or transaction vendors. 
However, we do include TPAs in this 
RIA. Although TPAs do not meet the 
definition of ‘‘health plans’’ and 
therefore are not required by HIPAA to 
use code sets such as ICD–10, as a 
practical matter they will be required to 
make the transition in order to continue 
to conduct electronic transactions on 
the part of self-insured plans. However, 
the impact of a delay of the compliance 
date of ICD–10 on TPAs will be similar 
to the commercial insurer cost/benefit 
impact profile since they serve a similar 
function and will have to implement 
and test their systems in the same 
manner as health plans. Therefore, 
when we refer to ‘‘commercial health 
plans’’ in this RIA we will be including 
TPAs, and we include all TPAs in the 
category of ‘‘small health plans’’ in the 
RFA. 
Software vendors will incur 
considerable responsibility and cost 
with respect to ICD–10 implementation, 
but we do not analyze the cost of delay 
to software vendors as they ultimately 
pass their costs to their clients. 
O. Cost Avoidance of a 1-Year Delay in 
the ICD–10 for the Health Care Industry 
Our analysis of industry benefit is 
based on cost avoidance. That is, we 
anticipate that there will be greater costs 
associated with the current compliance 
date for ICD–10 of October 1, 2013 than 
if the compliance date were to be 
delayed 1 year, as proposed in this rule. 
Therefore, our analysis will demonstrate 
the costs associated with the current 
compliance date of October 2013, and 
apply those as savings or benefits 
attributable to a delayed compliance 
date. 
The assumption behind these savings 
is that a specific number of physicians 
and hospitals will not be prepared to 
use ICD–10 by the compliance date of 
October 1, 2013. This lack of readiness 
would engender a number of costly 
consequences. 
Estimates on the benefit of a 1-year 
delay are subject to considerable 
variation. A delay in the ICD–10 
compliance date increases the 
opportunity for a successful, timely 
transition and provides an opportunity 
to reduce disruptions in health care 
delivery and payment. A basic 
assumption in this projection of a 
benefit is that entities will take the 1- 
year delay to become compliant and to 
conduct robust testing as discussed 
previously. This is possible, but by no 
means inevitable, even if a vigorous 
public/private campaign is undertaken 
to promote and assist with compliance 
and testing.

53 Differences among provider subgroup 
categories are reported in the CMS Readiness 
Survey; however, for many questions and response 
options, the base sizes of respondents are too small 
to be eligibility for significance testing. 
In order to make these projections on 
cost avoidance, we must first estimate 
the number of physicians and hospitals 
that we expect will not be capable of 
successfully making the transition to 
ICD–10 on October 1, 2013 such that 
that their claims would be rejected or 
returned by health plans. We base our 
assumptions on CMS’ recent assessment 
survey. The survey was an assessment 
of health care providers, payers, and 
vendors to determine their awareness of 
and preparation for the transitions to 
ICD–10 and Version 5010. The research 
was conducted November 1 through 
December 5, 2011. Table 20 illustrates 
the number of survey participants from 
the specific health care entity:

trators and health care practice managers

Total: 404 providers .................................... 101 payers ....................................................... 90 Vendors 
The questions in the survey were 
aimed at assessing the entities’ self- 
reported readiness. We believe the 
question of compliance by October 1, 
2013 is a good baseline from which to 
draw estimates, specifically with regard 
to providers, approximately a quarter of 
whom stated that they will not be 
compliant by the October 1, 2013 
compliance date. In general, the survey 
found no significant differences in the 
responses based on the size or type of 
provider, payer or vendor.52 Table 21 
illustrates the self-reported assessments 
of readiness for ICD–10 among 
providers and the other sectors. Refer to

This RIA will base the benefits of the 
proposed delay of the compliance date 
of ICD–10 on cost avoidance, as 
opposed to an actual financial savings 
or cost savings. That is, we are 
proposing that, by delaying the 
compliance date by 1 year, a number of 
costly, predicted consequences will be 
avoided. Therefore, we use the survey 
results from providers as our baseline 
for estimating the issues that may arise 
if the compliance date remains October 
1, 2013. The providers must first code 
and initiate transactions with ICD–10. 
Ultimately, the costs of 
noncompliance—returned unpaid 
claims—will be borne by the providers. 
Based on the CMS readiness survey, 
we will use the percentage of providers 
who believed they would not be 
compliant by October 1, 2013 (26 
percent) as our high estimate and the 
percentage of providers who believed 
they would not be compliant by 
December 31, 2013 (12 percent) as our 
low estimate. We use 12 percent as the 
low estimate because that percentage 
seems to indicate that only 12 percent 
of providers believe they will miss the 
compliance date by more than 3 
months. It is reasonable to assume that, 
with some tools and careful planning, 
some to all of the 14 percent of 
providers that believe they are within 3 
months of making the October 1, 2013 
could be assisted in meeting the 
compliance date. Therefore, we estimate 
that 12 to 26 percent of providers will 
not have achieved ‘‘readiness’’ by the 
October 1, 2013 compliance date. 
We recognize that the providers that 
were surveyed in the CMS readiness 
survey do not represent all the various 
categories of providers, and did not 
include, for example: dentists, 
chiropractors, optometrists, mental 
health practitioners, substance use 
treatment practitioners, speech and 
physical therapists, podiatrists, home 
health care services, other ambulatory 
health care services, resale of health 
care and social assistance merchandise 
(durable medical equipment), and 
nursing and residential care facilities 
not associated with a hospital. However, 
as the survey did not find significant 
differences 53 between the categories of 
providers surveyed, we will assume that 
the providers in the categories that were 
not surveyed would have similar 
experience with October 2013 readiness 
for ICD–10. Further, physician practices 
and hospitals submit the bulk of total

health care claims. Therefore, we have 
based our estimates of the cost of not 
delaying the compliance date of ICD–10 
on the projection that 12 to 26 percent 
of providers will not be ready or will 
not have appropriately tested for 
implementation of ICD–10 by October 1, 
2013. 
We also recognize that the survey 
does not represent a statistically valid 
sample of providers, but we have no 
other recent data with which to base our 
readiness estimates. We welcome 
industry input and comment on our 
assumptions with regard to the 
readiness of covered entities. 
The total savings attributable to the 1- 
year compliance date delay is based on 
the premise that providers who are not 
ready for ICD–10 will submit claims to 
payers that will be automatically 
returned beginning on the October 1, 
2013 compliance date. Providers will 
then have to manually crosswalk ICD– 
9 to ICD–10 codes and ostensibly submit 
paper claims. (Alternately, providers 
who have not readied their systems or 
processes may proactively submit paper 
claims using ICD–10 on October 1, 2013. 
We assume that the cost to these 
providers to manually crosswalk will 
entail similar costs to what would be 
required to resubmit returned claims, as 
the manual task will be similar in 
nature.) We calculate the cost avoidance 
of a 1-year delay in the compliance date 
of ICD–10 based on two probable 
scenarios: Returned claims will: (1) 
Cause expensive manual intervention 
on the part of both providers and health 
plans in order for the ‘‘not ready’’ 
providers to be paid; and (2) financially 
impact providers by potentially 
requiring them to take out loans or 
apply for lines of credit to be able to 
continue to provide health care in the 
face of delayed payments. We apply 
calculations to each of these scenarios 
in the analysis that follows. Although 
the cost to manually process returned 
claims will ostensibly occur from, 
roughly, October 1, 2013 through 
March, 2014, for simplicity sake our 
calculations reflect a cost avoidance that 
is calculated for 1 year only—the year 
2014. 
A halt to the payment process for 12 
to 26 percent of all providers has a 
greater effect than requiring manual 
intervention and requiring business 
loans or lines of credit. In some cases, 
a payment delay may pose a serious 
threat to the continued operation of 
some providers. For example, many 
health care safety net clinics operate 
with no more than 30 to 60 days of cash 
on hand, so any prolonged delay would 
threaten such entities’ viability. 
We also anticipate that health care 
services for a great number of patients 
will be adversely affected or interrupted 
because providers will need to spend 
more time to obtain health care claim 
payments leaving less time to render 
health care services. 
1. Cost Avoidance: Manual Processing 
of Returned Claims 
Using the estimate of 12 to 26 percent 
of providers who will not be ICD–10 
compliant on October 1, 2013, we have 
calculated that 58 to 126 million claims 
per month will be returned as 
unprocessable across the industry. We 
have estimated the cost of returned 
claims for health plans and for 
physician practices and hospitals that 
would follow the implementation of 
ICD–10 in Table 22, assuming that 
providers could not electronically 
transmit claims with ICD–10 codes for 
6 months past an October 1, 2013 
compliance date. From this calculation, 
based on the following assumptions, we 
estimate the cost to the health care 
industry to manually process returned 
claims for 6 months after an October 1, 
2013 compliance date to be 
approximately $2 to $5 billion. This is 
based on the following assumptions: 
• The total number of health care 
claims in 2013 is projected to be 5.8 
billion. This is an average of the low 
and high range estimates of total claims 
as calculated in the Modifications 
proposed rule. 
• We use the percentage of providers 
that project they would not be 
compliant on October 1, 2013 to 
calculate the percentage of claims that 
will be returned (12 to 26 percent). This 
is a rough equivalency. However, the 
survey assessed both large and small 
physician offices and hospitals and 
found no significant difference in their 
readiness. As stated previously, we have 
projected the readiness of physician 
practices and hospitals, as estimated by 
the CMS readiness survey, as the 
readiness of all other providers 
(dentists, etc.). We believe the range of 
the estimate accounts for the great 
number of variables and unknowns 
inherent in this kind of calculation. 
• We use the cost of pended claims to 
calculate the cost to health plans of 
returned claims. Returned claims are 
claims that will be automatically 
returned by health plans because their 
systems will not be able to accept the 
ICD–9 codes that the non-compliant 
providers will submit. Returned claims, 
in and of themselves, have no cost to 
health plans. Pended claims are claims 
that require manual intervention by the 
health plan to be processed for payment. 
While we assume that 12 to 26 percent 
of all claims will be returned, we 
assume that these claims will be 
followed up by providers with calls or 
contacts with the health plans. 
Ultimately, it is probable that health 
plans will have to manually intervene 
with the claims submitted in ICD–9, and 
therefore the cost of these returned 
claims will be similar to the cost of 
pended claims for health plans. The cost 
to health plans for manually processing 
a pended claim is $2.30 per claim.54 
• According to the Medical Group 
Management Association (MGMA), the 
staff time required to manually process 
a returned claim is 15 minutes,55 at a 
cost of approximately $4.14 for labor, a 
factor derived from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics.56 This includes staff time 
spent to correct the error and resubmit 
claims that are returned. 
We are basing our estimates on the 
cost to manually process health care 
claims, both to the provider and to the 
health plan. However, it should be clear 
that these claims, so long as they are 
otherwise properly payable, would 
ultimately be paid. The impact to 
providers is not that they will lose 
money from claims altogether. Rather, it 
will take costly staff time for the 
providers to resubmit properly coded 
claims in order to receive payment, and 
it will take costly staff time for the 
health plan to manually process and pay 
the claims. We welcome comments on 
this analysis and these assumptions.

2. Cost Avoidance: Interest on Loans 
and Lines of Credit 
The time between when a provider 
originally submits the claim and when 
the provider finally gets paid will be 
considerably longer than if the claim 
were an electronically submitted 
‘‘clean’’ claim; that is., a claim for which 
no additional information or 
intervention is needed. During this time, 
providers, specifically small physician 
practices, will need to have cash on 
hand in order to ‘‘keep the doors open’’ 
by paying salaries, staying current with 
contract and lease obligations, 
purchasing equipment and medicines, 
and maintaining the physical plant. In 
some cases, in order to continue as a 
health care provider, this will require a 
business loan or a line of credit with 
interest. 
In Table 23, we estimate the costs in 
terms of interest if 12 to 26 percent of 
physician practices were required to 
take out a loan in order to continue to 
provide health care services. We use the 
following assumptions in the 
calculation: 
• Using data from the National Health 
Expenditures Projections 2010 to 2020, 
we calculate the average expenditure 
per physician practice.57 
• We assume that 12 to 26 percent of 
physician practices (or 28,107 to 60, 898 
providers who would not be ready for 
the ICD–10 transition) times the average 
expenditure per physician practice over 
half a year would be equal to the 
monetary amount in payments that 
would be delayed. 
• As per the most recent estimate by 
the Federal Reserve,58 we use 7.6 
percent as the average interest rate on a 
small business loan from $100,000 to $1 
million. 
Based on these assumptions, we 
estimate the cost avoidance for 
physician practices to be between $1.4 
to $3 billion if interest on loans to cover 
delayed payments were to accumulate 
over 6 months. Although these 
avoidable costs will ostensibly occur at 
the end of 2013 through 2014, for 
simplicity sake we have calculated the 
cost avoidance as occurring in 2014. 
For this calculation, we make no 
distinction between large or small 
physician practices, though we assume 
that the 12 to 26 percent of providers 
that may not be ready for the October 1, 
2013 compliance date are mostly small 
physician practices. Because we make 
no distinction between the size of 
physician practices, however, our cost 
avoidance may be high because we are 
basing our calculation on an average 
dollar amount per physician practice 
that will be delayed. It is likely that the 
average expenditure per physician 
practice is much higher than the actual 
expenditure per small physician 
practices. While there is a high level of 
uncertainty in terms of all of our 
assumptions, we think it illustrative to 
make the calculation in order to 
demonstrate the affect that a delay in 
payments will have on small physician 
practices. In this RIA, we only account 
for interest on loans taken out by the 12 
to 26 percent of providers that do not 
anticipate being compliant with ICD–10 
to cover delayed payments. We did not 
account for any possible interest 
accrued by payers that retain claim 
payments in our calculations, because 
we do not have sufficient information 
on the financing vehicles used by payers 
to pay claims. We welcome comments 
on our assumptions and calculations.

The cost of a 1-year delay falls on the

In summarizing its February 2012 poll, 
Edifecs noted that: 
‘‘Many entities have brought ICD–10 
subject matter experts on board with defined 
term contracts. A 1-year delay means entities 
will have to choose between two unpleasant 
scenarios: Either extend the contract or 
terminate the contract* * * Most entities 
will likely choose [to extend the contract] 
and retain the expertise they already have.

Many are also concerned about the added 
costs of maintaining technology resources, 
such as test regions, for an extended time 
period. Unfortunately, this means most 
organizations will incur a much greater cost 
to implement ICD–10 than originally 
anticipated.’’ 59 
1. Costs of a 1-Year Delay of 
Implementation of ICD–10 for Health 
Plans 
a. Cost for Commercial Health Plans and 
TPAs 
Health plans are a varied group in 
terms of size, and the cost of a delay is 
calculated using a range that reflects 
this variance. We assume that system 
costs for health plans to transition to 
ICD–10 have already been budgeted and 
funds already spent. A delay of a year 
for ICD–10 compliance primarily will 
allow entities more time to thoroughly 
test, but the testing and the continued 
maintenance of contracts and personnel 
required for the transition will be 1 year 
longer than was originally budgeted. In 
fact, one of the main issues for entities 
that argue against a delay is the concern 
that their companies would divert funds 
currently dedicated to the transition to 
ICD–10 to other priorities. 
We use the following assumptions in 
calculating the costs for health plans of 
a 1-year delay in the ICD–10 compliance 
date. 
• We assume that continued training, 
testing, and retention of personnel and 
contracts will cost plans an additional 
10 to 30 percent of what health plans 
have already budgeted on the ICD–10 
transition to date. We have based this 
range approximately on the Edifecs poll. 
The Edifecs poll found that, ‘‘Forty-nine 
percent estimated that every year of 
delay would increase their required 
budget between 11 and 25 percent, 
while another 37 percent estimated the 
increase would be somewhere between 
26 and 50 percent.’’ 60 We summarize 
this by approximating that nearly 86 
percent of respondents of the Edifecs 
poll would agree that the cost of a 1-year 
delay is at least in the range of 10 to 30 
percent of currently budgeted 
implementation costs.61 
• We analyzed the costs that were 
estimated in studies by the HayGroup, 
Inc. (2006), 62 the Robert E. Nolan 
Company (2003) 63 the RAND 
Corporation (2004),64 and AHIP 
(2010).65 The estimates from the various 
studies on the costs to health plans are 
summarized in Table 24. These studies 
were authored before ICD–10 
implementation began. Since these 
studies, we have actual health plan 
costs dedicated to the transition to ICD– 
10. However, we used some of the 
calculations that those studies 
employed in order to project the 
experience of a few health plans to the 
larger universe of all health plans.

costs onto all the health plans. 
• As a baseline, we use the analysis 
of ICD–10 costs conducted by the 
HayGroup, Inc. on behalf of AHIP in 
2006. The HayGroup study analyzed the 
other ICD–10 cost studies that had been 
published up to that point and 
summarized their shared conclusions, 
including studies conducted by the 
Robert E. Nolan Company (2003) 66 and 
RAND Corporation (2004).67 The 
HayGroup estimated implementation of 
ICD–10 would cost national health 
insurers between $324 to $748 million, 
plus about 20 percent more in training 
costs. (The HayGroup estimate was 
approximately the average of the Nolan 
and Rand estimates.) The HayGroup had 
a high estimate for national health plans 
of $25 million for implementation (plus 
an implied $5 million for training). 
Recently, however, national health 
plans have announced that their budgets 
for ICD–10 add up to nearly $100 
million.68 
In other words, the HayGroup high 
estimate appeared to be off by a factor 
of four in its projections. As illustrated 
in Table 25, we use $100 million as the 
high cost of implementing ICD–10 for 
national health plans, and $50 million 
as the low cost. This cost includes both 
system implementation and training. 
From that baseline, we have attributed 
costs for multi-regional, large, mid- 
sized, and small health plans, 
proportionate to the costs that are 
reflected in the HayGroup estimate. 
• We calculate 10 to 30 percent of the 
total costs of health plans’ ICD–10 
system implementation and training as 
the range of costs for a 1-year delay. 
• For simplicity sake, we have 
calculated all costs as if they occurred 
in the calendar year 2014. 
Health plans made and continue to 
make a large investment in preparing for 
ICD–10 based on the expectation that 
there would be a return on investment 
from the transition to a more robust 
code set. A 1-year delay in the 
compliance date of ICD–10 will also 
postpone the expected time when health 
plans can expect to see a return on these 
investments (ROI). This delay in ROI 
will likely have negative impacts on 
health plans in terms of their business 
plans, budgeting, and investor relations. 
Because of the uncertainties in 
predicting impacts of this sort, we have 
not attempted to quantify any impact 
resulting from a delay in ROI for health 
plans. We welcome industry comment 
or guidance on impacts of this category.

b. Cost of a One-Year Delay for CMS 
Health Plans 
The Medicare program reports that it 
is prepared to be ICD–10 compliant on 
October 1, 2013. CMS components 
affected by an ICD–10 transition delay 
estimate that there will be additional 
costs for extending contracts for systems 
programming and testing work and 
extended staff training and associated 
development costs. It is estimated that 
a 1-year delay in ICD–10 compliance 
would be reflected by additional work at 
an estimated total cost of $5 to $10 
million in addition to funding already 
requested for the coming fiscal years. 
c. Cost of a One-Year Delay in the 
Compliance Date of ICD–10 for State 
Medicaid Agencies 
State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) were 
queried informally during routine status 
update calls in February 2012 regarding 
potential mitigation strategies for ICD– 
10 implementation. Thirty-nine SMAs 
responded, representing all regions of 
the country from predominantly rural to 
densely populated States. We have 
extrapolated from these responses as 
best we could to present a quantitative 
assessment of costs and benefits. 
The responses were clearly split 
between 46 percent predicting more 
benefits than detriments to a delay in 
the compliance date of ICD–10 and 37 
percent indicated that any delay would 
prove more detrimental than beneficial 
to their transition to ICD–10. Another 10 
percent specifically indicated a delay of 
1 year would be preferred even though 
a 1 year delay was not a specific option 
they were asked to consider. Of the 46 
percent of States that indicated benefits 
to delay, many cited opportunities to 
improve testing and risk mitigation 
strategies. Another important benefit 
seen was the ability to spread out 
implementation costs over one or more 
additional fiscal years. A few indicated 
they would slow or even stop their 
existing efforts. 
Of the 37 percent of States reporting 
indicated any delay would be 
detrimental, most indicated additional 
costs associated with maintaining or 
sustaining ICD–10-related contracts and 
staff resources and potential risks for 
significant losses of momentum and 
funding. The 10 percent of SMAs 
opposed to a delay longer than 1 year 
expressed concerns that longer delays 
would put funding and the priority 
status of ICD–10 projects at risk. 
One predominantly rural SMA 
estimated that a 1-year delay could 
potentially result in a cost increase of 
over $4 million to their overall project. 
This increase would be due, primarily, 
to costs associated with maintaining 
contracts and the project staffs. 
Two SMAs specifically reported 
significant numbers of providers in the 
States that were lagging in preparation 
and planning. Additionally, they 
indicated the complications with the 
Version 5010 transition is resulting in 
less time and fewer resources available 
for ICD–10. Many of the resources that 
would have been working on ICD–10 
remediation were still committed to the 
Version 5010/D.0 implementation for 
both SMAs and many providers. 
We note that the types of concerns 
elicited by SMAs were very similar to 
those expressed in the Edifecs poll. The 
further along a SMA was in its 
implementation, the more likely it was 
to view a delay as being costly or 
burdensome and to characterize delays 
longer than a year as placing their 
conversion efforts at great risk for losses 
of funding and key resources. At the 
same time, many felt they could make 
good use of a 1 year delay to delay to 
improve the quality of their testing and 
risk mitigation strategies. 
Those most supportive of delay were 
those SMAs with less mature projects 
and with few committed resources. 
In Table 26, we calculate the cost to 
SMAs of a 1-year delay in the 
compliance date of ICD–10. We use the 
following assumptions: 
• Based on the informal poll of 
SMAs, we assume that 37 percent or 20 
SMAs would be ready for the October 1, 
2013 compliance date. Therefore, the 
assumption is that 21 SMAs would be 
affected negatively by a delay. 
• We assume that $4 million is the 
low estimate for a cost increase, as 
exemplified by the rural State that 
provided that estimate, while $7 million 
is the high estimate for a cost increase, 
as reported by an SMA. The high 
estimate is derived from a SMA that 
anecdotally described its costs per year 
of delay. For simplicity sake, we have 
calculated all costs as occurring in 
calendar year 2014.

Physician Practices and Clinical Laboratories: A 
Report to the ICD–10 Coalition,’’ October 8, 2008, 
Nachimson Advisors, LLC. 
2. Cost of a 1-Year Delay for Providers 
We expect that many, if not most, 
hospitals and large provider 
organizations have already spent funds 
in preparation for the ICD–10 transition. 
As with health plans, any delay in 
compliance date will add costs because 
large providers must maintain the 
personnel and renegotiate contracts 
necessary to lengthen preparations an 
extra year. Likewise, large providers 
must maintain technological resources 
for an extra year. 
Although the expectation is that 
providers will conduct more robust and 
extensive testing than what may have 
been originally planned, to the extent 
possible we have not included any 
testing costs in our analysis of provider 
costs attributable to a 1-year delay. 
While continued maintenance of test 
regions and resources dedicated to 
testing will be costly with a 1-year 
delay, it is assumed that continued and 
more robust testing will make it more 
likely that there will be a decrease in 
costly post-production issues such as 
returned claims. Increased testing costs 
will theoretically translate to decreased 
post-production error costs, and, 
therefore, because there is significant 
potential for an offset of expense to 
savings, no costs or benefits will be 
attributed to an extra year of testing. 
Because the October 1, 2013 compliance 
date is more than a year out, it is likely 
that few small physician practices have 
invested a modest amount of money and 
resources into the implementation of 
and training for ICD–10, although they 
may have begun planning and budgeting 
for the transition and may have 
contracts in place with vendors to 
purchase tools to manage the transition. 
While we recognize that there will be 
costs, we assume that these costs are 
negligible and that the extra time to 
prepare for the transition, as will be 
possible with a 1 year compliance date 
delay, will be more beneficial than 
costly for small providers. Therefore, we 
will not include small providers (under 
50 physicians) in the cost analysis for 
providers. 
There is an expectation that a 1-year 
delay will give small providers more 
time to analyze their processes, change 
their forms, develop their super bills, 
negotiate with their vendors, and, most 
importantly, test before production. In 
fact, giving small providers more time to 
prepare is the main justification for the 
1-year delay. As with large providers, 
however, we will not attach any costs to 
these planning and testing activities 
since they have already been considered 
as costs for implementation of ICD–10 
in the January 2009 ICD–10 final rule. 
We use the following assumptions in 
calculating the costs for large providers 
of a 1-year delay, illustrated in Table 27: 
• We use the Edifecs poll as a guide 
in establishing a range of costs for a 
delay of 1 year in implementing ICD–10 
for providers. (A group of provider 
representatives participated in the 
survey.) We will use the ‘‘HIGH’’ and 
‘‘LOW’’ estimate that the Edifecs poll 
suggests itself in its narrative: A 1 year 
delay will cost 10 to 30 percent of the 
costs that providers have spent or have 
budgeted for ICD–10 transition. 
• We will use costs estimated by an 
October 2003 study by the Robert E. 
Nolan company commissioned by the 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Association.69 We employed this study, 
along with a March 2004 RAND study, 
in the IDC–10 proposed rule. We 
considered, as well, an October, 2008 
analysis on the impact of ICD–10 on 
physician practices and clinical 
laboratories by Nachimson Advisors, 
LLC.70 The Nachimson study, however, 
approached cost by examining three 
very specific provider environments (for 
instance, practices with 10 physicians) 
and included costs that would occur 
after the transition to ICD–10, such as 
increased documentation and claim 
inquiries. 
In general, the Nachimson study’s 
costs were less than the Nolan study 
estimates, but because it is difficult to 
extrapolate the Nachimson study’s 
conclusions to a meaningful cost 
estimate of a 1 year delay for all large 
providers, we have not used that study 
in this RIA. We have adjusted the Nolan 
study cost estimates to 2012 dollars. 
• The number of physician practices 
and their categorization by size is 
derived from the Modifications 
proposed rule. 
• The costs to physician practices and 
hospitals would probably be incurred 
during the year of the proposed delay in 
compliance date, from October 1, 2013 
to October 1, 2014. For simplicity sake, 
we have calculated all costs to 
physician practices and hospitals as 
occurring over one calendar year, 2014.

22998 Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 74 / Tuesday, April 17, 2012 / Proposed Rules 
Similar to health plans, we assume 
that hospitals and large physician 
practices have made, and continue to 
make, a large investment in preparing 
for ICD–10 based on the expectation that 
there would be a return on investment 
from the transition to a more robust 
code set. A 1 year delay in the 
compliance date of ICD–10 will also 
postpone the expected time when these 
entities can expect to see a return on 
these investments. This delay in ROI 
will likely have negative impacts on 
these large providers in terms of their 
business plans, budgeting, and investor 
relations. Because of the uncertainties in 
predicting impacts of this sort, we have 
not attempted to quantify any impact 
resulting from a delay in ROI. We 
welcome industry comment or guidance 
on impacts of this category. 
3. Cost of Delay to Students 
In the ICD–10 proposed rule, we 
presented an estimate of training costs 
to implementation of ICD–10. These 
training costs were calculated based on 
an estimated number of coders working 
in hospitals and ambulatory clinics and 
multiplying that number by a specific 
cost to train these coders. 
A delay in the implementation of 
ICD–10 will not substantially impact 
training costs because we assume that 
the training costs are already a part of 
any entity’s budget and a change in 
compliance date will not change the 
amount of training that is necessary. 
However, one consequence of a 1 year 
delay to ICD–10 will be the impact to 
students who are now studying to 
become coders. 
Using the experience of one 
university’s bachelor’s-level health 
information management program, 
students take the ICD coding course in 
the spring of their junior year. Students 
enrolling in Spring 2012 courses will 
graduate in May 2013. Anticipating the 
October 1, 2013 compliance date, the 
university started offering ICD–10 
courses this spring in place of ICD–9 
with the understanding that it will be 
preparing students for employment after 
graduating in 2013. If ICD–10 is delayed 
a year, as proposed in this rule, the 30 
students in the program will have to 
take ICD 9 courses in addition to their 
ICD–10 courses in order to obtain the 
ICD 9 competencies to get jobs. The 
extra course will cost each of the 30 
students approximately $2,000 (in-state 
tuition) or a total of $61,000. 
Taking the university experience, we 
have projected these costs on to 
students in college and university 
coding curriculum nationwide. We have 
illustrated our estimates in Table 28 and 
calculated all costs as occurring in 2014. 
Although the impact on students is 
small when compared to the cost for 
health plans, this impact illustrates 
some of the practical consequences of 
delay that will affect lives beyond the 
health care financial impacts.

Q. Summary for ICD–10 
We summarize the low and high 
estimates of a 1-year delay in the 
compliance date for ICD–10 in Table 29. 
The total costs and cost avoidance of a 
proposed delay in the compliance date 
will likely be incurred over a 12 month 
period; however, due to the range in 
impacted entities, including educational 
institutions, those 12 months may span 
different dates and different budget 
periods. Further complicating the 
question of the timeframe in which the 
costs occur is the question of whether 
the cost should be calculated during the 
time it is incurred or in the budget 
period in which it is attributed. For 
instance, an educational institution may 
base its budget on a school year, 
September to August, while health 
plans and TPAs may base their budgets 
on calendar years or on varying fiscal 
years. Given the diversity of budgeting 
in the industry, there is no precise way 
of calculating how much of the cost and 
cost avoidance falls outside of the 
October 1, 2013 to October 1, 2014 
proposed delay in compliance date. For 
simplicity sake, we calculate all cost 
avoidance and costs of a delay in the 
compliance date for ICD–10 as occurring 
in the calendar year 2014. 
In Table 30, the net cost avoidance is 
illustrated with a— 
• Low net estimate that reflects the 
low estimate of cost avoidance less the 
high estimate of costs; 
• High net estimate that reflects the 
high estimate of cost avoidance less the 
low estimate of costs; and 
• Medium net cost avoidance that 
reflects the average cost avoidance less 
the average cost.

R. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis: 
Impact on Small Entities of a Delay in 
the Compliance Date of ICD–10 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
of 1980 (Pub. L. 96–354) requires 
agencies to describe and analyze the 
impact of the proposed rule on small 
entities unless the Secretary can certify 
that the regulation will not have a 
significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. According to 
the Small Business Administration’s 
size standards, a small entity is defined 
as follows according to health care 
categories: Offices of Physicians are 
defined as small entities if they have 
revenues of $10 million or less; most 
other health care providers (dentists, 
chiropractors, optometrists, mental 
health specialists) are small entities if 
they have revenues of $7 million or less; 
hospitals are small entities if they have 
revenues of $34.5 million or less. (For 
details, see the SBA’s Web site at 
http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/ 
Size_Standards_Table.pdf Refer to 
Sector 62—Health Care and Social 
Assistance). 
For purposes of this analysis 
(pursuant to the RFA), nonprofit 
organizations are considered small 
entities; however, individuals and 
States are not included in the definition 
of a small entity. In the following 
discussion, we have attempted to 
estimate the number of small entities 
and provide a general discussion of the 
effects of this proposed rule, and where 
we had difficulty or were unable to find 
information, we solicit industry 
comment. 
1. Number of Small Entities and Scope 
of Analysis 
a. Health Care Providers: Physician 
Practices and Hospitals 
As with the RIA on the delayed 
compliance date of ICD–10, in the 
category of health care providers, we 
analyzed physician practices and 
hospitals only in terms of how they will 
be impacted by a delay of 1 year in the 
compliance date of ICD–10. We did not 
analyze the impact to nursing and 
residential care facilities, dentists, or 
suppliers of durable medical equipment, 
nor did analyze the impact of 
implementation of ICD–10, as that 
analysis is provided in the RIA included 
in the ICD–10 proposed rule. 
We narrowed our analysis to 
physician practices and hospitals for 
two reasons: (1) We have very little data 
on the usage of EDI among dentists, 
suppliers of durable medical equipment, 
nursing homes, and residential care 
facilities. The lack of data for these 
types of health care providers have been 
noted in other studies on administrative 
simplification; 71 and (2) we assume that 
the greatest costs will be borne by 
hospitals and physician practices as 
they conduct the majority of standard 
transactions. While we believe that 
some small health care provider entities 
outside of these two categories may be 
impacted, albeit in much fewer 
numbers, we believe the analysis 
gathered here would be indicative of the 
costs that we would expect all small 
health care provider entities to 
experience. We welcome comment from 
industry and the public as to our 
assumptions. 
Because each hospital maintains its 
own financial records and reports 
separately to payment plans, we 
decided to report the number of 
establishments rather than firms. For 
physician practices, we assumed that 
the costs of a delay of the compliance 
date for ICD–10 would be accounted for 
at the level of firms rather than at the 
individual establishments. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
Detailed Statistics, 2007 Economic 
Census, there are approximately 220,100 
physician practices.. The U.S. Census 
Bureau data indicates that two percent 
of physician practices have revenues of 
$10 million or more, therefore 
approximately 4,400 physician practices 
are not small entities. 
Nevertheless, we have decided to 
consider all physician practices small 
entities. Our basis for this is the fact that 
Census Bureau data is calculated from 
report forms that are sent to only a 
sample of small employers (less than 10 
employees). Therefore, we can assume 
that the estimates from the Census 
Bureau are low. The estimated number 
of physician practices in the 
Modifications proposed rule (234,222 
physician practices) includes physician 
practices with one to two physicians 
and is within 6 percent of the total 
number of physician practices estimated 
by the Census Bureau. Therefore, we 
will assume that all physician practices, 
as calculated by the Census Bureau 
(220,100), are small entities, and accept 
a small margin of error. 
The 2007 Census Bureau reports that 
there are approximately 6,500 hospitals. 
The data indicates that 85 percent of 
hospitals have sales/receipts/revenues 
of $10 million or more. While we can 
assume that, of those 85 percent, some 
have revenues over $34.5 million; we do 
not have specific numbers that detail 
this assumption. Therefore, as with 
physician practices, we will make 
calculations on the assumption that all 
hospitals are small entities. 
b. Health Care Clearinghouses and 
Transaction Vendors 
We did not calculate costs and 
benefits to health care clearinghouses 
and transaction vendors in this 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis because 
we assume that any associated costs and 
benefits will be passed on to the health 
plans or health care providers, and will 
be included in the costs and benefits we 
apply to health plans and health care 
providers. 
c. Health Plans 
The health insurance industry was 
examined in depth in the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis prepared for the 
proposed rule on establishment of the 
Medicare Advantage program (69 FR 
46866, August 3, 2004). It was 
determined, in that analysis, that there 
were few if any ‘‘insurance firms,’’ 
including HMOs that fell below the size 
thresholds for ’’small’’ business 
established by the SBA Health. We 
assume that the ‘‘insurance firms’’ are 
synonymous, for the most part, with 
health plans who conduct standard 
transactions with other covered entities 
and are, therefore, the entities that will 
have costs associated with a delay of the 
compliance date for ICD–10. In fact, 
then, and even more so now, the market 
for health insurance is dominated by a 
relative handful of firms with 
substantial market shares. 
There are, however, a number of 
health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs) that are small entities by virtue 
of their nonprofit status even though 
few if any of them are small by SBA size 
standards. There are approximately 100 
such HMOs. These HMOs and those 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans that 
are non-profit organizations, like the 
other firms affected by this proposed 
rule, will be required to delay their 
implementation of ICD–10. Accordingly, 
this proposed rule will affect a 
‘‘substantial number’’ of small entities,

and we include the impact of a delay in 
the compliance date of ICD–10 for the 
100 HMOs and Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield plans in this RFA. 
We welcome industry and stakeholder 
input on our assumption in this regard. 
2. Cost for Providers 
We have applied the same 
methodology and assumptions as we 
applied in the RIA to arrive at estimates 
to impacts to small entities. For 
providers, as we stated previously in the 
RIA, there is a distinction between the 
costs and benefits for large providers, 
hospitals and large physician practices, 
and smaller physician practices. In 
general, our assumption is that the delay 
in the compliance date of ICD–10 will 
be more costly for large providers 
because many of them have already 
made substantial investments. The cost 
of implementing ICD–10, for all entities 
that have already invested funds and 
resources to that endeavor, will increase 
by a factor of 10 to 30 percent of the 
current cost. 
On the other hand, the justification 
for a delay in the compliance date of 
ICD–10 rests on the assumption that the 
delay will give many small providers 
more time to prepare for the transition. 
Therefore, our assumption is that there 
will be little to no cost for most small 
providers and that the cost avoidance of 
a delay will be high. 
Table 31 illustrates the estimated 
costs and benefits for providers 
according to their size. All costs and 
benefits are calculated as occurring in 
2014. It is important to note that these 
are very general estimates, and reflect 
our assumption for these provider 
groups at large. Due to the high 
variability in provider settings and 
systems, these estimates are not meant 
to reflect costs for specific providers. 
We welcome comments on our 
assumptions.

* Both cost and cost avoidance occur in 2014. In 2012 dollars. 
3. Cost to Nonprofit Health Plans 
As noted, there are a number of health 
maintenance organizations (HMOs) that 
are small entities by virtue of their 
nonprofit status even though few if any 
of them are small by SBA size 
standards. There are approximately one 
hundred such HMOs and 38 Blue Cross 
and Blue Shield plans that are non- 
profit organizations. We have applied 
the same methodology and assumptions 
as we applied in the RIA to arrive at 
estimates to impacts to these non-profit 
health plans. We have estimated that all 
of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans 
are large health plans, and all of the 
HMOs are small health plans. 
Table 31 illustrates the costs and 
benefits for nonprofit health plans. We 
calculated the costs per health plan 
from the low and high range estimates 
used in the RIA for large health plans 
(for Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans), 
and small health plans (for non-profit 
HMOs). We calculated the cost 
avoidance by assuming that large health 
plans would return 10 percent of the 
total health care claims—and small 
health plans would return 5 percent of 
the total health care claims—if the 
compliance date of ICD–10 continued to 
be October 1, 2013. This assumption is 
based on the fact that 25 national and 
regional health insurers account for 
nearly two-thirds of the total market, 
and that this proportion accounts can be 
applied to total claims; for example that 
smaller health insurers process one- 
third of the claims. All costs and cost 
avoidance are calculated as occurring in 
2014.

Tables 31 and 32 both illustrate that 
a 1-year delay in the compliance date of 
ICD–10 will be more beneficial to small 
and nonprofit entities than it will be 
burdensome. Nevertheless, we are 
specifically requesting comments on our 
analysis.
