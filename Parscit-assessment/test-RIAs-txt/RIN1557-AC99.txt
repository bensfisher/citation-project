AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, Department of the Treasury; 
Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System; and Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking 
with request for public comment. 
SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency (OCC), Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (Board), and Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are 
requesting comment on a proposal to 
revise their market risk capital rules to 
modify their scope to better capture 
positions for which the market risk 
capital rules are appropriate; reduce 
procyclicality in market risk capital 
requirements; enhance the rules’ 
sensitivity to risks that are not 
adequately captured under the current 
regulatory measurement methodologies; 
and increase transparency through 
enhanced disclosures. The proposal 
does not include the methodologies 
adopted by the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision for calculating the 
specific risk capital requirements for 
debt and securitization positions due to 
their reliance on credit ratings, which is 
impermissible under the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act. The proposal, therefore, 
retains the current specific risk 
treatment for these positions until the 
agencies develop alternative standards 
of creditworthiness as required by the 
Act. The proposed rules are 
substantively the same across the 
agencies. 
DATES: Comments on this notice of 
proposed rulemaking must be received 
by April 11, 2011.

I. Introduction 
A. Background 
The first international capital 
framework for banks 1 entitled 
International Convergence of Capital 
Measurement and Capital Standards 
(1988 Capital Accord) was developed by 
the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (BCBS) 2 and endorsed by 
the G–10 governors in 1988. The OCC, 
the Board, and the FDIC (collectively, 
the agencies) implemented the 1988 
Capital Accord in 1989 through the 
issuance of the general risk-based 
capital rules.3 In 1996, the BCBS 
amended the 1988 Capital Accord to 
require banks to measure and hold 
capital to cover their exposure to market 
risk associated with foreign exchange 
and commodity positions and positions 
located in the trading account (the 
Market Risk Amendment (MRA) or 
market risk framework).4 The agencies 
implemented the MRA with an effective 
date of January 1, 1997 (market risk 
capital rule).5 
In June 2004, the BCBS issued a 
document entitled International 
Convergence of Capital Measurement 
and Capital Standards: A Revised 
Framework (New Accord or Basel II), 
which was intended for use by 
individual countries as the basis for 
national consultation and 
implementation. The New Accord sets 
forth a ‘‘three-pillar’’ framework that 
includes (i) risk-based capital 
requirements for credit risk, market risk, 
and operational risk (Pillar 1); (ii) 
supervisory review of capital adequacy 
(Pillar 2); and (iii) market discipline 
through enhanced public disclosures 
(Pillar 3). 
The New Accord retained much of the 
MRA; however, after its release, the 
BCBS announced that it would develop 
improvements to the market risk 
framework, especially with respect to 
the treatment of specific risk, which 
refers to the risk of loss on a position 
due to factors other than broad-based 
movements in market prices. As a 
result, in July 2005, the BCBS and the 
International Organization of Securities 
Commissions (IOSCO) published The 
Application of Basel II to Trading 
Activities and the Treatment of Double 
Default Effects. The BCBS incorporated 
the July 2005 changes into the June 2006 
comprehensive version of the New 
Accord and follow its ‘‘three-pillar’’ 
structure. Specifically, the Pillar 1

1892 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
6 71 FR 55958, (September 25, 2006). The 2006 
proposal was issued jointly by the agencies and the 
Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). In the proposal, 
the OTS, which had not previously adopted the 
MRA, proposed adopting a market risk capital rule. 
7 The June 2010 revisions can be found, in their 
entirety, at http://bis.org/press/p100618/annex.pdf. 
8 The agencies’ advanced approaches rules are at 
12 CFR part 3, Appendix C (OCC); 12 CFR part 208, 
Appendix F and 12 CFR part 225, Appendix G 
(Board); and 12 CFR part 325, Appendix D (FDIC). 
For purposes of this preamble, the term ‘‘credit risk 
capital rules’’ refers to the general risk-based capital 
rules and the advanced approaches rules (that also 
apply to operational risk), as applicable to the bank 
using the proposed rule. 
9 Idiosyncratic risk is the risk of loss in the value 
of a position that arises from changes in risk factors 
unique to that position. Event risk is the risk of loss 
on a position that could result from sudden and 
unexpected large changes in market prices or 
specific events other than the default of the issuer. 
Default risk is the risk of loss on a position that 
could result from the failure of an obligor to make 
timely payments of principal or interest on its debt 
obligation, and the risk of loss that could result 
from bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding. 
For credit derivatives, default risk means the risk 
of loss on a position that could result from the 
default of the reference exposure(s). 
10 The primary Federal supervisor of a bank may 
also permit the use of alternative techniques to 
measure the market risk of de minimis exposures, 
if the techniques adequately measure associated 
market risk. 
changes narrow the types of positions 
that are subject to the market risk 
framework and revise modeling 
standards and procedures for 
calculating minimum regulatory capital 
requirements; the Pillar 2 changes 
require banks to conduct internal 
assessments of their capital adequacy 
with respect to market risk, taking into 
account the output of their internal 
models, valuation adjustments, and 
stress tests; and the Pillar 3 changes 
require banks to disclose certain 
quantitative and qualitative information, 
including their valuation techniques for 
covered positions, the soundness 
standard used for modeling purposes, 
and their internal capital adequacy 
assessment methodologies. 
In September 2006, the agencies 
issued a joint notice of proposed 
rulemaking (2006 proposal) in which 
they proposed amendments to their 
market risk capital rules that would 
implement the BCBS’s changes to the 
market risk framework.6 The BCBS 
began work on significant changes to the 
market risk framework in 2007 due to 
issues highlighted by the financial 
crisis. As a result, the agencies did not 
finalize the 2006 proposal. This joint 
notice of proposed rulemaking 
(proposed rule) incorporates aspects of 
the agencies’ 2006 proposal as well as 
further revisions to the New Accord 
(and associated guidance) published by 
the BCBS in July 2009. These 
publications include Revisions to the 
Basel II Market Risk Framework, 
Guidelines for Computing Capital for 
Incremental Risk in the Trading Book, 
and Enhancements to the Basel II 
Framework (collectively, the 2009 
revisions). 
The 2009 revisions to the market risk 
framework place additional prudential 
requirements on banks’ internal models 
for measuring market risk and require 
enhanced qualitative and quantitative 
disclosures, particularly with respect to 
banks’ securitization activities. The 
revisions also introduce an incremental 
risk capital requirement to capture 
default and credit quality migration risk 
for non-securitization credit products. 
With respect to securitizations, the 2009 
revisions require banks to apply the 
standardized measurement method for 
specific risk to these positions, except 
for ‘‘correlation trading’’ positions 
(described further below), for which 
banks may choose to model all material 
price risks. The 2009 revisions also add 
a stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR)-based 
capital requirement to banks’ VaR-based 
capital requirement under the existing 
framework. In June, 2010, the BCBS 
published additional revisions to the 
market risk framework that included 
establishing a floor on the risk-based 
capital requirement for modeled 
correlation trading positions.7 
These revisions to the market risk 
framework and other proposed revisions 
are discussed more fully below. Part I.B. 
of this preamble summarizes and 
provides background on the current 
market risk capital rule. Part II describes 
the proposed revisions to the market 
risk capital rule that incorporate aspects 
of the BCBS 2005 and 2009 revisions to 
the market risk framework. 
Question 1: The agencies request 
comment on all aspects of the proposed 
rule and specifically on whether and for 
what reasons certain aspects of the 
proposed rule present particular 
implementation challenges. Responses 
should be detailed as to the nature and 
impact of such challenges. What, if any, 
specific approaches (for example, 
transitional arrangements) should the 
agencies consider to address such 
challenges and why? 
B. Summary of the Current Market Risk 
Capital Rule 
The current market risk capital rule 
supplements both the agencies’ general 
risk-based capital rules and the 
advanced capital adequacy guidelines 
(advanced approaches rules) 
(collectively, the credit risk capital 
rules) 8 by requiring any bank subject to 
the market risk capital rule to adjust its 
risk-based capital ratios to reflect market 
risk in its trading activities. The rule 
applies to a bank with worldwide, 
consolidated trading activity equal to 10 
percent or more of total assets, or $1 
billion or more. The primary Federal 
supervisor of a bank may apply the 
market risk capital rule to a bank if the 
supervisor deems it necessary or 
appropriate for safe and sound banking 
practices. In addition, the supervisor 
may exempt a bank that meets the 
threshold criteria from application of 
the rule if the supervisor determines the 
bank meets such criteria as a 
consequence of accounting, operational, 
or similar considerations, and the 
supervisor deems such an exemption to 
be consistent with safe and sound 
banking practices. 
1. Covered Positions 
The current market risk capital rule 
requires a bank to maintain regulatory 
capital against the market risk of its 
covered positions. Covered positions are 
defined as all on- and off-balance sheet 
positions in the bank’s trading account 
(as defined in the instructions to the 
Consolidated Reports of Condition and 
Income (Call Report) or to the FR Y–9C 
Consolidated Financial Statements for 
Bank Holding Companies (FR Y–9C)), 
and all foreign exchange and 
commodity positions, whether or not 
they are in the trading account. Covered 
positions exclude all positions in the 
trading account that, in form or 
substance, act as liquidity facilities that 
provide liquidity support to asset- 
backed commercial paper. 
2. Capital Requirement for Market Risk 
The current market risk capital rule 
defines market risk as the risk of loss 
resulting from movements in market 
prices. Market risk consists of general 
market risk and specific risk 
components. General market risk is 
defined as changes in the market value 
of positions resulting from broad market 
movements, such as changes in the 
general level of interest rates, equity 
prices, foreign exchange rates, or 
commodity prices. Specific risk is 
defined as changes in the market value 
of a position due to factors other than 
broad market movements and includes 
event and default risk, as well as 
idiosyncratic risk.9 
A bank that is subject to the market 
risk capital rule is required to use an 
internal model to calculate a VaR-based 
measure of its exposure to market risk. 
A bank’s total risk-based capital 
requirement for covered positions 
generally consists of a VaR-based capital 
requirement plus an add-on for specific 
risk, if specific risk is not captured in 
the bank’s internal VaR model.10 The 
VaR-based capital requirement is based

1893 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
11 See section 5(c) of the agencies’ market risk 
capital rules for a description of this method. 
12 In addition, for futures contracts on broadly 
based indices that are matched by offsetting equity 
baskets, a bank may apply a 2.0 percent specific risk 
requirement to the futures and stock basket 
positions if the basket comprises at least 90 percent 
of the capitalization of the index. The 2.0 percent 
specific risk requirement applies to only one side 
of certain futures-related arbitrage strategies when 
either: (i) The long and short positions are in 
exactly the same index at different dates or in 
different markets; or (ii) the long and short 
positions are in different but similar indices at the 
same date. 
13 Foreign exchange positions outside the trading 
account and all over-the-counter derivative 
positions, regardless of whether they are in the 
trading account, must be included in a bank’s risk- 
weighted assets as determined under the general 
risk-based capital rules. 
on an estimate of the amount that the 
value of one or more positions could 
decline over a stated time horizon and 
at a stated confidence level. A bank may 
determine its capital requirement for 
specific risk using a standardized 
method or, with supervisory approval, 
may use internal models to measure its 
minimum capital requirement for 
specific risk. 
3. Internal Models-Based Capital 
Requirement 
In calculating the capital requirement 
for market risk, a bank is required to use 
an internal model that meets specified 
qualitative and quantitative criteria. The 
qualitative requirements reflect basic 
components of sound market risk 
management. For example, the current 
market risk capital rule requires an 
independent risk control unit that 
reports directly to senior management 
and an internal risk measurement model 
that is integrated into the daily 
management process. The quantitative 
criteria include the use of a VaR-based 
measure based on a 99.0 percent, one- 
tailed confidence level. The VaR-based 
measure must be based on a price shock 
equivalent to a 10-business-day 
movement in rates or prices. Price 
changes estimated using shorter time 
periods must be adjusted to the 10- 
business-day standard. The minimum 
effective historical observation period 
for deriving the rate or price changes is 
one year and data sets must be updated 
at least every three months or more 
frequently if market conditions warrant. 
In all cases, under the current rule, a 
bank must have the capability to update 
its data sets more frequently than every 
three months in anticipation of market 
conditions that would require such 
updating. 
A bank need not use a single model 
to calculate its VaR-based measure. A 
bank’s internal model may use any 
generally accepted approach, such as 
variance-covariance models, historical 
simulations, or Monte Carlo 
simulations. However, the level of 
sophistication of the bank’s internal 
model must be commensurate with the 
nature and size of the positions it 
covers. The internal model must use 
risk factors sufficient to measure the 
market risk inherent in all covered 
positions. The risk factors must address 
interest rate risk, equity price risk, 
foreign exchange rate risk, and 
commodity price risk. 
The current market risk capital rule 
imposes backtesting requirements that 
must be calculated quarterly. A bank 
must compare its daily VaR-based 
measure for each of the preceding 250 
business days to its actual daily trading 
profit or loss, which typically includes 
realized and unrealized gains and losses 
on portfolio positions as well as fee 
income and commissions associated 
with trading activities. If the quarterly 
backtesting shows that the bank’s daily 
net trading loss exceeded its 
corresponding daily VaR-based 
measure, a backtesting exception has 
occurred. If a bank experiences more 
than four backtesting exceptions over 
the preceding 250 business days, it is 
generally required to apply a 
multiplication factor in excess of 3 
when it calculates its risk-based capital 
ratio (see section I.B.5 of this preamble). 
A bank subject to the market risk 
capital rule is also required to conduct 
stress tests to assess the impact of 
adverse market events on its positions. 
The market risk capital rule does not 
prescribe specific stress-testing 
methodologies. 
4. Specific Risk 
Under the current market risk capital 
rule, a bank may use an internal model 
to measure its exposure to specific risk 
if it has demonstrated to its primary 
Federal supervisor that the model 
measures the specific risk, including 
event and default risk, as well as 
idiosyncratic risk, of its debt and equity 
positions. A bank that incorporates 
specific risk in its internal model but 
fails to demonstrate that the model 
adequately measures all aspects of 
specific risk is subject to a specific risk 
add-on. In this case, if the bank can 
validly separate its VaR-based measure 
into a specific risk portion and a general 
market risk portion, the add-on is equal 
to the previous day’s specific risk 
portion. If the bank cannot separate the 
VaR-based measure into a specific risk 
portion and a general market risk 
portion, the add-on is equal to the sum 
of the previous day’s VaR-based 
measures for subportfolios of debt and 
equity positions that contain specific 
risk. 
If the bank does not model specific 
risk, it must calculate its specific risk 
capital requirement, or ‘‘add-on,’’ using 
a standardized method.11 Under this 
method, the specific risk add-on for debt 
positions is calculated by multiplying 
the absolute value of the current market 
value of each net long and net short 
position in a debt instrument by the 
appropriate specific risk-weighting 
factor in the rule. These specific risk- 
weighting factors range from zero to 8.0 
percent and are based on the identity of 
the obligor and, in the case of some 
positions, the credit rating and 
remaining contractual maturity of the 
position. Derivative instruments are 
risk-weighted according to the market 
value of the effective notional amount of 
the underlying position. A bank may net 
long and short debt positions (including 
derivatives) in identical debt issues or 
indices. A bank may also offset a 
‘‘matched’’ position in a derivative and 
its corresponding underlying 
instrument. 
Under the standardized method, the 
specific risk add-on for equity positions 
is the sum of the bank’s net long and 
short positions in an equity, multiplied 
by a specific risk-weighting factor. A 
bank may net long and short positions 
(including derivatives) in identical 
equity issues or equity indices in the 
same market. The specific risk add-on is 
8.0 percent of the net equity position, 
unless the bank’s portfolio is both liquid 
and well-diversified, in which case the 
specific risk add-on is 4.0 percent. For 
positions that are index contracts 
comprising a well-diversified portfolio 
of equities, the specific risk add-on is 
2.0 percent of the net long or net short 
position in the index.12 
5. Calculation of the Risk-Based Capital 
Ratio 
A bank subject to the current market 
risk capital rule must calculate its 
adjusted risk-based capital ratios as 
follows. First, the bank must calculate 
its adjusted risk-weighted assets, which 
equals its risk-weighted assets 
calculated under the general risk-based 
capital rule excluding the risk-weighted 
amounts of covered positions (except 
foreign exchange positions outside the 
trading account and over-the-counter 
derivative instruments) 13 and cash- 
secured securities borrowing receivables 
that meet the criteria of the market risk 
capital rule. 
The bank then must calculate its 
measure for market risk, which equals 
the sum of the VaR-based capital 
requirement for market risk, the specific 
risk add-on (if any), and the capital

14 Tier 1 and tier 2 capital are defined in the 
general risk-based capital rules. Tier 3 capital is 
subordinated debt that is unsecured, is fully paid 
up, has an original maturity of at least two years, 
is not redeemable before maturity without prior 
approval by the primary Federal supervisor, 
includes a lock-in clause precluding payment of 
either interest or principal (even at maturity) if the 
payment would cause the issuing bank’s risk-based 
capital ratio to fall or remain below the minimum 
required under the credit risk capital rules, and 
does not contain and is not covered by any 
covenants, terms, or restrictions that are 
inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. 
requirement for de minimis exposures 
(if any). The VaR-based capital 
requirement equals the greater of (i) the 
previous day’s VaR-based measure; or 
(ii) the average of the daily VaR-based 
measures for each of the preceding 60 
business days multiplied by three, or 
such higher multiplier as may be 
required under the backtesting 
requirements of the market risk capital 
rule. The measure for market risk is 
multiplied by 12.5 to calculate market- 
risk-equivalent assets. The market-risk- 
equivalent assets are added to adjusted 
risk-weighted assets to compute the 
denominator of the bank’s risk-based 
capital ratio. 
To calculate the numerator, the bank 
must allocate tier 1 and tier 2 capital 
equal to 8.0 percent of adjusted risk- 
weighted assets, and further allocate 
excess tier 1, excess tier 2, and tier 3 14 
capital equal to the measure for market 
risk. The sum of tier 2 and tier 3 capital 
allocated for market risk may not exceed 
250 percent of tier 1 capital. As a result, 
tier 1 capital must equal at least 28.6 
percent of the measure for market risk. 
The sum of tier 2 (both allocated and 
excess) and allocated tier 3 capital may 
not exceed 100 percent of tier 1 capital 
(both allocated and excess). Term 
subordinated debt and intermediate- 
term preferred stock and related surplus 
included in tier 2 capital (both allocated 
and excess) may not exceed 50 percent 
of tier 1 capital (both allocated and 
excess). The sum of tier 1 and tier 2 
capital (both allocated and excess) and 
allocated tier 3 capital is the numerator 
of the bank’s total risk-based capital 
ratio. 
II. Proposed Revisions to the Market 
Risk Capital Rule 
A. Objectives of the Proposed Revisions 
The key objectives of the proposed 
revisions to the current market risk 
capital rule are to enhance the rule’s 
sensitivity to risks that are not 
adequately captured by the current rule; 
to enhance modeling requirements in a 
manner that is consistent with advances 
in risk management since the initial 
implementation of the rule; to modify 
the definition of covered position to 
better capture positions for which 
treatment under the rule is appropriate; 
to address shortcomings in the modeling 
of certain risks; to address certain 
procyclicality concerns; and to increase 
transparency through enhanced 
disclosures. The objective of enhancing 
the risk sensitivity of the rule is 
particularly important because of banks’ 
increased exposure to traded credit 
products, such as credit default swaps 
(CDSs) and asset-backed securities, in 
other structured products, and in less 
liquid products. The risks of these 
products are generally not fully 
captured in current VaR models, which 
rely on a 10-business-day, one-tail, 99.0 
percent confidence level soundness 
standard. 
For example, the growth in traded 
credit products has increased default 
and credit migration risks that should be 
captured in a regulatory capital 
requirement for specific risk but have 
proved difficult to capture adequately 
within current specific risk models. The 
agencies did not contemplate risks 
associated with less liquid credit 
products when the market risk capital 
rule was first adopted. Therefore, the 
agencies propose to implement an 
incremental risk capital requirement 
that would apply to a bank that models 
specific risk for one or more portfolios 
of debt or, if applicable, equity 
positions, and to incorporate explicit 
measures of liquidity. 
In addition, to address the agencies’ 
concerns about the appropriate 
treatment of covered positions that have 
limited price transparency, the agencies 
propose to require banks to have a well- 
defined valuation process for all 
covered positions. The specific 
proposals are discussed below. 
B. Description of the Proposed Revisions 
to the Market Risk Capital Rule 
1. Scope 
The proposed market risk capital rule 
does not change the set of banks to 
which the rule applies. That is, the 
proposed rule continues to apply to any 
bank with aggregate trading assets and 
trading liabilities equal to 10 percent or 
more of total assets, or $1 billion or 
more. The proposed rule applies to a 
bank that meets the market risk capital 
rule applicability threshold regardless of 
whether the bank uses the general risk- 
based capital rules or the advanced 
approaches rules. 
The primary Federal supervisor of a 
bank that does not meet the threshold 
criteria may apply the market risk 
capital rule to the bank if the supervisor 
deems it necessary or appropriate given 
the level of market risk of the bank or 
to ensure safe and sound banking 
practices. The primary Federal 
supervisor may also exclude a bank that 
meets the threshold criteria from 
application of the rule if the supervisor 
determines that the exclusion is 
appropriate based on the level of market 
risk of the bank and is consistent with 
safe and sound banking practices. 
Question 2: The agencies seek 
comment on the appropriateness of the 
proposed applicability thresholds. 
What, if any, alternative thresholds 
should the agencies consider and why? 
2. Reservation of Authority 
The proposed rule contains a 
reservation of authority that affirms the 
authority of a bank’s primary Federal 
supervisor to require the bank to hold 
an overall amount of capital greater than 
would otherwise be required under the 
rule if the supervisor determines that 
the bank’s risk-based capital 
requirements under the rule are not 
commensurate with the market risk of 
the bank’s covered positions. In 
addition, the agencies anticipate that 
there may be instances when the 
proposed rule would generate a risk- 
based capital requirement for a specific 
covered position or portfolio of covered 
positions that is not commensurate with 
the risks of the covered position or 
portfolio. In these cases, a bank’s 
primary Federal supervisor may require 
the bank to assign a different risk-based 
capital requirement to the covered 
position or portfolio of covered 
positions that better reflects the risk of 
the position or portfolio. The proposed 
rule also provides authority for a bank’s 
primary Federal supervisor to require 
the bank to calculate capital 
requirements for specific positions or 
portfolios under the market risk capital 
rule or under either the general risk- 
based capital rules or advanced 
approaches rules, as appropriate, to 
more appropriately reflect the risks of 
the positions. 
3. Modification of the Definition of 
Covered Position 
The proposed rule modifies the 
definition of a covered position to 
include trading assets and trading 
liabilities (as reported on schedule RC– 
D of the Call Report or Schedule HC–D 
of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for Bank Holding 
Companies) that are trading positions. 
Under the proposal, a trading position is 
defined as a position that is held by the 
bank for the purpose of short-term resale 
or with the intent of benefiting from 
actual or expected short-term price 
movements, or to lock in arbitrage 
profits. Thus, the characterization of an

1895 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
15 See 12 CFR part 3, section 3 (OCC); 12 CFR part 
208, Appendix A, section II.B and 12 CFR part 225, 
Appendix A, section II.B (Board); and 12 CFR part 
325, Appendix A, section II.B.3 (FDIC). The 
treatment of guarantees is described in sections 33 
and 34 of the advanced approaches rules. 
asset or liability as ‘‘trading’’ for 
purposes of U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP) will not 
necessarily determine whether the asset 
or liability is a ‘‘trading position’’ for 
purposes of the proposed rule. 
Commenters on the 2006 proposal 
expressed concerns that the proposed 
covered position definition would 
create inconsistencies between the 
regulatory capital treatment of certain 
trading assets and trading liabilities and 
the treatment of those positions under 
GAAP. The agencies, however, continue 
to believe that relying on the accounting 
definition of trading assets and trading 
liabilities, without modification, would 
not be appropriate because it includes 
positions that are not held with the 
intent or ability to trade. 
The proposed covered position 
definition includes trading assets and 
trading liabilities that hedge covered 
positions. In addition, the trading asset 
or trading liability must be free of any 
restrictive covenants on its tradability or 
the bank must be able to hedge its 
material risk elements in a two-way 
market. A trading asset or trading 
liability that hedges a trading position is 
a covered position only if the hedge is 
within the scope of the bank’s hedging 
strategy (discussed below). The agencies 
encourage the sound risk management 
of trading positions. Therefore, the 
agencies include in the definition of a 
covered position any hedges that offset 
the risk of trading positions. The 
agencies are concerned, however, that a 
bank could craft its hedging strategies in 
order to bring non-trading positions that 
are more appropriately treated under the 
credit risk capital rules into the bank’s 
covered positions. The agencies will 
review a bank’s hedging strategies to 
ensure that they are not being 
manipulated in this manner. For 
example, mortgage-backed securities 
that are not held with the intent to 
trade, but that are hedged with interest 
rate swaps to mitigate interest rate risk, 
would be subject to the credit risk 
capital rules. 
Consistent with the current definition 
of covered position, under the proposed 
rule, a covered position also includes 
any foreign exchange or commodity 
position, whether or not it is a trading 
asset or trading liability. With prior 
supervisory approval, a bank may 
exclude from its covered positions any 
structural position in a foreign currency, 
which is defined as a position that is not 
a trading position and that is (i) a 
subordinated debt, equity, or minority 
interest in a consolidated subsidiary 
that is denominated in a foreign 
currency; (ii) capital assigned to foreign 
branches that is denominated in a 
foreign currency; (iii) a position related 
to an unconsolidated subsidiary or 
another item that is denominated in a 
foreign currency and that is deducted 
from the bank’s tier 1 and tier 2 capital; 
or (iv) a position designed to hedge a 
bank’s capital ratios or earnings against 
the effect of adverse exchange rate 
movements on (i), (ii), or (iii). 
Also consistent with the current rule, 
the proposed definition of a covered 
position explicitly excludes any 
position that, in form or substance, acts 
as a liquidity facility that provides 
support to asset-backed commercial 
paper. In addition, the definition of 
covered position excludes all intangible 
assets, including servicing assets. 
Intangible assets are excluded because 
their risks are explicitly addressed in 
the credit risk capital rules, often 
through a deduction from capital. 
The proposed covered position 
definition excludes any equity position 
that is not publicly traded, other than a 
derivative that references a publicly 
traded equity; any direct real estate 
holding; and any position that a bank 
holds with the intent to securitize. 
Equity positions that are not publicly 
traded would include private equity 
investments, most hedge fund 
investments, and other such closely- 
held and non-liquid investments that 
are not easily marketable. Direct real 
estate holdings include real estate for 
which the bank holds title, such as 
‘‘other real estate owned’’ held from 
foreclosure activities, and bank 
premises used by a bank as part of its 
ongoing business activities. With such 
real estate holdings, marketability and 
liquidity are uncertain or even 
impractical as the assets are an integral 
part of the bank’s ongoing business. 
Indirect investments in real estate, such 
as through real estate investment trusts 
or special purpose vehicles, must meet 
the definition of a trading position in 
order to be a covered position. Positions 
that a bank holds with the intent to 
securitize include a ‘‘pipeline’’ or 
‘‘warehouse’’ of loans being held for 
securitization; the agencies do not view 
the intent to securitize these positions 
as synonymous with the intent to trade 
them. Consistent with the 2009 
revisions, the agencies believe all of 
these excluded positions have 
significant constraints in terms of a 
bank’s ability to liquidate them readily 
and value them reliably on a daily basis. 
The proposed covered position 
definition excludes a credit derivative 
that the bank recognizes as a guarantee 
for purposes of calculating the amount 
of risk-weighted assets under the credit 
risk capital rules 15 if it is used to hedge 
a position that is not a covered position 
(for example, a credit derivative hedge 
of a loan that is not a covered position). 
This requires the bank to include the 
credit derivative in its risk-weighted 
assets for credit risk and exclude it from 
its VaR-based measure for market risk. 
This proposed treatment of a credit 
derivative hedge avoids the mismatch 
that arises when the hedged position 
(for example, a loan) is not a covered 
position and the credit derivative hedge 
is a covered position. This mismatch 
has the potential to overstate the VaR- 
based measure of market risk if only one 
side of the transaction were reflected in 
that measure. 
Question 3: The agencies request 
comment on all aspects of the proposed 
definition of covered position. 
Under the proposed rule, in addition 
to commodities and foreign exchange 
positions, covered positions include 
debt positions, equity positions and 
securitization positions. The proposal 
defines a debt position as a covered 
position that is not a securitization 
position or a correlation trading position 
and that has a value that reacts 
primarily to changes in interest rates or 
credit spreads. Examples of debt 
positions include corporate and 
government bonds, certain 
nonconvertible preferred stock, certain 
convertible bonds, and derivatives 
(including written and purchased 
options) for which the underlying 
instrument is a debt position. 
The proposal defines an equity 
position as a covered position that is not 
a securitization position or a correlation 
trading position and that has a value 
that reacts primarily to changes in 
equity prices. Examples of equity 
positions include voting or nonvoting 
common stock, certain convertible 
bonds, commitments to buy or sell 
equity instruments, equity indices, and 
a derivative for which the underlying 
instrument is an equity position. 
Under the proposal, a securitization is 
a transaction in which: (i) All or a 
portion of the credit risk of one or more 
underlying exposures is transferred to 
one or more third parties; (ii) the credit 
risk associated with the underlying 
exposures has been separated into at 
least two tranches that reflect different 
levels of seniority; (iii) performance of 
the securitization exposures depends 
upon the performance of the underlying 
exposures; (iv) all or substantially all of

1896 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
16 In a synthetic securitization, a company uses 
credit derivatives or guarantees to transfer a portion 
of the credit risk of one or more underlying 
exposures to third-party protection providers. The 
credit derivative or guarantee may be collateralized 
or uncollateralized. 
the underlying exposures are financial 
exposures (such as loans, commitments, 
credit derivatives, guarantees, 
receivables, asset-backed securities, 
mortgage-backed securities, other debt 
securities, or equity securities); (v) for 
non-synthetic securitizations, the 
underlying exposures are not owned by 
an operating company; 16 (vi) the 
underlying exposures are not owned by 
a small business investment company 
described in section 302 of the Small 
Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 
U.S.C. 682); and (vii) the underlying 
exposures are not owned by a firm an 
investment in which qualifies as a 
community development investment 
under 12 U.S.C. 24 (Eleventh). Further, 
a bank’s primary Federal supervisor 
may determine that a transaction in 
which the underlying exposures are 
owned by an investment firm that 
exercises substantially unfettered 
control over the size and composition of 
its assets, liabilities, and off-balance 
sheet exposures is not a securitization 
based on the transaction’s leverage, risk 
profile, or economic substance. 
Generally, the agencies would consider 
investment firms that can easily change 
the size and composition of their capital 
structure, as well as the size and 
composition of their assets and off- 
balance sheet exposures as eligible for 
exclusion from the securitization 
definition under this provision. Based 
on a particular transaction’s leverage, 
risk profile, or economic substance, a 
bank’s primary Federal supervisor may 
deem an exposure to a transaction to be 
a securitization exposure, even if the 
exposure does not meet the criteria in 
provisions (v), (vi), or (vii) above. A 
securitization position is a covered 
position that is (i) an on-balance sheet 
or off-balance sheet credit exposure 
(including credit-enhancing 
representations and warranties) that 
arises from a securitization (including a 
resecuritization); or (ii) an exposure that 
directly or indirectly references a 
securitization exposure described in 
(i) above. 
A securitization position includes 
nth-to-default credit derivatives and 
resecuritization positions. The proposal 
defines an nth-to-default credit 
derivative as a credit derivative that 
provides credit protection only for the 
nth-defaulting reference exposure in a 
group of reference exposures. In 
addition, under the proposal, a 
resecuritization is a securitization in 
which one or more of the underlying 
exposures is a securitization exposure. 
A resecuritization position is (i) an on- 
or off-balance sheet exposure to a 
resecuritization; or (ii) an exposure that 
directly or indirectly references a 
resecuritization exposure described 
in (i). 
The proposal defines a correlation 
trading position as (i) a securitization 
position for which all or substantially 
all of the value of the underlying 
exposures is based on the credit quality 
of a single company for which a two- 
way market exists, or on commonly 
traded indices based on such exposures 
for which a two-way market exists on 
the indices; or (ii) a position that is not 
a securitization position and that hedges 
a position described in clause (i) above. 
Under the proposed definition, a 
correlation trading position does not 
include a resecuritization position, a 
derivative of a securitization position 
that does not provide a pro rata share in 
the proceeds of a securitization tranche, 
or a securitization position for which 
the underlying assets or reference 
exposures are retail exposures, 
residential mortgage exposures, or 
commercial mortgage exposures. 
Correlation trading positions are 
typically not rated by external credit 
rating agencies and may include CDO 
index tranches, bespoke CDO tranches, 
and nth-to-default credit derivatives. 
Standardized CDS indices and single- 
name CDSs are examples of instruments 
used to hedge these positions. While 
banks typically hedge correlation 
trading positions, hedging frequently 
does not reduce a bank’s net exposure 
to a position because the hedges often 
do not perfectly match the position. 
4. Requirements for the Identification of 
Trading Positions and Management of 
Covered Positions 
Section 3 of the proposal introduces 
new requirements for the identification 
of trading positions and the 
management of covered positions. The 
agencies believe that these new 
requirements are warranted based on 
the inclusion of more credit risk-related, 
less liquid, and less actively traded 
products in banks’ covered positions. 
The risks of these positions may not be 
fully reflected in the requirements of the 
market risk capital rule and may be 
more appropriately captured under 
credit risk capital rules. 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
have clearly defined policies and 
procedures for determining which of its 
trading assets and trading liabilities are 
trading positions as well as which of its 
trading positions are correlation trading 
positions. In determining the scope of 
trading positions, the bank must 
consider (i) the extent to which a 
position (or a hedge of its material risks) 
can be marked-to-market daily by 
reference to a two-way market; and 
(ii) possible impairments to the liquidity 
of a position or its hedge. 
In addition, the bank must have 
clearly defined trading and hedging 
strategies. The bank’s trading and 
hedging strategies for its trading 
positions must be approved by senior 
management. The trading strategy must 
articulate the expected holding period 
of, and the market risk associated with, 
each portfolio of trading positions. The 
hedging strategy must articulate for each 
portfolio the level of market risk the 
bank is willing to accept and must detail 
the instruments, techniques, and 
strategies the bank will use to hedge the 
risk of the portfolio. The hedging 
strategy should be applied at the level 
at which trading positions are risk 
managed at the bank (for example, 
trading desk, portfolio levels). 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
have clearly defined policies and 
procedures for actively managing all 
covered positions. In the context of non- 
traded commodities and foreign 
exchange positions, active management 
includes managing the risks of those 
positions within the bank’s risk limits. 
For all covered positions, these policies 
and procedures, at a minimum, must 
require (i) marking positions to market 
or model on a daily basis; (ii) assessing 
on a daily basis the bank’s ability to 
hedge position and portfolio risks and 
the extent of market liquidity; (iii) 
establishment and daily monitoring of 
limits on positions by a risk control unit 
independent of the trading business 
unit; (iv) daily monitoring by senior 
management of the information 
described in (i) through (iii) above; 
(v) at least annual reassessment by 
senior management of established limits 
on positions; and (vi) at least annual 
assessments by qualified personnel of 
the quality of market inputs to the 
valuation process, the soundness of key 
assumptions, the reliability of parameter 
estimation in pricing models, and the 
stability and accuracy of model 
calibration under alternative market 
scenarios. 
The proposed rule introduces new 
requirements for the prudent valuation 
of covered positions that include

costs, future administrative costs, 
liquidity, and model risk. These new 
valuation requirements reflect the 
agencies’ concerns about deficiencies in 
banks’ valuation of less liquid trading 
positions, especially in light of the 
historical focus of the market risk 
capital rule on a 10-business-day time 
horizon and a one-tail, 99.0 percent 
confidence level, which has proved to 
be inadequate at times to reflect the full 
extent of the risks of less liquid 
positions. 
5. General Requirements for Internal 
Models 
Model Approval and Ongoing Use 
Requirements. Under the proposed rule, 
a bank must receive the prior written 
approval of its primary Federal 
supervisor before using any internal 
model to calculate its market risk capital 
requirement. The 2006 proposal 
included a requirement that a bank 
receive prior written approval from its 
primary Federal supervisor before 
extending the use of an approved model 
to an additional business line or product 
type. Some commenters raised concerns 
that this requirement might unduly 
impede a new product launch pending 
regulatory approval. The agencies have 
not included this requirement in the 
proposed rule. Instead, the proposal 
requires that a bank promptly notify its 
primary Federal supervisor when the 
bank plans to extend the use of a model 
that the primary Federal supervisor has 
approved to an additional business line 
or product type. 
The proposed rule also requires a 
bank to notify its primary Federal 
supervisor promptly if it makes any 
change to its internal models that would 
result in a material change in the bank’s 
amount of risk-weighted assets for a 
portfolio of covered positions or when 
the bank makes any material change to 
its modeling assumptions. The bank’s 
primary Federal supervisor may rescind 
its approval, in whole or in part, of the 
use of any internal model, and 
determine an appropriate regulatory 
capital requirement for the covered 
positions to which the model would 
apply, if it determines that the model no 
longer complies with the market risk 
capital rule or fails to reflect accurately 
the risks of the bank’s covered positions. 
For example, if adverse market events or 
other developments reveal that a 
material assumption in a bank’s 
approved model is flawed, the bank’s 
primary Federal supervisor may require 
the bank to revise its model 
assumptions and resubmit the model 
specifications for review by the 
supervisor. 
Financial markets evolve rapidly, and 
internal models that were state-of-the- 
art at the time they were approved for 
use in risk-based capital calculations 
can become less relevant as the risks of 
covered positions evolve and as the 
industry develops more sophisticated 
modeling techniques that better capture 
material risks. The proposed rule 
therefore requires a bank to review its 
internal models periodically, but no less 
frequently than annually, in light of 
developments in financial markets and 
modeling technologies, and to enhance 
those models as appropriate to ensure 
that they continue to meet the agencies’ 
standards for model approval and 
employ risk measurement 
methodologies that are most appropriate 
for the bank’s covered positions. It is 
essential that a bank continually 
improve its models to ensure that its 
market risk capital requirement reflects 
the risk of the bank’s covered positions. 
A bank’s primary Federal supervisor 
will closely scrutinize the bank’s model 
review practices as a matter of safety 
and soundness. 
To support the model review and 
enhancement requirement discussed 
above, the agencies are considering 
imposing a capital supplement in 
circumstances in which a bank’s 
internal model continues to meet the 
qualification requirements of the rule, 
but develops specific shortcomings in 
risk identification, risk aggregation and 
representation, or validation. The 
regulatory capital supplement would 
reflect the materiality of these 
shortcomings associated with the bank’s 
current model and could result in a risk- 
weighted assets surcharge that would 
apply until such time that the bank 
enhances its model to the satisfaction of 
its primary Federal supervisor. For 
example, the capital supplement could 
take the form of a model risk multiplier 
similar to the backtesting multiplier for 
VaR-type models in section 4 of the 
proposed rule. Depending on the 
materiality of the shortcomings, the 
supervisor could increase the multiplier 
on any model above three, generally 
subject to the restriction that the 
resulting capital requirement not exceed 
the capital requirement that would 
apply under the proposed rule’s 
standardized measurement method for 
specific risk. 
Question 4: Under what 
circumstances should the agencies 
require a model-specific capital 
supplement? What criteria could the 
agencies use to apply capital 
supplements consistently across banks? 
Aside from a capital supplement or 
withdrawal of model approval, how else 
could the agencies address concerns 
about outdated models? 
Risks Reflected in Models. Under the 
proposed rule, a bank must incorporate 
its internal models into its risk 
management process and integrate the 
internal models used for calculating its 
VaR-based measure into its daily risk 
management process. The level of 
sophistication of a bank’s models must 
be commensurate with the complexity 
and amount of its covered positions. To 
measure market risk, a bank’s internal 
models may use any generally accepted 
modeling approach, including but not 
limited to variance-covariance models, 
historical simulations, or Monte Carlo 
simulations. A bank’s internal models 
must properly measure all material risks 
in the covered positions to which they 
are applied. The proposed rule requires 
that risks arising from less liquid 
positions and positions with limited 
price transparency be modeled 
conservatively under realistic market 
scenarios. The proposed rule also 
requires a bank to have a rigorous 
process for reestimating, reevaluating 
and updating its models to ensure 
continued applicability and relevance. 
Control, Oversight, and Validation 
Mechanisms. The proposed rule 
maintains the current requirement that 
a bank have a risk control unit that 
reports directly to senior management 
and is independent of its business 
trading units. In addition, the proposed 
rule provides specific model validation 
standards that are similar to those in the 
advanced approaches rules. 
Specifically, the proposal requires a 
bank to validate its internal models 
initially and on an ongoing basis. The 
validation process must be independent 
of the internal models’ development, 
implementation, and operation, or the 
validation process must be subjected to 
an independent review of its adequacy 
and effectiveness. The review personnel 
do not necessarily have to be external to 
the bank in order to achieve the 
required independence. A bank should 
ensure that individuals who perform the 
review are not biased in their 
assessment due to their involvement in 
the development, implementation, or 
operation of the models. 
Under the proposed rule, validation 
must include an evaluation of the 
conceptual soundness of the internal 
models. This evaluation should include 
evaluation of empirical evidence and 
documentation supporting the 
methodologies used; important model 
assumptions and their limitations; 
adequacy and robustness of empirical 
data used in parameter estimation and 
model calibration; and evidence of a 
model’s strengths and weaknesses.

Validation also must include an ongoing 
monitoring process that includes a 
review and verification of processes and 
the comparison of the bank’s model 
outputs with relevant internal and 
external data sources or estimation 
techniques. The results of this 
comparison provide a valuable 
diagnostic tool for identifying potential 
weaknesses in a bank’s models. As part 
of this comparison, the bank should 
investigate the source of any differences 
between the model estimates and the 
relevant internal or external data or 
estimation techniques and whether the 
extent of the differences is appropriate. 
Validation of internal models must 
include an outcomes analysis process 
that includes backtesting. Consistent 
with the 2009 revisions, the proposed 
rule requires a bank’s validation process 
for internal models used to calculate its 
VaR-based measure to include an 
outcomes analysis process that includes 
a comparison of the changes in the 
bank’s portfolio value that would have 
occurred were end-of-day positions to 
remain unchanged (therefore, excluding 
fees, commissions, reserves, net interest 
income, and intraday trading) with VaR- 
based measures during a sample period 
not used in model development. 
The proposed rule expands upon the 
current market risk rule’s stress-testing 
requirement. Specifically, the proposal 
requires a bank to stress test the market 
risk of its covered positions at a 
frequency appropriate to each portfolio, 
and in no case less frequently than 
quarterly. The stress tests must take into 
account concentration risk, illiquidity 
under stressed market conditions, and 
other risks arising from the bank’s 
trading activities that may not be 
captured adequately in the bank’s 
internal models. For example, it may be 
appropriate for a bank to include in its 
stress testing the gapping of prices, one- 
way markets, nonlinear or deep out-of- 
the-money products, jumps-to-default, 
and significant changes in correlation. 
Relevant types of concentration risk 
include concentration by name, 
industry, sector, country, and market. 
Market concentration occurs when a 
bank holds a position that represents a 
concentrated share of the market for a 
security, and thus requires a longer than 
usual liquidity horizon to liquidate the 
position without impacting the market. 
A bank’s primary Federal supervisor 
would evaluate the robustness and 
appropriateness of a bank’s stress tests 
through the supervisory review process. 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
have an internal audit function 
independent of business-line 
management that at least annually 
assesses the effectiveness of the controls 
supporting the bank’s market risk 
measurement systems, including the 
activities of the business trading units 
and independent risk control unit, 
compliance with policies and 
procedures, and the calculation of the 
bank’s measure for market risk. The 
internal audit function should review 
the bank’s validation processes, 
including validation procedures, 
responsibilities, results, timeliness, and 
responsiveness to findings. Further, the 
internal audit function should evaluate 
the depth, scope, and quality of the risk 
management system review process and 
conduct appropriate testing to ensure 
that the conclusions of these reviews are 
well-founded. At least annually, the 
internal audit function must report its 
findings to the bank’s board of directors 
(or a committee thereof). 
Internal Assessment of Capital 
Adequacy. The proposed rule requires 
that a bank have a rigorous process for 
assessing its overall capital adequacy in 
relation to its market risk. The 
assessment must take into account 
market concentration and liquidity risks 
under stressed market conditions, as 
well as other risks that may not be 
captured fully in the VaR-based 
measure. 
Documentation. Under the proposal, a 
bank must document adequately all 
material aspects of its internal models, 
the management and valuation of 
covered positions, its control, oversight, 
validation and review processes and 
results, and its internal assessment of 
capital adequacy. This documentation 
would facilitate the supervisory review 
process as well as the bank’s internal 
audit or other review procedures. 
6. Capital Requirement for Market Risk 
As under the current rule, the 
proposed rule requires a bank to 
calculate its risk-based capital ratio 
denominator as the sum of its adjusted 
risk-weighted assets and market risk 
equivalent assets. To calculate market 
risk equivalent assets, a bank must 
multiply its measure for market risk by 
12.5. Under the proposed rule, a bank’s 
measure for market risk equals the sum 
of its VaR-based capital requirement, its 
stressed VaR-based capital requirement, 
any specific risk add-ons, any 
incremental risk capital requirement, 
any comprehensive risk capital 
requirement, and any capital 
requirement for de minimis exposures, 
each calculated according to the 
requirements of the proposed rule as 
discussed further below. No 
adjustments are permitted to address 
potential double counting among any of 
these components of a bank’s measure 
for market risk. 
Also, consistent with the current rule, 
under the proposed rule a bank’s VaR- 
based capital requirement equals the 
greater of (i) the previous day’s VaR- 
based measure, or (ii) the average of the 
daily VaR-based measures for each of 
the preceding 60 business days 
multiplied by three, or such higher 
multiplication factor required based on 
backtesting results determined 
according to section 4 of the proposed 
rule and discussed further below. 
Similarly, under the proposed rule, a 
bank’s stressed VaR-based capital 
requirement equals the greater of (i) the 
most recent stressed VaR-based 
measure; or (ii) the average of the 
weekly VaR-based measures for each of 
the preceding 12 weeks multiplied by 
three, or such higher multiplication 
factor as required based on backtesting 
results determined according to section 
4 of the proposed rule. The 
multiplication factor applicable to the 
stressed-VaR based measure for 
purposes of this calculation is based on 
the backtesting results for its VaR-based 
measure; there is no separate 
backtesting requirement for the stressed 
VaR-based measure for purposes of 
calculating a bank’s measure for market 
risk. 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
include in its measure for market risk 
any specific risk add-on as required 
under section 7(c) of the proposed rule, 
determined using the standardized 
measurement method described in 
section 10 of the proposed rule. The 
proposed rule also requires a bank to 
include in its measure for market risk 
any capital requirement for de minimis 
exposures. Specifically, a bank must 
add to its measure for market risk the 
absolute value of the market value of 
those de minimis exposures that are not 
captured in the bank’s VaR-based 
measure unless the bank has obtained 
prior written approval from its primary 
Federal supervisor to calculate a capital 
requirement for the de minimis 
exposures using alternative techniques 
that appropriately measure the market 
risk associated with those exposures. 
With regard to a bank’s total risk-based 
capital numerator, the proposed rule 
eliminates tier 3 capital and the 
associated allocation methodologies. 
Determination of the Multiplication 
Factor. The proposed rule modifies the 
current rule’s regulatory backtesting 
framework for determining the 
multiplication factor based on the 
number of backtesting exceptions. 
Under the current market risk capital 
rule, a bank must compare its daily VaR- 
based measure to its actual daily trading 
profit or loss, which typically includes 
realized and unrealized gains and losses

on portfolio positions as well as fee 
income and commissions associated 
with trading activities. Under the 
proposed rule, each quarter, a bank 
must compare each of its most recent 
250 business days’ trading losses 
(excluding fees, commissions, reserves, 
intra-day trading, and net interest 
income) with the corresponding daily 
VaR-based measure calibrated to a one- 
day holding period and at a one-tail, 
99.0 percent confidence level. The 
excluded components of trading profit 
and loss are not modeled as part of the 
VaR-based measure. Therefore, 
excluding them from the regulatory 
backtesting framework will improve the 
accuracy of the backtesting and provide 
a better assessment of the bank’s 
internal model. Some commenters on 
the 2006 proposal raised concerns with 
this requirement; however, the agencies 
continue to believe that banks’ trading 
and reporting systems are sufficiently 
sophisticated to allow this type of 
backtesting. 
Question 5: The agencies request 
comment on any challenges banks may 
face in formulating the measure of 
trading loss as proposed, particularly 
for smaller portfolios. More specifically, 
which, if any, of the items to be 
excluded from a bank’s measure of 
trading loss (fees, commissions, 
reserves, intra-day trading, or net 
interest income) present difficulties and 
what is the nature of such difficulties? 
7. VaR-Based Capital Requirement 
Consistent with the current rule, 
section 5 of the proposed rule requires 
a bank to use one or more internal 
models to calculate a daily VaR-based 
measure that reflects general market risk 
for all covered positions. The daily VaR- 
based measure also may reflect the 
bank’s specific risk for one or more 
portfolios of debt or equity positions 
and must reflect the specific risk for any 
portfolios of correlation trading 
positions that are modeled under 
section 9 of the proposed rule. 
The proposal adds credit spread risk 
to the list of risk categories required to 
be captured in a bank’s VaR-based 
measure (that is, in addition to interest 
rate risk, equity price risk, foreign 
exchange rate risk, and commodity price 
risk). The VaR-based measure may 
incorporate empirical correlations 
within and across risk categories, 
provided the bank validates and justifies 
the reasonableness of its process for 
measuring correlations. If the VaR-based 
measure does not incorporate empirical 
correlations across risk categories, the 
bank must add the separate measures 
from its internal models used to 
calculate the VaR-based measure for the 
appropriate market risk categories to 
determine the bank’s aggregate VaR- 
based measure. The proposed rule 
continues to require models to include 
risks arising from the nonlinear price 
characteristics of option positions or 
positions with embedded optionality. 
Consistent with the 2009 revisions, 
under the proposed rule, a bank must be 
able to justify to the satisfaction of its 
primary Federal supervisor the omission 
of any risk factors from the calculation 
of its VaR-based measure that the bank 
includes in its pricing models. In 
addition, a bank must demonstrate to 
the satisfaction of its primary Federal 
supervisor the appropriateness of any 
proxies it uses to capture the risks of the 
bank’s actual positions for which such 
proxies are used. 
Quantitative Requirements for VaR- 
based Measure. The proposed rule 
includes the same quantitative 
requirements for the daily VaR-based 
measure as the current market risk 
capital rule. These include the one-tail, 
99.0 percent confidence level, a ten- 
business-day holding period, and a 
historical observation period of at least 
one year. 
To calculate VaR-based measures 
using a 10-day holding period, the bank 
may calculate 10-business-day measures 
directly, or may convert VaR-based 
measures using holding periods other 
than 10 business days to the equivalent 
of a 10-business-day holding period. A 
bank that converts its VaR-based 
measure in this manner must be able to 
justify the reasonableness of its 
approach to the satisfaction of its 
primary Federal supervisor. For 
example, a bank that computes its VaR- 
based measure by multiplying a daily 
VaR amount by the square root of 10 
(that is, using the square root of time) 
should demonstrate that daily changes 
in portfolio value do not exhibit 
significant mean reversion, 
autocorrelation, or volatility 
clustering.17 
The proposed rule requires a bank’s 
VaR-based measure to be based on data 
relevant to the bank’s actual exposures 
and of sufficient quality to support the 
calculation of risk-based capital 
requirements. The bank must update 
data sets at least monthly, or more 
frequently as changes in market 
conditions or portfolio composition 
warrant. For banks that use a weighting 
scheme or other method for identifying 
the historical observation period, the 
bank must either: (i) Use an effective 
observation period of at least one year 
in which the average time lag of the 
observations is at least six months; or 
(ii) demonstrate to its primary Federal 
supervisor that the method used is more 
effective than that described in (i) at 
representing the volatility of the bank’s 
trading portfolio over a full business 
cycle. In the latter case, a bank must 
update its data more frequently than 
monthly and in a manner appropriate 
for the type of weighting scheme. In 
general, a bank using a weighting 
scheme should update its data daily. 
Because the most recent observations 
typically are the most heavily weighted 
it is important to include these 
observations in the bank’s VaR-based 
measure. 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
retain and make available to its primary 
Federal supervisor model performance 
information on significant subportfolios. 
Taking into account the value and 
composition of a bank’s covered 
positions, the subportfolios must be 
sufficiently granular to inform a bank 
and its supervisor about the ability of 
the bank’s VaR model to reflect risk 
factors appropriately. A bank’s primary 
Federal supervisor must approve the 
number of subportfolios it uses for 
subportfolio backtesting. While the 
proposed rule does not prescribe the 
basis for determining significant 
subportfolios, the primary Federal 
supervisor may consider the bank’s 
evaluation of certain factors such as 
trading volume, product types and 
number of distinct traded products, 
business lines, and number of traders or 
trading desks. 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
retain and make available to its primary 
Federal supervisor, with no less than a 
60 day lag, information for each 
subportfolio for each business day over 
the previous two years (500 business 
days) that includes (i) A daily VaR- 
based measure for the subportfolio 
calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 percent 
confidence level; (ii) the daily profit or 
loss for the subportfolio (that is, the net 
change in price of the positions held in 
the portfolio at the end of the previous 
business day); and (iii) the p-value of 
the profit or loss on each day (that is, 
the probability of observing a loss 
greater than reported in (ii) above, based 
on the model used to calculate the VaR- 
based measure described in (i) above). 
Daily information on the probability 
of observing a loss greater than that 
which occurred on any day is a useful 
metric for banks and supervisors to 
assess the quality of a bank’s VaR 
model. For example, if a bank that used 
a historical simulation VaR model using 
the most recent 500 business days

18 See Section 2, ‘‘Definitions,’’ of the proposed 
rule for a full definition of a term repo-style 
transaction. 
experienced a loss equal to the second 
worst day of the 500, it would assign a 
probability of 0.004 (2/500) to that loss 
based on its VaR model. Applying this 
process over a given period provides 
information about the adequacy of the 
VaR model’s ability to characterize the 
whole distribution of losses, including 
information on the size and number of 
backtesting exceptions. The requirement 
to create and retain this information at 
the subportfolio level may help identify 
particular products or business lines for 
which the model is not adequately 
measuring risk. 
Question 6: The agencies request 
comment on what, if any, challenges 
exist with the proposed subportfolio 
backtesting requirements described 
above. How might banks determine 
significant subportfolios of covered 
positions that would be subject to these 
requirements? What basis could be used 
to determine an appropriate number of 
subportfolios? Is the p-value a useful 
statistic for evaluating the efficacy of a 
bank’s VaR model in gauging market 
risk? What, if any, other statistics should 
the agencies consider and why? 
The current market risk capital rule 
requires a bank to include in its VaR- 
based measure only covered positions. 
In contrast, the proposed rule allows a 
bank to include term repo-style 
transactions in its VaR-based measure 
even though these positions may not 
meet the definition of a covered 
position, provided the bank includes all 
such term repo-style transactions 
consistently over time. Under the 
proposed rule, a term repo-style 
transaction is a repurchase or reverse 
repurchase transaction, or a securities 
borrowing or securities lending 
transaction, including a transaction in 
which the bank acts as agent for a 
customer and indemnifies the customer 
against loss, that has an original 
maturity in excess of one business day, 
provided that it meets certain 
requirements, including being based 
solely on liquid and readily marketable 
securities or cash and subject to daily 
marking-to-market and daily margin 
maintenance requirements.18 While 
repo-style transactions typically are 
close adjuncts to trading activities, 
GAAP traditionally has not permitted 
companies to report them as trading 
assets or trading liabilities. Repo-style 
transactions included in the VaR-based 
measure will continue to be subject to 
the requirements of the credit risk 
capital rules for calculating capital for 
counterparty credit risk. 
8. Stressed VaR-based Capital 
Requirement 
Under section 6 of the proposed rule, 
a bank must calculate at least weekly a 
stressed VaR-based measure using the 
same internal model(s) used to calculate 
its VaR-based measure. The stressed 
VaR-based measure supplements the 
VaR-based measure, which, due to 
inherent limitations, proved inadequate 
in producing capital requirements 
appropriate to the level of losses 
incurred at many banks during the 
financial market crisis that began in 
mid-2007. The stressed VaR-based 
measure mitigates the procyclicality of 
the minimum capital requirements for 
market risk and contributes to a more 
appropriate measure of the risks of a 
bank’s covered positions. 
Quantitative Requirements for 
Stressed VaR-based Measure. To 
determine the stressed VaR-based 
measure, a bank must use the same 
model(s) used to calculate its VaR-based 
measure, but with model inputs 
calibrated to reflect historical data from 
a continuous 12-month period that 
reflects a period of significant financial 
stress appropriate to the bank’s current 
portfolio. The stressed VaR-based 
measure must be calculated at least 
weekly and be no less than the bank’s 
VaR-based measure. The agencies 
generally expect that a bank’s stressed 
VaR-based measure will be substantially 
greater than its VaR-based measure. 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
have policies and procedures that 
describe how it determines the period of 
significant financial stress used to 
calculate the bank’s stressed VaR-based 
measure, and to be able to provide 
empirical support for the period used. 
These policies and procedures must 
address (i) how the bank links the 
period of significant financial stress 
used to calculate the stressed VaR-based 
measure to the composition and 
directional bias of the bank’s current 
portfolio; and (ii) the bank’s process for 
selecting, reviewing, and updating the 
period of significant financial stress 
used to calculate the stressed VaR-based 
measure and for monitoring the 
appropriateness of the 12-month period 
in light of the bank’s current portfolio. 
The bank must obtain the prior approval 
of its primary Federal supervisor for, 
and notify its primary Federal 
supervisor if the bank makes any 
material changes to, these policies and 
procedures. A bank’s primary Federal 
supervisor may require it to use a 
different period of significant financial 
stress in the calculation of the bank’s 
stressed VaR-based measure. 
9. Revised Modeling Standards for 
Specific Risk 
The proposed rule more clearly 
specifies the modeling standards for 
specific risk and eliminates the current 
option for a bank to model some but not 
all material aspects of specific risk for 
an individual portfolio of debt or equity 
positions. As under the current market 
risk capital rule, a bank may use one or 
more internal models to measure the 
specific risk of a portfolio of debt or 
equity positions with specific risk. A 
bank must also use one or more internal 
models to measure the specific risk of a 
portfolio of correlation trading positions 
with specific risk that are modeled 
under section 9 of the proposed rule. A 
bank may not, however, model the 
specific risk of securitization positions 
that are not modeled under section 9 of 
the proposed rule. This treatment 
addresses regulatory arbitrage 
opportunities as well as deficiencies in 
the modeling of securitization positions 
that became more evident during the 
course of the financial market crisis that 
began in mid-2007. 
Under the proposed rule, the internal 
models must explain the historical price 
variation in the portfolio, be responsive 
to changes in market conditions, be 
robust to an adverse environment, and 
capture all material aspects of specific 
risk for the debt and equity positions. 
Specifically, the proposed revisions 
require that a bank’s internal models 
capture event risk and idiosyncratic 
risk; capture and demonstrate 
sensitivity to material differences 
between positions that are similar but 
not identical; and capture and 
demonstrate sensitivity to changes in 
portfolio composition and 
concentrations. If a bank calculates an 
incremental risk measure for a portfolio 
of debt or equity positions under section 
8 of the proposed rule, the bank is not 
required to capture default and credit 
migration risks in its internal models 
used to measure the specific risk of 
those portfolios. 
Under the current market risk capital 
rule, if a bank incorporates specific risk 
in its internal model but fails to 
demonstrate to its primary Federal 
supervisor that its internal model 
adequately measures all aspects of 
specific risk for a portfolio of debt and 
equity positions, the bank is subject to 
an internal models-based specific risk 
add-on for that portfolio. In contrast, the 
proposed rule requires a bank that does 
not have an approved internal model 
that captures all material aspects of 
specific risk for a particular portfolio of

1901 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
debt, equity, or correlation trading 
positions to use the standardized 
measurement method (described in 
section 10 of the proposed rule) to 
calculate a specific risk add-on for that 
portfolio. This proposed change reflects 
the agencies’ interest in creating 
incentives for more robust specific risk 
modeling. Due to concerns about the 
ability of a bank to model the specific 
risk of certain securitization positions, 
the proposed rule requires a bank to 
calculate a specific risk add-on under 
the standardized measurement method 
for all of its securitization positions that 
are not correlation trading positions 
modeled under section 9 of the 
proposed rule. The agencies note that 
not all debt, equity, or securitization 
positions have specific risk (for 
example, certain interest rate swaps). 
Under the proposed rule, there is no 
specific risk capital requirement for 
positions without specific risk. A bank 
should have clear policies and 
procedures for determining whether a 
position has specific risk. 
While the proposed rule continues to 
provide for flexibility and a 
combination of approaches to measure 
market risk, including the use of 
different models to measure the general 
market risk and the specific risk of one 
or more portfolios of debt and equity 
positions, the agencies strongly 
encourage banks to develop and 
implement models that integrate the 
measurement of VaR for general market 
risk and specific risk. A bank’s use of a 
combination of approaches would be 
subject to supervisory review to ensure 
that the overall capital requirement for 
market risk is commensurate with the 
risks of the bank’s covered positions. 
10. Standardized Specific Risk Capital 
Requirement 
The proposed rule requires a bank to 
calculate a total specific risk add-on for 
each portfolio of debt and equity 
positions for which the bank’s VaR- 
based measure does not capture all 
material aspects of specific risk and for 
each of its securitization positions that 
is not modeled under section 9 of the 
proposed rule. A bank must calculate 
each specific risk add-on in accordance 
with the requirements of the proposed 
rule. The bank must add the total 
specific risk add-on for each portfolio of 
positions to the bank’s measure for 
market risk. The specific risk add-on for 
an individual debt or securitization 
position that represents purchased 
credit protection is capped at the market 
value of the protection. 
For debt, equity, and securitization 
positions that are derivatives with linear 
payoffs (for example, futures, equity 
swaps), a bank must apply a risk 
weighting factor to the market value of 
the effective notional amount of the 
underlying instrument or index 
portfolio. For debt, equity, and 
securitization positions that are 
derivatives with nonlinear payoffs (for 
example, options, interest rate caps, 
tranched positions), a bank must apply 
a risk weighting factor to the market 
value of the effective notional amount of 
the underlying instrument or portfolio 
multiplied by the derivative’s delta (that 
is, the change of the derivative’s value 
relative to changes in the price of the 
reference exposure). For a standard 
interest rate derivative, the effective 
notional amount refers to the apparent 
or stated notional principal amount. If 
the contract contains a multiplier or 
other leverage enhancement, the 
apparent or stated notional principal 
amount must be adjusted to reflect the 
effect of the multiplier or leverage 
enhancement in order to determine the 
effective notional amount. A swap must 
be included as an effective notional 
position in the underlying debt, equity, 
or securitization instrument or portfolio, 
with the receiving side treated as a long 
position and the paying side treated as 
a short position. Consistent with the 
current rules, a bank may net long and 
short positions (including derivatives) 
in identical issues or identical indices. 
A bank may also net positions in 
depositary receipts against an opposite 
position in an identical equity in 
different markets, provided that the 
bank includes the costs of conversion. 
The proposed rule also expands the 
recognition of hedging effects for debt 
and securitization positions. A set of 
transactions consisting of either a debt 
position and its credit derivative hedge 
or a securitization position and its credit 
derivative hedge has a specific risk add- 
on of zero if the debt or securitization 
position is fully hedged by a total return 
swap (or similar instrument where there 
is a matching of payments and changes 
in market value of the position) and 
there is an exact match between the 
reference obligation, the maturity, and 
the currency of the swap and the debt 
or securitization position. 
If a set of transactions consisting of 
either a debt position and its credit 
derivative hedge or a securitization 
position and its credit derivative hedge 
does not meet the criteria for no specific 
risk add-on, the specific risk add-on for 
the set of transactions is equal to 20.0 
percent of the specific risk add-on for 
the side of the transaction with the 
higher specific risk add-on, provided 
that the credit risk of the position is 
fully hedged by a credit default swap (or 
similar instrument), and there is an 
exact match between the reference 
obligation of the credit derivative hedge 
and the debt or securitization position, 
the maturity of the credit derivative 
hedge and the debt or securitization 
position, and the currency of the credit 
derivative hedge and the debt or 
securitization position. For a set of 
transactions that consists of either a 
debt position and its credit derivative 
hedge or a securitization position and 
its credit derivative hedge that does not 
meet the criteria for full offset or the 
80.0 percent offset described above (for 
example, there is mismatch in the 
maturity of the credit derivative hedge 
and that of the debt or securitization 
position), but in which all or 
substantially all of the price risk has 
been hedged, the specific risk add-on is 
equal to the specific risk add-on for the 
side of the transaction with the larger 
specific risk add-on. 
Debt and Securitization Positions. 
While most securitization positions are 
considered debt positions under the 
current market risk capital rule, the 
agencies distinguish between 
securitization positions and debt 
positions in the proposed rule because 
of new proposed requirements that are 
uniquely applicable to securitization 
positions. Under the proposed rule, the 
total specific risk add-on for a portfolio 
of debt or securitization positions is the 
sum of the specific risk add-ons for 
individual debt or securitization 
positions, which are determined by 
multiplying the absolute value of the 
current market value of each net long or 
net short debt or securitization position 
by an appropriate risk-weighting factor 
for the position. 
The 2005 revisions to the market risk 
framework incorporated changes to the 
standardized measurement method used 
for calculating the specific risk add-ons 
for debt positions. For example, the 
‘‘government’’ category was expanded to 
include all sovereign debt, and the 
specific risk-weighting factor for 
sovereign debt was changed from zero 
percent to a range from zero to 12.0 
percent based on the external rating of 
the obligor and the remaining 
contractual maturity of the debt 
position. Table 1 below provides an 
illustrative representation of the specific 
risk-weighting factors applicable to debt 
positions in the ‘‘government,’’ 
‘‘qualifying,’’ and ‘‘other’’ categories 
under the market risk framework.

The 2009 revisions to the market risk

the specific risk-weighting factors under 
the standardized measurement method 
for rated securitization and re- 
securitization positions as well as other 
treatments for unrated securitization 
and re-securitization positions. For 
rated positions, the revisions apply risk 
weights according to whether the 
positions’ external rating represents a 
long-term credit rating or a short-term 
credit rating and generally apply higher 
risk weights to rated re-securitization 
positions than to other rated 
securitization positions. Tables 2 and 3 
below provide illustrative 
representations of the specific risk- 
weighting factors applicable to rated 
securitization and re-securitization

to address regulatory arbitrage 
opportunities as well as deficiencies in 
the modeling of securitization positions 
that became more evident during the 
course of the financial market crisis that 
began in mid-2007. This revised 
treatment also assigns a more risk- 
sensitive capital requirement to 
securitization positions than applied 
previously.

As a result of the recent enactment in 
the United States of the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act 19 (the Act), the agencies 
may not reference or require reliance on 
credit ratings in the assessment of the 
creditworthiness of a security or money 
market instrument. The Act provides 
that each Federal agency, after a 
required review of its regulations, must 
remove from each of its regulations any 
reference to or requirement of reliance 
on credit ratings and substitute a 
standard of creditworthiness the agency 
determines is appropriate for the 
regulation.20 
The 2005 and 2009 BCBS revisions 
include provisions that rely on credit 
ratings for determining the specific risk- 
weighting factors for debt, 
securitization, and re-securitization 
positions. These provisions would need 
to be revised when implemented in the 
U.S. in order to conform to the Act. The 
agencies acknowledge that the specific 
risk treatment for debt, securitization 
and re-securitization positions outlined 
in Tables 1 through 3 would provide a 
more risk-sensitive treatment for these 
positions than exists under the current 
rule; however, pending the agencies’ 
development of appropriate standards of 
creditworthiness to replace use of credit 
ratings as required by the Act, the 
proposed rule retains as a placeholder 
the current rule’s method for 
determining specific risk add-ons 
applicable to debt and securitization 
positions. More specifically, the 
‘‘government,’’ ‘‘qualifying,’’ and ‘‘other’’ 
categories as described in the current 
market risk capital rule and associated 
risk-weighting factors would continue to 
apply to a bank’s debt and securitization 
positions until the agencies develop a 
substitute standard of creditworthiness 
to replace reliance on credit ratings. For 
completeness and to ensure uniformity 
of regulatory text across the agencies’ 
rules, the proposed rule includes in 
section 10(b) the current standardized 
measurement method for these 
positions. The agencies acknowledge 
the shortcomings of the current 
treatment and recognize that it will have 
to be amended in accordance with the 
requirements of the Act. To the extent 
possible, the amended treatment would 
seek to establish comparable capital 
requirements for the affected positions 
in order to ensure international 
consistency and competitive equity. At 
the same time, the agencies believe it is 
important to move forward with the 
revisions to the market risk rules 
contained in this proposal.21 
When the agencies determine a 
substitute standard of creditworthiness 
for external ratings as required by the 
Act, they intend to incorporate the new 
standard into their capital rules, 
including the market risk rule. The 
agencies are currently reviewing 
alternative approaches to the use of 
credit ratings across all of the agencies’ 
regulations and requirements with the 
goal of establishing a uniform 
alternative credit-worthiness standard. 
The agencies have asked for public 
input on this process through an 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking 
(ANPR).22 The agencies noted in the 
ANPR that in evaluating any standard of 
creditworthiness for purpose of 
determining risk-based capital 
requirements, the agencies will, to the 
extent practicable and consistent with 
the other objectives, consider whether 
the standard would: 
• Appropriately distinguish the credit 
risk associated with a particular 
exposure within an asset class; 
• Be sufficiently transparent, 
unbiased, replicable, and defined to 
allow banking organizations of varying 
size and complexity to arrive at the 
same assessment of creditworthiness for 
similar exposures and to allow for 
appropriate supervisory review; 
• Provide for the timely and accurate 
measurement of negative and positive 
changes in creditworthiness; 
• Minimize opportunities for 
regulatory capital arbitrage; 
• Be reasonably simple to implement 
and not add undue burden on banking 
organizations; and 
• Foster prudent risk management. 
Question 7: What specific standards 
of creditworthiness that meet the 
agencies’ suggested criteria for a 
creditworthiness standard outlined 
above should the agencies consider for 
these positions? 
Under the proposed rule, the total 
specific risk add-on for a portfolio of 
nth-to-default credit derivatives is the 
sum of the specific risk add-ons for 
individual nth-to-default credit 
derivatives, as computed therein. A 
bank must calculate a specific risk add- 
on for each nth-to-default credit 
derivative position regardless of 
whether the bank is a net protection 
buyer or net protection seller. 
For first-to-default credit derivatives, 
the specific risk add-on is the lesser of 
(i) the sum of the specific risk add-ons 
for the individual reference credit 
exposures in the group of reference 
exposures, and (ii) the maximum 
possible credit event payment under the 
credit derivative contract. Where a bank 
has a risk position in one of the 
reference credit exposures underlying a 
first-to-default credit derivative and this 
credit derivative hedges the bank’s risk 
position, the bank is allowed to reduce 
both the specific risk add-on for the 
reference credit exposure and that part 
of the specific risk add-on for the credit 
derivative that relates to this particular 
reference credit exposure such that its 
specific risk add-on for the pair reflects 
the bank’s net position in the reference 
credit exposure. Where a bank has 
multiple risk positions in reference 
credit exposures underlying a first-to- 
default credit derivative, this offset is 
allowed only for the underlying

reference credit exposure having the 
lowest specific risk add-on. 
For second-or-subsequent-to-default 
credit derivatives, the specific risk add- 
on is the lesser of: (i) The sum of the 
specific risk add-ons for the individual 
reference credit exposures in the group 
of reference exposures, but disregarding 
the (n–1) obligations with the lowest 
specific risk add-ons; or (ii) the 
maximum possible credit event 
payment under the credit derivative 
contract. For second-or-subsequent-to- 
default credit derivatives, no offset of 
the specific risk add-on with an 
underlying reference credit exposure is 
allowed under the proposed rule. 
Equity Positions. Under the proposed 
rule, the total specific risk add-on for a 
portfolio of equity positions is the sum 
of the specific risk add-ons of the 
individual equity positions, which are 
determined by multiplying the absolute 
value of the current market value of 
each net long or short equity position by 
an appropriate risk-weighting factor. 
The proposed rule retains the specific 
risk add-ons applicable to equity 
positions under the current market risk 
capital rule, with one exception. 
Consistent with the 2009 revisions, the 
proposed rule eliminates the provision 
that allows a bank to apply a specific 
risk-weighting factor of 4.0 to an equity 
position held in a portfolio that is both 
liquid and well-diversified. Instead, a 
bank must multiply the absolute value 
of the current market value of each net 
long or short equity position by a risk- 
weighting factor of 8.0 percent. For 
equity positions that are index contracts 
comprising a well-diversified portfolio 
of equity instruments, the absolute 
value of the current market value of 
each net long or short position is 
multiplied by a risk-weighting factor of 
2.0 percent. A portfolio is well- 
diversified if it contains a large number 
of individual equity positions, with no 
single position representing a 
substantial portion of the portfolio’s 
total market value. 
The proposed rule retains the specific 
risk treatment in the current market risk 
capital rule for equity positions arising 
from futures-related arbitrage strategies 
where long and short positions are in 
exactly the same index at different dates 
or in different market centers, or where 
long and short positions are in index 
contracts at the same date in different 
but similar indices. The proposed rule 
also retains the current treatment for 
futures contracts on main indices that 
are matched by offsetting positions in a 
basket of stocks comprising the index. 
Due Diligence Requirements for 
Securitization Positions. The proposed 
rule incorporates requirements from the 
2009 revisions that banks perform due 
diligence on securitization positions. 
The due diligence requirements apply to 
all securitization positions and 
emphasize the need for banks to 
conduct their own due diligence of 
borrower creditworthiness, in addition 
to any use of third-party assessments, 
and not place undue reliance on 
external credit ratings. 
In order to meet the proposed due 
diligence requirements, a bank must be 
able to demonstrate, to the satisfaction 
of its primary Federal supervisor, a 
comprehensive understanding of the 
features of a securitization position that 
would materially affect the performance 
of the bank’s securitization position. 
The bank’s analysis must be 
commensurate with the complexity of 
the securitization position and the 
materiality of the position in relation to 
capital. 
To support the demonstration of its 
comprehensive understanding, for each 
securitization position, the bank must 
conduct and document an analysis of 
the risk characteristics of a 
securitization position prior to acquiring 
the position, considering: (i) Structural 
features of the securitization that would 
materially impact the performance of 
the position, for example, the 
contractual cash flow waterfall, 
waterfall-related triggers, credit 
enhancements, liquidity enhancements, 
market value triggers, the performance 
of organizations that service the 
position, and deal-specific definitions of 
default; (ii) relevant information 
regarding the performance of the 
underlying credit exposure(s), for 
example, the percentage of loans 30, 60, 
and 90 days past due; default rates; 
prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; 
property types; occupancy; average 
credit score or other measures of 
creditworthiness; average LTV ratio; and 
industry and geographic diversification 
data on the underlying exposure(s); (iii) 
relevant market data of the 
securitization, for example, bid-ask 
spreads, most recent sales price and 
historical price volatility, trading 
volume, implied market rating, and size, 
depth and concentration level of the 
market for the securitization; and (iii) 
for resecuritization positions, 
performance information on the 
underlying securitization exposures, for 
example, the issuer name and credit 
quality, and the characteristics and 
performance of the exposures 
underlying the securitization exposures. 
On an on-going basis, but no less 
frequently than quarterly, the bank must 
also evaluate, review, and update as 
appropriate the analysis required above 
for each securitization position. 
Question 8: What, if any, specific 
challenges are involved with meeting 
the proposed due diligence 
requirements and for what types of 
securitization positions? How might the 
agencies address these challenges while 
still ensuring that a bank conducts an 
appropriate level of due diligence 
commensurate with the risks of its 
covered positions? For example, would 
it be appropriate to scale the 
requirements according to a position’s 
expected holding period? How would 
such scaling affect a bank’s ability to 
demonstrate a comprehensive 
understanding of the risk characteristics 
of a securitization position? What are 
the benefits and drawbacks of requiring 
public disclosures regarding a bank’s 
processes for performing due diligence 
on its securitization positions? 
The agencies are considering 
alternative methodologies to the 
standardized measurement method for 
determining the specific risk capital 
requirement for securitization positions 
to better recognize the risk reduction 
benefits of hedging. Conceptually, such 
a methodology could recognize some 
degree of offsetting between positions 
that reference the same pool of assets 
but have different levels of seniority, or 
between positions that reference similar 
but not identical assets. For example, it 
could use a formulaic approach to 
determine a degree of offset between 
securitization positions that are similar 
to an index. Inputs to the formula could 
include factors such as the attachment 
and detachment points of an individual 
securitization position, the aggregate 
capital requirement of its underlying 
exposures, and the percentage of 
underlying obligors common to the 
securitization exposure and the index. 
Question 9: What alternative non- 
models-based methodologies could the 
agencies use to determine the specific 
risk add-ons for securitization 
positions? Please provide specific 
details on the mechanics of and 
rationale for any suggested 
methodology. Please also describe how 
the methodology conservatively 
recognizes some degree of hedging 
benefits, yet captures the basis risk 
between non-identical positions. To 
what types of securitization positions 
would such a methodology apply and 
why?

1905 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
(incremental risk model). Incremental 
risk consists of the default risk of a 
position (that is, the risk of loss on the 
position upon an event of default (for 
example, the failure of the obligor to 
make timely payments of principal or 
interest), including bankruptcy, 
insolvency, or similar proceeding) and 
the credit migration risk of a position 
(that is, price risk that arises from 
significant changes in the underlying 
credit quality of the position). 
With the prior approval of its primary 
Federal supervisor, a bank may also 
include portfolios of equity positions in 
its incremental risk model, provided 
that it consistently includes such equity 
positions in a manner that is consistent 
with how the bank internally measures 
and manages the incremental risk for 
such positions at the portfolio level. 
Default is deemed to occur with respect 
to any equity position that is included 
in the bank’s incremental risk model 
upon the default of any debt of the 
issuer of the equity position. A bank 
may not include correlation trading 
positions or securitization positions in 
its incremental risk model. 
Under the proposed rule, a bank’s 
model to measure the incremental risk 
of a portfolio of debt positions (and 
equity positions, if applicable) must 
meet certain requirements and be 
approved by the bank’s primary Federal 
supervisor before the bank may use it to 
calculate its risk-based capital 
requirement. The model must measure 
incremental risk over a one-year time 
horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 percent 
confidence level, either under the 
assumption of a constant level of risk, 
or under the assumption of constant 
positions. 
The liquidity horizon of a position is 
the time that would be required for a 
bank to reduce its exposure to, or hedge 
all of the material risks of, the 
position(s) in a stressed market. The 
liquidity horizon for a position may not 
be less than the lower of three months 
or the contractual maturity of the 
position. 
A position’s liquidity horizon is a key 
risk attribute for purposes of calculating 
the incremental risk measure because it 
puts a bank’s overall risk exposure to an 
actively managed portfolio into context. 
Positions with longer (that is, less 
liquid) liquidity horizons are more 
difficult to hedge and result in more 
exposure to both default and credit 
migration risk over any fixed time 
horizon. In particular, two positions 
with differing liquidity horizons but 
exactly the same amount of default risk 
if held in a static portfolio over a one- 
year horizon may exhibit significantly 
different amounts of default risk if held 
in a dynamic portfolio in which hedging 
can occur in response to observable 
changes in credit quality. The position 
with the shorter liquidity horizon can be 
hedged more rapidly and with less cost 
in the event of a change in credit 
quality, which leads to a different 
exposure to default risk over a one-year 
horizon than the position with the 
longer liquidity horizon. 
A constant level of risk assumption 
assumes that the bank rebalances, or 
rolls over, its trading positions at the 
beginning of each liquidity horizon over 
a one-year horizon in a manner that 
maintains the bank’s initial risk level. 
The bank must determine the frequency 
of rebalancing in a manner consistent 
with the liquidity horizons of the 
positions in the portfolio. A constant 
position assumption assumes that a 
bank maintains the same set of positions 
throughout the one-year horizon. If a 
bank uses this assumption, it must do so 
consistently across all portfolios for 
which it models incremental risk. A 
bank has flexibility in whether it 
chooses to use a constant risk or 
constant position assumption in its 
incremental risk model; however, the 
agencies expect that the assumption will 
remain fairly constant once selected. As 
with any material change to modeling 
assumptions, the proposed rule requires 
a bank must promptly notify its primary 
Federal supervisor if the bank changes 
from a constant risk to a constant 
position assumption or vice versa. 
Further, to the extent a bank estimates 
a comprehensive risk measure under 
section 9 of the proposed rule, the 
bank’s selection of a constant position 
or a constant risk assumption must be 
consistent between the bank’s 
incremental risk model and 
comprehensive risk model. Similarly, 
the bank’s treatment of liquidity 
horizons must be consistent between a 
bank’s incremental risk model and 
comprehensive risk model. 
The proposed rule requires a bank’s 
incremental risk model to meet the 
conditions described below. The model 
must recognize the impact of 
correlations between default and credit 
migration events among obligors. In 
particular, the existence of an aggregate, 
economy-wide credit cycle implies 
some degree of correlation between the 
default and credit migration events 
across different issuers. The degree of 
correlation between default and credit 
migration events of different issuers 
may also depend on other issuer 
attributes such as industry sector or 
region of domicile. The model must also 
reflect the effect of issuer and market 
concentrations, as well as 
concentrations that can arise within and 
across product classes during stressed 
conditions. 
The bank’s incremental risk model 
must reflect netting only of long and 
short positions that reference the same 
financial instrument and must also 
reflect any material mismatch between a 
position and its hedge. Examples of 
such mismatches include maturity 
mismatches as well as mismatches 
between an underlying position and its 
hedge, (for example, the use of an index 
position to hedge a single name 
security). 
The bank’s incremental risk model 
must also recognize the effect that 
liquidity horizons have on hedging 
strategies. When a bank’s hedging 
strategy requires continual rebalancing 
of the hedge position, the constraints on 
rebalancing imposed by the liquidity 
horizon of the hedge must be 
recognized. As an example, if a position 
is being hedged with an instrument with 
a liquidity horizon of three months, no 
rebalancing of the hedge can occur 
within a three month period. 
Accordingly, any divergence in the 
value of the position and its hedge that 
occurs because the hedge cannot be 
rebalanced within the three month 
liquidity horizon must be recognized. 
Moreover, in order to reflect the effect 
of hedging in the incremental risk 
measure, the bank must (i) Choose to 
model the rebalancing of the hedge 
consistently over the relevant set of 
trading positions; (ii) demonstrate that 
the inclusion of rebalancing results in a 
more appropriate risk measurement; (iii) 
demonstrate that the market for the 
hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit 
rebalancing during periods of stress; and 
(iv) capture in the incremental risk 
model any residual risks arising from 
such hedging strategies. 
The incremental risk model must 
reflect the nonlinear impact of options 
and other positions with material 
nonlinear behavior with respect to 
default and credit migration changes. In 
light of the one-year horizon of the 
incremental risk measure and the 
extremely high confidence level 
required, it is important that 
nonlinearities be explicitly recognized. 
Price changes resulting from defaults or 
credit migrations can be large and the 
resulting nonlinear behavior of the 
position can be material. The bank’s 
incremental risk model must also 
maintain consistency with the bank’s 
internal risk management 
methodologies for identifying, 
measuring, and managing risk. 
A bank that calculates an incremental 
risk measure under section 8 of the 
proposed rule must calculate its 
incremental risk capital requirement at

least weekly. This capital requirement is 
the greater of: (i) The average of the 
incremental risk measures over the 
previous 12 weeks; or (ii) the most 
recent incremental risk measure. 
12. Comprehensive Risk Capital 
Requirement 
Under section 9 of the proposed rule, 
with its primary Federal supervisor’s 
prior approval, a bank may measure all 
material price risks of one or more 
portfolios of correlation trading 
positions (comprehensive risk measure) 
using a model (comprehensive risk 
model). If the bank uses a 
comprehensive risk model for a 
portfolio of correlation trading 
positions, the bank must also measure 
the specific risk of that portfolio using 
internal models that meet the 
requirements in section 7(b) of the 
proposed rule. If the bank does not use 
a comprehensive risk model to calculate 
the price risk of a portfolio of 
correlation trading positions, it must 
calculate a specific risk add-on for the 
portfolio under section 7(c) of the 
proposed rule, determined using the 
standardized measurement method for 
specific risk described in section 10 of 
the proposed rule. 
A bank’s comprehensive risk model 
must meet several requirements under 
the proposed rule. The model must 
measure comprehensive risk (that is, all 
price risk) consistent with a one-year 
time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 
percent confidence level, under the 
assumption of either a constant level of 
risk or constant positions. As mentioned 
under the incremental risk measure 
discussion, while a bank has flexibility 
in whether it chooses to use a constant 
risk or constant position assumption, 
the agencies expect that the assumption 
will remain fairly constant once 
selected. The bank’s selection of a 
constant position assumption or a 
constant risk assumption must be 
consistent between the bank’s 
comprehensive risk model and its 
incremental risk model. Similarly, the 
bank’s treatment of liquidity horizons 
must be consistent between the bank’s 
comprehensive risk model and its 
incremental risk model. 
The proposed rule requires that a 
bank’s comprehensive risk model 
capture all material price risk of 
included positions, including, but not 
limited to: (i) The risk associated with 
the contractual structure of cash flows 
of the position, its issuer, and its 
underlying exposures (for example, the 
risk arising from multiple defaults, 
including the ordering of defaults, in 
tranched products); (ii) credit spread 
risk, including nonlinear price risks; 
(iii) volatility of implied correlations, 
including nonlinear price risks such as 
the cross-effect between spreads and 
correlations; (iv) basis risks (for 
example, the basis between the spread 
of an index and the spread on its 
constituents and the basis between 
implied correlation of an index tranche 
and that of a bespoke tranche); (v) 
recovery rate volatility as it relates to 
the propensity for recovery rates to 
affect tranche prices; and (vi) to the 
extent the comprehensive risk measure 
incorporates benefits from dynamic 
hedging, the static nature of the hedge 
over the liquidity horizon. 
The risks above have been identified 
as risks that are particularly important 
for correlation trading positions; 
however, the comprehensive risk model 
is intended to capture all material price 
risks related to those correlation trading 
positions that are included in the 
comprehensive risk model. Accordingly, 
additional risks that are not explicitly 
discussed above but are a material 
source of price risk must be included in 
the comprehensive risk model. 
The proposed rule also requires that 
a bank have sufficient market data to 
ensure that it fully captures the material 
price risks of the correlation trading 
positions in its comprehensive risk 
measure. Moreover, the bank must be 
able to demonstrate that its model is an 
appropriate representation of 
comprehensive risk in light of the 
historical price variation of its 
correlation trading positions. The 
agencies will scrutinize the positions a 
bank identifies as correlation trading 
positions and will also review whether 
the correlation trading positions have 
sufficient market data available to 
support reliable modeling of material 
risks. If there is insufficient market data 
to support reliable modeling for certain 
positions (such as new products), the 
agencies may require the bank to 
exclude these positions from the 
comprehensive risk model and, instead, 
require the bank to calculate specific 
risk add-ons for these positions under 
the standardized measurement method 
for specific risk. Again, the proposed 
rule requires a bank to promptly notify 
its primary Federal supervisor if the 
bank plans to extend the use of a model 
that has been approved by the 
supervisor to an additional business line 
or product type. 
In addition to these requirements, a 
bank must at least weekly apply to its 
portfolio of correlation trading positions 
a set of specific, supervisory stress 
scenarios that capture changes in 
default rates, recovery rates, and credit 
spreads; correlations of underlying 
exposures; and correlations of a 
correlation trading position and its 
hedge. A bank must retain and make 
available to its primary supervisor the 
results of the supervisory stress testing, 
including comparisons with the capital 
requirements generated by the bank’s 
comprehensive risk model. A bank also 
must promptly report to its primary 
Federal supervisor any instances where 
the stress tests indicate any material 
deficiencies in the comprehensive risk 
model. 
The agencies are evaluating the 
appropriate bases for supervisory stress 
scenarios to be applied to a bank’s 
portfolio of correlation trading 
positions. There are inherent difficulties 
in prescribing stress scenarios that 
would be universally applicable and 
relevant across all banks and across all 
products contained in banks’ correlation 
trading portfolios. The agencies believe 
a level of comparability is important for 
assessing the sufficiency and 
appropriateness of banks’ 
comprehensive risk models, but also 
recognize that specific scenarios may 
not be relevant for certain products or 
for certain modeling approaches. The 
agencies are considering various options 
for stress scenarios, including an 
approach that would involve specifying 
stress scenarios based on credit spread 
shocks to certain correlation trading 
positions (for example, single-name 
CDSs, CDS indexes, index tranches), 
which may replicate historically 
observed spreads. Another approach 
would require a bank to calibrate its 
existing valuation model to certain 
specified stress periods by adjusting 
credit-related risk factors to reflect a 
given stress period. The credit-related 
risk factors, as adjusted, would then be 
used to revalue the bank’s correlation 
trading portfolio under one or more 
stress scenarios. 
Question 10: What are the benefits 
and drawbacks of the supervisory stress 
scenario requirements described above 
and what other specific stress scenario 
approaches for the correlation trading 
portfolio should the agencies consider? 
For which products and model types are 
widely applicable stress scenarios most 
appropriate, and for which product and 
model types is a more tailored stress 
scenario most appropriate? What other 
stress scenario approaches could 
consistently reflect the risks of the entire 
portfolio of correlation trading 
positions? 
The agencies have identified 
prudential challenges associated with 
relying solely on banks’ comprehensive 
risk models for determining risk-based 
capital requirements for correlation 
trading positions. For example, a bank’s 
ability to perform robust validation of

1907 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
its comprehensive risk model using 
standard backtesting methods is limited 
in light of the proposed requirements for 
the model to measure potential losses 
on correlation trading positions due to 
all price risk at a one-year time horizon 
and high-percentile confidence level. As 
a result, banks will need to use indirect 
model validation methods, such as 
stress tests, scenario analysis or other 
methods to assess their models. The 
agencies anticipate that banks’ 
comprehensive risk model validation 
approaches will evolve over time; 
however, to address near-term modeling 
challenges while still giving 
consideration to sound risk management 
practices, the agencies are proposing a 
floor on the modeled correlation trading 
position capital requirements in the 
form of a capital surcharge as described 
below. 
A bank approved to measure 
comprehensive risk for one or more 
portfolios of correlation trading 
positions must calculate at least weekly 
a comprehensive risk measure. The 
comprehensive risk measure equals the 
sum of the output from the bank’s 
approved comprehensive risk model 
plus a surcharge on the bank’s modeled 
correlation trading positions. The 
agencies propose setting the surcharge 
equal to 15.0 percent of the total specific 
risk add-on that would apply to the 
bank’s modeled correlation trading 
positions under the standardized 
measurement method for specific risk in 
section 10 of the proposed rule. 
The agencies propose that banks 
initially be required to calculate the 
comprehensive risk measure under the 
surcharge approach while banks and 
supervisors gain experience with the 
banks’ comprehensive risk models. Over 
time, with approval from its primary 
Federal supervisor, a bank may be 
permitted to use a floor approach to 
calculate its comprehensive risk 
measure as the greater of: (1) The output 
from the bank’s approved 
comprehensive risk model; or (2) 8.0 
percent of the total specific risk add-on 
that would apply to the bank’s modeled 
correlation trading positions under the 
standardized measurement method for 
specific risk, provided the bank has met 
the comprehensive risk modeling 
requirements in the proposed rule for a 
period of at least one year and can 
demonstrate the effectiveness of its 
comprehensive risk model through the 
results of ongoing validation efforts, 
including robust benchmarking. Such 
results may incorporate a comparison of 
the banks’ internal model results to 
those from an alternative model for 
certain portfolios and other relevant 
data. The agencies may also consider a 
benchmarking approach that uses banks’ 
internal models to determine capital 
requirements for a portfolio specified by 
the supervisors to allow for a relative 
assessment of models across banks. A 
bank’s primary Federal supervisor will 
monitor the appropriateness of the floor 
approach on an ongoing basis and may 
rescind its approval of this approach if 
it determines that the bank’s 
comprehensive risk model may not 
sufficiently reflect the risks of the bank’s 
modeled correlation trading positions. 
The agencies believe the proposed 
approach provides a prudential 
backstop on modeled capital 
requirements as well as appropriate 
incentives for ongoing model 
improvement. Another potential 
approach would be a stress-test based 
floor that would, for instance, require a 
bank to value its correlation trading 
positions using prescribed 
instantaneous price and correlation 
shocks in the models it uses to price its 
correlation trading positions. For 
example, such a floor could require a 
bank’s comprehensive risk capital 
requirement to be at least as great as the 
largest loss the bank would experience 
for its correlation trading positions 
under a scenario of instantaneous price 
changes for the underlying positions 
within a range of plus and minus 15.0 
percent combined with instantaneous 
correlation changes within a range of 
plus or minus 5.0 percent. 
Question 11: What, if any, specific 
challenges exist with respect to the 
proposed modeling requirements for 
correlation trading positions? What 
additional criteria and benchmarking 
methods should the agencies consider 
that would provide an objective basis for 
evaluating whether to allow a bank to 
apply a lower surcharge percentage in 
calculating its comprehensive risk 
measure? What are the advantages and 
disadvantages of the proposed floor 
approach and the other potential floor 
approaches described above? What 
other alternatives should the agencies 
consider to address the uncertainties 
identified above while ensuring safe and 
sound risk-based capital requirements 
for correlation trading positions? 
A bank that calculates a 
comprehensive risk measure under 
section 9 of the proposed rule must 
calculate its comprehensive risk capital 
requirement at least weekly. This capital 
requirement is the greater of (i) the 
average of the comprehensive risk 
measures over the previous 12 weeks; or 
(ii) the most recent comprehensive risk 
measure. Separate from the proposed 
requirements for calculating a 
comprehensive risk measure, as 
discussed previously, the proposed rule 
contains an explicit reservation of 
authority providing that a bank’s 
primary Federal supervisor may require 
a bank to assign a different risk-based 
capital requirement than would 
otherwise apply to a covered position or 
portfolio of covered positions that better 
reflects the risk of the position or 
portfolio. For example, regardless of a 
modeled capital requirement, a primary 
Federal supervisor may require a bank 
to increase its risk-weighted asset 
amount for correlation trading positions 
to ensure that it reflects the risk to 
which the bank is exposed. Because 
banks’ comprehensive risk models use 
many different methodologies, there is 
no uniform appropriate supervisory 
adjustment to risk-weighted assets. An 
adjustment may take the form of a 
multiplier, a floor, a fixed add-on, or 
another adjustment consistent with the 
risk of the portfolio and the bank’s 
modeling practices. 
13. Disclosure Requirements 
The proposed rule imposes disclosure 
requirements designed to increase 
transparency and improve market 
discipline on the top-tier consolidated 
legal entity that is subject to the market 
risk capital rule. The disclosure 
requirements, discussed further below, 
include a breakdown of certain 
components of a bank’s market risk 
capital requirement, information on a 
bank’s modeling approaches, and 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
relating to a bank’s securitization 
activities. 
The agencies recognize the 
importance of market discipline in 
encouraging sound risk management 
practices and fostering financial 
stability. With enhanced information, 
market participants can better evaluate 
a bank’s risk management performance, 
earnings potential, and financial 
strength. Many of the proposed 
disclosure requirements reflect 
information already disclosed publicly 
by the banking industry. A bank is 
encouraged, but not required, to make 
these disclosures in a central location 
on its web site. 
Consistent with the advanced 
approaches rules, the proposed rule 
requires a bank to comply with the 
disclosure requirements of section 11 of 
the proposed rule unless it is a 
consolidated subsidiary of another 
depository institution or bank holding 
company that is subject to the 
disclosure requirements. A bank subject 
to section 11 is required to adopt a 
formal disclosure policy approved by its 
board of directors that addresses the 
bank’s approach for determining the 
disclosures it makes. The policy must

24 See 13 CFR 121.201. 
address the associated internal controls 
and disclosure controls and procedures. 
The board of directors and senior 
management must ensure that 
appropriate verification of the bank’s 
disclosures takes place and that 
effective internal controls and 
disclosure controls and procedures are 
maintained. One or more senior officers 
is required to attest that the disclosures 
meet the requirements of the proposed 
rule, and the board of directors and 
senior management are responsible for 
establishing and maintaining an 
effective internal control structure over 
financial reporting, including the 
information required under section 11 
of the proposed rule. 
The proposed rule requires a bank, at 
least quarterly, to disclose publicly for 
each portfolio of covered positions (i) 
The high, low, median, and mean VaR- 
based measures over the reporting 
period and the VaR-based measure at 
period-end; (ii) the high, low, median, 
and mean stressed VaR-based measures 
over the reporting period and the 
stressed VaR-based measure at period- 
end; (iii) the high, low, median, and 
mean incremental risk capital 
requirements over the reporting period 
and the incremental risk capital 
requirement at period-end; (iv) the high, 
low, median, and mean comprehensive 
risk capital requirements over the 
reporting period and the comprehensive 
risk capital requirement at period-end; 
(v) separate measures for interest rate 
risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk, 
foreign exchange rate risk, and 
commodity price risk used to calculate 
the VaR-based measure; and (vi) a 
comparison of VaR-based measures with 
actual results and an analysis of 
important outliers. In addition, the bank 
must publicly disclose the following 
information at least quarterly: (i) The 
aggregate amount of on-balance sheet 
and off-balance sheet securitization 
positions by exposure type; and (ii) the 
aggregate amount of correlation trading 
positions. 
A bank is required to make qualitative 
disclosures at least annually, or more 
frequently in the event of material 
changes, of the following information 
for each portfolio of covered positions: 
(i) The composition of material 
portfolios of covered positions; (ii) the 
bank’s valuation policies, procedures, 
and methodologies for covered positions 
including, for securitization positions, 
the methods and key assumptions used 
for valuing such positions, any 
significant changes since the last 
reporting period, and the impact of such 
change; (iii) the characteristics of its 
internal models, including, for the 
bank’s incremental risk capital 
requirement and the comprehensive risk 
capital requirement, the approach used 
by the bank to determine liquidity 
horizons; the methodologies used to 
achieve a capital assessment that is 
consistent with the required soundness 
standard; and the specific approaches 
used in the validation of these models; 
(iv) a description of its approaches for 
validating the accuracy of its internal 
models and modeling processes; (v) a 
description of the stress tests applied to 
each market risk category; (vi) the 
results of a comparison of the bank’s 
internal estimates with actual outcomes 
during a sample period not used in 
model development; (vii) the soundness 
standard on which its internal capital 
adequacy assessment is based, including 
a description of the methodologies used 
to achieve a capital adequacy 
assessment that is consistent with the 
soundness standard and the 
requirements of the market risk capital 
rule; and (viii) a description of the 
bank’s processes for monitoring changes 
in the credit and market risk of 
securitization positions, including how 
those processes differ for 
resecuritization positions; and (ix) a 
description of the bank’s policy 
governing the use of credit risk 
mitigation to mitigate the risks of 
securitization and resecuritization 
positions. 
Question 12: The agencies seek 
comment on the effectiveness of the 
proposed disclosure requirements. 
What, if any, changes to these 
requirements would make the proposed 
disclosures more effective in promoting 
market discipline? 
III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq. (RFA), generally 
requires that, in connection with a 
notice of proposed rulemaking, an 
agency prepare and make available for 
public comment an initial regulatory 
flexibility analysis that describes the 
impact of a proposed rule on small 
entities.23 Under regulations issued by 
the Small Business Administration,24 a 
small entity includes a commercial bank 
or bank holding company with assets of 
$175 million or less (a small banking 
organization). As of June 30, 2010, there 
were approximately 2,561 small bank 
holding companies, 690 small national 
banks, 400 small state member banks, 
and 2,706 small state nonmember banks. 
The proposed rule would apply only 
if the bank holding company or bank 
has aggregated trading assets and 
trading liabilities equal to 10 percent or 
more of quarter-end total assets, or $1 
billion or more. No small banking 
organizations satisfy these criteria. 
Therefore, no small entities would be 
subject to this rule. 
IV. OCC Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act of 1995 Determination 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (UMRA) requires Federal 
agencies to prepare a budgetary impact 
statement before promulgating a rule 
that includes a Federal mandate that 
may result in the expenditure by state, 
local, and tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector of 
$100 million or more (adjusted annually 
for inflation) in any one year. The 
current inflation-adjusted expenditure 
threshold is $126.4 million. If a 
budgetary impact statement is required, 
section 205 of the UMRA also requires 
an agency to identify and consider a 
reasonable number of regulatory 
alternatives before promulgating a rule. 
In conducting the regulatory analysis, 
UMRA requires each Federal agency to 
provide: 
• The text of the draft regulatory 
action, together with a reasonably 
detailed description of the need for the 
regulatory action and an explanation of 
how the regulatory action will meet that 
need; 
• An assessment of the potential costs 
and benefits of the regulatory action, 
including an explanation of the manner 
in which the regulatory action is 
consistent with a statutory mandate and, 
to the extent permitted by law, promotes 
the President’s priorities and avoids 
undue interference with State, local, 
and tribal governments in the exercise 
of their governmental functions; 
• An assessment, including the 
underlying analysis, of benefits 
anticipated from the regulatory action 
(such as, but not limited to, the 
promotion of the efficient functioning of 
the economy and private markets, the 
enhancement of health and safety, the 
protection of the natural environment, 
and the elimination or reduction of 
discrimination or bias) together with, to 
the extent feasible, a quantification of 
those benefits; 
• An assessment, including the 
underlying analysis, of costs anticipated 
from the regulatory action (such as, but 
not limited to, the direct cost both to the 
government in administering the 
regulation and to businesses and others 
in complying with the regulation, and 
any adverse effects on the efficient 
functioning of the economy, private 
markets (including productivity, 
employment, and competitiveness), 
health, safety, and the natural 
environment), together with, to the

1909 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
25 The following are the components of the 
current Market Risk Measure. Value-at-Risk (VaR) 
is an estimate of the maximum amount that the 
value of one or more positions could decline due 
to market price or rate movements during a fixed 
holding period within a stated confidence interval. 
Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that 
could result from factors other than broad market 
movements and includes event risk, default risk, 
and idiosyncratic risk. There may also be a capital 
requirement for de minimis exposures, if any, that 
are not included in the bank’s VaR models. 
26 Unless otherwise noted, the population of 
banks used in this analysis consists of all FDIC- 
insured national banks and uninsured national 
bank and trust companies. Banking organizations 
are aggregated to the top holding company level. 
27 A national banking organization is any bank 
holding company with a subsidiary national bank. 
28 The report, ‘‘Analysis of the third trading book 
impact study’’, is available at http://www.bis.org/ 
publ/bcbs163.htm. The study gathered data from 43 
banks in 10 countries, including six banks from the 
United States. 
extent feasible, a quantification of those 
costs; and 
• An assessment, including the 
underlying analysis, of costs and 
benefits of potentially effective and 
reasonably feasible alternatives to the 
planned regulation, identified by the 
agencies or the public (including 
improving the current regulation and 
reasonably viable nonregulatory 
actions), and an explanation why the 
planned regulatory action is preferable 
to the identified potential alternatives. 
• An estimate of any disproportionate 
budgetary effects of the Federal mandate 
upon any particular regions of the 
nation or particular State, local, or tribal 
governments, urban or rural or other 
types of communities, or particular 
segments of the private sector. 
• An estimate of the effect the 
rulemaking action may have on the 
national economy, if the OCC 
determines that such estimates are 
reasonably feasible and that such effect 
is relevant and material. 
A. The Need for the Regulatory Action 
The proposed rule would modify the 
current market risk capital rule by 
adjusting the minimum risk-based 
capital calculation and adding public 
disclosure requirements. The proposed 
rule would also (1) modify the 
definition of covered positions to 
include assets that are in the trading 
book and held with the intent to trade; 
(2) introduce new requirements for the 
identification of trading positions and 
the management of covered positions; 
and (3) require banks to have clearly 
defined policies and procedures for 
actively managing all covered positions, 
for the prudent valuation of covered 
positions and for specific internal model 
validation standards. The proposed rule 
will generally apply to any bank with 
aggregate trading assets and liabilities 
that are at least 10 percent of total assets 
or at least $1 billion. These thresholds 
are the same as those currently used to 
determine applicability of the market 
risk rule. 
Under current rules, the measure for 
market risk is as follows: 25 
Market Risk Measure = (Value-at-Risk 
based capital requirement) + 
(Specific risk capital requirement) + 
(Capital requirement for de minimis 
exposures) 
Under the proposed rule, the new 
market risk measure would be as 
follows (new risk measure components 
are underlined): 
New Market Risk Measure = (Value-at- 
Risk based capital requirement) + 
(Stressed Value-at-Risk based 
capital requirement) + (Specific risk 
capital charge) + (Incremental risk 
capital requirement) + 
(Comprehensive risk capital 
requirement) + (Capital charge for 
de minimis exposures) 
The Basel Committee and the Federal 
banking agencies designed the new 
components of the market risk measure 
to capture key risks overlooked by the 
current market risk measure. 
B. Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Proposed 
Rule 
1. Organizations Affected by the 
Proposed Rule 26 
According to September 30, 2010, Call 
Report data, 16 national banking 
organizations 27 had trading assets and 
liabilities that are at least 10 percent of 
total assets or at least $1 billion. 
2. Impact of the Proposed Rule 
The key benefits of the proposed rule 
are the following qualitative benefits: 
• Enhances sensitivity to market risk, 
• Enhances modeling requirements 
consistent with advances in risk 
management, 
• Better captures trading positions for 
which market risk capital treatment is 
appropriate, 
• Increases transparency through 
enhanced market disclosures. 
• Increased market risk capital should 
lower the probability of catastrophic 
losses to the bank occurring because of 
market risk. 
• Modified requirements should 
reduce the procyclicality of market risk 
capital. 
We derive our estimates of the 
proposed rule’s effect on the market risk 
measure from the third trading book 
impact study conducted by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision in 
2009 and additional estimates of the 
capital requirement for standardized 
securitization exposures and correlation 
trading positions.28 Based on these two 
assessments, we estimate that the 
market risk measure will increase 300 
percent on average. The market risk 
measure itself acts as an estimate of the 
minimum regulatory capital 
requirement for an adequately 
capitalized bank. Thus, quadrupling the 
market risk measure suggests that 
minimum required capital will increase 
by approximately $50.7 billion under 
the proposed rule. These new capital 
requirements would lead banks to 
deleverage and lose the tax advantage of 
debt. We estimate that the loss of these 
tax benefits would be approximately 
$334 million per year. 
We estimate that new disclosure 
requirements and the implementation of 
calculations for the new market risk 
measures may involve some additional 
system costs, but because the proposed 
rule will only affect institutions already 
subject to the current market risk rule 
we expect these additional system costs 
to be de minimis. We do not anticipate 
that the proposed rule will create 
significant additional administrative 
costs for the OCC. Based on our 
assessment of the capital costs of the 
proposed rule; we estimate that the total 
cost of the proposed rule will be 
approximately $334 million in 2010 
dollars over one year. 
C. Comparison Between Proposed Rule 
and Baseline 
Under the baseline scenario, the 
current market risk rule would continue 
to apply. Thus, in the baseline scenario, 
required market risk capital would 
remain at current levels and there 
would be no additional cost associated 
with adding capital. However, the 
benefits of increased sensitivity to 
market risk, increased transparency, the 
improved targeting of trading positions, 
reduced procyclicality of market risk 
capital, and the protective advantages of 
additional capital would be lost under 
the baseline scenario. 
D. Comparison Between Proposed Rule 
and Alternatives 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (UMRA) requires a comparison 
between the proposed rule and 
reasonable alternatives. In this 
regulatory impact analysis, we compare 
the proposed rule with two alternatives 
that modify the size thresholds for the 
rule. 
Assessment of Alternative A 
Under Alternative A, we consider a 
rule that has the same provisions as the

1910 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
proposed rule, but we alter the rule’s 
trading book size threshold. Because 
trading assets and liabilities are 
concentrated in six or seven 
institutions, modest changes in the size 
thresholds have little impact on the 
dollar volume of trading assets affected 
by the market risk rule and thus little 
impact on the estimated cost of the rule. 
Changing the size threshold does affect 
the number of institutions affected by 
the rule, which suggests that the 
banking agencies’ systemic concerns 
could play a role in determining the 
appropriate size threshold for 
applicability of the market risk rule. 
Assessment of Alternative B 
Under Alternative B, we consider a 
rule that has the same provisions as the 
proposed rule, but we change the 
condition of the size thresholds from 
‘‘or’’ to ‘‘and’’. With this change, the 
proposed rule would apply to 
institutions that have $1 billion or more 
in trading assets and liabilities and a 
trading book to asset ratio of at least 10 
percent. Making the applicability of the 
market risk rule contingent on meeting 
both size thresholds would reduce the 
number of banks affected by the rule to 
four using the current thresholds of $1 
billion and 10 percent. In order for the 
alternative B rule to apply to the same 
number of institutions as the current 
rule, the alternative’s joint condition 
would have to be comparable to 
thresholds of between $500 million and 
$1 billion in the trading book and a 1 
percent trading-book-to-assets ratio. 
However, under this alternative the list 
of the 16 institutions subject to the rule 
would change slightly. Not surprisingly, 
as this joint threshold alternative could 
excuse some institutions with larger 
trading books, the estimated cost of the 
alternative rule does decrease with the 
number of institutions affected by the 
rule. 
E. Overall Impact of Proposed Rule, 
Baseline and Alternatives 
Under our baseline scenario, which 
reflects the current application of the 
market risk rule, a market risk capital 
charge of approximately $16.9 billion 
applies to 16 national banks. Under the 
proposed rule, this capital charge would 
continue to apply to the same 16 banks 
but the capital charge would likely 
quadruple. We estimate that the cost of 
this additional capital would be 
approximately $334 million per year in 
2010 dollars. 
Our alternatives examine the impact 
of a market risk rule that uses different 
size thresholds in order to determine 
which institutions are subject to the 
rule. With alternative A we consider 
altering the $1 billion trading book 
threshold used currently and 
maintained under the proposed rule. 
Although varying the size threshold 
changed the number of institutions 
affected by the rule, the overall capital 
cost of the rule did not significantly 
change. This reflects the high 
concentration of trading assets and 
liabilities in seven banks with over $15 
billion in their trading books as of 
September 30, 2010. As long as the 
proposed rule applies to these seven 
institutions, the additional required 
capital and its corresponding cost will 
not change considerably. 
Alternative B did affect both the 
number of institutions subject to the 
proposed rule and the cost of the 
proposed rule by limiting the market 
risk rule to institutions that meet both 
size criteria, i.e., a $1 billion trading 
book and a trading-book-to-assets ratio 
of at least 10 percent. Only four national 
banks currently meet both of these 
criteria, and applying the proposed rule 
to these institutions would require an 
additional $36.0 billion in market risk 
capital at a cost of approximately $237 
million. Clearly, the estimated cost of 
the proposed rule would fall if the size 
thresholds determining applicability of 
the market risk rule were to increase. 
However, the current size thresholds, 
which continue to apply under the 
proposed rule, capture those institutions 
that the regulatory agencies believe 
should be subject to market risk capital 
rules. The proposed rule changes 
covered positions, disclosure 
requirements, and methods relating to 
calculating the market risk measure. 
These changes achieve the important 
objectives of enhancing the banking 
system’s sensitivity to market risk, 
increases transparency of the trading 
book and market risk, and better 
captures trading positions for which 
market risk capital treatment is 
appropriate. The proposed rule carries 
over the current thresholds used to 
determine the applicability of the 
market risk rule. The banking agencies 
have determined that these size 
thresholds capture the appropriate 
institutions; those most exposed to 
market risk. 
The large increase in required market 
risk capital, which we estimate to be 
approximately $51 billion under the 
proposed rule, will provide a 
considerable buttress to the capital 
position of institutions subject to the 
market risk rule. This additional capital 
should dramatically lower the 
likelihood of catastrophic losses from 
market risk occurring at these 
institutions, which will enhance the 
safety and soundness of these 
institutions, the banking system, and 
world financial markets. Although there 
is some concern regarding the burden of 
the proposed increase in market risk 
capital and the effect this could have on 
bank lending, in the OCC’s opinion, the 
proposed rule offers a better balance 
between costs and benefits than either 
the baseline or the alternatives. 
The OCC does not expect the revised 
risk-based capital guidelines to have any 
disproportionate budgetary effect on any 
particular regions of the nation or 
particular State, local, or tribal 
governments, urban or rural or other 
types of communities, or particular 
segments of the private sector.

B. Proposed Information Collection 
Title of Information Collection: Risk- 
Based Capital Standards: Market Risk 
Frequency of Response: Varied—some 
requirements are done at least quarterly 
and some at least annually. 
Affected Public: 
OCC: National banks and Federal 
branches and agencies of foreign banks. 
Board: State member banks and bank 
holding companies. 
FDIC: Insured non-member banks, 
insured state branches of foreign banks, 
and certain subsidiaries of these 
entities. 
Abstract: The information collection 
requirements are found in sections 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the proposed 
rule. They will enhance risk sensitivity 
and introduce requirements for public 
disclosure of certain qualitative and 
quantitative information about a bank’s 
or bank holding companies’ market risk. 
The collection of information is 
necessary to ensure capital adequacy 
according to the level of market risk. 
Section-by-Section Analysis 
Section 3 sets forth the requirements 
for applying the market risk framework. 
Section 3(a)(1) requires clearly defined 
policies and procedures for determining 
which trading assets and trading 
liabilities are trading positions, which of 
its trading positions are correlation 
trading positions, and specifies what 
must be taken into account. Section 
3(a)(2) requires a clearly defined trading 
and hedging strategy for trading 
positions approved by senior 
management and specifies what each 
strategy must articulate. Section 3(b)(1) 
requires clearly defined policies and 
procedures for actively managing all 
covered positions and specifies the 
minimum that they must require. 
Sections 3(c)(4) through 3(c)(10) require 
the annual review of internal models 
and include certain requirements that 
the models must meet. Section 3(d)(4) 
requires an annual report to the board 
of directors on the effectiveness of 
controls supporting market risk 
measurement systems. 
Section 4(b) requires quarterly 
backtesting. Section 5(a)(5) requires 
institutions to demonstrate to the 
agencies the appropriateness of proxies 
used to capture risks within value-at- 
risk models. Section 5(c) requires 
institutions to retain value-at-risk and 
profit and loss information on 
subportfolios for two years. Section 
6(b)(3) requires policies and procedures 
for stressed value-at-risk models and 
prior approvals on determining periods 
of significant financial stress. 
Section 7(b)(1) specifies what internal 
models for specific risk must include 
and address. Section 8(a) requires prior 
written approval for incremental risk. 
Section 9(a) requires prior approval for 
comprehensive risk models. Section 
9(c)(2) requires retaining and making 
available the results of supervisory 
stress testing on a quarterly basis. 
Section 10(d) requires documentation 
quarterly for analysis of risk 
characteristics of each securitization 
position it holds. Section 11 requires 
quarterly quantitative disclosures, 
annual qualitative disclosures, and a 
formal disclosure policy approved by 
the board of directors that addresses the 
bank’s approach for determining the 
market risk disclosures it makes.

VI. Plain Language 
Section 722 of the GLBA required the 
agencies to use plain language in all 
proposed and final rules published after 
January 1, 2000. The agencies invite 
comment on how to make this proposed 
rule easier to understand. For example: 
• Have the agencies organized the 
material to suit your needs? If not, how 
could they present the rule more 
clearly? 
• Are the requirements in the rule 
clearly stated? If not, how could the rule 
be more clearly stated? 
• Do the regulations contain technical 
language or jargon that is not clear? If 
so, which language requires 
clarification? 
• Would a different format (grouping 
and order of sections, use of headings, 
paragraphing) make the regulation 
easier to understand? If so, what 
changes would achieve that? 
• Is this section format adequate? If 
not, which of the sections should be 
changed and how? 
• What other changes can the 
agencies incorporate to make the 
regulation easier to understand?

applies to any [banking organization] with 
aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities 
(as reported in the [banking organization]’s 
most recent quarterly [regulatory report]), 
equal to: 
(i) 10 percent or more of quarter-end total 
assets as reported on the most recent 
quarterly [Call Report or FR Y–9C]; or 
(ii) $1 billion or more. 
(2) The [Agency] may apply this appendix 
to any [banking organization] if the [Agency] 
deems it necessary or appropriate because of 
the level of market risk of the [banking 
organization] or to ensure safe and sound 
banking practices. 
(3) The [Agency] may exclude a [banking 
organization] that meets the criteria of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this appendix from 
application of this appendix if the [Agency] 
determines that the exclusion is appropriate 
based on the level of market risk of the 
[banking organization] and is consistent with 
safe and sound banking practices. 
(c) Reservation of authority—(1) The 
[Agency] may require a [banking 
organization] to hold an amount of capital 
greater than otherwise required under this 
appendix if the [Agency] determines that the 
[banking organization]’s capital requirement 
for market risk as calculated under this 
appendix is not commensurate with the 
market risk of the [banking organization]’s 
covered positions. In making determinations 
under this paragraph, the [Agency] will apply 
notice and response procedures generally in 
the same manner as the notice and response 
procedures described in [12 CFR 3.12, 12 
CFR 263.202, 12 CFR 325.6(c), 12 CFR 
567.3(d)]. 
(2) If the [Agency] determines that the risk- 
based capital requirement calculated under 
this appendix by the [banking organization] 
for one or more covered positions or 
portfolios of covered positions is not 
commensurate with the risks associated with 
those positions or portfolios, the [Agency] 
may require the [banking organization] to 
assign a different risk-based capital 
requirement to the positions or portfolios that 
more accurately reflects the risk of the 
positions or portfolios. 
(3) The [Agency] may also require a 
[banking organization] to calculate risk-based 
capital requirements for specific positions or 
portfolios under this appendix, or under [the 
advanced capital adequacy framework] or 
[the general risk-based capital rules], as 
appropriate, to more accurately reflect the 
risks of the positions. 
(4) Nothing in this appendix limits the 
authority of the [Agency] under any other 
provision of law or regulation to take 
supervisory or enforcement action, including 
action to address unsafe or unsound practices 
or conditions, deficient capital levels, or 
violations of law.

transaction in which the underlying 
exposures are owned by an investment firm 
that exercises substantially unfettered control 
over the size and composition of its assets, 
liabilities, and off-balance sheet exposures is 
not a securitization based on the transaction’s

Section 3. Requirements for Application of 
the Market Risk Capital Rule 
(a) Trading positions—(1) Identification of 
trading positions. A [banking organization] 
must have clearly defined policies and 
procedures for determining which of its 
trading assets and trading liabilities are 
trading positions and which of its trading 
positions are correlation trading positions. 
These policies and procedures must take into 
account: 
(i) The extent to which a position, or a 
hedge of its material risks, can be marked-to- 
market daily by reference to a two-way 
market; and 
(ii) Possible impairments to the liquidity of 
a position or its hedge. 
(2) Trading and hedging strategies. A 
[banking organization] must have clearly 
defined trading and hedging strategies for its 
trading positions that are approved by senior 
management of the [banking organization]. 
(i) The trading strategy must articulate the 
expected holding period of, and the market 
risk associated with, each portfolio of trading 
positions. 
(ii) The hedging strategy must articulate for 
each portfolio of trading positions the level 
of market risk the [banking organization] is 
willing to accept and must detail the 
instruments, techniques, and strategies the 
[banking organization] will use to hedge the 
risk of the portfolio. 
(b) Management of covered positions— 
(1) Active management. A [banking 
organization] must have clearly defined 
policies and procedures for actively 
managing all covered positions. At a 
minimum, these policies and procedures 
must require: 
(i) Marking positions to market or to model 
on a daily basis; 
(ii) Daily assessment of the [banking 
organization]’s ability to hedge position and 
portfolio risks, and of the extent of market 
liquidity; 
(iii) Establishment and daily monitoring of 
limits on positions by a risk control unit 
independent of the trading business unit; 
(iv) Daily monitoring by senior 
management of information described in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section; 
(v) At least annual reassessment of 
established limits on positions by senior 
management; and 
(vi) At least annual assessments by 
qualified personnel of the quality of market 
inputs to the valuation process, the 
soundness of key assumptions, the reliability 
of parameter estimation in pricing models, 
and the stability and accuracy of model 
calibration under alternative market 
scenarios. 
(2) Valuation of covered positions. The 
[banking organization] must have a process 
for prudent valuation of its covered positions 
that includes policies and procedures on the 
valuation of positions, marking positions to 
market or to model, independent price 
verification, and valuation adjustments or 
reserves. The valuation process must 
consider, as appropriate, unearned credit 
spreads, close-out costs, early termination 
costs, investing and funding costs, future 
administrative costs, liquidity, and model 
risk. 
(c) Requirements for internal models. (1) A 
[banking organization] must obtain the prior 
written approval of the [Agency] before using 
any internal model to calculate its risk-based 
capital requirement under this appendix. 
(2) A [banking organization] must meet all 
of the requirements of this section on an 
ongoing basis. The [banking organization] 
must promptly notify the [Agency] when: 
(i) The [banking organization] plans to 
extend the use of a model that the [Agency] 
has approved under this appendix to an 
additional business line or product type; 
(ii) The [banking organization] makes any 
change to any internal model approved by 
the [Agency] under this appendix that would 
result in a material change in the [banking 
organization]’s risk-weighted asset amount 
for a portfolio of covered positions; or 
(iii) The [banking organization] makes any 
material change to its modeling assumptions. 
(3) The [Agency] may rescind its approval 
of the use of any internal model (in whole 
or in part) or of the surcharge applicable to 
a [banking organization]’s modeled 
correlation trading positions as determined 
under section 9(d)(2) of this appendix, and 
determine an appropriate capital requirement 
for the covered positions to which the model 
would apply, if the [Agency] determines that 
the model no longer complies with this 
appendix or fails to reflect accurately the 
risks of the [banking organization]’s covered 
positions. 
(4) The [banking organization] must 
periodically, but no less frequently than 
annually, review its internal models in light 
of developments in financial markets and 
modeling technologies, and enhance those 
models as appropriate to ensure that they 
continue to meet the [Agency]’s standards for 
model approval and employ risk 
measurement methodologies that are most 
appropriate for the [banking organization]’s 
covered positions. 
(5) The [banking organization] must 
incorporate its internal models into its risk 
management process and integrate the 
internal models used for calculating its VaR- 
based measure into its daily risk management 
process.

1915 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
(6) The level of sophistication of a [banking 
organization]’s internal models must be 
commensurate with the complexity and 
amount of its covered positions. A [banking 
organization]’s internal models may use any 
of the generally accepted approaches, 
including but not limited to variance- 
covariance models, historical simulations, or 
Monte Carlo simulations, to measure market 
risk. 
(7) The [banking organization]’s internal 
models must properly measure all of the 
material risks in the covered positions to 
which they are applied. 
(8) The [banking organization]’s internal 
models must conservatively assess the risks 
arising from less liquid positions and 
positions with limited price transparency 
under realistic market scenarios. 
(9) The [banking organization] must have a 
rigorous and well-defined process for 
reestimating, reevaluating, and updating its 
internal models to ensure continued 
applicability and relevance. 
(10) If a [banking organization] uses 
internal models to measure specific risk, the 
internal models must also satisfy the 
requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of section 7 
of this appendix. 
(d) Control, oversight, and validation 
mechanisms. (1) The [banking organization] 
must have a risk control unit that reports 
directly to senior management and is 
independent from the business trading units. 
(2) The [banking organization] must 
validate its internal models initially and on 
an ongoing basis. The [banking 
organization]’s validation process must be 
independent of the internal models’ 
development, implementation, and 
operation, or the validation process must be 
subjected to an independent review of its 
adequacy and effectiveness. Validation must 
include: 
(i) An evaluation of the conceptual 
soundness of (including developmental 
evidence supporting) the internal models; 
(ii) An ongoing monitoring process that 
includes verification of processes and the 
comparison of the [banking organization]’s 
model outputs with relevant internal and 
external data sources or estimation 
techniques; and 
(iii) An outcomes analysis process that 
includes backtesting. For internal models 
used to calculate the VaR-based measure, this 
process must include a comparison of the 
changes in the [banking organization]’s 
portfolio value that would have occurred 
were end-of-day positions to remain 
unchanged (therefore, excluding fees, 
commissions, reserves, net interest income, 
and intraday trading) with VaR-based 
measures during a sample period not used in 
model development. 
(3) The [banking organization] must stress- 
test the market risk of its covered positions 
at a frequency appropriate to each portfolio, 
and in no case less frequently than quarterly. 
The stress tests must take into account 
concentration risk (including but not limited 
to concentrations in single issuers, 
industries, sectors, or markets), illiquidity 
under stressed market conditions, and risks 
arising from the [banking organization]’s 
trading activities that may not be adequately 
captured in its internal models. 
(4) The [banking organization] must have 
an internal audit function independent of 
business-line management that at least 
annually assesses the effectiveness of the 
controls supporting the [banking 
organization]’s market risk measurement 
systems, including the activities of the 
business trading units and independent risk 
control unit, compliance with policies and 
procedures, and calculation of the [banking 
organization]’s measure for market risk under 
this appendix. At least annually, the internal 
audit function must report its findings to the 
[banking organization]’s board of directors (or 
a committee thereof). 
(e) Internal assessment of capital 
adequacy. The [banking organization] must 
have a rigorous process for assessing its 
overall capital adequacy in relation to its 
market risk. The assessment must take into 
account risks that may not be captured fully 
in the VaR-based measure, including 
concentration and liquidity risk under 
stressed market conditions. 
(f) Documentation. The [banking 
organization] must adequately document all 
material aspects of its internal models, 
management and valuation of covered 
positions, control, oversight, validation and 
review processes and results, and internal 
assessment of capital adequacy. 
Section 4. Adjustments to the Risk-Based 
Capital Ratio Calculations 
(a) Risk-based capital ratio denominator. 
The [banking organization] must calculate its 
risk-based capital ratio denominator as 
follows: 
(1) Adjusted risk-weighted assets. The 
[banking organization] must calculate 
adjusted risk-weighted assets, which equal 
risk-weighted assets (as determined in 
accordance with [the advanced capital 
adequacy framework] or [the general risk- 
based capital rules], as applicable), with the 
following adjustments: 
(i) The [banking organization] must 
exclude the risk-weighted asset amounts of 
all covered positions (except foreign 
exchange positions that are not trading 
positions and over-the-counter derivative 
positions). 
(ii) A [banking organization] subject to [the 
general risk-based capital rules] may exclude 
receivables that arise from the posting of cash 
collateral and are associated with qualifying 
securities borrowing transactions to the 
extent the receivable is collateralized by the 
market value of the borrowed securities; 
(2) Measure for market risk. The [banking 
organization] must calculate the measure for 
market risk, which equals the sum of the 
VaR-based capital requirement, stressed VaR- 
based capital requirement, any specific risk 
add-ons, any incremental risk capital 
requirement, any comprehensive risk capital 
requirement, and any capital requirement for 
de minimis exposures as defined under this 
paragraph. 
(i) VaR-based capital requirement. The 
VaR-based capital requirement equals the 
greater of: 
(A) The previous day’s VaR-based measure 
as calculated under section 5 of this 
appendix; or 
(B) The average of the daily VaR-based 
measures as calculated under section 5 of 
this appendix for each of the preceding 60 
business days multiplied by three, except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(ii) Stressed VaR-based capital 
requirement. The stressed VaR-based capital 
requirement equals the greater of: 
(A) The most recent stressed VaR-based 
measure as calculated under section 6 of this 
appendix; or 
(B) The average of the stressed VaR-based 
measures as calculated under section 6 of 
this rule for each of the preceding 60 
business days multiplied by three, except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(iii) Any specific risk add-ons. Any specific 
risk add-ons that are required under section 
7 and are calculated in accordance with 
section 10 of this appendix. 
(iv) Any incremental risk capital 
requirement. Any incremental risk capital 
requirement as calculated under section 8 of 
this appendix. 
(v) Any comprehensive risk capital 
requirement. Any comprehensive risk capital 
requirement as calculated under section 9 of 
this appendix. 
(vi) Any capital requirement for de 
minimis exposures. The [banking 
organization] must add to its measure for 
market risk the absolute value of the market 
value of those de minimis exposures that are 
not captured in the [banking organization]’s 
VaR-based measure unless the [banking 
organization] has obtained prior written 
approval from the [Agency] to calculate a 
capital requirement for de minimis exposures 
using alternative techniques that 
appropriately measure the market risk 
associated with those exposures. 
(3) Market risk equivalent assets. The 
[banking organization] must calculate market 
risk equivalent assets as the measure for 
market risk (as calculated in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section) multiplied by 12.5. 
(4) Denominator calculation. The [banking 
organization] must add market risk 
equivalent assets (as calculated in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section) to adjusted risk- 
weighted assets (as calculated in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section). The resulting sum is 
the [banking organization]’s risk-based 
capital ratio denominator. 
(b) Backtesting. A [banking organization] 
must compare each of its most recent 250 
business days’ trading losses (excluding fees, 
commissions, reserves, intra-day trading, and 
net interest income) with the corresponding 
daily VaR-based measures calibrated to a 
one-day holding period and at a one-tail, 99.0 
percent confidence level. 
(1) Once each quarter, the [banking 
organization] must identify the number of 
exceptions (that is, the number of business 
days for which the actual daily net trading 
loss, if any, exceeds the corresponding daily 
VaR-based measure) that have occurred over 
the preceding 250 business days. 
(2) A [banking organization] must use the 
multiplication factor in Table 1 of this 
appendix that corresponds to the number of 
exceptions identified in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section to determine its VaR-based 
capital requirement for market risk under 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and to 
determine its stressed VaR-based capital 
requirement for market risk under paragraph

Section 5. VaR-Based Measure 
(a) General requirement. A [banking 
organization] must use one or more internal 
models to calculate daily a VaR-based 
measure of the general market risk of all 
covered positions. The daily VaR-based 
measure also may reflect the [banking 
organization]’s specific risk for one or more 
portfolios of debt and equity positions, if the 
internal models meet the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) of section 7. The daily VaR- 
based measure must also reflect the [banking 
organization]’s specific risk for any portfolio 
of correlation trading positions that is 
modeled under section 9 of this appendix. A 
[banking organization] may elect to include 
term repo-style transactions in its VaR-based 
measure, provided that the [banking 
organization] includes all such term repo- 
style transactions consistently over time. 
(1) The [banking organization]’s internal 
models for calculating its VaR-based measure 
must use risk factors sufficient to measure 
the market risk inherent in all covered 
positions. The market risk categories must 
include, as appropriate, interest rate risk, 
credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign 
exchange risk, and commodity price risk. For 
material positions in the major currencies 
and markets, modeling techniques must 
incorporate enough segments of the yield 
curve—in no case less than six—to capture 
differences in volatility and less than perfect 
correlation of rates along the yield curve. 
(2) The VaR-based measure may 
incorporate empirical correlations within and 
across risk categories, provided the [banking 
organization] validates and demonstrates the 
reasonableness of its process for measuring 
correlations. If the VaR-based measure does 
not incorporate empirical correlations across 
risk categories, the [banking organization] 
must add the separate measures from its 
internal models used to calculate the VaR- 
based measure for the appropriate market 
risk categories (interest rate risk, credit 
spread risk, equity price risk, foreign 
exchange rate risk, and/or commodity price 
risk) to determine its aggregate VaR-based 
measure. 
(3) The VaR-based measure must include 
the risks arising from the nonlinear price 
characteristics of options positions or 
positions with embedded optionality and the 
sensitivity of the market value of the 
positions to changes in the volatility of the 
underlying rates, prices, or other material 
risk factors. A [banking organization] with a 
large or complex options portfolio must 
measure the volatility of options positions or 
positions with embedded optionality by 
different maturities and/or strike prices, 
where material. 
(4) The [banking organization] must be able 
to justify to the satisfaction of the [Agency] 
the omission of any risk factors from the 
calculation of its VaR-based measure that the 
[banking organization] uses in its pricing 
models. 
(5) The [banking organization] must 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
[Agency] the appropriateness of any proxies 
used to capture the risks of the [banking 
organization]’s actual positions for which 
such proxies are used. 
(b) Quantitative requirements for VaR- 
based measure. (1) The VaR-based measure 
must be calculated on a daily basis using a 
one-tail, 99.0 percent confidence level, and a 
holding period equivalent to a 10-business- 
day movement in underlying risk factors, 
such as rates, spreads, and prices. To 
calculate VaR-based measures using a 10- 
business-day holding period, the [banking 
organization] may calculate 10-business-day 
measures directly or may convert VaR-based 
measures using holding periods other than 10 
business days to the equivalent of a 10- 
business-day holding period. A [banking 
organization] that converts its VaR-based 
measure in such a manner must be able to 
justify the reasonableness of its approach to 
the satisfaction of the [Agency]. 
(2) The VaR-based measure must be based 
on a historical observation period of at least 
one year. Data used to determine the VaR- 
based measure must be relevant to the 
[banking organization]’s actual exposures and 
of sufficient quality to support the 
calculation of risk-based capital 
requirements. The [banking organization] 
must update data sets at least monthly or 
more frequently as changes in market 
conditions or portfolio composition warrant. 
For a [banking organization] that uses a 
weighting scheme or other method for the 
historical observation period, the [banking 
organization] must either: 
(i) Use an effective observation period of at 
least one year in which the average time lag 
of the observations is at least six months; or 
(ii) Demonstrate to the [Agency] that its 
weighting scheme is more effective than a 
weighting scheme with an average time lag 
of at least six months at representing the 
volatility of the [banking organization]’s 
trading portfolio over a full business cycle. A 
[banking organization] using this option must 
update its data more frequently than monthly 
and in a manner appropriate for the type of 
weighting scheme. 
(c) A [banking organization] must divide its 
portfolio into a number of significant 
subportfolios approved by the [Agency] for 
subportfolio backtesting purposes. These 
subportfolios must be sufficient to allow the 
[banking organization] and the [Agency] to 
assess the adequacy of the VaR model at the 
risk factor level; the [Agency] will evaluate 
the appropriateness of these subportfolios 
relative to the value and composition of the 
[banking organization]’s covered positions. 
The [banking organization] must retain and 
make available to the [Agency] the following 
information for each subportfolio for each 
business day over the previous two years 
(500 business days), with no more than a 60 
day lag: 
(1) A daily VaR-based measure for the 
subportfolio calibrated to a one-tail, 99.0 
percent confidence level; 
(2) The daily profit or loss for the 
subportfolio (that is, the net change in price 
of the positions held in the portfolio at the 
end of the previous business day); and 
(3) The p-value of the profit or loss on each 
day (that is, the probability of observing a 
profit that is less than, or a loss that is greater 
than, the amount reported for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section based on the 
model used to calculate the VaR-based 
measure described in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section). 
Section 6. Stressed VaR-Based Measure 
(a) General requirement. At least weekly, a 
[banking organization] must use the same 
internal model(s) used to calculate its VaR- 
based measure to calculate a stressed VaR- 
based measure. 
(b) Quantitative requirements for stressed 
VaR-based measure. (1) A [banking 
organization] must calculate a stressed VaR- 
based measure for its covered positions using 
the same model(s) used to calculate the VaR- 
based measure, subject to the same 
confidence level and holding period 
applicable to the VaR-based measure under 
section 5, but with model inputs calibrated 
to historical data from a continuous 12- 
month period that reflects a period of 
significant financial stress appropriate to the 
[banking organization]’s current portfolio. 
(2) The stressed VaR-based measure must 
be calculated at least weekly and be no less 
than the [banking organization]’s VaR-based 
measure. 
(3) A [banking organization] must have 
policies and procedures that describe how it 
determines the period of significant financial 
stress used to calculate the [banking 
organization]’s stressed VaR-based measure 
under this section and must be able to 
provide empirical support for the period 
used. The [banking organization] must obtain 
the prior approval of the [Agency] for, and 
notify the [Agency] if the [banking 
organization] makes any material changes to, 
these policies and procedures. The policies 
and procedures must address: 
(i) How the [banking organization] links 
the period of significant financial stress used 
to calculate the stressed VaR-based measure 
to the composition and directional bias of its 
current portfolio; and 
(ii) The [banking organization]’s process for 
selecting, reviewing, and updating the period 
of significant financial stress used to 
calculate the stressed VaR-based measure and 
for monitoring the appropriateness of the 
period to the [banking organization]’s current 
portfolio. 
(4) Nothing in this section prevents the 
[Agency] from requiring a [banking 
organization] to use a different period of 
significant financial stress in the calculation 
of the stressed VaR-based measure.

1917 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
Section 7. Specific Risk 
(a) General requirement. A [banking 
organization] must use one of the methods in 
this section to measure the specific risk for 
each of its debt, equity, and securitization 
positions with specific risk. 
(b) Modeled specific risk. A [banking 
organization] may use models to measure the 
specific risk of covered positions as provided 
in paragraph (a) of section 5 (therefore, 
excluding securitization positions that are 
not modeled under section 9 of this 
appendix). A [banking organization] must use 
models to measure the specific risk of 
correlation trading positions that are 
modeled under section 9 of this appendix. 
(1) Requirements for specific risk modeling. 
(i) If a [banking organization] uses internal 
models to measure the specific risk of a 
portfolio, the internal models must: 
(A) Explain the historical price variation in 
the portfolio; 
(B) Be responsive to changes in market 
conditions; 
(C) Be robust to an adverse environment, 
including signaling rising risk in an adverse 
environment; and 
(D) Capture all material components of 
specific risk for the debt and equity positions 
in the portfolio. Specifically, the internal 
models must: 
(1) Capture event risk and idiosyncratic 
risk; 
(2) Capture and demonstrate sensitivity to 
material differences between positions that 
are similar but not identical; and 
(3) Capture and demonstrate sensitivity to 
changes in portfolio composition and 
concentrations. 
(ii) If a [banking organization] calculates an 
incremental risk measure for a portfolio of 
debt or equity positions under section 8 of 
this appendix, the [banking organization] is 
not required to capture default and credit 
migration risks in its internal models used to 
measure the specific risk of those portfolios. 
(2) Specific risk fully modeled for one or 
more portfolios. If the [banking 
organization]’s VaR-based measure captures 
all material aspects of specific risk for one or 
more of its portfolios of debt, equity, or 
correlation trading positions, the [banking 
organization] has no specific risk add-on for 
those portfolios for purposes of paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of section 4 of this appendix. 
(c) Specific risk not modeled. (1) If the 
[banking organization]’s VaR-based measure 
does not capture all material aspects of 
specific risk for a portfolio of debt, equity, or 
correlation trading positions, the [banking 
organization] must calculate a specific-risk 
add-on for the portfolio under the 
standardized measurement method as 
described in section 10 of this appendix. 
(2) A [banking organization] must calculate 
a specific risk add-on under the standardized 
measurement method as described in section 
10 of this appendixfor all of its securitization 
positions that are not modeled under section 
9 of this appendix. 
Section 8. Incremental Risk 
(a) General requirement. A [banking 
organization] that measures the specific risk 
of a portfolio of debt positions under section 
7(b) using internal models must calculate at 
least weekly an incremental risk measure for 
that portfolio according to the requirements 
in this section. The incremental risk measure 
is the [banking organization]’s measure of 
potential losses due to incremental risk over 
a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 
percent confidence level, either under the 
assumption of a constant level of risk, or 
under the assumption of constant positions. 
With the prior approval of the [Agency], a 
[banking organization] may choose to include 
portfolios of equity positions in its 
incremental risk model, provided that it 
consistently includes such equity positions 
in a manner that is consistent with how the 
[banking organization] internally measures 
and manages the incremental risk of such 
positions at the portfolio level. If equity 
positions are included in the model, for 
modeling purposes default is considered to 
have occurred upon the default of any debt 
of the issuer of the equity position. A 
[banking organization] may not include 
correlation trading positions or securitization 
positions in its incremental risk measure. 
(b) Requirements for incremental risk 
modeling. For purposes of calculating the 
incremental risk measure, the incremental 
risk model must: 
(1) Measure incremental risk over a one- 
year time horizon and at a one-tail, 99.9 
percent confidence level, either under the 
assumption of a constant level of risk, or 
under the assumption of constant positions. 
(i) A constant level of risk assumption 
means that the [banking organization] 
rebalances, or rolls over, its trading positions 
at the beginning of each liquidity horizon 
over the one-year horizon in a manner that 
maintains the [banking organization]’s initial 
risk level. The [banking organization] must 
determine the frequency of rebalancing in a 
manner consistent with the liquidity 
horizons of the positions in the portfolio. The 
liquidity horizon of a position or set of 
positions is the time required for a [banking 
organization] to reduce its exposure to, or 
hedge all of its material risks of, the 
position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity 
horizon for a position or set of positions may 
not be less than the lower of three months 
or the contractual maturity of the position. 
(ii) A constant position assumption means 
that the [banking organization] maintains the 
same set of positions throughout the one-year 
horizon. If a [banking organization] uses this 
assumption, it must do so consistently across 
all portfolios. 
(iii) A [banking organization]’s selection of 
a constant position or a constant risk 
assumption must be consistent between the 
[banking organization]’s incremental risk 
model and its comprehensive risk model 
described in section 9, if applicable. 
(iv) A [banking organization]’s treatment of 
liquidity horizons must be consistent 
between the [banking organization]’s 
incremental risk model and its 
comprehensive risk model described in 
section 9, if applicable. 
(2) Recognize the impact of correlations 
between default and migration events among 
obligors. 
(3) Reflect the effect of issuer and market 
concentrations, as well as concentrations that 
can arise within and across product classes 
during stressed conditions. 
(4) Reflect netting only of long and short 
positions that reference the same financial 
instrument. 
(5) Reflect any material mismatch between 
a position and its hedge. 
(6) Recognize the effect that liquidity 
horizons have on dynamic hedging strategies. 
In such cases, a [banking organization] must: 
(i) Choose to model the rebalancing of the 
hedge consistently over the relevant set of 
trading positions; 
(ii) Demonstrate that the inclusion of 
rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk 
measurement; 
(iii) Demonstrate that the market for the 
hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit 
rebalancing during periods of stress; and 
(iv) Capture in the incremental risk model 
any residual risks arising from such hedging 
strategies. 
(7) Reflect the nonlinear impact of options 
and other positions with material nonlinear 
behavior with respect to default and 
migration changes. 
(8) Maintain consistency with the [banking 
organization]’s internal risk management 
methodologies for identifying, measuring, 
and managing risk. 
(c) Calculation of incremental risk capital 
requirement. The incremental risk capital 
requirement is the greater of: 
(1) The average of the incremental risk 
measures over the previous 12 weeks; or 
(2) The most recent incremental risk 
measure. 
Section 9. Comprehensive Risk 
(a) General requirement. (1) Subject to the 
prior approval of the [Agency], a [banking 
organization] may use the method in this 
section to measure comprehensive risk, that 
is, all price risk, for one or more portfolios 
of correlation trading positions. 
(2) A [banking organization] that measures 
the price risk of a portfolio of correlation 
trading positions using internal models must 
calculate at least weekly a comprehensive 
risk measure that captures all price risk 
according to the requirements of this section. 
The comprehensive risk measure is either: 
(i) The sum of: 
(A) The [banking organization]’s modeled 
measure of all price risk determined 
according to the requirements in paragraph 
(b) of this section; and 
(B) A surcharge for the [banking 
organization]’s modeled correlation trading 
positions equal to the total specific risk add- 
on for such positions as calculated under 
section 10 of this appendix multiplied by 
15.0 percent; or 
(ii) With approval of the [Agency] and 
provided the [banking organization] has met 
the requirements of this section for a period 
of at least one year and can demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the model through the results 
of ongoing model validation efforts including 
robust benchmarking, the greater of: 
(A) The [banking organization]’s modeled 
measure of all price risk determined 
according to the requirements in paragraph 
(b) of this section; or 
(B) The total specific risk add-on that 
would apply to the bank’s modeled 
correlation trading positions as calculated 
under section 10 of this appendix multiplied 
by 8.0 percent.

1918 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
(b) Requirements for modeling all price 
risk. If a [banking organization] uses an 
internal model to measure the price risk of 
a portfolio of correlation trading positions: 
(1) The internal model must measure 
comprehensive risk over a one-year time 
horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence 
level, either under the assumption of a 
constant level of risk, or under the 
assumption of constant positions. 
(2) The model must capture all material 
price risk, including but not limited to the 
following: 
(i) The risks associated with the 
contractual structure of cash flows of the 
position, its issuer, and its underlying 
exposures; 
(ii) Credit spread risk, including nonlinear 
price risks; 
(iii) The volatility of implied correlations, 
including nonlinear price risks such as the 
cross-effect between spreads and 
correlations; 
(iv) Basis risk; 
(v) Recovery rate volatility as it relates to 
the propensity for recovery rates to affect 
tranche prices; and 
(vi) To the extent the comprehensive risk 
measure incorporates the benefits of dynamic 
hedging, the static nature of the hedge over 
the liquidity horizon must be recognized. In 
such cases, a [banking organization] must: 
(A) Choose to model the rebalancing of the 
hedge consistently over the relevant set of 
trading positions; 
(B) Demonstrate that the inclusion of 
rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk 
measurement; 
(C) Demonstrate that the market for the 
hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit 
rebalancing during periods of stress; and 
(D) Capture in the comprehensive risk 
model any residual risks arising from such 
hedging strategies; 
(3) The [banking organization] must use 
market data that are relevant in representing 
the risk profile of the [banking organization]’s 
correlation trading positions in order to 
ensure that the [banking organization] fully 
captures the material risks of the correlation 
trading positions in its comprehensive risk 
measure in accordance with this section; and 
(4) The [banking organization] must be able 
to demonstrate that its model is an 
appropriate representation of comprehensive 
risk in light of the historical price variation 
of its correlation trading positions. 
(c) Requirements for stress testing. 
(1) A [banking organization] must at least 
weekly apply specific, supervisory stress 
scenarios to its portfolio of correlation 
trading positions that capture changes in: 
(i) Default rates; 
(ii) Recovery rates; 
(iii) Credit spreads; 
(iv) Correlations of underlying exposures; 
and 
(v) Correlations of a correlation trading 
position and its hedge. 
(2) Other requirements. (i) A [banking 
organization] must retain and make available 
to the [Agency] the results of the supervisory 
stress testing, including comparisons with 
the capital requirements generated by the 
[banking organization]’s comprehensive risk 
model. 
(ii) A [banking organization] must report to 
the [Agency] promptly any instances where 
the stress tests indicate any material 
deficiencies in the comprehensive risk 
model. 
(d) Calculation of comprehensive risk 
capital requirement. The comprehensive risk 
capital requirement is the greater of: 
(1) The average of the comprehensive risk 
measures over the previous 12 weeks; or 
(2) The most recent comprehensive risk 
measure. 
Section 10. Standardized Measurement 
Method for Specific Risk 
(a) General requirement. A [banking 
organization] must calculate a total specific 
risk add-on for each portfolio of debt and 
equity positions for which the [banking 
organization]’s VaR-based measure does not 
capture all material aspects of specific risk 
and for all securitization positions that are 
not modeled under section 9 of this 
appendix. A [banking organization] must 
calculate each specific risk add-on in 
accordance with the requirements of this 
section. 
(1) The specific risk add-on for an 
individual debt or securitization position that 
represents purchased credit protection is 
capped at the market value of the protection. 
(2) For debt, equity, or securitization 
positions that are derivatives with linear 
payoffs, a [banking organization] must risk 
weight the market value of the effective 
notional amount of the underlying 
instrument or index portfolio. A swap must 
be included as an effective notional position 
in the underlying instrument or portfolio, 
with the receiving side treated as a long 
position and the paying side treated as a 
short position. For debt, equity, or 
securitization positions that are derivatives 
with nonlinear payoffs, a [banking 
organization] must risk weight the market 
value of the effective notional amount of the 
underlying instrument or portfolio 
multiplied by the derivative’s delta. 
(3) For debt, equity, or securitization 
positions, a [banking organization] may net 
long and short positions (including 
derivatives) in identical issues or identical 
indices. A [banking organization] may also 
net positions in depositary receipts against 
an opposite position in an identical equity in 
different markets, provided that the [banking 
organization] includes the costs of 
conversion. 
(4) A set of transactions consisting of either 
a debt position and its credit derivative 
hedge or a securitization position and its 
credit derivative hedge has a specific risk 
add-on of zero if the debt or securitization 
position is fully hedged by a total return 
swap (or similar instrument where there is a 
matching of payments and changes in market 
value of the position) and there is an exact 
match between the reference obligation of the 
swap and the debt or securitization position, 
the maturity of the swap and the debt or 
securitization position, and the currency of 
the swap and the debt or securitization 
position. 
(5) The specific risk add-on for a set of 
transactions consisting of either a debt 
position and its credit derivative hedge or a 
securitization position and its credit 
derivative hedge that does not meet the 
criteria of paragraph (a)(4) of this section is 
equal to 20.0 percent of the capital 
requirement for the side of the transaction 
with the higher capital requirement when the 
credit risk of the position is fully hedged by 
a credit default swap or similar instrument 
and there is an exact match between the 
reference obligation of the credit derivative 
hedge and the debt or securitization position, 
the maturity of the credit derivative hedge 
and the debt or securitization position, and 
the currency of the credit derivative hedge 
and the debt or securitization position. 
(6) The specific risk add-on for a set of 
transactions consisting of either a debt 
position and its credit derivative hedge or a 
securitization position and its credit 
derivative hedge that does not meet the 
criteria of either paragraph (a)(4) or (a)(5) of 
this section, but in which all or substantially 
all of the price risk has been hedged, is equal 
to the specific risk add-on for the side of the 
transaction with the higher specific risk add- 
on. 
(b) Debt and securitization positions. (1) 
Unless otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the total specific risk 
add-on for a portfolio of debt or 
securitization positions is the sum of the 
specific risk add-ons for individual debt or 
securitization positions, as computed under 
this section. To determine the specific risk 
add-on for individual debt or securitization 
positions, a [banking organization] must 
multiply the absolute value of the current 
market value of each net long or net short 
debt or securitization position in the 
portfolio by the appropriate risk-weighting 
factor in Table 2. The following definitions 
apply to this paragraph, including Table 2:

1919 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 7 / Tuesday, January 11, 2011 / Proposed Rules 
4 Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD)-based countries is defined in 
[the general risk-based capital rules]. 
5 U.S. government-sponsored agencies, 
multilateral development banks, and OECD banks 
are defined in [the general risk-based capital rules]. 
6 A portfolio is well-diversified if it contains a 
large number of individual equity positions, with 
no single position representing a substantial portion 
of the portfolio’s total market value. 
TABLE 2—SPECIFIC RISK WEIGHTING FACTORS FOR DEBT AND SECURITIZATION POSITIONS—Continued 
Category Remaining maturity (contractual) 
Risk-weighting 
factor 
(in percent) 
Other ......................................................... N/A ............................................................................................................................... 8.00 
(i) The government category includes all 
debt instruments of central governments of 
OECD-based countries 4 including bonds, 
Treasury bills, and other short-term 
instruments, as well as local currency 
instruments of non-OECD central 
governments to the extent the bank has 
liabilities booked in that currency. 
(ii) The qualifying category includes debt 
instruments of U.S. government-sponsored 
agencies, general obligation debt instruments 
issued by states and other political 
subdivisions of OECD-based countries, 
multilateral development banks, and debt 
instruments issued by U.S. depository 
institutions or OECD-banks that do not 
qualify as capital of the issuing institution.5 
This category also includes other debt 
instruments, including corporate debt and 
revenue instruments issued by states and 
other political subdivisions of OECD 
countries, that are: 
(A) Rated investment-grade by at least two 
nationally recognized credit rating services; 
(B) Rated investment-grade by one 
nationally recognized credit rating agency 
and not rated less than investment-grade by 
any other credit rating agency; or 
(C) Unrated, but deemed to be of 
comparable investment quality by the 
reporting bank and the issuer has 
instruments listed on a recognized stock 
exchange, subject to review by the [Agency]. 
(iii) The other category includes debt 
instruments that are not included in the 
government or qualifying categories. 
(2) Nth-to-default credit derivatives. The 
total specific risk add-on for a portfolio of nth- 
to-default credit derivatives is the sum of the 
specific risk add-ons for individual nth-to- 
default credit derivatives, as computed under 
this paragraph. The specific risk add-on for 
each nth-to-default credit derivative position 
applies irrespective of whether a [banking 
organization] is a net protection buyer or net 
protection seller. A [banking organization] 
must calculate the specific risk add-on for 
each nth-to-default credit derivative as 
follows: 
(i) First-to-default credit derivatives. 
(A) The specific risk add-on for a first-to- 
default credit derivative is the lesser of: 
(1) The sum of the specific risk add-ons for 
the individual reference credit exposures in 
the group of reference exposures; or 
(2) The maximum possible credit event 
payment under the credit derivative contract. 
(B) Where a [banking organization] has a 
risk position in one of the reference credit 
exposures underlying a first-to-default credit 
derivative and this credit derivative hedges 
the [banking organization]’s risk position, the 
[banking organization] is allowed to reduce 
both the specific risk add-on for the reference 
credit exposure and that part of the specific 
risk add-on for the credit derivative that 
relates to this particular reference credit 
exposure such that its specific risk add-on for 
the pair reflects the bank’s net position in the 
reference credit exposure. Where a [banking 
organization] has multiple risk positions in 
reference credit exposures underlying a first- 
to-default credit derivative, this offset is 
allowed only for the underlying reference 
credit exposure having the lowest specific 
risk add-on. 
(ii) Second-or-subsequent-to-default credit 
derivatives. 
(A) The specific risk add-on for a second- 
or-subsequent-to-default credit derivative is 
the lesser of: 
(1) The sum of the specific risk add-ons for 
the individual reference credit exposures in 
the group of reference exposures, but 
disregarding the (n–1) obligations with the 
lowest specific risk add-ons; or 
(2) The maximum possible credit event 
payment under the credit derivative contract. 
(B) For second-or-subsequent-to-default 
credit derivatives, no offset of the specific 
risk add-on with an underlying reference 
credit exposure is allowed. 
(c) Equity positions. The total specific risk 
add-on for a portfolio of equity positions is 
the sum of the specific risk add-ons of the 
individual equity positions, as computed 
under this section. To determine the specific 
risk add-on of individual equity positions, a 
[banking organization] must multiply the 
absolute value of the current market value of 
each net long or net short equity position by 
the appropriate risk-weighting factor as 
determined under this paragraph. 
(1) The [banking organization] must 
multiply the absolute value of the current 
market value of each net long or net short 
equity position by a risk-weighting factor of 
8.0 percent. For equity positions that are 
index contracts comprising a well-diversified 
portfolio of equity instruments, the absolute 
value of the current market value of each net 
long or net short position is multiplied by a 
risk-weighting factor of 2.0 percent.6 
(2) For equity positions arising from the 
following futures-related arbitrage strategies, 
a [banking organization] may apply a 2.0 
percent risk-weighting factor to one side 
(long or short) of each position with the 
opposite side exempt from an additional 
capital requirement: 
(i) Long and short positions in exactly the 
same index at different dates or in different 
market centers; or 
(ii) Long and short positions in index 
contracts at the same date in different, but 
similar indices. 
(3) For futures contracts on main indices 
that are matched by offsetting positions in a 
basket of stocks comprising the index, a 
[banking organization] may apply a 2.0 
percent risk-weighting factor to the futures 
and stock basket positions (long and short), 
provided that such trades are deliberately 
entered into and separately controlled, and 
that the basket of stocks is comprised of 
stocks representing at least 90.0 percent of 
the capitalization of the index. A main index 
refers to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, the 
FTSE All-World Index, and any other index 
for which the [banking organization] can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
[AGENCY] that the equities represented in 
the index have liquidity, depth of market, 
and size of bid-ask spreads comparable to 
equities in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 
and FTSE All-World Index. 
(d)(1) A [banking organization] must be 
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
[Agency] a comprehensive understanding of 
the features of a securitization position that 
would materially affect the performance of 
the position. The [banking organization]’s 
analysis must be commensurate with the 
complexity of the securitization position and 
the materiality of the position in relation to 
capital. 
(2) To support the demonstration of its 
comprehensive understanding, for each 
securitization position a [banking 
organization] must: 
(i) Conduct and document an analysis of 
the risk characteristics of a securitization 
position prior to acquiring the position, 
considering: 
(A) Structural features of the securitization 
that would materially impact the 
performance of the position, for example, the 
contractual cash flow waterfall, waterfall- 
related triggers, credit enhancements, 
liquidity enhancements, market value 
triggers, the performance of organizations 
that service the position, and deal-specific 
definitions of default; 
(B) Relevant information regarding the 
performance of the underlying credit 
exposure(s), for example, the percentage of 
loans 30, 60, and 90 days past due; default 
rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; 
property types; occupancy; average credit 
score or other measures of creditworthiness; 
average LTV ratio; and industry and 
geographic diversification data on the 
underlying exposure(s); 
(C) Relevant market data of the 
securitization, for example, bid-ask spreads, 
most recent sales price and historical price 
volatility, trading volume, implied market

rating, and size, depth and concentration 
level of the market for the securitization; and 
(D) For resecuritization positions, 
performance information on the underlying 
securitization exposures, for example, the 
issuer name and credit quality, and the 
characteristics and performance of the 
exposures underlying the securitization 
exposures; and 
(ii) On an on-going basis (no less frequently 
than quarterly), evaluate, review, and update 
as appropriate the analysis required under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each 
securitization position. 
Section 11. Market Risk Disclosures 
(a) Scope. A [banking organization] must 
comply with this section unless it is a 
consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding 
company or a depository institution that is 
subject to these requirements or of a non-U.S. 
banking organization that is subject to 
comparable public disclosure requirements 
in its home jurisdiction. Quantitative 
disclosures must be made publicly each 
calendar quarter. If a significant change 
occurs, such that the most recent reporting 
amounts are no longer reflective of the 
[banking organization]’s capital adequacy 
and risk profile, then a brief discussion of 
this change and its likely impact must be 
provided as soon as practicable thereafter. 
Qualitative disclosures that typically do not 
change each quarter may be disclosed 
annually, provided any significant changes 
are disclosed in the interim. If a [banking 
organization] believes that disclosure of 
specific commercial or financial information 
would prejudice seriously its position by 
making public certain information that is 
either proprietary or confidential in nature, 
the [banking organization] need not disclose 
these specific items, but must disclose more 
general information about the subject matter 
of the requirement, together with the fact 
that, and the reason why, the specific items 
of information have not been disclosed. 
(b) Disclosure policy. The [banking 
organization] must have a formal disclosure 
policy approved by the board of directors 
that addresses the [banking organization]’s 
approach for determining the market risk 
disclosures it makes. The policy must 
address the associated internal controls and 
disclosure controls and procedures. The 
board of directors and senior management 
must ensure that appropriate verification of 
the disclosures takes place and that effective 
internal controls and disclosure controls and 
procedures are maintained. One or more 
senior officers of the [banking organization] 
must attest that the disclosures meet the 
requirements of this appendix, and the board 
of directors and senior management are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining 
an effective internal control structure over 
financial reporting, including the disclosures 
required by this section. 
(c) Quantitative disclosures. 
(1) For each portfolio of covered positions, 
the [banking organization] must publicly 
disclose the following information at least 
quarterly: 
(i) The high, low, median, and mean VaR- 
based measures over the reporting period and 
the VaR-based measure at period-end; 
(ii) The high, low, median, and mean 
stressed VaR-based measures over the 
reporting period and the stressed VaR-based 
measure at period-end; 
(iii) The high, low, median, and mean 
incremental risk capital requirements over 
the reporting period and the incremental risk 
capital requirement at period-end; 
(iv) The high, low, median, and mean 
comprehensive risk capital requirements over 
the reporting period and the comprehensive 
risk capital requirement at period-end, with 
the period-end requirement broken down 
into appropriate risk classifications (for 
example, default risk, migration risk, 
correlation risk); 
(v) Separate measures for interest rate risk, 
credit spread risk, equity price risk, foreign 
exchange risk, and commodity price risk 
used to calculate the VaR-based measure; and 
(vi) A comparison of VaR-based estimates 
with actual gains or losses experienced by 
the [banking organization], with an analysis 
of important outliers. 
(2) In addition, the [banking organization] 
must publicly disclose the following 
information at least quarterly: 
(i) The aggregate amount of on-balance 
sheet and off-balance sheet securitization 
positions by exposure type; and 
(ii) The aggregate amount of correlation 
trading positions. 
(d) Qualitative disclosures. 
(1) For each portfolio of covered positions, 
the [banking organization] must publicly 
disclose the following information at least 
annually, or more frequently in the event of 
material changes for each portfolio: 
(i) The composition of material portfolios 
of covered positions; 
(ii) The [banking organization]’s valuation 
policies, procedures, and methodologies for 
covered positions including, for 
securitization positions, the methods and key 
assumptions used for valuing such positions, 
any significant changes since the last 
reporting period, and the impact of such 
change; 
(iii) The characteristics of the internal 
models used for purposes of this appendix. 
For the incremental risk capital requirement 
and the comprehensive risk capital 
requirement, this must include: 
(A) The approach used by the [banking 
organization] to determine liquidity horizons; 
(B) The methodologies used to achieve a 
capital assessment that is consistent with the 
required soundness standard; and 
(C) The specific approaches used in the 
validation of these models; 
(iv) A description of the approaches used 
for validating and evaluating the accuracy of 
internal models and modeling processes for 
purposes of this appendix; 
(v) For each market risk category (that is, 
interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity 
price risk, foreign exchange risk, and 
commodity price risk), a description of the 
stress tests applied to the positions subject to 
the factor; 
(vi) The results of the comparison of the 
[banking organization]’s internal estimates 
for purposes of this appendix with actual 
outcomes during a sample period not used in 
model development; 
(vii) The soundness standard on which the 
[banking organization]’s internal capital 
adequacy assessment under this appendix is 
based, including a description of the 
methodologies used to achieve a capital 
adequacy assessment that is consistent with 
the soundness standard; 
(2) A description of the [banking 
organization]’s processes for monitoring 
changes in the credit and market risk of 
securitization positions, including how those 
processes differ for resecuritization positions; 
and 
(3) A description of the [banking 
organization]’s policy governing the use of 
credit risk mitigation to mitigate the risks of 
securitization and resecuritization positions.
