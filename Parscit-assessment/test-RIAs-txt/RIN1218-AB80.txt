SECTION ONE
1. INTRODUCTION
OSHA’s Subpart D covers General Industry safety requirements for walking and working 
surfaces, including ladders, stairways, platforms, floors, and ramps. The regulation was first 
promulgated in 1971 and was based on a number of American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) voluntary consensus standards. The draft proposed standard updates these requirements 
to conform to current ANSI standards and recognized industry safe work practices.  In addition, 
the proposal reorganizes the safety provisions to permit more flexibility in compliance by 
eliminating many overly specific requirements in favor of more performance-oriented 
requirements.  The draft standard clarifies employers’ responsibilities for guarding against fall 
hazards and for otherwise providing fall protection equipment. It also adds new requirements for 
training in the use of fall protection equipment and about falls and other walking and working 
surface hazards, and provides for additional hazard inspections of steps, ladders, and surfaces.  
OSHA has prepared a new draft section, §1910.140, to be added to Subpart I covering personal 
fall protection equipment. Table 1-1 shows the individual sections and paragraphs contained in 
the draft Subpart D and I standards, dated May 2007.

This document presents the benefit assessment and a cost and economic impact analysis 
of these draft standards. Section Two presents a profile of the affected industries, while Section
Three provides an assessment of compliance costs likely to be imposed by the draft standard. An 
analysis of the prospective benefits is presented in Section Four. Finally, Section Five contains 
an analysis of industry-specific economic impacts resulting from promulgation of the draft 
standards.

SECTION TWO
2. INDUSTRY PROFILE
This section presents a profile of the industries affected by OSHA’s draft General 
Industry Subpart D and I standards. Section 2.1 provides statistics describing the numbers of 
establishments and employees in the covered industries, while Section 2.2 shows estimates of the 
numbers of employees in such industries that use fall protection equipment. Finally, Section 2.3 
provides industry-specific estimates of the production worker and supervisor wage rates used in 
the cost analysis.
2.1 PROFILE OF GENERAL INDUSTRY ESTABLISHMENTS AND 
EMPLOYMENT
Table 2-1 provides economic profile statistics for the 4-digit NAICS industries covered 
by the draft standard. Based on U.S. Census’ Statistics of U.S. Businesses for 2003, the table 
shows that 6.4 million establishments and 106.5 million employees fall under the purview of the 
draft standards.  ERG also used the Census data on payroll and receipts from the same source to 
estimate average revenues per establishment in 2003 for each 4-digit NAICS industry. The 
methodology for deriving these estimates is discussed in Section Five.
Parts of the draft standard that cover ladders, scaffolds, and other working surfaces are 
most likely to directly affect workers engaged in maintenance and related activities. To estimate 
the numbers of such employees, ERG relied on data from Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) 
Occupational Employment Statistics Survey (OES) that document employment by detailed 
occupation on a 4-digit NAICS industry basis. ERG used these data to estimate the numbers of 
employees in construction and in maintenance, installation, and repair occupations in each 
2-2
industry and the overall number of production workers.1 The BLS data represent the only source 
of industry-specific statistics on detailed occupational employment totals. Because industry 
employment totals reported by the OES are not identical to those estimated by the U.S. Census, 
ERG used the ratios of production to total employment as reported by OES and total 
employment as reported by the Census to estimate the numbers of production workers and 
workers in maintenance-related occupations for each NAICS industry covered by the draft 
Subpart D & I standards. These estimates are also shown in Table 2-1. As the table shows, an 
estimated 27.6 million workers are employed in production occupations, while an estimated 5.3 
million are employed in construction, installation, and maintenance and repair occupations.
2.2 PROFILE OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED SMALL ENTITIES
ERG also developed profiles of small entities in the industries covered by the draft 
OSHA standards. First, ERG used the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) small business 
criterion for each industry and the Census’s Statistics of U. S. Business data on employment, 
payroll, and receipts by entity size to estimate the numbers of entities and associated 
employment meeting the SBA definitions.2 Where the SBA small business criterion was 
specified as a revenue threshold, ERG used the Census data to associate that revenue with a 
given employment size. The resultant SBA employment-size criteria are shown in the first 
column in Table 2-2. The table shows the numbers of entities and employees and average 
receipts per entity for those that meet the given size criterion. The numbers of at-risk workers are 
estimated assuming the same percentage of total employment as shown in Table 2-1.  ERG also 
used the Census’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses data to develop a profile of entities that employ 
fewer than 20 employees. These estimates are shown in Table 2-3..
                                                
1 Production workers include those in building and grounds; construction; installation, maintenance, and repair; 
production; and material moving occupations. It is conceivable that workers in construction and related occupations, 
even though not employed by establishments in construction industries, might on occasion perform work that would 
be regulated by OSHA under its construction standards in §1926. To the extent this is true, their employers might 
also be required to meet the requirements for fall protection and walking and working surfaces as specified in the 
construction standards.

2.3 EMPLOYEES USING FALL PROTECTION
ERG estimated the numbers of workers using fall protection equipment by 
extrapolating results obtained from OSHA’s 1999 PPE Cost Survey. This establishment-
based survey provided industry-specific estimates of the numbers of workers who used 
various types of personal protective equipment, including body harnesses and body belts. 
3The survey reported the percent of employees in each industry (SIC classification) that used 
these equipment types. ERG extrapolated the survey findings by first associating the SIC 
industries covered by the survey with 4-digit NAICS industries and then multiplying the 
equipment use percentages by total employment as shown in Table 2-1. Because the same 
employees might use both body harnesses and body belts, ERG used the maximum value of 
the two percentages in deriving these estimates. For example, if for a given industry, six 
percent of employees were estimated using body harnesses while four percent were 
estimated to use body belts, ERG used the larger six percent statistic as its estimate of the 
share of workers using fall protection. Also, the survey’s design did not permit industry-
specific estimates for all industries. For example, only aggregated estimates are available for 
several groups of service, wholesale, and retail trade industries. To make the fall protection 
estimates consistent with the numbers of at-risk workers, ERG constrained the estimated 
number of employees using fall protection in any industry to be less than or equal to the 
numbers of workers in construction, installation, maintenance, and repair occupations as 
shown in Table 2-1. Table 2-4 presents, by 4-digit NAICS industries, the resultant estimates 
of the numbers of workers using fall protection equipment. Overall, the table shows an 
estimated 1.6 million employees in General Industry using fall protection.

Base Year, DOL Contract No. J-9-F-9-0010. June 23, 1999 (Exhibit 14, OSHA Docket S-042: Costs of 
Personal Protective Equipment).  Back support belts and similar ergonomic devices were explicitly excluded 
from the types of personal protective equipment investigated by the survey.

2.4 WAGE RATES
As discussed in Section Three, much of the cost impact of the draft standard is associated 
with the time requirements for additional training and inspections. Estimates for these costs 
depend on the opportunity cost of the labor hours that would otherwise be devoted to productive 
activities. Such opportunity costs are typically valued in terms of workers’ hourly wages, 
adjusted for benefit and fringe costs. ERG relied on average hourly earnings as reported by the 
BLS, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey and constructed a weighted average hourly 
wage for the specific occupations comprising production employment. ERG similarly 
constructed an average hourly production supervisor wage for each industry. These wages were 
then inflated by a factor to account for fringe benefits. According to a recent BLS survey, this 
mark-up factor averaged 42.6 percent.4 The resultant wage rates are shown in Table 2-5.

.SECTION THREE
3. COST ANALYSIS
This cost analysis begins with a discussion of the assumptions used in the analysis 
(Section 3.1). The discussion focuses on what constitutes the regulatory baseline (i.e., current 
conditions) from which the costs, impacts, and benefits of the draft rule are measured. The role 
of consensus standards and the compliance rates for the existing rule are also discussed for their 
impact on the cost analysis (i.e., where codification of existing consensus standards result in no 
incremental costs for the draft rule.)
Section 3.2 reviews the draft rule on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis for those paragraphs 
that potentially could result in costs to industry. Table 3-4 provides a summary of the paragraphs 
that need further examination for the cost analysis.
Section 3.3 examines one-time costs to bring the existing employees in industry into 
compliance with the draft rule as well as the annual costs for training new employees and 
retraining existing employees that require it. ERG estimates costs for each industry affected 
under a specific paragraph. Tables 3-10 through 3-12 summarize the costs for each section and 
aggregate them to estimate the cost of the draft rule.
3.1 COST METHODOLOGY
This section addresses the methodology for assessing compliance cost implications of 
national consensus standards for the equipment, training, and hazard assessment requirements 
specified in the OSHA standard. In some cases, OSHA has used the consensus standards in 
developing its own equipment requirements. In most cases, OSHA has included a grandfather 
clause exempting employers from the need to immediately upgrade noncompliant equipment. 
The questions addresses are:
3-2
 What is the appropriate baseline for estimating incremental compliance costs?
 When does “grandfathering” result in “future” compliance costs as employers 
replace equipment covered by the grandfather clauses?
 If such future compliance costs do result, how should they be calculated?
Section 3.1.1 discusses the regulatory baseline (“baseline”) and its relationship to 
national consensus standards. This relationship affects if and how certain types of costs are 
considered. Section 3.1.2 examines the relationship between national consensus standards and 
compliance costs for OSHA standards. Section 3.1.3 considers compliance costs when OSHA 
requirements are equivalent to national consensus standards, while Section 3.1.4 discusses the 
case where the OSHA standard is more stringent than the consensus standard. Section 3.1.5 
addresses the compliance costs issues associated with grandfather clauses. Section 3.1.6 
discusses current compliance rates and section 3.1.7 presents the compliance met by least cost 
method.
3.1.1 OMB Guidance and National Consensus Standards
OMB’s guidance on regulatory analysis (OMB, 2003) recommends developing a baseline 
against which to measure the costs of a rule. The baseline should be the best assessment of the 
way the world would look absent the proposed regulation and it is frequently assumed to 
resemble the present. The present includes existing national consensus standards. For example, 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) publishes consensus standards on portable ladders 
(ANSI, 2000 and 2002). Although these standards are voluntary, virtually all domestic ladder 
manufacturers design and fabricate ladders that meet these standards. 
The baseline as defined by these consensus standards evolves over time, as these 
standards are revised and new versions published. For example, the ANSI standard for fixed 
ladders that was in place when the existing Subpart D standards were promulgated in the early 
1970s was revised and updated in 1984. To be consistent with OMB guidance on estimating 
costs, the point against which to measure costs is the present (or, more precisely, when the rule 
goes into effect) including the national consensus standards in effect at that time. That is, 
3-3
compliance costs should mirror common practice as reflected in these consensus standards and 
consider the extent to which existing equipment is likely to conform to the associated 
specifications.
This baseline is illustrated by a hypothetical example in Figure 3-1. The y-axis is 
measured in terms of increased worker protection, while the x-axis shows the time in years. The 
first worker protection level is that set by the first OSHA regulation promulgated in 1971. In this 
example, three voluntary standards have been adopted, each providing an increased level of 
worker protection. The stair-step line is the OMB baseline where each increase in worker 
protection corresponds to the adoption of a revised voluntary standard. The baseline remains 
level from the present into the future because the requirements in future voluntary standards are 
not known and cannot be incorporated into the forecast baseline.
The star on the left-hand side of the figure represents an establishment that exceeded 
OSHA requirements at the time its equipment was installed. In the intervening period, however, 
voluntary standards have increased the level of worker protection beyond that provided in the 
establishment. The star on the right-hand side of the figure is that establishment at the time the 
OSHA revised standard takes effect. This establishment will incur a cost if the standard requires 
retrofit to meet the OSHA requirement. These retrofit costs, however, are avoided, in the present 
at least, through the inclusion of a “grandfather” clause. Whenever the employer replaces this 
equipment in the future, it must be upgraded to meet the OSHA standard and thus would incur 
costs necessary to meet the worker protection level associated with the OSHA standard as shown 
in the figure. Grandfather clauses are discussed in more detail in Section 3.1.5.
In the example shown in Figure 3-1, two possibilities are shown for the level of 
protection afforded by the OSHA standard. One level is equivalent to the national consensus 
standard, while the second requires a higher level of safety. When the OSHA standard is 
equivalent to a national consensus standard, there may be a cost associated with the change from 
a voluntary standard to a mandatory one, but it is the same cost that would be incurred if the 
employer otherwise complied with the consensus standard. This is discussed in Section 3.1.3. 
When the OSHA requirement is stricter than the national consensus standard (i.e., the baseline), 
there is an incremental cost that will be borne by the entire regulated community beyond what 
3-4
would be required if all employers conformed to the consensus standards (see Section 3.1.4 for 
further discussion). 
While a grandfather clause relieves an establishment from having to immediately upgrade 
or retrofit its equipment, the employer will rebuild, refurbish, or re-equip at a time of his/her own 
choosing, depending on when the equipment was purchased or installed and the equipment 
lifetime. Whenever this happens, the appropriate baseline, we argue, is the national consensus 
currently in place at that time. For an employer to incur a cost attributable to the OSHA standard 
depends on whether it is possible not to comply with the standard. In the example given above, 
an employer has no option other than buying a portable ladder built to an ANSI standard.

3.1.2 OSHA Standards and Existing Consensus Standards
3.1.2.1 Background
OSHA has used consensus standards extensively as a basis for its mandatory safety and 
health standards since the earliest days of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH 
Act). Under section 6(a) of the OSH Act, OSHA was given the authority for a period of two 
years to adopt both national consensus standards and establish Federal standards as OSHA 
standards without following notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Using Section 6(a), the 
Agency adopted many consensus standards as OSHA standards.
If a national consensus standard exists, it is the “baseline” reflecting current national 
consensus standards against which incremental costs and benefits of the regulation are measured. 
If the new regulatory language requires a level of safety equivalent to that in an existing 
consensus standard, then there is no difference between the proposed regulatory language and the 
baseline. What has changed, however, is that the requirement is not mandatory rather than 
voluntary. Thus, the costs are those associated with the change from a voluntary standard to a 
mandatory standard. These are only incurred by that part of the population that currently does not 
comply with voluntary standards. If, however, the standard is more stringent than the consensus 
standard, all employers incur compliance costs solely attributable to the OSHA regulation.
3.1.2.2 Feasibility of Not Complying with Consensus Standards
As we have noted, future compliance costs may be incurred by employers whose 
equipment as currently installed is grandfathered under the OSHA standard. Even though no 
retrofitting is required, the employer is required to upgrade this equipment (e.g. fixed ladders) to 
meet OSHA’s standard whenever that equipment is replaced in the future. As we argue, in many 
(perhaps most) cases, the employer has no choice but to upgrade his equipment to meet the 
OSHA standard, as equipment designers, engineers and architects will require the upgrades to 
meet the same consensus standards that the OSHA regulation are based on. In this case, when the 
OSHA standard and the consensus standard are identical, we say that noncompliance is unlikely. 
3-7
If, however, the OSHA standard is more stringent than the consensus standard or no 
comprehensive consensus standard exists, then employers might incur upgrade costs that are 
higher than they would otherwise incur in the absence of the regulation. In this case, 
noncompliance is possible and might be the preferred choice of employers.
Since we posit that employers have no choice but to install equipment that meets current 
consensus standards (assuming one or more exist), the incremental cost of the OSHA standard is 
the difference between the cost of meeting the (possibly) more stringent OSHA standard and the 
cost of designing and installing the equipment to meet the (possibly) less stringent consensus 
standard. In our view, the fact that the current consensus standard may be more stringent than the 
standard that was in place when any existing equipment was designed and installed does not by 
itself result in incremental costs that can be attributed to OSHA’s standard. Thus no compliance 
costs result if noncompliance is improbable.
If noncompliance is more probable (see Section 3.1.6 for current compliance rates), the 
magnitude of the compliance costs from the perspective of a regulatory cost analysis depends, 
first, on the differential between the cost of the upgrade needed to comply with the OSHA 
standard and the cost of the upgrade that the employer would otherwise undertake. Second, since 
regulatory costs are measured in terms of their present value equivalents, the cost depends on 
how far into the future the prospective upgrades would be undertaken and the discount rate used 
to calculate the present values.
ERG considers three types of costs in the evaluation of the proposed Subpart D language:
 Training costs and costs from other work-practice requirements, such as 
inspection and hazard assessment
 Stand-alone equipment costs, such as for portable ladders, and
 Installed walking-working surface equipment costs, such as for fixed ladders.
First, training and other work practice-related costs are typically recurring costs and are 
not subject to grandfather-type provisions. Even one-time training requirements impose ongoing 
costs as new employees enter the job market. Furthermore, compliance with these requirements 
3-8
is not controlled by consensus standards to the same extent as compliance with equipment 
requirements.
Second, some equipment addressed by the OSHA standard, such as portable ladders or 
mobile ladder stands, is commercially produced and purchased in ready-to-use conditions by 
employers. ERG argues that such equipment, in virtually all cases, will be designed and 
fabricated to meet current consensus standards. This is due to the fact that equipment 
manufacturers will seek to avoid (1) the small market represented by employers that would 
purchase non-compliant equipment and (2) the liabilities associated with the manufacture of non-
compliant equipment. For example, a walk through a hardware store will indicate that each 
ladder is marked to identify the ANSI standard to which it is built. Therefore, as a ladder needs 
to be replaced, the replacement will meet the current standard. Even longer-lived equipment, 
such as a mobile ladder stand, is advertised as meeting ANSI requirements. In other words, an 
employer would not be able to purchase a ladder (or other stand-alone equipment) that did not 
meet current voluntary standards. The possibility does exist of importing equipment that may not 
meet consensus standards. The 2006 Performance and Accountability Report of the U.S. 
Consumer Product Commission (CPSC) noted that roughly two-thirds of their product recalls 
involve imported products. ERG argues that some imported equipment might be produced to 
specifications provided by domestic vendors that are based on the requirements in the ANSI 
standards. It is conceivable, however, that other vendors might misrepresent the technical 
specifications of equipment that did not fully meet the ANSI requirements. To address the 
question of substandard imports, a cost is assigned for due diligence on the part of the employer 
to ensure the equipment meet all the ANSI requirements. Otherwise we conclude that 
noncompliance with consensus standards is unlikely.
A third type of cost is associated with walking-working-related equipment – such as fixed 
ladders, stairways, or ramps- that must be designed and constructed to fit site-specific 
dimensions and requirements. Installed surfaces often have lifetimes comparable to the structures 
to which they are attached, e.g., fixed ladders. Typically, an employer would use architects, 
engineers, and/or contractors (possible in-house resources) to design, fabricate and install such 
equipment. While it is conceivable that en employer might insist on installing nonconforming 
equipment, ERG believes that professional standards for architects and engineers, local building 
3-9
codes, and potential liability concerns would dictate that virtually all employers would 
voluntarily choose to upgrade equipment so as to conform to existing national consensus 
standards. For these reasons, ERG concludes that noncompliance with consensus standards is 
also unlikely for fixed equipment requirements.
3.1.3 OSHA Requirements Equivalent to National Consensus Standards
Figure 3-2 is a logic flow diagram outlining the process for identifying costs associated 
with new regulatory language. The starting point is a side-by-side, provision-by-provision 
comparison of the existing and new regulatory language. In many cases, the language might have 
changed to enhance the understandability of the regulation without a change in the scope of 
activities covered or requirement for an employer to provide a safe workplace. In some cases, the 
revised language gives the employer additional methods to provide a level of safety equivalent to 
that specific in the original language. Such changes result in de minimis costs to the employer.
If there is a change from the existing to the proposed language, the second decision point 
is to determine whether the proposed language is equivalent to an existing consensus standard. If 
it is, then the cost associated with the new language is the change from a voluntary standard to a 
mandatory standard, see Section 3.1.2.1. Table 3.1 is a listing of national consensus standard and 
the associated section of the draft rule. If the draft rule does not contain more stringent 
requirements than an existing national consensus standard, and equipment purchased or installed 
meet these standards, no costs are assigned to the rule. Costs are assigned, however, for the 
portion of the industry that is not currently complying with the voluntary standard to comply 
with the mandatory requirement (see Section 3.1.6 for the current compliance rates). As we have 
argued, however, costs are attributable to the OSHA standard only if the employer has the option 
to not comply with the consensus standard.
Third, the presence or absence of a grandfather clause determines whether costs are 
incurred by existing establishments to retrofit and upgrade to the new requirements when the 
standard is implemented (retrofit costs, see Figure 3-1) or only when establishments replace 
infrastructure or equipment at a time of the employer’s choosing (future costs). Section 3.1.5 
discusses the effect of grandfather clauses in more detail. However, given that an OSHA 
3-10
requirement is equivalent to a national consensus standard, it is possible that this consensus is 
incorporated into the baseline conditions so strongly that it is not probable for the employer to do 
anything but comply. If an employer has no other choice than to comply with a requirement, then 
there is no cost for compliance attributable to the regulation.

3.1.4 OSHA Requirements More Stringent Than National Consensus 
Standards
Figure 3-3 is the logic flow for identifying costs associated with OSHA language that 
contain more stringent safety requirements than an existing consensus standard or where no 
consensus standard exists. In this case, we assume that non-complying options exist. If there is 
no grandfather clause, then all employers will incur retrofit costs to meet the new requirement in 
the year in which the regulation becomes effective. If there is a grandfather clause, then costs are 
incurred as old equipment is replaced or new facilities are built. In each case, the magnitude of 
compliance costs from a regulatory cost analysis perspective depends on the differential between 
the cost of the upgrade needed to achieve conformity with the consensus standard. In the 
3-14
grandfather clause case, the cost analysis must consider timing of equipment replacement within 
each affected industry and the appropriate discount rate for calculating the present value of the 
resultant compliance costs.
3.1.5 Grandfather Clauses
A “grandfather” clause contains language such as “Fixed ladders installed on or after 
[insert date one year after the effective date of the final rule published in the Federal Register] 
must meet the following requirements:…” As shown in Figure 3-1, if there is no grandfather 
clause, all workplaces must retrofit to meet the provision in the year the regulation becomes 
effective.
If there is a grandfather clause, costs might be incurred in the future as employers install 
new equipment to replace worn out equipment. However, when the replacement time is reached, 
the baseline for comparison is formed by the national consensus standards in effect at the time of 
the replacement. However, for the purpose of this cost analysis, ERG assumes the baseline is 
formed by the national consensus standards in effect in 2007. If the proposed OSHA 
requirements are not stricter than the current voluntary standards, then a cost would be incurred 
only by those who would not have complied with the voluntary standard.
Grandfather clauses work to lessen the potential costs to the employer through two 
mechanisms:
 The value of avoided costs (time delay, see Section 3.1.5.1), and
 The shift from a retrofit cost to an incremental cost (see Section 3.1.5.2).
3-15
Figure 3-3. Cost Methodology Logic Flow – OSHA Requirements Exceed 
Consensus Standard
3-16
3.1.5.1 Value of Avoided Costs
Regulatory costs are measured in terms of their present value equivalents. Thus the cost 
depends on the discount rate used to calculate the present values and on how many years into the 
future before the prospective upgrades would be undertaken. Applying a 7.5 percent discount 
rate – a rate used here for illustrative purposes – to calculate present values and annualized costs, 
the following figures shows the present value of $1,000 in compliance costs incurred at different 
years in the future.
Current Year: $1,000.00
Year 2: $930.23
Year 5: $748.80
Year 10: $521.58
So a five-year delay in upgrading reduces the present value of compliance costs by about 25 
percent, while a 10-year delay reduces the costs by about half.
Where the OSHA standard is based on current consensus standards, the likelihood of 
non-compliance depends on the age of the equipment. The older the equipment, the more likely 
it was designed and installed prior to the date of current consensus standards. Non-compliance 
also depends on the typical lifetime of the equipment. If the equipment is relatively short-lived 
(such as portable ladders), then it is more likely that a substantial part of the equipment stock in 
use has been designed, fabricated, and installed under the auspices of the current version of the 
consensus standard.
3.1.5.2 The Shift from a Retrofit Cost to an Incremental Cost
Without a grandfather clause, an employer must immediately upgrade when the rule 
becomes effective. This might mean, for example, ripping down a relatively new fixed ladder 
and rebuilding it to meet the new requirements. The retrofit cost is the entire cost of the new 
fixed ladder, and the remaining economic value of the existing equipment lost. With a 
grandfather clause, the employer can wait until the fixed ladder is worn out and needs replacing. 
The costs for design and labor to build the replacement fixed ladder are likely to be very similar 
whether the ladder meets the original or updated standard. What will change is the cost for the 
stronger materials to meet the updated standard, e.g., from supporting a single live load of 200 
3-17
pounds to supporting two live loads of 250 pounds each. The incremental cost for heavier bolts, 
thicker steel, or the addition of supporting members is the incremental costs associated with the 
updated standard. The incremental costs cannot be quantified except on a case-by-case basis, but 
are likely to be small relative to the overall cost of replacement.
Table 3-2 lists the paragraphs in the draft regulation with new requirements that include a 
“grandfather” provision. Due to this provision, no costs will be incurred for modification or 
replacement of equipment in these paragraphs.
Table 3-2. Paragraphs with Grandfather Provisions
Paragraph Subject
§1910.23(d)(2) Fixed ladders must be designed, constructed, and maintained as follows: (i) 
Fixed ladders must be capable of supporting two live loads of at least 250 
pounds each, concentrated between any two consecutive attachments, plus 
anticipated loads caused by ice buildup, winds, rigging, and impact loads 
resulting from the use of ladder safety devices... (ii) Each step or rung must 
be capable of supporting at least a single concentrated load of 250 pounds 
applied in the middle of the step or rung.
§1910.24(a)(1) All step bolts that are used in corrosive environments must be constructed 
of, or coated with, a material that will retard corrosion of the step or bolt.
§1910.24(a)(7) Each step bolt installed must be capable of supporting, without failure, at 
least four times its maximum intended load.
§1910.24(b)(2) The employer must ensure that manhole steps: (i) are provided with slip-
resistant surfaces such as, corrugated, knurled, or dimpled surfaces; (ii) 
used in corrosive environment are constructed of, or coated with, a material 
that will retard corrosion of the step; (iii) have a minimum clear step width 
of 10 inches; (iv) are spaced uniformly, not more than 16 inches apart; (v) 
have a minimum perpendicular distance between the centerline of the 
manhole step to the nearest permanent object in back of the step of at least 
4.5 inches; and (vi) are designed to prevent the employee's foot from 
slipping or sliding off the end of the manhole step.
§1910.25(a)(6) When a door or a gate opens directly on a stairway, a platform must be 
provided, and the swing of the door or gate must not reduce the effective 
usable depth to less than 22 inches.
§1910.26(b) Dockboards must be designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent 
equipment from running off the edge.
§1910.29(f)(1)(ii) The height of stair rail systems must not be less than 36 inches.
3-18
3.1.6 Current Compliance Rates
The baseline should be the assessment of the way the world would look absent the 
regulation and is frequently assumed to resemble the present. The baseline, then includes 
compliance rates with the existing Subpart D and Subpart I as well as with national consensus 
standards.
Current Compliance Rates: Table 3-3 presents the fiscal year 2005 OSHA inspections, 
subdivided by industry sector, that resulted in a citation (OSHA, 2006a). The columns in Table 
3-3 tabulate cases where a citation was issued for any reason and also included non-compliance 
with a section of 29 CFR 1910 Subpart D. The non-compliance rates in Table 3-3 are overstated 
because there are inspections with no citations that are not included in this estimate. The upper-
bound non-compliance rates for floor guarding requirements in Section §1910.23 vary by 
industry. Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate has the lowest non-compliance rate (2.8 percent), 
while Wholesale Trade has the highest non-compliance rate (13.6 percent). The non-compliance 
rates drop for fixed industrial stair requirements, which range from 0 percent (Finance, 
Insurance, and Real Estate) to 2.7 percent (Wholesale Trade). For the remaining paragraphs 
(portable wood ladders, portable metal ladders, fixed ladders, scaffolding, and manually 
propelled mobile ladder stands and scaffolds), non-compliance rates do not exceed 1.2 percent. 
That is, for §1910.25-§1910.28, the assumption of 100 percent industry compliance is 
reasonable. That is, costs are only incurred when the draft requirements exceed or would be more 
costly than the current requirements. However, where costs might be incurred under more 
stringent requirements, the upper-bound non-compliance rate for existing requirements can be 
used as an estimate of the proportion of facilities that might incur costs under the draft rule.
If meeting an existing requirement would also meet the draft requirement, no costs are 
assigned to the provision. For example, the draft language for §1910.23(d)(12)(ii) specifies that 
the step-across distance from the centerline of the steps or rungs of a fixed ladder to the 
access/egress point of the platform edge for side step ladders must be between 15 and 20 inches. 
Based on Figure D-10 in the existing standard, the maximum space from the edge of the ladder 
to the platform (i.e., access/egress point) is 12 inches. As noted in the previous paragraph, the 
centerline width for a fixed ladder is 8 inches. The total step-across distance under the

existing standard is 20 inches. Thus, a fixed ladder that meets the current requirements also 
meets the draft requirements; and no costs are assigned to this paragraph.
3.1.7 Compliance Met By Least Cost Method
In a cost impact analysis, an employer is always assumed to meet a regulatory 
requirement by choosing the least expensive means to do so. Thus, if the draft regulation 
identifies several other means of meeting a requirement along with the current method, the 
employers would be expected to select the least cost method. It then follows that if the 
alternative method specified in the draft regulation is more expensive than the current method, 
the employer would be expected to use the current method to meet the requirement. For example, 
under §1910.28(b)(1), an employer can meet the duty to have fall protection for an employee on 
a walking-working surface with an unprotected side or edge by (1) the use of guardrail systems, 
safety net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or travel restraint systems, or (2) an employee 
must work in a designated area. The current regulation specifies Approach (1) while the draft 
regulation specifies either Approach (1) or (2). Thus, in this case, no costs were assigned to the 
draft §1910.28(b)(1). There might be a cost savings to an employer. However, those savings are 
not estimated in this report.
3.2 PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH REVIEW
This section provides a brief paragraph-by-paragraph review of the draft rule. Only 
requirements that might involve costs incremental to those beyond current requirements and 
national consensus standards are described.
Table 3-4 summarizes the paragraphs that, as currently written, might result in costs to 
the employer. These are primarily inspection and training costs. For the purpose of this analysis, 
ERG distinguishes between informal and formal training. For example, draft §1910.23(b)(11) 
states that an employee must face the ladder when ascending or descending the ladder. ERG 
assumes such instruction can be done on an in-house basis with materials such as OSHA training 
videos. When training is done on an informal basis, ERG does not assign an administrative costs 
for the employer to document that the training has taken place. When the draft language uses the 
3-21
words “trained” or “training,” ERG assumes the instruction is done on a more formal basis, 
possibly with an outside person being hired to provide the course. ERG assumes that an 
employer will choose to maintain documentation of all formal training and ERG thus assigns a 
cost for the administrative task.
Finally, several paragraphs say that training must be done in accordance with §1910.30, 
see:
 §1910.27(b)(2)(ii): Rope descent systems,
 §1910.28(b)(1): Unprotected sides and edges,
 §1910.28(b)(10)(v): Outdoor advertising
in Table 3-4. The costs for §1910.30 include the costs for the paragraphs listed above.

costs because they fall under any of the situations described in Section 3.1 are not discussed here.

while Section 3.2.11 discusses the requirements in draft Subpart I.

There are no costs assigned to §1910.21 Scope, application, and definitions.
3-23
3.2.2 §1910.22 General Requirements
3.2.2.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.22(d). Maintenance and repair. The paragraph involves new requirements for the 
employer to inspect the walking-working surfaces, guard hazardous conditions to prevent 
employee use until the hazard is corrected, and the repair or maintenance work is inspected by a 
qualified person. These costs are considered in Section 3.3.2 and are assumed to include the costs 
for inspection described in §1910.28 (see Section 3.3.6).
3.2.2.2 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.22(c). Access and egress. The employer must ensure that employees are provided 
with and use a safe means of access to, and egress from one walking-working surface to another. 
The language in the existing §1910.22(b) concerns aisles and passageways. Aisles and 
passageways must be kept clear, in good repair, and with no obstruction across or in aisles that 
could create a hazard. ERG interprets the language in the draft §1910.22(c) to generalize the 
terms “aisles” and “passageways” to cover all means of access and egress. The change results in 
the terminology in the draft rule being consistent with that in a consensus standard (NFPA 101). 
Thus, §1910.22(c) is assigned no costs.
3.2.3 §1910.23 Ladders
§1910.23 begins with provisions that apply to all ladders (§1910.23(b)) and then has 
provisions applicable to specific types of ladders, such as portable ladders (§1910.23(c)), fixed 
ladders (§1910.23(d)), and mobile ladder stands and mobile ladders stand platforms 
(§1910.23(e).
3-24
3.2.3.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.23(b)(11-13), §1910.23(c)(5-6), (10-11), and (13). These eight paragraphs include 
instructions to the employee on proper use of the ladders. These requirements are summarized in 
Table 3-7 in Section 3.3.3. §1910.23(c)(5) prohibits the use of single-rail ladders. This is 
consistent with the requirements for the construction industry standard at §1926.1053(b)(19). 
Thus the requirement not to use a single-rail ladder is a matter of training. The wide availability 
of permitted ladders means there are no equipment costs associated with the prohibition. 
Training costs are considered in Section 3.3.3.
§1910.23(e). Mobile ladder stands and mobile ladder stand platforms designed, used, and 
maintained in accordance with the applicable standard from ANSI A14 series as of (insert 
effective date of this standard) are deemed to be in compliance with this section. The only 
provision that does not have a corresponding requirement in the national consensus standard is 
§1910.23(e)(1)(vii) – occupied mobile ladder stands and platforms must not be moved. 
§1910.23(e)(1)(vii) is a work practice requirement and compliance is achieved through ladder 
safety training and enforcement. Therefore, any cost for §1910.23(e)(1)(vii) is not associated 
with the equipment costs due to the grandfather clause, but with workplace practices addressed 
through training. See Section 3.3.3 for ladder safety training costs.
All other provisions meet the national consensus standard. An investigation of fiscal year 
2005 OSHA data for inspections with Subpart D citations indicates that the failure to provide 
safe ladders is very low (e.g., 0.2 percent of inspections with citations included violations for 
portable wood ladders, 0.4 percent for metal ladders, and 0.8 percent for fixed ladders). Based on 
these data, we might infer that there is a near-100 percent intent to provide safe (i.e., OSHA 
compliant) ladders by employers. With a near-100 percent compliance rate with the current 
consensus standards no costs are assigned for equipment upgrades (see Section 3.1.2.2). 
However, costs are assigned for due diligence on the part of the employer to ensure the 
equipment meet all the ANSI requirements.
3-25
3.2.3.2 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.23(a). Application. The draft paragraph covers special wood ladders specifically 
excluded in the existing language, including fruit picker’s ladders, combination step and 
extension ladders, stockroom stepladders, aisle-way stepladders, shelf ladders, and library 
ladders. However, these ladders are assumed to meet consensus standards for wooden ladders so 
no costs are incurred with the expanded application.
§1910.23(b)(4)(iii) concerning rolling ladders in communications centers was moved 
from §1910.268(h)(5)—Telecommunications. Thus, this is not a new requirement.
§1910.23(b)(9). Both existing and draft standards have a requirement to inspect ladders 
before use. Based on discussion with OSHA, ERG does not interpret the draft language to imply 
more frequent inspections than currently performed.
§1910.23(c)(14). The reach of the ladder and ladder sections must not be increased by 
any means unless specifically designed for the application. Ladders and ladder sections cannot be 
tied or fastened together to provide longer length unless the equipment is designed for this 
purpose. This provision might cause the employer to incur a cost if it is necessary to purchase a 
longer ladder of sufficient length for the task. However, the existing regulations at 
§1910.25(d)(2)(ix) and §1910.26(c)(3)(vi) specify that neither wood nor metal portable ladders 
may be spliced, tied, or fastened together to create a longer section unless the manufacturer has 
designed the equipment for such a purpose. The draft language, then, expands the prohibition to 
all other means of joining sections. There are no data estimating the frequency of such 
occurrences but, presumably, these are rare. Thus, we do not assign a cost to this paragraph.
§1910.23(d)(2). Fixed ladders installed on or after [insert date 90 days after the effective 
date of the final rule in the Federal Register] must be capable of supporting 2 live loads of at 
least 250 pounds, concentrated between any two consecutive attachments, plus anticipated loads 
caused by ice build-up, etc. Each rung must be capable of supporting at least a single 
concentrated load of 250 pounds. The new language reflects the consensus standard in ANSI 
14.3, however, the existing language specifies a single concentrated load of 200 pounds. 
3-26
ERG estimated that there are approximately 3.1million fixed ladders over 20 feet in
length in the Untied States (see Appendix A). The requirement to be able to support two loads of 
250 pounds each dates back to the 1984 version of ANSI A14.3. It is therefore highly likely that 
much of the population of existing fixed ladders was built when the 250-pound requirement was 
in the voluntary standard. However, we do not know the age distribution of fixed ladders in the 
United States or when a ladder had its most recent reconstruction.
The cost differential for each ladder is the difference between a design to support one live 
load of 200 pounds and two live loads of 250 pounds each. Given that the fixed ladder must be 
constructed to fit a specific site, it is likely that the labor costs for either design would be 
comparable. Therefore, the cost attributable to the consensus standard is primarily attributable to 
the difference in materials, e.g., thicker steel. Such costs are likely to be highly site-specific and 
not estimable at this time. However, given (1) that the cost for materials is a fraction of the 
overall cost of building or rebuilding the fixed ladder, and (2) the incremental cost is the 
difference between the materials planned and materials needed, these incremental costs are likely 
to be small. Since these small costs are likely to only affect a small population of employers who 
are non-compliant with the current consensus standards no costs are estimated for this paragraph.
§1910.23(d)(12)(i). The draft language changes the definition of “step-across distance” to 
measure from the centerline of the steps or rungs of a fixed ladder. The existing definition 
measures the step-across distance from the nearest edge of the ladder to the nearest edge of the 
structure or equipment. The minimum distance under the draft language is 7 inches and 2.5 
inches under the existing language. The draft paragraph §1910.23(b)(4) specifies a minimum 
clear step or rung width of 16 inches for individual rung and fixed ladders; thus the distance from 
the centerline to the inside edge of the ladder is 8 inches. Adding the existing requirement of 2.5 
inches from the nearest edge of the ladder to the nearest edge of the structure or equipment to the 
8-inch centerline width results in a step-across width of 10.5 inches. Thus any fixed ladder that 
meets the current requirements also meets the draft requirements. No costs are assigned to this 
paragraph.
§1910.23(d)(12)(ii). The draft language specifies that the step-across distance from the 
centerline of the steps or rungs of a fixed ladder to the access/egress point of the platform edge 
3-27
for side step ladders must be between 15 and 20 inches. Based on Figure D-10 in the existing 
standard, the maximum space from the edge of the ladder to the platform (i.e., access/egress 
point) is 12 inches. As noted in the previous paragraph, the centerline width for a fixed ladder is 
8 inches. The total step-across distance under the existing standard is 20 inches. Thus, a fixed 
ladder that meets the current requirements also meets the draft requirements. No costs are 
assigned to this paragraph.
3.2.4 §1910.24 Step Bolts and Manhole Steps
The requirements for step bolts are new to Subpart D. The preliminary regulatory impact 
analysis (RIA) for the draft rule notes “Manufactured products, such as ladders, step bolts, 
manhole steps…generally meet or exceed draft OSHA specifications.” (OSHA, 1990a). A 2003 
Standard Interpretation document comments that OSHA considers the IEEE 1307-1996 
consensus standard, in most cases, to prevent or eliminate serious hazards (OSHA, 2003a). IEEE 
1307-1996 defines “failure” in a step bolt as occurring when step bolts are bent greater than 0.26 
rad (15 degrees) below the horizontal, i.e., the requirement in the draft §1910.24(a)(9). IEEE 
revised the standard in 2004; thus we assume that industry is using the more up-to-date 
consensus standard.
3.2.4.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.24(a)(8) and §1910.24(b)(3). Step bolts and manhole steps must be visually 
inspected before each use. Inspection costs are considered in Section 3.3.4.
§1910.24(b). The language in the draft is summarized in Table 3-5 along with the 
corresponding section of ASTM C-478-06b.

Section
1910.24(b)(1)
Manhole steps installed before (insert date 90 days after the 
effective date of the final rule in the Federal Register) must be 
capable of supporting their maximum intended load.
1910.24(b)(2)
The employer must ensure that manhole steps installed on or after 
(insert date 90 days after the effective rule in the Federal Register):
1910.24(b)(2)(i)
Are provided with slip-resistant surfaces such as, corrugated, 
knurled, or dimpled surfaces;
1910.24(b)(2)(ii)
Used in corrosive environments are constructed of, or coated with, 
a material that will retard corrosion of the step;
1910.24(b)(2)(iii) Have a minimum clear step width of 10 inches (25 cm); 16.5.2
1910.24(b)(2)(iv)
Are spaced uniformly, not more than 16 inches apart. The spacing 
from the entry and exit surface to the first manhole step may be 
different from the spacing between other steps; 16.4.1
1910.24(b)(2)(v)
Have a minimum perpendicular distance between the centerline of 
the manhole step to the nearest permanent object in back of the 
step of at least 4.5 inches (11.4 cm); and 16.5.35
1910.24(b)(2)(vi)
Are designed to prevent the employee's foot from slipping or 
sliding off the end of the manhole step.
1910.24(b)(3)
Manhole steps must be visually inspected before each use and be 
maintained in accordance with 1910.22
There are three additional requirements that exceed what is specified in a national 
consensus standard for steps in pre-cast concrete manhole sections:
 Manhole steps must be provided with slip-resistant surfaces such as, corrugated, 
knurled, or dimpled surfaces;
                                                
5 ASTM C478-06b 16.5.3 specifies that the rung or cleat shall project a uniform clear distance of 4 inches minimum 
from the wall, to the embedment side of the rung.  The OSHA distance is measured from the centerline of the 
manhole step.  Thus, if a step is at least an inch wide, a step that meets the ASTM 4-inch requirement would also 
meet the OSHA 4.5 inch requirement.
3-29
 Manhole steps must be designed to prevent the employee's foot from slipping or 
sliding off the end of the manhole step;
 Manhole steps much be replaced if they are bent to such a degree that there is no 
longer 4 inches clearance to the wall.
ASTM C478-06b permits the use of uncoated or untreated ferrous steps as long as they are at 
least 1 inch in cross section, but says nothing about a slip-resistant surface or design. Due to the 
requirements that go beyond those in a consensus standard, when a manhole section needs to be 
built or replaced, there will be incremental costs for slip-resistant/corrosion-resistant surfaces. 
The paragraph now defines when a step has “failed” when still present in the manhole; thus there 
are also step replacement costs. These costs are discussed in Section 3.3.4.
3.2.4.2 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.24(a)(1). The draft reads:
“All step bolts installed on or after [insert date 90 days after the effective date of the final 
rule in the Federal Register] that are used in corrosive environments must be constructed 
of, or coated with, a material that will retard corrosion of the step or bolt.”
The most relevant national consensus standard is ASTM Standard Specification for Steel 
Transmission Tower Bolts, Zinc-Coated and Bare (ASTM A394-05). The appendix to the 
consensus standard mentions that the dimensions of ladder bolts, step bolts, and equipment 
support bolts shall be specified by the purchaser, thus the rest of the standard is applicable to step 
bolts. The standard describes three types of bolts covered by the standard:
 Type 0: hot-dip zinc-coated bolts made of low or medium carbon steel. (ASTM 394-05, 
Section 1.1.1)
 Type 1: hot-dip zinc-coated bolts made of medium carbon steel, quenched and tempered. 
(ASTM 394-05, Section 1.1.2)
 Type 3: Bare (uncoated), quenched and tempered bolts made of weathering steel (ASTM 
394-05, Section 1.1.4)6
                                                
6 Type 2 bolts were withdrawn in 2005.
3-30
Appendix A.2 of the consensus standard mentions that bolts should be Type 0 unless agreed 
upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. That is, the default condition is that the bolt is 
zinc-coated and therefore meets the proposed OSHA requirement for corrosion resistance. The 
use of any other bolt type implies that the manufacturer and purchaser have agreed that the bolt 
is appropriate for the intended environment and intended use. Since manufacturers of step bolts 
are unlikely to make non-compliant step bolts, this provision falls into the category of “non-
compliance is unlikely,” and no costs are assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.24(a)(6). The draft reads:
“Step bolts installed before [insert date 90 days after the effective date of the final rule in 
the Federal Register] must be capable of supporting their maximum intended load.”
The requirement that a step bolt must be capable of supporting its maximum intended load is 
consistent with IEEE 1307-2004; IEEE Standard for Fall Protection for Utility Work, Section 
9.1.1.1(d) which reads:
“d) Be capable of supporting the intended workload [as defined for the application per the 
applicable ANSI standard(s)], but in no case shall the minimum design live load be less 
than a simple concentrated load of 271 kg (598.4 lb) applied 51mm (2 inches) from the 
inside face of the step bolt head.”
No cost is therefore assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.24(a)(7) requires step bolts installed after the effective date of the rule to be
capable of supporting four times its maximum intended load. In the preamble to the proposed 
rule, OSHA says that it considers a 5/8-inch bolt to meet this requirement and that such size bolts 
are readily available.
3.2.5 §1910.25 Stairs and Stairways
3.2.5.1 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.25(a)(6). The original regulation says that for doors or gates that open directly on a 
stairway, a platform must be provided, and the swing of the door must not reduce the effective 
width to less than 20 inches. For platforms installed before 90 days after the effective date of the 
3-31
final rule there are no changes to the existing requirements and therefore no retrofit costs. For 
platforms installed on or after 90 days after the effective date of the final rule, the effective width 
is increased to 22 inches.7 The incremental cost is that associated with adding 2 inches in 
clearance to the platform whenever the platform is replaced. This is likely to be a minimal 
increase in materials cost borne by the employer to meet the consensus standard. For reasons 
given in Section 3.1.3, no incremental costs for meeting a consensus standard are attributable to 
the proposed OSHA standard.
§1910.25(c). The original regulation in §1910.25(b) did not permit spiral stairways 
except under special conditions. Under §1910.25(a)(9), spiral stairs, ship stairs, or alternating 
tread-type stairs are not permitted except for special limited usage and secondary access 
situations where it is not practicable to provide a standard stairway. Additional requirements for 
spiral stairs are listed in the draft language for §1910.25(c). An existing spiral staircase that does 
not meet the draft requirements for clear width, riser height, etc., would need to be modified or 
replaced. However, spiral staircases are likely to be relatively rare given that they are exceptions 
to the existing rule. In addition, a note to §1910.25(a)(1) indicates that employers in compliance 
with NFPA 101 (or Building Code) will be deemed to be in compliance with this paragraph. 
Therefore, if the spiral staircase is in compliance with NFPA 101, it meets the requirements in 
§1910.25(c)(1-5), see NFPA (2006). Thus, we do not assign costs to §1910.25(c).
§1910.25(d). This paragraph is a response from OSHA to an OMB initiated, government-
wide effort to reform regulation in the U.S. manufacturing sector. The Copper and Brass 
Fabricators Council submitted a comment that OSHA required the use of fixed stairs when ship 
stairs would be safer (OMB, 2005). Ship stairs typically are installed with slopes of 50 degrees or 
greater, however, the existing regulation for fixed stairs addressed stairs installed at angles 
between 30 and 50 degrees. Thus, ship stairs were not specifically addressed in the original 
interpretation. Recent standard interpretations indicate that if an inspection found a set of ship 
stairs at an establishment (a violation of the existing regulation) that conformed to the draft 
                                                
7 The 22-inch clearance requirement for new structures matches ANSI A1264, Section 6.11.
3-32
regulation, OSHA would consider it a de minimis violation8 (OSHA 2006b and 2006c). 
Therefore, the need to retrofit or replace a set of ship stairs under the draft rule would be minimal 
and no costs are assigned to §1910.25(d).
§1910.25(e). Alternating tread stairs were not specifically mentioned in the original 
regulation. A letter from OSHA to a manufacturer of alternating tread stairs deemed the stair 
design to be safe (OSHA, 1981). Alternating tread stairs are discussed in NFPA 101, Section 
7.2.11, therefore, any alternating tread stair that meets the requirements of NFPA 101 also meets 
the requirements draft in §1910.25(e). Thus, we do not assign costs to §1910.25(e).
3.2.6 §1910.26 Dockboards
3.2.6.1 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.26(b). The draft language reads:
Dockboards put into service on or after [insert date 90 days after the effective date of the 
final rule in the Federal Register] must be designed, constructed, and maintained to 
prevent equipment from running off the edge.”
The definition of a dockboard in ANSI MH30.2-2005 Section 2.2 contains the language “as well 
as providing a run-off guard, or curb.” Dockboards are manufactured by one company for sale to 
and use by another company. Following the logic of Section 3.1.2.2, if an employer orders a 
dockboard, it will have curbs. No costs for this provision are attributable to the rule.
                                                
8 i.e. a violation of minimum importance. For example, if ship stairs existed when they were supposedly banned, as 
long as they met the draft regulation, it would be an infraction but one so minor as to be below regulatory concern.
3-33
3.2.7 §1910.27 Scaffolds
3.2.7.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.27(b)(2)(ii). This paragraph codifies safety provisions presented in the 1991 
memorandum to the Regional Administrators, which are essentially similar to what is now 
contained in the national consensus standard ANSI/IWCA I 14.1 (OSHA, 1991a). These are:
 Training of employees in the use of the equipment before it is used.
 Inspection of the equipment each day before use.
 Proper rigging, including sound anchorages and tiebacks, in all cases, with 
particular emphasis on providing tiebacks when counterweights, cornice hooks, or 
similar non-permanent anchorage systems are used.
 Use of a separate fall arrest system.
 All lines installed (such as by using knots, swages, or eye splices) when rigging 
descent control devices shall be capable of sustaining a minimum tensile load of 
5,000 pounds.
 Provisions are made for rescue or assure that employees are able to rescue 
themselves.
 Ropes are effectively padded where they contact edges of the building, anchorage, 
obstructions, or other surfaces that might cut or weaken the rope.
 Provide for stabilization at the specific work location when descents are greater 
than 130 feet.
There are some changes in language but most of these are not anticipated to result in 
compliance costs, e.g., “prompt rescue” rather than “rescue” and “harness” rather than “body 
belt.” The exceptions are §1910.27(b)(2)(ii) and §1910.27(b)(2)(iv). According to 
3-34
§1910.27(b)(2)(ii), training must now be done in accordance with §1910.30. Costs for any 
training beyond what was done as a result of the 1991 memorandum are attributed to §1910.30.
§1910.27(b)(2)(iv). When rope descent systems are used, employers must use proper 
rigging, including sound anchorages and tiebacks with particular emphasis on providing tiebacks 
when counterweights, cornice hooks, or similar non-permanent anchorages are used. It is 
apparent that IWCA expects to find buildings without anchorages. A key provision of 
ANSI/IWCA I-14.1 is a written work plan (Section 1.7). The IWCA web site recommends that 
the person “whose job it is to look at and price jobs should be the primary person to develop the 
written plan. After all, this is the time when you see things like anchor points (or lack thereof) 
entrance ways, sharp edges, and other concerns. The best part of the written plan is the fact that it 
allows the building owner or manager to work with you in creating a safe place to work for you 
and your employees.” (IWCA, 2007b) ANSI/IWCA 14.1, Section 17 lists options for roof 
support equipment, including:
 Parapets, cornices, and building anchorages (Section 17.1)
 Davits and davit fixtures (a crane-like structure, Section 17.2)
 Sockets (Section 17.3)
 Tie-backs (Section 17.4)
 Counterweighted outriggers (Section 17.5)
 Parapet clamps and cornice hooks (Section 17.6)
 Overhead monorail tracks and trolleys (Section 17.7)
Several of these options, such as counterweighted outriggers, are transportable and are likely to 
be supplied by the contractor. Thus, the role of the work plan is to delineate how the work is to 
be performed using a mix of contractor and property owner equipment. The voluntary standard 
provides several acceptable options for roof support equipment and specifies the development of 
a work plan where both the contractor and property owner concur on how a safe job can be done 
at that property. It is highly unlikely that either party would agree to a work practice it 
3-35
considered unsafe and ERG believes that voluntary compliance with the consensus standard is 
likely to be high. Therefore, no costs are assigned for equipment costs.
Costs do result, however, from inspections and certification for providing assurances that 
an anchorage is sound. These are discussed in Section 3.3.5.
3.2.7.2 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.27(a). This paragraph extends the construction industry requirements for scaffolds 
(except rope descent systems) to all other parts of industry. The construction industry scaffold 
standards (Subpart L of 29 CFR Part 1926) were updated on August 30, 1996 (OSHA, 1996), 
and contain requirements for all the same types of scaffolds that are now regulated by General 
Industry standards. OSHA believes that many general industry employers who use scaffolds also 
perform work covered by the construction industry standards and are already familiar with, and 
in compliance with, the construction industry scaffold standards. Therefore, the new language 
resolves any inconsistencies and thus no costs are attributed to this paragraph.
§1910.27(b)(1). Rope descent systems are an alternative to powered platforms. The draft 
language states that rope descent systems cannot be used for heights greater than 300 feet unless 
access cannot otherwise be obtained safely and practicably. The wording of the draft rule is 
consistent with the industry consensus standard (ANSI/IWCA, 2001). In other words, both the 
IWCA consensus standard and the proposed OSHA language (1) prohibit the use of rope descent 
systems for descents exceeding 300 feet, and (2) contain an exclusion clause – unless access 
cannot safely and practicably be obtained by other means. Because both contain the same 
exclusion clause, the OSHA requirement is no more restrictive than the consensus standard. 
Since this is a work-practice as opposed to an equipment specification requirement, incremental 
costs are attributable to the proposed standard to the extent that employers would not otherwise 
voluntarily comply with the IWCA standard.
The potential cost is, at the very least, limited to situations where (1) the building is 300 
feet tall or higher, and (2) there is an alternative to the rope descent system that is practicable and 
safe. ERG used the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat’s database and identified 
slightly more than 1,900 buildings that are 300 feet (91.7 m) tall or higher (CTBUH, 2006). 
3-36
More than one in every four of these buildings is in New York City where State policy does not 
allow the use of rope descent systems (DiChacho, 2006). A better estimate of the number of 
potentially affected buildings is 1,500 buildings nationwide. ERG presumes that some of these 
1,500 buildings have permanently installed power platforms for access to the exterior of the 
building, and further presumes that using an existing system would be less expensive than setting 
up a rope descent system. The final set of buildings for which §1910.27(b)(1) could result in 
costs are those where a safe and practicable alternative to a rope descent system exists but cannot 
be used. Because all companies bidding on the project would be making those bids under the 
same set of constraints, §1910.27(b)(1) would not result in a loss in income to the window 
cleaning industry. There may be higher costs to the building owners but, although the cost cannot 
be estimated, ERG considers the cost to be small given the limited number of buildings that 
potentially would be affected.
§1910.27(b)(2)(x). The requirement to secure equipment is consistent with the consensus 
standard IWCA I-14.1-2001 Section 3.10. Thus, no incremental costs are incurred for this 
requirement.
§1910.27(b)(2)(xi). The requirement to protect suspension ropes from exposure to open 
flames, hot work, corrosive chemicals, or other destructive conditions is an extension of the 
requirement to protect the integrity of the ropes in the 1991 OSHA memorandum. The costs for 
meeting this requirement is part of the training costs estimated in §1910.30.
3.2.8 §1910.28 Duty to Have Fall Protection
The draft language for §1910.28, with two major revisions, is a consolidation of the fall 
protection requirements in the existing rule. First, comments submitted in response to the 
reopening of the rule in 2003 suggested that the fall protection requirements in Subpart D should 
be consistent with those in Subpart M of the construction standard. The draft language for 
§1910.28 brings consistency between the rules that might affect employers and employees in 
both the construction and General Industry sectors. Second, the existing standard does not 
address the use of restraint systems, designated areas, or safety nets systems, nor is it clear as to 
where the use of personal fall protection systems is permitted. The restructured section allows 
3-37
employers to choose from various options in providing fall protection, that is, it is not as 
restrictive as the existing standard that primarily requires the use of standard railings (guardrails).
3.2.8.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.28(a)(2). General. The employer must determine that the walking-working surface 
has the strength and structural integrity to safely support employees. Discussions with OSHA 
staff indicate that their opinion is that this requirement can be met by a five- to ten-minute 
inspection of the surface or review of engineering paperwork. In rare circumstances, an employer 
might need to spend 15 to 30 minutes to determine if work can proceed. Costs for this are 
discussed in Section 3.3.6 where they are considered as part of the general requirement for an 
employer to periodically and regularly inspect walking-working surfaces in §1910.22(d) (1).
§1910.28(b)(4). Dockboards. This includes a new requirement for guardrails or handrails 
on dockboards if an employee might fall four or more feet. There is an exception for cases where 
the dockboards are used exclusively for material handling operations performed with motorized 
equipment. In these cases, neither guardrails nor handrails are required if the fall hazard is 10
feet or less and the employee has been trained according to §1910.30. Section 3.3.6 discusses the 
costs for installing handrail or guardrail systems for dockboards. Training costs are assigned to 
§1910.30.
§1910.28(b)(10)(iii) and (vi). §1910.28(b)(10)(iii) requires the employee to follow 
inspection procedures for the safety devices. §1910.28(b)(10)(vi) requires the employee to have 
both hands free of tools and material while climbing up or down the ladder. No frequency is 
mentioned but we assume inspection occurs prior to each use. Costs are assigned to these two 
paragraphs and are discussed in Section 3.3.6.
§1910.28(b)(10)(v). This paragraph effectively requires employees that routinely climb 
fixed portions of billboard ladders that do not have cages or wells to be a “qualified” climber as 
specified in §1910.29(h). Costs for this paragraph are assigned to §1910.29(h). Rather than 
speculate on what defines “routinely”9 or what is required of employees that climb outdoor 
                                                
9 The draft text does not provide a definition of “routinely.”
3-38
advertising structures /billboards but not on a routine basis, ERG assumes that all employees in 
NAICS 5418 (advertising and related services) that use personal fall protection should be trained 
as qualified climbers (see §1910.29(h) discussion in Section 3.3.7).
3.2.8.2 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.28(b)(1). Unprotected sides and edges. Under the draft rule, if a walking-working 
surface (vertical and horizontal) has an unprotected side or edge that is four feet or more above a 
lower level, an employee must be protected from falling by the use of guardrail systems, safety 
net systems, personal fall arrest systems, or the employee must work in a designated area. In the 
existing rule, the “4-foot drop” condition for protection is found:
 §1910.23(b): every wall opening 
 §1910.23(c)(1): every open-sided floor or platform
 §1910.23(c)(2): the open sides of any runway
Thus, there is no change in height requirement for fall protection between the existing 
and draft rules. The language and organization for the draft rule, however, is less complex than 
that for the existing rule. The draft rule provides additional flexibility in the methods used for fall 
protection and allows for exceptional conditions, e.g., if it is not feasible to install guardrails on 
the working surface, guardrails are not required provided access to the working surface is limited 
to authorized employees who have been trained in accordance with §1910.30. No costs are 
assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(2). Hoist areas. The draft rule states that fall protection must be provided in 
hoist areas where the drop is four or more feet. This is a clarification. OSHA staff consider the 
existing §1910.23(b)(1) and §1910.23(c)(1) to address hoist areas. No costs are assigned to this 
paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(3). Holes. The existing rule requires guarding for every hole and skylight 
floor opening. The draft rule specifies that fall protection is needed when an employee might fall 
more than four feet. Thus, the new language brings the condition that precipitates a need for fall 
3-39
protection for holes into agreement with that for unprotected sides and edges and hoist areas. The 
new language also permits the requirement to be met by personal fall arrest systems and covers 
as well as guardrails. No costs are assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(6). Dangerous equipment. The existing language requires a standard railing 
and toe board for working/walking surfaces above dangerous equipment. The draft language 
introduces a distinction on what is required by whether the potential fall is less than four feet. For 
potential falls of less than four feet onto or into dangerous equipment, the employer has the 
additional options of covering or guarding the dangerous equipment to eliminate the hazard. For 
potential falls of four feet or more, the employer has the options of guardrail systems, restraint 
systems, personal fall arrest systems, or safety net systems. Because the employer is assumed to 
meet the requirements through the least cost method (see Section 3.1.7 above), no costs are 
assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(7). Wall openings. The draft language limits the need for fall protection to 
cases where the inside bottom edge of the wall opening is less than 39 inches above the walking-
working surface. In addition, the employer has the additional option of using a safety net system 
or personal fall arrest system to meet this requirement. No costs are assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(8). Repair, service, and assembly pits 4 to 10 feet in depth. Pits, in general, 
were subsumed within the definition of a floor opening in the existing §1910.21(a)(2). In the 
draft paragraph, pits between 4 and 10 feet in depth for repair, service, and assembly operations 
need not have a fall protection system provided that a (minimum) 6-foot perimeter is marked 
around the pit and access to that area is limited to trained and authorized employees. ERG does 
not assign incremental costs to this paragraph for two reasons. First, an employer would only 
incur costs for caution signs and floor markings if they were less expensive than the fall 
protection system required under the existing regulation (see Section 3.1.7 for a discussion on the 
assumption that an employer will meet requirements by the least expensive method). Second, the 
existing §1910.145 already requires an employer to post caution signs where needed and the 
existing §1910.144 describes what is required for marking. ERG assumes an employer has signs 
and marking materials available, so no incremental costs are assigned to this paragraph.
3-40
§1910.28(b)(9). Fixed ladders. The employer has the added option of meeting the 
requirement through the use of personal fall protection systems. The existing language specified 
cages or wells. No costs are assigned to this paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(10)(i), (ii), and (iv). Outdoor advertising (billboards). This is a new 
paragraph. Under the language of the existing Subpart D, no distinction is made for billboards. 
Thus, the fixed ladder portion of the billboard could be considered under the existing fixed 
ladder requirements. Under existing§1910.27(d)(1), cages or wells are required for ladders more 
than 20 feet. Under the draft §1910.28(b)(10)(i), an employee climbing a fixed ladder portion of 
a billboard up to 50 feet in length needs either a body belt or body harness with an appropriate 
18-inch rest lanyard as a means to tie off to the fixed ladder. Presumably, the additional options 
are less expensive than cages or wells where they do not already exist. Any ladder safety systems 
(i.e., a device other than a cage or well, see §1910.21(b)) that already exist must be maintained 
(§1910.28(b)(10)(iv)). This is already required under current practice. Thus, no incremental costs 
are assigned to these paragraphs for compliance.
If, however, the fixed ladder portion extends beyond 50 feet, the entire length of the fixed 
ladder must have ladder safety devices (see §1910.28(b)(10)(ii)). Ladder safety systems refer to 
any device other than a cage or well (Presumably, the ladder safety systems are less expensive 
than cages or wells where the latter do not already exist, see Section 3.1.7). Thus, no incremental 
costs are assigned to this paragraph for compliance.
§1910.28(b)(10)(vii). Climbers must be protected by an appropriate fall protection 
system when they reach their work positions but the costs for these systems are already 
considered in the existing requirements for fixed ladder systems. Thus, no additional costs for 
equipment are considered for this paragraph.
§1910.28(b)(12). Scaffolds and rope descent systems. Paragraph now refers to §1926, 
thus avoiding any inconsistencies between the paragraphs. The language extends the 
requirements found in the construction standards to all other industries. Fall protection on 
scaffolds in §1926 follows consensus standards, thus no costs are assigned to this paragraph.
3-41
§1910.28(b)(13). Walking-working surfaces not otherwise addressed. OSHA considers 
the new paragraph to be a clarification of the existing §1910.23(c)(3), which requires a railing 
and toeboard. The draft language restricts the requirement to working surfaces 4 feet or more 
above a lower level and permits the employer to comply with the paragraph by the use a personal 
fall protection system. Under the least cost assumption, no costs are assigned to this paragraph.
3.2.9 §1910.29 Fall Protection Systems and Criteria
3.2.9.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.29(b)(15). Guardrail systems. The new paragraph requires that manila, plastic, or 
synthetic rope being used for top rails or midrails be inspected “as frequently as necessary” to 
ensure that it meets the strength requirements. This inspection cost is considered in Section 3.3.7.
§1910.29(h). This paragraph sets the criteria for the use of “qualified” climbers10 and 
limits the use of “qualified climbers” to employees engaged in outdoor advertising operations. 
The costs for this paragraph are those to train and, as necessary, retrain qualified climbers. That 
is, ERG assumes qualified climbers require training beyond that now required for fixed ladders. 
Additional costs are incurred by the requirement for the employer to observe the performance to 
ensure the qualified climber has the skills necessary to perform the climb safely. These costs are 
discussed further in Section 3.3.7. 
3.2.9.2 Paragraphs with No Costs
§1910.29(c). Safety net systems. Paragraph now refers to §1926, thus avoiding any 
inconsistencies between the paragraphs. The language extends the requirements found in the 
construction standards to all other industries. However, safety net system requirements in §1926 
follow consensus standards, thus no costs are assigned to this paragraph.
                                                
10 A “qualified climber” as described here combines the terms “qualified engineer” and “qualified person” in ANSI 
standard A10.14 on fall protection. That standard, however, has been withdrawn.
3-42
3.2.10 §1910.30 Training Programs
3.2.10.1 Paragraphs with Costs
This is an entirely new paragraph requiring training regarding fall and equipment hazards 
as well as re-training when necessary for employees in general industry. ERG assumes that an 
employer that trains employees in compliance with §1910.30 would choose to maintain records 
of the training and the cost estimates reflect this time commitment on the part of the employer. 
The training costs estimated for §1910.30 encompass requirements from other paragraphs that 
specify that training must be done in accordance with §1910.30. These costs are discussed in 
more detail in Section 3.3.8 and are incurred only by the percentage of establishments that do not 
already provide regular safety training.
3.2.11 §1910.140 Subpart I: Fall Protection
OSHA proposes to amend the general industry standard for personal protective 
equipment (PPE) to add requirements for personal fall protection equipment. The draft 
§1910.140 adds specific design and performance requirements for personal fall protection 
systems to the existing regulation. In addition, the proposed standard would require that the 
provisions for hazard assessment found in §1910.132 apply to personal fall protection systems.
3.2.11.1 Paragraphs with Costs
§1910.140(c)(18) requires personal fall protection systems to be inspected prior to each 
use.  Inspection costs for this provision are discussed in Section 3.3.9.
§1910.132(d) requires an employer to assess the workplace to determine if hazards are 
present, or are likely to be present, which necessitate the use of PPE and, if so, to determine the 
type of PPE required. Costs associated with hazard assessment are discussed in Section 3.3.9.
§1910.132(f) requires that— before using personal fall protection systems, and after any 
component or system is changed— employees must be trained in the application limits of the 
3-43
equipment, proper hook-up, anchoring and tie-off techniques, methods of use, and proper 
methods of equipment inspection and storage. The costs for this paragraph, then, are included in 
the costs for §1910.30.
3.3 COST ESTIMATION
This section focuses on the costs associated with the draft rule. It does not attempt to 
estimate potential cost savings to industry from increased flexibility in meeting specific 
requirements, such as the use of personal fall protection systems rather than the currently 
mandated hand/guardrail systems, even if some of the new alternatives might actually be safer 
than the currently mandated requirements.11
Section 3.3.1 discusses data used in the following estimations. Section 3.3.2 through 
3.3.9 estimates the costs associated with each paragraph. Table 3-4, developed in Section 3.4, is 
the basis for these discussion. Section 3.3 summarizes the compliance cost estimates for the draft 
standards.
3.3.1 Supporting Data
The costs are based on additional employer and supervisor time for training and 
inspection. The number of establishments and employees are taken from Statistics of U.S. 
Businesses 2003. The number of employees covered by Subpart D and Subpart I is based on the 
employment share of workers employed in building and grounds; construction12; installation, 
maintenance, and repair; production; and material moving occupations as reported by Bureau of 
Labor statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics. See Section Two for more industry profile 
information.
                                                
11 The new alternatives are assumed to be at least as effective in employee protection as that provided by the current 
requirements.
12 Production workers include those in building and grounds; construction; installation, maintenance, and repair; 
production; and material moving occupations. It is conceivable that workers in construction and related occupations, 
even though not employed by establishments in construction industries, might on occasion perform work that would 
be regulated by OSHA under its construction standards in §1926. For the purpose of estimating costs, however, 
ERG assumed that these employees are covered by the General Industry standard.
3-44
Employee and supervisor wages (See Table 2-5) also are based on Bureau of Labor 
statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics. Wages are adjusted to include the cost of 
benefits, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics, Employer Costs for Employee Compensation –
March 2006 (released June 2006). Current compliance rates are based on OSHA inspection 
statistics for Fiscal Year 2005, see Table 3-3. The percentage of businesses that already provide 
regular safety training is based on the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NIOSH, 1988), 
see Table 3-6.

3.3.2 §1910.22 General Requirements
§1910.22(d). Although the underlying hazard of unsafe walking-working surfaces is 
addressed within various §1910 requirements, §1910.22 contains three paragraphs with new 
requirements:
• §1910.22(d)(1): Regular and periodic inspection of walking-working surfaces
• §1910.22(d)(2): Unsafe conditions must be guarded until repair
• §1910.22(d)(3): Qualified person must inspect repair.
For the purpose of estimating costs for §1910.22(d)(1), ERG assumes that facilities in 
compliance with OSHA regulations already perform regular and periodic inspections of walking 
working surfaces. For the purposes of estimating costs, ERG used the non-compliance rates for 
floor guarding (§1910.23 has the highest non-compliance rates, see Table 3-3) to estimate the 
number of establishments that need to perform regular and periodic inspections of walking-
working surfaces. ERG assumed that a supervisor would spend 15 minutes every quarter making 
the inspection for a total of 1 hour per year. The total annual cost for inspections is estimated to 
be $12.9 million.
For estimating the costs for §1910.22(d)(2), ERG assumed that within a year, ten percent 
of these establishments would identify an unsafe condition and that it takes an employee 15 
minutes to set up the guard mechanism (e.g., cones, barriers, etc.). Incremental material costs are 
assumed to be negligible (e.g., they have cones but now they use them). Estimated compliance
costs for this provision are $0.196 million.
For §1910.22(d)(3), ERG assumes it takes 5 minutes for a supervisor or qualified person 
to inspect the repair of the unsafe condition. The estimated cost is $0.107 million ($107,350).
The total estimated cost for compliance with §1910.22(d) is $13.2 million per year.
3-46
3.3.3 §1910.23 Ladders
§1910.23(b)(11-13), §1910.23(c)(5-6), (10-11), and (13). Eight paragraphs within 
§1910.23 have new directives for protecting employees from slip, trip, and fall hazards during 
operations involving ladders. Table 3-7 summarizes these requirements, all of which are assumed 
to be addressed in a single training session. ERG considers that compliance with this paragraph 
can be met by informal training and thus no administrative costs are included for an employer.
The OSHA website includes a Resource Center with a loan program for training videos 
(OSHA, 2006d). The index lists ten training videos for ladders and stairways with times ranging 
from five to 19 minutes and an average of 12 minutes. For the purposes of estimating costs, we 
use a 15-minute training period. Ten employees are trained per session with one supervisor in 
attendance. We assume that $1 in materials cost is incurred for handouts for each employee 
trained.
Table 3-7. Training Requirements Under Draft §1910.23
Paragraph Subject
§1910.23(b)(11) When ascending or descending a ladder, the user must face the ladder.
§1910.23(b)(12) Each employee must use at least one hand to grasp the ladder when 
progressing up and down the ladder.
§1910.23(b)(13) An employee must not carry any object or load that could cause the 
employee to lose his or her balance and fall.
§1910.23(c)(5) The use of portable single rail ladders is prohibited.
§1910.23(c)(6) Ladders must not be moved, shifted, or extended while occupied by 
employees.
§1910.23(c)(10) The top of a non-self-supporting ladder must be placed with the two rails 
supported unless it is equipped with a single support attachment. (New for 
wood ladders)
§1910.23(c)(11) When portable ladders are used to gain access to an upper landing surface, 
the ladder siderails must extend at least 3 feet (0.9 m) above that upper 
landing surface. (New for metal ladders)
§1910.23(c)(13) Ladders and ladder sections must not be tied or fastened together to provide 
longer length unless they are specifically designed for such use. (New for 
wood ladders)
Some establishments already provide regular safety training. The proportions of 
industries that already provide training are taken from NOES survey. Although the data are more 
than 20 years old, NIOSH (1988) is still the primary source for such information covering a 
3-47
range of industries. The proportion of establishments that already offer regular safety training is 
likely to have increased in the past two decades, hence, the training costs may be overestimated.
The cost to train all the employees at establishments that do not offer regular safety 
training is a one-time cost that is annualized over a 10-year period at an interest rate of seven 
percent to estimate the cost of the rule. The total costs are $10.1 million with an annualized cost 
of $1.4 million.
New employees that enter the workforce would also need training. For the purpose of 
estimating the cost of the rule, ERG assumed that training received at a prior place of 
employment was not considered sufficient to meet this requirement for the new employer. ERG 
examined the industry turnover rate data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For 2002, 
the data were collected by SIC code while industries in this cost analysis are classified by 
NAICS code. Table 3-8 summarizes the data and the NAICS codes to which they are assigned. 
ERG assigned the turnover rate for manufacturing to logging (NAICS 1133) and oil and gas 
extraction (NAICS 2111). ERG assigned the turnover rate for finance, insurance, and real estate 
to information (NAICS 51). Under these assumptions, the estimated cost is $3.9 million per year 
to train new employees about ladder safety.

§1910.23(e). The industry profile identifies 6,460,256 establishments covered in Subpart 
D. Five years might be a typical lifetime for a ladder; thus ERG assumes that one-fifth of the 
establishments might purchase a ladder in any given year. Furthermore, ERG assumes that a 
supervisor from each establishment takes 5 minutes to read ladder specifications to ensure the 
3-48
ladder about to be purchased meets all ANSI 14 requirements for that type ladder. With these 
assumptions, the estimated annual cost for this paragraph is $3.2 million.
3.3.4 §1910.24 Step Bolts and Manhole Steps
§1910.24(a)(8). ERG identified three general cost categories for the step bolt and pole 
step requirements:
 Utility poles.
 Communication structures
 Sports and performance arenas with pole-mounted lights
Utility poles have been identified as having step bolts. According to the 2007 UDI 
Directory of Electric Power Producers and Distributors, there are 6,297,596 distribution line 
miles across the United States (Platts, 2007). Of these we are interested in the overhead (as 
opposed to underground) line miles. The most recent data found for the overhead line miles is 
4.1 million line miles in 1996, about two-thirds of total line miles (NCAMP, 1997). Considering 
the maturity of the electric power industry in the United States, it is assumed that there is not a 
significant amount of new line miles built, and of the new lines miles there is a trend to build the 
lines underground. Assuming one pole every 100 feet, ERG estimates 216,480,000 poles across 
the United States. This is 2.5 times the number of reported utility poles on highways in 1999, and 
therefore this estimate is considered reasonable (NCHRP, 2004). Assuming 1 percent of the 
poles are climbed each year and 1 minute is taken for inspection of the step bolts, the estimated 
annual cost is $1.3 million.
ERG estimated about 190,000 fixed ladder structures in the communications industry (see 
Appendix A). This estimate, however, actually covers communication structures with fixed 
ladders and step bolts. Fixed ladders, however, have an existing requirement for inspection while 
step bolts do not. Structures in FCC's Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) database meet at 
least one of the following requirements:
 Height is 200 ft or greater.
3-49
 Height <199 ft IF within 5 miles of an airport and fails the glide calculation (Part 
17 requirement).
 Height of the extension (e.g., beyond the building roof) is 20 feet or more.
ERG assumes that these structures are more likely to have fixed ladders rather than step 
bolts. As of May 2007, there are approximately 93,000 structures in the ASR database. 
Communication structures that are not in the ASR database are smaller and, thus, more likely to 
have step bolts. ERG assumes that the difference between the total number of structures 
(190,000) and the number in the ASR database (93,000) is the number of structures that could 
potentially have step bolts. ERG assumes that the 97,000 structures with step bolts are climbed 
once a year and that one minute is spent inspecting the structure before it is climbed. This results 
in an annual cost of $0.039 million for NAICS 51 (Information).
There are 1,699 promoters of performing arts, sports, and similar events with facilities 
(Census, 2002). ERG is unable to estimate the number of step bolts at each facility, but assumes 
that one hour per year is dedicated to inspecting all step bolts at each facility. This results in an 
annual cost of $0.028 million for NAICS 7113 (promoters of performing arts, sports, and similar 
events with facilities).
The total annual inspection cost for step bolts is estimated to be $1.37 million.
§1910.24(b)(3). ERG (2005) estimates there are between 6.6 and 13.2 million manholes 
with a mid-point estimate of 9.9 million. Of these, approximately 85 percent, or 8.4 million are 
less than 20 feet in depth and do not have a fixed ladder. ERG assumes that 10 percent of these 
are entered once a year, on average, and that it takes one minute to inspect the steps prior to 
entering the manhole. This results in an annual cost of $0.34 million for NAICS 2213 (water, 
sewage, and other systems).
Other industries also use manholes for access, such as the electric power generation, 
transmission, and distribution (NAICS 2211) and natural gas distribution (NAICS 2212). ERG, 
however, has no data on the number of such manholes but assumes that the costs would be 
proportional to the number of manholes that are estimated for water and sewage systems. No 
costs are estimated for NAICS 2211 and 2212 for this paragraph.
3-50
§1910.24(b)(2) and (4) The incremental costs of slip-resistant and corrosion-resistant 
surfaces would be incurred in the future as manhole sections with steps are replaced at the end of 
their useful life. There are 9.9 million manholes, of which 85 percent are less than 20 feet and 15 
percent are 20 feet or more. The manholes less than 20 feet are assumed to have a uniform 
distribution between portable ladders, fixed ladders, and steps, resulting in 2.9 million manholes 
with steps. The manholes 20 feet or more are assumed to have a uniform distribution between 
fixed ladders and steps, resulting in 0.7 million manholes with steps. Therefore, 3.6 million 
manholes are considered as the universe affected by the proposed language. The most expensive 
step found has a per-unit cost of $8.50, and it is assumed that this includes a 10 percent premium 
to ensure the steps meet the proposed requirements.
First, annual step replacement costs are estimated assuming that 10 percent of the 
manholes are entered each year, and of those 10 percent have a failed rung. At the incremental 
cost of $0.85 each, the estimated annual step replacement cost is $0.03 million. Second, annual 
manhole replacement costs are estimated assuming 5 percent of manholes need to be replaced a 
year and that steps are every 16 inches. The estimated annual manhole replacement cost is $1.7 
million.
3.3.5 §1910.27 Scaffolds and Rope Descent Systems
§1910.27(b)(2)(ii). Cost for any training beyond what is done as a result of the 1991 
memorandum are attributed to §1910.30 (see Section 3.3.8).
§1910.27(b)(2)(iv). To provide assurances that an anchorage is sound, costs are assigned 
as 1) a qualified/competent person to inspect the rigging and anchorages on buildings annually 
and 2) a professional engineer to certify the soundness of the rigging and anchorages every 10 
years.
ERG contacted Stefan Bright of the International Window Cleaning Association who 
provided an estimate of 3.0 million descents or 750,000 buildings per year (Bright, 2007). Using 
data collected by the Department of Energy (DOE) for surveys on energy use, ERG compared 
this estimate with the number of commercial and residential buildings with four or more floors. 
The 2003 Commercials Buildings Energy Consumption Survey identified about 140,000 
3-51
commercial buildings nationwide (DOE, 2006). The 2001 Residential Energy Consumption 
Survey identified about 2.4 million apartment buildings with 5 to 10 floors, 0.9 million 
apartment buildings with 11 to 20 floors, and an unspecified number of buildings with more than 
20 floors. Thus, we have at least 3.3 million residential buildings with at least 5 or more floors 
(DOE, 2004).
If we assume that each commercial building has its windows cleaned annually, that 
would account for 140,000 of the estimated 750,000 cleanings per year. If the remaining 610,000 
cleanings are distributed over the 3.3 million residential buildings, each building would, on 
average, have its windows cleaned every five to six years.13
Bright (2007) estimated that a minimum of 20 percent of the building owners comply 
with the inspection standard but that the number is increasing. Comments on the proposed 
language, however, indicate a wide range of response that probably reflect the geographical 
variability in proportion of building owners that inspect their anchorages on a periodic basis. 
Amodeo (2003) mentions some clients view ANSI I-14 as voluntary and resist having 
inspections. Kreidenweis (2003) mentions that very few buildings are inspected by an engineer. 
In contrast, Lebel (2003) mentions that many buildings have a roof plan and identified 
anchorages certified by a professional engineer. Zeolla (2003) states that most buildings that 
have invested in anchors are performing the inspections. 
If we assume approximately 750,000 inspections per year and 75 percent of them will be 
affected by the change from a voluntary requirement to a mandatory requirement, an estimated 
562,500 buildings require annual inspections and decennial certifications.
It is assumed that the annual inspections are performed by a supervisor and that it takes 
one hour to perform the inspection.
Table 3-9 summarizes the range in costs estimated for a professional engineer to certify 
the anchorages. Kreidenweis (2003) and Lebel (2003) are comments submitted to OSHA on 
proposed Subpart D language. The estimates are deflated to 2003 dollars based on changes in the 
                                                
13 In an unscientific sample, a 25-year resident of a 28-story apartment building in New York City reported that the 
outside of the windows were never cleaned (Smith, 2007).
3-52
Consumer Price Index (CPI-U; CEA, 2007). The costs range from a low of $175 to a high of 
$2,500 and probably represent the range in building size, complexity, and regional variation. The 
median value is $1,000.
Table 3-9. Estimated Certification Costs
2003 Dollars
Estimated Cost Estimated Cost

Lebel, 2003 $175 $1,000 2003 $175 $1,000
Wright, 2003 $400 2003 $400
An estimated 562,500 inspections at an inspection cost of $21.97/hr14 is about $12.4 
million. An estimated 562,500 certifications every ten years means that 56,250 buildings need to 
certify every year. At an average cost of $1,000 for certification this is about $56.3 million. The 
estimated total cost of inspecting and certifying anchorages for window washing is $68.6 
million.
3.3.6 §1910.28 Duty to Have Fall Protection
§1910.28(a)(2). This paragraph covers all walking-working surfaces. The paragraph on 
general requirements (§1910.22(d)(1)) has a provision for the employer to inspect walking-
working surfaces on a periodic and regular basis to ensure that the surfaces are in a safe 
condition for the employee to use. ERG considers §1910.28(a)(2) to provide further detail as to 
what should be considered in an inspection. Thus, ERG considers the costs for strength and 
structural integrity inspection, specified in §1910.28(a)(2), to be included in the costs estimated 
for general inspection in §1910.22(d)(1). The costs for §1910.22(d)(1) are discussed in Section 
3.3.2.
§1920.28(b)(4) concerns dockboards. In this paragraph, guardrails or handrails must be 
installed if an employee can fall four or more feet to a lower level. Dockboards with maximum 
                                                
14 See production worker supervisor’s hourly wage plus benefits for NAICS 5617 in Table 2-5.
3-53
heights of less than four feet would not incur costs under this paragraph. Dockboards with fall 
potential between four feet and ten feet are exempted from the hand/guardrail requirement if the 
ramp is used exclusively for material handling operations with motorized equipment. To qualify 
for the exception, employees must be trained and these requirements are discussed in Section 
3.3.8 below. ERG assumes that a substantial proportion of dockboards would either not incur 
costs due to height or be able to use the exception, thus the costs that would be incurred under 
this paragraph are unlikely to be substantial and are not estimated.
The costs for §1920.28(b)(4)(ii)(B) are included in the estimates for §1910.30 (see 
Section 3.3.8).
§1910.28(b)(10)(iii). ERG (2005) reports that, based on discussions with the Outdoor 
Advertising Association of America, the number of billboards with fixed ladders over 20 feet is 
approximately 20,500. The billboards are climbed anywhere from one to more than 12 times a 
year whenever the copy is changed. For the purpose of estimating costs, ERG assumes that the 
20,500 billboards are climbed six times a year (123,000 climbs). Each time a billboard is about 
to be climbed, the employee takes two minutes to inspect the ladder safety device (246,000 
minutes or 4,100 hours). Employees that climb billboards are included under NAICS 5418 
(Advertising and Related Services). In 2003, the average wage including benefits for this 
category is $18.895/hr. The estimated cost to comply with this provision is approximately 
$77,469 per year.
§1910.28(b)(10)(v) and (vi) refers to outdoor advertising operations. For the purpose of 
estimating costs, all employees that climb billboard are assumed to be “qualified” climbers and 
that the training for a qualified climber includes the instruction to have both hands free while 
ascending or descending the ladder (§1910.28(b)(10)(vi)). ERG assigns the costs to train a 
qualified climber (§1910.28(b)(10)(v)) to §1910.29(h).
3.3.7 §1910.29 Fall Protection Systems Criteria and Practices
§1910.29(b)(15). The draft language for §1910.29(b)(15) specifies only that the 
inspections must be done as frequently as necessary to ensure the strength requirement is met. 
The estimated inspection cost, then, would be the product of the:
3-54
 number of guardrail systems 
 proportion that use manila, plastic, or synthetic rope used as toprails or midrails
 number of inspections per year
 time required for each inspection (hr)
 average wage per inspector per industry ($/hr).
At this time, ERG does not have an estimate of the proportion of guardrail systems that 
use manila, plastic, or synthetic rope as top rails or midrails. However, ERG considers it likely 
that the inspection of these alternate materials for toprails and siderails would form part of the 
inspections performed under §1910.22, the general inspection of walking-working surfaces for 
safety. That is, §1910.29(b)(15) provides a detail to be included in the inspection for those 
workplaces that use manila, plastic, or synthetic rope as top rails or midrails. Therefore, no 
additional costs are allocated to this provision.
§1910.29(h). Qualified climbers must:
 have climbing duties as one of their routine work activities (§1910.29(h)(4))
 be physically capable of performing the climbing duties (§1910.29(h)(1))
 undergo training or an apprenticeship program (§1910.29(h)(2))
 be retrained as necessary (§1910.29(h)(2))
Employers are required to ensure that a qualified climber has the skill to safely perform 
the climb. The language for how the employer does this is open to two interpretations. The first 
interpretation is that the employer uses performance observations (i.e., in all cases) and either 
formal classroom or on-the-job training. The second interpretation is that the employer uses 
performance observations when the climber has had formal classroom training, or the employer 
ensures the skill of the qualified climber through on-the-job training. In the second case, the 
employer does not need to personally observe the climber.
3-55
The concept of a “qualified climber” is not new. In 1990, Gannett Outdoor Companies 
applied for a variance from the fixed ladder regulations. OSHA considered the application and 
granted it in 1991. In 1993, OSHA issued an instruction to extend the variance granted to 
Gannett Outdoor Companies to other employers (OSHA, 1990, OSHA, 1991b, and OSHA, 
1993). For the purposes of estimating costs, ERG assumes that 90 percent of the employees in 
the outdoor advertising industry that climb have been trained as qualified climbers. Thus, there 
are one-time costs associated with this paragraph to qualify the remaining 10 percent of climbers. 
These costs are annualized over 10 years at a rate of seven percent. In addition, the industry 
incurs annual costs for:
 Employer performance observation
 Training of new employees
 Retraining of employees as necessary
 Administrative costs to document training and re-training.
For the purpose of estimating one-time costs, ERG assumes that 818 employees that 
perform construction, installation, maintenance, and repair operations in NAICS 5418 
(advertising and related services) need to undergo training to be qualified climbers. 
The National Association of Tower Erectors has developed a climber training standard 
with varying levels of expertise (authorized, competent, and competent rescuer) but does not 
offer training itself (NATE, 2006). The OSHA website lists a 4-day training session in fall arrest 
systems for $750. Commercial courses in fall protection searched on the web range from one to 
five days with costs ranging from $500 to $2,500 per course. The prices include materials and 
the trainer’s time. For the purposes of estimating costs, ERG assumes a 4-day training at a cost 
of $1,500 plus the employee’s time ($605, based on an average wage of $18.89/hr and 32 hours) 
for a total of $2,105. Administrative tasks to document the training are assumed to be 15 minutes 
of a supervisor’s time for every ten employees trained. The one-time cost to qualify the estimated 
818 climbers of outdoor advertising/billboard structure is $1.72 million and the annualized cost 
is $0.25 million per year.
3-56
For the purposes of estimating the annual costs associated with this paragraph, ERG 
assumes:
 A supervisor observes each of the estimated 8,180 qualified climbers for 15 
minutes per quarter or 1 hour per qualified climber per year. 
 A supervisor spends 15 minutes per year per qualified climber on administrative 
tasks for training and re-training.
 Ten percent of the climbers need re-training.
 Retraining consists of an 8-hour refresher course at a cost of $500.
 The turnover rate is 43 percent.
The estimated annual cost is $8.2 million of which $7.4 million is due to the need to train 
new hires.15
3.3.8 §1910.30 Training Programs
§1910.30(a and b) addresses training with respect to fall hazards. The training must be:
 done by a qualified person
 include the nature of fall hazards in the workplace
 include the correct procedures for erecting, maintaining, disassembling, and 
inspecting the fall protection system used
 include the use and operation of guardrail systems, safety net systems, warning 
lines used in designated areas, and other (unspecified) protection to be used
                                                
15 This assumes that a qualified climber could not bring his or her accreditation if he or she changes companies.
3-57
 The use, operation, and limitations of personal fall protection systems including 
proper hook-up, anchoring and tie-off techniques, methods of use, and proper 
methods of equipment inspection and storage as recommended by the 
manufacturer.
§1910.30(b) addresses training with respect to equipment hazards. In particular, 
employees must be trained in the proper:
 care, use, and inspection of equipment covered by the subpart D and their use in 
accordance with recognized industry practices and manufacturers 
recommendations
 placement and securing of dockboards to prevent unintentional movement
 rigging and safe use of rope descent systems.
The costs for the training allocated under §1910.27(b)(2)(ii) (rope descent systems) and 
§1910.28(b)(4) (duty to have fall protection: dockboards) are thus included in the cost estimate 
for §1910.30. 
ERG estimated the number and percent of employees by industry that use personal 
protective equipment such as body belts and/or body harnesses (ERG, 1999). ERG then applied 
these industry-specific percentages to the number of employees for 2003 to estimate the number 
of employees that need the type of training now required in §1910.30.
Some companies already provide this training. ERG used the NOES survey to estimate 
the level of training, by NAICS code, that is already provided at the baseline. 
For the purpose of estimating costs, ERG assumes that all employees that have not 
already been trained and use personal fall protection systems undergo a 6-hour training on fall 
hazards to address the §1910.30(a) and 1910.30(b)(1) requirements. 
Employees in the utility, sewage, and communications industry sectors (NAICS 2211-
2213 and 5121-5191) are assumed to undergo an additional half-day of training to specifically 
3-58
address the requirements for step bolts (i.e., a total of 10 hours of training). Employees in NAICS 
codes 4881 thorough 4884 (support activities for transportation by air, rail, water, and road, 
respectively) are assumed to undergo a half-day of training specifically to address requirements 
for dockboards. Window washers are in NAICS 5617 (services to buildings and dwellings). They 
are assumed to have an entire day devoted to training on rope descent systems (i.e., for a total of 
14 hours). 
Training must be provided by a qualified person. For the purpose of estimating costs, 
ERG assumes that the trainer comes to the workplace. The $500/day fee includes instruction, 
travel, lodging, and per diem as well as hand-out materials. This fee is incurred per every 10 
employees (i.e., class size is limited to 10 people). 
A supervisor is assumed to spend 15 minutes per employee per year in administrative 
costs to maintain and update training records. 
The estimated total one-time cost for §1910.30(a and b) is $76.8 million. This cost is 
annualized over ten years and an interest rate of seven percent. The annualized cost is $10.9 
million.
There is also an annual cost due to the need to train new employees. The BLS turnover 
rates are applied to estimate the annual number of new employees that need training. The 
estimated annual cost is $26.6 million.
§1910.30(c) concerns the need to retrain employees whenever the employer has reason to 
believe that retraining is required for safety. This need can occur through several situations such 
as changes in the workplace, fall protection systems, or fall protection equipment that render 
previous training invalid, or employee knowledge or use of fall protection systems or equipment 
is not adequate. ERG assumes that retraining already occurs at establishments that already have 
training programs in place. For the remaining employees, ERG estimates that five percent 
require retraining in any given year. The retraining course is assumed to be a 1-hour refresher 
course provided by a supervisor that focuses on the areas in which the employee is deficient. The 
estimated cost is $3.9 million.
3-59
3.3.9 §1910.140 Subpart I: Fall Protection
§1910.140(c)(18) states that personal fall protection systems must be inspected before 
each use for mildew, wear, damage, and other deterioration and defective components must be 
removed from service. For the purposes of estimating costs, ERG assumes that each employee 
that wears a personal fall protection system does so at the beginning of every workweek, the 
employee works 50 weeks per year, and the inspection takes about one minute. The associated 
inspection cost is approximately $6.5 million per year.
§1910.132(d) requires an employer to assess the workplace to determine if hazards are 
present or are likely to be present.  ERG assumes that the amount of time needed by an employer 
to walk around the establishment, assess the potential hazard, and determine the appropriate PPE 
and training needed by the employees varied with the size of the establishment. ERG uses the 
number of employees as an indicator of establishment size. The time required for the hazard 
assessment is estimated as:
 1 to 19 employees: 1 hour
 20 to 99 employees: 2 hours
 100 to 499 employees: 3 hours
 500+ employees: 4 hours.
Furthermore, ERG assumed that:
 All establishments in the forestry, oil and gas, utility, manufacturing, and transportation 
sectors (NAICS 1131 through 3399 and 4811 through 4931) required a hazard 
assessment. 
 Half the establishments in wholesale and retail sales (NAICS 4231 through 4543 required 
a hazard assessment, and 
 One-quarter of the establishments in the service industries (NAICS 5111 through 8139) 
required a hazard assessment.
3-60
This results in a one-time cost of $61.4 million, which converts to an annualized cost of $8.7 
million.
1910.132(f) requires that employees must be trained prior to using PPE in the workplace. 
The costs for this paragraph, then, are included in the costs for §1910.30.
3.4 COST SUMMARY
Tables 3-10 through 3-12 summarize the cost for each paragraph by industry. Table 3-10 
lists the first-year costs. These costs are incurred once in order to bring the employee population 
into compliance with the new requirements. For the purpose of evaluating impacts, these one-
time costs are annualized over a 10-year period at an interest rate of 7 percent. Total first-year 
costs are $150 million; the annualized cost is $21.4 million
Table 3-11 lists the recurring costs, such as inspections and training new employees, for 
each paragraph by industry. These costs are incurred annually and are estimated at $138 million. 
Table 3-12 lists the annual costs to industry, that is, the sum of the recurring costs and the 
annualized one-time costs. The cost to industry is estimated at $159 million.

SECTION FOUR
4. BENEFITS
OSHA’s draft standards for Subpart D, Walking and Working Surfaces, and Subpart I, 
Fall Protection, will produce benefits to the extent compliance with the standard results in the 
aversion of injuries and fatalities that would not otherwise be prevented through full compliance
with the existing OSHA standards. Section 4.1 presents a profile of fall injuries and fatalities that 
might potentially be preventable by the OSHA standards, while Section 4.2 presents estimates of 
the annual numbers of injuries and fatalities preventable through compliance with the draft 
standard, but not otherwise preventable under the existing standard.
4.1 PROFILE OF FALL ACCIDENTS
4.1.1 Fall Fatalities
As shown in Table 4-1, the BLS’s Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) reported 
287 and 312 fatal falls for 2003 and 2004, respectively, in the industries covered by the draft 
standard. Over the two-year period, industries in the Professional and Business Services sector 
(NAICS 54, 55, and 56) accounted for 26.2 percent of the fatal falls, while the Manufacturing 
and Transportation sectors accounted for 15.3 and 10.1 percent of the fall fatalities, respectively. 
BLS reported the highest number of fatal falls in NAICS 561, Administrative and Support 
Services. Although not shown in the table, a large majority of these fatalities occurred in the 
landscaping services industry (NAICS 561720). The CFOI reported 47 and 44 fatal falls for this 
industry in 2003 and 2004, respectively. The fatality numbers reported in Table 4-1 also include 
18 and 27 fatalities for 2003 and 2004, respectively, resulting from “falls from ship.” These 
accidents are otherwise classified as transportation accidents.

4-4
Table 4-2 shows, for the eleven-year period 1992 to 2002, the breakdown of fall fatalities 
by type of fall. As shown, falls to a lower level (as opposed to falls on the same level) accounted 
for about 78 percent of the fatalities. On an overall average basis, falls to a lower level, 
accounted for 217 of the 279 fatal falls per year that occurred in general industry establishments. 
On a sector-by-sector basis, falls to a lower level as a percent of all fatal falls ranged from 59 and 
71 percent for the Retail Trade and Services sectors, respectively, to 95 percent for the 
Agricultural Services sector. As the table also shows fatal falls from ladders averaged 41 per year 
over the ten-year period, while falls from scaffolds averaged 15 per year. Although not shown in 
this table, the category of “other” falls to a lower level includes the following types of falls: fall 
from floor, dock, or ground level; fall from nonmoving vehicle; fall from building girders or 
other structural steel; and fall to lower level, n.e.c.
4.1.2 Fall Injuries
Table 4-3 shows on a 3-digit NAICS basis, the lost-workday injury rate for the two major 
categories of falls: falls to a lower lever and falls to the same level. For those 3-digit industries 
where the BLS reported statistics, the combined fall injury rate ranges from a low of 4.9 cases 
per 10,000 workers in NAICS 523 (Securities, Commodity Contracts, and Other Financial 
Investments and Related Activities) to a high of 81.9 per 10,000 workers in NAICS 484 (Truck 
Transportation). Twenty-five industries had fall injury rates in excess of 30.0 cases per 10,000 
workers, while 19 had fall injury rates between 20.0 and 30.0 cases per 10,000 workers.
Table 4-4 shows lost workday fall-related injury rates by detailed type of fall, 
disaggregated by major industry sector covered by the draft standard. These statistics show that, 
unlike fall fatalities, falls to a lower level represent a relatively small share of non-fatal falls. For 
example, in manufacturing, falls to the same level account for 67 percent of all falls, while falls 
to a lower level accounted for only 28 percent. For service providing industries, falls to the same 
level account for 71 percent of all falls. The majority of accidents in this are characterized as a 
fall to a floor, walkway, or other surface.

Among falls accidents addressed by the OSHA draft standard, the annual risk of a fall to 
a lower level ranges from 5.1 per 10,000 workers for the Leisure and Hospitality sector to 
11.6 per 10,000 for the Trade, Transportation, and Utility sector. Among specific types of 
falls within this category, falls from ladders represent 6.5 percent of all falls in manufacturing as 
reflected in an injury rate of 1.4 cases per 10,000 workers. Among other sectors, the injury rate 
from falls from ladders ranges from 0.6 per 10,000 workers in the Education and Health Services 
sector to 2.6 per 10,000 in the Trade, Transportation, and Utility sector. In several sectors, falls 
down stairs or steps represent a major share of injuries from falls to a lower level. This type of 
fall is not likely to be prevented by the OSHA standard. Falls from floor openings, loading 
docks, roofs, and scaffolding that are directly addressed by the draft standards make up much 
smaller shares of nonfatal fall accidents.
4.2 FATALITIES AND INJURIES PREVENTABLE BY THE DRAFT SUBPART D 
AND I STANDARDS
4.2.1 Fatalities Prevented
The requirements contained in OSHA’s draft Subpart D and I standards concern safety 
measures designed to prevent accidents such as falls from ladders, scaffolds, unguarded floor 
openings, unprotected platform edges, and so forth. Falls from these types of accidents are 
classified as “falls to lower level” as opposed to “falls on the same level.” The latter type of 
accident might be the result of slips and trips from floor obstructions or wet or slippery working 
surface conditions. Table 4-5 shows the estimated number of annual fatalities from falls in 
General Industry. The base number, 300 fatalities per year, is the average of the number of falls 
in 2003 and 2004 as shown in Table 4-1. ERG allocated this total among the different fall 
categories based on overall fatal fall accident experience from 1992 to 2002 as derived from the 
BLS Census of Occupational Fatalities and summarized in Table 4-2. On this basis, an estimated 
213 fatalities per year result from falls to lower level, while the remaining 87 fatalities result 
from falls on the same level or other types of falls.
4-11
For each category of fall, ERG judged the extent to which the draft Subpart D and I 
standards would be effective in preventing that type of accident. Because the existing standard 
has been in place for over 30 years and since the inspection results show that compliance with 
most paragraphs is quite high (see Table 3-1), ERG used the existing level of fatalities as the 
base against which to judge the preventability of the draft standards. Furthermore, a comparison 
of the draft standards to the existing standards shows that the major changes and additions 
concern requirements for training and inspections, rather than requirements for additional or 
more stringent engineering or work practice controls (see Section Three). 
Studies have shown that well-designed training programs are an effective means to 
improve workplace safety. A NIOSH review of the literature concerning the benefits of training-
related workplace interventions reported that the findings of such studies were nearly unanimous 
in showing that improved and expanded training increases hazard awareness and promotes the 
adoption of safe work practices. While the training literature documents training effectiveness in 
increasing qualitative measures of workplace safety, the quantitative relationship between 
increased training and reduced accident rates remains uncertain (Cohen and Colligan, 1988). For 
this reason, ERG judged the incremental benefits from the draft standards would be modest.
Table 4-5 shows ERG’s preventability judgments for each type of fall. Since much of the 
Subpart D standard focuses on ladder safety, ERG estimated the highest preventability impact of 
15 percent for accidents involving falls from ladders.  For other types of accidents directly 
addressed by the standards (e.g., falls from floor or dock), ERG estimated a moderately high 
preventability impact of 10 percent. For types of fall accidents where the standards are only 
partially relevant (e.g., falls down stairs or steps), ERG estimated a relatively low impact 
(5 percent). Several classes of falls are not specifically defined, and for these, ERG 
estimated a very low level of preventability (2.5 percent). Based on the assumptions, ERG 
estimated that the draft standard might prevent 15 fall fatalities a year or 5.0 percent of the yearly 
total fatal falls in General Industry.
4-12
4.2.2 Injuries Prevented
ERG used the same methodology to estimate the number of serious fall injuries that 
might be prevented by the draft standards. Table 4-6 shows the distribution of lost-workday fall 
injuries by type for General Industry. This distribution is based on 1992 through 2001 data for 
fall injuries involving days away from work, as collected by BLS. These data show that 26.6 
percent of nonfatal fall-related injuries are due to falls to a lower level, while 69.7 percent are the 
result of falls to the same level. ERG estimated the annual number of nonfatal fall injuries by 
applying BLS overall fall injury rates (see Table 4-4) to the total employment levels in General 
Industry sectors (see Table 1-1). These calculations resulted in an estimated 299,522 lost-
workday fall injuries per year. Using the same preventability estimates as were applied to fatal 
accidents, ERG estimated that 4,877 serious fall injuries might be prevented annually by 
compliance with the draft Subpart D and I standards.

SECTION FIVE
5. ECONOMIC IMPACTS
ERG examined the potential impacts of the draft rule two ways—as a percentage of 
revenues and as a percentage of profits. The estimated average receipts and profits by 
establishment and industry are presented in the Table 2-1. ERG estimated 2003 receipts based on 
2002 receipts and payroll data from U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Businesses, 2002 and 
payroll data from U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Businesses, 2003. Receipts are not 
reported for 2003, but were estimated assuming that the ratio of receipts to payroll remained 
unchanged between 2002 and 2003. ERG estimated profits from ratios of net income to total 
receipts as reported for 2003 by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Corporation Source Book. 
Profit data were not available at disaggregated levels for all industries; therefore profit rates at 
more highly aggregated levels were used for such industries.
5.1 ECONOMIC IMPACTS – ALL ESTABLISHMENTS
Table 5-1 summarizes the impact findings for all General Industry establishments 
covered by the draft rule. The first two columns of numbers present the minimum and maximum 
average cost per establishment by industry sector. The average cost per establishment for all 
sectors ranges from $1 to $443. The four industries with the highest average cost per 
establishment are all in manufacturing: services to buildings and dwellings (NAICS 5617, 
$443)), motor vehicle manufacturing (NAICS 3361, $385), water, sewage, and other systems 
(NAICS 2213, $379), and pulp, paper, and paperboard mills (NAICS 3221, $310).
The second pair of numbers lists costs as a percentage of revenue. Costs as a percentage 
of revenues do not exceed eight hundredths of one percent (i.e., 0.08 percent) for any industry 
examined. The industry with the highest percentage of costs to revenues is services to buildings 
and dwellings (NAICS 5617). This industry bears the entire costs of 10 year safety certifications 
of anchorages for window washing (§1910.27(b)(20)(iv)).
5-2
The rightmost pair of numbers lists costs as a percentage of profits. Services to buildings 
and dwellings (NAICS 5617) also has the highest cost as a percentage of profits (2.3 percent). 
All other industries show lower impacts.
Table 5-2 shows the detailed economic impact estimates presented for all 4-digit NAICS 
industries covered by the draft Subpart D and I standards.

5.2 SMALL ENTITY IMPACTS
ERG also estimated compliance costs and economic impacts for small entities affected by 
the draft rule. Tables 2-2 and 2-3 presented above show, respectively, the profiles for General 
Industry entities classified as small according to (1) Small Business Administration (SBA) 
criteria and (2) for entities with fewer than 20 employees. ERG assigned costs to small entities 
by first determining the per employee compliance costs for those cost items that are a function of 
the number of affected employees at a facility, and the per establishment cost for those items that 
do not vary with establishment size. ERG then calculated, by industry, the average number of 
employees for each of the two classes of small entities, multiplied these averages by per 
employee compliance cost, and then added the establishment-based cost to determine the average 
compliance cost for each type of small entity. These statistics multiplied by the numbers of small 
entities produced the total compliance costs in each industry incurred by small entities.
Table 5-3 shows the resultant annualized compliance costs by industry sector for SBA-
defined small entities, while Table 5-4 shows the costs for entities with fewer than 20 employees. 
Compliance costs for SBA-defined small entities totaled $124.7 million, compared to $159.2 
million for all establishments. Compliance costs for the smallest entities totaled $95.4 million.
ERG calculated the economic impacts of these costs by comparing average compliance 
costs with average receipts and profits. These calculations are shown in Tables 5-5 and 5-6. 
Among SBA-defined small entities, impacts of project compliance costs on profits were less than 
five percent for all industries, and these impacts were larger than 1.0 percent for only two 
industries: NAICS 2213, Water, Sewage and Other Systems (4.7 percent); and NAICS 5617, 
Services to Buildings and Dwellings (3.4 percent). For entities with fewer than 20 employees, 
compliance costs as a percent of profits were also less than five percent for all industries, and 
these impacts were larger than one percent for only one industry: NAICS 5617, Services to 
Buildings and Dwellings.

APPENDIX A
ESTIMATED NATIONAL NUMBER OF FIXED LADDERS
GREATER THAN 20 FEET IN HEIGHT
A-2
A.1 Introduction
This appendix summarizes the estimated number of structures with fixed ladders in the 
United States and the number of fixed ladders above 20 feet in height.  To estimate the number 
of fixed ladders above 20 feet in height, ERG contacted industry consultants, associations, 
government agencies, trade journals, and manufacturers. First, ERG identified the structures in 
various industries at which fixed ladders are likely to exist. Second, the number of fixed ladders 
in each industry was estimated. Numerous industry sources, primarily trade association and 
manufacturers, were contacted to develop and revise the fixed ladder estimates.  
Fixed ladders are defined in this report as ladders such as: 1) vertical steel ladders affixed 
to a structure; or 2) individual rung ladders ladder crosspieces which are individually attached to 
a structure, such as the rungs found embedded in the concrete in manholes. By definition, a fixed 
ladder is permanently attached to a structure, building, or equipment; this type of walking-
working surface does not include ship stairs or manhole steps (OSHA, 2003). The fixed ladder 
estimate does not include structures with step bolts such as those found on monopole 
communication towers. 
The following structures were identified as having fixed ladders:
 Ski lift towers
 Communications towers (radio, television, cellular, and microwave)
 Smokestacks and chimneys
 Cooling towers
 Manholes
 Elevator pits
 Power transmission towers
 Silos (grain, plastic, cement, and steel)
 Billboards
 Bridges
 Commercial and apartment buildings:
 Water tanks and towers
 Permanent and mobile amusement rides
 Wind turbines
 Astronomical observatories
 Manufacturing and industrial buildings
A-3
ERG identified other possible structures that might have fixed ladders, such as dams, 
tunnels, and stormwater drainage systems.  However, ERG did not identify data for the number 
of structures or whether they had fixed ladders for these categories.
A.2 Summary
Table A-1 summarizes the estimated count of structures and fixed ladders by type of 
structure.  There are about:
 3.1 million fixed ladders in excess of 20 feet.
 9.9 million manholes, of which 1.485 million are estimated to have fixed ladders 
in excess of 20 feet.
 20,490 billboards with ladders in excess of 20 feet.
Details supporting Table A-1 are in Sections A.3 through A.20 below.
A.3 Ski Lift Towers
ERG contacted the National Ski Areas Association (NSAA) to determine the number of 
ski lift towers in the U.S. The four major types of ski lifts include detachable chair lifts, 
gondolas, fixed grip chair lifts, and surface lifts. All towers that support these lifts have fixed 
ladders. Based on an annual survey of participating resorts around the United States, the number 
of ski lift towers were tallied at 24,088 (NSAA, 2004a). NSAA reported that this information is 
likely to be 80 to 85 percent complete due to survey nonresponse. Thus, ERG inflated the totals 
by 20 percent to 28,906 lift towers with fixed ladders.
Ski towers are climbed on average 2 or 3 times a year for annual inspection and annual 
maintenance (NSAA, 2004b). They are also painted roughly every three years. There is some 
variation in how often lift towers are maintained. Some newer lifts no longer need annual 
lubrication maintenance, while older lifts might require more upkeep. None of the lifts have 
cages on the fixed ladders given the possibility lift riders could get their skis caught in the cages.

few office and multi-family residential buildings use fixed ladders greater than 20 feet in height.
A-5
Based on this data, ERG estimated that all 28,906 estimated fixed ladders on lift towers are 
infrequently climbed.
A.4 Communications Towers (Radio, Television, Cellular, and Microwave)
Virtually all communication towers have fixed ladders. The Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) Antenna Structure Registration Database lists 93,000 registered 
communication towers that have been constructed (FCC, 2007). The database only includes 
towers greater than 199 feet.  ERG contacted Tower Source, a company that compiles 
information on tower locations and leasing information.  Their databases contains approximately 
210,000 structures overall.  About 160,000 are guyed and freestanding towers, all of which have 
fixed ladders.  The remaining 50,000 structures are located on rooftops but they do not record 
whether the antennae are located on the roof itself or on a climbable structure on the roof.  
(Carlise, 2007).  For the purposes of estimating the number of fixed ladders, we assume that 60 
percent of the 50,000 rooftop antennae are on climbable fixed ladders.  This results in an 
estimated 190,000 communications towers.
A.5 Smokestacks and Chimneys
EPA collects information on point sources, such as industrial smokestacks and chimneys 
to track air emissions in the United States.  This database—the National Emissions Inventory 
(NEI) database—is populated with information collected from the states.  EPA posted Version 3 
of the 2002 NEI database point source files in April 2007 (EPA, 2007).  ERG analyzed the file to 
identify individual stacks by combination of unique pairs of facility identification numbers and 
stack height.  The database contained nearly 100,000 stacks (99,984 stacks) of which nearly 
60,000 (57,929) are 20 feet or greater in height.
A.6 Cooling Towers
Cooling towers are used in different industries for purposes such as air conditioning, 
power generation, manufacturing, and at chemical plants. Put simply, the purpose of a tower is to 
A-6
remove excess heat from industrial processes by circulating water.  There are two types of 
cooling towers, natural draft towers and forced draft towers. Natural draft towers are generally 
much larger than forced draft towers, which must use fans in the cooling process. Examples of a 
natural draft tower include the large chimney structures that are constructed at nuclear power 
plants. Contacts with a safety expert indicate that cooling towers generally have fixed ladders 
(Ellis, 2004). 
The cooling tower estimate was revised to include electric power generation plants that 
use cooling towers. Towers at power generation plants are used to condense steam that turns the 
generators. The 1997 Economic Census reports 13,513 chemical manufacturing plants, whereas 
EPA’s Risk Management Program counts 15,000 facilities (Census, 1997; EPA, 2004). Each of 
these plants has approximately five sections, each with one tower that has two 12-foot sections of 
ladder (Ellis, 2004). ERG counted these two sections as one ladder for the purposes of this 
analysis for a total of 75,000 ladders.
The 2002 Economic Census identifies 1,997 (Census, 2002a) power generation plants in 
operation. While no substantial data was available about the frequency with which these ladders 
are climbed, consultants indicated that they were climbed more often than twice a year and thus 
ERG assumed that none of these ladders are infrequently climbed (Ellis, 2004).
Based on discussions with industry sources, the majority of cooling towers are forced 
draft towers which are not over twenty feet high, and do not have fixed ladders over twenty feet 
high. A small number of the largest power plants in operation do have natural draft cooling 
towers that are several stories high. Nuclear power plants generally employ natural draft towers 
in a plant design. There were 73 nuclear power plants in operation in the United States according 
to the 2002 United States Economic Census (Census, 2002a). 
A.6 Manholes 
Manholes serve as access points for sewer system maintenance and may have fixed 
ladders installed. ERG found no estimates of the number of manholes or underground chambers. 
A-7
In 1999, however, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated that there are 750,000 
miles of public sewer in the U.S. (Albee, 2004). Based on an analysis of websites that specify 
standards for spacing manholes of 300 to 600 feet apart, ERG estimated that 750,000 miles of 
public sewer might 6.6 to 13.2 million manholes, for an average of 9.9 million manholes. While 
some manholes have fixed ladders in the form of rungs that are embedded in concrete, many are 
climbed into using temporary ladders. One contact at a municipal sewer department noted that 
the individual rungs are considered unsafe by the industry due to corrosion and other degradation 
problems (Kido, 2004). Another noted that individual rungs are usually not found in older sewer 
systems, but that he had used them to climb into shallow manholes (Dailey, 2004). 
Most manholes are not deeper than 20 feet based conversations with officials at 
municipal sewer departments (Meehan, 2004 and Kido, 2004). One official noted that the 
manholes greater than 20 feet are generally climbed every 5 years for inspections and that they 
compose a minority of the manholes, likely around 10 percent (Kido, 2004). In order not to 
underestimate the number of fixed ladders for which costs might be incurred, ERG rounds up the 
estimate to 15 percent.  Thus, 15 percent of the estimated 9.9 million manholes, or 1.485 million 
manholes might be deeper than 20 feet and might have fixed ladders.
A.7 Elevator Pits
According to the industry’s trade journal, Elevator World, the number of elevators in the 
U.S. is roughly estimated at 675,000 as of the year 2000 (Clothier, 2004). Other consultants have 
indicated this might be a low, but could not provide any better estimates (Beyer, 2004). One 
consultant indicated that roughly 95% of elevators have fixed ladders (Beyer, 2004).  National 
Inspection Services notes that the depth of the elevator pit varies with elevator speed.  A car 
traveling at 100 feet per minute requires a 4-foot pit while a car traveling at 600 feet per minute 
requires a 7-foot pit (NIS, 2007).  Thus, with the exception of extremely high-speed elevators in 
the tallest buildings, elevator pits are unlikely to have fixed ladders in excess of 20 feet.
A-8
A.8 Transmission Towers
In 2004, the United States had approximately 160,000 miles of high voltage transmission 
line (EIA, 2004).  Weisbrich and Weisbrich (2004) indicate a transmission tower spacing of 
about 5 towers per mile.  ERG combined the information to estimate about 800,000 high voltage 
transmission towers nationwide.
ERG also spoke to a large electricity provider (Putnam, 2004). He noted that of most 
transmission towers accessed via aerial lifts, less than 2 percent of towers are likely to be 
climbed .  Taking two percent of 800,000 transmission towers results in an estimated 16,000 
towers that are likely to be climbed.
A.9 Silos
Industries that use silos include plastics plants, chemical plants, foundries, coal plants, 
cement plants, grain mills, beef and dairy farms, and aluminum processors, among others. Given 
the wide variation of the number of silos at each facility and by industry, ERG was  not able to 
obtain accurate estimates on the number of silos in the U.S. broken down by industry. Based on 
his knowledge of the average number of silos in some industries, one consultant estimated 
1,000,000 silos exist across all industries (Ellis, 2004). Another contact at the International Silos 
Association (ISA) estimated that there might be roughly 70,000 working forage silos at livestock 
and dairy farms in the U.S., all of which have fixed ladders, on the interior and the exterior (ISA, 
2004).
A large silo manufacturer estimated that 80 to 90 percent of silos have fixed ladders 
outfitted with cages (Miller, 2004). Based on this data, ERG assumed that 85 percent of silos 
have fixed ladders higher than 20 feet. 
A-9
A.10 Billboards
Based on discussions with the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA, 
2005) the number of billboards with fixed ladders over 20 feet in length is now estimated at 
20,490. The OAAA provided this estimate from member comments and a survey completed in 
2003. 
A.11 Bridges
According to statistics maintained by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal 
Highway Administration, there were 592,246 bridges constructed as of 2004 (FHWA, 2004a). 
Most bridges do not have fixed ladders. The bridges that are most likely to have fixed ladders are 
movable bridges, which require the ladders for maintenance work on the mechanical and 
electrical equipment (FHWA, 2004b). Moveable bridges make up a small number, 0.15 percent, 
of all bridges in the United States according to the FHWA data. Bucket trucks and inspection 
platforms are generally used to do work on bridges.  Thus, there are an estimated 872 fixed
ladders on bridges.
A.12 Commercial and Apartment Buildings
The Department of Energy reports that there are 4.7 million commercial buildings in the 
U.S. in 1999, most of which are office, retail, warehouse, and storage buildings.  Seventy-nine 
percent of these buildings are one story tall  (DOE, 2002). Buildings only one story tall can 
access roofs from the exterior with a temporary ladder, negating the need for a fixed ladder.  
Taller buildings usually provide access to a roof by stairwell.  Based on these observations, ERG 
concluded that very few residential and commercial buildings have fixed ladders. These 
estimates do not include fire escapes, which ERG assumed were not covered by the standard.
A-10
A.13 Water Tanks and Towers
The EPA defines a community water system as a public water system that serves at least 
15 service connections used by year-round residents or regularly serves at least 25 year-round 
residents. These range from small, privately owned systems to huge public systems serving 
millions.
The 2000 Community Water System Survey shows there are 53,410 such systems. Water 
tanks and/or towers provide storage for these systems (EPA, 2002). Whether a water tank or 
tower is used for water storage depends largely on the geography of the area and varies widely 
across the U.S. One manufacturer of water towers suggested that areas with mountainous terrain 
can sustain water pressure in a drinking system by constructing tanks on high ground. While 
ERG was not able to collect any data on the number of water tanks or towers per system (a 
system could have more than one tank and/or tower), ERG assumed one tank or tower per 
system as a lower bound on the actual number of water tanks and towers in the U.S. 
Based on discussions with the safety director of a large manufacturer of water towers and 
tanks, all water tanks and towers have fixed ladders. They are climbed about 2 to 3 times a year 
to get birds nests off the top, for maintenance, to put cellular antennas up, and to replace light 
bulbs (Rudy, 2004). ERG assumed that the fixed ladders on water towers and tanks are all 
infrequently climbed, although a small percentage might be climbed more frequently if more 
frequent repairs are needed, especially to the cellular antennae.
A.14 Permanent and Mobile Amusement Rides
While there are 320 permanent amusement parks in the U.S., very few have rides that 
require fixed ladders. Some of the rides inside buildings have fixed ladders, but the vast majority 
is climbed using a catwalk. There are very few permanent rides that have fixed ladders higher 
than 20 feet; an estimate of such rides ranges from 300 to 400 rides. These are climbed every day 
for maintenance access and to check rides before they start (King, 2004). For estimating the 
number of fixed ladders nationwide, ERG took the mid-point of the estimate (350 ladders).
A-11
With respect to mobile amusement parks, there are likely about 100 to 200 rides that 
might have fixed ladders higher than 20 feet (OABA, 2004). Again, none of these rides are 
infrequently climbed as they are set up and dismantled once a week during the summer months. 
Furthermore, these ladders are also used for maintenance access. Some mobile parks also operate 
year round.  For estimating the number of fixed ladders nationwide, ERG took the mid-point of 
the estimate (150 ladders).
A.17 Wind Turbines
The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) reports that there currently are 6,500 
wind turbines in the U.S. Some are lattice structures and do not have fixed ladders. AWEA 
estimates that roughly 5,000 wind turbines have fixed ladders (AWEA, 2004).
Wind turbines are generally only climbed when there is a problem with the operation of 
the turbine. A large operator and manager of wind energy projects throughout the U.S. noted that 
turbines are generally climbed 2 to 3 times a year for scheduled maintenance and 2 to 3 times a 
year to make unscheduled repairs. Overall, the turbines are climbed 4 to 6 times a year. Thus, 
fixed ladders on wind turbines are not infrequently climbed.
A.18 Windmills
Preliminary research into water pumping windmills indicate that they are historic 
structures and are fairly small in number in the United States (30-40 in the US). Windmills can 
be found in California; Cape Cod, Massachusetts; and on Long Island, New York (Windmill, 
2005). 
A.19 Astronomical Observatories
The number of observatories in the United States overall is very small overall, 12 
facilities (Encyclopedia, 2005). Observatories are usually comprised of several structures 
A-12
housing telescopes and other observation equipment that contain fixed ladders. A discussion was 
held with the staff from the Kech Observatory located at Mauna Kea, Hawaii (Dill, 2005). The 
dome at the Kech Observatory structure is 100 feet high and has multiple ladders. ERG assumed 
that on average there were 5 fixed ladders for each facility based on initial photographic 
observations (e.g., http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/).
A.20 Manufacturing and Industrial Buildings
ERG searched the 2002 Economic Census database for the number of manufacturing 
establishments.  The number, as of June 2007, is 350,866 establishments (Census, 2002b).  For 
the purpose of estimating the number of fixed ladders in the United States, ERG assumed one 
fixed ladder per establishment.
